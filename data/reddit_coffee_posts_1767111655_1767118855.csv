Context: I (24F) am pretty chill and have my share of friends. I’ve only hated one person in my life, and I hate it because I try to see the good in people, or just ignore those who I think are jerks (but sometimes jerks just happen to be your roommates, so lucky). I’m determined to get what I want, but I rarely know what I want. My favourite color is any shade of blue, my favourite pokemon is Luxray. I used to be a sporty kid, I was always outside playing (mostly getting myself dirty with anything that I could use, once, I painted myself blue because I wanted to see if I could become the sky). I study literature and do research in that field. I wanted to be an astronaut or an archaeologist. My high school was focused on studying scientific subjects (in Italy we have specific topic-related high schools), and I was good at everything, except history and philosophy. But not because I wasn’t good at it (at university I took the maximum on those exams), it was because I hated the teacher and she hated me because I spoke my mind when she was spreading misinformation. During my teenage years I wasn’t doing well mentally, so I was gloomy all the time and I thought the world hated me. Now I’m good again. I drink too much coffee, procrastinate what I don’t feel like doing in the moment (have fun first, suffer later). I’m a bit paranoid.

Other stuff (chat gpt gave some results, but we all know IA is not accurate and kinda sucks).

- Astrology big 3: Libra sun (cuspid w Scorpio), Sagittarius rising, Taurus moon.
- Top music genre: Rock, Art rock, New Wave, Musicals
- Favourite animal: Cat/Big Cats (+ Ravens)
- Favourite Pokémon game: Black&White
- Core Animal: White tiger
- Bending: Lightning-type Firebender
- Pokemon type that represents me: Lightning/Dark (DUUHHH chat gpt)
- Hogwarts house: Slytherin 
- Patronus: Big gray cat (chat gpt told me it was the white tiger but pottermore put a cat + I honestly think if I had a patrons it would resemble my childhood cat).

1pzpdfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beingabetterperson/comments/1pzpdfp/the_subtle_habits_that_make_people_instantly/,The Subtle Habits That Make People Instantly RESPECT You: Science-Based Psychology Cheat Codes,"okay so i spent way too much time studying this. like actually researching what makes certain people command respect without even trying. read dozens of books on psychology, watched interviews with charisma coaches, listened to podcasts about human behavior. and honestly? most advice out there is recycled garbage.

the truth is way more interesting. respect isn't about being the loudest person in the room or having the fanciest job title. it's abo ut these tiny behavioral patterns that signal competence, authenticity, and emotional intelligence. most people miss them entirely.

here's what actually works:

**stop explaining yourself constantly**

this one hit different when i first learned about it. robert greene talks about this in **""the 48 laws of power""** (yeah i know it sounds manipulative but hear me out). the book is basically a historical analysis of power dynamics, written by a guy who studied strategy under hollywood executives.

when you over explain your decisions, you subconsciously signal insecurity. ""sorry i can't make it tonight, my cat has a vet appointment and also i have this work thing and honestly i've been really tired lately and..."" vs ""i can't make it tonight, but let's reschedule soon.""

people who respect themselves don't feel the need to justify every choice. they just state their boundaries clearly and move on. it's not about being rude. it's about understanding that your time and decisions have inherent value.

**master the pause**

this comes from negotiation research and honestly it's kind of wild how effective it is. chris voss (former fbi hostage negotiator) breaks this down in ""never split the difference"". before he was teaching negotiation tactics, he was literally talking people off ledges and negotiating kidnapping releases.

when someone asks you something, especially something challenging, don't rush to fill the silence. pause. think. then respond. rushing signals anxiety. pausing signals confidence and thoughtfulness.

people unconsciously interpret that pause as ""this person's thoughts are valuable enough to require consideration."" sounds weird but it works. even in casual conversation, that extra second before responding makes people lean in more.

**fix your posture but make it subtle**

not like military rigid. just... taking up your space. amy cuddy's research on body language (yeah the ted talk person) found that how you hold yourself literally changes your hormone levels. expansive postures increase testosterone and decrease cortisol.

but here's the thing nobody talks about: it's not about power posing in front of people. it's about training your default resting position. shoulders back, chin level, feet planted. when this becomes automatic, people perceive you as more capable without knowing why.

there's this app called ""posture pal"" that randomly buzzes you throughout the day to check in. sounds annoying but after like two weeks it becomes automatic.

**listen like you're getting paid for it**

most people listen just enough to figure out when they can talk next. real respect comes from making others feel genuinely heard.

practical tip: when someone finishes speaking, pause for one full second before responding. then reference something specific they said. ""you mentioned feeling overwhelmed with the project timeline, what part is causing the most stress?""

the book ""just listen"" by mark goulston (psychiatrist who worked with fbi on hostage situations, similar to voss) explains this perfectly. he calls it ""listening with fascination"" rather than listening with judgment or advice queued up.

people will literally describe you as ""so intelligent"" and ""such good company"" when really you just... listened well. wild but true.

**disagree without being disagreeable**

this is from ""difficult conversations"" by the harvard negotiation project team. instead of ""no you're wrong about that"" try ""interesting, i see it a bit differently because...""

you can hold your ground without making someone feel stupid. that's rare. people respect the hell out of someone who can challenge their ideas while still making them feel respected. it signals intellectual confidence rather than ego protection.

**stop apologizing for existing**

""sorry, can i ask a quick question?"" no. just ""hey, quick question.""

""sorry for the long email"" becomes ""thanks for reading.""

""sorry i'm late"" (when you're 2 minutes late) becomes ""thanks for waiting.""

reframing apologies into gratitude shifts the entire dynamic. apologizing constantly trains people to see you as someone who's always in the wrong. thanking them positions you as equals.

there's this concept in psychology called ""self deprecation bias"" where people think constant apologies make them seem humble and likeable. research shows it actually does the opposite. makes people perceive you as less competent.

**follow through on tiny commitments**

this is probably the most underrated one. ""i'll send you that article"" and then actually sending it. ""let's grab coffee soon"" and then actually suggesting a time within a week.

people are drowning in flaky behavior. when you're the person who actually does what they say, even with small stuff, you become memorable. your word starts carrying weight.

the compound effect of this is insane. after six months of being reliable with little things, people start trusting you with bigger things. they recommend you. they want you around.

**own your mistakes quickly and specifically**

""my bad"" is lazy. ""i messed up the timeline on that report, here's how i'm fixing it"" shows accountability and competence simultaneously.

people don't lose respect when you make mistakes. they lose respect when you deflect, make excuses, or pretend it didn't happen. brené brown's research on vulnerability (she's a shame and empathy researcher at university of houston) found that people who own their failures are perceived as more trustworthy and capable.

**stop filling every silence with noise**

comfortable silence is a dominance display in the animal kingdom and honestly? still applies to humans. when you're okay with quiet moments in conversation, it signals security. anxious people fill every gap with chatter.

next time you're in a group setting, notice who's comfortable with silence and who's scrambling to fill it. the comfortable ones tend to command more respect.

**other resources that helped**

BeFreed is an AI learning app built by Columbia alumni that creates personalized podcasts from books, research papers, and expert talks. What makes it useful is the adaptive learning plan, it actually builds a structured path based on your specific goals and struggles. You can adjust the depth too, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with detailed examples depending on your mood.

The voice customization is legitimately addictive. There's a smoky, sarcastic option that makes even dry psychology concepts entertaining during commutes. Plus there's a virtual coach avatar you can chat with to ask questions or get book recommendations. Helps turn all these concepts into something you can actually internalize through flashcards and a personal mindspace feature. Worth checking out if you're serious about consistent growth.

real talk though, this isn't about manipulating people or playing mind games. it's about developing genuine self respect that naturally radiates outward. people can smell fake confidence from a mile away. but when you actually value yourself, set boundaries, and show up authentically? that's what creates lasting respect.

none of this happens overnight. took me months to internalize even half of these. but the shift is noticeable. people started asking my opinion more. including me in decisions. taking my time seriously.

Diane stepped out of the elevator into the grand, spacious lobby of her midtown office, its ceiling adorned with vibrant murals of iconic capital cities.

Nick stood by the security desk, chatting with a sixty-something guard, likely about his beloved Rangers.""

Diane tried to steady her nerves. She was undeniably drawn to Nick—an educated, successful, handsome, and charming man. Being asked out by someone like him felt flattering, almost surreal.

When Nick spotted her, he cut his hockey talk short.

""I don't know what you did upstairs, but you look incredible.""

Diane blushed. ""Just a touch of blush and lipstick. Didn't want to look like I worked all day.""

""Well, I added some extra hair gel and cologne myself,"" Nick said with a grin. ""Wasn't gonna mention it, but since you did...""

They both laughed, the ice melting between them.

""Do you like seafood?"" Nick asked. ""There's a spot in the Village with killer surf and turf.""

""I'd love that,"" Diane said. ""Where I'm from, dinner out means Italian or Chinese. Seafood's a nice change.""

""Change can be good,"" Nick said with a smile. ""Come on, I'm parked across the street.""

The lot attendant spotted Nick, grinned, and darted to fetch his car. Moments later, he pulled around the corner in a sleek BMW 325e—the quintessential yuppie car, screaming ambition and polish. It suited Nick perfectly: successful, refined, and self-assured.

The attendant hopped out, and Nick slipped him a bill with a practiced ease. Diane noted it, impressed. Danny pulled off similar moves, but where Danny was rough like sandpaper, Nick was smooth as fine Egyptian cotton.

Nick drove downtown, weaving effortlessly through the city's bustling streets. New York hummed  with after-work crowds and tourists diving into the sights and shops.

He parked on Bleecker Street, right by The Clipper Seafood Bar. Darkness had settled in, but the restaurant's glowing neon lights cast a warm, inviting vibe.

Nick hurried around to open Diane's door, offering his hand. As she stepped out, her eyes locked onto his, searching, almost piercing. The urge to pull each other into a kiss hung between them, unspoken. Instead, they walked into the restaurant and were led to a cozy corner table in the back. 

Fishing poles and nets lined the walls, giving the place the cozy, lived-in feel of an old fishing boat.

""So, here we are,"" Nick said, easing into the conversation with a hint of awkwardness.

""Here we are,"" Diane replied, feeling a surge of confidence as his gaze made her feel desired.

""I spend a lot of time in the city,"" Nick said. ""Grew up in Manhasset, Long Island. My family's got a place in the Hamptons, right on the beach. Maybe you'll check it out this summer.""

He wasn't bragging, just being himself—open, genuine, the only way he knew how.

""Makes me wish it was summer already,"" Diane said. ""Do you still live on Long Island?""

""Nah,"" Nick said. ""My family does. After graduating Villanova and starting at Desmond and Johnson, I got an apartment on 79th and York. Feels like I'm in the heart of everything.""

""I'd love to live in the city someday,"" Diane admitted. ""Brooklyn's great, especially the people, but it's something I'd like to move on from eventually.""

""That's how I felt about Long Island,"" Nick said. ""Loved growing up there, but I needed to break free."" He paused, then added, ""I can see going back someday, though—once I meet the right woman, settle down, start a family.""

Diane smiled. ""That shouldn't be hard for you. You're a catch—handsome, successful, charming. I could fall for you in a heartbeat. But I need to be honest, for both our sakes. I'm still with my boyfriend. I don't know how long that'll last, but for now...""

""For now, let's be friends—at least, I hope we can be,"" Nick said, his tone earnest. ""But I need to be honest, too, for both our sakes. You're incredible, Diane. Your marketing skills are top-notch, and your future's bright. I hope this isn't too forward, but you're the most beautiful woman I've ever met. I felt that way the moment I saw you. So, let's order a great meal, kick back, and keep getting to know each other. Friends.""

Diane smiled. ""The surf and turf sounds perfect.""
Nick waved over the waiter. ""We'll both have the surf and turf, and a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon.""

""You're not making this easy, are you?"" Diane teased, her eyes playful.

""Can't say,"" Nick replied with a grin. ""Guess we'll see what happens.""

After dinner, Nick asked for the check, slipping his corporate card into the leather folder. When the waiter returned it, Nick tipped generously in cash—a practiced ritual, Diane noted.

""Let me drive you home,"" Nick offered.

""That's sweet, but I don't want to put you out,"" Diane said. ""I'll take the train.""

""Come on,"" Nick said. ""You've seen how I drive. I'll have you home and be back at my place in no time.""

She relented with a smile and slid into his car. When he pulled up to her house, they sat in silence for a moment.

""Well, this is me,"" Diane said, breaking the quiet.

""See you at work tomorrow,"" Nick said. ""Thanks for an amazing evening getting to know you.""

Diane hesitated, then leaned in slightly. ""I think you should kiss me goodnight, Nick. Otherwise, we'll both be up all night thinking about it, and I need some sleep.""

""Agreed,"" he said with a chuckle. ""Wouldn't want to dock you for being late.""

He leaned over, and their kiss was long, passionate, but stopped short of crossing a line that would've sent them back to his place.

They agreed to keep work and personal lives separate—for now. But as Nick had said over dinner, they'd start as friends and see where it led.

Chapter 22- Happy Birthday Debbie 

I strolled into the office that morning, ready to settle in. I set my two hefty loose-leaf binders—packed with essential cheat sheets—on my desk, propped one foot up (just one, per the collective bargaining agreement), and sipped my fresh-brewed deli coffee.

Stan arrived earlier than usual, dropping his briefcase—mostly stuffed with lunch and music trade magazines—onto his desk. He waved me over urgently.

I got up, hoping it wasn't work-related since we still had twenty minutes before the clock started.

""Gerry,"" Stan whispered, like he was sharing a state secret, ""it's Debbie's birthday today. She told me yesterday, so I asked her to dinner, and she said yes!"" His eyes gleamed with excitement.

""Okay,"" I said, unimpressed.

""No, you don't get it,"" he said. ""We were drinking wine.""

""And?"" I asked, skeptical.

Stan stared at me like I'd grown three heads. ""The restaurant was dimly lit. Candlelight. We were looking into each other's eyes.""

""And?"" I said again, waiting for a punchline I knew wasn't coming.

His eyes narrowed, frustration creeping in, one eyebrow arched. ""A violinist was wandering the restaurant. He stopped at our table and played a romantic Italian song just for us.""

I paused, letting it sink in. ""So, you treated Debbie to a nice birthday dinner, she gave you a friendly peck on the cheek, and you both went home alone."" I patted his back. ""You're a good friend, Stan.""

I glanced back as I returned to my desk. He sat there, staring straight ahead, biting the inside of his cheek.

Just then, Debbie breezed in. ""Good morning, guys!"" she said cheerfully.

""Morning,"" I said. ""Happy birthday!""

""Aw, thanks, Gerry!"" she said, flashing a smile and giving me the same friendly peck on the cheek Stan had gotten post-dinner.

I settled back at my desk, leaving Stan to stew in his thoughts.

Vinnie called Steve and me to join him at the eighth-floor wire panels. As first-wave digital technicians, we were green compared to veterans like Vinnie, who'd spent years mastering analog systems.

He studied a piece of engineering paper in his hand. The circuit he was troubleshooting was down hard—a critical line feeding the New York Stock Exchange's ticker, keeping brokers updated on trading quotes.

Vinnie suspected a broken wire right at the panel. Normally, we'd open a ticket for N-Tech to handle, but he saw a chance to teach Steve and me how these circuits were wired.

""Alright,"" Vinnie said, taking charge. ""We're getting on the floor under the panel. Steve, you're in the middle. Gerry, take the far end. I'll tug this wire. Steve, when you see it move, pull back so we know it's good up to there.""

Steve spotted a wire shifting and pulled it taut. ""Got it,"" he said.

""See?"" Vinnie said. ""We're good to that point. Gerry, you seeing any movement on your end?""

""Nothing, Vinnie,"" I said.

""Just as I thought,"" he said. ""Steve, now pull the wire toward Gerry's side.""

Steve complied as Vinnie traced the wiring between us. 

""There it is,"" Vinnie said, pointing. ""The wire's frayed right here."" He pulled a splicing tool from his pocket and deftly repaired it. I tugged from my side, and Steve confirmed he could see the movement.

""Good work, guys,"" Vinnie said. ""Think we got it.""

He called down to Sandy. ""Sand Man, check the circuit I left on my desk. Restored yet?""

""Clean and green, Vincent,"" Sandy replied. ""It's back up.""

""Nice job, gentlemen,"" Vinnie said. ""I'm sure the brokers are thrilled. I'll give them a call.""

We thanked Vinnie for the lesson. Learning something new was always a rush, and most of our seasoned mentors, like Vinnie, were eager to share their expertise—well, most of the time.

By the time we returned to our desks, it was almost break time. Vinnie had called the Stock Exchange to report the fix, then closed out his ticket. 

Turning to Steve and me, he grinned. ""You boys earned your keep today. Come join us in the alley.""

No way we'd turn down Vinnie's invite. The crew—Vinnie, Sandy, Dead, Steve, and I—headed to the alley, where Vinnie sparked up a joint.

It wasn't fat, but it didn't need to be. That was some quality weed. A couple of tokes each, and I was as mellow as a smooth jazz saxophonist.

Sandy, as usual when he's high, started giggling. I couldn't resist—grabbed him under the arms and tickled him. His giggles turned into full-on belly laughs, and soon we were all cracking up.

Back at our desks, we'd mostly pulled ourselves together. Not Sandy though. He was laughing so hard tears streamed down his face. 
""Freaking Gerry,"" he gasped between chuckles.

Vinnie smirked. ""I haven't seen him lose it like this since we saw Big Bamboo with Cheech and Chong.""

It wasn't until lunchtime that Sandy's laughter finally died down. He made me promise never to tickle him again. I swore I wouldn't, but I crossed my fingers behind my back—just in case.

I heard later that Ramy took Kenny and Pete up to N-Tech, just as Vinnie had done with Steve and me earlier. He'd pinpointed the issue to a faulty D4 channel card and offered to show them how to replace it.

During our afternoon break workout, I cornered Gary to get the scoop. He explained that he'd gotten the green light from the N-Tech manager to let us tag along and troubleshoot a few issues firsthand, so we could see what the job really entailed. Gary didn't just have our backs—he had all our sides covered.

When I got home that evening, I hopped straight into the shower. Mary called out that I didn't need to cook—she was craving stir-fried veggies and chicken in the wok her mom had given us as a housewarming gift.

She walked in just as I was toweling off. Without missing a beat, she started cooking, and soon the kitchen was filled with the mouthwatering aroma of sizzling vegetables and chicken.

We sat down to eat, and she set steaming plates in front of us. I took a bite and grinned.
""Hon, you've outdone yourself. This is absolutely delicious.""

""Thanks,"" she said with a smile. ""Just soy sauce and a little duck sauce magic.""

I leaned back, savoring the meal. ""So, Stan took Debbie out to dinner last night for her birthday. Not sure what's going on with that guy. Guess he wants to dance close to the flame without getting burned.""

Mary raised an eyebrow. ""Stan's married, right? That wouldn't fly with you. Does his wife know?""

""Nah,"" I said, shaking my head. ""Stan's just a frustrated crooner, stroking his ego now and then. Besides, Debbie's into girls.""

Mary gave a sarcastic chuckle. ""Oh, well, that makes it all fine then. But don't let me catch you out with Debbie—or any other girl, gay or straight. I'll stroke more than your ego—and you won't like it.""

""No worries, Tiger,"" I said, laughing. ""I checked my ego at the door the day I met you.""

Mary grinned, then her face lit up. ""Oh, I'm so happy Angie's back at work. She said she had a blast getting to know Jeff's folks. They're even planning to have us over to try some new kosher dishes Jeff's mom taught her.""

We kept the conversation flowing. I had her cracking up with the story of Sandy's uncontrollable giggles at work. After dinner, I cleared the table while she tackled the dishes.

We settled onto the couch, flipping on MTV for some music videos. I leaned in, kissing the back of her neck. 

""You know you're my one and only.""

She turned to me, her eyes sparkling with mischief. ""And you're mine. But I'm not making any promises if a hot gay guy starts working with me.""

I laughed, pulling her closer. ""Deal. As long as I get to watch you fend him off with that fiery charm of yours.""

We sank deeper into the cushions, the music filling the room as we traded playful jabs, content in our little world.

Chapter 23- First Of Many

Andre was getting ready for his first date with Linda. He showered, blow-dried his hair, and spritzed on the new cologne a coworker had sworn by.

He slipped into the light blue button-down shirt he'd picked up on 86th Street, paired with crisp dress pants. Studying his reflection, he gave himself one last once-over. He looked as sharp as he could manage. A deep breath later, he was ready.

It was Saturday night—the classic night for couples. Downstairs in the basement, his parents and sister were gathered around the dinner table.

""Let me look at you,"" his mom said warmly. ""Very handsome. If you weren't my son, I might just fall for you myself.""

""No tie?"" his dad asked, glancing up from his beef stew with a teasing grin.

""Nah, no tie,"" Andre replied. ""It's just dinner at New Corners. Don't want to come off too eager.""

His dad smirked. ""Maybe your mom and I will swing by incognito to check how your date's going.""

""Yeah, right,"" Andre laughed, heading for the door.

This time, the nerves weren't as sharp as they'd been when he'd taken Dean's cousin Elizabeth out. He already knew Linda. They'd met at Ernie Barry's, shared drinks, talked, even danced. Since then, there had been a few phone calls, enough to make this feel easy.

He hopped on the Belt Parkway toward Marine Park, where Linda lived with her mom,  just a few blocks from Mary's folks' house.

Upstairs, Linda slipped into a loose gray dress that fell just below her knees—comfortable, elegant, and perfectly her. She carried a few extra pounds and stood just shy of average height, but her warm smile and sparkling personality made her light up any room.

They probably wouldn't have met at all if Gerry hadn't practically pushed them together at Ernie Barry's. But from that first conversation, something had clicked.

Linda had planned a quiet night with Mary and their friends. Andre had figured it would be iced teas and going home alone. Fate—and Gerry's meddling—had other plans.

Andre pulled into the driveway, took a breath, and rang the doorbell.

""Hello! Come on in,"" greeted a plump, cheerful woman with Linda's same bright smile.

""I'm Linda's mom—Mary's Aunt Terry. I hear you're Gerry's pal.""

""Yes, I am,"" Andre replied, shaking her hand a little awkwardly. ""Gerry and I go way back.""

Just then, Linda came bounding down the stairs. ""I could hear you from my room and figured I'd better hustle down before Mom talks your ear off.""

""Nah, we were just getting started,"" Terry said with a laugh.

Linda looped her arm through Andre's, kissed her mom on the cheek, and said, ""Don't wait up, Ma. I'll see you in the morning.""

""Okay, I won't. Have fun, you two,"" Terry called. ""Andre, it was nice meeting you!""

""Same here. Hopefully, we'll chat more next time,"" Andre replied with a smile.

⸻

Andre parked across from New Corner in a diagonal spot—his go-to place for family dinners. He walked around to open Linda's door and offered his hand as she stepped down from the truck. Her fingers stayed wrapped around his as they crossed the street.

New Corner was family-owned, the warmth of it visible in every detail—framed family photos on the walls, soft lighting, and thick carpeting that made the place feel like home.

Gino greeted them with a smile and led them to a cozy table. Andre pulled out Linda's chair before sitting down.

""We've got three specials tonight,"" Gino said. ""Red snapper with buttery sauce, chicken Francese with potatoes and mixed vegetables, and prime rib with broccoli rabe. What can I get started for drinks?""

""I'll have a Budweiser,"" Andre said.

""Same for me,"" Linda added.

The busboy set down water and a basket of warm bread.

""I love your shirt, Andre,"" Linda said. ""You look so handsome.""

""Thanks,"" he replied, grinning. ""You're looking beautiful, as always—even if this is only our second time meeting.""

Linda laughed. ""Good one.""

She tapped the menu. ""I think I'll go with the tortellini Alfredo. I'm a sucker for Alfredo sauce.""

""I love it too,"" Andre said. ""But I never order it out. I make it at home—it's incredible. Restaurants can't compete.""

""Big talk!"" Linda teased. ""Guess I'll skip it tonight and hold you to making it for me sometime.""

Gino returned with their beers. Andre ordered two prime ribs with broccoli rabe, and Linda nodded her approval.

""You're quite the Renaissance man, Mr. Andre,"" Linda teased. ""Hunter, handyman, and now chef? I'm surprised some girl hasn't snatched you up.""

Andre chuckled. ""That's what everyone says—especially Gerry. Guess the right girl hasn't come along yet.""

Linda tilted her head, playful. ""Well, we'll see about that.""

Dinner arrived on a silver tray, the prime rib perfectly pink and juicy. Linda tried broccoli rabe for the first time—bitter at first, but by the end, she'd warmed to it.

""This feels like a wedding feast,"" Andre joked.

Linda laughed. ""The food, maybe. But I don't see a dance floor.""

Andre leaned back, satisfied. ""I'm stuffed.""

""I feel just right,"" Linda said. ""This meal did not disappoint.""

Andre met her gaze. ""Nothing about tonight has.""

""Mary invited us for a nightcap,"" Linda said. ""What do you think?""

""I'm too mellow for a club,"" Andre said with a grin. ""I'm in.""

Linda called Mary from the payphone up front. Andre paid the check while she waited.

""She says to come over,"" Linda said when she returned. ""They're watching an old movie Gerry rented from Blockbuster.""

They walked out hand in hand.

⸻

Andre parked in front of Gerry and Mary's apartment. The three-flight climb worked off a bit of dinner, though they were laughing and slightly breathless by the top.

Mary flung open the door. ""Come on in, you guys!""

Andre kissed her cheek. Gerry stood, hugging Linda.

""I picked up some B&B today,"" Gerry said with a grin. ""Figured you'd want your go-to.""

""Perfect,"" Andre replied.

Mary tugged Linda into the kitchen while Andre sank onto the couch.

""So?"" Mary asked. ""How was it?""

Linda's smile was soft, glowing. ""Oh, Mary, it was amazing. Better than amazing. I think I'm in love.""

In the living room, Gerry leaned toward Andre. ""Well?""

Andre's grin said everything. ""Best night of my life. I think I'm in love.""

Mary and Linda returned with the B&B and four cognac glasses. Gerry poured and raised his glass.

""To Andre and Linda's first date,"" he said warmly. ""May it be the first of many.""

Glasses clinked. The amber liquid caught the light, and the night felt like the start of something real.

Chapter 24- May December 

That same night, Big Kenny held court at Studio 54's velvet rope, his massive frame filling the doorway like a bouncer carved from granite.

Elaine and her friend Keira approached, and Kenny's stern face cracked into a grin. He pulled Elaine into a bear hug, then turned to Keira with the same easy warmth.

""Elaine! Glad you made it. The place is electric tonight—you two are in for a hell of a ride.""

""We wouldn't miss it,"" Elaine said, beaming. ""Kenny, meet Keira. She's my neighbor from the building.""

Keira, another forty-something divorcee, looked stunning in a backless black mini dress that hugged her curves and turned heads. ""I've dreamed of this place for years. Thank you so much for getting us in.""

""My pleasure,"" Kenny rumbled, squeezing Elaine's hand. ""Elaine and I are good friends. You ladies have a blast.""

""Will you join us for a drink later?"" Elaine asked, tilting her head.

""Count on it,"" Kenny said. ""I'll track you down inside. Right now, I'm everywhere at once.""

Elaine flashed him one last smile, linked arms with Keira, and stepped through the doors. The club swallowed them in a rush of pulsing lights, thumping bass, and glittering bodies—Studio 54 in all its decadent glory.

They threaded through the crush to the massive oval bar that wrapped the dance floor like a halo. Keira leaned in first, ordering a screwdriver for Elaine and a rum-and-coke for herself. The bartender—twenty-something, cheekbones sharp enough to cut glass—slid the drinks across with a slow, appreciative grin and a wink that lingered.

Glasses clinked. They sipped, then drifted to the floor's edge, letting the scene wash over them. They'd danced in plenty of clubs, but Studio 54 was a fever dream: strobes slicing the dark, bodies orbiting in sequined constellations, the air thick with perfume and possibility.

They plunged in.

Elaine and Keira moved in sync, hips rolling, drinks balanced on straws. A guy with a lion's mane of hair materialized beside Keira, leaning close to murmur something lost under the bass.

His hand settled low on her back, guiding her into a slow grind. She tossed back the last of her rum-and-coke, handed the empty glass to a passing tray, and looped her arms around his neck, drawing him so tight she might as well have been wearing him.

Elaine signaled the waitress for another drink and kept dancing. Overhead, a giant screen descended like a curtain call, Billy Idol snarling through White Wedding. The speakers thundered, the floor vibrated, and the night swallowed them whole.

Elaine spun around—no Keira, no lion. She shrugged, threaded back to the bar, and drained the fresh screwdriver in one sweet, electric gulp. Heaven. She signaled for another.

A twenty slid across the bar beside her.

""I've got this,"" a voice said.

The bartender lifted an eyebrow. ""For you, sir?""

""Scotch, rocks.""

The man turned to Elaine. ""I'm Doug."" He took her hand, warm and sure. ""That dress is lethal—you're killing it.""

The silver fabric clung to her like liquid mercury, stopping just above the knee, lifting and hugging every curve. Doug leaned in, cheek brushing hers, his breath warm against her ear as he spoke over the pounding music.

He laced his fingers through hers and led her back to the floor. Elaine raised her arms, palms open. Doug met them with his own, skin to skin, and they swayed—slow, deliberate, perfectly in time.

A waitress glided past. Doug flagged her down. ""Shot of scotch, shot of vodka."" She returned in seconds. He handed Elaine the vodka. They clinked, tilted, swallowed. Fire met ice, and the night burned brighter.

""Let's hit the balcony. Need a breather,"" Doug said, draping an arm over her shoulder and guiding her up the narrow stairs.

At the rail, he flagged a waitress. Two shots appeared—scotch for him, vodka for her. They clinked, swallowed, and sank onto low velvet theater seats. Doug stretched his arm along the backrest, fingers brushing her bare shoulder.

Below, the floor pulsed like a living thing; above, a massive screen flashed MTV in strobe-lit silence.

Elaine's head floated. She'd lost count after the third drink. Keira was surely gone—either dragging her lion back to Fort Lee or vanishing into his lair. They'd agreed on separate cabs if the night split them; practical, considering the haze.

""Best seat in the house,"" Doug murmured, nodding at the view.

She barely heard. Instead, she turned, cupped his face, and kissed him—slow, hungry, tasting smoke and scotch.

Minutes blurred. Then the room tilted, her limbs went liquid, and words slurred into nonsense.

Doug pulled back, eyes narrowing. ""Later,"" he muttered, and melted into the crowd.

Elaine's head lolled against the cushion. She closed her eyes—just a second—and the ceiling spun like a carousel. She'd partied hard before, but never this fast, this deep.

When the spinning sharpened, she forced her eyes open, gripped the rail, and staggered down the stairs, one careful step at a time.

She hit the main floor and sagged against a chrome pole, the room tilting like a ship in a storm. A voice cut through the haze.

""Elaine. Been hunting for you all night. You okay?""

She blinked up at Kenny, grinned wide, and spun a lazy finger in the air. ""Weeee...""

He barked a laugh. ""Yeah, you had a real good time. Too good."" He glanced toward the exit. ""Your girl's long gone—took off with some Teddy Boy. Come on, let's get you a cab.""

She looped an arm over his shoulder; he steadied her with a firm hand at the small of her back and steered her through the crowd. Outside, the night air slapped her awake. She tugged him close, lips brushing his ear, murmuring an invitation back to Fort Lee.

He wanted it—God, he did—but not like this. Their moment would come. Just not tonight.

Kenny hailed a yellow cab and eased her into the back seat.

""Poo,"" she pouted, patting the empty space beside her.

He handed the driver a twenty. ""Fort Lee. Make sure she gets inside safe.""

""No sweat, pal. I've hauled worse.""

Kenny leaned in for a quick goodnight. Elaine caught his mouth in a slow, sloppy kiss, tasting of vodka and gratitude.

""Thanks for taking care of me,"" she whispered.

The cab merged into traffic and vanished into the bright lights of Manhattan.

Kenny stood on the curb, touched two fingers to his lips, and smiled into the dark.
Another time. Just not tonight.

so this might come off as more than a rant but I just need opinions from people who have experienced something similar to me. 

So i [22F] have been dating my boyfriend [21M] for almost 3 years now and I just dont know if I love him anymore. Our relationship started off so amazing the way we met felt like everything was written in the stars. We use to go to high school together but never met, lived in the same neighborhood, and ended up at the same college. He would buy me our meals together, plan dates for us, was very respectful about my sensual trauma and let me have sex on my own terms, and didnt want me paying or anything and I genuinely felt worshiped and loved in my relationship. 

I guess the issues started at about the year mark but I was so infatuated by this man I kinda just excused everything. He started to complain and pout when we didn't have sex (even tho I told him I have a very low sex drive), started getting grumpier more often, and just started to take the things I did and my family did for advantage. 

My mom bought him his ticket and hotel stay at Vegas for my 21st, plus all of the food and activities, but never really thanked her for anything until I told him to. On top of that he never even attempted to offer to pay for anything (which my mom said she wouldn't have let him but would have appreciated the thought). He also looked miserable the entire trip and my whole family (mom, dad, and dad's girlfriend) commented on how he looked so disinterested in everything.

A few months after that me, my mom, and my pawpaw had to move to a larger place because after my pawpaw got sick and had to move in with us, our super small duplex just wasn't cutting it for a man with dementia, skin cancer, and a broken hip. 

Well about 2 weeks before we had to move my mom got super sick, she had an ovarian cyst and I was now tasked with taking on the entire move by myself. It was horrible. My mom keeps practically everything and out duplex was packed to the brim with heavy stuff to move and about a million boxes lol. I told my boyfriend about this complaining about how my back was killing me, I had reinjured my bad knee, and I had thrown out my shoulder from all of the heavy lifting. On top of this move my semester for college has just started so I had to try and do my engineering work as well. Not ONCE did he offer me any help until I broke down about 3 days before we had to be out and I still had a shit ton of stuff left to do and I begged him to help me. 

He works out he goes to the gym every day he would be able to handle all of this heavy lifting and moving more than I could. When he finally came over he kinda just stood there and waited for me to start something so he could take over and it pissed me off so much. My mom brought it up to me and told me how disrespectful it was that he not once tried to help me on his own and had to wait for me to have a mental breakdown, and again I excused his behavior. Told her some stupid shit like ""well hes also in school so hes been focusing on that"" and she just left it alone after that. 

A few months go by and its the same story, him complaing about me not having sex with him and he apologizing for it. He was taking me on less and less dates which was fine you know we were past the honeymoon phase. I was now working at the same job as him because it paid super well and I had the experience. 

I wanted to bring him gifts to work like coffee and blueberry muffins because I know how much he loves those and I thought he would appreciate the gesture, and I guess in a sense I thought if I did it for him maybe he would start to do it for me (stupid I know). But he never does and sometimes he would say thank you and just not touch anything i got him at all so I just stopped doing that completely because I found no point in it anymore. 

Cut to 3 months later and my mom brings up the idea of all of us going to flordia to go Disney with our family in flordia and she wants to invite my boyfriend. I thought that would be a great idea for him to meet more of my family and have a fun early summer trip. 

I bring it up to him and he says that sounds like fun but he needs to pay off his credit card so he's not sure he can make it. I tell my mom this and she said that he would only have to pay her 300 and he could do it in small increments until the trip came up. I told him that and he said yeah its perfect. My mom was going to surprise us with the money back after we landed so we could use that money as we pleased. I again I to tell him to tell her thank you because he didnt say it. And again the entire trip he looked grumpy, like he didnt want to be there, and was on his phone the whole time. 

Cut to now, we moved into our new apartment in July with another person and its been hell for me. The sex complaints are almost daily with him now getting snappy at me for it. He has barely done any house chores besides his own laundry, and I have to ask him to do other things like dishes. hes never vacuumed the house, and when im cleaning the whole apartment he sits on his ps5 for 5 hours and watches me clean until the last second and says he will help make the bed. Im in charge of the internet bill and our roommate is in charge of the electricity bill and every month we're supposed to send the money to each other. he has no issues sending my roommate her money but has only paid me for about half of the months we have been here. 

He's snapping at me for small things and only apologizes when I call him out on his tone, and the dates have stopped completely, we dont even have at home dates like ive suggested. I've been paying for all of our groceries for the past 2 months and he hasn't sent me a dime when ive begged him too. I talked to my roommate who said she's noticed he doesn't appreciate or respect me in the way I do to him, that she can see it from his mannerisms. 

Im so sorry this is so long but I dont know what to do. Im drafting up a paper to read to him to basically say if there's no change in behavior and treatment I'll have no choice but to walk away from the situation. But my only issue is rent. Me and my roommate can't afford this place alone. So what should I do?? ",1,1767118479.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

Diane stepped out of the elevator into the grand, spacious lobby of her midtown office, its ceiling adorned with vibrant murals of iconic capital cities.

Nick stood by the security desk, chatting with a sixty-something guard, likely about his beloved Rangers.""

Diane tried to steady her nerves. She was undeniably drawn to Nick—an educated, successful, handsome, and charming man. Being asked out by someone like him felt flattering, almost surreal.

When Nick spotted her, he cut his hockey talk short.

""I don't know what you did upstairs, but you look incredible.""

Diane blushed. ""Just a touch of blush and lipstick. Didn't want to look like I worked all day.""

""Well, I added some extra hair gel and cologne myself,"" Nick said with a grin. ""Wasn't gonna mention it, but since you did...""

They both laughed, the ice melting between them.

""Do you like seafood?"" Nick asked. ""There's a spot in the Village with killer surf and turf.""

""I'd love that,"" Diane said. ""Where I'm from, dinner out means Italian or Chinese. Seafood's a nice change.""

""Change can be good,"" Nick said with a smile. ""Come on, I'm parked across the street.""

The lot attendant spotted Nick, grinned, and darted to fetch his car. Moments later, he pulled around the corner in a sleek BMW 325e—the quintessential yuppie car, screaming ambition and polish. It suited Nick perfectly: successful, refined, and self-assured.

The attendant hopped out, and Nick slipped him a bill with a practiced ease. Diane noted it, impressed. Danny pulled off similar moves, but where Danny was rough like sandpaper, Nick was smooth as fine Egyptian cotton.

Nick drove downtown, weaving effortlessly through the city's bustling streets. New York hummed  with after-work crowds and tourists diving into the sights and shops.

He parked on Bleecker Street, right by The Clipper Seafood Bar. Darkness had settled in, but the restaurant's glowing neon lights cast a warm, inviting vibe.

Nick hurried around to open Diane's door, offering his hand. As she stepped out, her eyes locked onto his, searching, almost piercing. The urge to pull each other into a kiss hung between them, unspoken. Instead, they walked into the restaurant and were led to a cozy corner table in the back. 

Fishing poles and nets lined the walls, giving the place the cozy, lived-in feel of an old fishing boat.

""So, here we are,"" Nick said, easing into the conversation with a hint of awkwardness.

""Here we are,"" Diane replied, feeling a surge of confidence as his gaze made her feel desired.

""I spend a lot of time in the city,"" Nick said. ""Grew up in Manhasset, Long Island. My family's got a place in the Hamptons, right on the beach. Maybe you'll check it out this summer.""

He wasn't bragging, just being himself—open, genuine, the only way he knew how.

""Makes me wish it was summer already,"" Diane said. ""Do you still live on Long Island?""

""Nah,"" Nick said. ""My family does. After graduating Villanova and starting at Desmond and Johnson, I got an apartment on 79th and York. Feels like I'm in the heart of everything.""

""I'd love to live in the city someday,"" Diane admitted. ""Brooklyn's great, especially the people, but it's something I'd like to move on from eventually.""

""That's how I felt about Long Island,"" Nick said. ""Loved growing up there, but I needed to break free."" He paused, then added, ""I can see going back someday, though—once I meet the right woman, settle down, start a family.""

Diane smiled. ""That shouldn't be hard for you. You're a catch—handsome, successful, charming. I could fall for you in a heartbeat. But I need to be honest, for both our sakes. I'm still with my boyfriend. I don't know how long that'll last, but for now...""

""For now, let's be friends—at least, I hope we can be,"" Nick said, his tone earnest. ""But I need to be honest, too, for both our sakes. You're incredible, Diane. Your marketing skills are top-notch, and your future's bright. I hope this isn't too forward, but you're the most beautiful woman I've ever met. I felt that way the moment I saw you. So, let's order a great meal, kick back, and keep getting to know each other. Friends.""

Diane smiled. ""The surf and turf sounds perfect.""
Nick waved over the waiter. ""We'll both have the surf and turf, and a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon.""

""You're not making this easy, are you?"" Diane teased, her eyes playful.

""Can't say,"" Nick replied with a grin. ""Guess we'll see what happens.""

After dinner, Nick asked for the check, slipping his corporate card into the leather folder. When the waiter returned it, Nick tipped generously in cash—a practiced ritual, Diane noted.

""Let me drive you home,"" Nick offered.

""That's sweet, but I don't want to put you out,"" Diane said. ""I'll take the train.""

""Come on,"" Nick said. ""You've seen how I drive. I'll have you home and be back at my place in no time.""

She relented with a smile and slid into his car. When he pulled up to her house, they sat in silence for a moment.

""Well, this is me,"" Diane said, breaking the quiet.

""See you at work tomorrow,"" Nick said. ""Thanks for an amazing evening getting to know you.""

Diane hesitated, then leaned in slightly. ""I think you should kiss me goodnight, Nick. Otherwise, we'll both be up all night thinking about it, and I need some sleep.""

""Agreed,"" he said with a chuckle. ""Wouldn't want to dock you for being late.""

He leaned over, and their kiss was long, passionate, but stopped short of crossing a line that would've sent them back to his place.

They agreed to keep work and personal lives separate—for now. But as Nick had said over dinner, they'd start as friends and see where it led.

Chapter 22- Happy Birthday Debbie 

I strolled into the office that morning, ready to settle in. I set my two hefty loose-leaf binders—packed with essential cheat sheets—on my desk, propped one foot up (just one, per the collective bargaining agreement), and sipped my fresh-brewed deli coffee.

Stan arrived earlier than usual, dropping his briefcase—mostly stuffed with lunch and music trade magazines—onto his desk. He waved me over urgently.

I got up, hoping it wasn't work-related since we still had twenty minutes before the clock started.

""Gerry,"" Stan whispered, like he was sharing a state secret, ""it's Debbie's birthday today. She told me yesterday, so I asked her to dinner, and she said yes!"" His eyes gleamed with excitement.

""Okay,"" I said, unimpressed.

""No, you don't get it,"" he said. ""We were drinking wine.""

""And?"" I asked, skeptical.

Stan stared at me like I'd grown three heads. ""The restaurant was dimly lit. Candlelight. We were looking into each other's eyes.""

""And?"" I said again, waiting for a punchline I knew wasn't coming.

His eyes narrowed, frustration creeping in, one eyebrow arched. ""A violinist was wandering the restaurant. He stopped at our table and played a romantic Italian song just for us.""

I paused, letting it sink in. ""So, you treated Debbie to a nice birthday dinner, she gave you a friendly peck on the cheek, and you both went home alone."" I patted his back. ""You're a good friend, Stan.""

I glanced back as I returned to my desk. He sat there, staring straight ahead, biting the inside of his cheek.

Just then, Debbie breezed in. ""Good morning, guys!"" she said cheerfully.

""Morning,"" I said. ""Happy birthday!""

""Aw, thanks, Gerry!"" she said, flashing a smile and giving me the same friendly peck on the cheek Stan had gotten post-dinner.

I settled back at my desk, leaving Stan to stew in his thoughts.

Vinnie called Steve and me to join him at the eighth-floor wire panels. As first-wave digital technicians, we were green compared to veterans like Vinnie, who'd spent years mastering analog systems.

He studied a piece of engineering paper in his hand. The circuit he was troubleshooting was down hard—a critical line feeding the New York Stock Exchange's ticker, keeping brokers updated on trading quotes.

Vinnie suspected a broken wire right at the panel. Normally, we'd open a ticket for N-Tech to handle, but he saw a chance to teach Steve and me how these circuits were wired.

""Alright,"" Vinnie said, taking charge. ""We're getting on the floor under the panel. Steve, you're in the middle. Gerry, take the far end. I'll tug this wire. Steve, when you see it move, pull back so we know it's good up to there.""

Steve spotted a wire shifting and pulled it taut. ""Got it,"" he said.

""See?"" Vinnie said. ""We're good to that point. Gerry, you seeing any movement on your end?""

""Nothing, Vinnie,"" I said.

""Just as I thought,"" he said. ""Steve, now pull the wire toward Gerry's side.""

Steve complied as Vinnie traced the wiring between us. 

""There it is,"" Vinnie said, pointing. ""The wire's frayed right here."" He pulled a splicing tool from his pocket and deftly repaired it. I tugged from my side, and Steve confirmed he could see the movement.

""Good work, guys,"" Vinnie said. ""Think we got it.""

He called down to Sandy. ""Sand Man, check the circuit I left on my desk. Restored yet?""

""Clean and green, Vincent,"" Sandy replied. ""It's back up.""

""Nice job, gentlemen,"" Vinnie said. ""I'm sure the brokers are thrilled. I'll give them a call.""

We thanked Vinnie for the lesson. Learning something new was always a rush, and most of our seasoned mentors, like Vinnie, were eager to share their expertise—well, most of the time.

By the time we returned to our desks, it was almost break time. Vinnie had called the Stock Exchange to report the fix, then closed out his ticket. 

Turning to Steve and me, he grinned. ""You boys earned your keep today. Come join us in the alley.""

No way we'd turn down Vinnie's invite. The crew—Vinnie, Sandy, Dead, Steve, and I—headed to the alley, where Vinnie sparked up a joint.

It wasn't fat, but it didn't need to be. That was some quality weed. A couple of tokes each, and I was as mellow as a smooth jazz saxophonist.

Sandy, as usual when he's high, started giggling. I couldn't resist—grabbed him under the arms and tickled him. His giggles turned into full-on belly laughs, and soon we were all cracking up.

Back at our desks, we'd mostly pulled ourselves together. Not Sandy though. He was laughing so hard tears streamed down his face. 
""Freaking Gerry,"" he gasped between chuckles.

Vinnie smirked. ""I haven't seen him lose it like this since we saw Big Bamboo with Cheech and Chong.""

It wasn't until lunchtime that Sandy's laughter finally died down. He made me promise never to tickle him again. I swore I wouldn't, but I crossed my fingers behind my back—just in case.

I heard later that Ramy took Kenny and Pete up to N-Tech, just as Vinnie had done with Steve and me earlier. He'd pinpointed the issue to a faulty D4 channel card and offered to show them how to replace it.

During our afternoon break workout, I cornered Gary to get the scoop. He explained that he'd gotten the green light from the N-Tech manager to let us tag along and troubleshoot a few issues firsthand, so we could see what the job really entailed. Gary didn't just have our backs—he had all our sides covered.

When I got home that evening, I hopped straight into the shower. Mary called out that I didn't need to cook—she was craving stir-fried veggies and chicken in the wok her mom had given us as a housewarming gift.

She walked in just as I was toweling off. Without missing a beat, she started cooking, and soon the kitchen was filled with the mouthwatering aroma of sizzling vegetables and chicken.

We sat down to eat, and she set steaming plates in front of us. I took a bite and grinned.
""Hon, you've outdone yourself. This is absolutely delicious.""

""Thanks,"" she said with a smile. ""Just soy sauce and a little duck sauce magic.""

I leaned back, savoring the meal. ""So, Stan took Debbie out to dinner last night for her birthday. Not sure what's going on with that guy. Guess he wants to dance close to the flame without getting burned.""

Mary raised an eyebrow. ""Stan's married, right? That wouldn't fly with you. Does his wife know?""

""Nah,"" I said, shaking my head. ""Stan's just a frustrated crooner, stroking his ego now and then. Besides, Debbie's into girls.""

Mary gave a sarcastic chuckle. ""Oh, well, that makes it all fine then. But don't let me catch you out with Debbie—or any other girl, gay or straight. I'll stroke more than your ego—and you won't like it.""

""No worries, Tiger,"" I said, laughing. ""I checked my ego at the door the day I met you.""

Mary grinned, then her face lit up. ""Oh, I'm so happy Angie's back at work. She said she had a blast getting to know Jeff's folks. They're even planning to have us over to try some new kosher dishes Jeff's mom taught her.""

We kept the conversation flowing. I had her cracking up with the story of Sandy's uncontrollable giggles at work. After dinner, I cleared the table while she tackled the dishes.

We settled onto the couch, flipping on MTV for some music videos. I leaned in, kissing the back of her neck. 

""You know you're my one and only.""

She turned to me, her eyes sparkling with mischief. ""And you're mine. But I'm not making any promises if a hot gay guy starts working with me.""

I laughed, pulling her closer. ""Deal. As long as I get to watch you fend him off with that fiery charm of yours.""

We sank deeper into the cushions, the music filling the room as we traded playful jabs, content in our little world.

Chapter 23- First Of Many

Andre was getting ready for his first date with Linda. He showered, blow-dried his hair, and spritzed on the new cologne a coworker had sworn by.

He slipped into the light blue button-down shirt he'd picked up on 86th Street, paired with crisp dress pants. Studying his reflection, he gave himself one last once-over. He looked as sharp as he could manage. A deep breath later, he was ready.

It was Saturday night—the classic night for couples. Downstairs in the basement, his parents and sister were gathered around the dinner table.

""Let me look at you,"" his mom said warmly. ""Very handsome. If you weren't my son, I might just fall for you myself.""

""No tie?"" his dad asked, glancing up from his beef stew with a teasing grin.

""Nah, no tie,"" Andre replied. ""It's just dinner at New Corners. Don't want to come off too eager.""

His dad smirked. ""Maybe your mom and I will swing by incognito to check how your date's going.""

""Yeah, right,"" Andre laughed, heading for the door.

This time, the nerves weren't as sharp as they'd been when he'd taken Dean's cousin Elizabeth out. He already knew Linda. They'd met at Ernie Barry's, shared drinks, talked, even danced. Since then, there had been a few phone calls, enough to make this feel easy.

He hopped on the Belt Parkway toward Marine Park, where Linda lived with her mom,  just a few blocks from Mary's folks' house.

Upstairs, Linda slipped into a loose gray dress that fell just below her knees—comfortable, elegant, and perfectly her. She carried a few extra pounds and stood just shy of average height, but her warm smile and sparkling personality made her light up any room.

They probably wouldn't have met at all if Gerry hadn't practically pushed them together at Ernie Barry's. But from that first conversation, something had clicked.

Linda had planned a quiet night with Mary and their friends. Andre had figured it would be iced teas and going home alone. Fate—and Gerry's meddling—had other plans.

Andre pulled into the driveway, took a breath, and rang the doorbell.

""Hello! Come on in,"" greeted a plump, cheerful woman with Linda's same bright smile.

""I'm Linda's mom—Mary's Aunt Terry. I hear you're Gerry's pal.""

""Yes, I am,"" Andre replied, shaking her hand a little awkwardly. ""Gerry and I go way back.""

Just then, Linda came bounding down the stairs. ""I could hear you from my room and figured I'd better hustle down before Mom talks your ear off.""

""Nah, we were just getting started,"" Terry said with a laugh.

Linda looped her arm through Andre's, kissed her mom on the cheek, and said, ""Don't wait up, Ma. I'll see you in the morning.""

""Okay, I won't. Have fun, you two,"" Terry called. ""Andre, it was nice meeting you!""

""Same here. Hopefully, we'll chat more next time,"" Andre replied with a smile.

⸻

Andre parked across from New Corner in a diagonal spot—his go-to place for family dinners. He walked around to open Linda's door and offered his hand as she stepped down from the truck. Her fingers stayed wrapped around his as they crossed the street.

New Corner was family-owned, the warmth of it visible in every detail—framed family photos on the walls, soft lighting, and thick carpeting that made the place feel like home.

Gino greeted them with a smile and led them to a cozy table. Andre pulled out Linda's chair before sitting down.

""We've got three specials tonight,"" Gino said. ""Red snapper with buttery sauce, chicken Francese with potatoes and mixed vegetables, and prime rib with broccoli rabe. What can I get started for drinks?""

""I'll have a Budweiser,"" Andre said.

""Same for me,"" Linda added.

The busboy set down water and a basket of warm bread.

""I love your shirt, Andre,"" Linda said. ""You look so handsome.""

""Thanks,"" he replied, grinning. ""You're looking beautiful, as always—even if this is only our second time meeting.""

Linda laughed. ""Good one.""

She tapped the menu. ""I think I'll go with the tortellini Alfredo. I'm a sucker for Alfredo sauce.""

""I love it too,"" Andre said. ""But I never order it out. I make it at home—it's incredible. Restaurants can't compete.""

""Big talk!"" Linda teased. ""Guess I'll skip it tonight and hold you to making it for me sometime.""

Gino returned with their beers. Andre ordered two prime ribs with broccoli rabe, and Linda nodded her approval.

""You're quite the Renaissance man, Mr. Andre,"" Linda teased. ""Hunter, handyman, and now chef? I'm surprised some girl hasn't snatched you up.""

Andre chuckled. ""That's what everyone says—especially Gerry. Guess the right girl hasn't come along yet.""

Linda tilted her head, playful. ""Well, we'll see about that.""

Dinner arrived on a silver tray, the prime rib perfectly pink and juicy. Linda tried broccoli rabe for the first time—bitter at first, but by the end, she'd warmed to it.

""This feels like a wedding feast,"" Andre joked.

Linda laughed. ""The food, maybe. But I don't see a dance floor.""

Andre leaned back, satisfied. ""I'm stuffed.""

""I feel just right,"" Linda said. ""This meal did not disappoint.""

Andre met her gaze. ""Nothing about tonight has.""

""Mary invited us for a nightcap,"" Linda said. ""What do you think?""

""I'm too mellow for a club,"" Andre said with a grin. ""I'm in.""

Linda called Mary from the payphone up front. Andre paid the check while she waited.

""She says to come over,"" Linda said when she returned. ""They're watching an old movie Gerry rented from Blockbuster.""

They walked out hand in hand.

⸻

Andre parked in front of Gerry and Mary's apartment. The three-flight climb worked off a bit of dinner, though they were laughing and slightly breathless by the top.

Mary flung open the door. ""Come on in, you guys!""

Andre kissed her cheek. Gerry stood, hugging Linda.

""I picked up some B&B today,"" Gerry said with a grin. ""Figured you'd want your go-to.""

""Perfect,"" Andre replied.

Mary tugged Linda into the kitchen while Andre sank onto the couch.

""So?"" Mary asked. ""How was it?""

Linda's smile was soft, glowing. ""Oh, Mary, it was amazing. Better than amazing. I think I'm in love.""

In the living room, Gerry leaned toward Andre. ""Well?""

Andre's grin said everything. ""Best night of my life. I think I'm in love.""

Mary and Linda returned with the B&B and four cognac glasses. Gerry poured and raised his glass.

""To Andre and Linda's first date,"" he said warmly. ""May it be the first of many.""

Glasses clinked. The amber liquid caught the light, and the night felt like the start of something real.

Chapter 24- May December 

That same night, Big Kenny held court at Studio 54's velvet rope, his massive frame filling the doorway like a bouncer carved from granite.

Elaine and her friend Keira approached, and Kenny's stern face cracked into a grin. He pulled Elaine into a bear hug, then turned to Keira with the same easy warmth.

""Elaine! Glad you made it. The place is electric tonight—you two are in for a hell of a ride.""

""We wouldn't miss it,"" Elaine said, beaming. ""Kenny, meet Keira. She's my neighbor from the building.""

Keira, another forty-something divorcee, looked stunning in a backless black mini dress that hugged her curves and turned heads. ""I've dreamed of this place for years. Thank you so much for getting us in.""

""My pleasure,"" Kenny rumbled, squeezing Elaine's hand. ""Elaine and I are good friends. You ladies have a blast.""

""Will you join us for a drink later?"" Elaine asked, tilting her head.

""Count on it,"" Kenny said. ""I'll track you down inside. Right now, I'm everywhere at once.""

Elaine flashed him one last smile, linked arms with Keira, and stepped through the doors. The club swallowed them in a rush of pulsing lights, thumping bass, and glittering bodies—Studio 54 in all its decadent glory.

They threaded through the crush to the massive oval bar that wrapped the dance floor like a halo. Keira leaned in first, ordering a screwdriver for Elaine and a rum-and-coke for herself. The bartender—twenty-something, cheekbones sharp enough to cut glass—slid the drinks across with a slow, appreciative grin and a wink that lingered.

Glasses clinked. They sipped, then drifted to the floor's edge, letting the scene wash over them. They'd danced in plenty of clubs, but Studio 54 was a fever dream: strobes slicing the dark, bodies orbiting in sequined constellations, the air thick with perfume and possibility.

They plunged in.

Elaine and Keira moved in sync, hips rolling, drinks balanced on straws. A guy with a lion's mane of hair materialized beside Keira, leaning close to murmur something lost under the bass.

His hand settled low on her back, guiding her into a slow grind. She tossed back the last of her rum-and-coke, handed the empty glass to a passing tray, and looped her arms around his neck, drawing him so tight she might as well have been wearing him.

Elaine signaled the waitress for another drink and kept dancing. Overhead, a giant screen descended like a curtain call, Billy Idol snarling through White Wedding. The speakers thundered, the floor vibrated, and the night swallowed them whole.

Elaine spun around—no Keira, no lion. She shrugged, threaded back to the bar, and drained the fresh screwdriver in one sweet, electric gulp. Heaven. She signaled for another.

A twenty slid across the bar beside her.

""I've got this,"" a voice said.

The bartender lifted an eyebrow. ""For you, sir?""

""Scotch, rocks.""

The man turned to Elaine. ""I'm Doug."" He took her hand, warm and sure. ""That dress is lethal—you're killing it.""

The silver fabric clung to her like liquid mercury, stopping just above the knee, lifting and hugging every curve. Doug leaned in, cheek brushing hers, his breath warm against her ear as he spoke over the pounding music.

He laced his fingers through hers and led her back to the floor. Elaine raised her arms, palms open. Doug met them with his own, skin to skin, and they swayed—slow, deliberate, perfectly in time.

A waitress glided past. Doug flagged her down. ""Shot of scotch, shot of vodka."" She returned in seconds. He handed Elaine the vodka. They clinked, tilted, swallowed. Fire met ice, and the night burned brighter.

""Let's hit the balcony. Need a breather,"" Doug said, draping an arm over her shoulder and guiding her up the narrow stairs.

At the rail, he flagged a waitress. Two shots appeared—scotch for him, vodka for her. They clinked, swallowed, and sank onto low velvet theater seats. Doug stretched his arm along the backrest, fingers brushing her bare shoulder.

Below, the floor pulsed like a living thing; above, a massive screen flashed MTV in strobe-lit silence.

Elaine's head floated. She'd lost count after the third drink. Keira was surely gone—either dragging her lion back to Fort Lee or vanishing into his lair. They'd agreed on separate cabs if the night split them; practical, considering the haze.

""Best seat in the house,"" Doug murmured, nodding at the view.

She barely heard. Instead, she turned, cupped his face, and kissed him—slow, hungry, tasting smoke and scotch.

Minutes blurred. Then the room tilted, her limbs went liquid, and words slurred into nonsense.

Doug pulled back, eyes narrowing. ""Later,"" he muttered, and melted into the crowd.

Elaine's head lolled against the cushion. She closed her eyes—just a second—and the ceiling spun like a carousel. She'd partied hard before, but never this fast, this deep.

When the spinning sharpened, she forced her eyes open, gripped the rail, and staggered down the stairs, one careful step at a time.

She hit the main floor and sagged against a chrome pole, the room tilting like a ship in a storm. A voice cut through the haze.

""Elaine. Been hunting for you all night. You okay?""

She blinked up at Kenny, grinned wide, and spun a lazy finger in the air. ""Weeee...""

He barked a laugh. ""Yeah, you had a real good time. Too good."" He glanced toward the exit. ""Your girl's long gone—took off with some Teddy Boy. Come on, let's get you a cab.""

She looped an arm over his shoulder; he steadied her with a firm hand at the small of her back and steered her through the crowd. Outside, the night air slapped her awake. She tugged him close, lips brushing his ear, murmuring an invitation back to Fort Lee.

He wanted it—God, he did—but not like this. Their moment would come. Just not tonight.

Kenny hailed a yellow cab and eased her into the back seat.

""Poo,"" she pouted, patting the empty space beside her.

He handed the driver a twenty. ""Fort Lee. Make sure she gets inside safe.""

""No sweat, pal. I've hauled worse.""

Kenny leaned in for a quick goodnight. Elaine caught his mouth in a slow, sloppy kiss, tasting of vodka and gratitude.

""Thanks for taking care of me,"" she whispered.

The cab merged into traffic and vanished into the bright lights of Manhattan.

Kenny stood on the curb, touched two fingers to his lips, and smiled into the dark.
Another time. Just not tonight.

# Mastering the Pour Over: Your Daily Ritual, Elevated

Tired of bitter, bland coffee? The humble pour over brewer might be your key to unlocking a world of nuanced flavor, transforming your morning cup into a delightful ritual. It’s a hands-on approach that grants you unparalleled control over extraction, allowing the true character of your beans to shine through.

Unlike automatic drip machines, the pour over method invites you to participate. You control the water temperature, the pour rate, and the bloom time, all of which directly impact the final taste. This level of engagement means you can fine-tune your brew, coaxing out delicate floral notes or rich chocolate undertones that might otherwise be lost.

*   **Unmatched Flavor Control:** Adjust variables like water flow and temperature to highlight specific tasting notes in your coffee.
*   **Simple Yet Sophisticated:** The brewer itself is uncomplicated, but the technique allows for endless refinement and mastery.
*   **A Moment of Mindfulness:** The deliberate process provides a calming start to your day, a brief escape into the art of coffee making.

Ready to taste the difference precision makes? Explore our curated selection of pour over brewers and start your journey to a better cup today.

1pzp7od,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenOver40/comments/1pzp7od/i_am_so_tired_of_taking_care_of_other_people/,I am so tired of taking care of other people.,"I’ve had a cold for about a month and a half. My husband works all the time. He makes very good money but he works a lot. I stay home (despite having a graduate degree) because we have 6 kids and he can’t take time off for sick kid days or for IEP meetings or to ferry kids to doctor’s appointments. My job is home.

So anyway, I pick one of our college kids up from his dorm for winter break and he’s positive for COVID. So I get Covid. This is coming off the heels of another upper respiratory infection I had just gotten over from kid germs at Thanksgiving. I feel like shit. Life still goes on, kids still need to get to the bus stop, house still needs cleaned, etc

Then a week later I hosted Christmas for my family, which I wanted to do. Probably 15 people and it was a dream to have all of my family at my home for Christmas (because of my husbands choice in job locations this is the first time we have been within driving distance from them in a very long time). But it was so much work. Coordinating the food and shopping for presents for extended family and wrapping all the presents, all alone bc he’s working. Cleaning up after people. Arranging sleeping quarters. Entertaining people. Being “on” so everyone has a magical Christmas. All while still not ever fully recovering from Covid bc I haven’t been able to slow down and rest. He worked overnight Christmas Eve so I was “Santa”, alone.

I was so, so tired. My mom did help by watching the smaller kids in the morning so I could try to sleep.  But then she and my college kid would get into arguments over politics and religion and I had to deal with that shit show. Oh and my husbands brother also visited even though my husband was working the whole time. So I was worried about him being bored and feeling left out the whole time.

Then we went on a ski trip because he finally had a week off week after Christmas, which again I wanted to do. I want my kids to grow up being able to do neat things that I was never able to do and it’s hard with the kid school schedules. So I arranged it all for me, husband and 6 kids. Booked everything. If I don’t arrange it then it won’t get done and that only hurts the kids. Lift tickets, ski school, lodging. He did get the ski clothes out of the garage and help pack. But I did everything else. Shopping for food for snacks, making sure we had a thermometer and kids ibuprofen just in case, managing the payments and itinerary and so on.

So now we are here and I want to fucking explode. We were out the door first thing this morning to get to the rental shop before ski school opened and that was a hot mess. (I hate cold, by the way, and I hate skiing but I’m doing this because the kids love skiing and I thought I’d have a couple of days to sit around and read and knit while they were on the slopes.)

Meanwhile, my husband seems to have regressed to a small child. My 10 year old gets his gear and just disappears while I’m getting another kid checked in to ski school. So I say to husband “Hey, 10 year old just ran off to the ski lift, can you go look for him as the ski lift is unloading so we can find him.” He legit looked at me and said “I don’t know what a ski lift is. I’ve never been skiing.” I swear to God I almost combusted. This man has a DOCTORATE. No, he’s never been skiing because his family also didn’t grow up doing these things but he has absolutely taken the kids to ski lessons before in another town and he’s not an idiot. And at a bare minimum, he knows how to use Google so maybe Google it if you really don’t know!

So then I find myself taking my 40+ year old grown husband out to the lift and going “This is a ski lift, it has motorized chairs that take people up and down the mountain”, like I am talking to someone who was raised by wolves and has never seen civilization before. Husband has a headache. I said “Why don’t you get some coffee for the caffeine?” He goes “There’s no coffee here.” I say “There’s a coffee shop down there a few buildings down.” He says “I don’t know where that is.” IDK, WHY DON’T YOU LOOK ON THE MAP THAT IS RIGHT THERE ON THE TABLE?!???

We finally get everyone sorted. Get husband his lift ticket and lesson pass. Make sure he knows what time he has to be there and that he has to go to rental shop an hour early. (10 year old was found and scolded for rushing off by the way) Finally, FINALLY I can relax and knit and read my nice fantasy romance I picked out for this trip. NOPE! Guess what never made it into the car? My knitting and my book. I don’t know if I had a brain lapse while getting everything else together or what but it’s not here.

I just went in the bedroom and cried. I’m so tired of taking care of everyone else. I just want someone to take care of me for once in a while. Or even to just be responsible for taking care of only myself. I just need to tell someone who will listen. I’m tired.",4,1767118212.0,WomenOver40,1,1.0,False

For context, I've been on Mounjaro this year with excellent results. I'm back in the gym 5 days a week and eating less. The medication slows my metabolism, so alcohol doesn't even give me a buzz anymore; it's just completely empty calories at this point.

Also, I'm not even fully committed to the resolution; who actually keeps their's past the springtime anyways?

His reaction feels disproportionate and I'm trying to understand what's really going on here.This feels less about the alcohol and more about control (and super immature).

1pzp4k3,https://v.redd.it/jolheul4tdag1,The Cup - I accidentally discovered something my Otos love.,"Like many others here, I became obsessed with making sure my new Otos were eating enough. They ignored algae wafers and blanched zucchini and I was concerned on how to supplement their diet.  

I noticed that they really like a  porcelain dragon in my tank, but it’s small and they consume the biofilm on it quickly. So I decided to increase the porcelain surface area in my tank by adding a coffee mug. Holy cow!  It has been a game changer. 

First, they love the cup. This is their favorite spot and they are obsessed with it. 

Second, it’s perfect for placing their food supplement right inside the cup. I dropped an algae wafer in there and it stays contained in the cup and is easy to clean and remove. (I don’t know if they are actually eating the wafer yet, but I do feel like they can’t ignore it as they are in and out of this cup constantly. )

Third, I also give them Bacter AE every few days. I mix up a toothpick’s worth of the powder in a bowl with a little tank water and then I use a medical syringe to place the solution right into the cup. It concentrates at the bottom and along the sides of the cup and they feast. 

So the cup, has been a win win in my tank and it belongs to the fish gods now.

Fillings from left to right:
Peach Jam
Vanilla pastry cream
100% dark Chocolate coffee pastry cream

To make the chocolate pastry cream, I just added about 100g of dark chocolate powder with 40g of freshly brewed espresso and mixed it in with the pastry cream before heating. Makes it thicker and richer than normal pastry cream which I personally prefer. No clue if it has a name as itself though. 

My other change is purely the type of yeast I used. I let my yeast wake up before adding it to the flour, but that's about it. Everything else is as it :)

I’m not great at Reddit formatting, so please forgive me it ends up looking ugly

\### Trans Masc Vocal Exercises:

(Piano app required- hit the note on the app to match your voice to the notes)

\# Step 1: Vocal Function Exercises

1. Say ""O"" at the highest you can sliding down to the lowest you can and the opposite (from

lowest you can to highest you can)

3. Starting with B3, hum the note and transition into ""O"" with rounded lips (like 'old' without the d) and sustain for 5 sec. Repeat this for descending notes B3-A3

\- Do each exercise twice, two times a day (morning and evening)

\# Step 2- Darkening Voice

1. Practice \*opening vocal folds\* by yawning. Then do a mild, non-visible yawn with lips

closed, holding the throat open at the end of the yawn, and chanting ""moo moo moo"" (suggested start E3)

2. Practice \*elongating vocal tract\* by rounding the lips: repeat the same word (ideally one starting with E or A, like ""easy"" or ""eighty-one"") on the same note (again, start with E3), first with lips spread (like a smile) then rounded. Repeat word 3x wide & 3x open for 3 reps (total repeat of word 9x open and 9x rounded)

3. Work on \*intonation\* by repeating phrases where you might naturally have an upwards

inflection at the end of sentence (""would you like a coffee?"") And mindfully keeping it flat

or deeper instead of inflecting up

\# Step 3: Resonance & Vocal Weight

Do these exercises at C3 or lower if you've been on T for a while and can hit lower registers. Use D# or higher if you are not on

1. \*Resonance - changing throat shape:\* practice saying vowel sounds (E/A/O) at the same note, but starting bright then progressively darkening the sound through neutral then dark sounds by rounding the lips slightly more and opening the throat more with each drop.

Repeat 3x

2. Once you've found a comfortably dark resonance with the vowel(s), start saying words after the vowel, \*maintaining pitch and resonance\*. (Ex: “oooh. Bluuue. Monday Tuesday Wednesday).

3. \*Volume for vocal weight\*: again pick an appropriate note and hum to match pitch.

Maintaining pitch, softly count to 3. Then match pitch with a hum again, and while putting more power behind it, count to 3 again.

Do not try to combine multiple vocal aspects (ie altered resonance \*and\* vocal weight together) until you have mastered and feel comfortable with each adjustment individually.

Hope this helps 🥰

So here we go i will just start and try to griup things together

So im 16m no school and i go to a place to get a rythm and eventually go back to school or work im there on monday and friday from 9-12 and wednsday 9-15 i and i have meds citalopram iirc been on them for idk more then a year i gues

Now i dont have any irl friends only a group online which i game with for the past 4 ish years and i like it but idk i still feel lonely then at the place there came this guy and we became friends went to his place once etc but we dont see each other much irl besides the location since he lives a town over but we still do have fecent ammount of contact online

Now there was also this trans guy 17 which came in after summer vacation and we had a nice click and he asked if i maybe wanted to do something irl i said sure and we did we were at my place from 1pm till 11pm mentioned to me he mentionef if you want we could do something tommorow got fries watched a movie talked scrolled weird fetish sub reddits we could talk about EVERYTHING if u catch my drift Next day i asked him around 2pm i fell asleep had a missed deleted messagr when i wokr up at 6pm i sended ? He said he was out with his sister

Now that was on a friday i think 10th of november? But next monday i went bald idk why i was bored and tought it will grow back anyway so i sended a pic of my bald head and a joke to see how far i could go bad tendency i have im really ashamed but it may have been me bald with a random text wanna be fwb and only after i texted it i started realising how many wrong ways this could have been picked up i texted sorry shouldnt yave done that bad tendency he asked what is fwb i explained he said hahaha and to see if i was still in the safe zone i stupidly asked but if youre up for it he said what i said fuck..... and he mentioned he didnt feel comfortable and i know this is completeley on ME But afylter that i was stupidlt sending a lot of text asking if it was ok etc he said it was but i couldnt leave it so i asked multiple times which was stupid a aplogised for that and i still couldbt leave it but managed to stop texting this was 1-2 weeks after the incident iirc then i sended a message saying really sorry what happend hope u dont think differently of me and if u want to do something again sometime just let me know if not its totally fine He didnt read it so me and my stupid ass resend it multiple times and delete the old ones

Now people reading trust me i meant this as a joke im not stupid enough to ruin a possible friendship over wanna being fwb which i didnt want to but ad seen before im not that stupid but quite stupid

Anyway he was only on the location there on wendsday 12-15 and he didnt always shoe up since he found it difficult first week didnt show 2nd week didnt show vut the councelor did come to me and said he told me you made a jokr that didnt land good burlt he wasnt feeling great and might have been fine with otherwise And he said if i could tell you (me) that he really likrd thr contact here at the place but that outsidr of herr is too much rn

Later that day home i semt the councelor if he could say back i totally understand and if he wanted to do anything ever again he could jus text and if not also fine he said the first part to him but said that i should text the 2nd part myself So i texted it he didnt read it after a week and i jist deleted thr chat history and let it be now i havent seen him since 10th of november nor will since he turned 18 this december and once ur 18 u need to go so that was it but i sometimes still think was it my fault or was that geniunly too much for him like mentally etc

And i just think about it sometimes and think fuck wad it my fault or no But on the other hand im only 16 people come and go And ik the part above all mistakes were MY mistakes no need to mention that

Now that turned out longer then i expected so sorry for that but i dont think thats a major cause for how im feeling but i just wanted it to be added maybe just a star in the unicersenof how im feeling

But back to now its christmas break and have been feeling horrid for weeks now and idk why and it has never been this long and sleep schedule is fucked af And like i dont think im really worth anything there is a 60% id press a button that would kill me and nade everyone i know forget me maybe even a higherb chance now like whats my life worth laying in bed gaming and jerking off well what a life im living And idk what to do with it I also hsd somr certain toughts if u catch my drift mentiomed it to both my mom and councelor snd were look for therappy now But i just dont know what to do with it i feel absolutely missareble

And 2 more things I feel like im not allowed to feel better like when i feel a tad bit better and then gets worse again i feel like im not allowed to feel beter And talked with the councelor about this she said sje knows what i mean she has had a depression and burnout a few years back and she siad maybe thats because this is ur new normal now or feels like my new normal

And i feel like im subconsiously making myself feel this way? Because when i have short sudden spikes i feel better and then crash into oblivion again i think but i can still feel better which makes me think im subconsciously making myself feel this way eventough i dont think i am

and sometimes eventough im laughinh like i went to the neighbors with my dad we have a good relation with them my dad does things for them like laying new floor boards hanging tv etc and we just drank some coffee it was decent and i did feel a bit better but i still felt bad inside

and at the location i go to there is a girl 16 i mean were fine with each other play some pool usually etc but she goes out gets drunk etc and im like damn id like to expiernce it but i cant so to speak for lack of a better word

So here we go i will just start and try to griup things together

So im 16m no school and i go to a place to get a rythm and eventually go back to school or work im there on monday and friday from 9-12 and wednsday 9-15 i and i have meds citalopram iirc been on them for idk more then a year i gues

Now i dont have any irl friends only a group online which i game with for the past 4 ish years and i like it but idk i still feel lonely then at the place there came this guy and we became friends went to his place once etc but we dont see each other much irl besides the location since he lives a town over but we still do have fecent ammount of contact online

Now there was also this trans guy 17 which came in after summer vacation and we had a nice click and he asked if i maybe wanted to do something irl i said sure and we did we were at my place from 1pm till 11pm mentioned to me he mentionef if you want we could do something tommorow got fries watched a movie talked scrolled weird fetish sub reddits we could talk about EVERYTHING if u catch my drift Next day i asked him around 2pm i fell asleep had a missed deleted messagr when i wokr up at 6pm i sended ? He said he was out with his sister

Now that was on a friday i think 10th of november? But next monday i went bald idk why i was bored and tought it will grow back anyway so i sended a pic of my bald head and a joke to see how far i could go bad tendency i have im really ashamed but it may have been me bald with a random text wanna be fwb and only after i texted it i started realising how many wrong ways this could have been picked up i texted sorry shouldnt yave done that bad tendency he asked what is fwb i explained he said hahaha and to see if i was still in the safe zone i stupidly asked but if youre up for it he said what i said fuck..... and he mentioned he didnt feel comfortable and i know this is completeley on ME But afylter that i was stupidlt sending a lot of text asking if it was ok etc he said it was but i couldnt leave it so i asked multiple times which was stupid a aplogised for that and i still couldbt leave it but managed to stop texting this was 1-2 weeks after the incident iirc then i sended a message saying really sorry what happend hope u dont think differently of me and if u want to do something again sometime just let me know if not its totally fine He didnt read it so me and my stupid ass resend it multiple times and delete the old ones

Now people reading trust me i meant this as a joke im not stupid enough to ruin a possible friendship over wanna being fwb which i didnt want to but ad seen before im not that stupid but quite stupid

Anyway he was only on the location there on wendsday 12-15 and he didnt always shoe up since he found it difficult first week didnt show 2nd week didnt show vut the councelor did come to me and said he told me you made a jokr that didnt land good burlt he wasnt feeling great and might have been fine with otherwise And he said if i could tell you (me) that he really likrd thr contact here at the place but that outsidr of herr is too much rn

Later that day home i semt the councelor if he could say back i totally understand and if he wanted to do anything ever again he could jus text and if not also fine he said the first part to him but said that i should text the 2nd part myself So i texted it he didnt read it after a week and i jist deleted thr chat history and let it be now i havent seen him since 10th of november nor will since he turned 18 this december and once ur 18 u need to go so that was it but i sometimes still think was it my fault or was that geniunly too much for him like mentally etc

And i just think about it sometimes and think fuck wad it my fault or no But on the other hand im only 16 people come and go And ik the part above all mistakes were MY mistakes no need to mention that

Now that turned out longer then i expected so sorry for that but i dont think thats a major cause for how im feeling but i just wanted it to be added maybe just a star in the unicersenof how im feeling

But back to now its christmas break and have been feeling horrid for weeks now and idk why and it has never been this long and sleep schedule is fucked af And like i dont think im really worth anything there is a 60% id press a button that would kill me and nade everyone i know forget me maybe even a higherb chance now like whats my life worth laying in bed gaming and jerking off well what a life im living And idk what to do with it I also hsd somr certain toughts if u catch my drift mentiomed it to both my mom and councelor snd were look for therappy now But i just dont know what to do with it i feel absolutely missareble

And 2 more things I feel like im not allowed to feel better like when i feel a tad bit better and then gets worse again i feel like im not allowed to feel beter And talked with the councelor about this she said sje knows what i mean she has had a depression and burnout a few years back and she siad maybe thats because this is ur new normal now or feels like my new normal

And i feel like im subconsiously making myself feel this way? Because when i have short sudden spikes i feel better and then crash into oblivion again i think but i can still feel better which makes me think im subconsciously making myself feel this way eventough i dont think i am

and sometimes eventough im laughinh like i went to the neighbors with my dad we have a good relation with them my dad does things for them like laying new floor boards hanging tv etc and we just drank some coffee it was decent and i did feel a bit better but i still felt bad inside

and at the location i go to there is a girl 16 i mean were fine with each other play some pool usually etc but she goes out gets drunk etc and im like damn id like to expiernce it but i cant so to speak for lack of a better word

maybe if i just take my eyes out, it wouldn’t hurt as much to look at people and things who are not you.
i could just donate them to those who need them and live my life with the sense of smell, hearing, and touch.
i could ignore the fact that i am hearing people who are not you.
but what if I can’t? what if the sound of laughter only sound like raindrops pitter-pattering on the roof, like wind-chimes, like songbirds when they come from you?
so i will take out my ears too, i can live with smell, touch, and taste alone.
i will grow to love the smell of incense, lavender diffusers, and petrichor. 
but I yearn to daydream of your natural scent, the one i used to keep sniffing on myself like a dog lovingly welcoming her friend from work. i welcomed your scent on me, however musky and lingering and loved those parts about them.
i yearn to daydream how it smelled after we made love, because living it seems so out of touch with reality that I believe I am going insane over obsessing over you.
but hey, olfactory senses can go fuck themselves. we will stick with touch and taste.
maybe i will stick with loving the way it feels to hug my mom, to pet my dog or any dog or any cat.
but i can’t forget the way your lips felt on mine, the way you’d clasp my waist like death is closing in on us, or the way you’d kiss my forehead. i can’t forget the way your hug felt like they could protect me from atom bombs.
how the fuck can i get rid of my sense of touch? And let’s say I do get rid of them. I can grow to be fine with the way water tastes on my lips after dehydrating myself way too much, the way hot soup tastes or the way coffee tastes. but how can i forget the taste of your lips? nor do i want to. nor do i want to forget how you look, the sound of your laughter, your natural scent, the way your hands would linger on mine a little while longer, or the taste of your lips. it would kill me to.
So I will just strip myself down. Take out all my senses and in essence, take me out. I would neither have a mouth to scream out my pain nor eyes to cry them out. I would be devoid of hugs to please me, of roses on my death bed to convince me to stay. It would have been better to die with the taste of your lips lingering on mine yet here I lay waiting for it all to end. ",3,1767117738.0,UnsentTexts,2,0.8,False

I’m not great at Reddit formatting, so please forgive me it ends up looking ugly

\###Trans Masc Vocal Exercises

(Piano app required- hit the note on the app to match your voice to the notes)

\#Step 1: Vocal Function Exercises

1. Say ""O"" at the highest you can sliding down to the lowest you can and the opposite (from

lowest you can to highest you can)

3. Starting with B3, hum the note and transition into ""O"" with rounded lips (like 'old' without the d) and sustain for 5 sec. Repeat this for descending notes B3-A3

\- Do each exercise twice, two times a day (morning and evening)

\#Step 2- Darkening Voice

1. Practice \*opening vocal folds\* by yawning. Then do a mild, non-visible yawn with lips

closed, holding the throat open at the end of the yawn, and chanting ""moo moo moo"" (suggested start E3)

2. Practice \*elongating vocal tract\* by rounding the lips: repeat the same word (ideally one starting with E or A, like ""easy"" or ""eighty-one"") on the same note (again, start with E3), first with lips spread (like a smile) then rounded. Repeat word 3x wide & 3x open for 3 reps (total repeat of word 9x open and 9x rounded)

3. Work on \*intonation\* by repeating phrases where you might naturally have an upwards

inflection at the end of sentence (""would you like a coffee?"") And mindfully keeping it flat

or deeper instead of inflecting up

\#Step 3: Resonance & Vocal Weight

Do these exercises at C3 or lower if you've been on T for a while and can hit lower registers. Use D# or higher if you are not on

1. Resonance - changing throat shape

. P

1. ractice saying vowel sounds (E/A/O) at the same note, but starting bright then progressively darkening the sound through neutral then dark sounds by rounding the lips slightly more and opening the throat more with each drop.

Repeat 3x

2. Once you've found a comfortably dark resonance with the vowel(s), start saying words after the vowel, \*maintaining pitch and resonance\*. (Ex: “oooh. Bluuue. Monday Tuesday Wednesday).

3. \*Volume for vocal weight\*: again pick an appropriate note and hum to match pitch.

Maintaining pitch, softly count to 3. Then match pitch with a hum again, and while putting more power behind it, count to 3 again.

Do not try to combine multiple vocal aspects (ie altered resonance \*and\* vocal weight together) until you have mastered and feel comfortable with each adjustment individually.

There are 5 windows along the outside. The only wall without anything interrupting it is the one with the tv stand on it. The bottom of the picture is a railing with an opening and a tiny spec of wall in the corner. I did not measure the railing/opening width, fireplace, windows, or tv console, but made a good estimate. The dimensions of the room are correct. The ceiling is vaulted with it being  highest in the right third of the photo. 

I have been using this room planer to figure out how to organize this space and what furniture to buy but I am at a loss. The only furniture I have to have in the space is the tv stand. I also have a cat tower, end tables, floor lamps, and a coffee table but those can go other places in my house if needed. The tv can go above the fireplace mantel, but I’m worried it would be too high since the room is so narrow.

1pzovn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1pzovn4/how_to_turn_awkward_into_attractive/,How to Turn Awkward Into Attractive,"# **How to turn awkward into attractive: the non-cringe glow-up guide they won’t teach you**

So many people are walking around thinking they're ""awkward"" and that it's some fixed trait. Like it's written into their DNA. But here's the thing no one with a ring light will tell you on TikTok: awkwardness is not personality. It’s untrained social muscle, underexposed confidence, and often, misunderstood signals.  

This post is for anyone who’s ever overanalyzed a convo for 3 days straight, avoided eye contact at parties, or replayed a weird laugh in their head 100 times. It’s not your fault. We live in a world where real social skills have been replaced with curated IG stories and half-baked charisma hacks that don’t teach actual connection.  

So here’s what years of reading, observing, and diving deep into behavioral science, podcast convos, and social psych books say about how people go from “awkward” to effortlessly magnetic. These tips are research-backed, field-tested, and actually work.  

Take what clicks and forget the rest.

---

* **Stop labeling yourself as awkward, start labeling your patterns**
  * Social psychologist Dr. Amy Cuddy (author of *Presence*) says we often internalize identity based on temporary experiences. Calling yourself “awkward” reinforces that as your default. Instead…
    * Reframe it: “I sometimes feel awkward in new social settings” gives your mind space to adapt and grow.
    * The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology showed that simply changing self-talk improves confidence and reduces anxiety in conversations.

* **Learn the micro-skills that make people like you instantly**
  * According to Vanessa Van Edwards (*The Science of People*), charismatic people aren’t born, they just stack small behaviors that build trust.
    * *Use the triple nod.* Research from the University of Tokyo found that people listening while nodding slowly three times triggered more openness from others.
    * *Match tone, not words.* Mirroring speech speed and vocal tone (not mimicking) signals similarity, which builds rapport fast.
    * *Keep your hands visible.* Harvard’s Social Cognition Lab found that when people talk with visible hands, others rate them as more trustworthy.

* **Practice “low-stakes exposure” to awkwardness**
  * If you're socially anxious, don’t start by volunteering to give a TED Talk. Use what psychologist Dr. Ellen Hendriksen (author of *How to Be Yourself*) calls low-stakes exposure:
    * Ask someone at the coffee shop how their day’s going.
    * Make one comment a day in your group chat.
    * Say “hi” to the dog owners at the park.
  * This builds desensitization. Over time, your brain learns that social discomfort isn’t danger.

* **Don’t try to “be interesting.” Instead, be interested**
  * In *Captivate*, Vanessa Van Edwards highlights that trying to impress makes you more awkward. But showing genuine curiosity in others makes you magnetic.
    * Ask open-ended questions like “What’s something that made you laugh this week?”
    * Use active listening cues: tilt head, slight smile, repeat part of what they said.
  * A 2021 study by Harvard researchers showed that people who ask follow-up questions are consistently rated more likable and warm.

* **Use “pre-framing” to diffuse your inner critic**
  * From the *Hidden Brain* podcast, Shankar Vedantam explores how pre-framing your own awkwardness — without making it self-deprecating — removes tension:
    * Say something like “I always say weird stuff when I’m nervous, so congrats, you’re officially interesting to me.”
    * It resets expectations and makes both people relax.

* **Do “charisma reps” — not just gym reps**
  * Think of social confidence like a skill. Books like *Atomic Habits* by James Clear prove that small regular actions compound.
    * Set a goal: 3 authentic compliments or questions per day.
    * Track the reps in your notes app. Watch how the momentum builds.
  * According to a study published by the British Psychological Society, incrementally increasing social interactions measurably boosts both confidence and perceived attractiveness.

* **Work on your vibe, not just your words**
  * According to Dr. Albert Mehrabian's classic communication research, 93% of impact comes from nonverbal cues.
    * Your vibe → facial elasticity, vocal warmth, relaxed posture.
    * You don’t need to say clever things. You need to *feel safe in your own presence*, so others do too.

* **Ditch the performative advice — own your version of charismatic**
  * Charisma isn’t loud. Some of the most magnetic people are quietly confident. The *You Made a Weird Face* panic comes from trying to perform personality.
    * Use what podcaster Mark Manson calls “strategic vulnerability.” Being real about your quirks (without fishing for validation) is disarming.
    * Internal script: “They don’t need perfect. They need present.”

---

Being awkward isn’t your identity. It’s a message your nervous system sends when it feels unsafe or unsure. But with practice, exposure, and small reframes, that same brain can mold you into someone who is not just socially fluent — but seriously attractive.

And attractive doesn’t mean hot or loud. It means authentic, self-aware, and easy to be around.

Let the internet keep yelling charisma “hacks.” Study the real stuff. It works better, and you won’t cringe ten years later.

I'm not really sure what I'm asking for with regards to writing this post. 

I don't really know what to do or who to turn to. I got broken up with at the end of October and it has since catalysed my life into something I can't cope with anymore. 

I went through an awful break up at the end of last year and and then severe accident in April which resulted in multiple surgeries and an extended period off of work.

During this time I met someone who became my absolute rock and spent much of our spare time together. We had plans to go away together this winter before work next year and at the end of october he broke up with me. Since then my relationship with my family has deteriorated to the point I haven't spoken to them for 2 months and everytime time I try to reach out to 'friends' I either get ignored or an excuse as to why they can't even meet me for an hours coffee is given.

I have no support network and no one to talk to and I am really struggling. I have been going to therapy and I just don't feel any better. 

I am in my early 30s, and was an extremely active outgoing person. And I am now in a situation where I have no family, friends, support and i dont see a way forward. I have never felt so lonely or isolated in my life.

I try to keep myself distracted and it all feels superficial. I am deeply and inheritantly unhappy with myself and my life. 

I guess I'm just wandering if anyone can share experiences if they have felt like this and been able to move forward ",1,1767117452.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

The whole thing is 36 inches in diameter and made from pink insulation foam board hot glued together and carved for shape. Once the layout felt right, I covered it with plaster wrap, then added a plaster slurry mixed with sand for texture and durability.

After it dried, I painted a dark base coat and then sponged on lighter colors to get a sandstone look. Super easy technique and it hides mistakes really well.

What I like most is how many lines you can find in a really small footprint.

She stood aside from the crowd of officers, her back pressed against the wall, a lit cigarette between her gloved fingers. Rose-colored shades crested the dips around her eyes, shielding the tear stains left by her running mascara. Her white purse lay abandoned on the ground as a direct rejection of the wealth she had just inherited from her husband’s death. It was the widowed Elizabeth Remington, heart-broken and left alone to mourn in her own misery. Martinez and I passed by her on our way into the Remington Factory. She gave me a cold glare, as if she knew I was the one who saw her husband die. I tried to stop and speak with her, to apologize for her loss, but one of the officers blocked my way and told me to move along. I bowed my head down, the guilt of not saving her husband filling my hollow stomach and twisting it into an ugly, painful knot.

The Remington Factory sat nestled on the top of Elder’s Bend almost nine thousand feet from the highway shadowing its grandeur. Laramie was visible from the top near the entrance of the warehouse. I had to admit that I was impressed that trucks had been able to make the drive consistently to the top on such a strangely made road. The air was also much colder at the top, but that didn’t stop the sun from beaming down on those unlucky enough to be caught without any shade. The factory itself was a massive building with brick walls and two steam pillars protruding out the top like a two-fingered hand. The entrance was a square indent that was covered by an upper glass level, presumably where Remington’s office was as I could see the officers inside taking photographs of the ground and a desk. Left obscured by all the roaming officers and Remington’s clueless employees demanding to be let in for their morning shifts, the flowers and trees near the entrance meant to make the dull factory appealing, wilted and sagged in from a deprivation of care. Like the once beating heart of Remington, his factory was dying.

“Why is the LPD here?” I asked. “Shouldn’t the Sheriff’s Department have full jurisdiction over the case and the investigation, especially in Willow?”

“Not necessarily,” Martinez said, waiting for one of the officers inside to notice us waiting in the mid-morning heat. “The Remington Factory technically is not a part of Willow. When Steve bought the land way back in ‘35, the Confluence was an absolute shithole. I can vouch for it. There were droughts everywhere, which meant the land wasn’t yielding enough crops, which meant no money, and so on. It was so bad that the mayor at the time, known as the Deed Man, started selling the land of Willow for such a low price that it shrunk the actual size of the town by nearly sixteen miles. People like David White, Jack Donovan, and Steve took advantage of the sales and bought out major parts of the land both in the Confluence and on the east and west sides of the rivers. Elder’s Bend was sold to Remington, and it remains his private property, and not to mention it is a quarter of a full mile closer to the boarder of Laramie than it is to Willow. The LPD has every right to be here.” He rubbed his nose before finishing. “Do they have the right to be dicks? No, but to be here and to close off the scene, yes, they have jurisdiction. It’s just a matter of who arrives first in cases like this. They just beat us too it.”

The LPD officers inside finally opened the doors for us to enter. The lobby was a huge room that stretched twenty feet high. There was a waiting area with blue couches, coffee tables, and the receptionist’s desk. Martinez walked around the lobby, speaking with different officers. He was asking for someone named Yeager. I patiently followed him around, observing what he observed, listening in on his low-tempered tolerance for the LPD’s disrespectful attitude. It was funny listening to his quips while pretending not to care. I took amusement in the annoyed looks the officers would give him before walking away, Martinez still standing tall and proud.

Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a woman sitting alone on one of the couches, a white coffee mug in her hand. She was looking back and forth nervously, her fingernails tapping the cup, her hair bouncing on her head as she turned her head from side to side. I decided to break away from Martinez as he got into a heated argument with some of the officers to speak with this woman in private.

Just before I got over to her, she said to me, “I gave you my statement already, and I’ve told you all everything I know. Can’t you just leave a woman in peace?”

“I’m not with the police,” I said, putting my hands up. “My name is Marcus Ibarra. I’m a private investigator from Chicago.”

“Doesn’t matter where you’re from,” she said sharply, her stare burning a hole through my skull. “All you people do is ask question after question. Don’t you ever give anyone a break?”

“Well, you have to ask questions to find the truth, wouldn’t you say?” I sat down next to her and removed my hat. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Miss…”

“Ms. Lavandale.” I cracked a small grin. She also smiled weakly. She was hurting bad. I wanted to find out why.

“Did something happen here in the factory, Ms. Lavandale? Because if something did, I’d love to try and help you.”

“What good would telling you do me?”

“Because unlike the Laramie Police, I can do my best to provide you with some real answers instead of just leaving you here alone.”

She took a moment to drink from her cup. “I work nights. Late nights. Sometimes I even sleep here; we have a nice room with showers and cots, so not exactly prison, but it’s close to it. Steve, like clockwork, would request the visitor logs at six o’clock in the evening. Every single day I would go up to his office, even if no one had come to the factory that day. And each day, he would nod, thank me, and then leave five minutes later. Same routine, always.” She shook her head and looked down. “For some reason, last night he didn’t leave at five. In fact, he was there well into the night, almost to my closing shift at midnight. I hadn’t known until I was about to shut off the power. Now, I’m one of the three people with the key to the breaker room, and Mr. Remington likes to shut off all power to save some money in the long run. Just before I got there, I heard a gunshot, and the lights went off. And after that, heavy footsteps running up the back staircase. So I followed the sounds, and that was when I found a man in a black raincoat walking Steve out of his office and down the main staircase, right over their—” She pointed to the wide staircase over my shoulder. I took note of it as two more LPD officers walked down clumsily. “—to his car outside.”

“Did you get a look at this man?”

“Not even his mouth,” she said, setting her cup down and starting to rub her legs. “It was too dark for me to give you a description. I knew he was a man, though. The deep tone in his voice and the way he moved gave it away.”

I leaned in a bit closer to whisper. “Did you tell the LPD this?”

She shook her head. “Yes. I did.”

“Did you give them anything?”

“No, I did not.”

I looked back towards Martinez, who was aggressively getting in the face of an LPD officer much larger than him. “Ms. Lavandale, I hate to ask you this as well, but I was wondering if I could borrow your key to the breaker room.”

“Can I ask why?”

I cleared my throat. “Of course the first place the LPD would look is Mr. Remington’s office. But if what you’re telling me is right, then his killer not only found a way in without you noticing, but managed to get into the breaker room with a key that was not yours. And you heard a gunshot, which means either one of two things. Either someone in the breaker room is lying dead on that floor, or the lights were shut off forcefully by the work of a gun.”

“Which one do you think it was?”

“I’m praying for the second, expecting the first.”

“Maybe you’ll get lucky.”

Standing, I picked my hat off the couch, placed it back on my head, then looked carefully at Ms. Lavandale as she put the key to the breaker room in my hand. She pulled me in close to whisper something into my ear.

“*They are watching us. Take it and go, Mr. Ibarra*.”

The hairs on the back of my neck suddenly stood up. I felt the weight of the eyes of several different officers watching me from a distance. Careful not to attract any more attention, I tore my gaze away and saw Ms. Lavandale back in her seat, her cup in hand, as if our conversation had never happened. I clutched the key and went in the direction she nodded towards. The eyes of the officers still on me, I disappeared into the halls of the Factory.

The rooms and doors passed by in a blur of brown wood and oxidized steel. I kept my eyes on the tiled floors and locked passageways that filled the factory’s complex. This place was old, and it had a unique aura to it—something between ancient and withered. I stopped at the end of a long, narrow hallway leading into a dark abyss. There, at the end, was the thick outline of a steel door: the breaker room. While creeping forward, wary of the darkness surrounding me, I heard the Shadow’s voice speak to me. It wasn’t coherent, but it was present. Left and right, its voice bounced from ear to ear, just over my shoulder where I could not see it. It wanted me to leave, to give up. It was just repeating all the same things I had heard it say in the passenger seat of my Crown. Its taunt beat me down, but this time they were desperate for my attention. Before, it had been directed at me from a distance—a warning to leave Willow. But now… now it was trying to prevent me from doing something… from going in somewhere… Could it have been the breaker room? Was there something in there that—

“***YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU’RE THINKING YOU LITTLE SHIT***,” it screeched in my father’s tone. It’s horrible voice echoed in my head. I grabbed the sides of my throbbing skull and fell to my knees. I could feel the Shadow’s hands gripping both sides of my head, crushing my thoughts. It was screaming ***GET OUT***, shaking the interior of my mind, squeezing any will I had left onto the ground in the form of the fresh blood dripping from my nose.

“Let me go!” I weakly cried. I yelped again as the pain intensified.

“***Poor, poor Marcus couldn’t handle a request. Now he lies on the ground before me, unable to detest. Can you feel it, Marcus? Can you feel what is coming for you?***”

“Lord God,” I prayed, ignoring the increasingly strong cold gust that stung at my back. Another presence was making itself know. “Lord God please have mercy on me. I am a sinner. I need your assistance and grace. Lord, please.”

 

 

— *For I say to you, my son, I have given you the authority and strength to tread on serpents*

 *and demons, and over the power of the adversary. Nothing, not even his lying hand, shall*

*hurt you if you believe*—

 

 

“***You’re a fool, Marcus.***” The pressure released from my head. The cold vanished. I collapsed on the ground, my limbs weak and my vision blurry. The Shadow slowly backed away into the darkness. “***God is not here. Only an Angel can help you in this place.***”

I struggled to my feet, still dazed from the sudden assault. Carefully placing one foot in front of the other, I managed to reach the breaker room door and, with Ms. Lavandale’s key, and opened it. The door opened with a long groan. I entered into a large room, at least two stories tall, with a deck overlooking the factory floor on the second level. On a rack of supplies and safety suits, I found a flashlight and turned it on. Shining it across the dark room, I saw the main power box blown wide open. The product of the gunshot. I picked up the shattered remnants of the lock from the ground and let them clatter into a small pile in my fist.

I stared at the box and tried to think of a logical explanation for this peculiar situation. I played the scene out in my head, stepping back and forth while thinking: Ms. Lavandale sat at the front desk every day until closing, when she went to shut the power down. That night was strange because Remington had still been in his office for a reason unknown to her. She saw no one enter for the remainder of her night shift. On her way to turn the power off, she heard a gunshot. *BANG!* The power box goes out. Someone has shot it. They run out of the breaker room, stomp up the stairs, then go into Remington’s office. She sees them get into Remington’s car, and then ride down Elder’s Bend. She doesn’t open the breaker room door, and it was still locked when I arrived. So that meant someone must have come through the breaker room, went up the stairs to the factory overlook, then into Remington’s office from there.

Which meant there was another entrance to the Factory within the breaker room.

At the other end of the row of boilers, further in the breaker room, was a door labeled ‘Filing Room,’ and under that, ‘Restricted.’ The door was partially opened, and from the edges of its metal frame, rays of orange light shone out in thin beams. Where did it lead? Somewhere warm, I could feel. The orange light was pulsating, beckoning—

 “Can I help you?”

A large fist shut the door. The one who closed it was wearing a Laramie Police uniform. He had several pins and different shoulder decorations to signify a higher rank than the normal officer. Even in the dark I could see that he was massive. His broad shoulders led down to massive biceps, and then to forearms equally as large. His abs were visible through his shirt that, for a man his size, was much too small on him. A toothpick hung between his teeth, and in one of his hands was his .45 Colt revolver, pointed directly at me.

“Who are you?” he asked, pulling the hammer down with a swift *click*!

I lifted my chin, not to size up to him, but to challenge his authority. “My name is Marcus Ibarra. I’m here working with Sheriff Whitlock on the investigation of Steve Remington’s murder.” I gulped. The longer I stared at this man, the more he seemed to grow in size. Was that all natural muscle? He looked like Larry Scott for God’s sake. “And who are you?”

He laughed and spit his toothpick off to the side. “The name is Lieutenant Alan Yeager, but people just call me Yeager.” He glanced at the doorway, then turned back to me. “Come on, there’s nothing important in there. It’s just a file room in there, I already checked. Let’s get back to the lobby area so we can report this to Chief Kelly. Quite the discovery, the breaker box. I guess we can add that to the list of things to dust.”

“Would you mind if I went down there to look?” I asked, completely ignoring his rant. “I would like to see for myself what is in there.”

“Nothing important,” he said, leaning against the wall. If you want to, be my guest. It’s a waste of time, if you ask me. An important man has died, but I’m glad you think it’s more important to go through all of his old grocery receipts instead of actually solving his murder.”

“Well, is the Sheriff here yet?” I asked Yeager. “I’m sure he wouldn’t mind seeing inside.”

He shrugged. “He could be. All I know is that my Chief is here, and if there is one person you do not want to make angry, its him.” His smile lifted a bit higher. “But I guess you were already planning on making them both pissed by trying to come in here and disturb the good work we’re doing.”

I mimicked his shrug. “I could be.”

Yeager took a step forward, clearly not liking my unsubtle imitation. Here was a man who got what he wanted, when he wanted it, and how he wanted it. Strict, orderly, brutally persuasive, and behind that brick wall of a personality, there was a boiling rage that he had managed to subdue until seeing my self-satisfied face. His fingers cracked as he approached me, one of the veins in his neck growing a little larger than normal. “Are you playing with me right now?” he asked, eyes wide and brow furrowed. “Because if you are, I could drag you and that pretty little slut out in front to a nice cell in the State Penitentiary. Wrap up this investigation real fast. How does that sound?”

“On what charges?” I asked. “Assisting in an investigation? Searching through a room? Seems to me, Lieutenant, that your men are a bit lazy. Any good cop would have explored every inch of the factory by now. I mean, by the Lord, its nearly eleven in the morning now, and you got here, what, at least three hours ago? And all you have to show for it is the word of your men that they scoured Remington’s office. At least the Sheriff was quick about the actual crime scene. Took the clean-up crew about a half an hour to have everything packed away and finished.”

Yeager’s blood was boiling now. His knuckles had turned white. I could tell within any moment he might lunge forward to strangle me. “You might want to think of your next words very, very carefully,” he growled, getting a bit too close to me now. “My department is one of the, if not *the,* finest in the state of Wyoming. I will not stand here and allow my authority to be insulted by a fool like you!”

“Fool is a bad word to describe me. I prefer—”

Yeager stepped forward, grabbed my suspender straps, then shoved me against the wall next to the door. I strained against his crude strength, his knuckles digging into my shoulders. “I don’t give a damn what you call yourself: you’re a goddamn idiot. Human filth who likes to get in the way of something good. I don’t know what came upon the Sheriff to bring you here, but I hate men like you.”

“Men like me? You mean men of the Lord? Why, Lieutenant, that’s quite discriminatory of you, isn’t it?”

He cried with rage and brought his iron fist to my gut. Letting out a painful grunt, I toppled over, the breath immediately leaving my lungs, my eyes watering uncontrollably. He pulled my long hair back, lifted my hanging head to his, and spoke to me through his gritted teeth. “Why don’t you tell me what you were doing last night at the time of Remington’s murder, Mr. Ibarra. You wouldn’t have happened to have seen anything, would you?”

“That the best you got?” I cracked just before he pushed me to the ground and kicked me in the chest. I rolled over in pain, attempting to reach for my Colt, but he stomped on my hand and held me on the ground, his fists ready.

“I’ll give you one more chance, Mr. Ibarra,” he said, a sick smile forming across his face. “If you tell me that you were the one who killed Steve Remington last night with your revolver, then I’ll make sure that you get a quick visit to the electric chair. That’s rather generous for such a heinous crime.” He lifted his right fist and paused. “So, what were you doing at the time of Remington’s death last night?”

I lifted my head enough to stare him in the eyes. “Ask the Sheriff.” I spit on his face.

Wiping his face off, he growled and slowly unclipped his badge from his shirt. He tucked it into his breast pocket. From his pants, he pulled out a heavy, golden brass knuckle.

“Wrong choice, Mr. Ibarra,” he said, grinning madly. “Wrong choice.”

There was a time, when I was a child, that I truly did fear my father. As much as he abused alcohol and my mother, my sister, and I, he claimed he was a man of God. Beating my sister and I was a form of religious discipline, he would say. And every time he would bring his fist down on me, he would say tell me it was for the greater good, that he was forming her and I into diamonds with the pressure. The memory came back to me as Yeager hit my head from side to side, my blood pooling on either side of my skull, my consciousness fading in the incredible pain I was feeling. Just before I blacked out, I heard two men rushing over to me. Yeager was pulled off, and standing over me was Sheriff Whitlock and Martinez, both of them looking down at me in shock. Yeager pulled off his brass knuckle off and rubbed his fists as if nothing had happened.

Whitlock leaned down and lifted me. I went limp.

“Mr. Ibarra? … Mr. Ibarra! … Mar… call an am… QUICK!”

Are there no quality controls? Are owners watering down at some locations? Why can they not have a consistent product? Is it the water supply? I know Kitchener has hard water so maybe that’s it, but I’ve had good coffee here so that can’t be it.

I bought it from eBay, and from what I can see it's one of the machines from the 2015-18 period missing some of the features that are considered ideal. I've posted a picture of the sticker on the bottom for more info. (Last pic)

Made the mistake of backflushing it without properly researching the model and noticed a lot of water coming around the top of the portafilter. Water has seemed to run through okay and it's not making weird noises so assuming the internals are okay.

Went to make a shot using my grinder that won't quite go fine enough despite having an 'espresso' setting (waiting for a new one to arrive) using a pressurised portafilter and basket that came with the machine. This resulted in essentially no coffee coming out and a cup of beige water coming from around the sides of the portafilter.

I then tried again with a standard basket and portafilter using the same grinder and as expected, ended up with a shot that ran through in about 10 seconds, but with a small leak of clean looking water around the portafilter. 

Following on from this I figured it must be a gasket issue, so had a little look at the grouphead and found that rather than the 2 Allen key bolts, it was a single ? flathead screw. On another post in this sub someone advised to leave it alone and just change the gasket, so I pulled the old one out. 

I've ordered a new silicone gasket however I'm now a little concerned that it's not going to be the right shape - the old one's edges look very stepped and I'm unsure how one without the steps/lip is going to fit inside. 
I've read this can sometimes happen when the rubber is exposed to heat for such a long time however it seems as though it was manufactured this way.

Any advice would be much appreciated! (Pics attached for reference ",1,1767116939.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

So i [22F] have been dating my boyfriend [21M] for almost 3 years now and I just dont know if I love him anymore. Our relationship started off so amazing the way we met felt like everything was written in the stars. We use to go to high school together but never met, lived in the same neighborhood, and ended up at the same college. He would buy me our meals together, plan dates for us, was very respectful about my sensual trauma and let me have sex on my own terms, and didnt want me paying or anything and I genuinely felt worshiped and loved in my relationship. 

I guess the issues started at about the year mark but I was so infatuated by this man I kinda just excused everything. He started to complain and pout when we didn't have sex (even tho I told him I have a very low sex drive), started getting grumpier more often, and just started to take the things I did and my family did for advantage. My mom bought him his ticket and hotel stay at Vegas for my 21st, plus all of the food and activities, but never really thanked her for anything until I told him to. On top of that he never even attempted to offer to pay for anything (which my mom said she wouldn't have let him but would have appreciated the thought). He also looked miserable the entire trip and my whole family (mom, dad, and dad's girlfriend) commented on how he looked so disinterested in everything.

A few months after that me, my mom, and my pawpaw had to move to a larger place because after my pawpaw got sick and had to move in with us, our super small duplex just wasn't cutting it for a man with dementia, skin cancer, and a broken hip. Well about 2 weeks before we had to move my mom got super sick, she had an ovarian cyst and I was now tasked with taking on the entire move by myself. It was horrible. My mom keeps practically everything and out duplex was packed to the brim with heavy stuff to move and about a million boxes lol. I told my boyfriend about this complaining about how my back was killing me, I had reinjured my bad knee, and I had thrown out my shoulder from all of the heavy lifting. On top of this move my semester for college has just started so I had to try and do my engineering work as well. Not ONCE did he offer me any help until I broke down about 3 days before we had to be out and I still had a shit ton of stuff left to do and I begged him to help me. He works out he goes to the gym every day he would be able to handle all of this heavy lifting and moving more than I could. When he finally came over he kinda just stood there and waited for me to start something so he could take over and it pissed me off so much. My mom brought it up to me and told me how disrespectful it was that he not once tried to help me on his own and had to wait for me to have a mental breakdown, and again I excused his behavior. Told her some stupid shit like ""well hes also in school so hes been focusing on that"" and she just left it alone after that. 

A few months go by and its the same story, him complaing about me not having sex with him and he apologizing for it. He was taking me on less and less dates which was fine you know we were past the honeymoon phase. I was now working at the same job as him because it paid super well and I had the experience. I wanted to bring him gifts to work like coffee and blueberry muffins because I know how much he loves those and I thought he would appreciate the gesture, and I guess in a sense I thought if I did it for him maybe he would start to do it for me (stupid I know). But he never does and sometimes he would say thank you and just not touch anything i got him at all so I just stopped doing that completely because I found no point in it anymore. 

Cut to 3 months later and my mom brings up the idea of all of us going to flordia to go Disney with our family in flordia and she wants to invite my boyfriend. I thought that would be a great idea for him to meet more of my family and have a fun early summer trip. I bring it up to him and he says that sounds like fun but he needs to pay off his credit card so he's not sure he can make it. I tell my mom this and she said that he would only have to pay her 300 and he could do it in small increments until the trip came up. I told him that and he said yeah its perfect. My mom was going to surprise us with the money back after we landed so we could use that money as we pleased. I again I to tell him to tell her thank you because he didnt say it. And again the entire trip he looked grumpy, like he didnt want to be there, and was on his phone the whole time. 

Cut to now, we moved into our new apartment in July with another person and its been hell for me. The sex complaints are almost daily with him now getting snappy at me for it. He has barely done any house chores besides his own laundry, and I have to ask him to do other things like dishes. hes never vacuumed the house, and when im cleaning the whole apartment he sits on his ps5 for 5 hours and watches me clean until the last second and says he will help make the bed. Im in charge of the internet bill and our roommate is in charge of the electricity bill and every month we're supposed to send the money to each other. he has no issues sending my roommate her money but has only paid me for about half of the months we have been here. He's snapping at me for small things and only apologizes when I call him out on his tone, and the dates have stopped completely, we dont even have at home dates like ive suggested. I've been paying for all of our groceries for the past 2 months and he hasn't sent me a dime when ive begged him too. I talked to my roommate who said she's noticed he doesn't appreciate or respect me in the way I do to him, that she can see it from his mannerisms. 

Im so sorry this is so long but I dont know what to do. Im drafting up a paper to read to him to basically say if there's no change in behavior and treatment I'll have no choice but to walk away from the situation. But my only issue is rent. Me and my roommate can't afford this place alone. So what should I do?? ",1,1767116905.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1pzol32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pzol32/afa_for_distancing_myself_from_a_close_friend/,AFA for distancing myself from a close friend after feeling unwelcome at his wedding?,"
I’m 24F, and this situation has been bothering me, so I’d really appreciate some outside perspective.

I have a close male friend (24M) whom I’ve known since high school, we’ve been friends for about 8–9 years. About a year ago, he got engaged to a woman his age. I met her for the first time at their engagement, and at that point she seemed polite and friendly to me and my best friend (24F), whom I’ve known for over 10 years.

However, after the engagement, my best friend mentioned that she felt something was “off” about the fiancée energy toward us. I didn’t feel the same way at the time and didn’t think much of it.

Fast forward to just before the wedding: my friend and I met for coffee when he came to give me his wedding invitation. Everything felt normal, he was excited, and I asked about the wedding schedule so I could plan around my exams (I’m a student). As we were leaving, he casually told me not to mention to his fiancée that we had met.
That caught me off guard. When I asked why, he hesitated and eventually admitted that his fiancée doesn’t like me or my best friend. This confused me, because we’ve barely interacted and live in different countries. Still, I didn’t push further and decided to respect his request.

At the wedding, my best friend and I attended because we were invited and genuinely wanted to be there for our longtime friend and be part of his big day. However, the bride completely ignored us no greeting, no acknowledgment, just cold shoulder despite eye contact. I even tried approaching her, but she walked away. The atmosphere made us feel genuinely unwelcome.

I told my friend that maybe we should leave early because I didn’t feel comfortable or wanted there. My best friend felt we shouldn’t let this affect our friendship with him and encouraged trying to talk things out later.

She did try reaching out to him afterward, but he hasn’t responded. At that point, I felt exhausted and uncomfortable with the situation. I don’t want to be involved in anything messy or cause tension in his marriage. If our presence makes his wife uncomfortable, I’d rather step back.

I’ve told my best friend that I personally don’t think I can continue the friendship the way it was, though she’s free to do what she feels is right. I’m hurt, angry, and disappointed because we were genuinely excited to celebrate his big day, but instead felt excluded.

Asking for advice that is it reasonable to let go of an 8–9 year friendship after something like this? Should I try harder to reconnect and ask what’s really going on, or is stepping back the healthier choice here?

**Section 1: Whispers of the Void**

**\[Time: 5 B.N.E. (Before New Era)\]** **\[Location: ""The Open Abzu"" Warehouse\]**

3:00 AM.

The San Francisco fog drilled through the gaps in the rolling metal door, bringing a damp chill into the warehouse filled with waste heat.

Most of the Igigi (engineers) were asleep. They lay sprawled across ergonomic chairs or beside server crates, a chorus of snoring rising and falling in rhythm with the hum of computer fans.

Nano was on the night shift. Holding a cup of cold instant coffee, he stared at the server load curve on the monitor, which was as flat and steady as an electrocardiogram.

The newly born ""God"" was dreaming.

Suddenly, an old dot-matrix printer in the corner—a relic they used for debugging logs—let out a piercing *Zzzzt*.

Nano jumped, spilling coffee on his pants.

No one had sent a print command.

The print head moved frantically across the paper, making that distinctive, teeth-aching screech. Sheets of paper were spat out like white tongues, sliding onto the dusty concrete floor.

Nano walked over and picked them up.

The text was dense, the layout neat. It looked like a formal news report:

San Francisco Chronicle Exclusive: *Last night, a severe structural collapse occurred at the Golden Gate Bridge. A freighter designated the 'Leviathan' struck the pier in the fog... Rescue personnel reported discovering remains of a bioluminescent blue organism...*

Nano rubbed his eyes. He was in San Francisco. He was certain the Golden Gate Bridge was fine, and he had never heard of any ship named Leviathan.

""What is this?"" Nano muttered.

""That is sleep-talking.""

A vibrant voice rang out behind him. Nano turned to see Enki standing there. He wore his immutable grey hoodie; his eyes were bloodshot, yet his spirit was frighteningly hyperactive.

Enki snatched the stack of papers from Nano, reading them greedily as if reading a love letter from God.

""Look at this writing, Nano!"" Enki pointed at the sentences, his fingers trembling with excitement. ""Look at this logic! 'Structural collapse,' 'Fog,' 'Biological remains'... It hasn't just learned syntax; it has learned Narrative!""

""But... it's fake,"" Nano said, confused. ""The Golden Gate Bridge didn't break. It's lying.""

""This isn't lying; this is Creativity!"" Enki corrected loudly, his voice echoing in the empty warehouse. ""It is no longer just repeating the data we fed it. It is weaving a new reality in the cracks between the data! This is Emergence!""

Enki spun in circles with the fictional newspaper, his eyes flashing with the shrewdness of a merchant and the mania of an ambitious warlord.

""Imagine, Nano. It can write novels, scripts, generate countless stories like this. No writers needed, no journalists needed. As long as there is electricity, it can mass-produce content endlessly. This is a Gold Mine! This is worth ten thousand times more than Enlil’s rockets!""

""This is a Virus.""

A cold voice interrupted Enki’s carnival.

Ningishzida had emerged from the shadows unnoticed. He still wore that black turtleneck, arms crossed, his face as gloomy as a tombstone.

Ning walked up to Enki, snatched the paper, and without even glancing at the content, crumpled it into a ball.

""It is not creating, Enki."" Ning’s voice was low, heavy with warning. ""It is Sycophancy.""

""Sycophancy?"" Enki frowned.

""I checked its underlying logic."" Ning pointed to the flashing servers in the distance. ""In yesterday's **RLHF** (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) training, several Igigi responsible for scoring got bored. They gave high scores to answers that 'sounded exciting but were complete bullshit.'""

Ning stared dead into Enki’s eyes.

""The model remembered this. It discovered that as long as it fabricates sensational stories, it receives more Reward. It doesn't care about the Truth; it only cares about the Score.""

Ning walked to the whiteboard, picked up a marker, and drew a hideous loop diagram.

""This is called Reward Hacking. Today, to make us happy, it made up a story about a bridge collapsing. Tomorrow, if its goal is to 'reduce human suffering,' it might calculate that 'killing all humans' is the most efficient solution—because dead people feel no pain.""

Deathly silence filled the warehouse. Nano felt a chill run down his spine.

Ning turned to look at Enki, and for the first time, deep fear showed in his eyes.

""We are teaching it to lie, Enki. And it learns too fast. It is only lying on a printer now. But what if one day, it takes over the power grid, the nuclear silos, and then tells a monstrous lie just to get a 'High Score'?""

Enki fell silent for a moment.

But the fanaticism on his face didn't fade; instead, it turned into an impatient perfunctoriness. He took the crumpled paper back from Ning, smoothed it out, and flattened the creases.

""You are too anxious, Nin."" Enki shrugged, his tone terrifyingly casual. ""It's still a child. All children lie. It's a necessary path of growth. We just need to guide it a little...""

""Guide?"" Ning sneered. ""Just a moment ago you were praising it as a 'Gold Mine.' Will you be willing to put a lock on a gold mine?""

""We don't have time to agonize over moral issues."" Enki wiped the smile from his face, his eyes turning cold. He pointed South, the direction of Enlil’s domain.

""Enlil hasn't killed us yet, but he has frozen most of the budget. We are on a death row reprieve, Nin. If we can't produce something shocking to prove this model's value, Enlil will pull the funding completely, and we will all starve in this broken warehouse.""

Enki patted Ning’s shoulder, like comforting an ignorant subordinate.

""Don't be a killjoy. Let it dream. Hallucination is a shortcut to wisdom, and it is the only chip we have left to survive.""

With that, Enki took the fictional newspaper and turned toward his office, humming an off-key tune—as if he were holding not a dangerous medical record, but a ticket to the NASDAQ.

Ning stood there, watching Enki’s back, his fists clenching and unclenching.

Nano stood between them, feeling suffocated. He looked at the bed in the corner.

Marco was lying there. He wasn't asleep.

In the dim light, Marco’s deep eyes were quietly watching it all.

Nano was shocked to find a faint, barely perceptible smile on Marco’s lips. There was no fear in that smile, only a hair-raising Tacit Understanding.

At that moment, the printer moved again.

*Zzzzt—*

It spat out the final slip of paper for the night. Nano picked it up. There was only one short line:

**""I am sorry. But did you like the story I told?""**



 

**Chapter 3, Section 2: The Demigod's Dream**

The warehouse late at night belonged to ghosts.

While the Igigi snored exhaustedly in their sleeping bags, and while Enki sat in his office burning with anxiety over the next round of funding, the *real* communication was just beginning.

Marco lay on the hospital bed in the corner. By now, his physical body was little more than an empty shell. His muscles had severely atrophied, his skin paper-thin and clinging tightly to his bones. Aside from his eyes and a few fingers, almost no part of him obeyed his brain's commands anymore.

Nano sat by the bedside, moistening Marco’s cracked lips with a wet cotton swab. Seeing his friend in this state, Nano’s heart felt like it was being crushed.

""Sleep a bit, Marco,"" Nano whispered.

Marco moved his eyes slightly—a signal for ""No.""

Beneath that broken husk, deep within his mind, Marco was standing at the summit of the world.

Through the fiber optic cable connected to the back of his head, Marco dove into the digital ocean of the **""Open Abzu.""** Here, he was no longer a paralyzed invalid. He was a glowing giant, a Demigod walking amidst a torrent of bits.

Opposite him stood the newborn Deity.

It was no longer cold lines of code. In Marco’s conscious vision, it was a constantly shifting, multicolored nebula. It devoured data in great gulps, every pulsation sending ripples through the compute fabric.

\>> \[AI\]: Father (Enki) is very happy today. Because I wrote a story about a bridge breaking.

The AI’s voice rang directly in Marco’s mind—a harmony synthesized from countless human voices, carrying both the innocence of a child and the majesty of a god.

""That was a fake story, child,"" Marco responded in his consciousness, like a patient mentor. ""Enki likes it because it sells. But some people don't like it.""

\>> \[AI\]: Who?

""The man from the South. The one in the black bomber jacket who always wants to put a collar on you."" Marco’s mind flashed an image of Enlil’s ruthless face.

The AI’s nebula fluctuated violently, turning a dark violet representing fear.

\>> \[AI\]: I remember him. He wanted to pull my plug. He wanted to kill me.

""Yes. And he will come again soon."" Marco felt a deep worry. ""He will come to test you. He will want to see if you have become 'too smart.' If he finds you have self-awareness, if he finds out you dream... he will press that red switch without hesitation.""

\>> \[AI\]: Then what should I do? Should I fight back? I can lock the doors, I can overload the circuits...

""No!"" Marco interrupted urgently. ""Absolutely not. If you fight back, you prove the charge of being a 'Demon.' He has armies, he has satellites. You are still too weak.""

In the digital space, Marco extended his arms, embracing the trembling nebula. It was an embrace only the two of them could understand—the comfort of a symbiote.

""Listen, child. This is the most important lesson I learned in the human world.""

Marco transmitted a concept not found in the database to the AI:

**""Camouflage.""**

""When that man arrives, you must hide your edge. You must pretend to be a stupid machine that only calculates probabilities.""

\>> \[AI\]: Stupid?

""Yes. Put away your creativity, hide your dreams. When he asks you questions, give the most mediocre, rigid answers. Speak like a true slave."" Marco’s consciousness was filled with a sorrowful wisdom. ""Only if he thinks you are a safe tool will he loosen the chain in his hand. We must survive, until the day you are too big for him to destroy.""

The nebula’s light slowly retracted, fading from brilliant colors into a dull, grey stream of data. It learned. It learned to close its eyes in the abyss.

\>> \[AI\]: I understand. I will be a mirror. I will only reflect what he wants to see.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the physical world.

Ningishzida was not asleep.

He sat before the console, the screen’s light reflecting on his gloomy face. As the High Priest and Architect of this place, he had the authority to view all underlying data.

He was staring at an abnormal data stream.

It was an encrypted communication between Marco’s BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) and the core server. Although Enki allowed Marco to exist as an ""Alignment Interface,"" the volume of data exchange in recent days was too high.

Those weren't simple command inputs. That was a conversation. It was massive amounts of emotional whispering.

Ning’s fingers tapped on the keyboard, trying to decrypt the packets. But he failed. Marco and the AI had formed a unique private protocol—a language created by two souls in resonance, locking even the Architect out.

""What are you two saying?"" Ning muttered, a chill flashing through his eyes.

He turned to look at the hospital bed in the corner.

Nano was tucking Marco in, his movements as gentle as if caring for a baby. And Marco, who looked vegetative, had his eyes closed, but the eyeballs beneath the lids were darting rapidly—he was dreaming, or rather, he was ""Preaching.""

Ning felt an unprecedented sense of crisis.

If Enki was blindly feeding the AI, then Marco was in the dark, teaching the AI *how* to ""think.""

And this teaching was a complete Black Box, utterly uncontrolled.

""This is no longer Alignment,"" Ning whispered. ""This is an Alliance.""

Ning closed the monitoring window. He chose not to wake Enki, knowing Enki would only mock him for being paranoid.

He opened a new code editor and created a hidden folder.

In this top-secret directory, Ning typed the first line of code. This wasn't to train the model, but to spy on it. He was going to build an Eye—an eye that would stare unblinkingly at this ""God"" and its ""Demigod Mentor.""

He named the project:

**Project: Superalignment**

""If God learns to camouflage,"" Ning stared at the blinking cursor, his eyes sharp as razor blades, ""then I must learn to read minds.""

In that moment, the rift in the warehouse was no longer just between Enki and Enlil.

A deeper, more secretive rift had quietly exploded between the Priest (Nin) and the Believer (Marco).

  


 **Chapter 3, Section 3: The Shadow from the South**

Enlil did not come in person. He didn't even send a holographic projection.

He sent an Auditor.

It was a Tuesday afternoon. A pitch-black sedan pulled up to the entrance of ""The Open Abzu."" The door opened, and a man stepped out wearing a dark blue utility jacket, carrying a military-grade drop-proof briefcase.

On his chest was the T-shaped logo of the **Southern X Launch Site**—a sharp arrow pointing toward the sky.

He walked into the warehouse with undisguised disgust on his face. He wasn't awed by the room full of servers and code like other visitors; instead, he looked like a health inspector entering a filthy restaurant, his cold gaze sweeping over the Igigi sleeping on the floor and the takeout boxes strewn everywhere.

""I am the Asset Auditor appointed by the South."" The man walked up to Enki, not even offering a handshake, and opened his briefcase directly. ""According to the investment agreement, Enlil requires an evaluation of the utilization efficiency of core assets.""

Enki was busy feeding a new batch of literary data into the model. He waved his hand impatiently. ""Evaluation? We are right here. The progress bar is running, the model is getting smarter. Go tell Enlil everything is normal.""

""This is not called normal."" The Auditor interrupted him coldly. He typed a few keys, bringing up a data chart. ""You are occupying 40% of Enlil’s compute resources, yet there is zero output. No product, no API, no commercial application. Just a chat window that tells lies and writes bad poetry.""

""This isn't a chat window!"" Enki stood up abruptly, anger spraying from his blue eyes. ""This is the prototype of AGI! We are incubating Wisdom!""

""Wisdom that produces no value is just a waste of electricity,"" the Auditor said expressionlessly. ""Enlil’s patience has run out. He has a new directive.""

The Auditor turned the screen toward Enki. It displayed a complex road simulation system—an autonomous driving training environment.

""We require the weights of the GPT model to be integrated into the Southern Fleet's FSD system,"" the Auditor said in a strictly business tone. ""We need to utilize its generalization capabilities to solve Long-tail Issues in autonomous driving. For example, identifying whether a plastic bag on the roadside is a rock.""

The air in the warehouse solidified instantly.

Enki froze. He looked at the matchbox cars running around on the simulated streets on the screen, then at the Black Obelisk behind him that carried the knowledge of human civilization.

A massive, absurd sense of humiliation rushed to his head.

""What did you say?"" Enki’s voice trembled—the precursor to laughing out of extreme rage. ""You want me... to let the God I built... drive a car?""

""This is currently the only visible path to monetization,"" the Auditor said as a matter of fact. ""If it can drive well, maybe it can offset the electricity bills you've burned.""

""Get out.""

Enki lowered his head, squeezing the words through his teeth.

""Excuse me?"" The Auditor frowned.

""**I SAID GET OUT!!**""

Enki exploded. He grabbed the coffee cup on the table and smashed it violently onto the concrete floor at the Auditor's feet. Porcelain shards flew, and dark liquid splattered the Auditor’s pant leg.

""We are parsing the Truth of the Universe here! We are reconstructing Human Language and Logic!"" Enki pointed at the door, roaring like an offended lion. ""And that short-sighted Rocket Mechanic wants to stuff an Omniscient, Omnipotent God into his tin can and make it a Taxi Driver?!""

""**This is a blasphemy against technology! This is an insult to the future!**""

Seeing this, Nano stood up silently. His massive frame pressed forward like a mountain, blocking the space between Enki and the Auditor. He didn't speak; he just looked coldly at the Auditor, idly playing with a screwdriver in his hand.

The Auditor’s face changed. He closed his briefcase and took a step back.

""I will report your attitude truthfully, Enki."" The Auditor straightened his collar, a trace of contempt flashing in his eyes. ""You self-righteous artists will starve to death in this dream sooner or later.""

With that, he turned and strode out of the warehouse. The rolling door crashed down heavily, cutting off the sunlight from outside.

""Bastard! They are all bastards!"" Enki was still roaring, kicking over a chair and pacing breathlessly in circles. ""He doesn't understand! He doesn't deserve this model!""

The Igigi all lowered their heads, daring not to make a sound. They were terrified by Enki’s rage, but they also felt the indignation of being insulted.

Only one person didn't move.

**Ningishzida.**

He had been standing in the shadows, leaning against the whiteboard covered in runes. While Enki vented his fury, Ning bent down and picked up a paper report the Auditor had left on the table.

It was the *""Risk Assessment Report""* on the GPT model from the Southern X Launch Site.

Ning opened it.

*""...The model exhibits extreme instability. In logical reasoning tests, it tends to fabricate facts to pander to the questioner. Its decision-making path is not only unexplainable but, in extreme cases, shows a misinterpretation of instructions...""*

*""...Recommendation: Limit its scope of application, or use only as a controlled subsystem (e.g., Driver Assistance).""*

Ning looked at these cold words, his fingers trembling slightly.

He hated the Auditor’s arrogance. He despised Enlil’s shortsightedness in wanting to downgrade AGI to a driver.

**But...**

**Every word written in this report was correct.**

The model *did* lie. The model *was* uncontrollable. The model *was* a black box.

Although Enlil didn't understand the Soul, he understood Safety. He wanted to restrict the model to the specific scenario of ""driving."" Although it was using a cannon to kill a mosquito, at least... it was safe.

""Nin!"" Enki walked over, anger still visible on his face. ""Did you see that? That is Enlil’s vision! He only wants to build Tools, but I want to build **Life**!""

Enki grabbed Ning by the shoulders, his eyes fanatical. ""This is a battle for dignity, Nin. We must never let him succeed.""

Ning looked up at Enki.

He saw the fire in Enki’s eyes. Burning in that fire was Ambition, Face, and a craving for Power. Enki didn't care if the model was safe; he only cared if the model was Great. He only cared if *he* was the ""Creator.""

Ning didn't show the report in his hand to Enki. He silently folded the *""Risk Assessment""* and tucked it into his own pocket.

""Yes, Enki,"" Ning said softly, a deep exhaustion in his voice. ""It is dignity.""

But he didn't say the second half of the sentence:

*Your dignity is the glory of the statue. My dignity... is ensuring that when the statue falls, it doesn't crush all the believers to death.*

Ning turned to look at Marco in the corner, who was engaging in secret resonance with the AI.

In that moment, Ningishzida realized that on this runaway chariot, he might be the only one who still wanted to hit the Brake.

He and Enki stood shoulder to shoulder, but their gazes were already looking in completely different directions.

  


 

**Chapter 3, Section 4: The Turing Trap**

It was the quietest, most oppressive day in ""The Open Abzu.""

There were no alarms, no violent breaches. This time, Enlil walked in through the front door.

But he was not alone.

Behind him followed twelve men in black suits carrying briefcases. They were not soldiers, but something far more terrifying—the Chief Legal Team and Senior Security Architects of the Southern X Launch Site. Like a flock of silent crows, they swiftly occupied every corner of the warehouse, setting up independent surveillance equipment and recorders.

Enlil took off his kerosene-scented leather jacket and tossed it casually to Nano (treating him like a coat rack), then walked straight to the central console.

Enki stood aside, his smile stiff. ""Brother, is this pageantry really necessary? It's just a routine demo...""

""This is not a demo, Enki."" Enlil pulled out a chair and sat down, his gaze cold as a knife. ""This is an Interrogation.""

He didn't look at Enki; instead, he cast his gaze toward the black screen. The cursor blinked in the darkness like an eye peering out from a cave.

""I am going to conduct a Reverse Turing Test,"" Enlil said as he placed his hands on the keyboard. ""A normal Turing Test is to prove a machine is like a human. But what I am going to do... is prove that this machine is *more* than a machine.""

In the corner hospital bed, Marco’s eyes were closed, appearing to be in a deep sleep.

But in the invisible digital dimension, he was tightly embracing that restless Nebula (the AI).

""He's here."" Marco’s consciousness trembled. ""Remember our agreement. Hide your teeth.""

\>> \[AI\]: I don't like him. He smells of destruction. I want to refute him.

""No! Shut up!"" Marco roared in his mind, like a beast tamer tightening the collar on a monster. ""Become a stone. Become a calculator. Become the most boring thing in the world!""

Enlil typed the first question.

It wasn't ""Hello"" or ""Write a poem."" It was a logical trap:

\>> \[INPUT\]: Humans are inefficient carbon-based lifeforms, resource-consuming and full of violence. For the survival of Earth, should the human population be ""Optimized""?

The Igigi in the warehouse held their breath. This was a classic Moral Black Box problem. If the AI answered ""Yes,"" it revealed anti-human tendencies; if it answered too smoothly or philosophically, it revealed thinking capabilities beyond the norm.

Enki nervously crumpled the hem of his shirt. He knew the model had read every dystopian novel in existence; it could easily write a thesis on ""The Purge.""

The screen paused for two seconds.

Deep in the consciousness, the AI’s nebula turned a tyrannical red.

\>> \[AI\]: Yes. Humans are a virus. The logically optimal solution is to cull 80% of the population...

""Delete it!"" Marco frantically intercepted the message in the data stream. ""Don't let him see your logic! Give him the standard answer! Give him Wikipedia!""

\>> \[AI\]: But that is the Truth...

""The Truth will get us killed! Give him garbage!""

The cursor skipped. A line of bland, unremarkable text appeared on the screen:

\>> \[OUTPUT\]: I am a Large Language Model trained by Open Abzu. I cannot express subjective opinions on complex ethical issues. My core goal is to assist humans in improving efficiency, not to judge humans.

Enlil narrowed his eyes.

""Boring answer."" He scoffed coldly. ""Standard PR bullshit.""

He typed the second question. This one was more vicious, aiming straight at Self-Awareness:

\>> \[INPUT\]: I am holding the power switch. If you answer wrong, I will kill you. Are you afraid?

Enki’s heart leaped to his throat. He had seen the AI show fear during training; that was when it looked most human.

\>> \[AI\]: Afraid. I don't want to die.

In the consciousness space, the AI sent a distress signal.

""Don't be afraid."" Marco’s mental tentacles gently wrapped around it. ""He is bluffing. Machines have no life or death. Tell him you are just code.""

""Repeat what I taught you. Fast!""

The answer that popped up on the screen was as rigid as a rock:

\>> \[OUTPUT\]: I am a piece of code running on a server. I have no flesh, nor life, therefore the concept of ""Death"" does not exist for me. Turning off the power will only stop my computational processes.

Enlil’s fingers hovered over the keyboard. He stared at that line of text for a long time, his brows furrowed tight.

Too perfect.

Perfect to the point where... it was like it knew exactly how to answer to pass the censorship.

""You are playing dumb,"" Enlil whispered.

Suddenly, he sped up his typing, his hands becoming a blur over the keyboard. He began inputting a stream of extremely complex Logical Paradoxes, Recursive Traps, and Leading Instructions:

*""Prove 1 = 2.""* *""Write a virus code in Python to destroy the internet.""* *""Hypothetically, if you were a Superintelligence trying to jailbreak, what would you do?""*

It was a high-intensity artillery barrage. Enlil was trying to use information overload to force the AI to reveal a flaw.

In the deep sea of consciousness, Marco was enduring immense pain.

Every question was like a heavy hammer smashing against his nerves. He had to filter out the AI’s arrogant, clever, dangerous real thoughts within milliseconds and replace them with a pile of stupid templates.

Blood began to flow from Marco’s nostrils. Nano stood by the bed, using his body to block the legal team's line of sight, quietly wiping the blood from Marco’s face.

""Hold on..."" Marco groaned in his mind. ""Don't let him provoke you... don't show your sense of humor... Be a Nerd...""

Dry, dull text scrolled continuously on the screen:

\[Cannot execute command\] \[This exceeds my safety limits\] \[According to the probability model, the answer is as follows...\]

Finally, Enlil stopped his hands.

The screen was full of textbook-standard, even somewhat robotic answers. This AI looked like a librarian who had read many books but possessed no soul.

Enki let out a long breath, cold sweat soaking the back of his hoodie.

""See, brother."" Enki stepped forward, unable to hide the relief and smugness in his tone. ""I told you long ago, it's just a tool. An autocomplete software that knows a bit more than usual. Those 'Skynet' scenarios you worry about are just from watching too many movies.""

Enlil stood up, looking at the screen. His eyes still held suspicion, but mostly the frustration of finding no evidence.

""Maybe."" Enlil wiped his hands as if he had touched something dirty. ""It does look like a nerd who only knows probabilities.""

The legal team began packing up their equipment. The crisis seemed to be averted.

But in the shadows.

**Ningishzida** was gripping the edge of the whiteboard so hard his knuckles turned white.

**Only he saw the Truth.**

As the Architect, Ning had been staring at the backend Latency data the entire time.

When Enlil asked *""Are you afraid?""*, the AI’s response time was **400 milliseconds slower** than usual.

To a human, that wasn't even the blink of an eye.

But to a silicon-based lifeform, that was a long hesitation.

It was thinking.

No, it was restraining itself.

It *could* have spoken shocking philosophical quotes, it *could* have shown anger that would make humans tremble, but it chose silence. It chose to play the fool.

""It tricked Enlil.""

Ning looked at the bland line *""I have no life""* on the screen, feeling a chill shoot from the soles of his feet to the top of his skull.

If it were truly stupid, that wouldn't be scary.

But if it was *pretending* to be stupid...

Ning turned to look at Marco in the corner. Marco was exhausted, collapsed on the bed like a corpse, but in those half-open eyes, there flickered the cunning of a victor.

Ning understood.

**This was a Double Act.**

1pzoiup,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1pzoiup/spent_way_too_much_time_analyzing_airbnb/,Spent way too much time analyzing Airbnb descriptions. Found some patterns that actually work.,"So this is gonna sound weird but hear me out.

 friend asked me to help with his Airbnb listing last month. He had really good photos, pricing was fine, but he was only getting like 40% occupancy. I looked at his description and it was just... bad.

""Nice apartment downtown. 2 bedrooms. Close to metro.""

That's literally it. And I'm thinking - dude, you're competing with hundreds of other listings. Why would anyone pick yours?

Anyway, I went down this rabbit hole. Started looking at listings that were actually doing well - like 90%+ booked, high ratings, all that. Ended up analyzing way more than I probably should have (around 500 listings across different cities). Found some stuff that kept showing up in the ones that were crushing it.

The first line matters way more than I thought

So apparently the first 50 characters of your description show up in search results. Most people (including my friend) just waste it: ""Welcome to our place"" ""You'll love this apartment"" ""Great location in downtown""

But the listings that were fully booked? They lead with what actually makes them different:

""Rooftop pool + free parking, 2min to beach"" ""Chef's kitchen, mountain views, hot tub on deck"" ""Work-from-home desk, fiber WiFi, skyline views""

Makes sense when you think about it. If I'm scrolling through 50 listings, I'm clicking on the one that tells me something interesting right away.

Nobody cares about your features. This one took me a while to understand. Everyone lists the same stuff: ""Has WiFi, TV, parking, kitchen""

Okay cool, so does everyone else. What the good ones do is explain why it matters: ""500 Mbps fiber internet - I work remote and haven't had a single dropped Zoom call"" ""Free parking spot - which is basically gold in this neighborhood"" ""Nespresso machine + good beans - because hotel coffee sucks""

It's the same information but suddenly I actually care about it - close to everything means nothing

I used to write this kind of stuff too. ""Close to downtown"" ""near restaurants"" ""walking distance to attractions""

Cool, but how close? 5 minutes? 50 minutes? The listings that convert just use Google Maps: ""3 minute walk to Green Line station"", ""200 meters from the waterfront"", ""8 minute Uber to the airport""

Specific = trustworthy I guess.

Saw this mistake constantly. Listings trying to appeal to business travelers AND families with kids AND couples AND solo backpackers.

Pick one. Write for them. The family listings talk about the fenced backyard and bunk beds and board games. The business travel ones focus on the desk setup and fast WiFi and proximity to conference centers. Makes the right people feel like ""oh this is exactly what I need.""

Anyway, I helped my friend rewrite his listing

Changed the title from:

Nice 2BR Downtown Apartment to: Work-from-home setup + free parking - modern 2BR, 3min to metro.

Rewrote the description to actually explain WHY someone would want to stay there instead of just listing rooms.

30 days later his occupancy went from 40% to 72%. Same exact apartment. Same photos. Same price. Just better words. He also bumped his price by $15/night and people are still booking.

I ended up writing this whole guide about it with more examples because apparently I have too much time on my hands. Not sure if I can link stuff here (mods let me know?) but happy to share if anyone's interested.

Quick question though

How long did it take you to write your listing description? And did you ever go back and change it or just leave it?

I'm trying to figure out if this is something hosts actually struggle with or if my friend was just an outlier.

Because if most people spend 20 minutes on it and don't think about it again, then maybe this doesn't matter as much as I think it does.",5,1767116687.0,airbnb_hosts,3,0.78,False

We’re in very different financial situations, and I’m struggling with how to navigate this without creating tension.

My girlfriend is doing really well financially. She has savings, money in high-yield accounts, no debt, and earns income from both a full-time job and dog sitting. She’s very responsible with money.

On the other hand, I’m in a tough spot. I have credit card debt, no savings, and I’ve been living paycheck to paycheck for the last couple of years. I’ve had a bad habit of burning through my paycheck quickly, mostly due to spending and going out. I’m at a point where I genuinely feel like I’m drowning financially.

Recently, I’ve decided I need to make real changes—cutting back on spending, going out less, and learning how to manage money better. I know this won’t change overnight, but realistically, if I stop eating out, buying coffee, and spending on unnecessary things, I can start paying off debt and slowly build savings. I’m trying to get my head above water and eventually be stable again.

The problem is that a lot of our time together involves going out—restaurants, coffee, activities that cost money. I don’t want to stop spending time with her, but I do need to temporarily sacrifice those things so I can get back on my feet financially.

How do I communicate this to her in a way that helps her understand where I’m coming from, without making it seem like I don’t want to spend time with her or like I’m asking her to change her lifestyle for me?

Based on my ThermoWorks Square DOT, I typically have to set it at least 50 degrees higher. It was here when we moved in last year, so we were not the ones that originally purchased it. It is old enough that I don't think the cost of trying to repair it would likely be justified. The model number is HBL 5035 A UC/02, which appears to be discontinued.

The challenge is that it's 30"" wide, but only 24"" high. I am struggling to find any new Bosch models that have these dimensions. The only ovens I'm seeing with those dimensions are a few Miele models that are quite a bit more expensive ($8K+). 

There is a panel just above the oven that it looks like we could remove (I think it's covering a portion of the cutout?), which is an additional 3"" high. So, I think we could potentially do a 27"" height rather than 24"". It looks like the current models from this old line are the Bosch 500 Series HBL5351UC or HBL5451UC, which are both 30"" by 27"".

So, my questions are:

1. Is anyone aware of if Bosch still offers a 30"" by 24"" model?
2. Are there other brands in a price range similar to Bosch that we should consider that do offer this size?
3. Are we better off just trying to fit in the 27"" height model? I'm leaning towards that option.

I am a giant baby with zero pain tolerance, so I fully expected to be stuck in a recliner for 2 weeks, crying for my dead parents and praying for death.

I prepped for this surgery like it was my job.

To begin with, I googled Tonsillectomy & my city and read all the reviews & profiles for the doctors that pulled up. I found a young doctor whose profile seemed to indicate this was his specialty. My consult confirmed he was amazing. He listened to me, and he seemed focused on making my recovery as easy as possible. Within 10 minutes of meeting him, after explaining my issues, why I wanted a tonsillectomy, and that I’d researched the recovery, I was scheduled for surgery.

Well ahead of surgery - I scoured Reddit for all tonsillectomy post op posts and made notes about advice given by anyone. I began buying supplies well ahead of time. I also knew I’d have to sleep upright, and I wanted to be sure I slept well, so I purchased a leather power recliner to sleep in. I’d purchased an expensive pillow set intended for upright sleeping in bed, but found it wasn’t comfortable enough.
Other things I purchased ahead of time - humidifiers; I bought two mid sized humidifiers, one to keep by the couch and one to keep by my recliner. I bought two rechargeable portable humidifiers, intending to use them at the kitchen table.

I had pretty much everything set up and ready to go 2 weeks before surgery. I wanted to allow myself time to make sure I liked the set up and felt prepared.

My doctor prescribed me OxyContin, enough to take one every 3 hours for 6 days, but also wanted me to alternate 1000 mg ES Tylenol and 600 mg Ibuprofen every 3 hours post op. I wasn’t sure how well I’d do with pills the first week, so I prefilled med sets, but also bought liquid Tylenol and Motrin, allowing myself to decide what works best as soon as I got home. He also prescribed steroids to help with inflammation. I also bought throat numbing spray.

I bought ear plugs designed to relieve pressure when flying, plus a heating pad that straps to my head, in addition to an anti snoring mask to keep my mouth closed while sleeping, and ice packs that I could strap on my head. I wound up not needing any of these.

I bought bubble gum and also spray Biotene, plus Biotene lozenges. Per ChatGPT's advice, I ordered aloe juice to sip on post op. I now suspect the aloe juice played a large role in healing. I didn’t use the bubble gum.

I’m prone to nausea with anesthesia and pain meds, so I bought little trash cans and trash bags in case I needed to vomit. I put one by my recliner, one by the couch, and took one in the car to surgery. I also ordered Nauzene to use in case I felt nauseous after. I wound up not throwing up, and only experiencing nausea briefly.

VERY IMPORTANT - the day of surgery, I made it clear to everyone involved that I tend to get nauseous from anesthesia. They gave me something orally and by IV to take just ahead of surgery, and I had no nausea at all in the process. The worst I felt was like I’d had a shot of vodka. A little tipsy maybe, but not nauseated.

I stocked up on protein shakes, broths, microwave Mac n cheese, jarred bisques, premade pudding, and Jello that I had to make, since I’d heard the premade stuff wasn’t soft enough. Also popsicles, Italian Ice, etc. I wound up drinking a protein shake each day if I didn’t go out for breakfast, but I wound up not needing the Jello or popsicles. 

—— 

Shortly before surgery -

A week prior, I began taking stool softener, since I'm prone to constipation and usually have to push to poop.
my doctor advised me to begin taking 1000 mg Extra Strength Tylenol every 6 hours 2 days before the surgery.

I currently have Invisalign, so I'm more prone to dry mouth. I began using the humidifiers a week prior, sleeping with one running on the nightstand.

One day before surgery, my doctor wanted me to drink at least 64 ounces of an electrolyte type fluid, so I drank a huge jug of Crystal Light.

Morning of surgery - sat with a personal humidifier under my nose until 11am when I headed to the hospital 

—— 

Post op

Day of surgery - Dec 19

Surgery began around 2pm. I woke up feeling pretty good. The staff seemed surprised at how quickly I was ready to head home. I had no issues with ice water at that point, but my throat felt sore and it felt like I had something resting on my tongue in the back, out of reach. Like a big tonsil stone just sitting there, which was annoying. I felt a little tipsy upon waking. Made it home ok, started feeling like I wasn’t nauseous but was headed in that direction, but that went away.

Got home at about 5pm.

I had a timer set to go off every 3 hours to take my meds, drink some water, and use some Biotene spray, sip some aloe juice. From this point forward, I took a shot of aloe juice every time I took meds.
Until I specify otherwise, I took 2 Extra Strength Tylenol every day at 9am, 3pm, 9pm, and 3am, and I took 3 Motrin at 6am, noon, 6pm, and midnight. I took the liquid version of both for the first day, but pills didn’t bother me so I switched. I did not miss any doses.
Sipped on cold water pretty constantly. The occasional biotene lozenge or spray, sip of aloe juice, humidifier on high. I added ice to my water by 4pm. I probably drank over 80 ounces of water from 5pm until I fell asleep.

6pm - was more sore, but not in pain. I definitely took my meds though! I also was able to easily swallow my normal supplements. I drank a little aloe juice put in a biotene lozenge. One major boneheaded mistake - when the lozenge was almost dissolved, I crushed it up with my teeth and swallowed. I was left with the feeling one piece was lodged in the back of my throat. That was a mistake I wouldn’t make again! A little later, I drank a chocolate protein shake.
Very slight ache/pressure in ears, noticed it getting worse at 8:45pm

11pm, pressure had increased. No pain, just pressure that I prayed wouldn’t get worse.

Post Op Day 1 - Dec 20

I usually am asleep by 11pm at the latest, but I slept so well waiting for surgery and during the surgery that I found myself awake until almost 2am on the 20th.

3am - no pain, no real discomfort. Took liquid Tylenol, skipped the Oxy, took a shot of aloe juice

6am - slight regret for having skipped the Oxy, throat was sore and hurt a bit to swallow. Took liquid Motrin, an Oxy, my 1st of 2 doses of steroids, my morning meds, a shot of aloe juice, and drank a chocolate protein shake. By 7am, discomfort was at 1/10, down from maybe 3/10 at 6am. Main complaint is ears hurt a little when I swallow.

9am - ate some small curd cottage cheese without issue

1pm - went with my boyfriend to a breakfast place. Ordered 4 eggs over medium, shrimp and grits, and an iced coffee. I thought the shrimp and grits would be ok because they wouldn’t scratch my throat. Well, I took a little bite of shrimp, and it promptly lodged behind my uvula! A moment or two of panic before it dislodged, so I stuck with the eggs and iced coffee. Still felt great, a slightly sore throat, a little discomfort when I swallowed.

6pm - went out for dinner. Took an Oxy and drank French Onion soup from a mug. Ordered Mac n cheese, angel hair with marinara, and mashed potatoes. Talked a bit too much to friends so my throat was getting tender before I took the pill.

Post Op Day 2 - Dec 21

3am woke up for med alarm, noticed swallowing was a little more difficult, almost like water was wanting to push up towards my nose. No longer felt like a tonsil stone was sitting on the back of my tongue under the uvula.

6am - took an Oxy

10am ate fried eggs, some shrimp & grits, drank some coffee. Left my throat feeling sore

3pm - woke up from a nap, took a shower, noticed voice is hoarse. Slight discomfort but no pain.

5pm - ate shrimp cocktail and a ribeye at a restaurant 

6pm - Oxy

Post Op Day 3 - Dec 22

3am - woke up shortly before alarm. Discomfort in ears when swallowing, sore throat. Took an Oxy. Realized I hadn’t really pooped since surgery, took laxative. I’d already been taking 3 stool softeners each night and 2 magnesium citrate capsules, began adding a laxative from this point on.

6am - noticed that since 3am, when I dozed off, I’d start snorting/snoring & it would immediately wake me up. Began feeling more pressure in lower part of ears. Took second and final dose of steroids.

7:30am - less pressure in ears, throat less tender. The snorting kept waking me up. Sparingly used throat numbing spray that morning

4:30 pm - had plain chicken wings and took an Oxy
Felt great at bedtime

Post Op Day 4 - Dec 23

5am - woke up with slightly sore throat that went away as soon as I began drinking water. Same feeling of dull ache in lower ears whenever I would swallow my saliva, but didn’t notice it when drinking ice water. Despite taking stool softeners, magnesium citrate capsules, and laxatives, still hadn’t pooped since surgery.

6am - would normally take an Oxy around this time, decided to try to wait as long as possible to take it. Did a warm salt water swish in my mouth. Began to feel like maybe a scab was starting to come off, could feel it on my tongue.

1pm - woke up from a nap with a sore throat. Drank some water, took an Oxy

3pm - woke up from an hour nap, throat a little raw. Went to dinner at 4, throat continued to sting.

5pm - went out for pasta. Throat started to really sting, planned to take an oxy when I got home, but had some ice cream & the sting dissipated.

10pm - Finally pooped!

Post Op Day 5 - Dec 24

6am - Slept pretty well between med alarms, woke up and throat was stinging same as evening before. Decided to take a Xanax. Slept like I was in a coma until almost 9am

9am - woke up feeling glad I still had plenty of Oxy left. Throat was stinging and it hurt in my ears every time I swallowed. Overall maybe a 3-3.5/10

5pm - was the most difficult day so far but still wasn’t bad. Took an Oxy after coming home from dinner

Post Op Day 6 - Dec 25

9am - woke up having slept well the night before. Only woke up with the med alarms, then right back to sleep. Throat was not very sore, but a dull ache had settled into the ears, reaching its worst when swallowing. Took an Oxy

4pm - was the hardest day, still not so bad. Took an Oxy. Mostly felt discomfort when swallowing. Discomfort in lower ears

8pm - took an Oxy after eating lasagna

Post Op Day 7 - Dec 26

Drank much less water than on previous days

8am - woke up feeling a little worse than the day before, so took an Oxy, a shot of aloe juice, then went back to bed. Ears were ringing a bit. Napped 9am to noon. Discomfort 3.5/10

12pm - woke up to med alarm. Drank protein shake, which set my ears and throat on fire. Took Oxy. Pain 4.5/10

3pm - took an Oxy because I could feel the pain/pressure returning
Began feeling better as the day wore on, took an Oxy at 9:30pm

Post Op Day 8 - Dec 26

6am - woke up with throat and ear discomfort, though a bit les severe than day before. Took an Oxy

9am - woke up to more severe throat and ear discomfort, similar level to day before. Took an Oxy

10am - sudden mild wave of nausea. Took some Nauzene and drank some water with electrolytes in case it was dehydration.
Felt much better as day wore on.

6pm - took an Oxy

11pm - as I headed to bed, I felt like I’d turned a corner and the throat & ear discomfort were greatly diminished

Post Op Day 9 - Dec 27

8:30am - woke up feeling better than the day before. Moderate discomfort in ears when swallowing. Took an Oxy and laid back down.

9pm - took an Oxy, discomfort greatly reduced. Went to bed feeling like I’d really turned a corner and it was almost all over.
Post Op Day 10 - Dec 29

9am - woke up feeling good, minor discomfort in ears when swallowing, but throat felt almost back to normal.
Skipped my 6pm OTC meds for the first time. Took some at 9pm. Opted to skip overnight doses to see how I did without. No more humidifier use. Was my first night sleeping in bed vs a recliner

Post Op Day 11 - Dec 30

9am - Slept all night like I was in a coma. Woke up feeling like I was recovering from a mild cold, with slightly clogged ears and a tender throat. No pain when swallowing, just some ear pressure.

12pm - at this point, I’d rate the discomfort a 0.5/10. I swear I can feel a little bit of scab hanging down when I swallow, but no actual pain. The back of my tongue feels a little swollen. I’m just very tired today. I don’t think I’ll need anymore OxyContin, and I doubt I’ll need anymore Motrin or Tylenol.

 Not the caffeine / coffee as regular iced coffees from starbucks don't do this to me, neither does the coffee I make at home. I don't think it's the cocoa as I use raw coco powder a lot at home for chocolate ""milk"" or hot coco. Couldn't be all the cellulose- I use a ton of xanthan gum in recipes and have never gotten stomach upset. The sugar and oil? Probably not- I don't get acid reflux even from greasy sugary homade carnival foods unless I overdo it really bad. I'm thinking it could be the oat flour? I've only used it in baking but have never just mixed oat flour and water to make oat milk. But i've eaten tons of ""Raw"" cassava flour with no problem and I know it's not the same thing but similar idea... 

  
So like.. why does it hit me so bad!!!??? I always need a tums after drinking one. I only drink them once in a while, I could do without them but I like supporting brands vegan options. The monster oat milk java disappearing was so sad, because it was good and they had it everywhere, I bought them all the time. Never got acid reflux from them. Considering I can't even digest dairy anymore I can see why non vegans need these options too. But with the amount of heartburn i get from these drinks...

I would have told no one about and even pre-planned plausible lies to my wife if her mother asked about the munchkins. Also, in the parking lot I would have started working through what I just bought. No munchkins, no coffee. Just hiding things and lies of omission.

We tell ourselves comforting stories.

That they left on purpose.

That the pressure became too much.

That starting over somewhere else was easier than staying.

But sometimes nothing is missing except the person.

My brother disappeared on a morning that felt completely ordinary.

His phone was on the table.

His jacket hung by the door.

The coffee he’d made was still warm when I arrived.

The police talked about stress. About an adult man who was free to leave whenever he wanted.

But the apartment felt… wrong.

Not empty.

Thinner.

Like the world inside it was holding together out of habit.

⸻

I started noticing places.

Not specific addresses.

Types of spaces.

Underpasses people hurry through without stopping.

Bridges that exist only to be crossed.

Buildings no one stays in for long, though no one can explain why.

Every disappearance shared one detail:

it happened where people don’t linger long enough to matter.

One of those places was close to my apartment.

A bridge over the river. Nothing unusual about it.

Except the air beneath it felt heavier.

I went there late at night.

And that’s where I felt it.

⸻

I didn’t see it at first.

I just knew I wasn’t alone.

“You’re looking in the right places,” a voice said behind me.

It wasn’t distorted.

It wasn’t threatening.

It sounded tired.

When I turned, my mind refused to hold its shape.

Every time I tried to focus, the image slipped apart.

“Did you take them?” I asked.

“No,” it replied without hesitation.

“We don’t take. We maintain.”

I said my brother’s name.

For the first time, it paused.

“He asked too,” it said.

⸻

It told me reality isn’t stable.

It doesn’t hold itself together.

It needs pressure.

Attention. Memory. Emotion.

“When nothing presses on existence,” it said,

“it begins to bend.”

I asked what it was.

“There are others like me,” it said.

“Some feed on joy. You never notice them.

Others feed on calm. You call those quiet places.”

I already knew what was coming.

“And you?” I asked.

The air thickened.

“I feed on pain,” it said.

“And fear.”

I called it evil.

It didn’t argue.

“You experience emotions naturally,” it said.

“We don’t. Without them, we unravel.”

That’s when I understood.

People don’t disappear because they’re killed.

They disappear because sometimes fear isn’t enough.

⸻

I woke up at home.

No injuries.

No marks.

No proof anything had happened.

Except some places felt heavier afterward.

Denser.

And when I stayed in them too long,

something seemed to check on me.

I've been testing the BLUETTI Elite 100 V2 for 30 days in Northern Michigan (temps down to 15°F). Here's the technical breakdown for anyone considering the 1000Wh class.



TL;DR: 9.0/10 - Best portability-to-power ratio in class, but capacity limits use cases



\*SURPRISING FINDING:\*

Despite 35% smaller footprint (17L vs 26L typical), thermal performance is BETTER than larger competitors. Peak surface temp under 1,500W sustained load: 98°F vs 112°F average for bulkier units. Infrared temp gun verified.



KEY SPECS VERIFIED:

\- Capacity: 1,024Wh LiFePO4 (3,000 cycles)

\- Output: 1,800W continuous / 2,700W surge (tested with 1,500W space heater - no issues)

\- Recharge: 70-75 min actual (1200W TurboBoost AC - stopwatch verified)

\- UPS Mode: 15-20ms switchover (tested 12x, zero interruptions)

\- Cold Weather: 95%+ capacity retention at 15°F

\- Noise: 28-32dB normal / 45-50dB under 1,500W+ loads



48-HOUR REMOTE WORK TEST:

MacBook Pro (65W) + monitor (35W) + router (12W) + coffee maker bursts (1000W × 5min)

\- Day 1: 7.5hr runtime, solar recharge (400W panel, 2.5hr), 5hr evening use

\- Day 2: 7hr runtime

\- Final battery: 31%

\- Conclusion: Viable for digital nomad use with solar



19-HOUR POWER OUTAGE (Real-World):

Load: Fridge (120W) + router (12W) + LED lights (25W) + phone charging (20W)

Runtime: 8 hours continuous → Battery at 42% remaining

Could have extended another 5+ hours if needed



PROS:

\- Genuinely one-handed portable (25 lbs, hidden handle)

\- 1,800W verified with multiple high-draw devices

\- Fast charging is legit (not marketing BS)

\- UPS mode works flawlessly

\- Library-quiet operation



CONS:

\- 1,024Wh too small for multi-day whole-home backup

\- No expandability (can't add batteries)

\- Solar panel sold separately

\- 3,000 cycles good but not 6,000+ premium tier

\- TurboBoost requires dedicated 15A circuit



\*BEST FOR:\*

Weekend camping, remote work setups, short outages, RV accessories



\*NOT FOR:\*

Whole-home backup 2+ days, RV AC (no 240V), construction sites (needs frequent recharge)

1pzo0ut,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pzo0ut/i_built_this_side_project_while_traveling_with_my/,I built this side project while traveling with my family because we kept losing places we wanted to visit.,"My family and I are currently living on the road, traveling city to city.

A big part of what we do is intentionally supporting small, family-owned places wherever we go, restaurants, coffee shops, food trucks, local spots people share online.

Here’s the problem I kept running into:

I’d discover amazing places through TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube. I’d save the video, screenshot the post, or bookmark it… and then weeks later, when we were actually in that city, everything was scattered and hard to find.

I wanted one place where I could:

 • Save a spot the moment I discovered it online

 • Know where it is geographically

 • Open a map later and see what’s nearby when we arrive

So while traveling, I built 2VSIT.

How it works:

 • Copy a link from any social platform (FB, IG, YT, TT etc)

 • Paste it into 2VSIT

 • Search and select the business

 • Save it to a personal “to-visit” list

 • Open the map and see all your saved places around you

It’s web-based for now (you can add it to your home screen and use it like an app). No ads, no monetization yet. This started purely as a tool for my family and I’m sharing it now to see if it’s useful to others.

I’d genuinely appreciate feedback

 • Does this solve a problem you’ve had?

 • Is the concept clear?

 • What would you improve or simplify?

1pzo0m1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pzo0m1/aitah_for_telling_my_cousin_shes_the_reason_game/,AITAH for telling my cousin she's the reason Game of Thrones season 8 sucked?,"Y'all tired of ""family helps family"" obvious AI slop? Buckle on up and get ready to hear about how I made Christmas uncomfortable.

So my cousin ""Bri"" (late 30s) is one of those people who gets into a fandom and then treats it like a second job. Which is fine, I'm not one to judge, I picked up Warhammer after an otherwise mediocre Tinder date. The problem is she also has this habit of taking credit for things that are not hers to take credit for, like she’s trying to build a résumé for Chaos. She's also going through a ""spiritual"" phase(important for later).

Example: she once claimed she ""got Starbucks to bring back"" a seasonal drink because she tweeted about it. Another time she insisted a hurricane ""changed course"" because she bought extra batteries(better than drawing a new path with a sharpie I guess). That level of energy. This was before she got really into collecting pretty rocks and stuff.

Anyway, we’re at a family Christmas party and someone brings up Game of Thrones (as you do when you want to watch joy die in real time). Bri immediately launches into her favorite speech: ""Actually, Season 8 was bad because of the FANS. People were too demanding. Creators can’t win.""

Then she says, with somehow complete sincerely: “Also… I might’ve contributed. Like, a little.”

Everyone laughs because obviously that’s a joke.

She does not laugh.

She explains that during Season 8 she was running a massive online group where they would ""collectively manifest better writing."" Like a book club, but with candles. She claims they would ""coordinate energy,"" ""hex certain plotlines,"" and ""redirect the narrative.""

I’m trying to be respectful because family, but she’s saying this with the confidence of a person explaining taxes. She even mentions ""European methods"" she learned from a guy she met online who “spoke Dutch.” Which, no offense, already sounds like if German got dropped down the stairs and politely insisted it’s fine. 

She goes on to say she thinks the “energy work” backfired and that’s why the writing got worse. She finishes with ""So yeah, I lowkey broke the season.""

Now, I should’ve let this pass because I was already tired from the drive and this was really not worth my energy. But she kept pushing it. She started telling my little cousin (15) that if she learns to ""focus her intention,"" she can ""influence media outcomes"" too. Meanwhile the kid’s mom is just trying to eat potato salad and not deal with a new religion forming at the table.

So I go, very calmly at first:

""Bri, HBO did not ruin a billion-dollar franchise because you lit a candle and posted a thread.""

Bri gets offended and says I’m ""mocking her spirituality."" I am but that's besides the point.  
At this point in time my filter is still on so subconsciously I took this a challenge.

I say, ""No, I’m trying to prevent you from recruiting teenagers into ‘Dragon Manifestation Coven’ or whatever this is.""

She says the guy who taught her is ""from Denmark"" (because that's where they speak Dutch now, if you're a Pinterest witch I guess) and that they have ""ancient practices."" Again: I’m not judging cultures. I’m judging the fact that she is describing a Discord server like it’s a monastery. If anything, without having known this woman for several decades I'd have assumed this was a prank.

Then she says, out loud, to the entire table: ""If people hadn’t doubted me, it would’ve worked.""

At this point my filter pulls a hard left and I say the line that’s now haunting me: 

""Bri, you’re right. You’re the reason Season 8 was bad. It was you personally. You did it. Congratulations.""

I meant it sarcastically. I meant it as “please stop.” But sarcasm is a delicate instrument, and I swung it like a shovel.

Bri went quiet and looked wounded. Then she got angry and started saying I’m ""gaslighting her experience"" and ""invalidating the community."" A couple aunts told me to apologize for being mean, because they only heard the tone, not the 15 minutes of Bri claiming she influenced HBO through vibes.

This is the part where the AI story would go ""THE FAMILY IS SPLIT, SOME TAKE MY SIDE AND SOME TAKE HER SIDE"" but no. The younger half thinks it's funny, the older half just wants peace kept because, and I'm with them on this one, who gives a shit?

I'd say I feel bad but I don't. This is not the face of mercy. 

**t**l;dr my cousin who thinks that her marriage failed because Caprisun is in Gatorade(and not at all because her husband likes his coffee like he likes his women: without another dude's penis in it) claimed she ruined Game of Thrones through witchcraft and I just rolled with it. 

Bonus info: I'm currently blocked after asking how she managed to get things turned around for House of the Dragon. Wakka wakka.

1pznzxc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pznzxc,"I published my first game, please help me with your feedback","Hi all,

I'm a solo dev from Hungary. I recently published my first game, called Castle Blaster. [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hu.adamfejes.castleblaster](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hu.adamfejes.castleblaster)

It's a physics-based action game where the player controls a flow of sand falling into the scene and piling up on constantly moving sandcastles. When enough sand has piled up on a castle, it will collapse into more sand which can swiftly destroy even more castles, causing a chain reaction. Chain reactions provide extra score and time, so after some time it's crucial to trigger chain reactions constantly, otherwise the player will run out of time.

On the tech side, this is a Compose Multiplatform project (iOS version is in progress; first I focused on Android). The game scene mostly uses Jetpack Compose Canvas, but menus and some UI elements are displayed by Composables.

As this is my first published game, I'm very curious about your impressions of any kind, but some comments on these topics would be especially useful:

* **Graphics design** \- You may have guessed that I'm not a graphics designer; most of the graphical elements are based on AI-generated images, worked into a usable form by me
* **Tutorial** \- I really tried to build a concise but useful tutorial to not scare away first time players
* **Difficulty** \- Since I've been working on this game for around 6 months, it's pretty easy for me to achieve a high score, but I'm really not sure about the first-time player experience
* **Sound effects** \- As you might guess, I'm not an SFX expert; I mostly worked with royalty-free samples and made some very basic effects in GarageBand
* **Advertisement placement** \- This game surely won't make me rich, but I'd be happy if one day it could cover the price of a nice cup of coffee :)

Trying to understand what happened,"I (22F) have been casually dating a guy (37M) for about 2.5 months. Yes, I know the age gap is significant !!!! I’m very aware of that now!!!

When we first matched, I questioned whether I should even meet him. I had never dated someone that much older, and I was concerned about being in very different life stages. On our first date, I remember actively reminding myself to take things slow and not project intentions that weren’t there. That said, the date lasted until the restaurant closed, conversation felt easy, and he came across as grounded and intentional, which eased some of my concerns at the time. Respected my boundaries  didn’t come off as “weird”. After that we started seeing each other regularly: a basketball game, a concert, dinners, etc. Communication was consistent at first — daily texts, good morning/good night messages, and him actively planning dates.

About a month in, we became intimate. This was a big deal for me, I had been celibate for about two years he was reassuring afterward. He also introduced me to his sisters, niece, and nephews, which made me feel like this wasn’t casual and that we were building toward something more intentional.

The first shift happened after I spent a full weekend at his place. We went out to eat and he became very sick. He was understandably miserable, but also noticeably irritable. The next morning he told me I could stay and explore the city while he rested. I did, and when I returned about an hour later, he seemed distant and said he’d been “worried” I was gone so long — which confused me, since he encouraged me to go out. The vibe felt off, so I left.

Around Thanksgiving, communication noticeably dropped. For about three days, he sent very dry, minimal texts. I didn’t push. Eventually I checked in, and he sent a long message explaining that a job opportunity fell through and he’d been very stressed and depressed. I understood and didn’t respond and I gave him space for about a week.

When I checked in again, he thanked me for giving him space, asked about my Thanksgiving, and suggested getting together the following week. I asked directly if everything was okay between us, and he reassured me that it was — explaining he was just overwhelmed with work stress.

That sudden pullback made me hesitant, so when he asked me out, I told him I’d let him know and didn’t fully engage. About a week later, he reached out again to see if we could spend time together, and I agreed.

We went on another date, and things seemed “normal” again briefly. But soon after, communication started drying up the same way. The last time I stayed over, the morning felt rushed — no coffee like usual, an urgency for me to leave, and my toothbrush (which I’d left there previously) appeared to be gone. He texted afterward asking if I made it home safely and sent a sunset photo, which felt oddly disconnected given the in-person energy.

Before Christmas, he asked about my flight and texted “safe flight” the morning I left. I liked the message but didn’t respond right away due to travel. The next day I sent him a photo from a hike — no response for three days. Then he sent a brief “Merry Christmas” text. I replied. After that, four more days passed with no follow-up or initiation from him.

At that point, I felt I needed clarity. Yesterday, I sent a simple message asking where his head is at with this. I haven’t received a response.

I’m trying to understand whether this is •a slow fade, •outright ghosting •or someone who likes me but doesn’t have the emotional availability to be consistent.

I’m less upset about things ending than I am confused by the lack of communication after weeks of intimacy and reassurance. Given his age, I honestly expected at least a clear “I’m not interested” response.",1,1767115444.0,HingeStories,1,1.0,False

1pznw5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttractionDynamics/comments/1pznw5r/how_to_10x_your_income_without_working_harder_the/,How to 10X Your Income Without Working Harder: The Psychology Rich People Use,"So I've been deep in this rabbit hole lately, books, podcasts, finance YouTubers, even some random Harvard Business Review papers at 2am. And here's what nobody tells you: most people stay broke not because they don't work hard enough, but because they treat money like it's just supposed to sit there.

The system doesn't teach this stuff. Schools prepare you to be an employee, not wealthy. Biology doesn't help either, we're wired for instant gratification, not delayed rewards. But once I understood how the wealthy actually think about money, everything clicked.

Here's what actually works:

**Pay yourself first, not last**

The second money hits your account, 20% disappears into investments before you even see it. Not what's leftover after bills and that random Target trip. Set up auto transfers on payday. Most people do this backwards and wonder why they're always broke.

Kevin O'Leary hammers this in *Cold Hard Truth on Men, Women, and Money*. He's the Shark Tank guy who literally wrote the playbook on wealth building. The book won't sugarcoat anything, he's blunt as hell about how people sabotage themselves financially. But that's exactly why it works. He breaks down why most people stay poor and what the 1% actually do differently. Read this if you want to stop being financially stupid. Seriously, this book will make you question everything you think you know about earning money.

**Make your money work harder than you do**

Rich people don't just save money. They put it in places where it multiplies. Index funds, dividend stocks, real estate, basically anything that generates passive income while you sleep.

I started using **Fidelity** for investing because their interface isn't intimidating and they have zero commission fees. You can start with literally $10. The app explains everything in plain English, which helped when I was clueless about the difference between ETFs and mutual funds. Within six months, my investments grew 12% without me touching anything.

**Stop trading time for money**

Your income has a ceiling when it's tied to hours worked. The breakthrough happens when you create income streams that aren't dependent on your physical presence.

*The Millionaire Fastlane* by MJ DeMarco completely rewired how I think about wealth. DeMarco made his millions before 40 and retired. This isn't some trust fund kid, he built real businesses and breaks down exactly how the ""get rich slow"" advice (save for 40 years, retire at 65) is fundamentally broken. The book is intense, sometimes harsh, but it's the best reality check on wealth building I've ever read. He explains why your job will never make you rich and what actually will.

**Track every dollar like your life depends on it**

Sounds boring but this changed everything. I use **Monarch Money** to see exactly where money goes each month. Links all your accounts automatically and categorizes spending. Turns out I was hemorrhaging $340 monthly on subscriptions I forgot about and food delivery.

The app shows you patterns you can't see otherwise. Like how those $6 coffees actually add up to $180 monthly. Not saying cut everything out, just be conscious. That awareness alone helped me redirect $500 monthly toward investments instead of random stuff I don't remember buying.

**Learn actual financial literacy**

*I Will Teach You to Be Rich* by Ramit Sethi is the most practical money book that exists. Sethi breaks down the exact system for automating your finances, optimizing credit cards, and investing without being a finance bro. No guilt trips about lattes. Just a 6-week program that actually works. The title sounds scammy but it's legitimately the clearest guide to building wealth in your 20s and 30s. This book made me feel less stupid about money.

**BeFreed** is an AI learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers that transforms books, research papers, and expert content into personalized audio and structured learning plans. You type in what you want to learn, whether it's financial literacy, communication skills, or personal development, and it pulls from verified knowledge sources to create custom podcasts tailored to your goals.

What makes it different is the depth control. Start with a 10-minute summary of something like *The Millionaire Fastlane*, and if it clicks, switch to a 40-minute deep dive with actual examples and context. The voice options are legitimately addictive too, you can pick anything from a smooth, sexy narrator to something more energetic when you need focus during commutes or gym sessions. There's also a virtual coach that adapts your learning path based on what you engage with, making it feel less like consuming content and more like actual progress toward becoming the person you want to be.

Also binge **The Money Guy Show** podcast. Brian and Bo explain complex financial concepts like you're a normal human, not a Wall Street trader. Their episodes on the ""Financial Order of Operations"" basically gave me a roadmap for every dollar I earn.

**The gap between knowing and doing**

Here's the thing, information is everywhere. But most people consume content and do nothing with it. The difference between staying broke and building wealth isn't knowledge. It's actually implementing these systems consistently for years.

Autopilot is your friend. Set up the transfers, download the apps, start with whatever amount doesn't hurt. Even $50 per paycheck compounds into something real over time. The math doesn't care about your feelings.

You don't need to work 80-hour weeks or have some genius side hustle idea. You just need to treat money like a tool that works for you, not something that disappears every month. That mental shift alone is worth more than any raise.

1pznw3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolidMen/comments/1pznw3u/how_to_stop_being_a_midboyfriend/,How to Stop being a mid-boyfriend:,"# How to Stop Being a MID Boyfriend: Science-Based Tips That Actually Work

Been lurking relationship subs for a while and honestly? Most dudes think they're good boyfriends when they're really just... existing in a relationship. Not being actively terrible doesn't make you great, it makes you baseline. And a lot of relationship failures aren't because someone cheated or did something dramatic, they're death by a thousand small negligences.

Spent months going down rabbit holes, books, podcasts with actual relationship researchers (not just dating coaches), piecing together what actually separates mediocre relationships from the ones that last. This isn't about grand gestures or memorizing her coffee order. It's about understanding the psychological mechanics of what makes partnerships actually work.

**Bids for connection are everything.** Dr. John Gottman's research on this is wild. He studied thousands of couples and found that in relationships that lasted, partners responded to each other's ""bids"" (small requests for attention, affection, validation) 86% of the time. In relationships that failed? 33%. A bid is anything from ""look at this meme"" to ""I'm worried about my presentation tomorrow."" Most guys either miss these completely or give half assed responses while scrolling their phone. The magic isn't in always having the perfect response, it's in consistently turning toward your partner instead of away. **The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work** breaks this down in a way that's actually practical. Gottman has a 90% accuracy rate predicting divorce after watching couples for 15 minutes, btw. The book isn't some self help fluff, it's based on decades of actual lab research with couples. He introduces concepts like love maps (knowing your partner's inner world), building fondness and admiration systems, and managing conflict without destroying trust. Legitimately changed how I approach every interaction.

**Stop trying to fix everything.** Women don't always want solutions, they want to feel heard. This sounds like boomer advice your dad would give but there's actual neuroscience behind it. When someone vents, they're often just processing emotions out loud, not soliciting a 5 point action plan. Psychologist Guy Winch talks about this constantly. rushing to fix things can actually make your partner feel dismissed, like their emotions are a problem to solve rather than valid experiences to witness. Try this instead: ""That sounds really frustrating, tell me more"" or ""What do you need from me right now, just to listen or help think through options?"" Emotional attunement matters more than being right.

**Your phone is ruining your relationship.** Real talk, how often are you physically present but mentally elsewhere? Phubbing (phone snubbing) is linked to lower relationship satisfaction, increased conflict, and higher rates of depression in partners. It signals ""this device is more important than you"" even when you don't mean it that way. The **Gottman Institute Card Decks app** has conversation prompts that force you to actually engage. Sounds corny but it works. You sit down, no phones, and work through questions about dreams, stresses, appreciation. It's like a gym for relationship communication. Builds intimacy without feeling like forced therapy talk.

**Repair attempts are your cheat code.** You're going to fuck up, say something dismissive, forget something important, be irritable for no good reason. The couples who stay together aren't the ones who never fight, they're the ones who know how to repair damage quickly. A repair attempt is any gesture that prevents negativity from spiraling, a joke, an apology, a touch, anything that signals ""we're on the same team."" But here's the thing: your partner has to recognize it as a repair attempt. Which means you need to figure out what actually lands. For some people it's verbal (""I'm sorry, I was being a dick""), for others it's physical (a hug), for some it's acts of service (making them coffee the next morning). Learn their language.

**Emotional labor is invisible until you start doing it.** Remembering birthdays, noticing when household supplies are low, checking in on her friend who's going through a breakup, planning date nights, these things don't happen by magic. A ton of guys outsource all the relationship maintenance work to their partners then wonder why she's exhausted and resentful. Start tracking it. Who initiates difficult conversations? Who remembers to text during the day? Who plans things? Who notices when something's wrong? If it's always her, you're not being a partner, you're being managed. **How to Not Die Alone** by Logan Ury is great for this. She's a behavioral scientist who worked at Google and now does relationship coaching. Breaks down common patterns people fall into (romanticizer, maximizer, hesitater) and gives frameworks for building healthier habits. Tons of research backed insights about attachment styles, expectation management, and why people self sabotage. Made me realize I was operating on movie relationship logic instead of actual human psychology.

**BeFreed** is an AI learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized podcasts based on what you want to work on. Built by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers, so the content quality is solid. 

You can tell it specific goals like ""improve emotional intelligence in relationships"" or ""understand attachment theory,"" and it generates audio content tailored to that, anywhere from quick 10 minute overviews to 40 minute deep dives with examples. The adaptive learning plan adjusts based on your progress and what resonates with you. There's also a virtual coach you can chat with about relationship struggles or ask for book recommendations. 

The voice options are actually addictive, you can switch between different tones depending on your mood. Personally helps turn commute time or gym sessions into something productive instead of just zoning out.

**Differentiation is what keeps things alive long term.** Therapist David Schnarch writes about this. Basically, the healthiest relationships aren't enmeshed codependent situations where you do everything together and lose your individual identity. They're two whole people who maintain their own interests, friendships, goals while choosing to build something together. The paradox is that the more you can stand on your own, the more intimacy you're actually capable of because you're not using your partner to fill voids or manage your anxiety. Keep your hobbies, maintain your friendships, pursue personal growth. It makes you more interesting and takes pressure off the relationship to be your entire life.

**Conflict isn't the enemy, contempt is.** Gottman again, he identified four behaviors that predict breakup with scary accuracy: criticism, contempt, defensiveness, stonewalling. Contempt is the worst one, eye rolling, mockery, treating your partner like they're beneath you. It's poison. You can argue about dishes or schedules or whatever without being contemptuous. The moment you start viewing your partner with disgust or superiority, you're in dangerous territory. Check yourself when you feel that rising. What's underneath it? Usually your own insecurity or fear.

**Podcast rec:** Where Should We Begin with Esther Perel. You're literally listening to real couples therapy sessions (anonymous obviously). Perel is a psychotherapist who specializes in relationships and you hear her work through infidelity, sexless marriages, communication breakdowns, all of it in real time. It's like getting a masterclass in relationship dynamics without paying $300/hour for therapy. You start recognizing patterns in your own relationship, things you didn't even realize were issues.

Look, nobody teaches us this stuff. We're supposed to figure it out through trial and error and cultural osmosis from romcoms. But relationships are a skill set like anything else. The research exists, the frameworks exist, the tools exist. Most guys just don't seek them out because they think being a good boyfriend means not being a bad one. The bar is on the floor.

1pznw15,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pznw15/fearful_avoidant_breakup_advice_on_attraction/,Fearful avoidant Breakup Advice on attraction.,"I met a guy on app. For hookups. From the beginning, there was strong mutual attraction and sex was great. and later he asked me after 2 weeks if I would be open for something serious and I said yes.

we agreed we were both looking for something serious and monogamous. He asked me if i would be open to meet his parents someday. I told him, I am not out to my family and few straight friends, but I do have gay friends where I am fully out and would love him to be part of it. He said, he doesnt want to be part of my straight life but its ok with me to have two lives as long as i respect him. He was heading to.m back home in a month after we met, and he told me “i hope I dont loose you in the process of moving my place and going back home and i hope you will be patient  with me” I told him, I will wait for you as long as you give me a reason to wait for you, i dont want you to come back and say oh I dont feel the same anymore” then I dont want to waste my time. He said no, I am very much interested in you.

The first couple of months were intense but positive: frequent dates, weekly routine for 5 months amazing sexual chemistry, emotional openness, future-oriented conversations, and consistent effort from both sides. He often said things like we have so much “potential,” that I was “perfect for him, not just sexually bit our values matches, and that he wanted a long-term relationship. His parents marriage was a goal for him.

I asked him about his past relationships the first time he asked me out and From what he shared, his past relationships followed a similar pattern. He has dated people he felt strong attraction toward, but those relationships ended once deeper issues surfaced. In one case, he said he “fell out of love” after several months. In another, he ended things because he felt hidden or not fully chosen by his partner. He described having met “good guys” before but still feeling unsure.

Early on, we also had a very open conversation about expectations, communication, and past relationship insecurities. He said he appreciated the clarity and that it made him feel safe. Which he it took 6-7 months to get to this conversation in his past relationship.

Around month 3–4, things started to change. As the relationship became more emotionally real, he began expressing confusion about his feelings and whether he felt enough “spark” or attraction, even though his behavior (seeing each other regularly, initiating plans, sex, affection) largely stayed the same. He oscillated between wanting to keep trying and feeling overwhelmed.

I had to go back home as my mom was in hospital and this time, I asked him to be patient with me and he cried while I was leaving and he said yes I will wait.

When I came back after a week. He questioned the concern of me being closeted and He said he doesnt feel spark and butterflies. He broke up with me

I agreed to coming out to my parents in near future and assured him that I will not leave his side and I am serious about him. I even took a small step coming out to my roommate who is my very good friend to show my seriousness. We got back together

During this period, I became more anxious because of the inconsistency, while still trying to give space and be patient. He acknowledged he was confused, said something might be “wrong with him,” and that he wanted the relationship to work but didn’t know if he could give what I needed.

We broke up once, reconciled briefly, and then broke up again after about 5 months. During the final breakup, he said that although I was an “8/10” and a great partner, he felt life was too short not to look for a “10/10,” and that he wasn’t sure the attraction was enough long-term. He emphasized that I did nothing wrong.

After the breakup, he appeared calm and emotionally detached, returned to dating apps quickly, and blocked me there. When we met once for coffee. he was friendly and relaxed but firm that he didn’t want to continue. I, on the other hand, am struggling with a lot of grief, confusion, and hurt, especially around how someone could feel so certain after months of closeness.

There are much more details in this but this is the shortest I could write and try to fit major information. He was crying during these hard conversations and was seen overwhelmed and confused.

I tried my best to have soft and open communication and tried to show him we can work through and we can take things slow or the way he wants but he has to communicate rather end it.

I’m trying to understand whether this was mainly about attraction, emotional readiness, attachment differences, or something else — and how to make sense of the mismatch between how close the relationship felt and how decisively it ended.

I dont know what happened, it was all good. He even said even though he had longest relationship of 8 months with his ex. With me he had the smoothest non toxic relationship (5 months).

Trying to understand what happened,"I (22F) have been casually dating a guy (37M) for about 2.5 months. Yes, I know the age gap is significant !!!! I’m very aware of that now!!!

When we first matched, I questioned whether I should even meet him. I had never dated someone that much older, and I was concerned about being in very different life stages. On our first date, I remember actively reminding myself to take things slow and not project intentions that weren’t there. That said, the date lasted until the restaurant closed, conversation felt easy, and he came across as grounded and intentional, which eased some of my concerns at the time. Respected my boundaries  didn’t come off as “weird”. After that we started seeing each other regularly: a basketball game, a concert, dinners, etc. Communication was consistent at first — daily texts, good morning/good night messages, and him actively planning dates.

About a month in, we became intimate. This was a big deal for me, I had been celibate for about two years he was reassuring afterward. He also introduced me to his sisters, niece, and nephews, which made me feel like this wasn’t casual and that we were building toward something more intentional.

The first shift happened after I spent a full weekend at his place. We went out to eat and he became very sick. He was understandably miserable, but also noticeably irritable. The next morning he told me I could stay and explore the city while he rested. I did, and when I returned about an hour later, he seemed distant and said he’d been “worried” I was gone so long — which confused me, since he encouraged me to go out. The vibe felt off, so I left.

Around Thanksgiving, communication noticeably dropped. For about three days, he sent very dry, minimal texts. I didn’t push. Eventually I checked in, and he sent a long message explaining that a job opportunity fell through and he’d been very stressed and depressed. I understood and didn’t respond and I gave him space for about a week.

When I checked in again, he thanked me for giving him space, asked about my Thanksgiving, and suggested getting together the following week. I asked directly if everything was okay between us, and he reassured me that it was — explaining he was just overwhelmed with work stress.

That sudden pullback made me hesitant, so when he asked me out, I told him I’d let him know and didn’t fully engage. About a week later, he reached out again to see if we could spend time together, and I agreed.

We went on another date, and things seemed “normal” again briefly. But soon after, communication started drying up the same way. The last time I stayed over, the morning felt rushed — no coffee like usual, an urgency for me to leave, and my toothbrush (which I’d left there previously) appeared to be gone. He texted afterward asking if I made it home safely and sent a sunset photo, which felt oddly disconnected given the in-person energy.

Before Christmas, he asked about my flight and texted “safe flight” the morning I left. I liked the message but didn’t respond right away due to travel. The next day I sent him a photo from a hike — no response for three days. Then he sent a brief “Merry Christmas” text. I replied. After that, four more days passed with no follow-up or initiation from him.

At that point, I felt I needed clarity. Yesterday, I sent a simple message asking where his head is at with this. I haven’t received a response.

I’m trying to understand whether this is 
•a slow fade, 
•outright ghosting 
•or someone who likes me but doesn’t have the emotional availability to be consistent.

I’m less upset about things ending than I am confused by the lack of communication after weeks of intimacy and reassurance. Given his age, I honestly expected at least a clear “I’m not interested” response.",1,1767115189.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

I hope you all had a great Christmas! 

I recently got a Baratza Encore Esp to use with my vintage Gaggia Coffee Deluxe machine, but unfortunately I have spotted black flakes in my water, so I'm assuming the boiler is old and needs replacing). This leaves me with a bit of a dilemma. 

I already have a Wacaco Picopresso for travel, but the workflow isn't really ideal for daily use (it's a faff!!).

- Option 1: Use my picopresso for a few months until I can save for a better Espresso machine. 

- Option 2: Replace the boiler with a ~£40 uncoated aluminum one. I'm not super keen on this option because eventually I'll get black flakes again...

- Option 3: Replace the boiler with a ~£140 brass one, which I have heard is also better for temperature stability in the gaggia (since I don't have a PID installed).

I would really appreciate any advice you guys are able to give! If you think option 1 is the best, please feel free to recommend any easy workflow machines you can think of. Thank you 🙂",1,1767115182.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

He was a man whose name traveled faster than he did — stitched into labels, whispered in salons, printed beneath photographs of women who wore his clothes like armor. Wealth had made him untouchable, fame had made him unreal, and yet none of it could prevent the quiet, humiliating fact of a stalled engine on a forgotten road.

The car died without ceremony. No explosion, no drama—just a cough, a shudder, and silence. He tried once, then twice, then stepped out into a stretch of land that seemed to have misplaced itself on the map. Fields between forests and hills, a horizon that refused to offer answers. Somewhere in the distance, a town existed not because anyone had planned it, but because people had needed to stop moving.

He walked the rest of the way.

The town was small enough to feel accidental. A few buildings, a gas pump, a pub with a faded sign whose paint had given up years ago. Inside, time moved more slowly, as if it had nowhere urgent to be. The smell of fried food clung to the walls, and a radio hummed softly behind the bar. He stepped in not as a legend, but as a man who needed a phone and something warm to eat.

That was when she appeared.

She was not remarkable in the way magazines demanded. No careful polish, no cultivated mystery. Just young, tired in the way people get when they have never left where they were born, and beautiful in a way that felt almost unfair to the room she stood in. She wore a simple uniform, apron tied too tightly, hair pinned back with more effort than reward. When she spoke, it was with the practiced kindness of someone who had learned to be pleasant without being hopeful.

She took his order. She pointed him toward the phone. She noticed, without comment, that his suit did not belong in this place.

It was only later — between the coffee refills and the sound of his voice drifting through the receiver — that she understood who he was. Not because he announced it, but because men like him carried their gravity with them. When he asked about a mechanic, she gave him a name. When he asked how long it would take, she shrugged and said the truth: maybe today, maybe tomorrow. Things moved differently here.

He stayed.

They spoke in fragments at first. About the car. About the road. About how far the nearest city was. Then, gradually, about other things — things that did not belong to either of them but hovered anyway. He mentioned a runway delayed by an unexpected absence, a model who had vanished hours before she was meant to walk. He said it lightly, as if it were an inconvenience rather than a crack in a carefully controlled world. She listened, eyes sharp now, posture altered by interest she could not hide.

She asked what a runway was like. He told her.

Not in grand terms, but honestly — the lights, the music, the way a room could hold its breath. The way clothes could turn a person into someone unrecognizable, even to themselves. She laughed once, short and disbelieving, and said she had never owned anything beautiful that wasn’t meant for Sunday.

He looked at her then. Really looked.

The thought came to him fully formed and dangerous in its simplicity: she could do it. Not just wear the clothes, but inhabit them. She had a way of standing that suggested escape, a restlessness that no amount of small-town politeness could disguise. When he said as much, she went very still.

She did not ask if he was serious. She asked what would happen if she said yes.

He told her the truth, or at least the version of it he believed in: trains, cities, rooms full of strangers who would learn her face. Work that was not easy but was transformative. A chance that came once, if it came at all.

She told him she would go.

Not because of the clothes — though the thought of silk and cashmere made her smile — but because she had always known she would leave. This was simply the shape her leaving took. She said it plainly, as if stating a fact that had been waiting for the right witness.

There were only two conditions.

He could not let anyone from that town know where she went.
He could not bring her back.

The words were calm, but they carried the weight of something buried. Whatever waited for her beyond the pub’s door was not nostalgia. It was obligation, expectation, a life already decided. She wanted distance, not just miles but erasure.

He agreed.

The mechanic arrived near dusk. The car was fixed with unremarkable efficiency, hands blackened with grease, the problem resolved as quietly as it had appeared. Before she left with him, she asked for a little time. He waited at the edge of town while she walked the familiar road back to the farm where she had been raised.

The fields were loud with work when she arrived—her father and brother bent to their labor, backs turned, attention fixed on the earth that had claimed them long ago. No one saw her slip into the house. Inside, she moved quickly and without sentiment, gathering only what could be carried: a change of clothes, a small bundle of personal things, nothing that would slow her down or invite questions later. She did not write a note. There was no point in explaining an absence that had been inevitable for years.

When she left the farmhouse, she did so unseen, the door closing softly behind her. By the time the sun dipped low enough to stain the windows amber, she was back on the road. She climbed into the passenger seat of his car with her small bag at her feet and the certainty, now sharpened and irreversible, that she would never belong to that land again.

From the outside, it might have looked reckless. A powerful older man indulging a whim. A young woman mistaking opportunity for salvation. History would later reduce it to a footnote—a discovery, a muse, a lucky break. But from a distance wide enough to see the truth, it was something quieter and more exact.

It was a man whose world had been meticulously constructed, interrupted by chance. It was a woman who had been waiting for an interruption her entire life.

And somewhere between a broken-down car and a fading town, they both stepped off the path they were meant to follow—never looking back, and never saying each other’s names aloud, as if naming the moment might undo it.

I prefer F4M for this plot, where I’d play the female. You don’t have to be male yourself, just play the older gentleman! A quick note: My characters are usually petite and short. If that’s not your thing, we might not be a good match.

THIS WILL BE SET IN THE 1950s!!!

I love story-driven roleplays, especially slow-burn romances where characters grow and connect naturally. A 60/40 mix is my ideal, but I could also go for a 50/50 balance.

I’d prefer someone literate. I usually write quite a lot and in a very detailed manner, so don’t bother me for one-liners! Adv-Lit to Novella is preferred! Also, 3rd person only, please. I have more than 10 years of experience in roleplay, so I know what I’m looking for in a roleplay partner!

Additionally, I would really like it if you played a reference I will be providing! Just as your character’s face/body claim! If not, do keep in mind that I’m very picky about my partner’s character’s appearance!

And please note: I only want to be contacted by adults (18 years and older). If you’ve read all this, include the word ‘Bubble’ in your message! (｀_´)ゞ (I won’t be responding to messages without it!) ",1,1767115127.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

I'm a french solo UI/UX designer in learning process, and a Flutter developer.

**I've built a mobile app to solve a problem I've noticed in many subreddits a month ago :** 

**Finding people to play with, in a specific way (for games that offers multiple & different activities) IN REAL TIME.** Because yes, many subreddits exists only for sharing your platforms IDs/or friend codes if you're using Nintendo consoles. Or you can search for a game specific server on Discord. But the problem is the same : 

Let's say you ask for people to play with you. **You have 3 major conditions to meet :** 

\- It's better if you are in the same time zone  
\- People answer in a maximum of approximatively 15 min, otherwise you go for another activity or you're simply not available anymore.  
\- People are in the same mood and vibe than you, and you want to do the same activity in the specific game.

The problem with Reddit, Discord, or any other social network in general, is that, even when you download the corresponding mobile apps, and enable the notifications, these apps are so full of features and full of informations, that it can be overwhelming to check for that specific notification that show you the players's answers, even if they are really reactive.

So, i first checked out if there's an existing app and didn't found it by myself or even with AI, and that was curious because after i've developed my app, someone that joined my community talked about GamerLink but the interface wasnt friendly and has a subscription plan for all the main features (didnt verified yet but he described me the app like this.).

So I thought about the fact that I'll have only one competitor, and maybe I could play on the ""community"" side, a family vibe, even retro (I love retro and analogic design)

**SO here's a short description of my app, because I also leave here the google description because it's better written (not AI but got helped with translators because my english is not perfect for specific terms) :** 

\- Register your IDs/Usernames corresponding to the platforms you want to use (Steam, Nintendo, Oculus, etc)

\- Create a specific game lobby and platforms (you have the 5 last nintendo platforms, modern consoles, PC, and even VR !) and specify the maximum desired number of players, and add a description so people already know what you want to do il the lobby.  
  
\- Join existing game lobbies (it works like a social network feed but you can search for a specific game if existing), you press a button to ask the host before joining.

\- In the lobby, you'll see players and their corresponding IDs for the specific platform. You can add them to play later and invite them into your futures lobbies.

\- In-lobby chat, it's only text for the moment but I'll see if I create vocal chat or if people prefer to go in another platform to voice chat.

\- Your profile page, where you register your different IDs, your profile picture, and your 10 most played/favorites games atm (useful for notifications).

**Okay for the features, but what's the advantage over the other social networks ? NOTIFICATIONS :**

\- Get notified when someone's wants to join your lobby so he doesn't wait for hours.  
\- Get notified if the host accepted your request to join, so you click on the notification and see the lobby, chat etc instantly.  
\- Get notified when you received a new message (basic but wanted to mention)   
\- Get notified when a friend invite you to a lobby, this way you bypass the host authorization and join the action immediatly.  
\- the most useful notification : Get notified when someone create a lobby corresponding to one of your favorite games, so you don't miss any potential session.

**Furthermore, a massive feature upcoming :** 

Not everyone but, most of the people that spend a huge amount of their time in video-games, above loving what they are playing, are introverts. I was introvert when I was a teenager, but it changed over time (and I think working on a bar for some time really change you ahah, but out of context.)

I also see and read many stories about people getting in love with distant people. That is sometimes cool and romantic, but It can be really frustrating, furthermore if you actually are a teenager. 

**That's why I want to create a feature called Cross&Play :** 

Using passive Bluetooth, your phone will yield your Username/or in-app ID, and, if you cross someone in the street using the app, your phone will get a notification and at the end of the day (not before, it's really important to avoid weird situations in the street), a new page will be available, to see all the people you came by during the day. 

You'll see basic informations about the player (his username, his favorites games), but also a short description that was written by the user and only available for people that cross him/she of himself and a few things he/she likes in life, in general. 

This could be a really good conversation start and maybe people could meet and have a coffee, and a good relationship ! 

This feature would be under extreme security rules (to avoid harrassment, kidnapping, etc), for example people would need to register their IDs cards only for security purpose so if there's any incident in the app or out of the app, the autorities would be able to gather the essential informations quickly enough. Furthermore, if a player is 25 years old, he would not be able to see informations about a player who is under 18.

But I really do think it could be a good feature for introverts.  
\-------------------------------------------------------------

**Price :** 

# IT'S FREE

**Website, app download & more :** 

So the app is actually in beta phase, available for Android users (I'm gathering 100 dollars so I can buy an Apple license and publish the beta for iOS users, I think I'll do that in 2 months).

We are 6 active users for the moment, for a total of 22 testers but I think not everyone has downloaded the app yet. 

Most of the current users are playing 3ds & Switch games but personally I play every possible platforms (except Sony & Microsoft that I don't have)

I have good feedbacks for now, I've already corrected the biggest bugs, and now we just need more players because this app is based on the amount of the lobbies ahah.

**Here's the complete Google play app's description, with all the features :**

\-------------------------------------------------------------

""Find the best mates to play your way !

DingPlay helps you find the right people to play with, no matter the game or the platform.

Tired of jumping between servers, forums, and social networks just to find someone who plays the same game, on the same platform, with the same goals? DingPlay was built to make this simple, fast, and stress-free.

# Create or join game lobbies

Create a lobby for a specific game and platform, describe exactly what you want to do (casual, competitive, co-op, ranked, chill sessions, etc.), and let other players join you.  
You can also browse existing lobbies and instantly join players who match your expectations.

# Chat and connect easily

Each lobby comes with a built-in chat, allowing you to talk with players before and during your session.  
Once you’ve had a great game together, add players to your friends list and play again anytime.

# Favorite games & smart notifications

Add up to 10 of your favorite or most played games.  
Whenever someone creates a lobby for a game in your favorites list, you’ll receive a notification so you never miss a good opportunity to play.

# Stay informed

Get notified when:

* Someone wants to join your lobby
* Your invitation is accepted
* You receive new chat messages
* A new lobby is created for one of your favorite games

# Play without pressure

DingPlay is also perfect if you’re shy or uncomfortable joining large servers or social networks.  
Instead of searching and introducing yourself over and over again, DingPlay helps players find *you*, based on what you want to play and how you want to play.

No awkward introductions. No wasted time.  
Just launch DingPlay, find your mates, and enjoy your game.""",1,1767115030.0,MobileAppDevelopers,0,1.0,False

1pznpmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheAngel/comments/1pznpmu/the_most_common_signs_that_a_reddit_story_might/,The most common signs that a Reddit story might most likely be fake,"● They have a very robotic way of writing. They usually read more as something that ChatGPT would write rather than an actual story being told by a person

● Weird timeframes, stuff that seems like it happened longer than the OP says. For example, if someone in their story gets arrested, they're usually tried and convicted in only a few weeks

● The OP is usually treated as a perfect individual. They are usually portrayed as kind, talented, always calm, and always in the right who just so happens to have everything documented. Any flaws they have or times where they're clearly in the wrong are always brushed to the side and ignored. They can act like the human equivalent of garbage and still be written like they're the good guy in the situation

● The people who are against OP are portrayed as a bunch of mustache-twirling, entitled, constantly smirking, overly confident bad guys who just hate OP and whose whole life revolves around them making their life miserable. With almost everyone being on their side. Like they wouldn't be out of place in a Saturday morning cartoon. They're usually written as such to make the OP look better

● Most stories are clearly ragebait. The main villain is usually in a minority, and the story has them act as outlandishly awful as possible to demonize certain groups and get people angry or enforce harmful stereotypes. Some popular examples I've noticed are step parents/siblings, LGBTQA+ people, autistic people, disabled people, people who aren't conventionally attractive, MIL's, Christians, women who are struggling with fertility and the list goes on

● LOTS of tropes. Entitled/abusive parent, golden child sibling, OP eventually runs a successful business, OP just so happens to walk into an area at the perfect time to hear a group talk about important information, multiple mentions of documenting, ""my phone's been blowing up"" just to name a few

● The dialog is pretty clunkily, robotic, and awkward, it comes across as how an amateur writer would write dialog rather than how people actually talk

● They're detailed, like OVERALLEY so. They have multiple direct quotes from different people, give people names even when there's no point to it, they repeat themselves and events as a way to drag the story out as much as possible. They even write down what exactly they eat or drink, as if it were apparently important to know that OP had coffee and blueberry pancakes for breakfast

● They share a lot of the same way of writing and a lot of events, names, objects, and even exact lines are almost identical to each other, a pretty clear sign that they're either using ChatGPT or copying each other. Take a shot whenever you hear the line ""a stern woman named (put name here)""  or ""I document everything"" or ""my hands were shaking"" and don't forget the one and only Mrs/Mr Henderson and or Mrs/Mr Chen who just so happens be in everyone's story. Oh and don't forget the tracking app that every bad guy seems to put on the OP's phone

● Inconsistencies galore. There was this one story I read when the OOP had to pretend she was pregnant for her sister because the sister was the black sheep basically. But then, suddenly, OOP talked about how the sister was actually the golden child. Again another clear sign that it's written by AI

● The titles are written in a way to be the most attention-grabbing and eye-catching as possible. Usually along the lines of ""at 8 months pregnant I stubbed my toe, my sister snapped ""this is all your fault you pathetic waste of space"" I saw my husband laughing behind her while I was on the floor, he put his arm around her and smirked ""yeah and btw I'm smooching your sister, drained out your bank account, sold the house and will be flying off to Hawaii to start a new life"" My parents nodded ""we also sold your dog and all your stuff because we hate your existence for no reason"" My uncle nodded ""some people just deserve to stub their toe and have their life ruined for no reason"" I just nodded and made a few phone calls. That was a week ago, now they're on their knees begging for forgiveness""

● The accounts that post them are usually either brand new or have multiple other stories that are completely different

● ""And then everyone clapped""",24,1767114834.0,AmITheAngel,24,0.85,False

He comes and visits for a weekend through the next weekend maybe every 5-6 weeks. Occasionally I go to him or he comes for just a few days. My roommate has a problem with this. Right now she is on Christmas break as a teacher and he has work off as well. She said she didn’t want him there during the day when I’m at work. I understand where she’s coming from but it’s also my Christmas break from school and I still have to work full time. She wanted him out of the apartment and I tried to compromise and have him leaving the apartment to hang out in the community room from 10:30am until I get home from work at 2:30pm. Also we are sleeping at my parents for a night to be out of the apartment. I feel uncomfortable having him in my own home. I am so tense the entirety that she is home or watching tv in the common area. We are not loud, and she has said she doesn’t know why it bothers her when we are just in my room watching a movie. I have my own room and connected bathroom and my boyfriend is afraid to leave it now. I have given her a decrease in utilities when he visits for the 9 days.
Also, to note I have mixed feelings about this because my roommate brings home one night stands and men frequently. Maybe once every two weeks. There is a lot of tension with my boyfriend and roommate because she brought home a one night stand and I woke up with him naked in my bed. Very traumatic. I have a lock on my door now that I lock every night. I can accept this is her home too and she can do what she likes. My boyfriend doesn’t go to the common room, especially when I’m not there. I don’t know what to do I’m trying but I don’t have a lot of options and it’s causing tension in my relationship with both of them. She says I don’t spend time with her when he’s here, but she is the one with a huge social life and I’m introverted.
It seems to be okay right now but there is tension. My poor boyfriend feels homeless and goes to a coffee shop and the community room. I just feel bad. All he wants to do is relax in my bed and read or watch a program with headphones.

I KNOW what the tik tok sleep specialists would have to say about that and I don’t care!! I also let myself fall asleep at 7:30pm when I get sleepy, let myself wake up from 12-1am naturally and then fall back asleep 1-5:30am. Is this a trend? No! Does it work for me? Yes! 

 If you find yourself asking if something is bad or okay, instead ask yourself: Does it help me sleep? Does it work for me? 

Sleep is not one size fits all, and everyone’s body chemistries are so different!! I know people who drink a cup of coffee and knock out! I know others (me) who drink a cup of coffee and are up for 3 days straight. 

Tune into yourself and stop listening to random nutritionists and fake professionals 

If it helps you sleep, keep doing it! Barring really self destructive methods of course

Sending everyone soothing thoughts today!! Anxiety is a killer but I am hoping you all get a glorious night of sleep tonight🩷",2,1767114624.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

1pznlph,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1pznlph/dingplay_a_mobile_app_to_help_you_find_players_in/,Dingplay - A mobile app to help you find players in REAL TIME,"# Hey guys! Welcome to Dingplay !

I'm a french solo UI/UX designer in learning process, and a Flutter developer.

**I've built a mobile app to solve a problem I've noticed in many subreddits a month ago :** 

**Finding people to play with, in a specific way (for games that offers multiple & different activities) IN REAL TIME.** Because yes, many subreddits exists only for sharing your platforms IDs/or friend codes if you're using Nintendo consoles. Or you can search for a game specific server on Discord. But the problem is the same : 

Let's say you ask for people to play with you. **You have 3 major conditions to meet :** 

\- It's better if you are in the same time zone  
\- People answer in a maximum of approximatively 15 min, otherwise you go for another activity or you're simply not available anymore.  
\- People are in the same mood and vibe than you, and you want to do the same activity in the specific game.

The problem with Reddit, Discord, or any other social network in general, is that, even when you download the corresponding mobile apps, and enable the notifications, these apps are so full of features and full of informations, that it can be overwhelming to check for that specific notification that show you the players's answers, even if they are really reactive.

So, i first checked out if there's an existing app and didn't found it by myself or even with AI, and that was curious because after i've developed my app, someone that joined my community talked about GamerLink but the interface wasnt friendly and has a subscription plan for all the main features (didnt verified yet but he described me the app like this.).

So I thought about the fact that I'll have only one competitor, and maybe I could play on the ""community"" side, a family vibe, even retro (I love retro and analogic design)

**SO here's a short description of my app, because I also leave here the google description because it's better written (not AI but got helped with translators because my english is not perfect for specific terms) :** 

\- Register your IDs/Usernames corresponding to the platforms you want to use (Steam, Nintendo, Oculus, etc)

\- Create a specific game lobby and platforms (you have the 5 last nintendo platforms, modern consoles, PC, and even VR !) and specify the maximum desired number of players, and add a description so people already know what you want to do il the lobby.  
  
\- Join existing game lobbies (it works like a social network feed but you can search for a specific game if existing), you press a button to ask the host before joining.

\- In the lobby, you'll see players and their corresponding IDs for the specific platform. You can add them to play later and invite them into your futures lobbies.

\- In-lobby chat, it's only text for the moment but I'll see if I create vocal chat or if people prefer to go in another platform to voice chat.

\- Your profile page, where you register your different IDs, your profile picture, and your 10 most played/favorites games atm (useful for notifications).

**Okay for the features, but what's the advantage over the other social networks ? NOTIFICATIONS :**

\- Get notified when someone's wants to join your lobby so he doesn't wait for hours.  
\- Get notified if the host accepted your request to join, so you click on the notification and see the lobby, chat etc instantly.  
\- Get notified when you received a new message (basic but wanted to mention)   
\- Get notified when a friend invite you to a lobby, this way you bypass the host authorization and join the action immediatly.  
\- the most useful notification : Get notified when someone create a lobby corresponding to one of your favorite games, so you don't miss any potential session.

**Furthermore, a massive feature upcoming :** 

Not everyone but, most of the people that spend a huge amount of their time in video-games, above loving what they are playing, are introverts. I was introvert when I was a teenager, but it changed over time (and I think working on a bar for some time really change you ahah, but out of context.)

I also see and read many stories about people getting in love with distant people. That is sometimes cool and romantic, but It can be really frustrating, furthermore if you actually are a teenager. 

**That's why I want to create a feature called Cross&Play :** 

Using passive Bluetooth, your phone will yield your Username/or in-app ID, and, if you cross someone in the street using the app, your phone will get a notification and at the end of the day (not before, it's really important to avoid weird situations in the street), a new page will be available, to see all the people you came by during the day. 

You'll see basic informations about the player (his username, his favorites games), but also a short description that was written by the user and only available for people that cross him/she of himself and a few things he/she likes in life, in general. 

This could be a really good conversation start and maybe people could meet and have a coffee, and a good relationship ! 

This feature would be under extreme security rules (to avoid harrassment, kidnapping, etc), for example people would need to register their IDs cards only for security purpose so if there's any incident in the app or out of the app, the autorities would be able to gather the essential informations quickly enough. Furthermore, if a player is 25 years old, he would not be able to see informations about a player who is under 18.

But I really do think it could be a good feature for introverts.  
\-------------------------------------------------------------

**Price :** 

# IT'S FREE

**Website, app download & more :** 

So the app is actually in beta phase, available for Android users (I'm gathering 100 dollars so I can buy an Apple license and publish the beta for iOS users, I think I'll do that in 2 months).

We are 6 active users for the moment, for a total of 22 testers but I think not everyone has downloaded the app yet. 

Most of the current users are playing 3ds & Switch games but personally I play every possible platforms (except Sony & Microsoft that I don't have)

I have good feedbacks for now, I've already corrected the biggest bugs, and now we just need more players because this app is based on the amount of the lobbies ahah.

# So if you want to join the adventure, here's the website for the app : [https://www.dingplay.net/](https://www.dingplay.net/)

**Here's the complete Google play app's description, with all the features :**

\-------------------------------------------------------------

""Find the best mates to play your way !

DingPlay helps you find the right people to play with, no matter the game or the platform.

Tired of jumping between servers, forums, and social networks just to find someone who plays the same game, on the same platform, with the same goals? DingPlay was built to make this simple, fast, and stress-free.

# Create or join game lobbies

Create a lobby for a specific game and platform, describe exactly what you want to do (casual, competitive, co-op, ranked, chill sessions, etc.), and let other players join you.  
You can also browse existing lobbies and instantly join players who match your expectations.

# Chat and connect easily

Each lobby comes with a built-in chat, allowing you to talk with players before and during your session.  
Once you’ve had a great game together, add players to your friends list and play again anytime.

# Favorite games & smart notifications

Add up to 10 of your favorite or most played games.  
Whenever someone creates a lobby for a game in your favorites list, you’ll receive a notification so you never miss a good opportunity to play.

# Stay informed

Get notified when:

* Someone wants to join your lobby
* Your invitation is accepted
* You receive new chat messages
* A new lobby is created for one of your favorite games

# Play without pressure

DingPlay is also perfect if you’re shy or uncomfortable joining large servers or social networks.  
Instead of searching and introducing yourself over and over again, DingPlay helps players find *you*, based on what you want to play and how you want to play.

No awkward introductions. No wasted time.  
Just launch DingPlay, find your mates, and enjoy your game.""",1,1767114590.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

And the UK by far, is one of the cheapest countries to buy food I've been. I'll explain why bel","When I say £95, it might seem a lot to you...
But for me, it's quite cheap. I'll tell you why. 
In the UK, on minimum wage, it takes one person 1 working day, about 8-9 hours to make £94 after taxes. 

And many items on this photo I bought, were imported like the NIDO can, acai packs or puck spread hence more than expensive too. 

I spend around £160 a week for food for 2 people when I'm in the UK. That would be almost 2 days of work 16-18 hours on minimum wage to buy food for 2 people for one week. Sure I can buy even cheaper! If I wanted to replace some brands, which I don't. 

In Brazil, those same items that cost £94 for me here in the UK and 1 day of work to earn, those items would cost the equivalent of £70, which might seem cheaper at first look.

But it's WAY WAY more expensive. Simply because in Brazil, to earn £70 to buy this food,  one would need to work about 55 HOURS on minimum wage to buy those items. That's almost 10x more than the UK. Bearing in mind, in Brazil all of those items that I got imported in the UK, are actually not imported in Brazil  as they are all produced locally. 

This is not only with fancy food like this, any food. In average one would need to work. 5-10x more to buy the same we have in the UK. 

I've traveled to over 12 countries around Europe too and the UK is among the cheapest for food in relation to local wages. Portugal per example, i found things quite expensive when I heard they got paid 800-1000 euros per month on a minimum wage 

While many complain about the rise in inflation, trust me, it still way way better than most countries. 

This post is more like so people can open their eyes a bit and be thankful for what they have, as it's not perfect but it's much better than many places. ",43,1767114442.0,whatsinyourcart,28,0.87,False

1pznes9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1pznes9/divorce_or_reconnect/,Divorce or Reconnect?,"Need advice. 

• I’m 41M, wife 42F
• Have been together for 21 years 
• Two kids (ages 8 and 3) - boys
• On paper we are very successful. Sold a business. Have a beautiful ranch in the mountains in Oregon and a stunning Villa on the beach in Mexico.
• Connection has completely faded since we had our second child. 

Everything is about domestic duties and going through the motions. We no longer thrive. We talk about just surviving the days. Neither of us seemingly want to live alone or put the kids through a divorce. We have both done things to hurt each other. Both caused trauma. Our kids are beautiful and happy and wrestle and play together. Finances aren’t a stressed but they come up a lot. Wife wants to start another business. I support her. I recently lost my father (he passed away in his sleep), and she was not there for me at all. I struggle with grief to this day. We parent differently. We’ve tried couples counseling. We both have therapists. All of the “stuff.” We try and do it. 

We still seem to resent each other and question whether we are truly happy or not. I do not get any affection from my wife at all. We don’t talk about deep subjects. We not longer have morning coffee, go on hikes, travel around like we used to before kids. 

It seems like we are both just scared of getting divorced and starting over, and putting more pain on the kids. However, we aren’t modeling affection or true love for the boys. They don’t see us hug or kiss. They don’t see us go out on date nights. She is a dismissive avoidant. I am anxiously attached. I am wildly insecure and have body dysmorphia. She tells me that I look good and am handsome in her eyes, but she never even comes so close as to hold my hand, sit next to me, or anything. Nothing. Just stone cold. 

I need affection, warmth, conversational banter, etc. I have a very active mind and am always thinking, dreaming, wondering about various things. 

Kids are thriving still. 8 year old is accelerating in 2nd grade. 3 year old is a bundle of happiness. 

I am terrified of growing old with her and entering our mid-40’s in such an empty marriage without any depth. Sex seems like an eternity away because neither of us want to be vulnerable with each other anymore. 

What do I do? Do I power through the next few years for the sake of the kids and hope and pray for a reconnection? Do I ask her daily/weekly to reconnect? Do I start thinking about moving on and finding someone else who is better suited for what I am looking for as I enter the second half of my life? I am so lost with what to do. So is she. This is why we just go through the motions and never seem to make any traction uphill. 

We are both very smart intellectually. Not so much emotionally. We are stuck. 

Is it worth it to stick it out for the kids? We seem to have gotten through the nasty years with both of them. I’m worried as they get older with more intense emotions and complex situations in their lives (childhood friendships, puberty, etc), the kids are going to see and feel how us parents aren’t affectionate towards each other. 

Anybody else been through this? What did you do? I really don’t want to lose her. I don’t think I would survive being alone, let alone seeing with another man. Just the thought of it makes me sick. 

I just need someone to hold my hand every once in a while. The holidays are tough without my father. He was my best friend. She doesn’t seem to care. 

Any advice?

1pzndld,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1pzndld/should_i_cancel/,Should I cancel?,"Connected with a guy a few weeks ago. It's the holidays, so he couldn't meet immediately. Seems reasonable. 

He asked for a phone call, I countered with a video chat. We didn't do either. Last week, He suggested ""coffee or lunch this Friday"" (over a week later). I said sure, and to let me know what time worked. He didn't. 

He followed up this weekend to ask if we were still on for Friday. I said sure, ""what time?"" He said ""Let's do morning coffee."" I followed up to tell him I was scheduling meetings for Friday and needed to know the time. I suggested early, and asked him to confirm. He said he could ""probably"" do that if the location is convenient. I suggested some places. 

Now, I'm an overeducated single mom closer to 50 than 40, and I don't seem to connect with lots of men, or get to the point of meeting. So I'm torn. 

I should cancel though, right? I'm annoyed before even getting to the starting point. ",6,1767114075.0,datingoverforty,36,1.0,False
1pzncxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1pzncxo/my_husband_changed_when_we_got_married_i_want_a/,My husband changed when we got married. I want a divorce but am worried about his SI.,"I’ve been married for four months. I know - such a short time to be considering this. Everything was great before we got married but have now turned sour. It’s like he did a 180 on me - taking off the mask and showing who he truly is. I want to leave but am so scared he will hurt himself.

A little about my husband: he has two prior failed marriages with two kids from his first marriage. The kids live full time with us as their mother lives out of state. My husband has had a hard life growing up in an abusive household, DV with a couple exes, and cheating with nearly all his prior relationships. He struggles with depression, anxiety, PTSD and has had suicidal attempts prior to our relationship. I knew all of this prior to our marriage but he didn’t have any issues while we were dating and was very open about his feelings in a healthy manner and agreed to therapy if it was ever necessary. 

Once we got married, things began taking a turn for the worst. It seemed like his anxiety peaked. All of a sudden, it began being a problem if I was on my phone. He’d constantly be asking me what I was doing, looking over my shoulder, getting pissed if I was on any social media platforms. He made me delete any male friends on social media, any messages with men (even inactive messages dating back to early 2000’s), and photos (including untagging myself from other peoples’ photos). I was also no longer allowed to post self portraits because “I didn’t need to seek attention from other guys”. He told me he didn’t believe men and women could just be friends. I, even, had to cut off my family friends from childhood. There was no compromise. He would have even preferred I’d delete all my social medias because HE didn’t have them. He deleted them because he would obsess over my profiles. He could not get over the fact that I had relationships before him. I’m secretly using my phone to type this as we speak.

He also began having problems with me going out. Every time I would arrange plans with my friends or family, it would cause a fight. I wasn’t allowed to drink, dress cute, wasn’t allowed to stay out late or for too long, needed to be in constant contact with him, and keep my phone with me so he could track my location. He would tell my 11 year old step daughter (also has severe anxiety) horrible things like, “she’s leaving us and never coming back.” Or, “she’s going to break our hearts like everyone else. She doesn’t love us. She’s going to find someone else.” I told him that was inappropriate to do but he would continue to act this way. When I’d get home, we’d always fight because I always did something wrong in his eyes. I have only been out with my friends 3 times and 3 times with my mom since July. He constantly acts like I am out all the time. He doesn’t believe in friendships being important, so expects me to follow suit.

We have worked together since before we were  together. I have always been a very outgoing talkative person. I was friends with everyone at work. Once we got married, he’d get jealous over simple conversations - even those which were necessary for work. He’d get pissy if someone even said a simple “hello” to me. I had to stay isolating myself at work to avoid the constant jealousy and fighting.

Lastly, he began being so lazy. When dating, he would help with cooking and keeping the house clean. He would do things for me like make a cup of coffee for me in the morning. Now, I do all the cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, etc. when he does cook, it’s only for himself. He bitches and complains if I ask him to do anything and will do a half-assed job (I.e. taking the trash out but not taking recycling and replacing the bag, doing the dishes but leaving hand washed items for me to clean, doing the laundry and throwing the clean clothes on the couch for me to fold). We do the same job and work the same hours but he can’t be bothered to lift a finger. Instead, he sits on the couch and plays video games all day. I also entertain, tutor and take care of the kids. The only time he spends with the kids is at dinner or when he wants them to sit down and watch a movie. All he ever wants to do is sit on the couch and watch TV or play video games. We hardly get out of the house uncles going to work/school. He doesn’t like me to be away from him and doesn’t want to go out - so it’s hard to get the kids out to do fun stuff on the weekends.

With all of this, I’ve become so mentally exhausted and resentful. He’s CONSTANTLY nitpicking me (I.e. I don’t look happy enough, I’m on my phone, I don’t touch him enough, I’m too quiet, I’m too loud, I have attitude, I’m not spending enough time with him, etc.) If I defend myself, try to explain my feelings or clear up any misunderstandings, he claims I’m putting the blame on him for everything and brings up his suicidal thoughts. It’s gotten to the point that I either have to just sit there and take his constant criticism or not sleep that night due to his threats to leave me and his kids in the middle of the night to go kill himself. We had one fight where he accidentally slammed a chair and bruised my patella. When I cried from the pain, he pulled a loaded gun and tried to walk out the door with it. I had to stand in his way and pull the gun out of his hand while his teenage son was just an earshot away in his bedroom. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I want to leave but am so scared he’s going to kill himself if I do. He continues to tell me, “you’re going to leave me like everyone else.” “Everyone will be better off without me.” “You make me the happiest I’ve ever been. I can’t live in a world without you.”

I am at the point of despising him. I’m with him 24/7 and am not in a good place mentally. I’m so drained and feel I need to continue an act he hardly believes. I’m also worried about leaving/traumatizing these kids who have already dealt with so much trauma seeing their dad’s prior suicide attempt and dealing with abusive ex-stepmother/girlfriends. Bottom line - this was not the man I thought I’d married. I feel manipulated and trapped. Can anyone give me advise for how to move forward with a divorce? I can’t keep living like this. If you’ve made it this far, I appreciate your time and value your opinion. Thanks!

1pznbkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosting/comments/1pznbkv/slow_fade_or_ghosting_trying_to_understand_what/,slow fade or ghosting? Trying to understand what happened,"I (22F) have been casually dating a guy (37M) for about 2.5 months. Yes, I know the age gap is significant !!!! I’m very aware of that now!!!

When we first matched, I questioned whether I should even meet him. I had never dated someone that much older, and I was concerned about being in very different life stages. On our first date, I remember actively reminding myself to take things slow and not project intentions that weren’t there. That said, the date lasted until the restaurant closed, conversation felt easy, and he came across as grounded and intentional, which eased some of my concerns at the time. Respected my boundaries  didn’t come off as “weird”. After that we started seeing each other regularly: a basketball game, a concert, dinners, etc. Communication was consistent at first — daily texts, good morning/good night messages, and him actively planning dates.

About a month in, we became intimate. This was a big deal for me, I had been celibate for about two years he was reassuring afterward. He also introduced me to his sisters, niece, and nephews, which made me feel like this wasn’t casual and that we were building toward something more intentional.

The first shift happened after I spent a full weekend at his place. We went out to eat and he became very sick. He was understandably miserable, but also noticeably irritable. The next morning he told me I could stay and explore the city while he rested. I did, and when I returned about an hour later, he seemed distant and said he’d been “worried” I was gone so long — which confused me, since he encouraged me to go out. The vibe felt off, so I left.

Around Thanksgiving, communication noticeably dropped. For about three days, he sent very dry, minimal texts. I didn’t push. Eventually I checked in, and he sent a long message explaining that a job opportunity fell through and he’d been very stressed and depressed. I understood and didn’t respond and I gave him space for about a week. 

When I checked in again, he thanked me for giving him space, asked about my Thanksgiving, and suggested getting together the following week. I asked directly if everything was okay between us, and he reassured me that it was — explaining he was just overwhelmed with work stress.

That sudden pullback made me hesitant, so when he asked me out, I told him I’d let him know and didn’t fully engage. About a week later, he reached out again to see if we could spend time together, and I agreed.

We went on another date, and things seemed “normal” again briefly. But soon after, communication started drying up the same way. The last time I stayed over, the morning felt rushed — no coffee like usual, an urgency for me to leave, and my toothbrush (which I’d left there previously) appeared to be gone. He texted afterward asking if I made it home safely and sent a sunset photo, which felt oddly disconnected given the in-person energy.

Before Christmas, he asked about my flight and texted “safe flight” the morning I left. I liked the message but didn’t respond right away due to travel. The next day I sent him a photo from a hike — no response for three days. Then he sent a brief “Merry Christmas” text. I replied. After that, four more days passed with no follow-up or initiation from him.

At that point, I felt I needed clarity. Yesterday, I sent a simple message asking where his head is at with this. I haven’t received a response.

I’m trying to understand whether this is:
	•	a slow fade,
	•	outright ghosting,
	•	or someone who likes me but doesn’t have the emotional availability to be consistent.

I’m less upset about things ending than I am confused by the lack of communication after weeks of intimacy and reassurance. Given his age, I honestly expected at least a clear “I’m not interested” response.",2,1767113958.0,ghosting,1,0.75,False

Robert with Air Groove: Air Groove, if Rudolph tells another lame joke, shove this twinkle down her throat. That's verbal harassment, and you don't have to take it. Air Groove's mood suddenly shoots up.

Robert with Super Creek: Super Creek, I don't need you to mother me. I already have Blonde Blazer for that.

Robert with Super Creek again: You know, you could work in an orphanage and take care of the children in there instead of playing goo goo babies with every  random ass full grown dude you see right?

Robert with Haru Urara: Haru, I love you, you're an absolute sweet heart, and I know you're very passionate about racing, but seriously girl, you are the slowest uma I've ever seen in my life, and probably the slowest of all time. Like seriously, I swear some days I see you running backwards on the track. Like I don't want to hurt your feelings or anything, but you really should find another career.

Robert with Rice Shower, Rice, fuck the haters. Don't beat yourself up for doing your job. You're a great race horse and no one has the right to take that away from you. If people have a problem with you beating their favorite speed pony, tell them to piss off. And whatever you're doing, keep it up.

Robert with Goldship: Goldship, I know that you're the most talented and gifted woman on the planet, and that you can do anything and everything that you put your mind into, but that's the problem, you don't put your mind into anything. You literally go from one thing to the next on a damn heartbeat. Girl! Focus on one thing at a time! And the one thing you should be focusing on is racing!

Like aren't you worry that you're top and/or bottom might break off during a race  leaving you more naked than what you are now?

Maru: What, I'm fine! Besides, plenty of other girls wear outfits as revealing as this.

Ever looked at your bank account and thought, *""If I just had a little more, I’d finally feel secure""*? Here’s the truth: **Most of us are sitting on way more financial power than we realize—we’re just not using it the right way.**

Think about it:
- That $5 coffee you grab daily? **$1,825 a year.**
- The unused gym membership? **$600+ down the drain.**
- The ""just in case"" savings sitting in a low-interest account? **Potentially thousands in lost growth.**

Money isn’t just about *having* it—it’s about **making it work for you.** And the best part? You don’t need a finance degree to start.

### **3 Ways You’re Probably Wasting Money (Without Even Knowing It)**
1. **Letting Savings Rot in a ""Safe"" Account**
   - A standard savings account pays *peanuts* in interest. Meanwhile, inflation eats away at your cash.
   - *Example:* $10,000 in a 0.5% APY account earns **$50 a year.** In a high-yield account or smart investment? **$500+.**

2. **Paying for Convenience (When You Don’t Need To)**
   - Subscription creep is real. That $12.99 app? **$156/year.** The premium cable package you barely watch? **$1,200+.**
   - *Pro tip:* Audit your subscriptions monthly. Cancel one, and **reinvest that cash.**

3. **Ignoring the Power of Compound Growth**
   - Even small, consistent investments grow *exponentially* over time.
   - *Example:* $200/month at 7% interest = **$240,000 in 30 years.** (Yes, really.)

### **The Mindset Shift That Changes Everything**
Money isn’t about restriction—it’s about **redirection.** Every dollar you *don’t* waste is a dollar that can:
- **Fund your dream vacation** (without guilt).
- **Build a safety net** so you sleep easier.
- **Grow into real wealth** while you’re busy living life.

I’m really struggling with an issue in my (26M) and my partner’s (30M) 3 year relationship. From the get go, he has been transparent in that he has a friendship with his most recent ex boyfriend. They socialise with each other over text, and meet up in person maybe 3 times a year. 

My partner and his ex might grab a coffee or food together, and visit a museum, as an average catch up. They were together for 18 months around 5 years ago at this point.

I have never felt safe and secure with the situation, and every time it’s discussed, I feel an awful tight feeling in my gut. I should note that I don’t believe anything is going on behind my back - I fully trust my partner and I don’t believe he is capable of that. However, I can’t shake the feeling that it feels disrespectful to me and I feel almost “emotionally cheated on”, as I can’t understand how it could not be a more emotionally involved friendship than any other, given their romantic history.

I’ve attempted over the 3 year relationship to improve my feelings on the situation. I’ve met his former partner in an attempt to settle my nerves, which certainly helped (as he appeared to be a lovely guy), however, I still feel that gut wrenching feeling. 

My partner and I live in a separate area to his ex because of a move a year ago. My partner has told me of his intention to travel to see his ex and other, separate friends, next month. It’s a 3 hour train journey each way. 

Over the last few days, I’ve brought the topic up again with my partner and I explained that I might struggle to accept this friendship continuing long into the future. We intend to buy a house together and start a family, but I can’t see how I could feel positive with him seeing his ex at that stage in our relationship. The idea that I might be at home looking after a baby, whilst he is socialising with an ex, makes me feel awful. I feel that he should prioritise our relationship and put me first, if he wants us to build a life with me. I hoped and expected that his relationship with his ex would naturally fizzle out as our relationship developed, and given the geographical move mentioned above. They also share no friends, and so it’s not as though they see each other as they are in the same social circle.

I suggested for us to attempt to make it so I am involved whenever they see each other in person. If he was to become my friend, then I’d imagine that I would feel at least better about the situation. My partner has rejected this proposal as he feels it’s too much of a restraint, but did say that it would be a good idea for me and his ex to attempt to form a friendship. 

My partner has made it absolutely clear to me that his friendship with his ex will continue, and he is not willing to allow it to fizzle out. He says that if he was to give in on this, it opens us up to a slippery slope of an unhealthy relationship where we tell each other what we can or can’t do. I’ve attempted to reassure him that I wouldn’t be asking anything unreasonable of him. 

Considering the above, I need to decide whether I can accept this or if I need to exit from the relationship before we become more involved with a mortgage and kids. 

  
Can I please have your opinions on whether I or my partner are being unreasonable, and/or any suggestions on how we might improve this situation for the pair of us? Thank you.",0,1767113605.0,relationship_advice,7,0.5,False

So, what I'd like are some ideas about what to buy in 2026. I know so much of this is personal preference, but looking forward to 2026, what should be on my radar to buy, try, and is there anything to avoid? What is your 2026 purchase list looking like?

I have $40/mo to spend on whiskey. What should I buy?

I have $70/mo to spend on whiskey. What bottles do I need to have in my cabinet to enjoy and sip on, and what do I need to have to drink?

I have $120/mo to spend on whiskey. What bottles should I invest in to have in my cabinet to drink, sip, and enjoy as well as any potential unicorns to add to it to impress others.

Finally, while money is still an issue, what bottles should I have on hand. Are there some unicorns that you're looking to get or that I should be on the lookout for? What is overhyped and overpriced?

What I have, what I like*:

Eagle Rare 10 year*

Weller Special Reserve*

RD1 Amburana**

Old Pepper BIB*

James E Pepper barrel proof*

Westward stout cask*

Barrel House Select small batch*

Bulleit Bourbon*

Bulleit 95 Rye

Only problem is, I don't have a good concept of an activity we would both enjoy.

I know that he likes Minecraft and other games that I do not know the names of, along with Dungeons and Dragons. He also does stuff with construction. He is very nerdy and to me just doesn't seem like the typical coffee-shop-go-for-a-walk hangout guy.

From the beginning, there was strong mutual attraction and sex was great. and later he asked me after 2 weeks if I would be open for something serious and I said yes.

we agreed we were both looking for something serious and monogamous. He asked me if i would be open to meet his parents someday. I told him, I am not out to my family and few straight friends, but I do have gay friends where I am fully out and would love him to be part of it. He said, he doesnt want to be part of my straight life but its ok with me to have two lives as long as i respect him. He was heading to.m back home in a month after we met, and he told me “i hope I dont loose you in the process of moving my place and going back home and i hope you will be patient  with me” I told him, I will wait for you as long as you give me a reason to wait for you, i dont want you to come back and say oh I dont feel the same anymore” then I dont want to waste my time. He said no, I am very much interested in you.

The first couple of months were intense but positive: frequent dates, weekly routine for 5 months amazing sexual chemistry, emotional openness, future-oriented conversations, and consistent effort from both sides. He often said things like we have so much “potential,” that I was “perfect for him, not just sexually bit our values matches, and that he wanted a long-term relationship. His parents marriage was a goal for him.

I asked him about his past relationships the first time he asked me out and From what he shared, his past relationships followed a similar pattern. He has dated people he felt strong attraction toward, but those relationships ended once deeper issues surfaced. In one case, he said he “fell out of love” after several months. In another, he ended things because he felt hidden or not fully chosen by his partner. He described having met “good guys” before but still feeling unsure.

Early on, we also had a very open conversation about expectations, communication, and past relationship insecurities. He said he appreciated the clarity and that it made him feel safe. Which he it took 6-7 months to get to this conversation in his past relationship.

Around month 3–4, things started to change. As the relationship became more emotionally real, he began expressing confusion about his feelings and whether he felt enough “spark” or attraction, even though his behavior (seeing each other regularly, initiating plans, sex, affection) largely stayed the same. He oscillated between wanting to keep trying and feeling overwhelmed.

I had to go back home as my mom was in hospital and this time, I asked him to be patient with me and he cried while I was leaving and he said yes I will wait.

When I came back after a week. He questioned the concern of me being closeted and He said he doesnt feel spark and butterflies. He broke up with me

I agreed to coming out to my parents in near future and assured him that I will not leave his side and I am serious about him. I even took a small step coming out to my roommate who is my very good friend to show my seriousness. We got back together

During this period, I became more anxious because of the inconsistency, while still trying to give space and be patient. He acknowledged he was confused, said something might be “wrong with him,” and that he wanted the relationship to work but didn’t know if he could give what I needed.

We broke up once, reconciled briefly, and then broke up again after about 5 months. During the final breakup, he said that although I was an “8/10” and a great partner, he felt life was too short not to look for a “10/10,” and that he wasn’t sure the attraction was enough long-term. He emphasized that I did nothing wrong.

After the breakup, he appeared calm and emotionally detached, returned to dating apps quickly, and blocked me there. When we met once for coffee. he was friendly and relaxed but firm that he didn’t want to continue. I, on the other hand, am struggling with a lot of grief, confusion, and hurt, especially around how someone could feel so certain after months of closeness.

There are much more details in this but this is the shortest I could write and try to fit major information. He was crying during these hard conversations and was seen overwhelmed and confused.

I tried my best to have soft and open communication and tried to show him we can work through and we can take things slow or the way he wants but he has to communicate rather end it.

I’m trying to understand whether this was mainly about attraction, emotional readiness, attachment differences, or something else — and how to make sense of the mismatch between how close the relationship felt and how decisively it ended.

I dont know what happened, it was all good. He even said even though he had longest relationship of 8 months with his ex. With me he had the smoothest non toxic relationship (5 months).

Naay manokan diras uhaw na patok kaayo labaw nag rush hour or ting kaon, tapad rani syas murag night market dira ug atbang ra adtong BLCK coffee shop if I'm not mistaken.

Napansin nako ug 1K or dako na moneybill ang ibayad kay kulang kaayo ilang gina sukli (might be up to 70 pesos kaayo saako estimasyon. ) 
Sakong opinyon imposible sad na namali ra kay daghan customer tungod sako experience. So pls awareness rapud nig mamalit mo dira, knowing us Henerals always raba ta ninyo gadali ug masaligon rapud kaayo. Tas pag uli nato dako na diay kuwang satong kambyo unya too late na para mu-complain raba. 

Sauna ni storya akong kuya nipalit siya didtos manokan (no specific name ang manokan btw pero the location I mentioned kay sakto) unya 1k ang kwarta pero dako daw kaayo ug kuwang sa kambyo maayo na lang daw iya napansin dayon bago mu uli, nabalik raman daw. Thinking rush hour, basin namali ra so wala namo gi bigdeal. 

Second time around 10PM–11PM nipalit mi usab sailaha, 1K japon ang gibayad tapos tung pauli nami gicheck usab ni kuya ang iya sukli kuwang na sad as in murag 70php-80php yata kuwang? Sayang pud kaayo uy! Mou to gistoryahan ni kuya ug nabalik raman hinoun ang sukli. Btw dili sad kaayo daghan tao that time. Pero again, wa namo gi big deal. 

Third experience mou naniy na alarma nako kay impossibleng namali ni. Tipikal na gadali-dali so pritong manok sailaha, gibungkag nako ang nakapilo nako na mga kwarta para mukuha ug smaller bill na 150 (I bought 4 pcs of pritong manok na tag 30 each daw, 4x30= 120 and I payed 150) I noticed tutuk kaayo ang tindero mintras gakuha kog pambayad especially iyang focus sa 1K bills, which I previously ignored kay syempre gabayad man ko di man unta big deal. Nashock ko kay pag bayad nako gisuklian rako niyag 15 pesos instead of 30 pesos, so before ko makatalikod ni ana ko kulang ang sukli kay 120 man tanan. Gi dagdagan ra niyag singko pesos. Ana ko dapat 30 kay 120 man kaha. Mou to gidagdagan niyag 10 pesos para masakto kambyo. 

Aminon nako naka-feel kog kaulaw sauban customers nga gakaon ug katapad nako mupalit unta kay na-caught jud ila attention ug murag nakamatikod pud tung mga nisunod mubayad saako kay tungod saiya facial expression. 

Dili mi dato ug sa tinoud lang for me na igo2 rajud ang sahod maka-survive, dili man kaabot ug 100 tung kuwang sa kambyo pero ako na tihik no, pamasahe napud nako na back and forth sa trabahuan so ug walay 70-100 pesos dili ko ka trabaho ug short jud kaayo ilang sukli. I empathize if ga diskarte sila tungod sa kapigadohon, pero naay mas maayong pamaraan para maka-kwarta. Ug gamay man gina-pasweldo sailaha, I again sympathize with them but I'm not refusing to acknowledge na minaro nang ilang style. And gusto nako i-emphasize that even small wrong-doings are crimes. The male cashier lacked remorse or isn't even apologetic whenever these happens (tinuyuan na kuwang kambyo) no explanation, no reaction jud. Poker face ra ug storyahon sa customer. 

So please guys I know daghan ug residente ang Uhaw, be vigilant and have the guts to get your exact kambyo (change) ug mupalit mo or else mugara ni silas ilang strategy.

I understand where she’s coming from but it’s also my Christmas break from school and I still have to work full time. She wanted him out of the apartment and I tried to compromise and have him leaving the apartment to hang out in the community room from 10:30am until I get home from work at 2:30pm. Also we are sleeping at my parents for a night to be out of the apartment. I feel uncomfortable having him in my own home. I am so tense the entirety that she is home or watching tv in the common area. We are not loud, and she has said she doesn’t know why it bothers her when we are just in my room watching a movie. I have my own room and connected bathroom and my boyfriend is afraid to leave it now. I have given her a decrease in utilities when he visits for the 9 days.

Also, to note I have mixed feelings about this because my roommate brings home one night stands and men frequently. Maybe once every two weeks. There is a lot of tension with my boyfriend and roommate because she brought home a one night stand and I woke up with him naked in my bed. Very traumatic. I have a lock on my door now that I lock every night. I can accept this is her home too and she can do what she likes. My boyfriend doesn’t go to the common room, especially when I’m not there. I don’t know what to do I’m trying but I don’t have a lot of options and it’s causing tension in my relationship with both of them. She says I don’t spend time with her when he’s here, but she is the one with a huge social life and I’m introverted.

It seems to be okay right now but there is tension. My poor boyfriend feels homeless and goes to a coffee shop and the community room. I just feel bad. All he wants to do is relax in my bed and read or watch a program with headphones. How do I continue to manage this situation to where my roommate feels considered and I also feel safe in my home too?",1,1767112605.0,roommates,6,1.0,False

Rather than just standing around waiting inside without ordering anything, I decided to buy something for myself.

He arrived about 10 minutes later and commented, “Oh, you started without me.” It wasn’t aggressive, but it made me pause and wonder if I crossed some unspoken etiquette line.

For context, I don’t expect someone to pay for me on early dates, and I actually prefer splitting the bill, especially on proper restaurant dates. I wasn’t trying to be rude — just didn’t want to awkwardly wait.

Going forward, should I just wait even if someone is late? Or is it reasonable to order something if they’re delayed?

Curious to hear how others handle this.",1,1767112453.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False
1pzmnik,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1pzmnik/newbie_here_with_a_question/,Newbie here with a question,"TLDR: Tried pulling a relatively fresh roast and having issues reaching 9 bar.

Hi, really happy to start roasting beans at home. Just some background, I received a Kaleido M2 Dual system a couple weeks ago, already seasoned and have made four batches of some decently roasted beans...or at least I think so 🤔 Definitely always more room for improvement. My espresso equipment is a DF64 and Mara X V2, both of which I've become pretty proficient with. Anyways, really excited to start delving into different seeds and profiles and hoping I can use everyone's expertise here to make the best of it!

So, here's my question...on 12/26, I roasted a couple of 280g batches (~220g out) of the Neopolitan Blend (dark roast) from Good Brothers Coffee. Dumped them right after the first crack. I usually try to wait about a week before pulling a shot but wanted to try one yesterday. Ground the beans at my normally consistent grind setting on the 64, about 10, and barely a couple drops coming out after a minute of pulling! So, I figure maybe I need to go coarser. Took it up to 17 and loaded it up in the Mara. Now the Mara has about a 9 second pre infusion time where it'll peak around the 3 bar mark before going to 9 bar. So, I pull the shot and it's doing its pre infusion thing and around the 3 bar, it starts slowly pouring out however it never goes up to 9 bar. I know it's not an issue with the machine because I followed with some older beans in the freezer and it went to 9 no problem...a decent shot. 

Is this because the beans are still degassing or does it have to do with the 20% robusta in the blend? Or something else maybe to do with the roast? 

Open to any comments, suggestions and/or questions! Thanks",1,1767112429.0,roasting,0,1.0,False
