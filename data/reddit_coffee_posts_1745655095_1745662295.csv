three year coffee master and everyday i go to work is miserable. customers are nasty because of wait times due to the skeleton crew staffing, and mandatory cup writing. Management is generally VERY micromanaging at the worst times, and entirely unhelpful (being slammed when we have call outs and refusing to help). I’m experiencing workplace bullying by my coworkers who constantly gossip, exclude & demean me in a way i’ve never, ever, experienced at this job before my store transfer to another state. (Please don’t recommend E/C, i’ve went through stuff with them before that i felt was cut and dry and they did absolutely nothing, ex: being called slurs by my coworker) I feel like everything I loved about this job has been forcibly beaten out of me the past 1.5 years.

I have to go to open in a few hours and i’m loosing sleep because im so stressed. Any words of motivation? ",1,1745662218.0,starbucksbaristas,0,1.0,False

He is 35 and I'm 39. We've been together for 2.5 years and living together for 1 year. He works as a welder and I am an assistant kitchen manager at a busy downtown restaurant. I'm coming up on my year since being promoted and it has been really hard but is starting to fall into place. For this year I have been battling major depression and anxiety surrounding my job. With working long hours (min 10 hrs up to 13 hrs/day, 50-55 hrs/wk) and the stress of transitioning my brain and habits into manager mode, I have been slipping on the house work. He works 40 and has complete freedom to not go to work if he chooses where I am constantly on call being on salary. 

Before my promotion, I had a routine and kept the house clean and the laundry kept up. We had a system. I took care of the inside and he took care of the outside. Although, I was always really confused about dishes bc he says it's his habit to come home from work and do a load. So I quit doing them and he let it build up and get gross and then I'd get irritated and clean it all. I tried to explain that if you just keep up a little everyday, it won't build up but the kitchen always still is a huge mess most of the time. 

Anyhoo.. 

Tonight he came at me with an idea for our house work. He wants me to design a chart where each chore is listed. Figure out a dollar amount for each chore. Decide how many times a week that chore gets done. We start with each putting $50 in the jar to make $100. When we do that chore, mark it off and claim that amount from the jar. At the end of the month when the jar is empty, whoever made the least money has to put the next $100 in the jar and it starts over. 

My very first thought was damn, that's dumb, we would basically come out even bc he doesn't finish things he starts and I've been so lazy and tired. Then, my competitive side kicked in bc I do want to be motivated to clean regularly again. I've gotten a better handle on things now and came out of the depression but still stuck in lazy mode. Then he stated that it's a perfect no shame both ways deal bc he knows I have been feeling bad about not keeping up. But I totally felt shamed. He also mentioned that he wanted to like post it so if his buddy wanted to do a chore and grab a few bucks. He is like creating this into a job with income... The income is our own already and I just feel like overall it is gonna be even lol. I don't really understand it. I'm confused .. I feel shamed about it but also kinda motivated by it.

The thing is tho is that the biggest messes are all his... Like the kitchen thing... So like.. I'm always cleaning up after him .. he leaves the coffee table covered in his stuff all the time .. he will wash the clothes but not put them away .. he's only cleaned the bathroom once maybe twice .. 

But.. I have four cats and there's been multiple times he's cleaned their litter boxes. I never intended for him to do that and I thank him for it. 

I also brought up the fact that he has much more time to just rack up a bunch of chores on it and just obliterate me in this ""game"" my hours are funky.. I work 3 days - 10a to 8p shifts and when I get home I have the energy to do stuff but he is in wind down mode bc he works a consistent 6a - 2p. My other two days are 6a-4p shifts and those days wreck me bc I never get enough or good sleep so I'm fkn tired when I get home. He doesn't like it when I do chores n moving around the house so much after like 8p. My days off I want to do me stuff and enjoy my time so I am not motivated to do house work. I do some here and there but not the whole house at once like I used to. He said that that doesn't matter. I think that is unfair. 

Anyways, that was long and basically what I'm trying to decipher is .. am I overreacting or is this some narcissistic level shit?

I also contemplate that, is this a motivation for himself as well or something else? Because like I said, he has a steady routine and I don't. A lot of this stuff he already does by the time I get home from work.. and when I get home, I can't really do much bc it's late already.



TLDR : been depressed and tired from work and fell behind on the housework. Bf designed game that makes me feel shame for falling behind. Bitching about his lack of attentiveness to the chores too. Am I overreacting

I was crossing US19 (SW to SE) at Bonita. I was crossing at the crosswalk. The crossing light was white, not blinking red. I was crossing pulling my oxygen tank behind me.

I took 3 steps to cross when some asshat in a NEWER POS GREEN SUV comes whipping around the corner from Bonita and luckily they slammed on their brakes or I'd be dead. Stopped abt 3ft away.

As much as I'd like to say this was a one off incident I can't. I've nearly been hit DOZENS of times by piece of shit drivers.

NEWSFLASH FUCKERS... When someone is crossing AT THE CROSSWALK WITH THE WALK LIGHT ON we have the right of way. Sadly there are too many assholes that don't give a fuck.

To the driver of the POS GREEN SUV... Yeah I chucked my coffee at you. Be glad I did it left handed or it would have been your hood & windshield instead of your grill.

I hope in your impatience of not giving a handicapped guy 5 fucking seconds to cross you didn't have time to wash my coffee off your POS vehicle and it baked in and fucks up your paint job, you deserve it.

To all the POS drivers out there just be glad Stand Your Ground is so frowned upon for pedestrians against drivers/vehicles because we're really getting tired if you shitheads putting our lives in danger because you think you're special. YOUR PARENTS LIED TO YOU BECAUSE YOUR NOT SPECIAL.

In closing we have the right to you fuckers not putting us in danger so quit playing with all the toys in your hoopties and OPEN YOUR FUCKING EYES!!!!!",1,1745662007.0,Pasco,0,1.0,False

Has anyone else heard of the *Isekai Hitchhike Guide*? I swear I'm not making this up. My cousin’s friend said he actually tried it and... well, he’s *different* now. Not in a bad way. Just... different.

Anyway, here’s how the story goes:

They say if you stand at a deserted road, somewhere your GPS starts glitching and the air smells like burnt sugar, and you hold out your thumb *without thinking of any place at all*, a car will stop for you. Always the same one: matte black, humming low like a dying star, no headlights—only a soft, wrong-colored glow—and a single license plate hanging crooked:

**""42.""**

The driver never speaks first. Just unlocks the door with a click that somehow feels like a memory you almost had.

On the passenger seat? A beat-up booklet: **""ISEKAI HITCHHIKE GUIDE — Pre-Alpha Version.""**

Inside it’s all chaotic scribbles—maps to nowhere, creatures nobody’s ever drawn right, rules scratched in messy handwriting:

* Don’t ask where you’re going.  
* Don’t open your backpack.  
* Don’t assume ""isekai"" means ""better.""  

Yeah, you’ll have a backpack. Even if you didn't bring one.

It’ll be full of all your unfinished business: old fears, songs you never wrote, people you stopped loving before you were ready.

If you break the rules, you loop. Or worse—you glitch back home but everything feels... thin. Coffee tastes metallic. Rain falls the wrong way up.

But if you follow the ride, keep breathing, keep believing *even when it stops making sense*—

one day, the car exits onto a road made of lost stories and pixel dust. And the world ahead isn’t paradise, or hell, or even properly ""isekai."" It’s just... somewhere new. Somewhere nobody’s written yet.

And waiting for you there? A vending machine buzzing under a weird little sun.

Inside: No cheat codes. No upgrades. Just a battered sticker slapped on the glass.

**""DON'T PANIC.""**

And underneath, scribbled in Sharpie, like a dare:

**""Welcome, idiot. Make it weird.""**

The return to Gamma Outpost felt surreal. Stumbling out of the emergency access tunnel near the geothermal plant, blinking in the steady, artificial light, Leo felt like he’d surfaced from a different reality. They were caked in mud and rock dust, suits torn, Lena leaning heavily on Jax, but they were alive. Pixel, Boulder, and Scamp trotted alongside them, occasionally shaking dust from their fur, looking for all the world like concerned pets accompanying their weary owners home from a long shift. The ordinary bustle of the nearby engineering section – the hum of machinery, the distant clang of tools – seemed jarringly normal after the life-or-death struggle in the dark.

Their ragged appearance drew immediate attention. Shift Supervisor Ortega’s eyes widened as they limped into the main corridor. ""Leo? Anya? What in the blazes happened? We lost your signals hours ago!""

""Cave-in,"" Leo managed, his voice hoarse. ""Section Gamma-9. Lena’s injured. We need the medbay, and Chief Borin.""

Ortega gaped at Lena’s makeshift splint and Jax’s bloodied arm, then barked orders into his comm. ""Med team to Corridor B! Get Chief Borin down here now! Priority alert!""

The journey to the medbay was a blur of concerned faces and hushed questions. Dr. Aris met them at the door, her calm efficiency a welcome balm. As she examined Lena’s leg, stabilizing it properly, she frowned at the readings from her scanner. ""Compound fracture, but… the tissue damage around the break is less severe than I’d expect from that kind of pressure. And Jax,"" she turned to him, dabbing antiseptic onto the scrapes on his arm, ""this bruising pattern is… odd. Almost looks like extreme internal pressure, rapidly dissipated.""

Jax grunted noncommittally, avoiding her gaze. Boulder sat by his feet, emitting a low, steady rumble.

Chief Borin arrived, his expression grim. He was a stout man whose receding hairline did little to diminish his air of quiet authority. He listened intently as Leo gave the initial report: the seismic event, the collapse, Lena’s injury, the blocked passage, the rising water. He omitted the crucial detail, his throat dry, unsure how to even begin. Anya remained silent, studying the floor tiles, Pixel uncharacteristically still on her shoulder. Jax just looked exhausted.

""You dug through solid rockfall? With what tools?"" Borin pressed, frowning. ""Standard emergency packs don’t have anything rated for that kind of blockage.""

Leo hesitated. He glanced at Anya, then at Jax. Their eyes met, a shared understanding passing between them. The silence stretched.

It was Anya who broke it, her voice quiet but clear. ""Chief… we didn't use tools. Not exactly.""

Borin raised an eyebrow. ""Explain.""

""It was the Glyphs,"" Anya said, taking a deep breath. ""Pixel… formed some kind of armor on me when rocks started falling. Jax’s arm… Boulder did something to it, turned it into a support strut to hold the ceiling. And Leo…"" She looked at him. ""Scamp changed his arms. He dug us out with… claws.""

The medbay fell silent. Dr. Aris froze, scanner hovering over Lena’s leg. Chief Borin stared at Anya, then slowly turned his gaze to Leo, then Jax. His eyes lingered on Scamp, who chose that moment to playfully bat at a loose strap on Leo’s boot.

""Claws,"" Borin repeated flatly.

""Like… chitinous blades,"" Leo confirmed, his voice barely a whisper. ""Hardened digging implements, Scamp called them."" He held up his hands, showing the raw skin beneath the torn suit fabric. ""They retracted afterwards.""

Jax nodded grimly. ""My arm… it was like solid metal. Hurt like hell changing, but it held the roof up."" He flexed the arm, wincing. ""Boulder did it.""

Borin was silent for a long moment, his gaze sweeping over the three Glyphs, who now seemed oblivious, Pixel grooming Anya’s collar, Boulder nudging Jax’s leg, Scamp looking up expectantly at Leo. Query: Post-mission debriefing protocols require head-pats? Scamp’s thought nudged Leo’s mind. Leo ignored it, his stomach churning.

""Dr. Aris,"" Borin said finally, his voice dangerously quiet. ""Did you find anything unusual in your scans?""

Dr. Aris swallowed. ""The tissue regeneration around Lena's fracture... it's accelerated. Significantly. And Jax's muscle fiber readings show micro-trauma consistent with extreme, rapid expansion and contraction, beyond normal human limits. I saw trace protein markers on Leo’s hand swabs I couldn't identify… I assumed it was cave contamination.""

Borin closed his eyes briefly, processing. When he opened them, his expression was hard but resolute. ""Suit recorders?""

""Mine got smashed early on,"" Leo said.

""Mine too,"" Jax added.

Anya shook her head. ""Partial data, maybe. Heavy interference during the quake.""

Borin nodded slowly. ""Alright. Get cleaned up. Get some rest. All of you. Dr. Aris, keep Lena comfortable. No one,"" he fixed his gaze on Leo, Anya, and Jax, ""says anything about… claws or armor or support struts until I’ve spoken to the rest of the outpost. Is that clear?""

They nodded mutely.

But secrets don’t last long in the close confines of a frontier outpost. By the time Leo had showered and changed, the corridors were buzzing. The news of the cave-in and rescue was out, but distorted fragments of the impossible truth were spreading like wildfire. Whispers followed Leo as he walked towards the mess hall, needing food and synth-coffee, Scamp trotting beside him. People stared, not just at him, but at Scamp. Their expressions ranged from disbelief to wide-eyed fear, to something akin to awe.

He saw Brenda from Hydroponics clutching Fluffy tightly, looking pale. Dave from Comms kept glancing nervously at his own Glyph, Twitch, who was chasing dust motes near the comms console. The ""puppy"" illusion hadn't just shattered; it had exploded.

In the mess hall, conversations died down as they entered. Leo grabbed a tray, acutely aware of every eye on him. He sat alone, Scamp curling up by his feet. He could hear snippets of hushed talk: ""...turned his arm into a what?"" ""...saved their lives, though…"" ""...mine just fetches things, right?"" ""...always thought Sparky was weirdly strong...""

Suddenly, people weren't just remembering cute antics. They were re-evaluating every strange coincidence, every moment of surprising resilience or odd behavior their pets had exhibited. Had Spike really just happened to nudge that falling crate away from Miller’s foot? Did Patches genuinely understand complex maintenance instructions, or was it something else? The air crackled with dawning realization, confusion, and a healthy dose of fear. What were these creatures they had invited into their homes, their lives?

Later that cycle, Chief Borin called an all-hands meeting in the main rec room. The atmosphere was thick with tension. Borin stood at the front, flanked by Leo, Anya, and Jax. He held up a hand for silence.

""Alright, listen up,"" Borin began, his voice calm but firm. ""You've heard rumors. Most of them are probably wild exaggerations."" He paused, letting his gaze sweep across the anxious faces. ""But the core of it… is true. The survey team survived yesterday because their Glyphs intervened. In ways we didn't think were possible.""

He recounted the events calmly, clinically, based on the debriefing. The bio-armor, the structural support limb, the digging claws. He didn't sensationalize it, but he didn't downplay the impossibility either. A wave of murmurs swept the room.

""These creatures,"" Borin continued, gesturing towards Scamp, Pixel, and Boulder who sat near their hosts, looking utterly benign, ""are clearly more than pets. They appear to be symbiotic lifeforms capable of… bio-kinetic adaptation. Triggered by perceived danger to their host.""

He held up a hand against the rising clamor. ""I know this is shocking. It raises questions. Serious ones. About safety, about control, about what they fundamentally are. Some of you are scared. That's understandable.""

""Are they dangerous, Chief?"" someone called out. ""Could they hurt us?""

""Based on everything we've seen,"" Borin said carefully, ""their primary function seems to be host preservation. They acted defensively, protectively. They saved four lives yesterday. However,"" he added sternly, ""we are in uncharted territory. We need to understand this. Panicking, or worse, harming these creatures out of fear, helps no one and could be disastrous.""

He outlined his plan: a restricted inquiry, careful observation, and absolutely no hostile actions towards the Glyphs. ""We need data. We need understanding. I'm asking for volunteers to form a small working group to collate information, analyze available data – like Dr. Aris’s medical findings and Anya’s partial recordings – and develop safe protocols for studying this phenomenon. We need people with relevant expertise and a level head.""

Leo looked at Anya, who nodded slightly. Dr. Aris stepped forward immediately. ""I'll volunteer, Chief. My medical data is the starting point.""

Anya raised her hand. ""My technical skills might be useful for analyzing any recovered data or biological traces.""

All eyes turned to Leo. He felt the weight of their stares, the mixture of fear and curiosity. He looked down at Scamp, who nudged his hand. Leo-host required for important task? Scamp will assist. The simple, unwavering loyalty, even now, solidified his resolve.

""I'll do it,"" Leo said, meeting Borin's gaze. ""Scamp and I… we have some first-hand experience.""

Borin nodded, a flicker of relief in his eyes. ""Good. Leo, Anya, Dr. Aris. You're our working group. Your priority is to help us understand what we're dealing with, safely and ethically. The rest of you – report any unusual Glyph activity directly to me or the working group. No independent experiments. We approach this together, cautiously.""

The meeting broke up, but the tension lingered. People clustered in small groups, talking urgently, casting wary glances at the Glyphs now scattered amongst them. The comfortable normalcy of Gamma Outpost had fractured. Life with their furry companions had just become infinitely more complex, and potentially, infinitely more dangerous. Leo ran a hand through Scamp's soft fur, feeling the familiar warmth. The reckoning had begun.

Update 1: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/1k50uhh/update_entitledgrandparent_wants_to_charge_me/) (update thread for when i moved out, follow ups)

\---

It's been almost a week since I moved out.

Since EGP and everyone except for my Mom were blocked, they realised their calls are unable to reach me, and I received a text from my EGP asking me to call him, but I blocked that too. I called my mom the day I received that text, didn't ask about whether EGP knows what I've done, or anything, just wanted to gauge the situation and see how she's doing.

She was bitter, angry, but civil. Her responses were screaming ""Well, you think you ruined your life because you had to take care of me, now I will take care of myself and never reach out to you, ever again, for help. I'll handle myself, dont need you help"". To clarify, she didn't say any of that. It's what I think best summarizes her tone. Which is hurtful, because I never intended to make her feel like I didn't want to help her. She has no one but me. Her dad is a tyrant, her husband left her for someone else and took her youngest son with him. She suffered, and I dont want her to anymore, never did.

I wanted us to flourish, that's all. Be healthy. Break some cycles of generational trauma, grow together, make our life good. That's why I took space, because I didn't like the direction our relationship was going in and it had showed 0 signs of change, throughout years of consistent effort and communication. But I still never intended to abandon her, not help her, not provide for her.

I received my paycheck today. Naturally, I sent her money. Which she immediately sent back. It's been destroying me. I never intended for this. I feel so guilty. I just wanted a little distance in our relationship, and a lot of distance from EGP. Why am I being punished for it? All the sacrifices and devotion I contributed towards my relationship with my mom, EGP and the family in entirety, seems to have evaporated by my decision to move out. Its hurtful.

Also, forgot to block EGP's son's wife's number (mom's sister-in-law). So got a few calls from that number, accidentally picked one up, said ""what the-"", hung up, blocked. They're pretty insistent to get their hands on me.

All of this has been killing me internally. I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know if I have done anything wrong in the first place, I don't know how to rationalize everything in my head. Which is why you find me here, writing this post.

I haven't been able to schedule a therapy session either, I did get one tho, the day after I moved.

Onto lighter things, I am managing the place pretty well though. I got wifi set up, i got coffee and other basic cooking stuff set up, i got organizers and racks and storage thingamajingies for my bath, I've unpacked a bunch of my boxes. I'm gonna go out and get a proper bed soon, along with a bedside table and whatnot. I had ordered a work-table, which should be delivered in a day or 2. Things are going good at that front. It feels exciting, but still, hollow. I have a lot of guilt in me. I don't know how to handle it.",6,1745661631.0,entitledparents,0,1.0,False

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of €1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

1k89gjx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k89gjx,So grateful for the past 10 days,"I was a married single mom when my kids were born- juggling their care and also being the breadwinner and in grad school. Even though I graduated and divorced my ex husband a few years ago, life has still been very much focused on survival- selling my old house, buying my current house, establishing my career, and managing my son’s severe ADHD and burgeoning host of other potential behavior disorders. It’s been slow going, but things have been getting better since May of 2023…and this morning I’m sitting here at the end of a 10-day vacation in the Bahamas. We’re headed home at 8:30, and I’ve been sitting here quietly sobbing on the balcony, listening to the ocean, watching one last Caribbean sunrise, and drinking coffee. 

   If you had told me a year ago that my son- the same kid who couldn’t handle a trip to the grocery store  without a meltdown- would handle a ten day international trip like a total boss I would have laughed in your face. 

   He’s been amazing this entire vacation. It’s been “yes please” and “thank you sir/maam” with every person he’s encountered. He’s tried new foods and embraced new experiences with gratitude and open-mindedness. He’s been incredibly kind to his little sister (except for telling her she’s being a Karen,) and repeatedly told me that he’s having an amazing time and thanking me for bringing them. He’s been respectful of the locals. He’s had a few moments of being frustrated of course- got way too competitive with some games and had to take a break, was sad I wouldn’t let him play his switch for more than an hour a day- but he was able to regulate his frustration and accept the limits. 

  I have second guessed myself, my kid, and my parenting since 2022 when his preschool teacher told me there was something “going on” with him. It has been so hard to trust the pediatrician and the therapists sometimes to keep up with behavior chart after behavior chart, validating his feelings when he was violent with me, constant medication adjustments, and everything else….but every second has been worth it. 

   I have genuinely relaxed and enjoyed my children’s company the past ten days. I’m heading home with a camera full of photographs and head stuffed full of amazing memories. And for the first time in three years, I feel like a *good* mom. All because of my sweet kids and how amazing they are. And I’m so grateful.

""Wendy, you really need to get that hearing aid replaced. It's going to mess with your hearing if you wait much longer.""  
  
Director Zane's voice cut through the quiet of his office.  
  
Wendy Harris sat across from him, still in her scrubs after a long shift, posture polite but tired.  
  
She nodded. ""Thanks, Director Zane. I know.""  
  
He sighed, tapping a pen against his clipboard. ""Honestly, based on your latest exam, a cochlear implant would be the smarter choice. They're not even that expensive anymore. With post-op care, you're looking at... what, six hundred grand total?""  
  
Then, softening a bit, he added, ""For your family, that's practically nothing. You don't need to wait.""  
  
Everyone at the hospital knew about the Harris family. When Wendy first joined the staff, the Harrises had donated two top-of-the-line imported diagnostic machines.  
  
Money clearly wasn't an issue. At least, not for them.  
  
Outside the office, Wendy pulled out her phone and checked her bank app.  
  
$56,005.83.  
  
That was every cent she'd managed to save over the past year.  
  
Director Zane was right—six hundred grand was pocket change for the Harrises. But for her?  
  
She'd have to break the bank for that.  
  
Wendy had been adopted into the Harris family when she was young, and she'd been taught the rules early:  
  
Take only what you're given. Be grateful. Never ask for more.  
  
Asking made you greedy. Ungrateful. A stray pretending to be family.  
  
Back in the ward, she changed out of her scrubs and into her regular clothes before heading home. The clock read just past 7 p.m.  
  
Lately, Jadeton had been buried in gray skies and nonstop rain. The kind of weather that seeped into your bones and made everything feel a little heavier.  
  
She didn't live with the Harris family—not anymore. Her apartment was small, rented, and conveniently close to the hospital.  
  
When she opened the front door, she paused. The entry light was on.  
  
Charlie Becker was home.  
  
Her fingers tightened slightly on the doorknob. She glanced down, brushing off any rain or dirt clinging to her clothes.  
  
Charlie was a legend at Jadeton Hospital—the youngest lead neurosurgeon in its history. A genius. A perfectionist. And a notorious clean freak.  
  
He also happened to be her fiancé.  
  
Their engagement had been... unexpected. More of a family arrangement than a love story. And to help them ""bond,"" the Harrises and Beckers had suggested they live together.  
  
In reality, it felt more like she'd moved into a museum where she wasn't allowed to touch anything.  
  
Wendy carefully stepped inside, silently slipping off her shoes.  
  
The living room was dark, but the faint shape of someone curled up on the couch told her Charlie was asleep.  
  
She tiptoed closer. His eyes were shut, lashes dark and thick against pale skin. He looked almost peaceful like this.  
  
Charlie had been overseas for a medical conference, and even after getting back, he'd jumped straight into back-to-back surgeries.  
  
There were faint blue shadows under his eyes, and his brows were drawn in like he hadn't gotten a minute of decent sleep.  
  
The living room window was cracked open, and the rain-wind combo drifting in was icy.  
  
Charlie was only wearing a button-up.  
  
Wendy's gaze flicked toward the folded throw blanket she usually used, resting on her small corner sofa.  
  
She hesitated, then picked it up. But when it came time to actually cover him with it... she froze.  
  
Instead, she sat in her little armchair and clutched the blanket in her lap, eyes drifting back to him.  
  
He was exhausted. She didn't want to wake him.  
  
But then his phone buzzed sharply on the coffee table.  
  
Wendy instinctively reached over to silence it—only to hear a voice, low and cold:  
  
""What are you doing?""  
  
Her breath caught. She looked up, and there he was—awake now, eyes open and fixed right on her.  
  
His voice wasn't loud, but it didn't need to be.  
  
Wendy froze. ""I—I wasn't trying to do anything. I saw you were sleeping, and I just—""  
  
She trailed off, words tumbling and useless.  
  
Charlie's gaze dropped to her hand, still reaching toward his phone. She followed his eyes, then quickly pulled her hand back, rubbing her fingers on her sleeve like she could erase the moment.  
  
""I didn't touch anything,"" she added quietly, almost like a child caught doing something wrong.  
  
Charlie slowly blinked. When he spoke again, his tone was flat.  
  
""How many times do I have to tell you not to touch my stuff?""  
  
Wendy just stood there, a little numb, unsure how to explain.  
  
Not that it mattered. Charlie had laid down the rules from day one.  
  
Don't go through his things. Don't touch his files, don't sit on his couch, don't use his mug.  
  
The entire apartment had invisible fences. What had her name on it was hers. Everything else?  
  
Off-limits.  
  
Even now, in this living room, the only place she was ""allowed"" to sit was that little chair.  
  
She watched as Charlie glanced at his phone and sighed, annoyed. He picked it up and muttered into the receiver:  
  
""Get me a new phone. Deliver it tonight.""  
  
A pause.  
  
""And replace the living room sofa. Deep clean, full disinfection.""  
  
He didn't raise his voice. Didn't even look at her.  
  
Wendy followed his line of sight and saw it—the corner of the blanket in her lap had accidentally draped over the couch.  
  
Her stomach twisted. She didn't say a word.  
  
She didn't even lift her head.  
  
Instead, she stared at her hands, slowly moving them behind her back. Her left thumb rubbed gently over the web of her right.  
  
She wanted to tell him—  
  
She wasn't dirty at all.  
  
Chapter 2: Charlie  
  
Charlie radiated cold.  
  
Wendy stood frozen in the living room, barely breathing, like even the sound of her own breath might be too loud.  
  
She bit her lip, shoulders tense, feet rooted to the floor.  
  
She felt like a child caught doing something wrong—waiting to be scolded, punished, dismissed. Every muscle in her body was locked.  
  
Charlie ended his call, hung up the phone, and stood.  
  
Without a word. Without a glance.  
  
He walked right past her and out the front door. The breeze that followed stirred the hem of her shirt, cool and impersonal.  
  
The door clicked shut behind him.  
  
Only the soft glow of the entry light remained, casting long shadows across the quiet room.  
  
Wendy stood there alone, unmoving.  
  
She didn't have to guess—he was heading to the hospital.  
  
It wasn't the first time this had happened. Living under the same roof, no matter how careful she was, there was always some invisible line she crossed without meaning to.  
  
Once, while she was cleaning, she accidentally knocked over the mug Charlie used the most.  
  
By the next day, everything in the apartment had been replaced—cups, utensils, even towels.  
  
Even her personal things had been soaked in disinfectant.  
  
And Charlie?  
  
He didn't come home for a whole month.  
  
Back then, she hadn't understood. Not really.  
  
Until one day at work, she overheard a group of doctors joking about how dedicated Dr. Becker was—working late every night, sleeping in the hospital, barely even going home.  
  
Charlie had only shrugged and said,  
  
""Someone touched my things. They're contaminated.""  
  
That was when it clicked.  
  
Charlie didn't just dislike her.  
  
He couldn't stand her.  
  
Since then, Wendy had trained herself to be careful with everything. To tread lightly. To disappear into corners.  
  
The rain outside fell in a soft, steady drizzle.  
  
She hadn't eaten. She'd spent the day assisting with surgery, and now she was too tired to care.  
  
After washing up, she went straight to bed.  
  
When she woke the next morning, the apartment was still and silent—exactly the way it had been when she fell asleep.  
  
Charlie hadn't come back.  
  
She got ready quietly, her motions efficient, routine.  
  
In the bathroom mirror, she caught sight of her own reflection—clean, pale, eyes still a little tired.  
  
Her thoughts drifted to what Director Zane had said the day before.  
  
Her hearing loss hadn't been congenital.  
  
The Harris family had treated her well. At least on the surface. Mr. Harris had even gifted her the hearing aid she used now.  
  
It had been a celebratory gift when she got accepted into Jadeton Medical.  
  
She was grateful. Truly.  
  
But gratitude was all she allowed herself.  
  
Anything more would be… selfish. Ungrateful.  
  
Presumptuous.  
  
After her morning shift, Wendy was doing rounds in the wards. When she got back to the nurse's station, the doctors were already gathering for the Monday rounds, which always started a bit later than usual.  
  
She spotted Charlie right away.  
  
White coat. Neutral expression. Eyes lowered as someone beside him spoke.  
  
Even among the crowd of doctors, he stood out.  
  
Youngest attending in the department. Most brilliant surgeon they had.  
  
He carried the kind of presence that turned heads and quieted rooms.  
  
Wendy's heart tensed. Last night still clung to her like a second skin.  
  
She stayed quiet, trying to ease around the cluster of doctors blocking her path back to the station.  
  
But then the head nurse called out, ""Wendy, you done with vitals?""  
  
""Yes,"" Wendy replied. ""No major changes. But Bed 29 has a fever. The family wants a doctor to take a look.""  
  
""How about the old man in Bed 4?""  
  
Wendy glanced down at the notes in her hand. ""He's stable. He's stopped resisting treatment but keeps asking when he can be discharged.""  
  
""Bed 4?"" A low voice cut in.  
  
She looked up.  
  
Charlie.  
  
His dark eyes were unreadable, fixed on her.  
  
""The elderly man who had the stroke,"" she clarified.  
  
""I know."" His voice was flat, clipped. ""Why'd you say he was resisting treatment?""  
  
Wendy opened her mouth, but before she could answer, another doctor chimed in with a chuckle.  
  
""You weren't here when he was admitted, Dr. Becker. The guy was impossible. We all tried talking to him, but in the end, Nurse Harris is the only one who got through.""  
  
""Nurse Harris is everyone's favorite,"" another joked. ""She's got that kind, gentle vibe. Patients love her.""  
  
Wendy kept her head down, hands steady. ""I'm just doing my job.""  
  
Her voice was soft. She didn't smile.  
  
Her uniform was spotless. Perfectly pressed. Her shoes were clean, her hair neatly pinned back.  
  
She could feel Charlie's eyes on her.  
  
And still, she stood straight, calm, collected—on the outside.  
  
Because no matter how small the moment, how fleeting his attention, Wendy wanted to try.  
  
To do just a little better.  
  
To show him—she wasn't useless.  
  
But then came his voice again. Cold. Sharp.  
  
""Saving patients is our job. There's nothing admirable about doing what you're paid to do.""  
  
The compliment disappeared like a puff of smoke.  
  
Wendy's fingers curled tightly at her sides. ""I understand,"" she murmured.  
  
By the time she dared to glance up, Charlie was already walking away.  
  
She caught only the side of his face—his usual expression: indifferent. Distant. Untouched.  
  
Everyone in the hospital knew about them.  
  
That they were engaged.  
  
That she was a Harris.  
  
That the Harrises had donated generously to Jadeton Medical after she joined.  
  
Some of the nurses whispered behind her back.  
  
One leaned over and whispered now, ""Jeez. That was cold. Did you hear what he just said?""  
  
Wendy, still writing in her chart, said softly, ""He's right. It's part of our job.""  
  
""You're too loyal to him, girl.""  
  
Everyone knew Wendy was devoted to Charlie.  
  
Blindly, some said. Stupidly, others added.  
  
There was even a running joke:  
  
Other people believed in fate or money or ambition.  
  
Wendy?  
  
She believed in Charlie Becker.  
  
But no one ever said that to Charlie's face.  
  
Because everyone also knew—  
  
Charlie Becker didn't believe in her.  
  
To him, Wendy might as well not even exist.  
  
Chapter 3: Fiona  
  
At noon, Wendy had just finished her rounds when her phone rang. It was Mr. Harris.  
  
She picked up quickly, her tone polite. ""Hi, Dad.""  
  
Logan Harris's voice came through, calm but firm. ""Come to Harris Hills tonight. There's something we need to talk about.""  
  
""Okay,"" Wendy replied softly. She was always obedient when it came to the Harris family.  
  
""And bring Charlie with you.""  
  
Before she could say anything else, the call ended with a click.  
  
The dial tone rang in her ears—sharp and abrupt, like a silent push.  
  
Wendy stood still for a second, hesitating as she looked toward the doctor's office.  
  
After a beat, she made her way over. Just as she raised her hand to knock, the door opened, and Fred Smith stepped out.  
  
It was the same doctor who'd complimented her earlier. He was holding a file and looked like he was in a rush. ""Looking for Dr. Becker?""  
  
Wendy nodded. ""I have something to talk to him about.""  
  
Fred handed her the patient file. ""Everyone's off to lunch. He's probably inside resting. You can give him this—it's for Bed 4. I've got a meeting with the director.""  
  
He spoke quickly and kindly, even holding the door open for her before hurrying away.  
  
Left with no other option, Wendy walked in.  
  
The moment she stepped inside, she was met with the sound of soft sobs and a woman's panicked voice.  
  
Startled, Wendy froze.  
  
Then she heard Charlie's voice—low, calm, and unmistakably cold. ""Who let you in?""  
  
She looked up and saw a female patient sitting at his desk, tears streaking down her cheeks.  
  
Wendy's heart tightened. Neurology patients often struggled emotionally. She knew breakdowns like this weren't uncommon.  
  
Still, nobody liked being seen in their most vulnerable state.  
  
Quickly lowering her head, she murmured, ""Sorry... I didn't mean to interrupt.""  
  
Charlie didn't look at her. Instead, his tone softened as he turned to the patient. ""You can go back to your ward. Or take a walk outside and clear your mind. If you need anything, I'm here.""  
  
The patient nodded, reassured, and quietly left.  
  
Wendy stayed rooted to the spot.  
  
She had always known—Charlie could be warm. Kind, even. Just never with her.  
  
""I came to deliver a file,"" she said quietly, holding it out. ""Dr. Smith asked me to give it to you.""  
  
She didn't mention that she hadn't opened the door herself.  
  
""The door was closed. You didn't think to knock?"" Charlie's gaze was sharp. ""Did no one ever teach you about patient confidentiality?""  
  
""I didn't mean to... I didn't see—"" Her voice faltered, then trailed off.  
  
Charlie was holding a pen in his hand, his expression unreadable, the shadows under his eyes giving him a colder edge than usual.  
  
He didn't raise his voice, but Wendy could feel the anger radiating off him.  
  
She bit her lip, set the file on his desk, and spoke in a low voice. ""It won't happen again.""  
  
The pen hit the desk with a dull thud as he dropped it. ""Think before you act.""  
  
Wendy stood there awkwardly, cheeks burning. Embarrassed, but unsure what else she could say.  
  
She wasn't good at talking to people—never had been.  
  
When she was little, her hearing loss had made speech difficult. Even now, her words came slower than most.  
  
People used to laugh at her for stuttering. Over time, she just stopped speaking unless she had to.  
  
Charlie didn't know any of that.  
  
And even if he did—he probably wouldn't care.  
  
""Leave,"" he said flatly.  
  
Wendy swallowed, then gently placed the file on the desk. Her voice was quieter now. ""Dad called. He said to come to Harris Hills tonight.""  
  
Charlie didn't say a word.  
  
Wendy thought maybe he hadn't heard. She tried again, softer, ""He wants both of us there for dinner—""  
  
""You're so clingy.""  
  
Charlie's voice was colder than before.  
  
Wendy froze. The words stung more than she wanted to admit.  
  
She forced a smile, though it barely reached her eyes. ""Then... I'll wait for you after your shift.""  
  
Without waiting for a reply, she turned and left the office.  
  
She didn't slam the door. She made sure it closed gently—quiet, careful, just like she always was around him.  
  
The rest of the afternoon was hectic. By the time Wendy clocked out, it was nearly six.  
  
She quickly changed and went to look for Charlie, only to find the door to his office cracked open.  
  
He was still in a meeting.  
  
So she waited.  
  
A few nurses passing by shot her teasing looks. One of them giggled, ""Still waiting on Dr. Becker? You're too dedicated, Wendy. Let us know when the wedding is—we'll all be there to cheer you on.""  
  
Wendy lowered her head, face warm with embarrassment. She didn't respond.  
  
She waited for almost half an hour before the door opened.  
  
Doctors walked out one by one—but Charlie wasn't among them.  
  
Confused, Wendy stayed put until Fred spotted her again.  
  
""You're still here?"" he asked, eyebrows raised. ""Aren't you off today?""  
  
""Yeah. I'm just looking for Dr. Becker. I thought he was in the meeting.""  
  
Fred blinked, then said, ""Oh—he left early. Had a meeting around two and went straight out after that. Didn't he tell you?""  
  
Wendy blinked, trying to hide the flicker of disappointment. ""I guess... I didn't ask, so he didn't mention it.""  
  
Fred looked at her with something close to sympathy. ""He's probably just swamped. Happens to all of us.""  
  
Wendy gave him a small smile and thanked him before leaving.  
  
She didn't call or text Charlie.  
  
She didn't need to.  
  
When it came to the Harris family, Charlie never forgot anything.  
  
Sure enough, when she arrived at Harris Hills, he was already there.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a motorbike cup holder hinges on several key features. These include the mounting mechanism, the holder's adjustability, the materials used in its construction, and its ability to securely hold different types of beverages. A well-designed cup holder will not only keep your drink in place but also withstand the vibrations and forces experienced during a ride.

**Mounting Mechanism:** The mounting mechanism is crucial for a secure and stable attachment to your motorbike.

Many cup holders utilize handlebar clamps, offering a universal fit for most motorcycles. These clamps typically feature adjustable screws or quick-release mechanisms for easy installation and removal. Other options include mirror stem mounts, which are ideal for scooters and motorcycles with limited handlebar space, and frame mounts, which provide a more permanent and robust solution. The choice of mounting mechanism depends on your motorcycle's design and your personal preferences. The best mounting mechanisms offer a vibration-dampening feature to minimize spills.

**Adjustability:** The adjustability of a cup holder allows you to customize its position and angle for optimal visibility and accessibility.

A highly adjustable cup holder can be rotated 360 degrees, allowing you to position your drink in the most convenient location. This is particularly important for riders with different handlebar configurations or those who prefer to keep their drink within easy reach. Some cup holders also feature adjustable clamps or arms that can accommodate different cup sizes, ensuring a snug and secure fit for various beverage containers.

**Material Construction:** The materials used in the construction of a cup holder determine its durability, weather resistance, and overall lifespan.

High-quality cup holders are typically made from durable materials such as aluminum alloy, stainless steel, or high-impact plastic. Aluminum alloy offers excellent strength and corrosion resistance, while stainless steel provides exceptional durability and a sleek aesthetic. High-impact plastic is a more affordable option that still offers good durability and weather resistance. The ideal material should be able to withstand the elements and the rigors of daily use.

**Cup Retention System:** A secure cup retention system is essential to prevent spills and keep your drink in place, especially on bumpy roads or during sudden maneuvers.

Cup retention systems vary from simple rubber grips to more elaborate designs with adjustable arms or netting. Rubber grips provide a basic level of retention, while adjustable arms can be tightened or loosened to accommodate different cup sizes. Netting provides a more secure hold, preventing the cup from bouncing out even on rough terrain. The best cup retention systems offer a combination of these features to ensure maximum security and stability.

Key features of the best motorbike cup holders include:
  * Secure and adjustable mounting mechanism
  * Durable and weather-resistant construction
  * Adjustable cup holder to accommodate various sizes
  * Reliable cup retention system

 ## Core Benefits

Investing in a quality motorbike cup holder offers several core benefits, enhancing your riding experience and improving your overall comfort and convenience. These benefits range from staying hydrated on long rides to simply enjoying a beverage without the hassle of stopping.

**Enhanced Hydration:** A cup holder allows you to easily access and consume beverages while riding, promoting hydration and preventing fatigue.

Staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining focus and alertness on long rides. A cup holder eliminates the need to stop frequently to take a drink, allowing you to stay refreshed and energized throughout your journey. This is especially important in hot weather or during strenuous riding conditions, where dehydration can quickly lead to fatigue and reduced performance.

**Increased Convenience:** Having a readily accessible cup holder simplifies your riding experience, allowing you to enjoy a beverage without compromising safety or convenience.

A cup holder adds a layer of convenience to your ride, allowing you to enjoy a coffee, soda, or water without having to fumble with bottles or cans. This is particularly useful during commutes or errands, where you may want to grab a quick drink without interrupting your journey. The ease of access provided by a cup holder makes your ride more enjoyable and less stressful.

**Improved Safety:** By providing a secure and stable place for your drink, a cup holder minimizes distractions and reduces the risk of spills, enhancing your safety on the road.

A secure cup holder prevents your drink from sloshing around or spilling, which can be a major distraction while riding. This allows you to focus on the road ahead and maintain better control of your motorcycle. By minimizing distractions and reducing the risk of spills, a cup holder contributes to a safer and more enjoyable riding experience.

**Reduced Clutter:** A dedicated cup holder eliminates the need to carry drinks in your backpack or jacket, reducing clutter and improving your comfort.

Carrying drinks in your backpack or jacket can be uncomfortable and inconvenient, especially on long rides. A cup holder provides a dedicated space for your beverage, freeing up your hands and reducing the weight you have to carry. This not only improves your comfort but also reduces the risk of spills or leaks inside your bag.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions about motorbike cup holders can help potential buyers make informed decisions and ensure they choose the right product for their needs. These questions often relate to compatibility, installation, and maintenance.

**Will this cup holder fit my motorcycle?**
    Most handlebar-mounted cup holders are designed with universal clamps that fit a wide range of handlebar sizes. However, it's always best to check the product specifications to ensure compatibility with your specific motorcycle model. Mirror stem mounts are typically suitable for scooters and motorcycles with limited handlebar space, while frame mounts require a more permanent installation and may not be compatible with all motorcycles.

**How easy is it to install the cup holder?**
    The installation process varies depending on the type of cup holder. Handlebar-mounted cup holders are generally the easiest to install, requiring only a screwdriver or Allen wrench to tighten the clamps. Mirror stem mounts are also relatively simple to install, while frame mounts may require more specialized tools and expertise. Most cup holders come with detailed installation instructions to guide you through the process.

**What type of drinks can I safely carry in this cup holder?**
    Most cup holders are designed to accommodate standard-sized cups, cans, and bottles. However, it's important to consider the size and weight of your drink when choosing a cup holder. Some cup holders may not be suitable for larger or heavier containers. Additionally, it's recommended to avoid carrying open containers of hot liquids, as spills can be dangerous while riding.

**How do I clean and maintain my motorbike cup holder?**
    Cleaning and maintaining your cup holder is essential to ensure its longevity and performance. Regularly wipe down the cup holder with a damp cloth to remove dirt and debris. For more stubborn stains, you can use a mild soap and water solution. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the cup holder's finish. Periodically check the mounting hardware and tighten any loose screws or bolts.

I recently gave Lovable.dev a try — it’s this AI platform that promises to help you build a working app just by describing it in normal human words.

As a professional skeptic (and part-time overthinker), I figured, why not test how bad it can be?

Turns out, it’s actually pretty impressive.

I asked it to build a personal task manager — user accounts, reminders, basic UI, nothing crazy.

Instead of spitting out a random template, it asked smart questions like:

**""Should users get deadline notifications?""**

**""Mobile-first or desktop?""**

**""Do you want authentication, or do you trust the internet way more than you should?""**


By the end of the chat, it generated a real app skeleton. Not just lorem ipsum nonsense — a legit starting point I could actually deploy, customize, and expand.

**Quick facts they don't really scream at you from the home page:**

* Free accounts get 5 credits every 24 hours (each credit = 1 feature you generate).

* Paid plan is $25/month and gives you 100 credits daily (a lot if you’re feeling ambitious or just really indecisive).

* No credit card needed just to poke around.


**What I liked:**

* Super conversational, not robotic or painfully rigid.

* Actually thinks a little before building, not just dumping code at you.

* Good base to build on without crying yourself to sleep over setup.


**What’s missing:**

* It’s not full-on AI magic. If you want fancy stuff, you'll still have to get your hands dirty.

* UI design options could use a glow-up. Right now, it’s more IKEA starter kit than Apple showroom.


**Bottom line:**

If you want to throw an idea at an AI and see it turn into something real (without selling your soul or your free time), it's honestly a pretty cool tool.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best cups for drinks in 2025 are defined by several key features, including material quality, insulation technology, design aesthetics, and overall durability. Brands are constantly innovating to improve these aspects, providing consumers with cups that are both functional and visually appealing.

**Material Composition**

The material used to construct a cup significantly impacts its performance, durability, and aesthetic appeal. Common materials include glass, stainless steel, ceramic, and plastic, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. High-quality glass, such as borosilicate glass, offers excellent clarity and heat resistance. Stainless steel, particularly food-grade 18/8 stainless steel, is durable, rust-resistant, and often used in insulated cups. Ceramic provides a classic feel and is suitable for hot beverages, while BPA-free plastics offer affordability and versatility. In 2025, consumers are increasingly seeking sustainable options, such as bamboo fiber cups and recycled materials.

**Insulation Technology**

Insulation is crucial for maintaining the temperature of your drinks, whether hot or cold. Double-walled insulation, particularly vacuum insulation, is highly effective in preventing heat transfer. This technology is commonly found in stainless steel tumblers and travel mugs, keeping beverages hot for hours and preventing condensation with cold drinks. Some advanced models also incorporate copper lining for enhanced thermal conductivity, further improving insulation performance. Consumers are increasingly prioritizing cups that can maintain optimal temperature for extended periods.

**Design and Ergonomics**

The design of a cup affects both its visual appeal and its usability. Ergonomic designs, such as contoured shapes and comfortable handles, make cups easier to hold and drink from. The aesthetic design, including colors, patterns, and finishes, allows consumers to express their personal style. Many brands offer customizable options, allowing customers to personalize their cups with monograms, logos, or unique designs. In 2025, minimalist and modern designs are trending, along with eco-friendly materials and sustainable production practices.

**Durability and Maintenance**

A durable cup is an investment that will withstand daily use and last for years. Stainless steel and high-quality plastics are known for their resistance to impact and wear. Glass cups, while more fragile, can be durable if made from borosilicate glass or tempered glass. Easy maintenance is also a key consideration. Cups that are dishwasher-safe and easy to clean are highly desirable. Stain-resistant and odor-resistant materials are also valued, particularly for cups used to hold coffee, tea, or other beverages that can leave residue.

 ## Core Benefits

The best cups for drinks in 2025 offer several core benefits that enhance the drinking experience and provide added convenience for users. These benefits range from improved temperature control to enhanced durability and ease of use.

**Enhanced Temperature Control**

High-quality insulated cups can keep beverages hot for up to 12 hours and cold for up to 24 hours. This is particularly beneficial for commuters, travelers, and anyone who wants to enjoy their drinks at the perfect temperature for an extended period. For example, a double-walled stainless steel tumbler can keep coffee hot during a morning commute or keep iced tea cold during a summer picnic. This level of temperature control significantly enhances the enjoyment of beverages.

**Improved Durability and Longevity**

Durable cups made from stainless steel or high-quality plastics can withstand daily wear and tear, making them a long-lasting investment. Unlike disposable cups, these durable options reduce waste and save money in the long run. For instance, a stainless steel water bottle can be used for years without rusting or breaking, making it a sustainable and cost-effective choice. This durability is especially important for active individuals who need a reliable cup that can withstand outdoor adventures.

**Increased Convenience and Portability**

Many cups are designed with convenience and portability in mind. Travel mugs with leak-proof lids and comfortable handles are ideal for on-the-go use. Lightweight materials and compact designs make these cups easy to carry in a bag or backpack. For example, a collapsible silicone cup can be easily stored when not in use, making it perfect for travel. This convenience and portability allow users to enjoy their favorite beverages anywhere, anytime.

**Health and Safety Considerations**

High-quality cups are made from BPA-free materials, ensuring that no harmful chemicals leach into your drinks. This is particularly important for cups used to hold hot beverages, as heat can accelerate the leaching process. Stainless steel and glass are generally considered the safest options, as they are non-reactive and do not contain harmful chemicals. Choosing a cup made from safe materials can help protect your health and well-being.

 ## FAQs Section

Consumers often have questions about the best cups for drinks, particularly regarding their compatibility, maintenance, and safety. Here are some common questions and answers to help you make an informed decision.

**Are stainless steel cups safe to use for acidic beverages like lemon water or orange juice?**

Yes, high-quality stainless steel cups, particularly those made from 18/8 or 304 stainless steel, are resistant to corrosion and are safe to use for acidic beverages. However, it's essential to ensure that the stainless steel is food-grade and free from any coatings that could react with acidic substances. Regular cleaning is also recommended to prevent any buildup of residue.

**How do I properly clean insulated cups to prevent odors and bacteria buildup?**

To properly clean insulated cups, disassemble all parts, including the lid and any removable components. Wash each part with warm, soapy water and a soft sponge or brush. For hard-to-reach areas, use a bottle brush. Rinse thoroughly and allow to air dry completely before reassembling. To remove odors or stains, you can use a mixture of baking soda and water or vinegar and water. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or bleach, as these can damage the insulation or the cup's finish.

**What is the difference between single-walled and double-walled cups, and which is better for temperature retention?**

Single-walled cups have a single layer of material, while double-walled cups have two layers with an air gap between them. Double-walled cups offer better temperature retention because the air gap acts as an insulator, preventing heat transfer. Vacuum-insulated double-walled cups provide the best temperature retention, as the air is removed from the gap, further reducing heat transfer. For beverages that need to stay hot or cold for extended periods, double-walled or vacuum-insulated cups are the better choice.

1k891r2,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1k891r2/track_saw_or_track_compatible_circular_saw/,Track saw or track compatible circular saw ?,"Hey everyone, 

I'm still a beginner and looking to buy my first power tool. I don't have the room or money for a table saw yet, and I would probably save and go for a SawStop because I'm not the most handy guy around. 

So, the conundrum I face is this : I have some thick slabs to rip (a little more than 2 inches thick) and I will probably will have more thick stock to cut soon because I'm planning on getting a few dirt cheap reclaimed oak beams to make my workbench with. The beams are 6"" x 4"". Aside from these projects involving chunky lumber, I will focus first on making boxes, small furniture (think end table, valet, coffee table), maybe try my hand at making an electric guitar. 

I was looking at getting a Makita corded track saw, it looks fine for general woodworking, especially since it apparently makes very clean cuts, but the maximum cutting depth of 2"" is not huge. Maybe I can cut thick stock by making a full depth cut on one side, then turning the board around and cutting the same on the other side, but I'm not sure it would be easy to line up the two cuts and that takes away from the quality of cut advantage (only on stock thicker than 2"" though). 

On the other hand, I've found that Makita makes corded and cordless circular saws that are compatible with their tracks, with blade diameter that go up to 10.5"", making 4"" deep cuts possible. That means one pass for the beams and the ability to cut up to 8"" thick lumber in two passes. The cut may not be as clean, but I can always clean it up with a plane. And a circular saw might prove useful if I need to do any framing or carpentry in the future. 

What would you choose? Has anyone tried the Makita circular saws with a track who could compare it to a track saw cut? I don't understand why one circular blade makes great cuts (track saw or table saw) while another makes rougher cuts (circular saw), when the general principle is the same. Can't I just put a good quality blade in my circular saw and get around the same result? 

I'm not planning on working with plywood, maybe I will someday but I'm not a big fan so probably not often. 

Anyway, I'll appreciate everyone's input.

The fear had ravaged the people and their way of life, disturbing the peace and bringing a frenzy to the everyday citizen. First, it began with sinister graffiti, smothering the walls of important landmarks of the isles, namely the school, the statue of the founder, and even the building harbouring the mayor’s office. They were warnings, ominous but fairly common around the town. However, when a gun is presented in act 1, it is inevitable that it will fire in the second act, and the trigger that sent the bullet flying straight for the people was a kidnapping. The victim was one Ethan Wilson, 29 male cafe worker, and one of two adopted sons of Seth Wilson, the owner of The Bonfire Alehouse. Whatever happened to Ethan, but one thing is certain, the man responsible is a monster.*

Your (Hero or vigilante preferably) OC awakens in their home, sleeping on their bed comfortably. Rising from their bed, the morning sun seeped into their room, and the morning birds chirped joyfully and peacefully. They leave their room, maybe make their morning coffee, and prepare for a normal day, however that is when they spot it. They find a strange letter on the floor, beckoning them for a peak inside. As the envelope opened, they find a neatly written message for them, greeting them with their hero or vigilante’s alias. It was written quite formally, with a fancy signature at the bottom, and a plane ticket taped carefully next to the signature. Your OC reads the message, as they feel a strange aura surrounding it. As they read it, they can imagine the voice of a woman speaking in their ears, softly and calmly, but clearly hiding a lot of distress. Whatever has caused this strange woman to speak, it is most certainly supernatural or magic.

The message read as follows:

  
*‘Dear \[OC’s hero / vigilante name here\]*

*I apologise for* writing *this on such short notice, however with the situation down at The Sub Rosa Isles, I had barely anyone else to go to for help, and any time to actually call for help. You were the only one I thought could help do the job properly. As the mayor of Sub Rosa, it comes with a heavy heart to say this, however we need your help. Someone has brought chaos to my people’s lives, and it‘s up to you to save us. At the bottom of this note is a plane ticket to bring you here. When you arrive, you will be greeted by our best detective, he will assist you with your mission. Please, you’re my last hope for bringing this town back to its former glory and peace.*

*I hope to see you at a better time - Mayor Cassandra Rosemary*

(Cough cough, time skip, cough cough)

Your Hero OC arrives at the Sub Rosa Airport, where they find a man wearing a tan trench coat, sitting on a bench. His gaze raises to meet theirs, as he stands up and approaches them. “You must be \[Your OC’s hero / vigilante name here\]. Come with me, it’s best we get to work quickly.” He states calmly, as he offers to shake your OC’s hand.

# Best Cup Holder for Walker 2025: Top Reviews & Guide

A cup holder for a walker is a simple yet invaluable accessory for individuals who rely on walkers for mobility. It provides a convenient and safe way to carry beverages, preventing spills and allowing users to keep their hands free for better balance and control. This seemingly small addition can significantly enhance independence and quality of life.

It stands out in the market due to its practicality and contributes to a safer and more comfortable walking experience.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The ideal cup holder for a walker should possess several key features to ensure functionality and user satisfaction.

**Secure Attachment Mechanism:** Crucial for stability, the attachment mechanism should securely fasten the cup holder to the walker's frame without slipping or wobbling. Look for adjustable clamps, straps with strong velcro, or other reliable systems designed to accommodate various walker frame sizes and shapes. The goal is to maintain a firm grip even on uneven surfaces.

Many cup holders utilize adjustable clamps that can be tightened or loosened to fit different walker tube diameters. Some premium models feature quick-release mechanisms for easy attachment and removal, allowing users to quickly switch the cup holder between different walkers or store it when not in use. High-quality materials, such as durable plastics or metal alloys, are essential for a long-lasting and secure attachment.

**Universal Compatibility:** The cup holder needs to accommodate a wide range of cup and bottle sizes. A versatile design should feature adjustable grips or flexible materials that can securely hold small water bottles, large travel mugs, and even items like pill bottles or small containers.

Look for cup holders with an internal diameter of at least 3.5 inches to accommodate larger cups. Some models include adjustable inserts or flexible arms that conform to the shape of the container, preventing slippage and spills. Universal compatibility ensures that the cup holder remains useful regardless of the user's preferred beverage container.

**Durable Construction:** The cup holder must be constructed from durable materials that can withstand daily use and exposure to various weather conditions. Weather-resistant plastics or rust-proof metals are ideal choices to prevent damage and ensure longevity.

High-impact plastics, such as ABS or polypropylene, are commonly used for their durability and resistance to cracking. Metal cup holders, often made from aluminum or stainless steel, offer even greater strength and resistance to corrosion. Reinforced designs with sturdy bases and secure joints are essential for withstanding the rigors of daily use.

**Easy Cleaning:** Spills are inevitable, so the cup holder should be easy to clean. A smooth surface and simple design will prevent the buildup of dirt and debris. Removable inserts or dishwasher-safe materials further simplify the cleaning process.

Cup holders with smooth, non-porous surfaces are easier to wipe clean. Some models feature drainage holes to prevent liquid from pooling in the bottom. Removable inserts allow for thorough cleaning and can be easily replaced if damaged or worn.

**Spill-Resistant Design:** A well-designed cup holder should minimize the risk of spills, even when navigating uneven terrain. Deep cup wells, secure grips, and stable mounting mechanisms all contribute to a spill-resistant design.

Look for cup holders with deep cup wells that can securely hold taller containers. Rubberized grips or flexible arms can help to stabilize the container and prevent it from tipping over. A stable mounting mechanism that minimizes wobbling is crucial for reducing the risk of spills, especially when traversing uneven surfaces.

**Lightweight and Non-Interfering:** The cup holder should be lightweight to avoid adding unnecessary weight to the walker, and its design should not interfere with the user's movement or the walker's functionality.

Lightweight materials, such as plastic or aluminum, are ideal for minimizing the added weight. The cup holder should be positioned in a location that does not obstruct the user's hands or interfere with the folding mechanism of the walker. A low-profile design can further reduce the risk of interference and ensure that the cup holder remains out of the way when not in use.

Key features of the ideal cup holder for a walker include:
* Secure attachment mechanism
* Universal compatibility
* Durable construction
* Easy cleaning
* Spill-resistant design
* Lightweight and non-interfering

 ## Core Benefits

**Enhanced Independence:** A cup holder allows walker users to carry beverages independently, freeing up their hands for improved balance and maneuverability. This reduces reliance on others and promotes a greater sense of self-sufficiency.

Imagine being able to enjoy a cup of coffee while taking a morning stroll without needing assistance. The ability to carry a drink safely and conveniently empowers users to maintain their independence and enjoy everyday activities with greater ease.

**Improved Safety:** By keeping hands free, a cup holder significantly reduces the risk of falls and accidents. Users can maintain a secure grip on their walker, improving stability and control, especially on uneven surfaces or in crowded environments.

Holding a beverage while using a walker can compromise balance and increase the likelihood of a fall. A cup holder eliminates this risk, allowing users to maintain a firm grip on their walker and navigate their surroundings safely. This is particularly important for individuals with mobility impairments or balance issues.

**Increased Convenience:** Having a drink readily accessible eliminates the need to stop and search for a place to set it down, making errands and outings more convenient and enjoyable. This simple addition can significantly improve the overall experience of using a walker.

Whether running errands, visiting friends, or simply enjoying a walk in the park, a cup holder provides convenient access to beverages. No more searching for a stable surface or relying on others to hold your drink. The cup holder offers a simple yet effective solution for staying hydrated and comfortable while on the go.

**Reduced Spills and Messes:** A secure and well-designed cup holder minimizes the risk of spills, preventing messy accidents and potential injuries. This keeps both the user and their surroundings clean and safe.

Spilled beverages can create slippery surfaces and pose a safety hazard. A cup holder with a spill-resistant design helps to prevent these accidents, keeping both the user and their surroundings clean and safe. This is particularly important for individuals with limited mobility or dexterity.

 ## FAQs Section

**Will this cup holder fit my specific walker model?**
  Most cup holders designed for walkers are made with universal compatibility in mind. They typically feature adjustable clamps or straps that can accommodate a wide range of walker frame sizes and shapes.

**Is the cup holder durable enough for daily use?**
  The durability of a cup holder depends on the materials and construction quality. Look for cup holders made from durable plastics, rust-proof metals, or other weather-resistant materials. A sturdy base, secure joints, and reinforced design are also indicators of durability. Reading customer reviews can provide valuable insights into the long-term performance and reliability of a particular cup holder model.

**Can this cup holder accommodate different sizes of cups and bottles?**
  A good cup holder should be versatile enough to accommodate a variety of cup and bottle sizes. Look for models with adjustable grips, flexible arms, or expandable wells that can securely hold small water bottles, large travel mugs, and even items like pill bottles or small containers. Checking the product specifications for the maximum diameter and depth of the cup holder can help you determine if it will meet your specific needs.

I have no self control around little purchases like boba and coffee.,"Hello, I'm a uni student in the UK and I keep dipping into my overdraft. I'm looking for advice on avoiding spending, because I want to stop being in my OD to get out of the habit before I graduate.

At its worst I was £1500 in debt (maxed out), now I'm at about -150 and get paid on Monday. Last month I'd budgeted to have £200 spare but I ended up spending it all and I'm tired of being in this loop and being stressed about money!

I appreciate it could be much worse.

Currently my student loan pays for my rent and I make about £800 a month on top of that with my job. Bills (subscriptions, car insurance, gym membership) come to about £200 a month and I seem to spend about £120 a month on food. £40/mo on fuel. About 40/mo on train tickets for my boyfriend to visit. The remaining amount is going towards my sister (I owe ~700) and my boyfriend (I owe ~450) both of whom have said to take my time in paying it back but I still owe that much because I've taken ages. I'm aiming for £100 a month each if possible.

I spend a lot of money on little purchases like boba, coffee, snacks, makeup, mostly just ""little treats"" to a ridiculous proportion. For a while I was good at saying no, I don't need it, especially as I can get free coffee at the coffee place I work at but I honestly just don't think about the money until it's too late, which is made worse by the fact that 2FA makes checking my bank info so awkward lol.

Does anyone have any advice? I don't think I'm in a position where I need to increase my income but I want to start saving as my degree funding goes down next year and I'd rather not work extra hours. I'm tired of being constantly stressed about money.

My husband and I will be moving to Shenzhen soon and have accepted jobs in Nanshan District. We previously lived in Fuzhou for five years, but we know Shenzhen is much bigger and busier, so we would love some advice!

We understand Nanshan is a desirable (and pricey) area. We’d appreciate any tips about:
	•	Good neighborhoods or streets for a quieter vibe, ideally near parks or green spaces (who doesn’t want that, right?).
	•	Areas that are convenient for commuting, but not too far from supermarkets, coffee shops, shopping malls, and restaurants.
	•	Any places to be mindful of or avoid?
	•	Whether newer builds are strongly preferred over older ones (in Fuzhou, old builds were often very worn down).
	•	Reasonable rental prices for a 2-bedroom apartment in Nanshan.
	•	How common are loft-style apartments?
	•	How competitive is the rental market right now?

We’ll mainly be using public transport to get around, so being near a metro station would be a big plus.

Any and all advice would be very appreciated! Thank you so much in advance!",3,1745658949.0,chinalife,6,1.0,False

**Automated Grind Adjustment:** Some premium coffee machines incorporate sensors that analyze bean density and automatically adjust the grinder settings for optimal particle size.

This feature eliminates the guesswork involved in dialing in the perfect grind, allowing for consistent extraction regardless of bean variety or age. The machines learn from each brewing cycle, refining the grind settings over time to achieve optimal results.

 ## Core Benefits

A great cup of coffee offers more than just a caffeine kick; it provides a sensory experience that enhances productivity, fosters social connections, and contributes to overall well-being.

**Improved Focus & Productivity:** The caffeine in coffee stimulates the central nervous system, improving alertness and concentration. Studies show that moderate coffee consumption can enhance cognitive performance, leading to increased productivity at work or during study sessions. A well-crafted cup, enjoyed mindfully, can also promote a sense of calm focus, setting the stage for effective task management.

**Enhanced Social Connection:** Coffee shops serve as gathering places for friends, colleagues, and community members, fostering social interaction and connection. Sharing a cup of coffee can create a relaxed and inviting atmosphere for conversation, collaboration, and relationship building. The ritual of brewing and enjoying coffee together can also strengthen bonds and create shared experiences.

**Elevated Sensory Experience:** High-quality coffee, prepared with care, offers a complex and rewarding sensory experience. The aroma, taste, and mouthfeel of coffee can stimulate the senses, providing moments of pleasure and relaxation. Exploring different bean origins and brewing methods allows coffee enthusiasts to discover a wide range of flavor profiles, from fruity and floral to chocolatey and nutty.

**Increased Energy Levels:** Coffee provides a natural boost of energy, helping to combat fatigue and improve physical performance. The caffeine in coffee increases adrenaline levels, preparing the body for physical activity and enhancing endurance. Enjoying a cup of coffee before a workout or during a physically demanding task can improve stamina and reduce perceived exertion.

 ## FAQs Section

Navigating the world of coffee can be confusing, with numerous brewing methods, bean varieties, and technical specifications to consider. Here are some frequently asked questions to help you make informed choices.

**What is the difference between Arabica and Robusta beans?**

Arabica beans are generally considered higher quality, offering a smoother, more aromatic flavor with a higher acidity. Robusta beans are bolder and more bitter, with a higher caffeine content. They are often used in espresso blends for their crema-producing properties.

**What is the best grind size for different brewing methods?**

Coarse grinds are best for French press and cold brew, medium grinds for drip coffee makers and pour-over, and fine grinds for espresso. Using the wrong grind size can lead to under-extraction (sour, weak coffee) or over-extraction (bitter, harsh coffee).

**How important is water quality for brewing coffee?**

Water quality plays a significant role in the taste of coffee. Filtered water, free from chlorine and other impurities, is recommended. The ideal water temperature for brewing is between 195-205掳F (90-96掳C).

**How should I store coffee beans to maintain freshness?**

Coffee beans should be stored in an airtight container, away from light, heat, and moisture. Storing beans in the freezer can extend their shelf life, but it's important to thaw them completely before grinding to prevent condensation from affecting the grind quality.

I’ve been trying to grow our Instagram organically, consistent reels, stories, polls, you name it.

Yesterday, I decided to experiment and boosted one of our recent reels. I kept it simple:

* Targeted people interested in chocolate, iced drinks, coffee and healthy snacking
* Budget: 173 INR Per day
* Duration: 1 day(as I have plans to analyse and edit as per the requirements)
* Geography: Bangalore, Hyderabad, Delhi Ncr, Mumbai
* Goal: Redirect the audience to a specific landing page of on my website to increase sales 

Here’s what happened so far:

* Reach: it increased from 1300 to around 10K
* Follower growth: 1 
* Website clicks (if any): 218 website visits
* Sales (if any): 0 from the ad 

Honestly, I’m torn. While the reel did get more eyeballs, the quality of engagement feels... mixed. A good number of links and website visits but not much interaction.

I’d love to hear from others who’ve boosted reels, Did it actually help you build a community, increase sales? Or just gave short bursts of vanity metrics? And if you have anydo's *or* don’ts when boosting content, I’m all ears!

This is going to be very long so I apologise in advance but I’m going to explain everything that I’ve been feeling. 

Okay so I started my period at 12/13 years old and I remember when I started my periods they were extremely heavy from the get go and my acne flared up bad. I’d remember changing my pads constantly. So my mum took me to the doctors and I was put on the pill which made my acne calm down and my periods lighter and easier to deal with. I was on the pill throughout high school but I’m gonna be honest I was a real pain at taking them and mum would shout at me to not forget them so that messed my cycles up bad. My periods were irregular for a while throughout college but I’d never fully missed a month I only missed a month once after my first ever period. I think I stopped taking the pill once I finished high school as I was getting bad side effects like migraines was the biggest one. 

Fast forward to about two years ago and this is when my problems ramp up to 100. So my periods have always been quite painful, I always found it difficult to stand for a long length of time because of the pain in my thighs so would have to sit down in work. But in August 2023 I went to a festival and unfortunately I was due my period during this time. I could feel it coming on and at the same time I decided to smoke a joint. The cramps start coming in and it’s painful but fine and then all of a sudden I’m hit with what could only be described as labour like contractions to the point it winds me. I had to lie down in the tent and I couldn’t move for like three hours straight and I remember my best friend asking if I was okay and she was like “I’ve never had period pain where I can’t move” I put it down to the weed enhancing the cramps to x1000 (even tho it should technically do the opposite lmao) and I just didn’t think anything of it but defo thought it was weird and I never wanted to experience that level of pain again. HOWEVER let’s fast forward a few months to march 2024 now my periods start to get irregular again, we’re talking a few days late then she decides to arrive in her own time that sort of thing and my flo app was like ??? Thinking back I was getting pains in my legs and hips and all sorts but I was putting that down to the exercising I was doing, so again I didn’t think anything of it. So I’m walking to Costa for a cheeky little coffee because I have work and I walk pretty fast and as I get towards Costa I’m suddenly once again hit with the most painful debilitating contraction barbed wire like cramps I’ve ever felt in the middle of the street. ATP I’m limping into the cafe, feeling like I would be better crawling to the counter to ask for my vanilla iced latte. After my order, my ears start ringing the cramps are getting unbearable and I start to feel that faint way and I was like “I’m gonna go in front of this counter” and low and behold I keel over the counter slipping out of consciousness. The girls at the counter bless them led me over to the couch and got me water when I came round and they asked if I needed an ambulance but me being me putting work first I was like “no no don’t do that I have work” the cramps are still awful and I’m writhing in my seat downing these glasses of water that the girls kept giving me hoping it would magically give me some relief. I was going to miss my train so I walked another five minutes to the train station but every step was agony and I was angry I was feeling these pains yet again. The next day, my period comes in full force heaviness, I bled through my pad, the amount of pants I had to wash was unbelievable. I started to suspect something wasn’t right as this pain was aligning with my period but this debilitating pain would only happen a few times a year. Every other period is also painful and always has been but never to that extent. A few months later I had it again but luckily it only lasted about an hour while I was on the train (again it was triggered by me walking only like 8 mins) later that day my period starts. Every period atp even tho I didn’t have the labour like contractions I was feeling it in my thighs to the point I could barely stand, my groin lymph nodes were having a party. A few months ago my period decided she couldn’t wait a whole month to visit me and decided to rock up 21 days into my cycle which is RARE for me and I had a feeling because I was feeling pre menstrual right after my period so there was basically two weeks between my periods I was PISSED 😭 so I logged it into my flo and the app was immediately like “girl what the hell your last cycle was 36 days”. 

November 2024, I wake up and the first thing I felt was the cramps and I was like “oh I guess she’s here” once I sit up, here it comes the most excruciating labour like contractions, like someone’s pulling a tight belt around my pelvis, wrapping my organs in barbed wire along with burning them with hot rods. I hobble out of my bedroom over to the bathroom and they just get worse and worse to the point I felt physically nauseous and I start vomiting. Mums cooking breakfast so she’s none of the wiser I’m practically fighting for my life in the bathroom. I then try and stand up and as I’m walking to the living room I felt that faint way again, I’m sweating, my vision starts to blur and boom, I collapse onto the couch and I was out for like twenty seconds. Mum was trying to wake me up calling my name and I come round to my two cats sat in front of me staring at me in concern. Mum starts throwing me paracetamol, shoving water into my mouth and once I finally make the effort to go to the bathroom here’s my period and it was honestly like that scene from the shining, she was HEAVVYYYY. And for three hours straight afterwards I had to lie on the couch being still as possible while I was having basically labour contractions it would get worse then it would get better then it would get worse until it subsided and I was fine afterwards just absolutely exhausted. By then my mum knew something was wrong so she told me I need to go to the doctors. 

So before we go into the doctors I need to give you some side stories and backgrounds about my family. So my gran had womb cancer six years ago they knew something was wrong doing a pelvic examination and within a week she got a scan which confirmed it and she got surgery the following week and was immediately in remission so they caught it super fast. My mum actually had an ultrasound scan two years ago as she was still getting periods (my mum is in her 60s and yes it’s not common but it happens) when she had her scan they found loads of cysts on her uterus, ovaries, everywhere. My mum is still having problems so she went back to the doctor and had her follow up scan pushed up. She had that a few months ago and her results came back, loads more cysts had popped up, some looked a bit abnormal so she had to get bloods done to check for cancer (they came back fine so she’s all clear for that) she also has fibroids and they also found endometriosis they asked if she was aware she had endo and she said no but thinking back she had trouble conceiving but she never had the period pain to the extent I get it. As far as I know my aunt (apart from chronic discharge) and my half-sister don’t have any problems. 

So I go to the doctors, I’ve listed all of my symptoms, I’m ready. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a doctor I saw, it was a practitioner nurse. The first thing she asked me was if I wanted to go back onto the pill but I told her the reasons I came off it was because I started to get side affects from it and all honesty I wasn’t the best at keeping up with taking them and I didn’t want to mess up my hormones. So she prescribed me with Mefenamic acid. She kept mentioning the pill and I knew I was beginning to get fobbed off so I hit her with the family history and immediately she referred me for an ultrasound scan and to check my bloods for my hormone levels. ATP this was before I knew my mum had endo so I just mentioned the cysts and the nurse was looking up PCOS symptoms which I’ve already gone over myself, I don’t think I have it but hey ho. So I left and got the mefenamic acid and BOYYYYY that is harsh on your stomach. Even taking it with or after food as requested I felt like I was gonna vomit it back up and I also felt dizzy after taking it. I had to admit it made my flow a little lighter but the pain was still pushing through. I also got my bloods done and guess what? They came back normal. And another guess what? It was the receptionist that told me that not an actual doctor 😍. So I thought great if my hormone levels are fine then there must be nothing wrong with me but I have heard peoples bloods have come back fine and they have endo and all sorts so I’m not losing hope. 

So another side note about a year and a half ago my acne flared up to the worst it’s ever been. Redness, sandpaper, painful skin to the point I was getting comments from kids while at work going “why have you got all them spots on your face” being humbled by a five year old is not it 😭 I wash my face twice a day, I’ve used every skin care product under the sun and nothing had worked. So my doctor gave me Skinoren which I have to say has worked wonders, the antibiotics? Eh I didn’t notice that much of a difference and noticed my body starting to reject them after a while of taking them which was fabulous. However this past month and a half I’ve noticed my skin flaring up again to a rash like look and I’ve noticed this past month I’ve been in a lot of pain even outside my period, it’ll come and go and the pain can be mild and then jump to really bad for maybe a few mins throughout the day. It ranges from dull ache to a sudden stabbing pain especially in the ovary area. So whether I’m having a flare up who knows 😭

The bowel movements I’ve also noticed. I’ve had trouble with pooping for as long as I can remember tbh my body just doesn’t know how to poop normally and when I found out from basically everyone that not pooping every day isn’t normal I was shocked. I can go days without pooping and even when I am pooping every day it’s a STRAIN and a half to get it out and they’re always that constipation style poop (very sorry for the tmi) I also bloat all the time to the point I look six months pregnant especially before my period and after any food I ever have and often find myself in pain and discomfort after a main meal. I’ve tried going gluten free thinking that was the issue and never noticed a difference unfortunately. 

I’ve also had pain during sex all the time, just uncomfortable, painful and I’m always bleeding afterwards. I also can’t wear tampons, again, way too painful to insert them up there. 

Another thing I’ve been noticing especially recently is my lymph nodes play up around period and ovulation. The one under my jaw goes sore during ovulation and subsides afterwards and the ones in my neck and groin go sore during my period and then subside a few days after my period ends (I have no idea whether this is linked to endo or anything and google certainly isn’t helpful that just keeps telling me I need to plan my funeral). 

The one reason I started thinking about endo was the pain outside of my periods that I’ve been noticing maybe the past year and a half. As I said before it can vary. I’ll have a moment of few mins where it feels like I’m getting repeatedly stabbed in my pelvis with a knife and then it randomly goes and I’m left with an ache. Sometimes I’ll have a deep throb in my pelvis, thighs and hips. I’ve also been getting electric shock zaps in my butt and in my vagina this can happen all cycle round too. All I can describe it is like someone’s putting a taser up my vagina it’ll last for 30 seconds and then go but it’s HORRIBLE. Yesterday was quite bad I felt what could only be described as a pressure in my lower pelvis close to my vagina like someone was sitting on it and every time I walked my right hip was killing me and it felt like it was coming out of place. I was so uncomfortable sitting on the train like sitting wasn’t relieving the pressure at all. I’ve also noticed very tender points near my ovaries and pelvis when I press down on it. And this past week especially has been so hard to stand for a prolonged length of time in work I’m constantly having to sit down because the pain and weakness in my legs is too much. I’m also getting shooting pains from my ovary area that goes down to my knees even to my feet. I’ve also experienced numbness in my legs if I sit a certain way. 

So I rang referral because atp it’s been two months since I was referred for a scan and I’ve heard nothing. They hit back with “it’ll be seven months wait” and I burst into tears saying “I couldn’t wait seven months is there any way you can push it up” and she said what she could do was give her my number and she’ll pass it on so any cancellations the hospital will contact me directly. She also advised me to go back to the doctors and they could make my scan urgent. So I went back to the doctors on Thursday and it was the same practitioner nurse I saw last time, she prescribed me with paracetamol. PARACETAMOL. Which does fuck all for my pain. When I was near crying she then said she was gonna prescribe me codeine and only to take that when the pain is terrible because codeine can be very addictive and make you drowsy. She also referred me to a gynaecologist. I asked her how long that would be and she said “the waiting times are super long at the moment so I couldn’t tell you”. I left the doctors feeling so deflated and went home and cried my eyes out. Then my guardian angel decides to give me a break because I get a call from the hospital and they said they had a cancellation for a scan this weekend and I was like “I WILL TAKE IT! YES!” Constantly thanking the radiologist that called me and he was laughing bless 😭

I will conclude this now because this has become an essay. But I’m currently downing litres of water before my scan soon. I know endo doesn’t really show up on scans, it did for my mum but it’s different for everyone. I hope at least it’ll show cysts or something so I don’t feel like I’m losing my mind with this constant pain and exhaustion. I just want to know if anyone diagnosed with endo has gone through the same thing I am. I want to mention the extremely debilitating periods only happen a few times a year so I call it Russian roulette because I don’t know when the labour contractions will strike next but even when they don’t my periods are still horrible and my hot water bottle is my best friend. I just want to feel heard and seen and that it’s not in my head and the pain is very real. Once again, thank you all for reading this I know it was long but I wanted to make sure to include everything so you all have an idea of what it is I’m going through and what’s causing this pain and whether it does sound like endo.

1k88fmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_spendopay/comments/1k88fmh/why_bitcoin_outshines_gold_as_a_modern_investment/,Why Bitcoin Outshines Gold as a Modern Investment,"For centuries, gold has been the ultimate safe-haven asset — a symbol of wealth, security, and permanence. But in the 21st century, a new contender has entered the ring: **Bitcoin**.  
As the world shifts toward digital finance, Bitcoin is quickly proving to be not just a modern alternative, but a superior investment altogether. Here's why Bitcoin is outshining gold in today’s economy:

# 1. Performance: Bitcoin Leaves Gold in the Dust

Gold has offered slow, steady gains — but Bitcoin has delivered life-changing returns.  
Since its inception, Bitcoin’s price growth has outpaced gold by a staggering margin. For investors seeking real wealth creation rather than just preservation, Bitcoin has been the clear winner.

# 2. Scarcity: Programmed and Predictable

Gold is rare, but its supply is unpredictable — new mines or technologies could flood the market.  
Bitcoin, however, is **mathematically capped at 21 million coins**. No more, ever. And thanks to Bitcoin’s halving cycles, its scarcity **increases over time**, creating built-in upward pressure on its value.

# 3. Portability: Bitcoin Goes Wherever You Go

A bag of gold is heavy, expensive to move, and vulnerable to theft.  
Bitcoin lives securely on the blockchain, accessible **anywhere with an internet connection**. Whether you’re moving across a city or across continents, your Bitcoin moves with you — instantly, safely, and at minimal cost.

# 4. Transparency: Trust the Code, Not the Middleman

Gold ownership often relies on trust — certificates, vaults, and third-party verification.  
Bitcoin transactions are fully **transparent and verifiable** on the public blockchain. No intermediaries. No guessing. Just pure, open-source trust.

# 5. Flexibility: Bitcoin for Everyone, Everywhere

You can divide Bitcoin down to **one hundred millionth** of a coin (one satoshi), making it perfect for transactions of any size.  
Gold? Not exactly convenient when you want to buy a coffee or split a payment with a friend.

# 6. Independence: True Financial Freedom

Bitcoin isn’t controlled by any government, bank, or institution. It’s **decentralized**, offering users true financial sovereignty.  
Gold, while independent to a degree, is still deeply tied to traditional financial systems and institutions.

# 7. Designed for the Digital Future

Bitcoin isn’t just a store of value; it’s a platform for innovation — powering decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and more.  
Gold is static. Bitcoin is **evolving with the internet economy**.

# 8. Spend Bitcoin Like Cash: The Power of [**Spendo.com**](http://Spendo.com)

Owning Bitcoin today doesn’t mean waiting years to use it. Thanks to [Spendo.com](https://spendo.com/), you can **buy Bitcoin and instantly link it to a debit card**.  
This makes it possible to **spend Bitcoin anywhere Visa or Mastercard are accepted** — groceries, gas, travel, dining out.  
With Spendo, Bitcoin becomes **everyday money**, not just a long-term investment. It brings the future of finance into your wallet right now.

# Final Thoughts: Bitcoin Is the New Gold

Gold will always have its place. But Bitcoin is built for the world we live in — **global, digital, fast-moving, and borderless**.  
As a store of value, a hedge against inflation, and now as a daily spending tool, Bitcoin offers opportunities that gold simply can’t match.  
For investors thinking ahead, Bitcoin isn’t just an alternative — **it’s the evolution of money itself**.",1,1745657066.0,u_spendopay,0,1.0,False

1k88e90,https://www.reddit.com/r/QualitySeek/comments/1k88e90/what_are_the_best_nonkeurig_singleserve_coffee/,What Are the Best Non-Keurig Single-Serve Coffee Makers Available in America Within a $200–$350 Budget?,"Finding the right coffee maker can be a challenging task, particularly when users are seeking alternatives to well-known brands like Keurig while still desiring the convenience of single-serve brewing. In this situation, the individual is looking for a coffee machine that is compatible with Keurig-style pods but is not manufactured by Keurig itself. The desired price range falls between $200 and $350, with an emphasis on value for money—meaning a preference for machines priced closer to the lower end of the budget whenever possible.

A major aspect of this search involves identifying brands that offer reliable, durable, and high-performing machines that can use K-Cup-compatible pods. Fortunately, several reputable brands have developed machines that fill this niche, often outperforming Keurig’s own devices in build quality, temperature control, and brewing consistency. Brands such as Breville, Cuisinart, and Hamilton Beach offer strong alternatives. For example, the Breville BKC700XL was previously considered an outstanding non-Keurig single-serve machine, although it has become harder to find new. Today, Cuisinart’s SS-10P1 Premium Single-Serve Coffee Maker stands out as a top option. It is fully compatible with K-Cups, has a reusable filter for ground coffee, adjustable brew temperature, multiple cup sizes, and a large water reservoir, all for a price well within the specified budget. Another worthy consideration is the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which not only uses K-Cups but also allows brewing with ground coffee, providing flexibility in beverage choice while maintaining a price point under $200.

To address this request professionally, it is important to advise not only on product selection but also on key considerations for long-term satisfaction. Firstly, prioritize models offering a strong warranty and accessible customer service, as single-serve machines can develop mechanical issues over time. Secondly, temperature control is a crucial feature; brewing at the correct temperature (around 195–205°F) ensures better flavor extraction and a richer cup of coffee. Thirdly, it is highly recommended to select a machine that has a removable water reservoir and accessible internal components, making routine descaling and cleaning easier, which extends the life of the machine.

In conclusion, while Keurig dominates the single-serve market, there are excellent alternatives from brands like Cuisinart and Hamilton Beach that meet the requirements specified. The Cuisinart SS-10P1 in particular offers durability, performance, and flexibility well-suited for a budget-conscious consumer. Choosing a model with a strong warranty, superior brewing temperature control, and ease of maintenance will guarantee a satisfying and long-lasting investment. This professional approach ensures the best possible coffee experience without the limitations or concerns associated with the original Keurig brand.

I’ve just come back from a trip to the north of Luzon and the faces and advertisements are even there, plastered all over the remote villages amongst the rice terraces etc. 
A few weeks back, headed for coffee in Manila, I stumbled into an enormous procession of cars and bikes following a truck of musicians, all promoting some local political figure. I’m British, so just the show and noise of it all, let alone just how long this goes on for, is very unusual and alien to me, but perhaps the most jarring are the stories I’m told from all over the country of ‘donations’ and straight up cash gifts to buy votes.

As many people here perhaps have Philippine partners and families, and long time friendships with people from every corner of the country, I’m just generally curious about how your experience with it all (if you even give it any attention) and just really what are some of the crazier things you’ve heard about stuff that goes on?

I was told by a foreigner that a few years ago, him and his wife scored a piece of beach front land on the relative cheap, because a local political figure needed to raise cash for their election run.

1k882u1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1k882u1/for_shelbob_high_school_ex_m28/,For Shelbob; High School Ex (M28),"Lately, my heart feels heavier than usual. This has been weighing on me for a year now.

When I was 13, I was diagnosed with a brain AVM, which led to seizures and a minor stroke. I was pulled out of school and placed in home education because I was terrified of having a seizure in public—of being seen as a freak, of being laughed at. It was a near-death experience, and it changed everything. I went through physical therapy all the way through high school just to regain some sense of normalcy in my left side. The fear never left. The anxiety from it often triggered more seizures, and I felt like no one was really there for me.

I only had one real relationship before all of this—a childhood girlfriend I’d been with for years. We eventually went our separate ways at 16, like first loves often do. That break pushed me to be more social, to try and open up. That’s when I met a girl named “Shelbob.”

She’d just moved from Ohio to Florida and was a bit of an outsider too. We connected over games, anime, and a shared sense of brokenness. She had her own medical struggles—breathing problems and the effects of medication that caused weight gain—but I never cared about any of that. To me, it was always about someone’s soul. And with her, I felt seen, despite everything.

She made an effort—enrolled in my classes, wanted to spend time with me. Eventually, she wanted to take the next step in our relationship—to lose our virginity to each other. I wanted to, truly. But just before we would start, I’d panic. I was terrified—not of her, but of what my body might do. What if I had a seizure during something so intimate? What if I ruined everything in the worst way? She didn’t understand, and she got frustrated.

My AVM was eventually deemed no longer a risk, and I finally found the courage to share that first experience with someone else—before New Year’s”

Then came the betrayal.

She cheated on me in her hometown, in a McDonald's parking lot, with a guy who, of all things, shared my name. It was confirmed by mutual friends—on Christmas, no less. Then she spread lies about me, turning the small circle of acquaintances. She tried to justify it later, saying she felt neglected and that it happened in the heat of the moment. She asked me to forgive her and said things would be different.

I couldn’t.

She kept reaching out—birthday messages, gifts, spamming GTA invites, trying to show she still cared. Part of me wanted to forgive her. But around that time, my dad was arrested and could be facing five years, and I found out my childhood girlfriend had developed cancer... and passed away.

I didn’t want to drag Shelbob into that grief. I didn’t want to rebuild something broken when I was mentally shattered. So we moved on and dated other people.

Fast forward to 2020. COVID hit. Everyone was isolated and online. I got on Tinder one night and saw her again. She claimed she was on Ambien, swiping without thinking. But we started talking again—slowly at first, then fully catching up. She told me about her plans to move to Colorado (Later Tampa, FL) with a guy friend she was considering living with. I had my dreams, looking into Boston as a Digital Marketer and advancing my Photography career.

Then came the truth—she said she wasn’t ready for a relationship. But the way she described this “guy friend,” it was clear there was more going on. Still, she wanted to meet for coffee.

I put my resentment aside for that moment. I knew deep down this would be the last time I’d ever see her. We talked for two hours. I didn’t get into the heavy things—I didn’t see the point. I knew she’d already chosen her path.

The last thing I said to her was:  
**“I forgive you, but I can’t forget what you did.”**

We left. We never spoke again.

Today, “Shelbob” is married to that same guy, and they’ve just celebrated the birth of their first child.

I’m in a two-year relationship with someone truly wonderful. I lost over 140 pounds and am now sitting at the healthiest place in my life. We’re even starting to talk about marriage. She’s the one who encouraged me to write all of this out.

If by some chance you ever come across this, Shelbob—this is for you.

It’s strange, but despite everything you did, I still care about you. It might be silly, but it’s true.  
Even though the door between us is permanently closed, I’m genuinely glad you found happiness.  
Our story was a tragic one, but there were beautiful, humble memories I’ll never forget:  
The Universal trip with your parents (me losing your mother's glasses).  
Homecoming.  
Gaming sessions that stretched into the night.

Eventually, those memories will fade into the distance, like all things do. When we met at that coffee shop, I couldn’t tell you everything I was going through. I knew nothing I said would change the outcome. You had already made your decision. And I… I didn’t know how to speak my truth without falling apart. Why say more when I can cause more damage or tell you more about a person you're trying to forget? So I held it in, like I always have. I'm sorry I couldn't tell you about my father, the dead ex or being what you wanted.

And because of that, we failed each other.

I thought about messaging you again after I heard about the baby—on PlayStation, maybe, or through social media. But I figured the last person you'd want to hear from is me.

So this is me, quietly stepping out of your orbit, and by chance you're in my orbit. I hope this finds you.

I wish you nothing but the best in motherhood.",1,1745655503.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

My Siemens EQ6 plus S300 has been causing problems for 2 days. Normally, it rinses out after switching on and then lets you choose the desired coffee.

Now it doesn't rinse through after switching on and the first coffee is inedible. First comes cold broth, then it foams out of the issue and at some point the actual coffee comes. If the coffee machine turns off automatically and I turn it back on afterwards, the machine rinses again and the coffee comes normally.

1k881qd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k881qd,It’s Been a While Since My Last Theater Visit! Felt Like a True Adult 🎬📚,"Hey everyone!
I finally went to the movie theater after a long time, and it really made me feel like a proper adult. Back in the day, going to the theater was just a casual outing with friends, but now it feels like a special moment to enjoy my own time with a sense of calm and leisure.

The first photo is from the entrance of a CGV Arthouse theater. The interior design is so sleek and modern—I felt my mood lift the moment I walked in. The wooden ceiling with steel structures and the lighting created such a warm yet trendy vibe. There’s an ‘A TWOSOME PLACE’ café right next to the entrance, which was perfect for grabbing a coffee and relaxing before the movie.

The second photo shows a bookshelf in the theater lobby, and I was genuinely impressed by it! The entire wall was filled with books, and the combination of brick walls, soft lighting, and plants scattered around gave off a cozy library-café vibe. I could see the book titles—there were film-related books, classic novels, and more, which really caught my eye. The ‘DREAM ON’ decoration and movie posters added to the overall atmosphere.

The last photo is of the CGV Arthouse sign at the entrance. It had both Korean and English text, which made it feel even more aesthetic. There was a phrase that read “Korean Film Life Masterpiece Project,” which I think is an event to reflect on iconic scenes from Korean movies. The large book models next to it were super cute too.

I watched Parasite again, and as expected, a masterpiece never gets old. The theater seats were comfortable, and the sound quality was amazing, making the experience so immersive. After the movie, I sat down with a coffee, soaking in the afterglow, and that moment felt so precious to me.
Being an adult, I’ve come to appreciate these small joys so much more. Have any of you been to the theater recently? What movie did you watch, and how do you like to spend these kinds of leisurely moments? I’d love to hear about it! 😊",1,1745655367.0,Adulting,0,1.0,False
