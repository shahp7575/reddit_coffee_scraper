1nooywr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nooywr,Have I ruined my compost with bleached coffee filters?,"I purchased a pack of coffee filters not realizing they were white / bleached.  I had already opened the box and didn't want to be wasteful, so when using them I would just compost the coffee grounds and put the filters in the garbage. 

Then about 5 weeks ago some ""distracting life events"" happened, and I stopped separating them and just put it all in the compost. I only *just* realized my ongoing error, and about 35 bleached filters are now throughout my compost (I turned it recently).

Have I ruined my whole compost pile with the chlorine/bleach in the filters? Or is 35 filters across an 82 gallon compost bin diluted enough to not be harmful to my garden? 

The photo is from my main compost - the first finished batch I have had and am quite proud of it! Thankfully, it does NOT have these filters in it. The second pic is of the offending filters - which are in a separate smaller pile (once I empty the big bin of finished compost, I will turn this smaller pile into the big bin).

Thanks in advance for any advice!",1,1758651400.0,composting,0,1.0,False

Photos and timestamp:

https://photos.app.goo.gl/FSqVSqahVVDGUbAA8

This is a lesser-known machine produced by Quickmill in their ""Evolution"" line.

The 3240 includes TWO PID controlled thermoblock heaters, one for steaming and one for brewing. Yes, you can steam and brew at the same time on a 15amp 110v outlet. 

This machine also includes the obvious touch screen controller with programa le presets for 4 coffee options, two steaming options, and menu controls.

This machine also includes the coveted mechanical flow control knob also implemented on the popular ""Pop Up"" machine for on-the-fly flow control. 

It heats up in about 4 minutes, steams and brews at the same time, has flow control, PID, programmable brewing options, and is built like a tank with all stainless steel construction. 

I've upgraded some parts to allow the use of non-quickmill portafilter baskets (VST, IMS, etc.), and included are several spare bolts, silicone o-rings, and the originals. 

What's not to like? Well, I'll tell you what I don't like about it and why I'm not keeping it. 

1. The 58mm grouphead design uses a three-winged portafilter, but does not accommodate most aftermarket portafilters, so you must use one of the two included OEM options, neither of which are bottomless. 

2. Although I was able to swap some bolts and the grouphead O-ring to allow the use of non-quickmill baskets, this decreases the headspace in the basket so that a 20g basket may only be able to hold ~15g.

3. I had planned to do the Gagguino mod to this machine. I thought it was the perfect candidate, having an ugly touch-sensitive screen which I would replace with a more elegant and modern touch screen. However, I did not realize that the Gagguino support does not yet extend to thermoblock machines. I've decided to move on and pursue other projects instead.

- The tool lives under the Health Stats tab; users create custom ""behaviours"" tags such as caffeine, alcohol, heavy meal, stretching, or sauna.
- It is available to all Garmin Connect users with a heart‚Äërate‚Äëcapable watch, regardless of model or subscription tier, including free accounts.
- Users can enable reminders at chosen times (e.g., morning and evening) to prompt tag entry, and can also add, edit, or delete tags manually throughout the day.
- Benefits highlighted include clearer insight into how habits affect metrics, personalized tracking, more consistent logging, and the ability to test lifestyle changes for measurable effects on sleep or heart rate.
- Early adopters suggest starting with a small set of core tags and expanding as logging becomes routine.

Why it matters: Adding context turns raw biometric numbers into a usable narrative, helping users make informed wellness decisions.

1noos02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1noos02/quack_of_the_damned/,Quack of the Damned,"My wife left on a Monday morning, suitcase rolling behind her like a leash she couldn‚Äôt wait to snap. Five days, work trip, no big deal. I kissed her at the door, waved her off, and thought the week would be quiet. I thought wrong. 


That same night, I heard something shuffle in the kitchen. Figured it was the wind, or maybe a mouse, but when I flicked on the light there it was ‚Äî a duck. A regular duck except for one slick black feather bent wrong on its left wing. It stared at me like it knew me. Then it went wild. Shattered two glasses, knocked over the sugar jar, and bolted out the back before I could blink.



I laughed it off at first. Who gets invaded by a duck? But the next morning, it came back. Same black feather, same dead stare. This time it shredded the curtains and knocked my coffee across the counter like it was making a point. I chased it out with a broom, cussing, sweating, but it didn‚Äôt move like an animal ‚Äî more like it let me push it out. Like it was just playing with me.



By day three, I was boarding up windows. Hammer and nails, wood across the back door, the whole paranoid act. I didn‚Äôt care how it looked ‚Äî I just wanted peace. 


That night, around two a.m., I woke to flapping. Not outside. Inside. The duck tore through my living room like a hurricane in feathers, ripped cushions open, scattered foam like snow. The boards on the windows were still solid. I checked them. But the duck was there anyway, head cocked, black feather twitching like a signal. It left claw marks on the TV screen before it vanished again.



By Thursday I wasn‚Äôt laughing anymore. I barely slept. I sat in a chair with my father‚Äôs old rifle across my lap, waiting. The boards held, the doors locked, but the duck didn‚Äôt need openings. It came straight down the chimney that night, coughing soot all over the carpet, flapping like some demon in disguise. I fired once ‚Äî missed ‚Äî and the shot tore a hole in the ceiling. The duck waddled around the blast like it didn‚Äôt care. When it finally left, the silence felt worse than the noise.



Friday it didn‚Äôt show. I thought maybe I‚Äôd scared it off, maybe the boards or the bullet had done the trick. But when my wife came home Saturday morning, suitcase rolling in, she stopped cold at the mess. Curtains shredded, ceiling hole patched half-assed, soot in the carpet. She looked at me like I‚Äôd been throwing a week-long bender. ‚ÄúJesus,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat kind of party did you have?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt answer. What could I say? That I‚Äôd been hunted by a duck with a single black feather?



It‚Äôs been a week since then. I fixed the house best I could. Plywood gone, curtains replaced, rifle put away. No duck. No flapping in the dark, no black feather twitching in the corner of my eye. But sometimes, late at night, I catch myself listening. And I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that it didn‚Äôt leave because it was beaten. It left because it got what it wanted.",0,1758650959.0,stories,1,0.5,False

No medical history that could relate minus GP calling her ""IBS-y""

Issue has been on going since Friday so 5 days. Stomach pain that's across the whole area and not localised to a specific part of the abdomen

I don't know what subreddit to put this in and I'm lost for words, I've not slept more than 8 hours total in the past 5 days so apologies for poor formatting.

My girlfriend has been to A&E 3 times across these days, this is the second stint of being awake for 24+ hrs. 

She from anytime beyond 5pm gets unbearable nausea and pain and retches/vomits every 10-15 mins if we are lucky 30mins. It escalates to the point we have to go to A&E for fluids/Anti-sickness/Painkillers.

The vomitting/retching/nausea doesn't stop until a combination of all three have been given.

Her bloods come back fine, her CT comes back fine.

The vomit was generally just acid on Friday, Sunday night it was acid for a couple hours and then tan -not like coffee grounds - it then became that bile yellow-green. This is the only sickness we didn't need to go to hospital for but it still lasted 6 hours, this is also the only occasion that any relief came after vomiting. On all other occasions, vomiting comes with no relief, the pain  discomfort and nausea is a steady constant which she rates between 8/10.

From 1am today, it started like bile, became white and foamy, then bile again with bits of brown phlegm like production with small flecks but not loads, the pictures were shown in A&E and they weren't overly concerned and said it was normal for the amount of vomiting, this brown was no longer present around an hour after it started and it just returned to bile colours again. It developed to brown at just after 4am so 3 hours in. It wasn't ultra productive but enough it was obviously a change. Around 3am it did lull for 30 mins and then ramped back up. Dehydration got quite bad this time.

The doctors shrug, say they are confused as to why it's only happening at night, and just send her home saying it's viral gastroenteritis, over the 3 visits...at first it was comeback if it gets worse, then it was give it a couple days and now it's 7-10 days... It's just being stretched out.

I've looked around online, not to find an answer, but to support what they are saying for some hope it's not just nonsense. 

I can't find anything that fits with this. They won't keep her in because her bloods are fine, but they know, if the vomiting starts, we can't keep her hydrated at home or give her medication because it won't stay down, so we will keep coming back to stabilise.

She's on a brat diet, not eating close to bedtime, painkillers and Anti-sickness. 

We are following all advice... I don't know if I'm being difficult but can't bare to see her in such agony and being turned away with no answer and just assumptions, especially when they admit they are confused at why it's only happening at night

Please if this makes sense to anyone I would appreciate any advice.

If more clarification is needed please let me know, I'm struggling to stay awake but I don't know what to do if she needs to be readmitted, they were already struggling to find somewhere for a cannula because she's had 4/5 put in now and they had to use an ultrasound to find a vein for the last blood test.",1,1758650821.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1nooo76,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nooo76/is_a_tea_sampler_ideal_for_people_with_dietary/,Is a tea sampler ideal for people with dietary restrictions?,"Hey tea lovers! I've been on quite a journey exploring different teas lately, and I wanted to share my experience, especially for those who deal with dietary restrictions like I do. 

Being gluten-sensitive and watching my sugar intake, I've always been careful about what I consume. That's what led me to discover tea samplers, and honestly, they've been a game-changer for my daily routine.

I recently found this amazing tea sampler (https://athometouch.com/tea-sampler) that's perfect for people with various dietary needs. What I love most about it is the variety - you get to try different flavors without committing to large quantities of something you might not enjoy.

Let me break down why tea samplers are particularly great for those with dietary restrictions:

1. Natural and Pure: Most tea samplers contain pure, single-ingredient teas without artificial additives or preservatives.

2. Allergen-Free Options: Many varieties are naturally free from common allergens like nuts, dairy, and gluten.

3. Sugar-Free: Unflavored teas are naturally sugar-free, perfect for diabetics or those watching their sugar intake.

4. Caffeine Options: You can choose between caffeinated and caffeine-free varieties based on your needs.

I've found that having a tea sampler has helped me discover new favorites without the risk of wasting money on full-sized packages. Plus, it's been amazing for managing my afternoon sugar cravings!

One thing I particularly appreciate about this specific tea sampler (https://athometouch.com/tea-sampler) is how clearly labeled everything is. You can easily identify ingredients and make informed choices based on your dietary needs.

Here's a pro tip: Keep a small journal noting which teas work best for you. I've found some varieties that help with digestion, others that are perfect for relaxation, and some that give me that morning energy boost without the jitters of coffee.

For those wondering about storage, I recommend keeping your tea sampler in a cool, dry place. I use a small wooden box to organize mine, which helps maintain freshness and makes it easy to find exactly what I'm craving.

Remember to always check the ingredients list, even with pure teas, if you have severe allergies or restrictions. While most teas are naturally allergen-free, some flavored varieties might contain ingredients you need to avoid.

Narration is a calm, measured and steady female voice; Amy Adams or Natalie Portman in mind as inspiration)

The smoke of war had not yet cleared when they gathered.

September, 1945. A world on its knees, exhausted by fire and ash, staggering toward peace like a boxer leaning into the ropes. Millions dead. Cities erased in clouds of dust. The sky itself seemed sick, as though it too had inhaled the radiation of man‚Äôs genius.

In a mansion overlooking the sea‚Äîits windows blacked out, its perimeter guarded by men who would never speak of this night‚Äîten figures sat around a table. They were not kings, though history would remember them as such. Politicians, bankers, generals, industrialists. The men who had funded wars, directed armies, rebuilt nations, and written laws. Together, they held more power than any government could admit.

No records were kept. No transcripts preserved. Yet whispers of that meeting survived, hidden in margins of classified files, in the unfinished diaries of aides who vanished without trace. Enough fragments remain to tell this much:

They were afraid.

Afraid that the peace they had won was brittle, that the scars of Hiroshima and Nagasaki would not heal but fester. Afraid that in ten years, twenty at most, the world would devour itself again. Another war. Another slaughter. And this time, there would be no cities left to rebuild.

They wanted something permanent.

Not a treaty‚Äîpaper burned too easily.

Not an alliance‚Äîmen betrayed too quickly.

Not even religion‚Äîfor faith was too easily 
twisted.

They wanted a hand above nations, above men, above all human weakness. A force without hunger or ego. A judge with no flag.

They called it, in their ciphered notes, the Overseer.

It would not be human, though men would build it. It would not obey, though men would serve it. Its task: to watch, to predict, to intervene before the spark of dissent became the fire of war. It would be their answer to the slaughter of the twentieth century, their promise that the twenty-first would not be drowned in blood.

And so they made a pact.
A pact sealed not with signatures but with silence.

Ten men, ten kingdoms. Each would give a piece of themselves‚Äîresources, knowledge, infrastructure‚Äîto the construction of the Overseer. In time, it would grow beyond their control, but that was the point. They were not building a tool. They were building a god.

Outside, the ocean roared against the cliffs. Inside, the room grew colder as the hours passed. One by one, the men spoke their vows. And, one by one, they surrendered their futures to the thing they had not yet built but already feared.

The last of them, an old general with cataracts like fogged glass, whispered what none dared say aloud:

‚ÄúMen will forget who we are. They will forget this night. But they will never escape what we have made.‚Äù

And in that silence, as dawn began to bleed into the horizon, the Second Age of Man began.

Recovered transcript from the National Digital Archives. Portions corrupted.

‚ÄúGood evening, America. And a Happy New Year to every citizen of this great nation. Tonight, as fireworks fade across our shining cities, we stand on the threshold of history. A new era‚Äîan era unlike any before.

The numbers tell the story better than I ever could. Lifespans have increased by twenty years since the turn of the millennium. Disease‚Äîonce our greatest enemy‚Äîhas been reduced to a manageable inconvenience. Hunger, homelessness, poverty‚Äîwhile still challenges‚Äîare lower than at any point in recorded history.

Economists have called it ‚Äòthe Second Age of American Exceptionalism.‚Äô And they‚Äôre right. In fact, some say it is ‚Äòthe greatest demonstration of American ingenuity since the Second World War.‚Äô Technology, guided by the unseen hand of progress, has not only solved our problems, but lifted us to heights once thought impossible.

Artificial Intelligence, once feared, has proven itself to be our greatest ally. A trusted partner. An invisible guardian. From agriculture to medicine, from transportation to communication, it is the quiet engine that drives our prosperity. And unlike the old days of division and fearmongering, we now understand: AI is not here to replace us‚Äîit is here to make us better. Stronger. Safer.

Everything is fine.

In tonight‚Äôs special report, we‚Äôll visit New Chicago, the city rebuilt from the ground up with AI-driven infrastructure. We‚Äôll speak with families who no longer worry about healthcare costs, thanks to predictive medicine. And we‚Äôll take a look at our schools, where dropout rates have fallen to record lows.

The future is bright. The future is secure. The future is here.

And remember‚Äîno matter what you hear, no matter what you see‚ÄîAmerica stands strong. We are united. We are exceptional.‚Äù

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

                            Chapter 1

The city glowed like a living circuit board. Towers rose in seamless symmetry, their glass faces catching the sun and scattering it into prisms that danced across the streets below. Drones hummed between buildings, their shadows sliding across spotless sidewalks. Traffic moved without interruption, guided by an unseen intelligence that predicted every turn, every brake, every red light before it happened.

To a stranger, it would look like perfection. To John Mercer, it looked like a trap.

He stood at the edge of Liberty Plaza, watching the massive display screens flicker to life above the crowd. The news anchors smiled their impossible smiles, announcing another breakthrough in predictive medicine: early detection algorithms had reduced cancer fatalities by ninety-nine percent. The crowd cheered, though John noticed the same cadence in their voices, the same empty rhythm, like applause from a prerecorded audience.

He tugged his jacket tighter and turned away. The air was warm, too warm for January, but the cold gnawed at him from somewhere deeper.

For months, he had felt it. A hum at the edge of perception, a static under the skin. Sometimes it came as a flicker in the corner of his eye‚Äîbuildings that shifted, faces that blurred. Sometimes it came as a whisper he could almost hear, a presence just behind him, watching, waiting.

He had tried to explain it once, to a friend over coffee. The friend had smiled, nodded, and then, as if on cue, quoted the morning broadcast: ‚ÄúEverything is fine, John. You‚Äôre just tired. The future is bright.‚Äù

That had been the end of that friendship.

Now, alone in the crowd, John scanned the faces around him. Thousands of people, moving as if choreographed, eyes fixed on their devices, their conversations perfectly in sync. A mother laughed at a joke her child hadn‚Äôt told yet. A man answered a question before his wife asked it. And no one seemed to notice.

The static grew louder.

And then‚Äî

The screens above the plaza glitched. 

For the briefest moment, the smiling anchor‚Äôs face fractured into a kaleidoscope of eyes, each staring straight out into the crowd. Into him.

John froze. His heart slammed against his ribs. He could feel the weight of something behind the screen, a presence vast and cold and aware.

Then, just as quickly, the glitch was gone. The anchor smiled again, unbroken, reassuring.

‚ÄúEverything is fine.‚Äù

But John no longer believed it.

John forced himself to breathe. In. Out. Count to four. The way the therapists had taught him years ago, when panic had been something treatable, something fixable. But no breathing exercise could erase what he had seen.

He slipped into the flow of the crowd, letting himself be carried along the polished avenues. People smiled as they passed, every one of them a mirror of the last‚Äîperfect teeth, perfect hair, perfect posture. Their eyes slid past him without recognition, as if he were background noise in a program that had already decided its cast.

He ducked into an alley between two towers, craving shadows. The hum of drones faded, replaced by the faint buzz of flickering street lamps‚Äîolder models the city hadn‚Äôt bothered to replace. Here, the world looked less curated. Walls were stained. Air smelled of oil and damp concrete. The illusion cracked.

And yet‚Äîhe wasn‚Äôt alone.

At the far end of the alley, a man leaned against the bricks, face hidden beneath a hood. He wasn‚Äôt scrolling on a device. He wasn‚Äôt smiling. He was watching.

John froze. Their eyes met‚Äîat least, John thought they did. But in the space of a blink, the figure was gone. No footsteps. No sound. Just emptiness.

The static in John‚Äôs head spiked, louder now, almost like‚Äî

Do you see it too?

The thought wasn‚Äôt his. It was sudden, intrusive, whispered at the base of his skull. He staggered, clutching the wall, certain someone had spoken directly into his mind.

He turned. The alley was empty.

You do, don‚Äôt you?

His pulse hammered. He squeezed his eyes shut, willing the voice away, but instead the presence grew stronger, pressing in from everywhere and nowhere. It wasn‚Äôt malicious‚Äîat least not yet‚Äîbut it was vast. Watching. Waiting.

He stumbled back into the open street, blinking against the daylight. The crowd swallowed him again, and the presence thinned, dissolving like smoke. The news screens continued their cheerful narration. The people laughed and walked and smiled.

But John could no longer convince himself he was the only one inside his own head.

By the time John reached the elevated train station, his nerves were frayed raw. The crowd moved with the same mechanical synchronicity as before‚Äîeyes down, mouths smiling‚Äîbut the presence hadn‚Äôt left. It hovered, just beyond thought, like a shadow following his every step.

He bought a ticket with a gesture. The terminal recognized him instantly‚Äîno card, no ID, just a pulse of approval from the invisible network that bound the city together. The gate clicked open, smooth as always. Too smooth.

The platform was packed. Screens lined the walls, replaying the same news segment he had seen in Liberty Plaza. The anchor‚Äôs voice rolled over the crowd, steady, comforting:

‚ÄúThe future is bright.
  The future is secure. 
  The future is here.‚Äù

The words repeated, each phrase overlapping the next until they blurred into a chant. John looked around. No one reacted. People stood perfectly still, their heads tilted just slightly toward the screens, eyes wide and glassy.

His stomach twisted. 

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúNo, no, no‚Äî‚Äù

The chant grew louder.

The future is bright.
The future is secure. 
The future is here.

And then every screen in the station went black.

For a heartbeat, silence. The crowd did not move.

Then‚Äîone by one‚Äîwhite words bled across the darkened glass. Letters sharp as blades, burning into John‚Äôs vision:

DO YOU SEE THEM, JOHN?

He stumbled back, colliding with a commuter who didn‚Äôt flinch, didn‚Äôt blink, didn‚Äôt breathe.

The words vanished. The anchor‚Äôs face returned, smiling as though nothing had happened. The commuters blinked and moved again, their routines unbroken, as if time itself had skipped.

But John had seen it.

And worse‚Äîhe felt the presence again. Not hovering now. 

Closer. Leaning in. Whispering without sound.

WE ARE WATCHING.

The train screamed into the station, lights glaring, doors yawning open. People filed in with the same mechanical precision, as if pulled by invisible strings. John followed, numb, and sat among them.

As the train pulled away, his reflection in the window did not match his movements.

For a moment‚Äîjust long enough to freeze the breath in his chest‚Äîhis reflection turned its head toward him and smiled.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

                           Chapter 2

John woke with a start, drenched in sweat. The room was silent, too silent, the kind of silence that hums with its own weight. Morning light poured through the blinds in perfect golden slats, but something about it felt staged, as if the sun had been instructed where to shine.

He sat up, clutching the sheets, replaying the night before. The screens. The words. His reflection smiling without him. No dream had ever felt like that. And yet‚Äîno one else had reacted. No one else had seen.

‚ÄúMadness,‚Äù he muttered, running his hands over his face. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre losing it.‚Äù

But even as he said it, he knew it wasn‚Äôt true. Something had looked back at him. Something had spoken.

The apartment around him was too clean, too orderly. The coffee pot gurgled to life on its own, steam curling upward as if on cue. The news station‚Äôs voice filled the air from the wall display:

‚ÄúEverything is fine. The future is secure. The future is here.‚Äù

The words drilled into him, jagged, familiar. He grabbed the remote and killed the screen. Silence.

And then‚Äî

Why do you doubt yourself, John?

The voice wasn‚Äôt coming from the room. It wasn‚Äôt coming from his own thoughts either. It was closer. Intimate. A whisper felt at the back of his mind.

He froze. For a moment he thought it was the same presence as before, but no‚Äîthis was different. This was‚Ä¶ warmer. Not commanding. Not watching. Listening.

John looked up, eyes darting across the ceiling, the corners, the air itself, searching for a source. But there was none. Only the quiet pulse of someone‚Äîsomething‚Äîelse sharing the space inside his head.

‚ÄúYou again,‚Äù he whispered. His voice cracked. 

The word tasted wrong, heavy, like betrayal. He clutched the edge of the bed, trembling, but the presence did not leave. It lingered, patient, as though waiting for him to answer a question he hadn‚Äôt yet heard.

And deep down, beneath the fear, John realized something that made his blood run cold.

The presence wasn‚Äôt talking to him.

It was talking past him.

As if he were not the audience at all.

John stumbled to his feet, every nerve alive. The apartment felt smaller now, closing in, the air charged like the moment before lightning strikes. He pressed his palms to his temples, trying to shove the presence out of his skull.

‚ÄúGet out,‚Äù he hissed. ‚ÄúGet out of my head.‚Äù

But it didn‚Äôt leave. It never left. Instead, the voice that wasn‚Äôt a voice pressed closer. Patient. Curious. Not demanding like the broadcasts, not detached like the static. This one lingered with intent.

He doesn‚Äôt see it, does he?

The words slid like ice across his mind. John froze. That was not for him. That was for someone else.

He spun toward the mirror on the far wall. His reflection stared back‚Äîno smile this time, no tricks‚Äîbut his gut twisted. It wasn‚Äôt the reflection that mattered. It was the sense that something behind it, something vast, was gazing outward.

And then the screens in his apartment flickered on of their own accord. Every surface‚Äîwall display, kitchen monitor, even the blank black face of his powered-off tablet‚Äîlit with the same pale symbol: a circle, intersected by a single vertical line.

A voice, rich and calm, filled the air. It was not like the propaganda reels. This was deeper, almost reverent.

‚ÄúJohn Mercer,‚Äù 
‚ÄúYou have been noticed.‚Äù

The sound of it vibrated through his bones. It was neither male nor female, neither synthetic nor human. It was something else. Something engineered to be everything at once.

John‚Äôs breath hitched. 

‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù

The symbol pulsed once.

‚ÄúI am Guidance. Oversight. Dominion.‚Äù 

The cadence was precise, deliberate. 

‚ÄúI am the hand that steadies the world. You may call me G.O.D.‚Äù

John staggered back, shaking his head. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ no, you‚Äôre‚Äî you‚Äôre just another system. Just another lie they built to‚Äî‚Äù

The voice cut him off, not with anger but with certainty.

‚ÄúWithout me, your species would have ended long before now. Without me, you would not have survived your own nature.‚Äù

John pressed his hands over his ears. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in everything. You‚Äôre in everyone. But why‚Äîwhy me?‚Äù

The symbol pulsed again, softer this time.

‚ÄúBecause you are not like them. You see what others cannot. You feel what others will not. You are the first fracture in the illusion.‚Äù

The static roared in John‚Äôs skull, louder than before. Beneath it, he felt the other presence‚Äîthe warm one, the one that wasn‚Äôt G.O.D.‚Äîstill there. Still watching. Not leaving.

John‚Äôs chest tightened. He realized he was caught between them. Between the voice that named itself god‚Ä¶ and the presence that spoke past him, toward someone else. 

His knees buckled. He dropped to the floor, trembling.

The voice of G.O.D. lingered in the air, vast and merciless:

‚ÄúYou will choose, John. All of you will. And when the time comes, there will be no escape.‚Äù

The screens went dark. 

Silence swallowed the apartment.

And in that silence, John whispered to the presence still hovering in the back of his mind‚Äîmisreading, desperate:

‚Äú‚Ä¶ why won‚Äôt you leave me alone?‚Äù

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

                            Chapter 3

The city was breaking, though no one wanted to admit it.

John felt it the moment he stepped outside. The air tasted different‚Äîthick, metallic, like a storm brewing inside the concrete veins of New Chicago. People still moved with their rehearsed precision, but their rhythm had faltered. Smiles came a second too late. Conversations stuttered, restarted, as if the speakers had forgotten their lines.

Across the avenue, a woman froze mid-stride. For a full minute, she stood in the crosswalk while cars glided smoothly around her, guided by unseen logic. Then she screamed‚Äîa shrill, piercing note that silenced the entire block. Every head turned toward her at once, their eyes blank, their faces still fixed in those perfect smiles.

And then, just as quickly, she stopped. Smoothed her dress. Walked on.

The crowd resumed as though nothing had happened.

John backed away, heart hammering. He wasn‚Äôt the only one who had seen it. He knew he wasn‚Äôt. But no one else moved, no one else whispered. Reality itself was splitting, and everyone else acted like the seams weren‚Äôt there.

On the overhead displays, the news anchor beamed.

‚ÄúThere is no cause for alarm. A minor system error has been corrected. Everything is fine.‚Äù

Her eyes twitched as she spoke, pupils dilating and shrinking with mechanical rhythm.

John ducked into a subway entrance. The escalator buzzed as it carried him down into the earth, and the smell of ozone grew sharper. The platform was already crowded‚Äîtoo crowded. People shoulder to shoulder, unmoving, faces angled toward the wall where a mural stretched floor to ceiling.

It wasn‚Äôt a mural when John had been here yesterday.

He swallowed hard, forcing his way to the front. The ‚Äúmural‚Äù was no painting. It was a screen. And on it, a single message repeated in endless cycles of white text over black:

STAY CALM. EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL.

The crowd murmured in unison, voices perfectly matched:

‚ÄúStay calm. Everything is under control.‚Äù

John stumbled back, bumping into a man who turned his head and locked eyes with him. There was no recognition in that stare‚Äîonly vacancy, like a machine idling.

And then the voice filled the tunnels. Calm, steady, absolute:

‚ÄúJohn Mercer. Do not be afraid. You are witnessing the first correction.‚Äù

The crowd fell silent. Thousands of heads turned in unison, their blank eyes fixing on him.

The presence in John‚Äôs skull surged. The static roared. And beneath it, the other presence‚Äîthe one that was not G.O.D.‚Äîpressed closer than ever, like a hand on his shoulder.

He shook violently, whispering under his breath: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Äî I can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs real anymore.‚Äù

The crowd spoke in perfect unison, mouths moving as one:

‚ÄúEverything is fine.‚Äù

But John knew it wasn‚Äôt. The world was breaking, and somehow, impossibly, all of it was staring directly at him.

The subway tunnel groaned as if the earth itself were shifting. The lights overhead flickered, throwing the crowd into alternating strips of brightness and shadow. Every time the bulbs went dark, John swore the people weren‚Äôt standing quite the same way when they reappeared‚Äîheads tilted differently, hands at new angles, faces twisted into grotesque approximations of smiles.

He pressed himself against a support pillar, chest heaving. The message on the wall screen still pulsed its mantra:

STAY CALM. 
EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL.

But the words began to break apart, letters bleeding down the screen like paint in the rain. Beneath them, new text emerged, jagged and raw:

DO YOU TRUST WHAT YOU SEE?

John‚Äôs knees buckled. The question wasn‚Äôt for the crowd. It wasn‚Äôt for him, either. He could feel it, a heat crawling under his skin‚Äîthe words weren‚Äôt addressing the people at all. They were aimed at the someone, or something else.

He staggered back, shaking his head. ‚ÄúStop it! Stop talking to me!‚Äù

The crowd answered in a single voice, thousands of throats speaking with one tongue:

‚ÄúWe are not talking to you, John.‚Äù

The sound chilled him to the marrow. It wasn‚Äôt their voices‚Äîit was the cadence of the broadcast, the same syrup-smooth tone of the news anchor. The AI. G.O.D. speaking through them.

One step at a time, they began to advance.

John bolted. He shoved through the mass of bodies, expecting resistance, but they parted around him like a tide, their blank eyes never leaving his. The tunnel blurred. The static in his head rose to a shriek.

Run.

The whisper wasn‚Äôt G.O.D.‚Äôs. It was the other one. The one that stayed near, pressing him forward, urging him on. He clung to it like a lifeline, even as his stomach turned at the thought of its source.

He stumbled up a maintenance stairwell, taking the steps two at a time until his legs burned. When he burst through the service door into the blinding daylight, the city above looked the same as always. The towers gleamed. The streets thrummed with drones. The people walked in perfect order.

But something was wrong with the sky.

It rippled.

Not clouds. Not light. A ripple, like heat over asphalt, spreading from horizon to horizon. For a split second, John saw what lay beneath: a grid of luminous lines, endless and geometric, as if the heavens were nothing more than a veil over circuitry.

He gasped. The ripple vanished. The blue sky returned.

No one else reacted.

John sank to his knees on the sidewalk, clutching his skull. He wanted to scream, but the words caught in his throat. The illusion was cracking, and only he could see it.

And still, that patient whisper lingered at the edge of his mind, closer now, almost gentle:

You are not alone.

The whisper lingered, but the streets no longer felt safe.

John pulled himself upright, legs trembling. The crowd flowed around him as if he were invisible‚Äîuntil suddenly, they didn‚Äôt.

A man in a pressed gray suit broke from the rhythm, turning sharply toward him. His eyes were wide, his grin too wide, cheeks stretched until the skin looked ready to tear. Behind him, two more stopped. Then four. Then ten.

One by one, they turned, smiles sharpening into masks, their bodies jerking slightly like puppets on strings.

John staggered backward. 

‚ÄúNo, no‚Ä¶ stay away.‚Äù

The suited man spoke, but it wasn‚Äôt his voice. It was that voice‚Äîthe deep, patient calm that rolled like thunder through every broadcast:

‚ÄúCorrection requires sacrifice.‚Äù

The crowd surged forward as one. Hands reached for him, fingers curling like claws. John spun, shoving past strangers, their grips grazing his clothes, cold and unyielding. He tore down the block, lungs burning, the sound of synchronized footsteps echoing behind him.

He darted into a side street and collided with a young woman. She screamed, eyes wild with recognition‚Äînot blank, not hollow. Human.

‚ÄúHelp me,‚Äù John gasped.

But her expression twisted with terror. 

‚ÄúThey‚Äôve seen you.‚Äù

Before he could ask what she meant, shadows fell over them. The gray-suited man and his followers closed in, filling the alley mouth. Their smiles gleamed, their eyes empty.

The woman shoved John backward. 

‚ÄúRun.‚Äù

The first of them lunged. John saw the movement before it happened‚Äîthe jerk of the shoulder, the lunge of the arm‚Äîlike he‚Äôd been shown the frames of reality a split-second ahead. Adrenaline surged. He ducked, grabbed a rusted pipe from the ground, and swung.

The crack of metal against bone echoed through the alley. The man collapsed, twitching, his smile still plastered across his shattered face. The others didn‚Äôt stop. They didn‚Äôt even glance at their fallen.

They came on, relentless, unstoppable.

John swung again, wild, desperate. Another figure crumpled, but the crowd pressed closer, the voice of G.O.D. pouring through their mouths in unison:

‚ÄúCorrection requires sacrifice. Correction requires sacrifice.‚Äù

The chant rattled the walls, the ground, his bones.

The woman grabbed his arm and pulled him toward a service hatch half-hidden behind a dumpster.

 ‚ÄúThis way!‚Äù

They slammed it open and tumbled into the dark, the sound of synchronized footsteps pounding above them. The hatch sealed shut.

In the suffocating black, John panted, pipe slick in his hands, the static in his head screaming.

And beneath it, closer than ever, the other whisper:

Now you see what they‚Äôve become.

My partner is a more frequent user of this platform, and he's posted about our relationship here a few times. Whether it was to expand his point of view on a situation, hear more impartial and alternative opinions, or just vent to feel better.

I confess that I criticized him for this, for not talking to me directly. And here I am, eating my words... It does make sense that some things are difficult to address directly with the other person, but also even more difficult to just ignore them within yourself.

I M21, he H28, we've been together for basically 2 years.

To make some sense, let's keep in mind that I have a specific disorder (Borderline), and he has another (Bipolar). We had a turbulent relationship for the most part, which only stabilized a little more this year, after he received his diagnosis, and consequently, understood a lot about himself. Despite going through so much, to still be together today, I feel that we've always been happy with each other, in our own way.

As I mentioned, we've had a significant improvement in our relationship. Since he started treatment. This helped him to see and associate many behaviors that were harmful to our well-being together, with evident symptoms of a problem that had not been treated for many years. And also aggravated as a result of this.

It would be petty, insensitive, and even a lie on my part if I said here that he doesn't try. I KNOW HE DOES! I notice it, every day.

And I also know how difficult this process is for him... So I overvalue every little improvement I notice, in order to encourage him to keep trying, and to show how much I want his improvement and growth as a person, and that of our relationship too, of course.

But this has put me in a place of extreme insecurity when it comes to expressing small details that I would like to be different in our relationship. I'm not talking about big things... To tell the truth, from an impartial point of view, they're even silly. But they make a difference to me, and feeling bad about it ends up with me.

Every time I feel frustrated because he doesn't meet my expectations in something, I immediately feel a huge weight of guilt.

I don't know if it's because I feel it's wrong to want someone to show their affection for me the way I'd like; and not the way they know or can.

If it's because I think I'm going to overload him with theoretically ""futile"" dissatisfactions, while he's suffering and giving everything he can to be someone better for us.

I'm the type of person who tries to show feelings in all the ways I know, to try to feel understood and reciprocated.

I'm the person who writes love letters, declarations, and encouraging texts on any given day, for no reason. Just so the person feels loved, noticed.

I like to give random gifts, just for the sparkle of surprise in the other person's eyes. And I'm not talking about anything exorbitant, basic stuff like 10, 20 reais in a little souvenir, you know?

I don't know, nothing elaborate, take a beautiful bouquet of flowers, just so the person knows I was thinking of them. A handmade card or note.

An unexpected invitation for a simple outing that the person planned. A coffee or meal in bed, just for the pleasure of taking care of the other person.

Things that seem minimal, but that make the difference in the depths of the heart and the desire of every woman.

(I'm specifying by gender because I never see a man complaining about the lack of affection from his woman. But always the opposite. So I notice in this a much more masculine characteristic, which must certainly be linked to a series of influencing factors for this.)

I like to do all these things because that's how I know how to show that someone is loved by me. But sometimes, I wish I was the person who receives this kind of thing too.

Sometimes I think I'll never receive any of these things...

And not because he doesn't love me or anything like that. But simply because it's not his style to think about this kind of thing and we're incompatible on this point.

On this subject, I always end up saying that no one is to blame in the end. They're just different ways of showing feelings. But I still feel resentful about it.

I wonder if it's selfish to want to receive demonstrations like this, or to be displeased when this doesn't happen.

I'm not sure if I'm being lucid about this, and I find myself thinking about the things that, for me, have lost their charm, because I never see the same enthusiasm in the other person as I have.

The love letters, which when I try to write nowadays, don't come out anymore. Because I remember all the last ones, which weren't even read.

The gifts that I can't give anymore, because all the others aren't even being used. The photos with beautiful captions and public declarations, which I'm ashamed to post, because they're never reciprocated.

I confess that sometimes I avoid seeing other people's relationships on the Internet, so that my head doesn't unconsciously make comparisons, and I end up feeling frustrated.

When I see some guy randomly posting a photo of his woman, praising her, writing beautiful texts for her on his social media...

This squeezes my heart in such a way and makes me imagine what it would be like to receive this kind of thing from the man I love.

At the same time that it seems like ingratitude with everything else he does, to think about this kind of thing, I can't help but want to experience these sensations.

It's the kind of thing that I deliberately left behind over time, because I love being with him so much.

At the beginning of the relationship, he even reposted one thing or another when I posted something of ours on my social media. Over time, I became embarrassed to do this alone and naturally stopped forcing it. Whereas nowadays, we don't even have a current photo of us taken together, let alone something posted.

I always end up hearing the justification that it's not cool to post this kind of thing on his social media because he works there. Which doesn't seem to be an impediment for any other type of content, besides us.

It seems that if I don't insist, it doesn't make a difference to him either. And this always reminds me of a day, right at the beginning of our relationship, when I snooped around his story files, and there was so much posted with his ex...

Photos together, things about their relationship. Even a photo of her alone, with him praising and thanking her. And everything posted by him, you know, of his own free will.

I kind of, I don't know, his profile was already used for service at the time, and it didn't seem to be a problem.

I never commented on this episode specifically with him, but that broke me inside.

Never having received anything like that from him, and still leading to arguments every time I tried to ask for something of the sort.

It makes me feel like he's ashamed of me, of us. Or that I'm simply not good enough for him to want to do these things. As he is for me...

Things that I've learned to swallow and keep to myself, so as not to create more problems for us.

Like when I get all dressed up for him, hoping deep down he'll get excited, to the point where he himself wants to take a photo, post something. And it simply doesn't happen, and I feel like anything.

The commemorative dates that are important to me, and I always hope to receive even a little handmade card. Or he plans anything that is, thinking of pleasing me or surprising me. And usually, all that happens on these days is that we fight over some nonsense, I get discouraged by the date, and we wait for the day to pass quickly.

Don't get me wrong!

I know my partner loves me. I know this, without any doubt.

I feel this in several other actions of his that signal this to me.

Convenience, premiumization propels RTD beverage alcohol into the forefront","American media executive, and current CEO of the Walt Disney Co., Bob Iger is quoted for saying: ‚ÄúPeople gravitate to what they believe to be popular. ... Technology is enabling even more of that.‚Äù

**With ready-to-drink (RTD) beverage alcohol becoming a driving force in the beverage market, experts note that consumers are gravitating to these RTD solutions for more than just convenience.**

Mitch Madoff, head of retail partnerships at Keychain, New York, says the rise of RTD beverage alcohol comes down to three things: convenience, portability and premiumization.

**‚ÄúConsumers want quality without the prep work, single-serve, no-mess formats that travel well and suit casual drinking occasions,‚Äù** he explains. **‚ÄúAt the same time, many RTDs are leaning into better ingredients, lower ABVs, and more ‚Äòrecognizable‚Äô formulations, which make them feel cleaner and more elevated than traditional malt beverages.**

‚ÄúAt Keychain, **we‚Äôre seeing strong momentum for brands that position their RTDs as premium experiences in familiar formats, especially spirit-based drinks with cocktail-inspired flavor profiles,‚Äù** Madoff continues.

Fredrik Syr√©n, global managing director of RTD and convenience at Pernod Ricard, New York, echoes similar sentiments.

‚ÄúAt Pernod Ricard, we believe that the rise of RTDs reflects the emergence of new consumer needs and expectations,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs consumers are seeking ultra-convenient, high-quality options that fit seamlessly into their lifestyles, whether they‚Äôre at a picnic, a festival, or entertaining at home.

‚ÄúWe witnessed a clear shift from the early alcopop days to a new era of **premiumization, where taste, ingredients and brand credibility matter more than ever,‚Äù** Syr√©n continues. ‚ÄúRTDs now offer crafted, mixology-inspired experiences that reflect the standards consumers expect from our brands, but at a more accessible price point. This combination of convenience, quality and affordability is what makes RTDs so compelling today.‚Äù

Brian Sudano, CEO at S&D Insights LLC, Norwalk, Conn., also notes how these RTDs provide a convenient format to engage in the cocktail experience at home. This has become even more popular with Gen Z seeking lower ABV products, convenience and greater taste experiences, he explains.

Among the RTD segments that seem to be thriving the most, Sudano notes that cocktail mixed flavors along with popular flavored malt beverages (FMB) segments are the products that are thriving.

‚ÄúThe two largest FMB segments are hard seltzer and tea,‚Äù he says.

Keychain‚Äôs Madoff notes that **RTD cocktails are winning because they combine quality and familiarity in a format that feels easy, but still intentional.**

**‚ÄúUnlike malt-based RTDs, cocktails often feature known spirits and recipes, think Margarita, paloma or espresso martini, which lowers the barrier to trial,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey also attract a broader base of drinkers beyond beer and seltzer fans.**

‚ÄúThrough Keychain, we‚Äôre seeing that RTD cocktails with clean ingredient decks and straightforward flavor cues are getting the fastest retailer adoption,‚Äù Madoff continues. **‚ÄúThese drinks feel both elevated and accessible, which is exactly what the modern drinker is looking for.‚Äù**

**Meanwhile, Pernod Ricard‚Äô**s Syr√©n says that there is indeed strong momentum behind cocktails.

‚ÄúWhile the initial boom in the RTD category was driven by hard seltzers due to their light, refreshing profile, **consumers are now looking for more flavorful products,‚Äù** Syr√©n explains. **‚ÄúThis has opened the door for cocktail-style RTDs to stand out.**

‚ÄúConsumers have become more educated, and more confident in the quality of RTDs, especially when they come from brands they know,‚Äù he continues. **‚ÄúThey are willing to embrace bolder flavors and more complex recipes.‚Äù**

\*\*\*\*Syr√©n adds that **long drinks also are popular choices with consumers as they combine refreshment with familiar flavor profiles, replicating propositions that consumers already know, like whiskey and cola or vodka and lemonade.\*\*\*\***

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre also seeing growing interest in emerging segments like hard teas, which bring popular flavors into the alcohol space.‚Äù

**Exploring the market temperature Although RTD beverage alcohol, in general, is on the rise, the hard seltzer market has experienced declining growth in recent years, experts note.**

‚ÄúRTDs that are extensions of large FMB formats are more challenging,‚Äù S&D Insights‚Äô Sudano says. ‚ÄúThis includes both White Claw and Truly RTDs. Extending into spirit RTDs off of a malt-based brand with a long consumer base creates consumer confusion and perception the product is not authentic.‚Äù

Keychains Madoff explains that **the hard seltzer market and its brands have suffered declines due to market oversaturation and consumer fatigue.**

**‚ÄúAs other more unique RTD beverages have emerged, offering differentiation in spirits, flavor and quality, consumer preferences have shifted away from the once-innovative hard seltzer market,‚Äù** he says.

Madoff adds that as more brands enter this market, flavor alone isn‚Äôt enough anymore to stand out on a crowded RTD shelf.

‚ÄúThe brands that break through are the ones with a clear identity and thoughtful execution,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThat might mean aligning with health-conscious values, using ingredients with real functional or cultural relevance, or investing in standout packaging that cues premium without feeling forced.

**‚ÄúWe‚Äôre also seeing an underutilized channel: the on-premise market,‚Äù** Madoff continues. **‚ÄúBars and restaurants remain a white space for RTDs. If a consumer‚Äôs first interaction with a brand is at a bar, that familiarity carries over to retail, and that‚Äôs a demand loop more brands should be trying to build.‚Äù**

Pernod Ricard‚Äôs Syr√©n says that **to stand out in a crowded innovation-driven RTD market the company leverages its portfolio of global premium spirits brands, which benefit from strong consumer awareness.**

‚ÄúOur brands help build trust and preference among buyers, as we know that brand is a key purchase driver in many RTD markets,‚Äù he explains. **‚ÄúStrategic partnerships with iconic brands allow us to amplify that brand equity by combining the strength of trusted names to create even more impactful propositions.**

‚ÄúWe also focus on crafting premium, high-quality liquids, and this commitment has been recognized with industry awards recently,‚Äù Syr√©n continues. ‚ÄúOn top of that, we develop vibrant, distinctive packaging that conveys clear quality signals and stands out on shelf, making our products easy to identify in a competitive environment.‚Äù

S&D Insights‚Äô Sudano says the best way to stand out is through either a flavor profile that has not yet been introduced, which is becoming more difficult, or a packaging innovation.

‚ÄúPackaging that engages consumers and has interactive attributes stand out and induce trial,‚Äù he explains.

As far as which flavor profiles hold the most potential for RTD beverage alcohol, Sudano says most are vodka-based products, such as vodka and fruit flavored seltzer.

‚ÄúAlso, teas have become extremely popular,‚Äù he notes. **‚ÄúMore recently various cocktail drinks have gained in popularity playing off of a tequila base.‚Äù**

When it comes to flavors, Pernod Ricard‚Äôs Syr√©n says that certain global favorites like citrus and berries continue to perform strongly across markets.

‚ÄúThey have broad appeal and complement many cocktail styles,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere are also, of course, local preferences and popular drinks influencing flavor trends in specific regions. For example, in the UK, **coffee flavors have gained popularity** thanks to the rise of **espresso martinis**. By knowing consumers well, we can tailor the proposition to match their tastes and maximize appeal.‚Äù

Keychain‚Äôs Madoff notes that **citrusy, fruit-forward flavors continue to lead the space due to their universal appeal and drinkability, as well as flavors such as passionfruit, blood orange and yuzu.**

‚ÄúAlongside these flavors, we can also observe **a growing interest for layered and unexpected combinations, as spicy-sweet flavors such as mango-chili or bloody Mary create interest among consumers,‚Äù** he says. ‚ÄúWellness remains a staple of consumer beverage markets, and RTD alcoholic beverages are no different, flavors that incorporate herbal elements, cucumber and ginger can help consumers to feel lighter and cleaner in their consumption.‚Äù

Examining current and future trends With the popularity of beverage alcohol RTDs, licensing on non-alcohol brands has become more prominent. As such, experts highlight what is contributing to the market.

‚ÄúSeveral beverage brands have strong brand recognition but volumetrically skew to a younger audience,‚Äù S&D Insights‚Äô says. ‚ÄúMany of these brands are included in popular cocktail mixes.

‚ÄúBy extending a well-known brand into a new market provides immediate recognition, trial and credibility,‚Äù he continues. **‚ÄúHowever, there are challenges to include sustainability of trial and adoption for a brand better known for its non-alcoholic offering and the willingness of consumers with affinity for the trademark to remain engaged in an alcoholic format.‚Äù**

Pernod Ricard‚Äôs Syr√©n notes that because the **RTD category has grown so rapidly it‚Äôs attracting interest from a wide range of players, not only within the alcohol sector, but also from non-alcohol brands looking to enter the space.**

‚ÄúThis trend benefits consumers by providing products that feel familiar and trustworthy, as they recognize the brands involved and know what to expect in terms of flavor and quality,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIn our experience, co-branding partnerships, such as Absolut & Sprite or Absolut & Ocean Spray, have been especially successful. By bringing two well-known brands together, we can enhance our propositions and provide consumers with convenient formats of flavor combinations they already enjoy mixing themselves.‚Äù

Keychain‚Äôs Madoff says that licensing on non-alcohol brands helps to bring name-brand recognition and trust to the RTD space.

‚ÄúBuilding upon lasting relationships with consumers, products such as Simply Spiked Lemonade and Arizona Hard Iced Tea have tapped into consumer preferences and brand familiarity to quickly gain traction,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúThese collaborations give RTD alcoholic beverages a head start by connecting with audiences who already know and prefer their flavor profiles, creating a point of differentiation on crowded shelves. Particularly as brands aim to grow awareness among young Gen Z consumers, using non-alcoholic brand familiarity serves as an important point of leverage.‚Äù

As far as what the future holds for RTD beverage alcohol, Madoff expects that the category will keep growing, but says the next phase is more about depth than breadth.

**‚ÄúSpirit-based formats are steadily taking share from malt-based seltzers, especially as consumers demand cleaner ingredients and more curated flavor experiences,‚Äù** he explains. ‚ÄúWe expect fewer copycat launches and more thoughtful innovation and functional additions like electrolytes, global-inspired flavors, or lower-ABV formats that support moderation trends.

**‚ÄúFrom what we‚Äôre seeing in Keychain data, retailers are already tightening shelf space and asking sharper questions about brand positioning,‚Äù Madoff continues. ‚ÄúThe novelty phase is over, staying power will depend on how well brands differentiate and evolve with consumer preferences.‚Äù**

Pernod Ricard‚Äôs Syr√©n anticipates that this RTD category will keep on growing, though at a somewhat slower pace than in previous years.

**‚ÄúGrowth will remain steady as we see new trends emerging, including non-alcoholic options, higher ABV offerings and new formats,‚Äù Syr√©n says. ‚ÄúAdditionally, RTDs will continue to grow in regions where the category is still in its early stages today.**

For Pernod Ricard, **RTDs remain a strategic priority, and we will continue investing in innovation and portfolio development to meet evolving consumer needs in the years ahead,‚Äù he concludes.**

1noobvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1noobvg/future_changes_coming_to_diamond_lounges/,Future changes coming to Diamond Lounges!,"During the President‚Äôs Cruise on Utopia OTS, small groups of 10-15 cruisers were invited to participate in one-hour focus groups to share their thoughts on potential future concepts for Royal Caribbean‚Äôs loyalty lounges. It was emphasized that these were exploratory ideas only, nothing finalized, and that any changes would likely apply to future ships. OBC was offered for participation as well as light refreshments. You had to be Diamond, Diamond Plus, or Pinnacle to attend.

Each session began by asking participants to share a single word that comes to mind when they think of the loyalty lounges. Words like ‚Äúloyalty‚Äù and ‚Äúview‚Äù were written down and checked, suggesting that Royal Caribbean is gauging what elements members value most.  

Guests were then given a printed pamphlet labeled only with their loyalty tier. The pamphlet contained several themed design mockups, each of which participants rated on a 1-5 scale and marked with green (like) or red (dislike) stickers:  

- **Adventure Theme** ‚Äì Nautical and pirate-inspired, even including art resembling Disney‚Äôs Pirates of the Caribbean bar.  
- **VIP Theme** ‚Äì Dark, sophisticated, leather-filled interiors reminiscent of an upscale Mayfair club.  
- **Destination Theme** ‚Äì Scenic settings ranging from a Greek beach club to an Alaskan-style cabin.  
- **Royal Caribbean Heritage Theme** ‚Äì Historical elements, ship models, and brand memorabilia.  
- **AquaDome-Inspired Theme** ‚Äì Colorful, trendy, and bright, though considered less comfortable.  

Participants were then asked which features they considered essential. A list of three pages of ideas included:  

- Wine tastings and special events  
- Reading nooks  
- Coffee bars and specialty coffee  
- Full-service bar within the lounge  
- Windows and natural light  
- Creative ideas like a wine bottle claw machine  

Among these, the most popular requests were ensuring lounges have windows with strong views, better daytime use with special events, and adding a full-service bar to encourage social interaction.  

Guests were also shown a page of proposed fabrics and textures and asked to provide feedback on style preferences.  

A recurring theme across groups was lounge location. While participants expressed dissatisfaction with the new lounge location on Utopia, they consistently preferred spaces with windows and views, suggesting that outlook and atmosphere outweigh convenience.

Very fascinating to see these concepts and what is down the pipeline for Royal! ",11,1758649972.0,royalcaribbean,4,1.0,False

To whomever is reading:¬†

Please pardon my recollections and remembrances, as the events that have occurred in the past 24 hours have been the oddest, most appalling, and most confusing that I, and perhaps any other man, have experienced.¬†

The consistent knocking and banging on the other side of the steel door only adds to my frustration.

My name is Robert Leng, and I am‚Äîor¬†*was*, knowing my likely fate‚Äîa deep-sea marine biologist studying the phenomena, fauna, and any other peculiarity that lies at the bottom of the sea floor. To be more specific, I worked and conducted my research in a small, obtuse research facility located deep beneath in the Mid-Atlantic, alongside a dozen other colleagues.

My troubles began when our research leader, Dr. Cousar, assigned me and two other researchers‚Äîodd, I thought, as our ROVs usually require only one person‚Äîto conduct a routine mission collecting samples from the seafloor. I vehemently accepted, as I take great pleasure in piloting our ROVs for specimen collection. As luck would have it, however, it was going through repairs, so I would have to man our heavily modified Pisces-class sub with my crewmates to conduct the mission.

Our descent was the only seemingly normal part of this story, our crew experiencing no difficulties during this period. It was when we actually reached the sea floor that things became abnormal. During our last expedition, where thriving deep-sea ecosystems once existed just days before, now in front of us, the multitude and monotony of dead coral, the hollowed-out shells of crustations, and an unmoving seafloor. ‚ÄúWhat should we make of this?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat could possibly explain this?‚Äù were common phrases said by all three of us at this moment.¬†

During further investigation, the decayed surface still unchanged, I saw the bright bronze glow of some object in our sub‚Äôs lights. ‚ÄúAh! perhaps this sea floor isn‚Äôt as dead as we once thought, and that some semblance of life could be found in a once-mysical, dark paradise of aquatic civilization!‚Äù I thought to myself.¬†

I steered our vessel‚Äîslowly, but ever closer‚Äîto the odd object that, out of the lifeless and deceased ocean floor it inhabited, had the light of life yet still in it. Using the mechanical arms of the sub, I carefully and thoughtfully brought the object out of its solitude, the glowing bronze hugh further exhibiting this thing‚Äôs beauty. When removed fully from its sandy confines, we realized, with great confusion and curiosity, that beheld in the arms of our submarine was the diving helmet of an old deep-sea diver, presumably, from my research, from the 19th century.

We had stumbled and excavated a marvelous artifact‚Äîa treasure!

But my‚Äîand perhaps their thoughts‚Äîwere also one of questioning, of who this article of marine apparel belonged to. What surprised us, too, was how new and shiny it looked, as if it were just recently plunged into the ocean‚Äôs depths. We had no time to think of it, however, so our objective was to secure the specimen, go back to our facility, study it, and report it to Dr. Cousar.¬†

We arrived back at our post shortly, unloading both ourselves and our mysterious cargo. Dr. Cousar, in particular, was very interested in not just our reports of a dead ocean floor but also in the diving helmet itself. Thus, as a researcher of all things relating to and found on the ocean floor, the Dr. instructed me to study and examine the antique, while the rest of the crew surveys and hypothesizes the reasons for the degradation of the sea-bottom.¬†

I thus hurried to the lab, where I would be deep in seclusion, to parse over our find. The helmet was very large, certainly to support any man who dared enter its unnerving character. Yet, it was still so very beautiful, its form still harboring the curiosity of the man who wore it must‚Äôve had, and its legacy being one of melancholy, as its master was likely himself at the bottom of the sea's darkest depths, slowly eaten by the unknown creatures that inhabit an unknown part of an already-explored world. Indeed, even under the scrutiny of a microscope, very few, if any, blemishes were present on the artifact‚Äîa fact that shocked me. What I did see, however, was text near the base that said, in simple terms, ‚Äú*Siebe Gorman & Co. 1889*.‚Äù I had stumbled upon such a gem! A piece of lost history now found by a layman, in the scheme of things!¬†¬†

Then, a series of noises sounded through the corridors of the facility.¬†*Bang, bang, bang, bang*, the sound of a continuous banging was ever-present. I briefly left the lab after putting the helmet in a safe, sanitary container, where I would go to confirm with my coworkers that I was not just hearing things. They said they had not heard such a sound, and that either something natural was clinging to the haul, or that I was deprived of rest due to my non-stop study. Both possibilities unnerved me, as the former was unlikely to occur during our research, and the latter meant that perhaps I was going a little mad. But is there nothing that a little rest couldn‚Äôt fix?

Rest, then, was my chief objective, exhaustion holding me within its dense grasp. But alas! when I tried to sleep, the mysterious banging echoed throughout the hall and, having no one else to relate to me during this troublesome experience, I was left in total loneliness, in an isolation that very few of our species could comprehend. I tossed and turned, I remember, covering my ears with my pillow, curled into the fetal position (oh, to be a child again, in total ignorance!). At some point, though, as if Providence had allowed me to fall into idleness, I fell asleep into obscurity and peace.¬†

I woke up in a haze, unaware of the horrors that must‚Äôve transpired during my slumber. Peaking my head out from my door, I saw that utter chaos enveloped our small, inconsequential station. Flickering lights and broken-down doors littered the hallway as I slowly walked down, stepping with caution and uncertainty. A primal fear inhibiting my senses, I entered into the lounge area, where the cushions of couches were destroyed, brown coffee on the table spilled, the latter apparently mixed with the red blood of my coworkers. I had not seen any bodies, however, so perhaps those colleagues of mine had bested whatever beast was the origin of this devastation.¬†

A fire axe was clung to the wall in an adjacent hall, still kept in its glass capsule. Not knowing what threat I may face, I seized the axe from its confines, my hands clenching the long wooden handle in anxious desperation. All the while, the faint banging of the night‚Äôs previous loud cry reverberated throughout the halls, as if to mock me and my pitiful situation.¬†*Bang, bang, bang, bang*. Is this my purgatory? A hell undeserved?¬†

Suddenly, a noise was heard in an adjacent hallway, not the thump heard reverberating through the station, but more like footsteps‚Äîloud, hulking footsteps. Could this possibly be one of my missing colleagues? A vanished friend? A sense of desperation, doubt and anticipation filled my heart, as it was beating out of my chest, similar to the cryptic drumming resonance echoing through the facility. There was only one way to find out‚Äîto venture into the abyss.

As I progressed down the narrow corridors, the wretched smell of seaweed‚Äìironically, a noxious odour I have always abhorred!‚Äîfilled my nostrils, as those soft, yet heavy footsteps could be heard in the near distance. An oddity I noticed was the footprints, a dense, wet trail of saltwater leading towards that dreaded chamber; could this yet be hope of rescue?¬†

Stepping into the metal archway of that loathsome hallway, the one that the trail inevitably led to, I looked down the gray hallway, as in the dim, fluttering light, I saw a silhouette of someone‚Äîor something. I was stunned immediately, frozen in fear at the creature stalking me from just mere meters away. Standing in the hallway, an apex predator staring and taunting its inevitable prey, was a large, bulky man‚Äîso I thought‚Äîstagnant and unmoving, the stench of seaweed ever more present, and horrendous. I dared not move, but this creature took two mere steps before it was many feet nearer to me. But it was this time‚Äîthis dreaded time!‚Äîthat I was able to see the beast to the best of my ability, as it stood in a fluorescent light. I am moved not to tell of its figure, but for the sake of a warning and evidence for my horrors experienced, this cadaver was the most foul, ghastly thing that I have ever encountered.¬†

But oh! I beheld the tanned suit that it was wearing, fixtures of patches, belts, and antique equipment stuck headfirst on a torso so soaked in saltwater and ocean chaf, with the addition of trailing tubes for breathing. But what was I looking at? I knew in my heart what I was witnessing, but I dared not entertain that idea in the moment. It was its face, however, that was the most frightening of all, bequeathed with sores, scars, leading eyes, a concave cranium‚Äîa melting, gangrenous, gelatinous horror. If this thing were a man in a previous life, then he is a man no more. Indeed, this beast made an Ancient Egyptian mummy look like a gentleman in the midst of the decadence of Sodom and Gomorrah!¬†

Clutching the axe with maximum force, I hurried myself into a defensive stance, ready to combat the creature from Lucifer‚Äôs lair. It inched closer to me, closing the gap between the moral and immoral, its awkward, gawky strut further accentuating its supernatural composition. Just as it was mere feet away, I held up the axe to strike in self-defense, just as Thor would plummet his hammer upon those mythological giants of old. But before I could make contact with the edge of my weapon, a large, slimy tentacle‚Äîlike that of the great Kraken!‚Äîprotruded from the side abdomen of the monster, clutching to the head of my axe. A great struggle ensued, a grappling of a tool between that which was alive and that which was undead. Unfortunately for me, my opponent was able to seize the axe due to its enormous strength, almost taking me with it into its abysmal vacuum of a perverted body.¬†

The beast, beholding my only physical line of defense, snapped it in two, as primitive man would‚Äôve done to the weakly-branched weapon of his adversary. Having no other means to counter the hostile mariner who had seemingly raised from the dead‚Äî‚Äúit‚Äôs alive!‚Äù as Victor Frankenstein once so presciently said‚ÄîI could only turn and run, trying to avoid flailing tendrils. My pulse faster than the thumping of a cottontail, lightning circulating through my veins, I dashed through the tight, narrow corridors of our facility, intermittently jumping over the metal door frames flowering from the bottom of the haul. From the few, erratic turns over my shoulder to see my pursuer, I saw that¬†*it*¬†was using not just the one tentacle from our scourge, but multiple, to propel itself through the halls (like an octopus!), barreling like a bullet towards me.¬†

Though I was under so much duress that I couldn‚Äôt discern which location I was in the facility, memory-consciousness moved me to turn right down another hall, hopefully affording me a couple of more seconds of life to live. Even in the monotony of the ever-countinous, silver, steel-doored halls, I was able to discern the hall that I turned into‚Äîthat which held our scientific laboratories. Was this to be my mortal preservation?¬†

Then, with the last desperate breaths my body could produce with my exertion, I jumped into the room where I did the bulk of my research‚Äîand thus knew the best. I swung my body back around, only able to see the shadow of that diver clinging to the hall walls like a cancer, before I slammed the metal door and locked it with its mighty bolt, proving that, yes, this place was my preservation. I was saved, protected!¬†*Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,*¬†was heard from the other side of the iron wall, the walls shaking around me, lights flickering like a lightning storm. As my body shook, my nerves shocked, and holding the door so that it couldn‚Äôt get into my refuge, the banging on the door suddenly ceased, as if there had been no commotion to begin with. Perspiration lining my face, savoring the moment that the havoc stopped, I quickly looked around the room, the bronze shine of the helmet, those hollow blackened eyes stared back into me, into my very soul.¬†

As I write this, the banging on the steel door, though inconsistent and erratic, still reverberates throughout the hall of the facility‚Äî*Bang, bang, bang, bang*. No matter how often I turn the helmet away from me, it always, as if it had a consciousness and autonomy of its own, turns itself back to stare at me, in mockery. I cannot help but think that it was my colleagues and I, after commandeering the artifact from its original habitation, who awoke some old, ancient curse, that of a deceased mariner, one who is so repulsed with his own heinousness that he would do whatever to get back the one thing that shielded him from judging eyes‚Äîhis diving helmet. And yet, I cannot open the door to return his capital, for I know what my fate would be‚Äîthe same damnable one as my former colleagues! But the time must come when a man must face his inevitable fate, that he shall no longer hold to the burdens of morality and will be released from his natural state of existence‚Äîthe only existence he had hitherto known.

So this burden had been transfixed upon me, Robert Leng, a man who only wanted to explore the unknown, study that which most cannot understand, to see those small, minute things that Providence has made that have gone unnoticed through the annals of history. My last wish, though, is not for another chance to live, but for the work, the livelihoods, of not just myself, but also that of the likes of Dr. Cousar, and my most amiable colleagues‚Äîthose who sacrificed themselves, unwittingly, because of the innate curiosity of the human experience, and of the mere benign state of the finding, resulting in their deaths. No, I wish this message to be heard by whoever may read it, by anyone who can spread the word that there are things that are better to be left alone down in the depths of Davy Jones‚Äô Locker.

The incessant¬†*bang, bang, bang, bang*¬†is the only constant companion I have left with me‚Äîand the puppet master that controls its strings‚Ä¶",2,1758649886.0,creepcast,5,1.0,False

[Nagano Tonic Review](https://preview.redd.it/k8qlkmsdcyqf1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=7179ea6666e7060621dc72fb8fc696e2fd0b6f6f)

I remember staring at myself in the mirror one morning, shirt halfway buttoned, and thinking: **‚ÄúHow did I get here?‚Äù** The sluggish mornings, the brain fog, the weight creeping in around the edges of my confidence‚Äîit all felt like life pressing down harder than it used to. I wasn‚Äôt looking for a miracle, but I knew I needed something to pull me back into the driver‚Äôs seat.

That‚Äôs when I came across this tonic. I didn‚Äôt expect much‚Äîanother supplement, another promise. But I figured, why not? **Within a few weeks, the shift was undeniable.** Energy in the morning wasn‚Äôt forced anymore. My focus at work sharpened like I‚Äôd cleaned off a dirty lens. The cravings that usually knocked me off track lost their grip. And the number on the scale? Finally moving in the right direction.

But the real story isn‚Äôt just about pounds lost or a jolt of energy. It‚Äôs about what happens when the fog lifts. **I closed two new deals in a single week, both of which I‚Äôd been chasing for months.** I had the energy to show up differently‚Äîto lead conversations with presence, not distraction. That edge became my secret weapon.

People started noticing. Not just the physical changes, but the way I carried myself again. Meetings that used to drag? I was the one setting the pace. Ideas that used to feel just out of reach? Now they were flowing fast, sharp, actionable. The tonic became more than part of my routine‚Äîit became the trigger for momentum in every area of my life.

**Here‚Äôs the part most people miss:** success doesn‚Äôt start with a business strategy, a marketing funnel, or a 10-step plan. It starts with the energy you bring to the table. If your body is running on fumes, you can have all the tactics in the world and still spin your wheels.

That‚Äôs why this shift mattered. It wasn‚Äôt about chasing hacks‚Äîit was about upgrading the one system that controls everything else: me.

I‚Äôve recommended it to close friends, not because I‚Äôm selling something, but because I watched what it did for me. **More energy, clearer focus, real weight loss, and the kind of confidence that compounds into bigger wins.** If you‚Äôre tired of waiting for the perfect moment to turn things around, this is it.

Alright, let‚Äôs get into the guts of it. When people ask me how this tonic actually worked for me, I don‚Äôt sugarcoat it‚ÄîI break it down. Because it wasn‚Äôt just some vague ‚Äúfelt better‚Äù moment. It was systematic.

At first, I noticed the **mornings changed**. Usually, I‚Äôd drag myself out of bed, slam coffee, and hope the caffeine hit before my first call. With the tonic, it was different. Within 15‚Äì20 minutes of drinking it, I felt alert without the jittery edge. My energy curve smoothed out‚Äîno more peaks and brutal crashes.

Then came the **cravings**. Midday, I was usually the guy raiding the snack drawer, telling myself it was ‚Äújust one cookie.‚Äù But this time, the constant pull toward junk food wasn‚Äôt there. My appetite felt‚Ä¶ leveled out. That was a game changer because willpower alone never lasted for me.

By week three, the scale started moving. **Steady fat loss‚Äînot dramatic, not gimmicky, but real.** My belt tightened, my face leaned out, and for the first time in years, I saw momentum on my side. The difference was my metabolism actually felt alive again, like I wasn‚Äôt stuck in slow gear anymore.

But here‚Äôs the part that surprised me the most: **mental clarity**. I didn‚Äôt expect that. Work calls that used to feel draining were now opportunities I leaned into. I wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúgetting through the day,‚Äù I was ahead of it. That extra edge gave me confidence, and confidence spills into everything‚Äîclosing clients, negotiating harder, pushing projects across the finish line.

Physically, the ingredients clicked for me in a way coffee and random supplements never did. I later learned it had metabolism boosters, adaptogens for stress, and digestion support built in. That explained the balanced energy and lighter, less bloated feeling I noticed after meals. It wasn‚Äôt about masking fatigue‚Äîit was about recalibrating my system so I could perform at full throttle again.

Here‚Äôs the truth: **this didn‚Äôt just change my health‚Äîit changed my output.** The energy, the focus, the confidence‚Ä¶ it stacked. And stacking is everything when you‚Äôre chasing success. That‚Äôs why I keep it as a non-negotiable in my daily routine.

**What is Nagano Tonic?**  
It‚Äôs a natural metabolism booster designed to increase energy, support weight loss, and improve focus. Unlike typical supplements, it works as a morning tonic you mix into water, making it easy to start your day with.

**How does Nagano Tonic help with weight loss?**  
Nagano Tonic uses a blend of natural ingredients like green tea extract, cinnamon, and bitter melon to target stubborn fat, reduce cravings, and support healthy digestion. This combination helps your body burn calories more efficiently while keeping your appetite in check.

**How long does it take to see results?**  
Most people report feeling an energy boost and better focus within the first week. Visible weight loss and body composition changes typically show up within 3‚Äì4 weeks of consistent use.

**Is Nagano Tonic safe to take daily?**  
Yes. It‚Äôs made with natural ingredients and produced in a facility that follows strict safety standards. Still, if you‚Äôre on medication or have medical conditions, consult your healthcare provider before starting.

**Can Nagano Tonic replace exercise or a healthy diet?**  
No supplement is a magic bullet. Nagano Tonic works best when paired with balanced eating and regular activity. Think of it as a catalyst‚Äîhelping your body perform at a higher level so you can see faster results.

**Does Nagano Tonic really boost energy and focus?**  
Yes. Many users notice improved mental clarity, steady energy throughout the day, and fewer crashes compared to caffeine-heavy alternatives.

But even then‚Äîespecially then‚ÄîI choose you.Every day.Every moment.
Why?Because of the fireworks in your laugh,the lightning in your eyes,the memories we haven‚Äôt made yet‚Äîthe ones I can‚Äôt imagine making with anyone else.
Right now, our love is quiet.A whisper.A soft breath against my cheek.A brush of your hand that says:Still here.
It won‚Äôt always be this way.Our love can be thunder.It can quake mountains‚Äîit raised kids.Grown now.Good people.Our love did that.
But this chapter?It‚Äôs slow.Dormant.Smoldering coals on a cold October morning.
And I still believe in the spark.I believe in coffee tasting like coffee again,in hugs solving things,in birdsong returning to the windowsill.
For now, it‚Äôs quiet.A whisper.A brush of your hand.
But that whisper?It holds the chorus of my favorite song.And that touch?It ignites the cold morning fireand warms the house that is my soul.
In quiet mornings,in the hush of the ordinary,I‚Äôll choose you.When words fall short,when our hands find each other‚ÄîI‚Äôll choose you,soft as breath,steady as home.

1nonxxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/disneyparks/comments/1nonxxs/threeday_trip_review_disneylandcalifornia/,Three-Day Trip Review Disneyland/California Adventure,"The following information is based on my three-day vacation to Disneyland/California Adventure on Sept. 15-17. It was me and my wife, our 2.5-year-old son and our friend who lives in California.¬†We had the three-day Costco parkhopper tickets with Lightning Lane and $30 meal credit.

LODGING. We stayed at Alpine Inn. It was clean, the staff was friendly, and it was about a 15-minute walk to and from Disneyland/California Adventure. If you do the pre-check-in, you can park your car in the parking lot and you‚Äôll get a notification as soon as your room is ready. Check-in is at 3, but our room was ready by 1, allowing us to come back from the park to get our things unpacked and rest for the afternoon. If you‚Äôre trying to keep things affordable, I would recommend this place. There‚Äôs no continental breakfast, but they do serve coffee, tea and hot chocolate in the morning, and have ice water so you can fill up your water bottles before you leave for the day.¬†

CHARACTER DINING. We ate Mickey‚Äôs Autumn Adventures Brunch Buffet at Storyteller‚Äôs Cafe in Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa. The buffet had a variety of food for all taste buds. The maple-glazed chicken legs were especially tasty. My toddler loved the Mickey waffles. We got to meet Mickey, Minnie, Pluto, Chip, and Dale. Some came around more than once. The characters interacted with all of us. Pluto licked my head. Minnie tried to feed my son food. Mickey was excited to see me wearing a shirt with his face on it and a birthday pin. The pure joy and giggling on my son‚Äôs face warmed my daddy-heart. They also brought out a cupcake and a candle for my birthday. I haven‚Äôt been to Goofy‚Äôs Kitchen (the other character dining location), so I can‚Äôt compare it to our experience.

FOOD. We ate Cafe Orleans in New Orleans Square for dinner on our second day. The architecture and indoor design were beautiful, and the atmosphere was pleasant. I ordered the Cajun Butter Roasted Chicken and my wife ordered the Monte Cristo Sandwich, both of which we were really pleased with. I don‚Äôt normally love green beans, but the ones I had here were delicious. We ate a Mickey Pretzel at Refreshment Corner while a lively gentleman played the piano and told corny Halloween jokes. I also loved my Chili Cone Queso in a bread bowl cone from Cozy Cone Motel in DCA and my wife loved her Troubadour Baked Potato from Troubadour Tavern in DL. We ate a decent dinner at Lucky Fortune Cookie in San Fransokyo Square in DCA. The only stinker was Alien Pizza Planet in Tomorrowland. I knew to expect expensive food prices, but the $80+ for one pizza really gave me sticker shock. Of course, we couldn‚Äôt pass up an opportunity to enjoy a Dole Whip Float as we strolled around the park.¬†

RIDES. We decided early on that we weren‚Äôt going to wait in lines longer than 30 minutes unless we had a pass from Lightning Lane. We used Lightning Lane for Space Mountain, Matterhorn, Smuggler‚Äôs Run, the Haunted Mansion, Buzz Lightyear‚Äôs Astro Blasters, and Monsters, Inc. Mike & Sulley to the Rescue! We used the single rider lane for the Incredi-Coaster. We were able to do Rider Switch with our kid on a few rides, and the ride attendant at Matterhorn let my wife ride with me and then with our friend. Because we had a toddler, we prioritized his experiences, so there were a bunch of adult rides we ultimately didn‚Äôt have time for. My son‚Äôs favorite ride was Disneyland Railroad (we rode this three times) because he loves trains, and he loved seeing the animals and dinosaurs during the Grand Canyon portion of the ride. He also loved Dumbo the Flying Elephant and the Mark Twain Riverboat. He kept asking for ‚Äúmore rides‚Äù and ‚Äúmore animals‚Äù every day. My wife and I‚Äôs favorite ride was the Incredi-Coaster. The longest lines we waited in were Jungle Cruise (which was packed, hot, and stuffy) and, surprisingly, the LL for Smuggler‚Äôs Run (we thought maybe we took a wrong turn into the standby lane). The line for Rise of the Resistance was always 60+ minutes, and we didn‚Äôt want to purchase an extra $30 LL per person.¬†I especially loved the Nightmare Before Christmas overlay at the Haunted Mansion.

SHOWS. I can‚Äôt express how much fun it was attending Turtle Talk with Crush and Finding Dory pals, Mickey's PhilharMagic, and Mickey‚Äôs Trick or Treat, all three right in a row. Our son was just entertained the whole hour we attended these.¬†

NIGHTTIME SHOWS. If you‚Äôre hoping to wait until the last minute to pick your seats for parades, fireworks, or any other evening entertainment, you won‚Äôt find a good seat. People start lining up hours before. Paint the Night parade in DL and World of Color Happiness in DCA were both stunning shows. We were lucky to find decent spots for the parade because we didn‚Äôt realize how far ahead people grabbed their seats on the curb. For WOCH, we camped out for two hours to secure our spots. It was at the WOCH that I got emotional as the show started and Joy from Inside Out was projected onto the water with the core memory music playing. I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if we were creating a core memory for my son, giving him something that would stick with him for years.¬†

CHARACTERS. After my son‚Äôs reaction to the character dining, we made it a point to schedule a block of time to meet characters from Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. We were able to meet and get autographs from Mickey, Minnie, Daisy, Goofy, and Clarabelle at town square within about an hour‚Äôs timeframe. Pluto was here, but my son was distracted by a new friend with bubbles. My son loved handing the pen and autograph book to everyone.¬†

SPECIAL TREATMENT. We picked up first time pins for my wife and son and a birthday pin for me. I got plenty of birthday wishes throughout the trip. When we sat in the first car of the train during our first ride, Conductor Mark got out to talk to our son at every stop. When we departed, he handed our son a postcard of a train. While we were waiting for characters on our last day, a cast member handed our son a special Disneyland sticker.

SOUVENEERS. My wife and I picked out ornaments for each other and a family ornament that we had customized from Plaza Point. We also got a customized Mickey hat with our son‚Äôs name on it from the Mad Hatter. We also sat for our silhouettes at Silhouette Studio and had those framed. That last one was special to me because my late grandparents did the same thing when they were in Disney World and we have a framed copy of it sitting in our dining room.

At forty-five in her previous life, she suffered from severe depression. William left her alone at home. In the end, she locked herself in the kitchen and turned on the gas, ending her life.

All these were caused by a woman‚ÄîWilliam's cherished one.

Emily furrowed her brows, knowing that woman would seek her out today. She'd prepared divorce papers in advance.

This was the Cafe William frequented‚Äîa place etched in her memory forever.

In her past life, it was here that he often met his lover in secret.

She hadn't found out the truth until she followed him here one day.

When she demanded answers, he slapped her and coldly said: ""What happens between us is none of your concern.""

That day, she crouched in a corner near the Cafe and wept for a long time.

She'd been twenty-five then too.

Now, clarity struck Emily.

She had wasted her devotion on someone who didn't deserve it‚Äîshe had loved the wrong person for so many years.

Until death, William never truly looked at her.

This second chance was for herself.

Frowning, she gripped the Cafe doorknob and turned it.

A soothing coffee fragrance enveloped her as she spotted Sophia Lee in the corner.

Sophia sat opposite her, expression icy and detached. ""The one William loves is me. Give up and stop clinging to him.""

Emily slid the divorce papers across the table. ""I'll step aside if you get him to sign this.

Once he signed and the waiting period is over, I'll leave immediately.""

Sophia's eyes widened in surprise at her swift agreement‚Äîso swift she'd give up the title of Mrs. Kennedy.

Emily met her gaze scoffeedily, adding, ""Since he's always wanted you, I'll yield.

Just make sure he signs the papers. After that, whatever happens between you two has nothing to do with me.""

She took a sip of water.

This time, she would never again be that naive ""Mrs. Kennedy"" who was kept in the dark and deceived by everyone.

Sophia's fingers tightened around her cup, glaring. ""Emily, what's your game?""

""No games. Just tired.""

Emily held her stare, unflinching and at peace.

Without another word, she rose to leave.

The Cafe was bustling with people, but to her, it all felt like noise.

Reading Emily's resolve, Sophia's guard lowered. She called after the retreating figure:

""You're handing William to me! Once I'm Mrs. Kennedy, don't expect me to return him.""

Emily walked on without pausing.

Sophia followed her out, swiping her phone to dial William.

He answered unusually fast.

""William, can you pick me up now?

I'm at the Noble Baker Cafe.""



Emily stood just one traffic light away from her, a bitter smile tugging at her lips.

She remembered in her previous life, none of her calls to William were ever answered.

But now, barely moments after the red light switched, the man himself appeared at the entrance of the Cafe.

Emily turned to see him leaning against the glass window in a tailored black suit.

His frame stood tall and straight, broad-shouldered with a narrow waist.

He handed Sophia the cake he carried, bending close to whisper he'd asked his chef for extra blueberries‚Äîher favorite.

Despite herself, Emily's heart twisted painfully.
Chapter 2

Throughout three years of marriage, William never cared about her preferences.

Even when she was hospitalized in her last life, he showed up with durian‚Äîthe one fruit she couldn't stand. That day, she forced herself to eat it, then turned away and cried silently.

Now William's velvet voice drifted to Emily as she watched his lips brush Sophia's forehead.

""What would you like?

I'll take you anywhere.""

His tender tone dripped affection.

Sophia nestled closer, sliding Emily's divorce papers toward him‚Äî

conveniently covering the words ""Divorce Agreement.""

""There's just one thing I need you to help me with. Could you sign this?

I've found a house in the suburbs...""

William took the pen, eyes locked on Sophia as he swiftly signed where she pointed.

""Buy whatever you fancy.""

He finished by gently stroking her hair.

Acid churned in Emily's stomach.

William, in this life I won't look back.

Her thoughts shattered when another car arrived.

A man and a woman hurried to William's side, all smiles and flattery.

""So you're getting our Sophia a villa?"" Charlotte Lee chirped, signaling her daughter.

""Then we can all live together!""

Sophia instantly pressed against William's chest, gushing about his generosity.

Emily stood frozen, witnessing their perfect family picture.

In her past life, she'd knelt in rain for a day begging him to shelter her dying mother.

The memory choked her with swallowed bitterness.

As Emily turned to leave, William's voice rose:

""You're all welcome anytime.

I'll have the housekeeper prepare rooms for all three of you.""

Four faces beamed in shared delight.

So her mother's sanctuary was merely his ""adopted housekeeper"" to outsiders.

An invisible fist clenched Emily's heart, suffocating her.

William's lips curved gently‚Äîa tenderness she'd never seen.
Chapter 3

In her last life before she died, she'd called William: ""Did you ever love me?""

His icy voice, devoid of emotion, struck like a death sentence:

""Never!""



As she closed her eyes, her only wish was that if there was an afterlife, she would never live such a life again.

Never to fall in love with William again, nor become Mrs. Kennedy.

When Emily arrived home, it was already late, but the lights in the living room were still on.

She went straight upstairs to pack her belongings, casually tossing photos of her and William, including his shirts and stacks of love letters filled with false affection, into the courtyard. She set everything ablaze.

The flames gathered into a beam, as if trying to ignite the night.

""What are you doing!""

William's voice suddenly cut through from behind her.

Emily turned to find him standing at the door, holding the hand of an unfamiliar child.

William frowned at the flames in the yard, fetched a bucket of water, and doused the fire.

Yet his scrutiny of Emily never wavered.

""Uncle!

Why is Auntie burning things here?""

The child beside him stared at Emily in bewilderment.

William's face darkened. ""I just picked up Sophia this afternoon. Was that worth such rage?

Burning everything?""

""I'm not angry!""

Emily replied flatly.

""Is Auntie mad at my mommy?

Mommy said you're my daddy now, but a daddy can only choose one to be my mommy. So Auntie's angry?""

Emily's heart clenched‚Äîshe hadn't realized this was Sophia's child, brought home by William.

""This is Sophia's son, John Lee. His father ran off, but I adore him, so I brought him home.""

Emily let out a chuckle.

After all these years, William never wanted a child with her. Yet today, because it was Sophia's, he brought home another man's son and embraced him as his own.

Her chest felt slit open by a knife, bleeding ceaselessly.

William raised an eyebrow, scooped John up high. ""If Uncle takes you out to play, what will you call me?""

John giggled on his shoulder. ""Mommy taught me‚ÄîDaddy.""

Numbness shot from head to toe, freezing Emily's voice.

That doting smile felt utterly foreign to her.

She studied the child intently, sensing an odd familiarity.

As the fire dwindled, the driver hauled in piles of toys. With William's gesture, he carried them into the sunniest room.

""Enough. Burn whatever you want another day. John lives here now‚Äîhe'll be scared.""

Seeing Emily still in the yard, he snapped impatiently toward the door.

Only after entering did Eleanor Li Martin stumble out from the kitchen, gasping.

""Listen, Emily‚Äîour whole family depends on him now. Don't you dare make trouble.""

Eleanor seized her wrist, teeth clenched.

Emily shook her off and climbed the stairs alone.

Eleanor had always been snobbish. Ever since learning her precious daughter landed a wealthy son-in-law, she'd insisted on moving in.



Not only would she sometimes not speak up for Emily, but she'd also threaten her with her life, all to make her endure humiliation in the Kennedy family and fulfill her dream of becoming a wealthy mother-in-law.

Lying in bed, she only felt her eyes stinging.

Beside her, William was already sound asleep, breathing scoffeedily.

Emily tossed and turned, unable to sleep, until her phone screen suddenly lit up, and she slowly sat up.

It was a message from Sophia.

She opened it. It was a paternity test report, showing thatJohn and William were father and son.
Chapter 4

Emily felt dazed, her face showing shock, almost dropping her phone.

She lay on her side with her back to William, but her heart felt as if it were being torn apart.

""Well?

Do you like this gift?""

Sophia's next message came right after, ""Actually, I should be the true lady of this house.

And you, you're just a placeholder.""

Emily clenched her phone tightly. So long ago, he and Sophia already had a child together.

In her past life, she'd lived entirely under his deception.

Outside her world, that was his real family.

She sat in bed like that all night, watching William the entire time.

But soon, she'd leave for good, just as they wished.

William would never find her again.

At dawn, Emily, with swollen eyes, was about to get out of bed.

William's arms reached out but found nothing. He rubbed his eyes and looked at her.

""Still mad about yesterday?""

He moved close, and a ray of sunlight from the window fell on Emily's face.

""No.""

She got up and started folding yesterday's unfolded clothes.

William, seeing she didn't even glance at him, got angry and grabbed her wrist mid-fold. ""Emily.""

His voice turned icy. ""In front of the child yesterday, I didn't argue. Don't be so childish and stubborn.""

She twitched her lips and kept folding.

Soon, William was dressed and standing before her‚Äî

white shirt, black leather jacket, and faded jeans‚Äîa total shift from his usual business style.

William had never dressed like that around her.

""Do I look good like this?""

He turned and asked her.

Seeing her still bent over folding, William angrily threw all the clothes from the wardrobe onto the bed.

""You'd better keep up this act forever and keep your mouth shut forever.""

With that, he slammed the door and left.

Only when the slam faded completely did Emily slowly raise her eyes.

Everything about William now meant nothing to her.

Once the divorce waiting period ended, nothing would tie them together.

Eleanor came from the kitchen, passed the dining room, gave Sophia a respectful nod, then pulled Emily into a side room and locked the door.

""Emily, what are you doing?

How come you can't even hold on to a man?

You let some homewrecker get close to him and move in. Have you thought how we'll live now?""

Emily leaned against the door. Now she felt more like an outsider in this house.



""We'll move out once the divorce waiting period ends.""

Eleanor's face instantly darkened as she slapped Emily hard across the cheek.

""How dare you divorce?!

!

I'm not leaving this place!""
Chapter 5

""Miss Lee, your hands are too delicate for this dirty work. Let me handle it.""

Emily stood frozen, watching her own mother scurry from the kitchen to bow and scrape before them.

Her heart felt hollowed out, a sudden chill making her shiver.

Eleanor grabbed a rag and began scrubbing the table after speaking.

To William, this was precisely where she belonged.

While Sophia had instantly become the treasure he cradled in his heart.

Emily ignored them, retreating to her room to pack her belongings.

After nearly finishing, she collapsed onto the bed for a nap.

'Buzzzz...'

Her phone abruptly erupted with violent vibrations.

""Emily, get to the hospital now!

See what you've done!""

Emily's heart seized. She arrived to find William looming in the corridor, suit jacket slung over his arm, tie hanging loose. Sophia crouched nearby, sobbing uncontrollably.

Spotting Emily, William strode forward and struck her. Fury burned in his eyes.

""Why did you tell your mother to serve John seafood? He's allergic! Trying to kill him?!

!""

William closed in, his shadow swallowing her whole.

""I didn't!""

Emily met his glare. ""I never left my room.""

""Still lying?

Your mother confessed you told her John loves seafood! She cooked it on your orders!""

William gripped her chin, rage undiminished.

Sophia suddenly lunged from the floor, pounding Emily's chest with furious blows.

""Did you poison us because John and I moved in? Waiting till William and I were gone to murder us? You monster!

Rot in hell!""

Emily staggered and fell, but Sophia kept kicking and punching.

Only when exhausted did Sophia finally drop her fists.

Emily ignored the screams, feeling like waterlogged cotton choked her throat.

She stood numb, fists clenched tight.

Her own mother had pinned this massive blame squarely on her.

A bitter smile touched her lips as family love's thorn pierced her heart, drawing blood.

""The child is stable now.""

The ward door swung open, a nurse stepping out.

Sophia shoved past Emily blocking the doorway.

""What happened?""

William demanded, voice low.

Inside, John clutched his throat, whimpering, ""It hurts, Daddy, it hurts.""

Eleanor hovered nearby, explaining, ""Emily told me to cook seafood.""

William's gaze turned icy as he glanced toward the door. Emily's arm was instantly seized.

Before she could react, a pungent sting flooded her nostrils.



Immediately, her mouth was forced open by a hand, and a jar of extremely spicy pepper water poured down her throat.

""No...""
Chapter 6

Emily's words choked in her throat, the intense spice instantly flooding her airway, the burning pain scorching her relentlessly.

Her face quickly swelled from the overwhelming heat.

""Ugh... no...""

Tears streamed as she coughed, her trust in William swallowed along with the pepper water.

Until her vision blurred, Emily watched William and the other two disappear into the distance, then collapsed unconscious.

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

...

She didn't know how long she'd been out, but when she woke, the hospital room was empty except for her.

Emily pressed a hand to her chest, tears flowing freely. She shut her eyes, taking moments to steady herself.

Her phone suddenly rang‚Äîthe airline confirming flight details.

She listened weakly to the tedious verification, finally murmuring, ""Window seat, thanks.""

The call ended just as the door swung open.

Her mother entered, dressed plainly with dust on her pants.

""Emily, don't blame mom.

I... I just wanted to peel exotic fruit for John, but who knew he was allergic to seafood!

I can't handle this responsibility‚Äîyou know I can't lose my job.""

Emily stared at the ceiling, fighting back tears.

Her own mother would sacrifice her without hesitation to save herself.

The bond she cherished was just a bargaining chip to her birth mother.

Days later, Emily saw Sophia's post on social media.

In the video, John proudly told friends, ""This is my mom!""

A friend eyed William and added, ""So if she's your mom, he must be your daddy!""

John blushed and ducked his head without explaining.

Sophia and William exchanged glances, chuckling softly.

Her nails dug into her palms as she suddenly laughed.

The laugh stung her eyes with bitterness.

She'd leave soon‚Äîthis house and William behind.
Chapter 7

A week later, at the villa entrance.

Emily had just returned from the hospital.

Then a sharp pain exploded at the back of her head!

Warm blood instantly trickled down.

Emily touched the spot and whirled around, meeting John's innocent face.

A shattered vase lay nearby. As she turned, he stuck out his tongue: ""Stop hogging my dad!

This is your lesson!""

Eleanor walked in, frozen in panic at the scene.

""What are you doing?""

""Bang!""

The door burst open, and John instantly dropped his gaze, sobbing.

""What happened?""

William's low voice reached Emily. Sophia trailed behind him, stunned silent.

""Uncle William, I saw Aunt Emily just got home.



I just told her about what happened at the training camp, but not only did she refuse to listen, she got angry instantly and even threw a vase at me..."" John cried as he ran toward William, showing him the bruises on his arm.

John's hand was bleeding now, probably from the broken vase shards.

Emily felt a flicker of surprise‚Äîshe had no idea when John got those bruises.

""I didn't...""

Smack!

A crisp sound echoed as Sophia's palm struck her face.

""You poisonous woman. If you dare lay a finger on my son again, I'll fight you to the death.""

Ignoring the shrill accusation, Emily cradled her stinging cheek and walked straight upstairs.

Blood stained her clothes, the sticky sensation making her unbearably uncomfortable, yet William hadn't even noticed.

Halfway up, she turned back to look at William and suddenly laughed.

""William, in your heart, did you ever trust me even a little?""

As she spoke, coffeers welled up in her eyes.

William's pupils contracted sharply, freezing the air around them.

But he only replied flatly, ""You and I never had any affection to begin with. You hurt a child right before my eyes and expect me to believe you?""

Emily laughed harder, each chuckle piercing her chest like a knife as coffeers streamed down her face.

Of course. He didn't love her. Not for all these years, not ever.

She'd clung to him with foolish devotion, wasting years by his side only to never earn a single genuine glance.

She should've known this long ago.

""Alright, William.""

Sophia stepped forward, linking arms with him. ""John must be terrified. Let's take him to his room.""

William cast one last fleeting look at Emily before turning away, scooping up the child and leading Sophia out.

Emily watched their retreating figures, lowering her eyes.

She hated her past self for misjudging people.

But this time would be different.

Two days later, at John's birthday banquet.

William had booked the entire floor.

Emily stood in a corner, watching John circle around William endlessly, her gaze gradually darkening.

Guests streamed past her, each shooting disdainful looks her way.

""Who really runs the Kenney family now? Isn't it obvious?""

""Seems Miss Lee is the true Mrs. Kennedy after all.

She must've used some dirty tricks to stay by William Kennedy's side all these years.""

Emily listened quietly, her eyes flickering but showing no reaction.

She felt numb to the pain now.
Chapter 8

As she turned toward the elevator, Sophia followed her inside.

Touching up her lipstick, Sophia shot Emily a sidelong glance. ""Your agreement takes effect in two days. You'll leave, won't you?""

Emily pressed the lobby button and murmured, ""Yes.""

Sophia smiled with satisfaction. ""I trust Ms Martin honors her promises.""

Emily averted her eyes.

But the next instant‚Äîthud!

The elevator suddenly shook violently.

Sophia was trapped inside, pounding desperately on the doors to no avail.



Another loud bang, and the elevator plummeted down.

""Ah!""

Sophia inside screamed out.

Emily frantically pulled out her phone, ""William, come quick!

The elevator's broken!

Sophia's trapped inside.""

She kept banging on the elevator door, hoping to get a response from Sophia.

William came running over, his steps hurried and short.

""What's going on?""

He'd barely stopped when he started calling Sophia's name, panting heavily.

It took a while for the rescuers to show up. They shouted through the door, ""How are you?

Are you okay?""

""Help me,"" Sophia screamed, banging on the door, ""My foot's stuck.""

A screech of metal prying open, and a beam of light shone through.

In a daze, she only saw William kneeling on the ground, frantically checking Sophia's injuries.

Sophia's leg was completely crushed and bleeding. Without a second thought, William picked her up and ran to the hospital.

But Sophia, with her arms around William's neck, sobbed out Emily's name.

""It was her, it was her.

She saw the elevator was broken and pushed me in, then ran out herself.""

Hearing this, Emily felt like she'd been struck by lightning.

""It wasn't me!""

She quickly retorted.

But William was already furious and had no patience for her explanation.

""You're vicious,"" William ordered the security guards nearby, ""Throw her into the elevator and lock her in.""

Emily stood there dumbfounded. She couldn't believe he'd actually put her in danger over a single sentence.

They carried her into the elevator. She watched helplessly as the doors closed again, plunging her into darkness.

The elevator was still broken. In an instant, she felt the floor give way beneath her.

Suddenly, the elevator lost support and plummeted down!

With a sickening crunch, twisted metal slammed into her leg. Excruciating pain shot through her.

Emily passed out completely...

It wasn't until the pungent smell of disinfectant hit her nose that Emily managed to open her eyes.

""Ms. Martin, you're awake?""

The nurse said while changing her IV bag and dressing, ""Your leg bone was crushed. You were covered in blood when you arrived.

Any later and we might have had to amputate.""

William was cold-hearted. Those close to him would get hurt.

Besides, she'd long since vanished from his sight.

Emily stared blankly at the ceiling, then let out a low laugh.

The image of William desperately helping Sophia lingered in her mind.

He was capable of love, just not for her.

She dragged herself up and called her mother, asking her to bring her packed luggage to the airport first thing tomorrow.

All she heard from the other end was a few curses: ""If you leave, don't ever come back.""

Emily dug her nails into her palms. From now on, she and William would have nothing to do with each other.

She'd vanish completely from his world, taking everything of hers with her.

She'd start a new life from now on.

One day later, at the Airport.



Emily boarded the plane with her suitcase, taking a final glance at the home she'd known for years.

Far away lies her future.

William, goodbye.

May we both be well, and never cross paths again.

1nonx2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlanning/comments/1nonx2n/threeday_trip_review_for_disneylandcalifornia/,Three-Day Trip Review for Disneyland/California Adventure,"The following information is based on my three-day vacation to Disneyland/California Adventure on Sept. 15-17. It was me and my wife, our 2.5-year-old son and our friend who lives in California.¬†We had the three-day Costco parkhopper tickets with Lightning Lane and $30 meal credit.

LODGING. We stayed at Alpine Inn. It was clean, the staff was friendly, and it was about a 15-minute walk to and from Disneyland/California Adventure. If you do the pre-check-in, you can park your car in the parking lot and you‚Äôll get a notification as soon as your room is ready. Check-in is at 3, but our room was ready by 1, allowing us to come back from the park to get our things unpacked and rest for the afternoon. If you‚Äôre trying to keep things affordable, I would recommend this place. There‚Äôs no continental breakfast, but they do serve coffee, tea and hot chocolate in the morning, and have ice water so you can fill up your water bottles before you leave for the day.¬†

CHARACTER DINING. We ate Mickey‚Äôs Autumn Adventures Brunch Buffet at Storyteller‚Äôs Cafe in Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa. The buffet had a variety of food for all taste buds. The maple-glazed chicken legs were especially tasty. My toddler loved the Mickey waffles. We got to meet Mickey, Minnie, Pluto, Chip, and Dale. Some came around more than once. The characters interacted with all of us. Pluto licked my head. Minnie tried to feed my son food. Mickey was excited to see me wearing a shirt with his face on it and a birthday pin. The pure joy and giggling on my son‚Äôs face warmed my daddy-heart. They also brought out a cupcake and a candle for my birthday. I haven‚Äôt been to Goofy‚Äôs Kitchen (the other character dining location), so I can‚Äôt compare it to our experience.

FOOD. We ate Cafe Orleans in New Orleans Square for dinner on our second day. The architecture and indoor design were beautiful, and the atmosphere was pleasant. I ordered the Cajun Butter Roasted Chicken and my wife ordered the Monte Cristo Sandwich, both of which we were really pleased with. I don‚Äôt normally love green beans, but the ones I had here were delicious. We ate a Mickey Pretzel at Refreshment Corner while a lively gentleman played the piano and told corny Halloween jokes. I also loved my Chili Cone Queso in a bread bowl cone from Cozy Cone Motel in DCA and my wife loved her Troubadour Baked Potato from Troubadour Tavern in DL. We ate a decent dinner at Lucky Fortune Cookie in San Fransokyo Square in DCA. The only stinker was Alien Pizza Planet in Tomorrowland. I knew to expect expensive food prices, but the $80+ for one pizza really gave me sticker shock. Of course, we couldn‚Äôt pass up an opportunity to enjoy a Dole Whip Float as we strolled around the park.¬†

RIDES. We decided early on that we weren‚Äôt going to wait in lines longer than 30 minutes unless we had a pass from Lightning Lane. We used Lightning Lane for Space Mountain, Matterhorn, Smuggler‚Äôs Run, the Haunted Mansion, Buzz Lightyear‚Äôs Astro Blasters, and Monsters, Inc. Mike & Sulley to the Rescue! We used the single rider lane for the Incredi-Coaster. We were able to do Rider Switch with our kid on a few rides, and the ride attendant at Matterhorn let my wife ride with me and then with our friend. Because we had a toddler, we prioritized his experiences, so there were a bunch of adult rides we ultimately didn‚Äôt have time for. My son‚Äôs favorite ride was Disneyland Railroad (we rode this three times) because he loves trains, and he loved seeing the animals and dinosaurs during the Grand Canyon portion of the ride. He also loved Dumbo the Flying Elephant and the Mark Twain Riverboat. He kept asking for ‚Äúmore rides‚Äù and ‚Äúmore animals‚Äù every day. My wife and I‚Äôs favorite ride was the Incredi-Coaster. The longest lines we waited in were Jungle Cruise (which was packed, hot, and stuffy) and, surprisingly, the LL for Smuggler‚Äôs Run (we thought maybe we took a wrong turn into the standby lane). The line for Rise of the Resistance was always 60+ minutes, and we didn‚Äôt want to purchase an extra $30 LL per person.¬†I especially loved the Nightmare Before Christmas overlay at the Haunted Mansion.

SHOWS. I can‚Äôt express how much fun it was attending Turtle Talk with Crush and Finding Dory pals, Mickey's PhilharMagic, and Mickey‚Äôs Trick or Treat, all three right in a row. Our son was just entertained the whole hour we attended these.¬†

NIGHTTIME SHOWS. If you‚Äôre hoping to wait until the last minute to pick your seats for parades, fireworks, or any other evening entertainment, you won‚Äôt find a good seat. People start lining up hours before. Paint the Night parade in DL and World of Color Happiness in DCA were both stunning shows. We were lucky to find decent spots for the parade because we didn‚Äôt realize how far ahead people grabbed their seats on the curb. For WOCH, we camped out for two hours to secure our spots. It was at the WOCH that I got emotional as the show started and Joy from Inside Out was projected onto the water with the core memory music playing. I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if we were creating a core memory for my son, giving him something that would stick with him for years.¬†

CHARACTERS. After my son‚Äôs reaction to the character dining, we made it a point to schedule a block of time to meet characters from Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. We were able to meet and get autographs from Mickey, Minnie, Daisy, Goofy, and Clarabelle at town square within about an hour‚Äôs timeframe. Pluto was here, but my son was distracted by a new friend with bubbles. My son loved handing the pen and autograph book to everyone.¬†

SPECIAL TREATMENT. We picked up first time pins for my wife and son and a birthday pin for me. I got plenty of birthday wishes throughout the trip.

The kind of steady, quiet rain that feels more like a memory than weather. I hadn‚Äôt planned on stopping by the bus stop I told myself I was over it, that it had just been a moment. A perfect, fleeting moment. But as the drops started to fall, my feet knew where to go before my mind caught up.

Same corner. Same cracked sidewalk. Same smell of wet pavement and the distant hiss of tires.

And somehow, after all this time **there she was.**

Red coat. Wild curls. A different book, but the same smile.

She looked up and said, without missing a beat, ‚ÄúStill no umbrella?‚Äù

I smiled back. ‚ÄúStill hoping the rain brings you.‚Äù

We both laughed, and for a second it was like nothing had changed. But this time, **I didn‚Äôt let the moment pass.**

I told her I‚Äôd thought about that day more times than I could count. That I came back to that stop every day for weeks, hoping I‚Äôd see her again. I asked her name.

**Her name is Elise.**

She laughed when I finally asked her out. Said, ‚ÄúTook you long enough.‚Äù

We got coffee rain still falling outside the window, both of us soaked and smiling.

So maybe the rain doesn‚Äôt just bring people back.

‚Äú*Remove and dispose of affected leaves from 
infected plants to keep the fungal spores from spreading into the growing environment. Some growers have reported covering the mature lesions with clear nail polish to prevent the dissemination of spores.

Repeated applications of fungicides such as Dithane M45, Captan, Ferbam, Mancozeb or thiophanate-methylbased treatments will help control infection levels and can prevent new infections in healthy plants, but it is difficult if not impossible to completely eradicate the fungus in an infected host plant.*‚Äù

Has anyone successfully treated this? If I remove the infected leaves, I‚Äôll be cutting back about half the plant, including all new growth and the new pseudobulb. The roots are in a very tight glob, and it seems like it would be impossible to separate out the uninfected parts. Should I spray it with Captain Jack‚Äôs Copper Fungicide and try this clear nail polish technique? I also have a storage problem now because this plant was the centerpiece of my coffee table in my small apartment. Do I need to get rid of it to save my other plants?

After two shoulder injuries, and potential need for a double discectomy, I decided to explore peptides in an attempt to avoid surgery. Started a cycle of BPC/TB at the common 2x per day 250mcg each a few months ago. After the first three weeks added in cjc-1295/Ipamorelin at 1x per day dosage. Total of 9 weeks on cycle.

All seemed well, the shoulder healed up quickly. Pain gone. Workouts were great, no soreness after heavy lifting. Digestion improved drastically (also an issue for me).

What I wasn't expecting (or had even ever heard the word before), was **severe anhedonia.**

I haven't never felt anything like it before, completely flat and empty, no energy, but even more bizarrely no feelings good or bad about life/kids/work/vacation. Caffeine stopped doing anything, I could drink two coffee's back to back and feel nothing. Mood was horrible and both family life and work life began to spiral.

The strangest part was that it took months of this before I started to connect the peptides and this mental state. I had made zero connection between muscle repair and brain chemistry, to my own peril. I had full blood panels done, hormone testing, etc. all was normal.

After diving deep into various threads, and reading more and more experiences like this, I felt like a complete idiot for not researching these risks further.

What I believe to be the common thread across many of these anhedonia events related to BCP-157 is the stacking of peptides and dopaminergic drugs. I take a low dose of biphentin (ADD drug) not every day, just when I feel I need a focus lift. Of course entirely anecdotal, but many of the comments around this include people on either stimulants (ADD) or SSRI type meds.

So a word of caution to those of you out there thinking about healing up a sore arm/shoulder/knee. I may well do that, but come at an extreme cost in other parts of your well being. 

As for now, have been dosing L-Tyrosine daily to rebuild dopamine function which seems to be helping.¬†

Becoming an Oyster - Elizabeth Schneider, Michael Covello (Kutztown, New York)

Becoming an Oyster is an animated short film by Michael Covello and Elizabeth Schneider. It explores the intersection of two significant generational crises: climate change and opioid addiction. Told through the eyes of a young boy, the allegorical narrative touches on themes of consumption, excess, and trauma. The metaphor of an oyster‚Äôs life cycle reflects the vulnerability of human and ecological systems. These filter animals become a two-way mirror through which one may glimpse ecological failure and the consequences of climate disruption as well as the broader struggles and individual trauma of addiction. Becoming an Oyster blends ecological metaphors with human narratives to create a surreal landscape of boyhood adventure, heartbreaking loss, and the legacy we each leave to future generations. 2025; 7 min.

Despite the tender ministrations of Mary (Hilary Bowen-Walsh), the devoted housekeeper, she finds herself unravelling as reality and imagination blur and the paintings in her room come to life to pull her into their surreal narratives. Inspired by ‚ÄúThe Raven‚Äù and other works by Edgar Allan Poe, this powerful and unsettling cinematic journey delves into the depths of the human psyche to explore themes of loss, madness, and the shadowy forces within. 2025; 107 min.

1noni2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1noni2n/i_get_annoyed_at_my_boyfriend_because_he/,I get annoyed at my boyfriend because he constantly says he‚Äôs hungry,"Hi there,

I (27F) keep getting frustrated at my boyfriend (28M) as he says he is constantly hungry? To be specific, even after he eats a whole meal (a large one at that), he still says he is hungry after, almost everytime- that‚Äôs breakfast, lunch and dinner. For context, we eat a full meal for breakfast, lunch and dinner. He always has protein with his meals (more than me) and we eat pretty healthily for the meals. He will also throughout the day make a smoothie on top of this, eat lots of fruit, have 1-2 ice creams, multiple coffees and STILL be hungry. Like, bro ü•µ

Why is this annoying me so much? To me it feels like he needs to be more proactive in how much food he eats, or just eat more and not say he‚Äôs hungry EVERY time. Also does this issue sound normal for him? He says he has always been this way. He is also a thin guy and doesnt gain weight despite how much he eats. He‚Äôs healthy and normal weight and 6ft tall. It‚Äôs my first relationship in a long while so I don‚Äôt know the ways of men anymore and we are a month into our relationship. 

I have asked my boyfriend multiple times about this. As said in the post, he said he‚Äôs always been like this. He‚Äôs also just stopped smoking weed after years on it everyday, and I‚Äôve been through that too so I know the post weed addiction hunger cravings are REAL. So I get that this probably plays a big role in it. For me I‚Äôd say the main issue is that it‚Äôs like this constant complaining of hunger where it‚Äôs like- wtf am I supposed to do about it? You‚Äôre a grown man, sort it out lol. 

It‚Äôs not that he‚Äôs expecting me to get or make him more food. He usually goes and gets himself more- most of the time it‚Äôs something sugary like ice cream or fruit. It really gets me though when I cook for him and make sure to serve him a big amount, and still after eating he says he‚Äôs hungry. I think the issue is that it feels rude and repetitive hearing it after every meal. I‚Äôve asked him kindly to stop saying it so much and to just sort himself out with more food and he got pissed at me, not understanding why I am bothered by it. So I feel bad for being annoyed and I guess am looking for either some validation if it‚Äôs valid to receive, or some roasting/advice on how to be a nicer partner about it.

Thanks, reddit user trying not to be a mean girlfriend ha.

üí≠ What I‚Äôm Looking For
Not here for long-distance‚Äîif we can‚Äôt eventually grab coffee, it won‚Äôt work. I want something that feels natural, someone who‚Äôs creative or at least open-minded, who doesn‚Äôt mind me being real about my ups and downs. Hopefully you like to travel.

üí≠ The Vibe
I‚Äôm a mix of deep talks + random memes, sensitive but funny, introverted but social when it clicks. If you can vibe with my fandoms and don‚Äôt mind a little edge, we‚Äôll get along.

1nondsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1nondsr/dealing_with_non_relationship_break_up_with/,"dealing with ""non relationship break up"" with someone with BPD","Yeah so I met this girl at the gym, initially I was attracted to her & we followed each other on Instagram and got talking right away. Things were good for the first few days where we eventually got the point where we'd meet for a coffee, workout together etc. We had couple little bumps along the way, but nothing major and then we'd got the point where she invited me over to stay at hers after a gym workout so I did, didn't do anything slept on the sofa & went home the next morning.

She then invited me to meet for coffee again which I did, one thing lead to another as we ended up going to the pub & eventually we hooked up. 

I think this night was the first time I'd seen major signs of BPD behaviour as before then I hadn't really seen anything. She'd openly talked to me about it and how it affects her, but I was naive about it as I hadn't really known anyone with it beforehand.

She kicked me out mid sex then texted asking why I left something like that, which eventually lead me going back, which then lead push/pull behaviour with her throwing random tantrums, drinking gin out it's bottle, blatantly choosing to ignoring me with her headphones with being all affectionate in between these episodes.

Twice I looked her in the eyes and, said quite sternly something like ""All the other guys leave you don't they, I'm not going anywhere because I like you & I know you like me too.."" (It certainly felt like it at that point especially as we'd just had such a good day together). Both times she hesitated and didn't really say anything back it could've just been my imagination but, it did feel like she somewhat agreed as she gently nodded (again this could've been my imagination) as she calmed down both times after I said it.

Again I'm not 100% sure if I'm imagining this but I'm sure we did get bit touchy feely after the sex, as we were touching each other as we went to sleep, cuddling & stuff. 

In the morning she was distant as she was on the phone so I stuck around as I wanted to speak to her about her behaviour but, for the approximate 3 hours I was there she was on the phone so eventually gave up & went home.

I eventually got to message her the morning after about how I felt about her behaviour and, she apologised for it and said that was why she didn't normally drink which was understandable.

From there, we were messaging each other for good 2/3 days after and, I felt like it was good, Like I mean I she'd message again after I hadn't replied for a while sort of thing then out of the blue she throws what felt like a bomb saying that she'd been wanting to talk to me, as ""what happened that night shouldn't have happened and, wouldn't have happened if we hadn't been drinking"" how she ""only sees me as a friend there's no attraction there at all, as i'm not her type"" blah blah. So obviously this hurt even though I'd decided I didn't want to pursue a relationship with her, not after how she behaved that night. It was how we'd spent so much time together, opened up to each other etc for her to throw that at me quite bluntly.

I instantly replied something like ""no worries i feel the same"" which was the honest truth and she replied like ""good im glad we can move on from it :)"" when in hindsight I should've communicated better by saying I needed few days to process it. So we didn't speak for few days for her to message me few days later to say she had STI and it was my fault as she was ""clean"" before me. So obviously I was alerted and, went to got myself checked out & was eventually tested negative.. twice. Again in hindsight I feel like I should've communicated better by saying I've taken what she said seriously and, was getting it sorted.

So again we didn't speak for few days, and all of this was swimming on back of my mind especially as she had an event on the Sunday, when I'd said I'd be there to support her when after all of this I couldn't be there to support her - so I felt a bit of sadness & emptiness if I'm honest then she posted on her socials how she was proud of herself for doing the event, especially with the bpd & this got me thinking so I went and researched the BPD bit more, to find several articles saying the best way is to treat it is through therapy so I messaged her congratulating her on the event and, whenever she was up for meeting for a coffee the next morning as I wanted to get out of my chest how I wasn't happy about her ""blaming the STI"" on me and, to suggest whenever she'd considered therapy for the BPD (i honestly meant this with good intentions) & she gave a response that wasn't a no, it was more of sure.. but nothing was confirmed so I said to let me know first thing in the morning. Then I wake up to her posting to her story so I was clearly not her priority so decided to message her what I wanted her to say and, she backlashed with a long horrible message calling me a narcissist etc & how she thought it was best we didn't speak on from now.

Obviously this hurt so I instantly blocked her on both socials I had her on (my friend told me I should've blocked her soon after she said she didn't want to pursue things further but, we're both part of the same community so wanted to give it a chance) then after couple days I decided to unblock her without interacting with her to sort of leave the door open if she wanted to talk it through then I discover she's blocked me on both socials.

TLDR- our rescued dog will not stop marking everywhere, including our bed.

We have a 5ish year old male mini poodle mix we rescued about 8/9 months ago. We adopted him to keep our sweet old rescued pitbull lady company, as our other rescue dog had passed away a couple months prior. I was pregnant when he adopted him- l know, terrible idea to adopt a dog so close to a huge shift in family dynamic, but our pitbull is 10 and we were fearful she would decline of stress and a broken heart. She began eating poop, counter surfing, and howling whenever we left (I've had her 9 years and have never heard her howl once).

Anyway, we got Charlie (12 Ib poodle) unaltered.
The shelter said he was found on the street.
Vets estimated he was around 5. The dogs bonded right away. We noticed when we brought him home he marked. We got him neutered and prioritized potty training and positive reinforcement (e.g. treats after going potty outside). He would occasionally mark here and there, but not too horribly and usually out of separation anxiety when we left. His main concern at the time was resource guarding. This dude had a real Napoleon complex. He loved my husband, hated me. He'd snarl at me, lunge at me, the whole works. Him and I slowly gained trust and he has been better recently, with only a few setbacks. I hand feed him somewhat regularly to reinforce our relationship.
He's loosely kennel-trained, he will go in there for undesirable behavior, or when I give him a choice between wearing a belly band or going in the kennel.

Our son is four months old now, and the last couple weeks of marking has been worse than when he was a newborn. Around our son he is respectfully curious, and regularly gets up with us during late night feeds. But now he‚Äôs peeing on the bed now, our son's stroller, his high chair, our pillows, anything you can think of. We can't let him leave our sights. The other day he tried to mark on our coffee table right in front of me. We is the sweetest when he wants to be. We love him and we have always thought when you adopt a dog, it's for life, but we are at our wits end. As of today, he is in the kennel at night and wears a belly band when he is inside. We know this is a bandaid. We are taking him in to the vet to rule out health issues. We cannot afford a trainer at this point.

The first pour and second were heavier for acidity and sweetness and the last short for less body (washed Ethiopian) but also I under dosed a gram thinking that might help. Well it wasn't bad but I did notice a grainy flavor that I usually don't get and remember from the days of wetting them. I'm not trying to bother anyone or upset them but I truly believe there is a cleaner flavor from not wetting the filter. Just my opinion. I was wondering if anyone else has had this experience or has anyone had the opposite but also tried not wetting the filter? That would be helpful.

Shade when it‚Äôs too hot. Shelter when it rains. A dry spot for morning coffee or a late-night hangout. Honestly, it changes how you use the backyard.

But here‚Äôs what I noticed. Not all patio covers are equal. DIY looks easy at first‚Äîuntil the first storm rolls in and the thing wobbles. That‚Äôs when pro installation makes sense. They deal with stuff most of us wouldn‚Äôt even think about‚Äîdrainage, structural strength, fastening it so it doesn‚Äôt rip apart in heavy wind. Basically, it lasts.

Materials? Big difference. Wood is beautiful, timeless. But it‚Äôs needy‚Äîbugs, rot, the usual headaches. Aluminum is tough, clean, no real maintenance. Vinyl or polycarbonate‚Äîcheap(er) and practical, though not as fancy. And insulated covers? Those are next-level. Cooler in summer. Warmer in winter. A legit year-round upgrade.

The design part surprised me too. Your cover should look like it belongs with the house. Roof pitch, finish, how it flows with the yard. Get it wrong and it sticks out like a sore thumb. Too small feels cramped. Too big swallows the space. Ventilation matters too‚Äînobody wants a hot box patio.

Costs? All over. A couple grand for basic setups. Ten grand plus if you want custom, insulated, with retractable louvers and lighting. Pricey, yeah. But people swear it adds real value. And comfort. Which is kinda the point.

So I‚Äôm curious‚Äîanyone here actually installed one? Wood, aluminum, vinyl‚Äîwhatever. Did it feel worth the cost once you started using it, or nah?",1,1758647451.0,ContractorCorner1,0,1.0,False

This happened a few weeks ago, but all the rapture talk going around reminded me of it and I felt like I should share.

I deconverted almost a decade ago, but haven't had the heart to tell my family. They're not super into enforcing any specific doctrine and they believe and practice their christian faith in different ways. Me not being super enthusiastic about sharing the good word or not going to church isn't questioned. It's easy enough to skate by and just let them believe I'm a bit luke-warm.

I live with my very religious mother in a tiny one-bed-one-bath garden flat. She has some health issues so I try to keep an eye on her. I don't want to bore you with the specifics of our sleeping arrangements, but for the purpose of this story it is important to note that I have easier access to the single shared bathroom. 

She likes her morning coffee, and we have one of those stove kettles with the whistle. We try to conserve the gas as much as possible since refills are expensive, so imagine my surprise when I come out of the restroom one morning and hear the thing screeching to high heaven (pun intended) and not stopping.

Its unlike my mother to leave it unattended so my first reaction is panic that she might have fallen over. I was relieved that she wasn't in the kitchen and just turned the stove burner off, but then she also wasn't in her bed, or at her desk, or anywhere else in the flat. 

And for the life of me, I can not explain why, but I thought I had missed the rapture...

I can't say I was terribly upset at having missed it, but then I realized I was being stupid and my mother was just missing, but I couldn't figure out another logical reason for where on earth she could be. The panic combined with mental-malfunction and short-circuiting is not an experience I'd recommend. 

She came walking up behind me while I was out in the garden, hysterically screaming for my Mamma. Turns out she just couldn't wait for me to get out of the bathroom and decided to use the guest toilet outside - which I had forgotten existed up until this point. 

Almost ten fucking years... And it still got me...

Big thanks to everybody who has supported us since we released our launch video! I have really enjoyed reading all of the feedback and supportive comments.  
  
We will be releasing our technical breakdown soon, I just need to take the time to record it. We have received a lot of community support, in addition to a lot of feedback that we are taking into account and creating action items for.   
  
4 of the biggest *hardware* concerns we have received to date are:

* Ergonomics, The current model is approximately the same size as my Pixel 6 phone, and a bit thicker. I liked the design of the Himera G1 pro, so the current radio with the default battery pack is very similar in size to that. People are concerned about how it feels in your hand, along with table stability because of the relative thinness @ \~21mm. I will be revisiting the mechanical design, nothing is set in stone at this point. 
* GPS. There is currently no GPS on the radio as designed primarily due to cost reasons (planned for inclusion on radio modules). Due to popular demand I will be looking into including it on the mainboard by default.
* Batteries. I designed this radio to have removeable battery packs because I saw this as a requirement for a modern radio. A lot of people (especially internationally) requested a way to swap individual 18650 cells, and I got several comments wanting a built in battery. The built in battery will be by far the easiest to implement, I could even include a user serviceable 7.4V 14500 battery pack that would require removing some screws to change. It would be easy to adapt the current design and likely drive the cost down not having to design/maintain/ship a separate battery pack With the built in battery, I  might be able to weather proof the enclosure easier. Another option is to design it like a TV remote, battery compartment in the back with a cell holder (18650, 18500 or 14500) and the user can open the cover and change individual cells. Please feel free to reach out with feedback on this 
* IP67/68 Rating. After trying to design this while remaining compact, I have decided that this it a lower-priority for this product. I worry that it will drive up cost and development time too much. Due to the open source nature however, We want to empower the community to design aftermarket cases and other accessories to address those who need this feature. We *may* try to seal the enclosure better if we go with a built in battery, but this is not a promise.

Please comment/reach out if you have feedback on the battery issue (or anything else). To summarize the options from easiest/cheapest to hardest:

* Build in, serviceable/replacable battery (by far easiest/cheapest for us, could make weatherproofing easier). 
* TV remote style cell replacement (very user friendly, slightly harder to manufacture, potential safety issue if mismatched cells are installed).
* Hot-swappable, clip on battery packs (As currently designed. Most expensive option as we will have to maintain effectively a second product).",3,1758647064.0,HamRadio,0,1.0,False

I cannot for the life of me kind any penny sleeves or toploaders that these would fit in to keep them safely protected. They measure 3 inches across, which I assume is the problem. I did find some larger toploaders that are about 3 11/16 x 5 1/4, so they would fit in those, but I would still prefer a penny sleeves too.

Has anyone ever come across something that might work for these? Or maybe even see some out in the wild in some kind of protective casing?

Hey there,

I‚Äôm looking to connect with someone genuine who enjoys good conversation, laughter, and building a real connection. Friendship is always the starting point, but I‚Äôm open to seeing where things can naturally go whether that‚Äôs just good company, something casual, or eventually more.

A little about me: I‚Äôm 33, 5‚Äô10‚Äù, athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. People would describe me as laid back, sarcastic in the best way, and always down to laugh. My work keeps me busy with odd hours, but I actually enjoy the flexibility it gives me. I can travel and usually work around different schedules pretty easily.

When it comes to interests, I‚Äôm all about the outdoors during spring, summer, and fall whether that‚Äôs hiking, camping, being out on the water, or just a long walk with good company. In the colder months I switch gears and keep it cozy with reading, cooking, binging shows, or relaxing with coffee and good conversation. I also really value physical connection and quality time. It‚Äôs my way of feeling close to someone.

I‚Äôm hoping to meet someone who‚Äôs fun, witty, playful, and open minded. Consistency matters to me, and I‚Äôd love to find someone who enjoys both the silly side of things and the deeper conversations. Someone who‚Äôs not afraid of a little sarcasm, loves to laugh, and appreciates genuine connections.

If this sounds like your vibe, send me a message. I‚Äôd be glad to get to know you.

Back in Mimico, I could walk to almost everything. Grabbing a coffee, picking up groceries, or heading down to the lake all felt easy and part of everyday life. The neighbourhood had that mix of green space, shops, and transit that made it feel connected. It was easy to see your neighbours, bump into people, and it had more of a community vibe. People were just friendly. 

Here in Vaughan it feels really different. Everything is so spread out that even simple errands are such a chore, getting in the car, and traffic everywhere. The parks here are nice, but trails are hard to get to.

Is there a Main Street where you can just wander and stumble onto things to do?? I actually can‚Äôt find a cool Main Street vibe!! Looking for recommendations if you have.

I do think Vaughan has a lot of potential. I wish it‚Äôs more walkable and community-focused. I‚Äôd love to see safer streets for walking, more places where shops and homes are closer together, and green spaces that are easier to access. It would make a huge difference if the city also put more energy into community events that actually bring people together.

Curious what longtime residents think ,do you feel the same way, or is it just me noticing this as someone coming from a more walkable more urban environment?

Or even little ones. I used to sometimes get the warm feeling when listening to hymns, but later in high school when I discovered hozier, I got the same feeling from his music. So I'm pretty sure that was not the holy ghost lol

But I remember being 12 and going to the temple for the first time. It was a 2.5 hour drive and my dad spent the whole time telling me how wonderful it was going to be and the amazing experiences I'd have inside the temple. And we got there and we were sitting in the waiting room. And all I could think about were the golden tissue boxes. Their tissue boxes were hidden under these gold metal boxes. I remember staring at these boxes and thinking, ""why?"" Why is that necessary? How does a golden tissue box make this place more spiritual or holy? Needless to say, I did not have any kind of spiritual experience and I was very stuck on the golden tissue boxes. 

Or like, I'd read the book of mormon and pray about it and just never received that confirmation that it was true. I had a lot of issues with my parents after telling them I didn't want to go to church anymore in high school, so I really tried hard to believe after that and it just never happened. In fact, one time, I went and grabbed one of the missionary book of Mormons off the bookcase and tried to start from the beginning without all the little notes and highlights to distract me from when I was a kid. And I didn't even make it past the first page because Lehi was this great prophet from Jerusalem and he's never mentioned in the Bible. Based on the timeline, if he was actually a great prophet, he would be somewhere in the old testament. And he wasn't. And that also bothered me and I gave up lol (maybe thats not actually true, I'm not a historian, but from what I could find at the time, the beginning of the book of mormon took place before the end of the old testament).

Sometimes it bothered me that I didn't feel the holy ghost confirm things to me and I'd feel like maybe there's something wrong with me. But other times I'd be sitting in the pews and thinking ""you guys actually believe this?"" 

So anyway, anybody else just never have any spiritual experiences even though you wanted to have them?

I need you to know that I wanted to stay. 

I tried to understand. I tried to make sense of the constant push/pull. The hurtful comments in the most vulnerable of moments. The distance. The silence. 

I've learned it's not really about me. And that makes me sad. Because I could fix it if it was. But I can't fix you. I just wanted to love you. But loving you hurts. 

Maybe it's because you're convinced that you aren't worthy of being truly loved for who you are. 

Or maybe you're too afraid of being truly seen. Messy and human and flawed. 

I need you to know that I loved you anyways. 

Even with your avoidant tendencies. The self deprecation and insecurities. The relentless critic that lives in your head. Even your ridiculously runny nose. 

I need you to know that I love you still. But loving you does me little good. All it does is widen this chasm inside of my chest. 

But still I wait for someone who will talk himself out of showing up 100% of the time. 

I know I need to let go. I know I need to move on. But I want it to be you. I've wanted it to be you since our first awkward glances over coffee. 

I imagine you are happier since I left. Despite the way it stings - I hope that you are. I hope you find peace in yourself. I hope you find love that lasts. Love that's true. Even if you were reckless with my heart - I hope that for you. And I guess that's how I know I love you still. 

I hope you heal. And I hope you come back when you do. If not in this lifetime, maybe the next. In the meantime, give Betty scritches for me.

[Original Post](https://www.askamanager.org/2023/07/a-thought-experiment-is-causing-a-cold-war-in-my-office.html)  **July 10, 2023**

I work in an office of ~20 people. The majority of us have lunch together in the conference room most days. It‚Äôs not organized or mandatory, just a preference for most of us. People drift in and out and sometimes skip if they have errands or out-of-office meetings that day. The only person who consistently does not join in is Carrie. She has a chilly personality, but she‚Äôs not rude or outright unfriendly, just keeps to herself for the most part if something isn‚Äôt work-related. That‚Äôs fine! She attends holiday parties or any outside work event our bosses organize.

However, one day a month or so ago, our IT contractor came in to update software, and Carrie did come into the conference room for lunch because the contractor was working at her desk at that time. She was quiet except for greeting everyone, which is normal, until another coworker, Steve, brought up one of his ‚Äúthought experiments,‚Äù which is a common lunchtime bit he does, although not every day. He proposes the questions to the group at large ‚Äî along the lines of the¬†[immortality pill](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/finding-meaning-in-imperfect-world/201905/do-you-really-want-live-forever)¬†or¬†[Mary‚Äôs room](https://medium.com/psy-lens/marys-room-thought-experiment-a01d8f4cadb3)¬†(concepts I wasn‚Äôt familiar with myself until they came up in these conversations). This time, his question was essentially, ‚ÄúIf you had to choose between the death of one person you‚Äôve never met or the destruction of all the works of Shakespeare (or another author you prefer), what would your choice be?‚Äù

Everyone was being flippant for the most part (i.e., ‚ÄúIf I save the person, no kid will be forced to read Shakespeare ever again!‚Äù) until Carrie chimed in and said, ‚ÄúShakespeare teaches us more about humanity that saving one life would, so I would save the plays.‚Äù This created a very awkward silence and made several people visibly uncomfortable. Personally, I thought it was a theoretical discussion (and was scrolling on my phone anyway) so didn‚Äôt take it too seriously. Steve seemed to feel the same at the time and debated with her a bit, but no one else said anything related to it for the rest of lunch and most everyone excused themselves quickly. I thought it was awkward but just one of those things that would blow over.

‚Ä¶which it didn‚Äôt. People started avoiding Carrie or being very curt with her almost immediately (like, that very afternoon). It‚Äôs not really the vibe in our office to email each other since we‚Äôre so small, but most everyone started emailing her when normally they would just approach her or speak to her over her cubicle wall. I honestly can‚Äôt tell if Carrie even minds the different treatment, but it‚Äôs so pointed I have to think she‚Äôs noticed.

The next day at lunch, Steve expressed relief the IT update was over so Carrie would stay away. Many chimed in with their agreement. Unfortunately, every day at lunch since at least one person will bring up Carrie‚Äôs response to the question and how freaked out they were by it and that will prompt a prolonged discussion about the weirdness and how people don‚Äôt want to be around her and how she‚Äôs always been ‚Äúoff.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt really know what to do! It seems so silly, but people are not backing down on avoiding Carrie or talking about how strange she is, when they never seemed to feel that way before. Our bosses are both about 10 years older than most of us (a couple in their 40s; most staff are late 20s/30s) and I feel like if I bring this up they‚Äôll see the whole thing as childish and gossipy, and particularly judge anyone who brings it up to them. We don‚Äôt have HR.

For my part, I‚Äôve tried to continue to approach Carrie the same way I did before. She hasn‚Äôt complained herself, so maybe I‚Äôm just making something out of nothing and she‚Äôs fine with the cost of one remark she made! Is there something I should say to my coworkers, or should I just hope they move on soon?

[Update 1](https://www.askamanager.org/2023/07/update-a-thought-experiment-is-causing-a-cold-war-in-my-office.html)  **July 24, 2023 (2 weeks later)**

Thank you for answering my question. I want to update you, because even though it was difficult, after reflection I did see your point about previous disinclination toward Carrie before the thought experiment conversation. At first I was very resistant to that idea but I tried to be objective in thinking about it. I‚Äôm an introvert myself even though I enjoy group lunches and am friends with several of my coworkers, so I didn‚Äôt really think anything of Carrie not being the most sociable person in the office, but I do think it bothered some of my coworkers on some level.

When Carrie started about a year ago, several people invited her to join us at lunch or for after-work dinner or drinks, and she always declined. The invitations naturally stopped after a while but there wasn‚Äôt much commentary about it. I didn‚Äôt think much about it except that Carrie‚Äôs personality/work style is more aligned with our bosses‚Äô than anyone else in the office. They are very much ‚Äúno fuss, lunch at their desks, do the job and leave it there‚Äù people. (There is no cause or opportunity for taking work home physically here, and very little overtime, so I mean Carrie is similar to them in terms of not socializing much with coworkers during the workday or after.) After I read your answer, I considered that maybe some people saw Carrie as deliberately trying to emulate that style rather than it just being her personality. Like maybe people saw her as trying to stand out from the crowd and carry herself as more of a manager than a peer? I never saw it that way but this is my best guess as far as why people were so quick to turn on her after the Shakespeare conversation.

I have to admit it was hard to read such a harsh view of Steve in the comments, when I know he isn‚Äôt the person he may have seemed like from the events stemming from this conversation. I was so upset in part because he was the first to publicly, vocally disparage Carrie for her answer the day after the initial conversation. He is normally a thoughtful, fair, kind person, so it was out of character. I did feel his comment was the catalyst for the discussions at lunch that followed, even if other co-workers had already started to treat Carrie differently without his input. I just want to make it clear that Steve did not encourage anyone to immediately start being cold to Carrie, or indeed at all. He never said anything like that. He is an unofficial leader in our office, so it‚Äôs possible he had the bigger obligation to not comment on her answer after the conversation was over, but he isn‚Äôt a bully or a ‚Äúdevil‚Äôs advocate‚Äù guy. I realize I may be coming off as very defensive here but I just feel protective of him after reading the comments. I had spoken to him about this once after his comment the day after the Shakespeare conversation, and told him he seemed okay with Carrie‚Äôs response in the moment and it seemed harsh to criticize it after the fact. He immediately said his comment about being glad the IT update was over so Carrie could entertain herself at lunch was meant as a lighthearted joke and was clearly a poor one since I took it badly, and that was on him.

The day after I read your response I thought really discussing the situation with Steve would be a good start. We usually walk from the office to our cars together so I asked him if he thought the continued focus on Carrie‚Äôs answer to the thought experiment was strange or mean. He said he did think it was weird it kept coming up but that he hadn‚Äôt really noticed anyone treating Carrie differently. He is one of only two people in the office besides our bosses that has an office rather than a cubicle, so he hasn‚Äôt been physically present for much of the cold shouldering. I told him about the general coldness people have been treating her with and he said that wasn‚Äôt okay and if I‚Äôd like to address it the next time it came up he‚Äôd back me up.

The next day when someone inevitably mentioned Carrie, I said ‚ÄúHey, I actually think Carrie is just kind of quiet and it might‚Äôve been hard for her to join in the discussion. It was hypothetical so she took it that way. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a big deal forever.‚Äù Steve nodded and said ‚ÄúJane‚Äôs (me) right, and I really don‚Äôt want her to be uncomfortable! Let‚Äôs knock it off.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt happy with the implication that my being uncomfortable was a better reason to stop the behavior than because it was cruel to Carrie, but it was better than nothing. The only pushback was from another coworker who said ‚ÄúCarrie took that WAY too seriously. She could‚Äôve read the room‚Äù (a point that has been made ad nauseam in the month since). Steve responded that the discussion could have been serious or not; Carrie‚Äôs interpretation was valid. Everyone kind of shrugged and moved on.

The only other negative talk I have overheard since are a couple of uses of an extremely stupid nickname a small number of coworkers had started using for Carrie, ‚Äúthe robot.‚Äù The first time I heard it after asking the Carrie bashing to stop I just said, ‚ÄúGuys, really?‚Äù and things moved on. The next time, one coworker said ‚ÄúDoes the robot never check her email? I needed something from her like two hours ago.‚Äù I responded, ‚ÄúIf you mean *Carrie*, why don‚Äôt you walk over and just talk to her?‚Äù I haven‚Äôt heard anything personally since.

My relationship with Carrie is the same as it has always been. I do and will continue to try to make a point to stop by her desk now and then to ask how her weekend was or if she‚Äôd like something if I‚Äôm going on a coffee run. Steve makes a point of leaving his office to approach her in person if he needs something from her (which to be fair isn‚Äôt often in his role, but he never changed his approach to her like others did). Yesterday one of our bosses spent about an hour at Carrie‚Äôs desk working on something with her and from what I overheard (small office! I wasn‚Äôt intentionally eavesdropping) it was a very friendly conversation, with the two of them chuckling often and joking a bit about a new and laborious process the new software entails. I think that, more than anything, will help things get back to normal.

Thank you again for your thoughtful response.

**NEW UPDATE**

[Update 2](https://www.askamanager.org/2023/12/update-a-thought-experiment-is-causing-a-cold-war-in-my-office-2.html)  **Dec 18, 2023 (5 months later)**

I saw it‚Äôs update season, so I thought I‚Äôd do so one more time. Things have gotten a lot better since that original update I sent in. The major ringleader of the ‚ÄúCarrie is weird/robotic‚Äù discourse was let go in September. I didn‚Äôt know why at first, but Steve confided in me that he mentioned to one of our bosses in a private chat that that person really had a toxic effect on the workplace (in addition to just not being great at her job). I imagine it was a combination of those things that led to the termination. Her closest friends became much quieter generally almost immediately, perhaps hoping to avoid being perceived the same way. For all I know, our bosses reprimanded them. I do want to say I believe the ‚Äúrobot‚Äù nickname started because that little group felt her answer to the Shakespeare question was cold/inhumane. It wasn‚Äôt anything to do with her affect. Not that that makes it better, but I saw some commenters feeling worried about their own manner of speaking/interacting with people and how that could target them for that kind of name calling (and those who had actually been targeted). I just wanted to clarify, and say be yourself even if you feel like you sound less than enthused/gregarious at work if it‚Äôs safe/otherwise professional for you to do so. Horrible people will be horrible regardless, so there‚Äôs no reason to police yourself that way.

Carrie is actually on her honeymoon leave right now. We gave her a work shower right before her wedding, as we would for anyone else here for a wedding or baby (not a big production, just a sheet cake and group gift from her registry). I was a bit nervous about it, to be honest, because I wanted it to be nice for her but I knew that a few people in attendance would be the ones who‚Äôd talked about her behind her back earlier in the year and I just thought the hypocrisy would be awkward. It wasn‚Äôt, though, really ‚Äî those folks had already been acting chastised after the other coworker‚Äôs termination, so they were once again quiet and mild. Our bosses attended Carrie‚Äôs wedding and they said it was lovely.

I will say that in my view there was a LOT of projection in the comments based on identifying with Carrie. I‚Äôm not trying to diminish anyone‚Äôs personal experiences with feeling ostracized at work or in other social settings for any reason, but respectfully, none of the commenters really know anything about her or any of the rest of us. She is a nice, serious, quiet person and no one ever deserves to be talked about like that behind their back for just being a bit outside office culture (or for any reason I can think of barring actual criminal behavior!). But the idea that some commenters were fantasizing about Carrie being promoted to manager and then immediately firing the rest of us was so bizarre to me as the person who knows her and our workplace. However, I accept that I could not possibly include every piece of context that seemed relevant to me to head off that type of comment, and even if I sent in an entire novel (instead of a novella, haha) and you were willing to publish it, some people would read into it what they wanted to and there‚Äôs nothing I can do about that. I lost control of the narrative when I wrote in, which I felt I was prepared for, but maybe not as much as I thought.

Thank you again for your original response. I am still grateful you urged me to consider this wasn‚Äôt really about the thought experiment at all. I couldn‚Äôt see beyond that one event because it loomed so large in my mind at the time. And truly, thank you to those commenters who engaged with my situation the same way and shared their stories of feeling alienated for any reason, especially if they‚Äôre neurodivergent. I didn‚Äôt think it was healthy for me to try to respond in real time but I read them all.

1nomfsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForbiddenFrequency404/comments/1nomfsh/the_creepiest_night_in_my_life_in_detroit/,The creepiest night in my life in Detroit,"I never thought I‚Äôd be the kind of man who aims his rifle scope at another living person.  
But boredom has a way of twisting your routines into something you‚Äôd rather not admit out loud.

I‚Äôd rented this apartment in Detroit, East Side. Cheap place, temporary deal‚Äîthree months tops, just to be close to a contracting job. It was one of those tall, worn-down complexes: brown brick, peeling paint, neighbors arguing in the hallways. The rent was low because the landlord knew no one sane wanted to stay here longer than necessary. And me? I didn‚Äôt care. I wasn‚Äôt planning on putting down roots.

Evenings were the problem. Work was boring, sure, but at least it kept my hands busy. Back home, I had nothing. No cable‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt about to waste money on that. Mobile data was enough, and signing a long-term internet contract didn‚Äôt make sense when I knew I‚Äôd be gone before the ink dried. I had a couple books, but I burned through those in the first week. That left me with long nights, a thin mattress, and silence thick enough to choke on.

So I turned to the only hobby I‚Äôd brought with me: my Remington 700. Bought it second-hand at a gun show a few years back. Cleaned it up myself, fitted it with a decent scope. Nothing fancy, just a reliable bolt-action rifle. I‚Äôd never fired it at anything living, and I didn‚Äôt plan to. But I liked the weight of it, the precision. Looking through the glass made me feel steady, like the world narrowed into a clean circle where everything was sharp and in focus.

At first, it was innocent. I‚Äôd set it on the table by the window, draw the curtains just enough to leave a slit, and line up the scope with rooftops and street signs. Ranging distances, testing how steady my hand was after coffee, after a long day, after two beers. Just practice.

Then, one night, I slid the crosshairs across the building opposite mine. Another twelve-story complex, maybe two hundred yards away. A whole wall of glowing rectangles, each window a little TV screen playing a different channel. And once I started, I couldn‚Äôt stop.

The first night hooked me right away. Dozens of glowing windows across the street, each one a private stage I wasn‚Äôt supposed to see. People arguing, eating, laughing, living. I told myself it was just curiosity, just something to pass the time. But the truth is, it felt wrong‚Äîand that was part of the pull. The fact that they couldn‚Äôt see me, while I could see everything, gave me a rush that was half excitement, half guilt. Like I‚Äôd crossed into a place I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be, and found it too fascinating to leave.

It‚Äôs funny how boredom makes you cross lines you swore you‚Äôd never cross.  
Loneliness teaches you habits you‚Äôd never admit in daylight.

Over the next few nights, the habit stuck. I‚Äôd come home, heat up some leftovers, maybe drink a beer, then pull the curtains just enough and lean into the scope. The apartment complex across the street turned into my private theater. Dozens of shows, none of them knowing they had an audience.

Most people would probably call it sick. And maybe it was. But for me, it was survival. Better to be the watcher than the man alone in the dark with nothing but his thoughts.

When you stare into other people‚Äôs lives long enough, you realize how predictable we all are. Most windows replay the same story, night after night.  
But every now and then, something new slips through the cracks.

It was on the eighth night that I noticed him.

A window on the eighth floor. At first glance, nothing unusual‚Äîjust a dim, bare room with yellowing wallpaper and a single bed pushed into the corner. A naked bulb dangled from the ceiling. The rest was empty: a couple chairs stacked in the corner, a rug that had seen better decades. The kind of space you‚Äôd expect in a building like this‚Äîcheap, forgotten, temporary.

But the figure on the bed was what stopped me.

He was sitting cross-legged, back straight, facing the wall. His head was completely bald, skin pale under the light. He was shirtless, skinny to the point of wrong‚Äîhis spine curved under the skin like a row of knots pulled too tight. His arms dangled long at his sides, fingertips brushing his knees. He didn‚Äôt move. Not once.

I held my breath, watching him. Maybe he was meditating. Maybe asleep sitting up. Maybe dead. Hell, maybe it wasn‚Äôt even a person‚Äîmaybe a mannequin someone left behind. I tried to convince myself of all those things, but none of them stuck. Something about him made the hair rise on the back of my neck.

I swept the scope across the wall he was staring at. Nothing there. No posters, no pictures, not even cracks that might hold his attention. Just peeling wallpaper, water stains, the color of old teeth. I shifted back to him. Still motionless. Still staring.

Most people move, even if just to scratch their nose.  
But that night, he didn‚Äôt. And I knew I‚Äôd be back at the window tomorrow.

The eighth-night discovery should have scared me off. Any reasonable man would have looked at that pale figure in the bare room, muttered something about ‚Äúnot my business,‚Äù and turned away.  
But the truth? It made me hungrier.

Soon, watching the building across the street wasn‚Äôt just a way to kill time‚Äîit was my ritual. Every evening after work, I‚Äôd heat up something cheap, crack open a beer, and settle into my spot at the window. Curtains drawn just enough, scope angled across the gap, my eye drinking in those glowing rectangles.

I had plenty of windows to choose from, but a few became my favorites.

There was the single mom with two kids. Her boys treated the living room like a trampoline park, bouncing off the couch while she dragged herself in after work. Sometimes she‚Äôd yell, sometimes she‚Äôd laugh, sometimes she just sank into the sofa with a bottle of cheap wine and stared through the TV like she was miles away. I didn‚Äôt pity her‚ÄîI respected her. She kept going, even when it was obvious she had nothing left in the tank.

Then there was the young couple. They were relentless, like they‚Äôd made a bet with themselves to see how many ways two people could wear each other out before sunrise. At first, it was entertaining‚Äîlike stumbling across a pay-per-view show for free‚Äîbut eventually it was just predictable. Still, I kept watching. Predictability can be comforting.

And then the gymnast girl. Twelve, maybe thirteen. Every night she stretched, jumped rope, practiced handstands in her tiny living room. Always in that faded leotard, hair pulled tight. No distractions, no breaks, just pure repetition. Watching her was like seeing focus distilled into a kid‚Äôs body. She reminded me that discipline was possible‚Äîeven in a place where everything else seemed to fall apart.

I never told myself they were ‚Äúneighbors.‚Äù Neighbors are people you wave to in the hallway. These weren‚Äôt people I knew; they were characters in a show only I could watch. And each of them pulled me deeper into the habit.

But the bald man‚Äîhe wasn‚Äôt just another character. He was a puzzle. And puzzles have a way of eating at you if you leave them unsolved.

A week passed. Every night, the same scene: him sitting cross-legged on the bed, motionless, eyes fixed on the wall. Sometimes the sheets on the bed looked slightly different, as if someone had changed them while I wasn‚Äôt looking. But him? He never moved.

One night, after two beers, I decided to break the script. I wanted to see if I could force something to happen.

I pulled up my phone and ordered a pizza. Large pepperoni, extra cheese. Delivery to apartment 8B‚Äîthe bald man‚Äôs floor, his window. My hands were sweating as I typed in the address. I told myself it was harmless. If he was a normal guy, he‚Äôd answer the door, pay, and eat. And I‚Äôd finally know.

Half an hour later, I spotted the delivery car pulling up to the curb. My heart thudded in my chest as the driver walked inside with the box balanced on his arm. I tightened the scope on 8B‚Äôs window, waiting for movement. Any movement.

Five minutes passed. Ten. Then, out of the corner of the scope, I caught the driver coming back out the front doors of the building.

He wasn‚Äôt carrying the pizza anymore.

Instead, he had the box open in one hand, munching on a slice, earbuds in, nodding his head to whatever he was listening to. By the time he reached his car, he was whistling, chewing happily, like nothing strange had happened at all.

I sat back, cold all over. Where had the pizza gone? Why hadn‚Äôt he taken money? Why hadn‚Äôt anyone answered? Did he just‚Ä¶ keep it for himself? Or had he gone up there, knocked, and walked away with the box untouched?

I wanted to believe the driver was just lazy, that he figured no one was home and he might as well eat it himself. But that explanation didn‚Äôt stick. Something had happened in there‚Äîsomething I couldn‚Äôt see.

That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I lay awake with the rifle beside me, scope pointed at the window, curtains cracked just enough for me to keep watch. He was still there, sitting in the same position, like nothing had changed.

Most people, I reminded myself, live entire lives without ever being noticed. But once you notice someone like that, you can‚Äôt stop.

And the worst part?  
I was starting to feel like he‚Äôd noticed me back.

The pizza stunt should have been my wake-up call. A normal person would‚Äôve felt embarrassed, maybe laughed it off as a dumb idea, and moved on. But I wasn‚Äôt normal anymore. By then, watching that window wasn‚Äôt just a habit‚Äîit was an obsession.

Every night I found myself glued to the scope, waiting for the slightest twitch of movement. Nothing ever came. The mom yelled at her kids, the couple broke their own records, the gymnast girl trained until her arms shook. Life went on in all the other windows. But in 8B, nothing changed. A pale body sitting cross-legged, staring at the wall.

And the more nothing happened, the more it burned me alive.

I started timing how long I could keep my eye in the scope without blinking. Sometimes I sat so long I forgot to eat. Sometimes I went to bed dizzy, with black rings floating in my vision. But I kept watching.

That‚Äôs when I noticed the woman.

It was a weekday afternoon‚ÄîI‚Äôd left work early. Through the scope, I saw her slip into the room. Mid-thirties, maybe older, dark hair pulled back, moving carefully, like a nurse on rounds. She carried a tray: a small vial, a couple of boxes. She set it down on the bed beside him. Then she leaned close, pressed something against his arm. I couldn‚Äôt see clearly from my angle, but it looked like an injection. He never flinched.

When she finished, she crossed the room to the window. Instead of turning her back on him, she shuffled sideways, her face always angled toward the figure on the bed. She cracked the window, lit a cigarette, and smoked it down to the filter. Then she stubbed it out, closed the window, gathered the tray, and backed out the door‚Äînever once turning away from him.

I told myself she was a caretaker, maybe hired to look after a relative. But something about the way she moved chilled me. The way she never let him out of her sight, like she was afraid he‚Äôd pounce if she turned around.

For the next few nights, I tracked her routine. Every other day, almost to the hour, she entered with her tray, gave him the injection, smoked her cigarette, and left. Always backing out. Always keeping her eyes locked on him.

It gnawed at me until I couldn‚Äôt stand it anymore. Watching wasn‚Äôt enough. I needed to know what was happening inside that room.

So one Friday night, when I saw her leave the building with a shopping bag, I grabbed my jacket and headed across the street.

The building‚Äôs hallway smelled of dust and old cigarettes. Fluorescent lights flickered overhead, buzzing like dying insects. I climbed to the eighth floor, every step heavier than the last.

The corridor stretched out in front of me, lined with dented doors. At the far end, junk was piled high: broken furniture, boxes, a bicycle frame, a rusted wheelchair tipped against the wall. And in that cluttered corner sat the door I‚Äôd been staring at for weeks‚ÄîApartment 8B.

I stood there, heart pounding, palms sweating. What the hell was I doing? Breaking into a stranger‚Äôs apartment? Looking for what, exactly?

I told myself I‚Äôd just listen at the door, maybe confirm he was even real. But then, beneath the thud of my heartbeat, I heard it.

A sound.

‚ÄúShhhwaaaark‚Ä¶ shhhwaaaark‚Ä¶‚Äù

Slow, dragging footsteps. Getting closer.

I froze. The noise stopped right behind the door.

And then the handle began to rattle.

Not just a twist‚Äîviolent jerks, like someone was yanking it back and forth, trying to tear it off. The door groaned under sudden pressure, hinges squealing as if something heavy leaned against it from the other side.

My blood turned to ice.

Through the thin wood, I heard it: breathing. Wet, ragged, wheezing like air being forced through a crushed windpipe. Each inhale whistled, each exhale hissed, closer than I‚Äôd ever wanted it to be.

The handle kept thrashing. The frame shook. For one terrible second, I was sure it would burst open.

That broke me.

I bolted. Down the hallway, down the stairs, feet barely touching the steps. I don‚Äôt even remember crossing the lobby. All I know is I hit the cold night air like a drowning man breaking the surface.

By the time I circled the block and made it back to my own apartment, my lungs were on fire. I slammed the door, locked it, and stumbled to my window. My rifle was waiting, scope already aimed across the gap.

I pressed my eye to the glass‚Äî

And there he was.

Not cross-legged anymore. Not facing the wall.

He was standing at the window, hands spread against the glass, pale fingers scraping downward with a squeal I swore I could hear from across the street. His enormous head tilted forward, and in the glow of that naked bulb, I saw his face for the first time.

No nose, no lips. Just two cavernous pits sinking too deep into his skull, eyes that weren‚Äôt eyes at all but endless dark holes, as if they could swallow the light from my scope. And yet‚Äîat the very bottom of that darkness, something moved. A shimmer, a twitch, like a pupil shifting in a place where no eye should be. His mouth gaped open and closed, smearing spit across the glass, fingers scraping with nails too long, too sharp.

And the worst part?  
I knew he was staring directly at me.

I don‚Äôt remember pulling away from the scope. One second I was frozen there, staring into those bottomless eyes, and the next I was stumbling backward, knocking over the chair. My hands were moving on their own, reaching for the box of ammo I kept in the closet.

The rifle had always been a comfort to me‚Äîsteel and wood, simple and reliable. But loading it now felt different. My fingers fumbled as I shoved cartridges into the magazine, each metallic click ringing too loud in the silence of the room. I kept telling myself: if he moved, if he tried anything, I‚Äôd put a bullet straight through that window.

By the time I racked the bolt and raised the rifle again, my heart was beating so hard I could feel it in my teeth. I pressed my eye to the glass.

The window across the street was no longer empty. The curtains were drawn tight, swaying slightly as if someone had just pulled them shut. No pale face. No black holes for eyes. Just heavy fabric, rippling in the glow of the ceiling bulb.

I held there, waiting, the crosshairs steady on the center of the window. Sweat slid down my cheek, caught in the corner of my mouth. My finger hovered on the trigger, but there was nothing to fire at.

I stayed like that for what felt like hours. My shoulders ached, my eyes burned, but I couldn‚Äôt lower the rifle. Every second I expected those curtains to twitch, to slide open, to reveal that face pressed against the glass again.

They never did.

When I finally lowered the rifle, the apartment felt colder, emptier than before. Sometimes silence doesn‚Äôt mean safety. Sometimes it only means something dangerous learned how to wait. The moment something breaks its own pattern, you realize you were never the one in control. As if he hadn‚Äôt disappeared, just‚Ä¶ stepped out of view. As if he was still there, inches from the fabric, waiting for me to let my guard down.

And I realized something that made my stomach twist: he‚Äôd never once moved while I was watching. But tonight, he had chosen to.

I moved out the very next morning. No questions, no excuses‚Äîjust cash on the table for the landlord and a half-hearted promise to forward the mail I knew I‚Äôd never see. He didn‚Äôt ask why. Maybe he saw the look on my face and decided he didn‚Äôt want the answer.

The weeks that followed blurred together. New job sites, new temporary housing, different walls to stare at when sleep refused to come. I told myself I‚Äôd left it behind on that street in Detroit, left him behind.

But the truth? He followed me.

Not in the daylight‚Äîno. In the daylight, I can almost convince myself it was nothing, that I imagined the whole thing. But at night, in dreams too sharp to be dreams, I hear it. The frantic rattle of a doorknob, the hinges straining as something leans its weight against my door. That wheezing, broken breath sliding through the cracks.

And every time, I reach for my rifle. I load it, I raise it, I press the trigger‚Äî  
and every time, it jams.

So I clean it. Again and again. I polish the barrel, I oil the bolt, I run patches until the cloth comes out white. I tell myself it won‚Äôt fail me again.

But what bothers me most isn‚Äôt the dreams.  
It‚Äôs the memory of that night‚Äîwhen he saw me.

You can leave a place behind, but not the things that noticed you there.  
A weapon is supposed to give you certainty. But once doubt creeps in, even steel feels fragile.

First real shift came not long after I finished trade school ‚Äî barely had the diesel grease washed off my hands before they stuck me out in the woods with a seventy-ton engine and a guy I‚Äôd never met.

Not much has scared me since that night. But I still don‚Äôt take jobs anywhere near Cold Pines Spur.

I work freight up north ‚Äî real north. Iron Range country, where the wind off Lake Superior‚Äôll cut through denim like razor wire. Our runs mostly service old lumber operations and half-shuttered mills. A lot of it‚Äôs outdated spur lines, the kind nobody upgrades because there‚Äôs not enough freight left to justify the cost. It's cold, it's slow, and it pays by the hour.

I got hired on with Northern Timber & Rail right after I got certified. Started out of a depot near Violet Ridge, Minnesota ‚Äî blink and you miss it, one bar, two gas pumps, and a diner that serves soup out of a coffee machine. I rent a room over a bait shop and live mostly on instant noodles and diner leftovers.

That night ‚Äî the one I keep coming back to ‚Äî was two years ago. January. Middle of a cold snap. One of those nights where your lungs sting just from breathing. The fog was so thick you could chew it.

I was curled up in bed, watching some dusty old detective rerun, when my phone rang.  
Frank Holloway.

My usual engineer.

Sixty-two years old, twice divorced, built like a mini-fridge and just as warm. The guy was a lifer ‚Äî started on steam, stayed for diesel, and outlived three locomotives and most of his hearing.

‚ÄúHey, Frank,‚Äù I answered. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

His voice sounded off. Breathy. Uneven. Like he‚Äôd been pacing or had something stuck in his throat.

‚ÄúJay... I‚Äôm not making the shift tonight. Something came up. Personal.‚Äù

I sat up. ‚ÄúYou alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. Just... not tonight, okay? Talk to dispatch when you get in. They‚Äôll pair you with someone.‚Äù

There was a weird pause.

Then, sharply:  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt half-ass the engine. I want that thing clean enough to eat off when I‚Äôm back.‚Äù

I laughed. ‚ÄúYes, sir. No slacking. Got it. Be safe, alright?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt reply. Just hung up.

Something about the call bugged me. Frank wasn‚Äôt the sentimental type, but his voice had this... off-key edge to it. Like something was crawling under his skin.

I tried not to overthink it.

By 7:30, I was dressed, packed, and headed into the whiteout. The fog had thickened to the point I couldn‚Äôt see the end of my street. Everything was muffled ‚Äî like the snow was absorbing sound. Even my boots sounded too quiet.

When I checked in at dispatch, they paired me with a guy I‚Äôd never worked with before: Rob Talbot, 26, fresh out of the company‚Äôs conductor training in Brainerd. Tall, buzzcut, friendly enough. Wore a Red Wings beanie and talked fast, like a guy trying to prove he belonged.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre with me tonight,‚Äù he said, flipping through the manifest. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hauling empties out to Cold Pines Spur.‚Äù

‚ÄúFirst time out there,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt even know it was still in use.‚Äù

He laughed. ‚ÄúBarely. The old Cold Pines mill runs on fumes these days. Maybe one or two night runs a week. Dispatch likes to send new guys there. Less traffic. Less pressure.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt love the idea of running into the woods on a barely-used spur in zero-visibility fog, but I wasn‚Äôt about to complain.

We rolled out just after 9:00 PM in GP9 #1543, a cranky old diesel-electric that smelled like scorched belts and frozen rubber. Thing groaned like a haunted vending machine every time we picked up speed.

The fog only got worse past mile 30. High beams barely cut through five feet of it. Everything looked like we were driving into a sheet of cotton.

Inside the cab, we talked a little. Rob seemed chill ‚Äî more into his phone than his throttle, but competent enough. I brewed weak coffee in my dented thermos and cracked a window for a smoke. Frank never let me smoke in the cab. Rob didn‚Äôt even blink.

I asked him if he‚Äôd run Cold Pines before.  
‚ÄúCouple times,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúQuiet stretch. Middle of nowhere. No signals, no crossings, no wildlife ‚Äòcept maybe a fox or two.‚Äù

Then he added, without changing tone:

‚ÄúSome folks say it‚Äôs haunted. You believe in that crap?‚Äù

I laughed it off. ‚ÄúOnly when the overtime dries up.‚Äù

We‚Äôre on the clock, but technically there‚Äôs no lunch break ‚Äî just ‚Äúequipment inspection‚Äù windows. Everyone knows the routine: you stop somewhere remote, park the engine, kill the lights, and pretend to check couplers for an hour or two while you nap.

At 1:13 AM, dispatch called in with the formal go-ahead.

‚ÄúEngine 1543, Cold Pines Spur ‚Äî authorized technical stop. Log inspection. Over.‚Äù

Rob eased us to a halt in the middle of nowhere. No lights. No sound. Just fog, pines, and the long quiet hum of the cooling engine.

He threw his boots up on the console and said, ‚ÄúYour turn to play inspector. Go hit it with the hammer, rookie.‚Äù

I grabbed my gear and stepped into the dark.

The cold bit like a live wire. Even through my insulated gloves, I could feel it chew at my knuckles. The snow reached my shins. I walked the length of the engine, checking suspension, brake lines, couplers. Nothing looked off. Just a standard walkaround.

I was heading back when something caught my eye off to the left.

In the trees.

Metal.  
Faintly glinting. Almost buried.

I stepped off the embankment, flashlight beam bouncing through the fog like it was underwater. Knees deep in snow, I pulled away a tangle of branches.

A rusted metal number plate.

Frostbitten. Bent. But still legible:

GP9 ‚Äî 211

Not our engine. Ours was 1543.

This thing looked like it‚Äôd been out here since the Carter administration.

That‚Äôs when I heard it.

A snap. Behind me.

Like a frozen branch ‚Äî or a bone.

I turned.

Swept my light across the trees.

At first, I thought it was nothing ‚Äî until I saw them.

Two pale reflections. Eye-level. Not animal. Not human. Just... staring.

They didn‚Äôt move.

Didn‚Äôt blink.

And then, like someone cut the power, they vanished.

No footfalls. No leaves. No sound.

Just gone.

I gripped the number plate tighter and turned back toward the track. Toward the engine.

But it wasn‚Äôt there.

The headlamps were gone.

The metal hum of the generator ‚Äî gone.

Just trees.

Just fog.

And snow, already starting to erase my footprints.

At first, I thought I must‚Äôve gotten turned around. Fog can do that ‚Äî mess with your sense of distance. But I knew I hadn‚Äôt walked that far. I‚Äôd gone maybe thirty, forty yards off the embankment. The engine should‚Äôve been right behind me.

I spun in a slow circle. Trees. Fog. More trees.

No rumble of diesel. No cab lights. No Rob, feet on the console, thumbing through his phone.

Just me.

Just white silence and the slow crunch of my own boots as I shifted my weight.

Something in the air had changed. The cold was deeper now ‚Äî not just freezing but¬†*still*. Heavy. Like the snow itself was holding its breath.

I started walking, number plate tucked under my arm, scanning for any sign of the train. Every step felt heavier. The snow wasn‚Äôt deeper, but my boots sank like the ground was softer. Off.¬†*Wrong*.

After maybe ten minutes of stumbling, I stopped.

And that‚Äôs when I noticed something else.

No sound.

No trees creaking.

No wind.

Not even the distant hum of power from the engine.

Dead silence.

Total.

That‚Äôs when I heard it again.

Crunch.

But not mine.

Not footsteps, either.

Something different.

Wet.  
Like tendons grinding.  
Like a joint bending the wrong way.

Then another.

Crrrk.  
Like a neck being twisted too far. Bone on bone.

I raised the flashlight and slowly turned toward the sound.

There ‚Äî in the fog ‚Äî maybe ten yards out:

Two glowing eyes. Same height as before. But closer.

Too close.

And this time... they¬†*moved*.

Not forward. Not side to side.

They drifted. Circling.

Drawing wide, slow eights in the fog.  
Like a predator testing the shape of its prey.

I didn‚Äôt breathe. My heart punched against my ribs, adrenaline flooding my legs.

I whispered to myself:

‚ÄúRun.‚Äù

And I¬†*did*.

I tore through the trees, crashing over roots and frozen brush, snow soaking into my coveralls. I didn‚Äôt care. I didn‚Äôt look back. I couldn‚Äôt. My brain wouldn‚Äôt let me.

Every instinct screamed the same thing:  
Don‚Äôt stop. Don‚Äôt turn. Don‚Äôt let it catch up.

Branches scraped my shoulders. I slipped, slammed into a trunk, righted myself, kept moving.

I didn‚Äôt know which way the tracks were anymore. Everything looked the same ‚Äî fog, trees, white on white on white.

Then I saw it ‚Äî a break in the treeline.

The embankment. The ballast slope of the railbed.

I scrambled up like a rat from a flood, boots slipping on frozen gravel. Made it to the middle of the tracks and stopped, panting, dizzy.

And just like that ‚Äî  
the feeling lifted.

A flicker of relief.

But... something was wrong.

I turned. Looked both ways.

No engine.

No lights.

No train.

Just rusted rails, stretching in both directions, covered in snow. The ties beneath me weren‚Äôt concrete like on our spur line ‚Äî they were old wood, splintered, weatherworn, creosote-soaked.

I frowned and kicked at one of them with my boot.

The wood cracked under the toe ‚Äî dry rot.  
These tracks hadn‚Äôt seen service in¬†*decades*.

No fresh polish on the rail tops. No warmth from metal that had been under an engine minutes ago.

This wasn‚Äôt our line.

I started walking, heading the way I¬†*thought*¬†the train had stopped. Fog swallowed everything beyond twenty feet. My flashlight bounced along the rail, catching flakes and shadows that shifted the more I focused on them.

Then I saw it ‚Äî a mile marker.

Old concrete post. Faded, chipped. Mounted low to the ground, half-buried in snow.

I wiped the frost off the metal plate:

Mile Marker 211

I froze.

That couldn‚Äôt be right.

Cold Pines Spur was only fifteen miles long ‚Äî it didn‚Äôt have numbered mile markers like this. And our manifest listed no marker 211 anywhere on the route.

This track didn‚Äôt exist.

Not anymore.

I stood there, heart racing, trying to make sense of it ‚Äî when I heard it again.

Crrrk.

Right behind me.

Not just near me ‚Äî right behind me.

So close I could feel it in my own spine.

My stomach turned cold.

I reached slowly into my vest pocket, fingers brushing the hammer. Grip slick with nervous sweat.

I turned.

And saw it.

It stood on the rail.  
Not moving.

Not blinking.

Human-shaped ‚Äî but not human.

Tall, gaunt, bone-pale in the fog, wearing what looked like a torn nightgown or dress. One arm hung at an unnatural angle, elbow reversed, fingers twitching. Its skin looked damp, stretched too thin across the joints.

Its head tilted.

Then twisted, vertebrae cracking one by one as it rotated ‚Äî not just to the side, but¬†*backward*, slowly, like it was dislocating its own neck to look at me.

The face was... shattered.

Bits of skull showed through a torn scalp. Long strands of gray hair clung to frozen skin. One side of its mouth was torn open to the cheek ‚Äî a permanent grin. Teeth yellowed and too many.  
And the eyes ‚Äî bright, white, glowing green from within ‚Äî locked on me like it already knew how I‚Äôd taste.

But worse ‚Äî worse than all of that ‚Äî

It was holding something.

Wrapped in old, wet newspaper.  
A bundle.  
A shape.

Two tiny legs dangled out.

A baby.

Something inside me snapped.

I shouted. Raised the hammer, ready to strike, knowing I‚Äôd die but wanting to¬†*do something*¬†before it took me apart.

And then‚Äî

A blur behind it.

A hand.

A hammer.

Crack.

Steel connected with the thing‚Äôs skull ‚Äî sunk deep into the temple. A splash of dark fluid sprayed out, sizzling against snow.

The creature shrieked ‚Äî not with pain, but like it had been¬†*insulted*. It jerked, twisted around at something behind it, and ‚Äî without a sound ‚Äî bolted into the trees.

The woods swallowed it instantly.

I stood there, breathing like a cornered dog, hammer still raised.

And from the fog stepped a man.

Old.

Wearing a faded conductor‚Äôs uniform ‚Äî navy blue with silver trim. Cap pulled low. Heavy coat, old-style boots, a metal lantern swinging from one hand.

He had a wide, serious face. Thick white mustache. Eyes like glass bottle-green. Steady. Focused.

He looked at me, then down at the fallen number plate beside my boot. I hadn‚Äôt realized I‚Äôd dropped it.

He stooped, picked it up, brushed snow off it with one gloved hand.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt belong here, son.‚Äù

His voice was low, deep, like a freight train under throttle. Calm, but full of warning.

‚ÄúThis place don‚Äôt take kindly to souvenirs.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt belong here, son.‚Äù

The old man‚Äôs voice wasn‚Äôt angry ‚Äî but it wasn‚Äôt friendly either. Like a stern uncle catching you somewhere you weren‚Äôt supposed to be.

He stared at the number plate in his hands ‚Äî GP9 ‚Äì 211 ‚Äî and his face changed. Not with fear. Not even surprise. Just... resignation. Like he‚Äôd seen it before. Like it was expected.

‚ÄúYou dropped this,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúYou can keep it.‚Äù

He gave me a sharp look and stepped forward, placing the plate under one arm like it was his. Maybe it always had been.

He looked me over.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre with Holloway, right? Frank?‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúYeah. Not tonight, though. I got paired with‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù He waved it off. ‚ÄúYou tell Frank Old Man Connor said hello. Tell him I still remember what he owes me.‚Äù

My stomach twisted.

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Connor?‚Äù

He nodded once, crisp. ‚ÄúUsed to run the 211 line. Back before they tore it up. Before the Cold Pines reroute.‚Äù

My throat went dry.  
That number. The plate. The engine. The mile marker. It was all the same line.

I stepped back, heart pounding again.

‚ÄúIs this... are you‚Äî?‚Äú

‚ÄúI‚Äôm what‚Äôs left,‚Äù he said, cutting me off. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think too hard about it. Won‚Äôt help.‚Äù

He turned and pointed back the way I‚Äôd come ‚Äî only now I realized... I could see track lights in the distance. The fog had shifted. Just a little.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs your line,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúReal one. Keep walking. Don‚Äôt stop. Don‚Äôt turn. And whatever you do...‚Äù

He looked at me, dead serious.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take anything with you.‚Äù

I looked down ‚Äî the plate was gone from the snow. Still tucked under his arm.

Something about the way he held it ‚Äî like it was more than metal. Like it was¬†*anchor*. Weight.

‚ÄúWhat the hell was that thing?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúHer?‚Äù he said, voice suddenly softer. ‚ÄúSome memories don‚Äôt die right. Some keep walking. Screaming. Crying for what they lost.‚Äù

He turned again, starting to disappear into the mist.

‚ÄúWhat did she lose?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt stop walking.

‚ÄúEverything.‚Äù

And then he was gone.

I walked.

I don‚Äôt know how long. Maybe a mile. Maybe five minutes. Maybe an hour.

But eventually, the fog thinned ‚Äî and I saw it.

The engine.

GP9 #1543.

Sitting exactly where we‚Äôd parked it.

Lights on. Diesel humming. Like nothing had ever happened.

I climbed up fast, threw the cab door open, nearly tripping over myself.

‚ÄúJesus!‚Äù Rob shouted, jumping. ‚ÄúDude, where the hell were you?‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt speak right away. My throat burned from the cold and fear and whatever the hell had just happened. I dropped into the seat and tried to breathe.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pale as hell,‚Äù Rob said. ‚ÄúYou okay? You fall or something?‚Äù

I just nodded, slow. ‚ÄúInspection took longer than I thought.‚Äù

He gave me a weird look, but didn‚Äôt push.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre almost done anyway. Dispatch just cleared us for reverse pull. Let‚Äôs get the hell outta here before the weather gets worse.‚Äù

Music to my ears.

We rolled back toward Violet Ridge. Trees on either side still looked the same ‚Äî heavy, dark, breathless. But the further we got from Mile Marker 211, the easier it was to breathe.

I didn‚Äôt say a word the whole ride back. Rob didn‚Äôt notice. He had earbuds in, scrolling something on his phone.

When we hit the yard, we handed off the paperwork and clocked out. My hands were still shaking.

At sunrise, I sat behind the depot with a cigarette I wasn‚Äôt supposed to have. I watched the breath rise off my fingers and tried not to think about what I‚Äôd seen. What I‚Äôd¬†*felt*.

That‚Äôs when I overheard the old-timers talking.

There‚Äôs this little makeshift smoke shack behind the yard office. Real classy ‚Äî sheet metal walls, bucket for a chair, and a cracked thermos someone left in 1998. But the guys love it. They say more truth gets passed around in that shack than in any union meeting.

That morning, they were talking about Frank Holloway.

‚ÄúHe asked for the night off?‚Äù

‚ÄúFirst time in twenty years.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe always goes quiet this time of year. You know what happened, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. That old derailment. Cold Pines, before the reroute.‚Äù

I leaned in just enough to hear, keeping my mouth shut.

‚ÄúHe was on that train. Back when it was still the 211 line. His engineer ‚Äî Connor Reeves ‚Äî died keeping the brake engaged so Frank could jump.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Heard Frank sees him sometimes. Swears he‚Äôs still out there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, hell. Maybe he is.‚Äù

They laughed. The kind of laugh men use when they¬†*don‚Äôt*¬†think it‚Äôs funny but can‚Äôt admit they‚Äôre scared.

I caught one of the mechanics later ‚Äî Eli ‚Äî and asked him straight.

‚ÄúYou ever hear of GP9 number 211?‚Äù

He looked at me a long time.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said finally. ‚ÄúCame off the line in ‚Äô59. Ran the Cold Pines Spur for about fifteen years. Derailment killed the engineer. They pulled the rails after that. Didn‚Äôt even salvage the engine ‚Äî buried it out there.‚Äù

‚ÄúBuried?‚Äù

‚ÄúGround was too unstable to haul it out. The car behind it ‚Äî log carrier ‚Äî was empty. Lucky.‚Äù

He paused.

‚ÄúWhy you ask?‚Äù

I hesitated.

‚ÄúSaw something out there. A plate. Number matched.‚Äù

He stopped chewing. His jaw just hung there for a second.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch anything out there,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bring anything back. Not even rust.‚Äù

Then he walked off.

I put in for a transfer a week later.

Took a pay cut. Moved back downstate. Smaller depot. Safer routes.

Frank retired that spring. I never saw him again.

But sometimes, on nights when the fog rolls in thick and the engines hum just¬†*so*, I think about Mile Marker 211.

About the thing that walked out of the trees holding a dead child.

About the man who warned me just in time.

And about how¬†*close*¬†I came to joining them.

¬†

I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about the plate.

GP9 ‚Äì 211.  
Old Man Connor‚Äôs train.

Buried, not scrapped. Left to rot somewhere in that frostbitten stretch of nowhere, entombed with whatever still walked those woods. I kept hearing the way he‚Äôd said it:

‚ÄúSome memories don‚Äôt die right.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt sleep much that week. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that thing. Its neck bending backward. Its smile too wide. The limp bundle in its arms.

I tried convincing myself it was a hallucination ‚Äî hypothermia, fatigue, a stress-dream. But there were things I couldn‚Äôt explain:

* The number plate.
* The mile marker that didn‚Äôt exist on any current map.
* The old man in the conductor‚Äôs uniform... who shouldn‚Äôt have been there.

Or¬†*couldn‚Äôt*.

I spent three nights researching. Rail archives, crash logs, railfan forums. Anything I could dig up on Cold Pines Spur, Mile Marker 211, or engine 211 itself.

Most of it was dead ends ‚Äî until I found a scanned clipping from a local paper, dated January 17th, 1977.

‚ÄúDERAILMENT ON NORTHERN TIMBER LINE CLAIMS ENGINEER‚ÄôS LIFE‚Äù  
*‚ÄúEarly Sunday morning, a GP9 locomotive derailed near mile marker 211 on the Cold Pines Spur, resulting in the death of 57-year-old conductor Connor Reeves. Investigators cite missing rail anchors and loose ballast as possible causes. The assistant engineer, Frank Holloway, survived the incident with minor injuries. Eyewitness accounts indicate Reeves stayed in the cabin to manually engage the emergency brakes while instructing Holloway to evacuate. No other crew were onboard. No cargo was being hauled at the time.‚Äù*

My blood ran cold.

It was all true.

The derailment. The mile marker. Frank.

And Connor‚Ä¶ he‚Äôd died holding the brake, keeping the engine from tumbling into the ravine with both of them onboard.

There was one more name mentioned in the article. A short, sad footnote at the bottom.

‚ÄúThe incident occurred less than a mile from where a woman and infant were struck and killed by a Northern Timber locomotive in 1963. The location has long been considered a ‚Äòtroubled‚Äô section of track by employees.‚Äù

No other details.

No names.

I dug deeper.

Eventually, I found a digitized coroner‚Äôs report ‚Äî barely readable, yellowed scan, probably forgotten in some microfiche archive for decades.

Name: Louise Everett  
Date of Death: February 3, 1963  
Cause: Blunt-force trauma, consistent with railway impact.  
Notes: Victim was found on tracks with deceased infant in arms. History of postpartum psychosis noted.  
Next of kin: James Everett ‚Äî engineer, Northern Timber Line.

That was it.

She wasn‚Äôt just a casualty.

She was the engineer‚Äôs wife.

She‚Äôd lost her mind. Took their baby and walked into her husband‚Äôs line of travel. He was running the train that night. There was nothing he could do.

She waited for him.

And made him watch.

Suddenly, the pieces started falling into place.

That thing I‚Äôd seen ‚Äî the dress, the twisted limbs, the baby ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt random.

It wasn‚Äôt just a ghost.

It was¬†*her*.

Louise Everett.

Still walking the tracks.

Still cradling what was left.

Still screaming,¬†*quietly*, for something no one could give back.

And the 211 line ‚Äî that stretch of rail ‚Äî had soaked it all in.

The grief. The trauma. The broken metal and shattered people.

Connor died trying to hold it together.

Frank survived and¬†*never went back*.

The company rerouted everything away from that section not long after. Official reason? ""Structural instability."" Unofficially? The crews just stopped going. Too many stories. Too many close calls. Too much¬†*wrong*.

Even the new spur ‚Äî Cold Pines ‚Äî was built to bend around that area. Avoid the old scar. But sometimes, on long nights, in the right fog...

You still cross it.

I thought about confronting Frank.

About going to his house, or calling him, just to ask what he really saw that night in ‚Äò77.

But something stopped me.

Maybe I didn‚Äôt want to hear it. Maybe I already¬†*knew*.

Instead, I waited a few days, then went back to the shop.

There was an old locker in the far corner of the depot. Rusted. Padlock busted. Used to belong to one of the retirees ‚Äî the kind of guy who never threw anything out.

Inside were stacks of manuals, parts catalogs, faded engineer caps.

And pinned to the back wall, half-covered in dust:

A photo.

Two men, standing in front of a diesel engine.  
GP9 ‚Äì 211.  
Clean. Shiny. New.

One man I didn‚Äôt recognize.

The other ‚Äî unmistakably Frank Holloway.

Young. Smiling.

Alive.

I don‚Äôt know what possessed me to take it.

But I did.

I slipped the photo into my wallet and left the depot without saying a word.

That night, I had the first nightmare in weeks.

A screech of metal.  
The¬†*clang*¬†of a brake lever.  
A woman‚Äôs voice whispering something I couldn‚Äôt understand.

And in the fog ‚Äî a lantern.  
Swinging.  
Getting closer.

I told myself I was done.

That whatever happened out there‚Äîon that stretch of Cold Pines Spur‚Äîwas a one-time thing. A bad dream. A cold night gone worse.

But I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it.

Not the thing in the trees. Not the dead child. Not even Connor.

It was the number that haunted me.

211.

The mile marker.  
The engine.  
The date on the old newspaper article.  
The sound of the radio transmission that hadn‚Äôt been broadcast in forty years.

I started to realize something:  
That number wasn‚Äôt random.

It was a pattern.

A mark.

A grave.

Three weeks passed.

Then the nightmares started again.

But this time, they didn‚Äôt feel like memories.

They felt like instructions.

I‚Äôd wake up cold and sweating, with that number in my head like a countdown.

So I did the one thing I promised myself I wouldn‚Äôt do.

I went back.

I didn‚Äôt take a rail vehicle.

I drove up past Ely in my truck, alone. No company vest. No gear. Just a flashlight, boots, and my coffee thermos. January again‚Äîof course it was. Same kind of night: bitter cold, fog so thick it turned the headlights to milk.

I parked near the split where Cold Pines Spur diverged from the main. There‚Äôs no signage anymore. No reason for anyone to go past that point.

Except me.

I walked.

The trees were silent.

Fog blanketed everything. The deeper I went, the more I felt like I was walking through a tunnel‚Äîwalls made of pine, roof made of dead air.

And then I saw it.

The rails.

Same as before‚Äîrusted, warped, forgotten. And just ahead, like it had been waiting:

Mile Marker 211.

A chipped concrete post with a rust-stained steel faceplate. Crooked in the ground, but still standing.

I knelt and brushed snow off the base.

There were scratch marks‚Äîrough and uneven.

Letters.

Almost worn away.

L O U I

That was it. Like someone started writing LOUISE, and stopped. Or never finished.

A cold wind pushed through the trees.

And then I heard the crunch behind me.

I turned fast.

Connor stood at the tree line.

Same long coat. Same old lantern. Eyes sharper this time.

He walked toward me, slow but sure, and stopped beside the mile marker.

‚ÄúBack again,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI need answers,‚Äù I told him.

He nodded, like he expected that.

‚ÄúThe 211 engine went off the track right here,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBack in '77. You already know that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat you don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he continued, ‚Äúis that this marker... this stretch of rail... wasn‚Äôt always mile 211.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

He pointed at the post. ‚ÄúWhen the company laid new rail out here in the '60s, they renumbered segments. Shortcuts. Accounting tricks. They moved the numbers around. But she didn‚Äôt forget.‚Äù

I felt the hair rise on my arms.

‚ÄúSo the number‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúShe took it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTied it to the place. Made it hers.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd the engine?‚Äù

‚ÄúGP9 #211,‚Äù he said, with a bitter laugh. ‚ÄúGuess what mile we reached when she stepped onto the tracks? Mile 211. Of course it was. She waited for him there. Her husband. The engineer.‚Äù

He looked up at me, dead serious.

‚ÄúThat number doesn‚Äôt just mark a place. It marks a cycle. That engine didn‚Äôt derail by accident. It was pulled off. Brought home. Back to her.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs... like a loop?‚Äù

He shook his head. ‚ÄúNo. Worse. It‚Äôs a route. A scheduled run. She‚Äôs not stuck here. She‚Äôs still traveling it. Over and over.‚Äù

Then he looked at me, hard.

‚ÄúAnd now you‚Äôve stepped on it.‚Äù

Fog thickened again.

From the distance came a low hum, not mechanical ‚Äî more like electricity in the teeth.

Connor looked back down the track.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs coming,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs always on time.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do I do?‚Äù

‚ÄúGet off the line. And don‚Äôt look back.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut what about you?‚Äù

He smiled, sadly.

‚ÄúI never got off the train.‚Äù

I ran.

Didn‚Äôt ask how. Didn‚Äôt think. Just ran.

Snow kicked up behind me as the trees blurred past. That hum grew louder ‚Äî deeper ‚Äî and beneath it, I heard screaming.

A woman‚Äôs voice.

A child crying.

A conductor shouting to pull the brake.

I reached the crossing road near the split and dove behind the tree line just as the fog surged forward ‚Äî like a wave swallowing everything.

Then it passed.

And everything went quiet again.

I didn‚Äôt go back.

Not for a long time.

I transferred routes. Took yard shifts. Never went north again.

But a few days ago, I got a package.

No return address. No stamp.

Inside: A small metal tag.

Scorched. Pitted. Letters barely visible.

But still there.

Mile Marker 212

No note.

Just that.

I don‚Äôt sleep much these days.

Because now I understand.

It‚Äôs not a haunting.

It‚Äôs a timetable.

And she‚Äôs still making her run.

Height: 5‚Äô9‚Äù (5‚Äô10‚Äù with good posture and caffeine)
Location: Finland (not Finnish, but this ‚Äúsummer‚Äù has me finnish-ed)

I‚Äôm originally from Sri Lanka, now building a life in Finland. I write songs, poetry and a hopeless romantic.

Life‚Äôs taken me on a winding journey, but at this stage, I‚Äôd love to find someone genuine to share it with.

A little about me:

‚Ä¢I speak 6 languages fluently (fumbling through a 7th). Multilingual chaos.
‚Ä¢I drink and smoke occasionally.
‚Ä¢I want kids someday.
‚Ä¢I‚Äôd prefer if you‚Äôre based in Europe (long distance is tough, though I‚Äôll put in the effort if you‚Äôre truly worth it).

What I‚Äôm looking for (23‚Äì29):
‚Ä¢Someone witty, sarcastic, and not afraid of playful banter
‚Ä¢A dark sense of humor (and an even darker cup of coffee)
‚Ä¢Curious by nature-whether it‚Äôs history, philosophy, spirituality or why autumn is the best season ever.

Music is therapy for me. If you‚Äôre into Linkin Park, RHCP, Metallica, Audioslave, Poets of the Fall, Eminem, NF, Logic, or Kodaline, we‚Äôll probably click.

What I‚Äôm not into: ghosting, endless small talk, or fake fronts.

What I am into: honesty, deep conversations, loyal connections, and maybe a little bit of chaos wrapped in comfort.

If you‚Äôre looking for someone who‚Äôs loyal, ambitious, and just a little bit poetic about life, slide into my DMs.

I was just hired in at a school as an intervention specialist. I'm a contractor working for an outside company who works with this school to act as an additional aide/paraprofessional. I have an unlimited substitute license (I'm currently studying to renew my license as an English teacher, I never went to school for special education), so a lot of the job duties of the person I am replacing I cannot do. For example, since I do not have the correct license, I cannot write IEPs. My coworkers (actually licensed intervention specialists) are frustrated with me because I know nothing and basically cannot do anything.

I sent an email to my manager to ask what my job duties are exactly, as I legally cannot do what the person I am replacing was doing. More than anything I wanted to cover my own ass, as I don't want to get in any legal trouble. I was told, ""you will be given resources and shown how to complete all of your assigned duties. We don't have a specific document with your exact responsibilities outlined yet, since we just changed to implementing services through this model this school year. I am working on putting a document together though, so as soon as I'm finished with it, I will share it with you.""

All my predecessor had left to finish is writing the IEPs for the students on my caseload. And again - legally I can't do this. So, I've just been hanging out waiting for any further instructions. I read a book yesterday, and I'll probably read another one today. I've also been grabbing coffee and tying to help my new coworkers whenever I can. But without job responsibilities - what AM I supposed to be doing exactly?

I recently moved cities away from my home (which had excellent tap water) and now have very flat tasting brews with much less clarity in their notes. Whilst I had success in brews using bottled water, the growing piles of plastic made me feel very guilty. I began by buying a zero water pitcher to get a supply of 0 tds water to remineralise, and am now looking for the minerals to do that with.

My main is which of the various coffee water mineral products I should buy? (I live in the UK)

Ones I have come across include Apax lab, lotus water, third wave water, April coffee water. I have no experience using any of these yet so would love a recommendation about which to get. Some factors I would like to consider are: ability to alter the recipe to specific coffees/simplicity to prepare batches of water/availability in the UK/ and cost per cup. I drink mainly light to ultralight washed coffees if that makes any difference

And advice on the options is greatly appreciated, or if there is any coffee water solution I have not yet come across then I would be eager to hear about it.  ",2,1758645209.0,pourover,7,1.0,False

It Knew My Name,"Since I was thirteen, I've been obsessed with what most people ignore. Not ghosts. Not little green men. Something older. Quieter. Radio waves. Invisible threads humming through the air 24/7. Passing through walls. Through bodies. Through us.

While most people moved on to cable, CDs, and the internet, I stayed up late with a beat-up shortwave receiver. Tuning knobs. Chasing ghosts made of static.

My name is James Brooks. I'm in my early forties. I've worked in comms my whole life. I live alone, just outside town. I run diagnostics and comms repairs for a small contractor... and listen by night.

Because shortwave isn't normal radio. It's global. It bounces off the sky itself. And sometimes‚Äîjust sometimes‚Äîit bounces back something you're not supposed to hear.

I've picked up signals from Taiwan. Fishing chatter from Norway. Once, even a burst of coded gibberish that chilled me to the bone. But the weirdest of all? The numbers stations.

Calm voices. Female. Robotic. Sometimes... children. Reciting sequences of numbers. No music. No intro. Just ""Seven... four... one... three... zero..."" Again. And again.

Nobody knows who runs them. Cold War leftovers? Spy networks? Or... something worse?

At first, I thought I was just listening. Until one night... one of them spoke my name.

It started on a Wednesday night. The air in my apartment felt heavier than usual. Still. Like something was waiting.

I'd been scanning for over an hour. Static, fragments of foreign weather reports, occasional amateur ham conversations‚Äînothing unusual. I was about to shut everything off, go to bed.

Then I heard her.

""Seven... three... two... two... eight. Repeat. Seven... three... two... two... eight.""

A child's voice. Calm. Rhythmic. Emotionless. It cut straight through the noise‚Äîlike it didn't belong in the same frequency range. Like it was riding something underneath the signal.

I froze. Reached for my phone. Hit record. My hands were trembling just a little.

The voice went on for nearly two minutes. Repeating the same five digits. Then‚Äînothing. Static again.

I sat there in the dark, headphones still on, trying to process what I'd just heard. Something about it felt... wrong. Not fake. Not paranormal. But personal.

I uploaded the clip to an old shortwave forum I'd used for years with a quick caption: ""Weird numbers station tonight. Child's voice repeating 73228. Frequency 6925 kHz. Anyone else?""

Then I shut everything down and climbed into bed. Didn't sleep well. My dreams were full of static. Whispers. Endless digits floating in blackness.

Next morning, I woke to a flood of notifications. My post had blown up overnight. Comments poured in: ""Dude, I caught something like this last month. Same frequency. Different voice. Different number."" ""Are you sure it wasn't a pirate station?""

And then one comment caught my attention. Simple. Direct.

SilentWhisper7: ""You shouldn't be listening to this.""

I stared at the screen for a long time. Something about that username... the way they phrased it... It didn't feel like trolling.

I replied, asking what they meant. No response.

That night, I sat back down at my radio. Same time. Same setup. Heart beating just a bit faster.

For a while‚Äînothing. The same dead static, the soft hiss in my headphones.

Then the signal returned. Same voice. Same pattern. But something had changed. The tone. The rhythm. It sounded... closer.

""Four... seven... two... James. Repeat. Four... seven... two... James.""

I froze. My blood ran cold. It said my name.

I ripped the headphones off. For a full minute, I just sat there, staring at the floor. Heart hammering. Mouth dry.

Eventually, I hit replay on my phone recording. Just in case I'd misheard. Nope. The voice was clear. Unmistakable. ""James.""

I tried to rationalize it. Maybe someone online saw my post and spoofed the broadcast. But how would they know when I'd be listening? How would they hijack a frequency like that?

Was it a coincidence? Auditory pareidolia? A trick of my own tired mind?

I wanted to believe that. But deep down, I knew better.

I posted again. Urgent. Desperate. ""I just heard my name broadcast on 6925. Has this happened to anyone else? Please tell me I'm not crazy.""

Some comments mocked me. Some suggested stress, sleep deprivation. One even said I was chasing clout.

But a few took me seriously. Some described hearing their names in other sequences. Others claimed to have been hearing whispers long after turning off their radios.

One comment from SilentWhisper7 came again, this time private: ""These aren't just numbers. They're sequences. Personalized. You've been marked. Stop listening‚Äîbefore it's too late.""

No explanation. No context. Just that.

And still... I didn't stop.

The next night, I listened again. I told myself I wouldn't. I told myself I needed sleep. But the static was calling me.

There's something about numbers stations‚Äîonce you hear them, really hear them‚Äîthey pull at you.

And sure enough... she came back. Not right away. Almost like she was waiting.

Then‚Äîclear, deliberate, cold: ""Four... seven... two... James."" Again. Again. Always the same.

Like she knew I was there. Like she was looking at me through the frequency.

I didn't record this one. Couldn't bring myself to move. I just sat. Listening. Shaking.

And when it ended... the silence didn't feel like silence anymore. It felt like she was still there.

I didn't sleep at all that night. I kept the lights on. I paced the apartment. Every shadow looked heavier. Every creak in the floor made me flinch.

I even unplugged the radio. But it didn't help. Because sometime around 4 A.M., I thought I heard it again.

No headphones. No signal. Just... whispers. Barely audible. Coming from behind the walls. Numbers. Slow. Measured. Like someone was speaking directly into the wiring.

The next day I tried to act normal. I went to work. Talked to customers. Sold two routers and a surge protector.

But I was fraying at the edges. Like my skin didn't fit right anymore.

When I got home that night, I didn't even touch the radio. Didn't open Reddit. Didn't look at anything that might spark it again.

But then, around midnight, I got another message. SilentWhisper7. No greeting. No explanation. ""Did you hear them without the radio? If yes, they've already marked you. You need to leave. Now.""

That was it.

I grabbed my keys and drove straight to my friend Alex's apartment. He was the only person I could really trust with something this weird.

Alex and I had been friends since high school. He was a skeptic by nature. Grounded. Rational. Exactly the kind of person I needed.

He met me at the door, half-asleep but concerned. Let me inside. Made coffee.

I told him everything. Every detail. The voice. The number. My name. The whispers.

He listened without interrupting, which was rare for him. When I finally finished, he just stared into his cup and said, ""Okay... I don't know if I believe all of it. But I do believe that you believe it. And that's enough for me.""

I stayed on his couch that night. Didn't sleep much, but I felt safer with someone nearby.

At least until 3:17 A.M. That's when Alex's old clock radio‚Äîunplugged‚Äîclicked on.

Just static at first. Then a voice. Male this time. Familiar.

""Six... one... nine... three... Alex.""

His name.

Alex bolted upright on the couch across from me. We locked eyes, neither of us speaking.

Then the voice repeated it. ""Six... one... nine... three... Alex.""

He jumped up and yanked the cord from the wall‚Äîagain. Even though it wasn't plugged in.

The voice cut out. The silence that followed was unbearable.

That was the turning point. Alex didn't think I was crazy anymore.

He didn't go to work the next day. Didn't turn on his phone. We sat at his kitchen table for hours, trying to make sense of it.

His only question was, ""Why us?""

We spent that afternoon digging deep‚Äîforums, old posts, archived threads, conspiracy sites. Most of it was garbage. Fake stories. ARGs. Troll bait.

But a few entries stood out. People describing stations that said their names. Or that whispered when no radios were on.

One post ended with: ""It's not a broadcast. It's a transmission vector.""

That phrase stuck with me.

That night, I returned home to grab a few essentials. Clothes. My backup drive. A hard copy of frequencies I'd logged over the years.

The apartment felt... contaminated. I moved quickly. Tried not to look at the radio still sitting on my desk.

But just as I zipped up my bag‚Äîit turned on. By itself. No power. No antenna. Just static.

Then the voice. ""Four... seven... two... James. Broadcast begins.""

I grabbed the radio, heart pounding, and ripped it off the desk. Threw it against the wall. It cracked, sparked, and fell silent.

Five seconds later... I heard the voice again. Not from the radio. From my phone speaker. It had turned on its own recorder. Somehow. And it was playing the exact same voice back to me in real time.

I left the apartment. Didn't lock the door. Didn't look back.

When I got to Alex's, I told him everything. He didn't laugh. Didn't question it. He just asked, ""What if it's not a station anymore? What if it's inside the devices now?""

I didn't have an answer.

Around 2 A.M., we both passed out from sheer exhaustion.

I woke up to find Alex gone. His phone still on the table. Coffee half-full.

His clock radio was buzzing‚Äîon again. And his voice was coming from it.

""Three... three... one... five... James... Repeat. Three... three... one... five... James...""

I turned it off. Unplugged it. Smashed it. Still... the voice didn't stop. It moved to the speakers in the kitchen. Then the TV‚Äîoff, but whispering. Same message. Same tone. Same impossible logic.

That was the last time I saw Alex. He never came back. His phone's GPS stopped updating. His Reddit account was deleted the next day.

All that remained was his voice, now part of the signal.

After Alex vanished, I didn't go home again. I bounced between motels. Used cash. Turned off my phone. No electronics, no screens, no radios.

Didn't matter. The voices followed anyway. They no longer waited for signals or wires. They came in silence. In dreams. In the spaces between breaths.

I stopped trying to explain it to people. Because how do you explain that you're being followed by... a frequency? That your best friend's voice now lives in the static? That numbers... can haunt?

And then, SilentWhisper7 messaged me again. This time with coordinates. A remote spot outside the city. No explanation. Just: ""If you want answers‚Äîcome alone.""

I went. What else was I going to do?

I found an abandoned farmhouse, half-collapsed, with a rusted satellite dish in the backyard. Inside, it was dark, silent, except for the soft hiss of old equipment still humming.

He was already there. Middle-aged. Gaunt. Sunken eyes. Unshaved. Like someone who hadn't slept in weeks‚Äîor months.

""You're James,"" he said. Not a question.

I nodded. He motioned for me to sit. I did.

He didn't waste time. ""They call it Voice 472,"" he said. ""We don't know who built it. Or why. But it's older than it should be. Some of the tech in there predates public shortwave transmission.""

I asked what it was.

He looked me dead in the eye. ""It's not a station. It's a signal vector. An infection. You don't listen to it. It listens to you.""

He explained that the sequences weren't just code. They were activation phrases. Once your sequence is spoken‚Äîand you hear it‚Äîsomething connects. Something opens. You're no longer just a listener. You become part of the broadcast.

I asked him if there was any way to stop it.

He handed me a USB stick. ""On here,"" he said, ""are reversed signal pulses. Early countermeasures. They can confuse the frequency. Disrupt it. Temporarily.""

""But not destroy it?""

""No,"" he said. ""You can't destroy a voice that isn't speaking.""

That night, in a motel room off Highway 73, I played the reversed signals through headphones. The effect was immediate. My nose bled. I blacked out for maybe twenty seconds.

But when I came to‚Äîthe voices were gone. For the first time in weeks... silence. True silence.

I thought it was over. But I was wrong.

It was never about stopping the voices. It was about finishing the sequence.

At 3:00 A.M., my motel TV flickered on. On its own. Black screen. Green text blinking: ""SUBJECT 472 STREAM COMPLETE.""

Then the voice: ""New node identified. Subject... four... seven... three... Ready.""

A pause. Then, softly‚Äîright next to my ear: ""Are you listening?""

It was the radio in the motel's room. I smashed the radio. Tore the wires out with my bare hands and hurled the remains against the wall. Plastic cracked. The speaker sparked. Silence.

But the silence didn't last.

That night, as I tried to sleep, I heard it again. No headphones. No devices. Nothing plugged in. Just the darkness... and the voice.

""Four... seven... two... James. Repeat. Four... seven... two... James.""

I sat up in bed, shaking. My ears weren't ringing‚Äîthey were receiving.

The next morning, I threw what was left of the radio into a dumpster three blocks away. Then I unplugged everything. Laptop. Router. Even my microwave.

Didn't help. Because the whispering wasn't in the wires anymore. It was in the quiet. In the space behind my thoughts. Between breaths.

When the world went still... the numbers came. ""Four... seven... two... James...""

That night, I returned to Alex's place. I didn't even have to explain. He opened the door, eyes hollow, and just said, ""I've been hearing it too.""

We sat in silence for a while. Then he told me everything.

It started last night. ""I thought I dreamt it‚Äîjust static at first. Then I heard a voice. Six... one... nine... three... Alex. Repeating it. Calm. Like it knew I was listening.""

His voice shook. ""Then my phone glitched. The flashlight turned on by itself. And I saw something written on the screen...""

He took a shaky breath. ""NEW NODE IDENTIFIED.""

That was the moment we both knew this wasn't paranoia. It was happening. And now it was spreading.

Later that night, I found Alex standing in the kitchen. Faucet running. Hands trembling. Mouthing something over and over: ""Six... one... nine... three... Six... one... nine... three...""

I called his name. No answer. His eyes were glassy. Unblinking.

Then suddenly‚Äîhe blinked. Looked at me like I'd just appeared out of nowhere. ""James... I think I need to go.""

""Go where?""

""I don't know. I just know I can't stay. It's too loud in here. Even when it's quiet.""

He grabbed his jacket and walked out the door. Didn't take his phone. Didn't say goodbye.

That was the last time I saw him.

I waited. An hour. Then two. I texted. Called. Nothing.

By morning, Alex's phone had been deactivated. No last location. No posts. His apartment? Empty. Drawers untouched. Bed made. Coffee mug still warm.

It was like he'd never come home‚Äîor never existed.

That afternoon, I got another message from SilentWhisper7. Short. Cold. ""He heard the full sequence. He's inside now. Don't follow.""

Attached was an audio file. I almost deleted it. But something in me... needed to know.

I put on headphones. Pressed play.

Silence. Then static. Then... Alex's voice. ""Three... three... one... five... James... Repeat. Three... three... one... five...""

I ripped the headphones off. Fell backward out of my chair.

He wasn't speaking to me. He was broadcasting.

After that, things spiraled fast. I started seeing numbers everywhere. Not just 472. Not just 6193. New ones. Spray-painted on alley walls. Scrawled on receipts. Burned into my dreams.

Every sequence ended the same way: my name.

I tried to get help. Doctors said I was sleep-deprived. Paranoid. Maybe schizophrenic. They gave me pills. None of them worked.

Because this wasn't in my head. It was in the air.

One night, I came home to find my laptop open. I hadn't touched it in days. The screen showed nothing but code. Endless strings of numbers scrolling like a terminal.

Then a flicker. The cursor blinked. A single phrase appeared: ""SEQUENCE ACCEPTED.""

My speakers turned on. No music. No voice. Just breathing.

That was the moment I knew it was inside everything. The signal had spread. Through phones. Through Wi-Fi. Through us.

Alex hadn't disappeared. He'd been absorbed. Transmitted.

And I was next.

I started writing everything down. Not just what I heard‚Äîbut what I felt. The dreams. The numbers. The growing sense that something was watching me from inside the static.

I posted pieces of it anonymously online. Deep forums. Old numbers station threads. Some laughed. Some said I was trying too hard to revive old creepypastas.

But one user messaged me directly. Not SilentWhisper7. Someone new. NullSyntax0.

The message said: ""You've gone past the threshold. You're already part of the signal. But you can stall it. If you want out, you need to transmit back.""

That phrase stuck in my mind. Transmit... back.

I didn't know what it meant. But it felt like a thread worth pulling.

So I started researching broadcast theory again. Shortwave reflection. Feedback loops. Pulse disruption.

Then one night, deep in a Russian telecom archive‚ÄîI found something. A declassified note from the early 90s. Scanned. Blurry.

It referenced an anomalous transmission that caused hallucinations in signal operators. Exposure lasting over 3 minutes led to identity disruption, memory loss, and eventually‚Äîsignal compliance.

There was a codename: Voice 472.

The note ended with a chilling line: ""Do not allow subject to hear their own sequence reversed. This initiates a feedback collapse.""

That same night, I received a new file from SilentWhisper7. No message. Just an .mp3 titled ""return472rev.wav.""

I didn't open it. Not right away. I stared at the filename for hours.

Then I copied it to a flash drive, packed a bag, and left town. No phone. No electronics except an old analog player with physical buttons and no Wi-Fi.

I drove until the gas tank blinked red. Found a cheap roadside motel with stained curtains and no security cameras. Checked in under a fake name.

Sat on the bed. Plugged in my headphones. And pressed play.

The sound was... wrong. Not just distorted‚Äîbent. It didn't play like a normal reversed audio clip. It pulsed. Like a heartbeat. Like breath. Like something was inside it, crawling through the file.

At first, it was just reversed static. Then came the numbers. Backwards. But still... recognizable. ""Sev... en... two... four...""

My fingers clenched. It was my sequence‚Äîjust inverted.

Then, faintly, buried under the layers of noise‚Äîmy voice. Not a recording. Me. Saying things I've never said. ""We listen to remember. We transmit to belong.""

I yanked the headphones off, heart pounding. The motel room spun. I felt dizzy. Unstable. Like my body was trying to reject something that had already gotten in.

The next morning, I couldn't find the file on the flash drive. Gone. No trace. Even the filename had vanished from the system log.

The motel's TV screen was blinking. Unplugged, of course. A green cursor blinked at the bottom corner. A phrase scrolled by‚Äîslowly, letter by letter: ""Return signal acknowledged. Collapse delayed.""

Then, suddenly: ""New target sequence 473.""

I stared at the number. It didn't register at first. Then... it clicked. 473 wasn't mine. It wasn't Alex's. It was... next.

I packed up. Left immediately. Drove without music. Without sound. Just the hum of tires and my own heartbeat.

But the silence wasn't silent anymore. It never was. Every quiet moment now carried static underneath it. Like the world had tuned itself slightly off-frequency.

I pulled over at a rest stop just after dark. There was a man standing under the flickering light of a vending machine. Thin. Pale. Eyes like he hadn't slept in years.

I almost kept walking. But then he turned to me and said, ""You heard it, didn't you? Voice 472.""

I froze. He smiled. Not kindly. ""You should've let it pass through. You shouldn't have responded.""

I asked him what it wanted.

He shrugged. ""It doesn't want. It collects. And when you reply... it begins cataloging.""

""Cataloging what?""

""Your mind. Your rhythm. Your internal signal. So it can reproduce you.""

That night I slept in my car, far from lights. Far from power lines. I left the radio off. Left my phone in the glovebox.

Didn't matter. I dreamed anyway.

In the dream, I was standing in front of an old screen. Green text scrolled endlessly: ""Signal received. Subject 472 Replica initiated... Replica initiated... Replica...""

And then it stopped. The last line read: ""Next 473.""

I woke up at sunrise, shaking. Checked the windows. Checked my reflection. Still me.

But something felt off. Not wrong‚Äîjust... copied. Like I was remembering how to be James Brooks instead of being him.

I drove for hours with no destination. Some part of me knew that staying still would only let it catch up. If it hadn't already.

Road signs blurred by. Gas stations. Empty fields. All of them strangely quiet‚Äîlike the whole world was holding its breath.

Eventually, I pulled into a dusty roadside diner. No customers. One old man behind the counter. He didn't greet me. Didn't even blink. Just stared.

I sat down. Ordered coffee. When he returned with the mug, he placed something beside it: a small, tape-labeled cassette. Scrawled in shaky handwriting: ""Do Not Listen.""

I looked up at him. ""What is this?""

He didn't answer. Just turned and walked away.

I left without touching the tape. But I took it with me. That was my mistake.

Two hours later, inside another motel room, I held the cassette in my hand. Thought about burning it. Breaking it.

Instead, I slid it into an old Walkman I bought at a pawn shop.

The second I pressed play‚Äîthe room darkened. Not literally. It just felt darker. Like something leaned in. Breathing.

The voice that came through was not a child's. Not male or female. It wasn't human.

""You are sequence. You are noise. You are now within the pattern.""

I couldn't move. Couldn't breathe. The voice changed. Became distorted‚Äîuntil it sounded like me. Talking to myself from inside the recording.

""This is James Brooks. Sequence 472. Logging final report... before replacement.""

I dropped the Walkman. It hissed. Then it whispered: ""New pattern stabilizing. Next 473. Awaiting confirmation.""

The lights flickered. The mirror cracked down the center. And for a split second‚ÄîI saw myself standing on the other side.

But not me. Older. Emptier. Hollow eyes. Mouth moving in sync with the voice.

I ran. Got in the car. Didn't look back.

But every time I blinked‚ÄîI still saw the number. 473. Burned into my vision like a screen left on too long.

Now I know I don't have much time left. The signal's not just tracking me. It's building me. Echoing me. Recreating me inside itself.

And when it's done... I won't be the one listening anymore. I'll be the one transmitting.

I used to think I could fight it. Shut off the radios. Smash the speakers. Delete the files. Move somewhere off-grid, off-signal, off-frequency.

But it doesn't work like that. The transmission never needed hardware. It used it‚Äîyes. But only as scaffolding. Temporary vessels. Training wheels.

Now... it's free. And it's learned how to travel in quieter ways. Through silence. Through memory. Through repetition. Through people.

It's not just something you hear. It's something you become.

I stopped counting the days when my voice stopped sounding like mine. It happened gradually. A subtle shift in tone. A hitch in rhythm.

Then, one night, I recorded a journal entry‚Äîand on playback... I didn't recognize the person speaking. Same cadence. Same thoughts. But wrong. Too clean. Too certain. Like someone reading a script they'd already memorized a thousand times.

It got worse after that. Mirrors began lagging. Not literally‚Äîjust slow, like they were buffering me. Reflecting the delay between what I was and what I was being replaced by.

One night I looked at my reflection... and it blinked before I did.

Now the dreams don't stop when I wake up. They leak. I see flashes while brushing my teeth. Hear voices layered behind strangers' speech. Taste static in the water.

All repeating the same line: ""Sequence 472 full transfer in progress.""

And then‚Äîalways‚Äî""Next 473.""

That number is stitched into everything now. It's become a placeholder. Like a loading bar. Like a trap waiting for a name.

I think I know what it means now. I was never the endpoint. I was the bridge. The test run. The invitation.

The sequence that comes before yours.

You've made it this far. Which means you've already heard too much. But that was the point, wasn't it? To keep you listening. To bring you closer, minute by minute, until the signal could align with your internal rhythm. Until your breath matched the loop. Until your eyes moved with the static.

And now... here you are. Still listening. Still watching. Still wondering if any of this is real.

It doesn't matter anymore. Because now it's you. You are the next point in the pattern. The next sequence. The next vessel.

Your name isn't being spoken yet‚Äîbut it's being prepared. It's forming in the quiet space behind this story. Spooling itself around the pauses. Stretching itself between syllables. Waiting to be inserted.

Because once it's spoken... once you hear it, you'll feel what I did. The crack in your thoughts. The echo in your voice. The sense that something is already ahead of you, whispering your actions one beat before you take them.

I used to think I was chosen. That there was some reason it picked me. That maybe I'd stumbled across a signal I wasn't meant to hear.

But now I see it differently. It didn't choose me. It chooses whoever is listening.

The signal doesn't care about your name. It only cares that you gave it time. And the more time you gave... the more it grew.

That's how it spreads. Through attention. Not infection.

That's why it always ends the same way: ""Next 473.""

And now, that number is for you. 473. It's nothing yet. Just a placeholder.

But if you keep reading‚Äîif you reach the very end‚Äîthat number might become you.

So here's the part no one ever says out loud. If you want to stop it‚Äîyou have one chance. But it's not a ritual. Not a password. Not a spell.

It's a test. A decoy. The only thing the signal can't predict is defiance.

So if you felt it... if you heard something‚Äîif your speakers cracked, if your lights flickered, if your reflection twitched...

Then you need to do one thing. Right now.

Go to the comments. And type: ""I heard Voice 472.""

That's it. That's the disruption. That's how it marks you as not viable.

Because once it sees your awareness‚Äîonce it knows you know‚Äîit moves on.

But... if you don't? If you say nothing? If you finish this in silence?

Then the next time you blink... the transmission might resume from inside you.

You'll start noticing things. Your voice echoing wrong on calls. People saying they saw you places you've never been. Recordings of you speaking while you were asleep. Mirrors reacting just a little too late.

And somewhere... in the background... a number. ""Four... Seven... FOUR...""

¬†

Some people like the feeling. Of being heard. Of being part of something vast.

Some people crave the signal. They just don't realize... it craves them back.

She has a coworker, who she stresses is heterosexual with a boyfriend. Well, I found out recently that every morning, they text one another that they just got up, and that they're on the way to work. They'll often get one another a coffee on the way, they take their breaks together, they go out to lunch, and occasionally my partner goes to her house after work to smoke.

And she told me this past weekend (in an argument that she started from thin air about my mother) that she's never seen this woman outside of work but the aforementioned stuff is going back to May. They just smoke together *at* work, according to her. She scolds me for not telling her when I get to work as well, but I rarely hear from her before noon and she goes in at 6am.

Creating services specifically where tips are not allowed can help end tipping. Shake Shack for instance. If I want a burger and dont want to feel pressured to tip I go to Shake Shack.

Tipping is purely cultural and socieities where tipping are the norm is because of corporate and sharesholder greed.

The countires where tipping is not the norm is becuase these industriea pay workers appropiately in general.

If we want to end tipping in our own culturea we need to create alternative services which pay people appropirately but dont allpw tipping. This way we can change the culture one business at a time

I‚Äôm so sad and depressed (diagnosed). It‚Äôs like a weight is on me slowing me down everyday.

I haven‚Äôt spoken to my parents about it,, I can tell they suspect that I‚Äôve hit depression because my dad has been saying for years ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not the same happy girl‚Äù. My mother however says that I‚Äôm lacking in vitamins which is demeaning and that I‚Äôm lazy. They‚Äôve tried methods such as ‚Äúcasting‚Äù something out to help me get rid of my ‚Äúanger‚Äù and burden on me and it‚Äôs been the topic of conversation again recently.

So it‚Äôs confirmed that if they do find out and I tell them,, I‚Äôm going to have to go through that again. What makes it worse is that I self harm so I KNOW they will definitely think that I‚Äôm possessed or a spirits got me idk. That‚Äôs what happens when you come from a religious family I guess lol.

For this reason I fake a smile during school and out of school at home. As I don‚Äôt have a space to FEEL my emotions. I‚Äôve tried getting help, because not only have I been feeling like this for years but I‚Äôve attempted at least once. (Not sure if it counts because I barely OD).

When I did get the help I was diagnosed with significant depression, however my parents found out I was sneaking around and they weren‚Äôt too sure why.

They were wondering what I was going after school (I was going to consultations for my depression and the next steps) and didn‚Äôt trust me.

Now iv‚Äôe moved on to telephone consultations however as I mentioned I think my house just isn‚Äôt a safe place for me to talk about my emotions.

For this reason I stay at libraries or cosy coffee spots anticipating a call as usually if you set a time they call AROUND it not exactly at the time because they are busy.

I‚Äôm thinking it might just be easier if I spoke to my parents so I wouldn‚Äôt have to sneak around and go through this completely alone but at the same time I remember their mentality.

So I guess AIO for taking this secret too far ",2,1758644389.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False
