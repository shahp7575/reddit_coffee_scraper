1iuuh4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1iuuh4g/how_can_i_push_to_open_a_concealed_wood_table_top/,How can I push to open a concealed wood table top if the edges are mitered?,"I'm dealing with an issue that is perplexing me. I have a small coffee table lid which is more or less, concealed. It turns into a lift up table with hinges inside, however there is NO lip to grab onto so you can pull it up. The edges are concealed and sit inside the box area resting on a miter joint. Because it is mitered, I am unable to move the lid down at all to engage a push to open latch that I want to install.

There are 2 options I can think of. 

1) Make the closed latch position sit proud about 1/8th "", which would lift the lid just enough for it not collide with the mitered wall it fits in, however this would ruin the 'concealment' because you would see a tiny gap all around the table lid.

2) Flip the push to open latch upside down, and then engage the mechanism by pushing a button beneath the table. I like this idea, but would need to drill out some holes under the table ledge.

  
I'm open to ideas, but I think option 2 is best, just not quite sure how to make the button system work. Perhaps all I need is a bit of matching wood and glue it to the latch button to make lit flush and blend in with the underside.

Part 2: The Morning Whisper

The next morning, sunlight streamed through the windows of their Saudi home, casting a golden haze over the quiet rooms. Jr woke early, his mind still buzzing from the F1 day‚Äîthose secret snapshots of Georgina‚Äôs big ass in those leather leggings etched into his teenage brain. The house was silent, Cristiano Sr. still away, leaving Jr alone with his restless thoughts.

He stayed in bed, phone in hand, scrolling back to those forbidden photos. The sight of her curves reignited that familiar heat, puberty‚Äôs pull tugging him under. With the door cracked slightly, he didn‚Äôt think twice‚Äîprivacy felt assured in the stillness. He started jerking off again, his breath hitching as he muttered to himself, voice low but fervent. ‚ÄúFuck, her big ass is so sexy‚Ä¶ so perfect, so round. I wanna fuck it so bad, just grab it and‚Äî‚Äù His words trailed into a groan, lost in the fantasy, his hand moving faster as he pictured her leather-clad figure bending before him.

Unbeknownst to Jr, Georgina was up too, padding down the hall with a mug of coffee in hand. She‚Äôd been mulling over the bathroom clue from the race, her amusement still tinged with curiosity about his antics. As she passed his room, his hushed voice leaked through the gap in the door‚Äîraw, explicit, unmistakable. *‚Äú‚Ä¶so sexy‚Ä¶ wanna fuck it so bad‚Ä¶‚Äù* Her steps faltered, eyes widening as she caught the gist. She froze, piecing it together‚Äîhis obsession with her ass, those sneaky moments at the track. A smirk tugged at her lips, but she stayed silent, listening just long enough to confirm her hunch.

Thinking fast, she moved down the hall and deliberately dropped her mug‚Äînot hard enough to shatter, but loud enough to clatter against the tile. The noise echoed through the house, a sharp *clank* that snapped Jr out of his haze. ‚ÄúShit,‚Äù he hissed, yanking his shorts up and scrambling to hide his phone under the pillow. Heart pounding, he bolted out of his room to check the sound, leaving the door ajar.

Georgina waited a beat, then slipped into his room, her curiosity overriding caution. The bed was rumpled, the pillow askew‚Äîand there, peeking out, was his phone, still unlocked. She plucked it up, tapping the screen, and there they were: those photos from the F1 day, her big ass in leather leggings, zoomed in and shamelessly captured. Her breath caught, a mix of surprise and wry understanding flashing through her as she stared at his so-called private stash, the evidence of his morning obsession laid bare.

Come take a peek? :3,"Hello everyone üíï I'm going to be doing a special bundles sale!! I thought of doing this because I thought it would be fun and I had a great time making these bundles. üòä

To anyone who buys these, thank you!! You are supporting someone right now whose been job hunting for two months and appreciates any sale big or small!! üôè

PayPal g/s only! Buyer pays shipping costs! This time around I will ask for a small amount of help for packaging because I've run out. This will be bubblers that are 2$! 

Regarding the bundles: They're all samples that are gently used, most new, some sniffies(some decants with handwritten labels) here and there and each bundle features one fullsize in it's original bottle.

I will list an example of a scent you will be receiving (the fullsize and one sample sneak peak as well as listing notes in the bundle) 

We have four themes, and you are only paying for the fullsize, not the samples!! These are well worth over 30-50$ per bundle but I wanted to have fun with this and see these go quickly ü•∞ These are also going to come with some exciting freebies themed with the set!

Enchanted Forest Traveler - 

This bundle is for those who love grounding scents, that bring you deep into a forest or soaring through cloudy skies through a wizards castle. It's a bundle that reminds me of sitting by the window, smoky incense sticks burning, reading a book, or planning your next looting of the treasures found in dark faerie realms deep inside a dangerous forest.
The star of the show, Mystic Reverie Lilac and Pine, Featuring brand new Fantome samples of Kyuu Kohi (and another sample that's a secret) and I also threw in AC Forest Maiden (partial fullsize original bottle)! This bundle has a total of 11 samples and 2 moderate Fullsizes and one sniffie. There are EDPs and oils! Notes include: fresh, earthy, atmospheric, citrus, coffee, incense, smoke and berries. This bundle is 25$ plus shipping! 

Bubble Goddess - 

The main attraction here is 30ml Angel Soiree by Le Monde Gourmand! She smells like an angel with long flowing hair who just took a bath--surrounded by pink fluffy clouds and a refreshing cool breeze. She dresses in a white satin gown and styles pastel pink puffy/fuzzy heart earrings ‚ú® A sample in this bundle worth mentioning is Fairy Fountain by AOE! This bundle is predominantly fresh, sweet, bubbly, floral, cute and ethereal. There are a total of 12 samples (EDPs and oils) aside from the showstopper! This bundle is 27$ plus shipping!

I'm A Spooky Cutie, Raaa!- 

Here we have a fullsize 10 ml EDP Roller --brand new Friday The 13th by Zelda's Cauldron, which is a nastolgic and cozy campfire toasted marshmallows and vanilla scent. We also have Kuidaore by Fantome in this bundle (brand new samples, not used!) and a special Kyse sample in here as well!! This bundle is for those who want to drip in sweets, whether your in the mood for something fancy, juvenile or moderately playful. It's like a cozy nighttime movie night watching scary movies with your friends in the Fall, and someone's making punch with zesty fruits (and one friend spiked it without anyone looking hehe). This has a total of 12 samples (some sniffies), and has orange/apricot fruity, vanilla and gourmand notes, EDPs and indie oils! This bundle is 25$ plus shipping!

I'm That Bi*ch üíï - 

Taking the main stage is 5ml Black Cherry Bomb by Death and Floral. This is the kind of cherry that's rich, sweet and definitely a little bit naughty. An honorable mention in this bundle is CocoaPink Black Kittens 3ml jumbo oil! This bundle has a total of 8 extra samples (all full, no sniffies!) and is for those who love the idea of a rainbow assortment of fruity gourmands, rich, potent and full of magic! This bundle is for those that crave novelty, richness and sass, picture someone in combat boots with raspberry and black hair, making potions with pulp fruits or spilling wine in euphoria parties. Notes in here include blueberry, orange, soda, sultry cherries, blackberry, pomegranate and more! If red, pink, black and purple were smells, it would be this bundle!! This bundle is 25$ plus shipping!!!

Throughout the whole day I've been anticipating this moment; however, we had lab in different rooms and I didn't see her (I even went up to her room, but she went home already), which has really been bugging me.

I've never texted her before, so I would like your advice on whether I should should wait (three more agonizing ;) days) until monday before I see her in person and ask her for some coffee/lunch after class in person or if I should text her, telling her how I do think she's very cute and I've been meaning to ask her if she would be open to have some lunch with me sometime.


I feel like the first option is far more personal and courageous; but again, I've waited far too long and the last days we've been very awkward around each other, where one moment in class we have eye contact and smile to each other, bc we both know there is something, but then when standing next to each other, both of us get awkward and act like there isn't so I desperately want to know...

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Valuing it at around \~$130 but think and easy trade would be for a FS ETB.

Also have a Next Destinies booster up for sale for $75. Would also be down to put both towards a FS booster box or hidden fates ETB if there's someone who's interested in that. Can layer in PayPal as needed.

You might have expected to walk in the door and find Albert Camus pulling faces at Jean-Paul Sartre in a vain attempt to make him smile. You wouldn't have expected to find Hogarth Stone pulling faces at everything around him in a vain attempt to make sense of an environment he was clearly unaccustomed to and found visibly unnerving. Broker couldn't help but be amused. ""It was *you* who insisted on somewhere discrete, and I'm pretty sure nobody's watching us.""

""I'm pretty sure there was someone watching me coming into this shithole,"" he said, checking outside the window.

""This might be a bit more downtown than you're used to but it's hardly Magritte Street, so try to relax, will you?""

""I'll relax when you tell me what this all about, Broker..."" He paused while the proprietress gave him a blank stare and served him a cappuccino he backed away from as if it was bomb about to go off. ""This had better be worth it, that gypsy bitch gives me the creeps.""

""Trust me,"" said Broker.

""I haven't survived this long in politics by trusting journalists.""

""You know, journalists and politicians have a very symbiotic relationship, these days - times have changed.""

""So I've heard. Every day I get a hand-delivered memo with a new list of words I can't say any more for fear of you vultures swooping down off your politically correct perches. I thought you guys were meant to defend freedom of speech, not...""

""This is Joe K,"" interjected Broker, keen to stop the blustery MP before he went on to deliver the full lecture. K suspected that it wasn't the first time the journalist had received this particular brand of criticism from the so-called anti-woke brigade.

""Who is? Oh... what can I do for you, Mr K?""

""Well, I've been arrested...""

""...Have you tried the council?... Did you say 'arrested'? What the fuck, Broker? Do I look like some bleeding-heart liberal snowflake to you? I'm all about law and order, keeping the streets safe for the honest, hard-working people of Glowbridge. I'm tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime, which is criminals, in case you've forgotten, and what do you bring me? - a fucking criminal!"" Fearing he may have gone too far, Stone straightened his tie and glanced around the coffee house to determine if there were any potential voters within earshot of this outburst. There was just one man in a booth in the far corner, who looked old enough to have voted for Winston Churchill. He was bent over the table at an almost impossibly acute angle, struggling to complete the crossword in the local paper, *The Afterglow*, with the help of a large magnifying glass.

Interestingly, not only did Stone have no concern for any offence he might have caused K, but neither did K. It was as if his own member of parliament's personal opinion of him mattered so little that it was impossible to pay it even the slightest bit of attention, let alone be offended by it. Of course, it's impossible to be genuinely offended by someone whose opinions you have no respect for and genuinely having no respect for someone's opinions is easily the most effective way to offend *them* \- or at least disarm them.

""Do you know *why* he was arrested?"" said Broker. Hogarth Stone sighed.

""'The source of every crime is some defect of the understanding, or some error in reasoning, or some sudden force of the passions', Thomas Hobbes said that. Do either of you know who Thomas Hobbes was?""

""I know he had the reasoning of Caligula,"" said Broker. ""Jean-Jacques Rousseau said that.""

""I know he was fond of his dram,"" said K. ""Monty Python said that.""

""Do you know what crime he was arrested for?"" said Broker, determined to get the conversation back on track.

""No, of course not, how could I?""

""Well, neither do I, and neither does he. But do you know why he *might* have been arrested?"" The clueless look on Stone's face perfectly summed up why, in thirty years, he'd only ever managed to brown-nose his way to the outer fringes of the cabinet and was beginning to fear his ultimate destiny of wasting away the rest of years on the back benches. ""Let me ask you a different question - what's the police's biggest problem at the moment?""

""Protesters!"" said Stone, with the conviction of a man who knows he's always right. ""The law's gone soft on them and they're getting away with murder - literally.""

""*Literally*?"" said Broker. He looked at K, keen for him to make a small, but only ostensibly significant, contribution to proceedings. ""What do you think?""

""Knife crime?... Violence against women?...""

""Think more logistically.""

""...Manpower?""

""...Yeah, probably, but their biggest, and most unnecessary... pain in the arse... is the office of national statistics. They can barely get through the week without some story in the media highlighting the latest stat proving systemic racism, sexism or some other form of inherently discriminatory practices.""

""That's a load of nonsense, Broker, I happen to be good friends with a number of high ranking police officers and you can take it from me - the police are *not* racist.""

""Probably not, but, like Joe has helpfully pointed out, they are understaffed. They're also underfunded, underappreciated and under increasing pressure to meet targets, both in solving crime and recruiting more women and ethnic minorities, agreed? And on top of all that there's the stats. So I'll you ask you again, why *might* Joe have been arrested?""

""Shit... I know they're being forced to employ underqualified applicants - off the record, of course - but I can't believe it's gone this far... are you telling me that Joe was arrested for sake of statistics?""

""He *might* have been. Let's look at what we do know - (1), it was the last day of the month, (2), no one knows why he was arrested, (3), he's one extra digit in the 'white' column, (4), he's one extra digit in 'male' column, (5), he's one extra digit in the 'heterosexual' column, (6), he's a complete social outcast, and (7), he's a complete social media outcast. Why are the last two relevant? The only reason we know about Joe is because he went viral, in spite of this, giving us (8), the distinct possibility of a whistleblower inside the police, which, in itself, gives us (9), the distinct possibility of there being other lonely, straight, white men who have been used in the same way.""

""How many losers like this can there be out there?""

""It's hard to say, they're invisible, that's the point.""

""Those left-wing media motherfuckers, undermining law and order for the sake of their bullshit equality agenda.""

""So, can you ask a question in the chamber? - 'I have a constituent blah blah blah it pains me how this hard-working man blah blah blah...', make yourself known as the go-to-guy on this - there could be a lot of media attention when the time comes, putting you in the perfect position to make your move."" Stone's eyes lit up as if he was already getting a new suit fitted for his national television interview with those left-wing media motherfuckers, but he was planning more than that.

""Yes... this could be exactly the vehicle I need to make my getaway. The party hierarchy would be too afraid to do anything except deny it, and when it all comes out they'll appear as soft as the other lot. What are *you* going to do, Broker?""

""Carry on digging around, see if can track down our local whistleblower, and widen the search for any other white heterosexual males who may have been targeted in this way.""

""You won't be blaming the police, will you? they're the ones being put under this ridiculous pressure. They're the real victims in all this.""

""They certainly are... and Joe, of course.""

""Joe, yes, of course, ordinary Joe - hey, that could work, we should write that down. You're not an immigrant are you?""

""Huh?... I fail to see what difference it makes but no, I was born in Britannia. Glowbridge, in fact, if that makes you feel any better,"" said K, half-wishing he had at least some foreign ancestry in his bloodline, if only to make this pompous old bigot lose interest in his case. He may be a nihilist but he'd still managed to inherit some basic moral values from his parents. The meeting wasn't going exactly like Broker said it would when he'd outlined the benefits of having someone like Hogarth Stone on board and, now that he'd actually met him, and in spite of having no more than a voyeuristic interest in modern politics, he found himself feeling specifically guilty for the first time since he'd been arrested. More than guilty, in fact - almost... dirty.

""As long as you're Britannian... enough, and ethnically..."" The look on K's face must have prompted Stone to address the rest of these important questions to Broker instead. ""No history of racism? sexism? homophobia? antisemitism?... what are the other ones?""

""No history of anything, he's a blank page.""

""I have to be sure, Broker, that sort of thing doesn't play well these days... Rape?""

""I thought you'd quit.""

""Him, you pleb... not even one of those new soft-rapes? Or any of the old harmless shenanigans they make such a big deal out of these days?... Well, I'll have to do my own background check, of course, but, if everything works out, this might persuade a couple of nervous swimmers to take the plunge. A solo defection is good but a small exodus lead by yours truly - that would really shake things up.""

""And put you in a much more powerful position, of course.""

""Of course.""

""And a question in the chamber?""

""There *are* no questions in the chamber, Broker, only preprepared statements that sound like questions, followed by preprepared statements that sound like the answers to different questions. Nothing important ever happens in the house of commons, don't you know that yet? You're a sportswriter, Broker, and politics is not cricket. Now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, I have to be at the Wellington Club for afternoon tea, so...""

""Any chance I can tag along?"" asked Broker, ever mindful of any opportunity to widen his circle of influential friends.

""Sorry, old bean, it's uh... no guests allowed today. I'll be in touch soon, though, and we'll go for a drink, put our heads together and work out a clear strategy going forward. The timing is all important, here. We need to release just enough facts to make me look righteous and fearless, wait for the backslash, then follow up with more facts that confirm I was right all along. That way, I end up looking smart and the party end up looking stupid."" He quickly shook their hands and made a swift escape from the Black Bottom, eager to swap a wooden seat, a cappuccino and a photograph of Miles Davis for a red leather chair, an earl grey, and a portrait of Margaret Thatcher.

Why did I agree to this? K wondered. *Did* I agree to this? After serendipitously making Broker's acquaintance and, even more serendipitously, acquiring his assistance, it seemed as if he was getting some control of the situation but, paradoxically, like he was losing the ability to determine his own destiny, years after he'd felt any particular need to do so. As far as K was concerned, he had an unwritten contract with the outside world, stipulating a shared custody of literature and minimal contact between both parties - it wouldn't bother him and he wouldn't bother it. This ceasefire had long proved mutually beneficial, so why had the world reneged on their agreement? Why had it suddenly turned aggressive? And why was his only chance to reach a new settlement in the hands of some privileged prehistoric pratt of a politician?

""OK, I know he's a twat,"" said Broker, performing the least impressive mind-reading trick of all time. ""But without him I'm just pissing in the wind. With him, I'm pissing with a windbag."" The expression on K's face told the journalist that if he wanted to assail K's obviously mounting doubts, he would have to do better than that, so, since they'd briefly discussed the death of Stephen Hawking while waiting for Stone, he thought he'd try an analogy that would appeal to him. ""You know that big ring they've got in Switzerland, where they smash two particles together and all these new particles fly out in every direction?""

""The Large Hadron Collider.""

""Yeah, that's it. Well, look at it this way - he's an electron and I'm a positron and all the new particles flying off are the journalists and politicians who will...""

""What particle am I?""

""Is one of them a neutrino?""

""Yeah, that might work... I'm not sure about the rest of your analogy, though. Electrons and positrons aren't hadrons, they're leptons, and I'm pretty sure that if you smash them together they just annihilate each other.""

""It's a fucking terrible analogy, I should stick to sport... OK, try this - your case is a tennis ball that's been bouncing around social media and not really going anywhere. I just hit it into the political arena where it'll bounce around a bit more until a powerful forehand smashes it into the mainstream media - centre court - where it has the potential to attract other balls and, before you know it, we've got...""

""A load of balls.""

""A national scandal."" K wasn't sure he liked the idea of being in the middle of a national scandal. If his goal was to get the outside world to cease its hostilities against him and agree to a new peace settlement, dangling his balls around on the front line didn't exactly strike him as a particularly smart move. But, really, what did *he* know?",1,1740153385.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

We are the collective.,"For the last few weeks, like many of you, I have been caught in a current of media and information as the administration dishes out executive orders designed to strip us of our rights and freedoms. They are attempting to dismantle the foundation of our government so rapidly that it becomes difficult to keep track of what is happening‚Äîhoping, at some point, that you will surrender under the weight of their relentless attacks on our psyche.

Would you willingly grant them access to your mind if they asked you personally?

Safeguard your mind. It is your most precious resource in this fight. And this is a fight‚Äîa marathon, not a sprint. Create space in your mind for moments of calm and creativity, because these will bring clarity when you need it most.

I‚Äôm here to remind you of your significance in this story as it unfolds. The smallest actions can ripple outward, cultivating growth and unity in our communities. It is in these very acts that we begin to see the interconnectedness waiting to be harnessed‚Äîthe thread that weaves through all of us and the natural world.

We are all connected.

Now, more than ever, we must create spaces for safety and vulnerability, where we can express our shared human experience. We are a collective of stories being woven together at this very moment. Find ways to foster creativity and collaboration. Share your vision of what could be with others.

We are the light we so desperately wish to see reflected in our governing institutions. But that light does not come from them‚Äîit comes from us. It is up to us to plant the seeds of hope.

Follow the thread.
Find each other.
Speak your truth.
Others will follow.

Storytelling has a beautiful way of making room for empathy and connection. After all, we are all human. And what is it that truly sets us apart from those in power?

Our humanity.

Do not let them strip you of your humanity.

It can feel overwhelming to imagine how you, alone, can create change. But imagine yourself among a collective‚Äîeach of us stepping forward, together.

Follow the thread. Take action.

Use social media as a tool for organizing, spreading awareness, and mobilizing for the movement.
Create art. Hold the mirror to society. Use them as powerful tools of resistance.
Host meet-ups. Gather in coffee shops, community centers, and living rooms. Brainstorm new ways to weave us together.
Tell your story. Share moments from your life when everything aligned perfectly to create a deep human connection. Our stories are our power.
You cannot silence us. We are unifying. We are the collective.

I've been trying to get help for it for awhile now, but I'm on a waiting list and progress is basically halted.

I'm curious if dropping caffeine is having a negative effect on my ADHD. I know caffeine is supposed to help ADHD in a milder way than stimulants, but I'm just looking for ways to improve and this could be something.

For me, I had a lot of trouble adjusting to a life that didn‚Äôt move at the speed of a New York professional.  It‚Äôs all I knew and didn‚Äôt know how to adjust in a Covid World.

The book that helped me the most was The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck by Mark Manson.   It was a humorous way for me to start seeing a different perspective on change and adjustment to improve mental health.  I was pretty mad at the world then.  This helped me to laugh at myself and my woes to give a me boost to address it.  

Funny thing is that I noticed other people reading it too at the beach and the coffee shop (in Bali).  Looked like a very popular read for other solo travelers

i've only been tracking my calories for just over a week - clocking an average of 1482 per day. I feel pretty good about myself, excited for the journey ahead - however long it may be! hoping to be down to 200 before i have to be a bridesmaid in my friends' wedding in June. feels totally possible, especially once i start adding consistent cardio in.

i was talking to my husband the other night about how excited i was to eat *well.* since i haven't been just gorging myself on chips, or fruit snacks, or candy, or desserts, i have more room for really yummy food - he made cheeseburger from scratch on Wednesday night and i *savored it.* i didn't scarf it down because it tasted good - i ate slow, because it *tasted amazing.*

he he also made shepherd's pie last night, and the same thing. it was amazing, and i took my time with it - and, it fit right into my calorie goal. i did end up going over that night by about 100 (some nerd clusters and a cup of creamered-coffee, hehe) but not from bored binge-eating.

i pray this kind of joy finds us all on this sub, eating to *live* and not living to eat. we got this!!!

The meeting wasn't going exactly like Broker said it would when he'd outlined the benefits of having someone like Hogarth Stone on board and, now that he'd actually met him, and in spite of having no more than a voyeuristic interest in modern politics, he found himself feeling specifically guilty for the first time since he'd been arrested. More than guilty, in fact - almost... dirty.

""As long as you're Britannian... enough, and ethnically..."" The look on K's face must have prompted Stone to address the rest of these important questions to Broker instead. ""No history of racism? sexism? homophobia? antisemitism?... what are the other ones?""

""No history of anything, he's a blank page.""

""I have to be sure, Broker, that sort of thing doesn't play well these days... Rape?""

""I thought you'd quit.""

""Him, you pleb... not even one of those new soft-rapes? Or any of the old harmless shenanigans they make such a big deal out of these days?... Well, I'll have to do my own background check, of course, but, if everything works out, this might persuade a couple of nervous swimmers to take the plunge. A solo defection is good but a small exodus lead by yours truly - that would really shake things up.""

""And put you in a much more powerful position, of course.""

""Of course.""

""And a question in the chamber?""

""There *are* no questions in the chamber, Broker, only preprepared statements that sound like questions, followed by preprepared statements that sound like the answers to different questions. Nothing important ever happens in the house of commons, don't you know that yet? You're a sportswriter, Broker, and politics is not cricket. Now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, I have to be at the Wellington Club for afternoon tea, so...""

""Any chance I can tag along?"" asked Broker, ever mindful of any opportunity to widen his circle of influential friends.

""Sorry, old bean, it's uh... no guests allowed today. I'll be in touch soon, though, and we'll go for a drink, put our heads together and work out a clear strategy going forward. The timing is all important, here. We need to release just enough facts to make me look righteous and fearless, wait for the backslash, then follow up with more facts that confirm I was right all along. That way, I end up looking smart and the party end up looking stupid."" He quickly shook their hands and made a swift escape from the Black Bottom, eager to swap a wooden seat, a cappuccino and a photograph of Miles Davis for a red leather chair, an earl grey, and a portrait of Margaret Thatcher.

Why did I agree to this? K wondered. *Did* I agree to this? After serendipitously making Broker's acquaintance and, even more serendipitously, acquiring his assistance, it seemed as if he was getting some control of the situation but, paradoxically, like he was losing the ability to determine his own destiny, years after he'd felt any particular need to do so. As far as K was concerned, he had an unwritten contract with the outside world, stipulating a shared custody of literature and minimal contact between both parties - it wouldn't bother him and he wouldn't bother it. This ceasefire had long proved mutually beneficial, so why had the world reneged on their agreement? Why had it suddenly turned aggressive? And why was his only chance to reach a new settlement in the hands of some privileged prehistoric pratt of a politician?

""OK, I know he's a twat,"" said Broker, performing the least impressive mind-reading trick of all time. ""But without him I'm just pissing in the wind. With him, I'm pissing with a windbag."" The expression on K's face told the journalist that if he wanted to assail K's obviously mounting doubts, he would have to do better than that, so, since they'd briefly discussed the death of Stephen Hawking while waiting for Stone, he thought he'd try an analogy that would appeal to him. ""You know that big ring they've got in Switzerland, where they smash two particles together and all these new particles fly out in every direction?""

""The Large Hadron Collider.""

""Yeah, that's it. Well, look at it this way - he's an electron and I'm a positron and all the new particles flying off are the journalists and politicians who will...""

""What particle am I?""

""Is one of them a neutrino?""

""Yeah, that might work... I'm not sure about the rest of your analogy, though. Electrons and positrons aren't hadrons, they're leptons, and I'm pretty sure that if you smash them together they just annihilate each other.""

""It's a fucking terrible analogy, I should stick to sport... OK, try this - your case is a tennis ball that's been bouncing around social media and not really going anywhere. I just hit it into the political arena where it'll bounce around a bit more until a powerful forehand smashes it into the mainstream media - centre court - where it has the potential to attract other balls and, before you know it, we've got...""

""A load of balls.""

""A national scandal."" K wasn't sure he liked the idea of being in the middle of a national scandal. If his goal was to get the outside world to cease its hostilities against him and agree to a new peace settlement, dangling his balls around on the front line didn't exactly strike him as a particularly smart move.

It also seems that the stains almost disappear when I scrub a lot (can see in the last pic). But I'm not sure I'll be able to scrub it in the inside.

I don't care about the looking but is it food safe? It seems it'll blend with the coffee. Is there a way to remove these stains? Maybe vinegar (I have no clue but seems to be reactive, so now, I prefer ask first).

One friend offered everyone at the table a sip of his beer. When it got to me, the table was silent. No one knows I have a problem yet, but the dead silence got to me and I said sure. I had one very small sip. 

I immediately regretted it and felt so annoyed with myself.

I can feel resistance, so I think it's making a vacuum? But despite this, almost a fifth of my water will trickle out while it steeps. This morning I filled it up to about two and three-quarters and after two minutes the water level had gone down to about two-and-a-quarter. Are there any immediate steps I can take to try and keep my coffee in the brewer while it brews? What might I be doing wrong? Do I have to grind notably finer than a pourover? I thought Alan liked his beans fairly coarse, so I don't know if that's the way, but I can't think of many other variables that might cause this other than grind size, me screwing up the vacuum, or a faulty unit.",1,1740152580.0,AeroPress,2,1.0,False
1iutujv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1iutujv/email_bomb_example_paypal/,Email Bomb Example - Paypal,"Love this community, been frequenting for years, and because of that I knew what to do when I saw I'd been email bombed.

I was finishing up filing taxes, and I needed my spouse's email address for the identity theft add-on. Went to my email to check and saw that from 9pm or so last night, I'd gotten about 500 emails. They were all 'Click the link to finish registering' and from various places like WM dot com, Plex, blue bottle coffee, Zoom (literally 200 Zoom 'enter this code' emails) all from the legit web addresses. I panicked for just one second before I was like 'This is an email bomb. Someone is trying to hide something from me.'

For those who don't know, an email bomb is when a scammer gets a hold of your email address and a compromised password or two, and want to get into that account without you knowing. Since services email you constantly these days (a blessing and curse), they know they have to hide the email notifying you. So they use some kind of script or something presumably, to sign up for or trigger a bunch of emails to your address. (most of the waves of emails all came at the exact same time. 20-30 Zoom codes all timestamped at the exact same time, humanly impossible for someone to trigger by hand)

So I carefully went through and started tapping the 'delete' key, watching the list of emails like a hawk. About 300 emails in, I found it. They'd somehow gotten into my paypal and added a phone number to it. Boom. So I went in to Paypal, changed my password (doubled the length, using random numbers, letters, etc.), and added app-based 2-factor. Crazy thing is, I had JUST gotten into my paypal earlier this morning to get a tax form, and would never have known the account was compromised. Thankfully I didn't have any money in it so I didn't lose anything.

My biggest thanks to this subreddit for discussing, highlighting, and educating about scams. I would have just 'select all, delete''d the emails had I not known what was happening to me and who knows what could have happened. I'm a careful person, I have all 3 credit bureaus frozen, my chex profile frozen, utilities profile thing frozen, but you never can be too careful because I would never have known had it not been for this place.

1iuttqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1iuttqg/how_am_i_suppose_to_feel_on_medication/,How am I suppose to feel on medication?,"Hey everyone,

I could really use some perspective because I‚Äôm feeling confused about how ADHD medication is supposed to feel. The way others describe their experiences is seriously fueling my impostor syndrome, and I guess I just need to hear from people who‚Äôve been through it.

I was diagnosed last December (ADHD combined) and started medication about a month ago. First, I tried Concerta, but I had to stop after four days because the side effects were brutal (extreme anxiety, irritability, the whole package). My clinician then switched me to Elvanse 20mg (which I assume is similar to Vyvanse), and it‚Äôs been a lot better in terms of side effects. On it, I feel kind of like I do after drinking coffee, and it helps a bit with certain tasks, but definitely not all.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs been messing with my head: that whole ‚Äúquiet brain‚Äù thing so many ADHD people talk about when trying stimulants? I just‚Ä¶ haven‚Äôt felt it. My thoughts are still overwhelming and sometimes completely paralyze me. I know everyone‚Äôs different, but it makes me feel weirdly alone, like I should be experiencing this if I really have ADHD. 

I know my diagnosis is solid. My assessment was thorough, with interviews from my mom and boyfriend, tons of clinical tests, etc. But not having that quiet brain moment makes me question everything and it scares me. I guess that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here, reaching out to this wonderful newfound community.

Has anyone else had this experience? Could it be that I just need a higher dose, or is it possible that some people just don‚Äôt get that effect from stimulants? Would really love to hear your thoughts and experiences. I might just be overanalyzing things (a classic), but I‚Äôd love to know if anyone else has felt this way.

TL;DR: Diagnosed with ADHD-C, started meds a month ago. Concerta was awful, Elvanse 20mg is better, but I don‚Äôt get the ‚Äúquiet brain‚Äù everyone talks about, thoughts still overwhelm me and I‚Äôm feeling a lot of impostor syndrome.

I felt sluggish, struggled to recover after workouts, and even my focus at work slipped. My friend suggested AgeShield, an NAD+ booster. I tried it here‚Äôs my real-life review.

# What Is AgeShield?

AgeShield is a daily supplement that claims to fight aging by boosting NAD+ levels. NAD+ (a coenzyme in our cells) helps produce energy, repair cells, and keep metabolism sharp.

 As we age, NAD+ drops, leading to fatigue and slower recovery. AgeShield uses 10 natural ingredients to replenish it.

# How Does AgeShield Work?

 I‚Äôve been taking AgeShield for a few months now, and here‚Äôs how I feel it works for me:

* **Boosts Cellular Energy:** AgeShield helps raise my NAD+ levels. NAD+ is vital for energy production in cells. I feel more energetic and less tired during the day.
* **Supports Cellular Repair:** The supplement aids in repairing cells. This makes me feel like I‚Äôm recovering faster from daily stresses. My overall wellness has improved noticeably.
* **Enhances Mental Clarity:** I‚Äôve noticed a clearer mind since I started using AgeShield. It seems to support brain function, making it easier to concentrate and stay focused.
* **Natural Ingredients at Work:** AgeShield uses a blend of vitamins and minerals that work together. These ingredients help my body function better and slow down some aging processes.
* **Easy to Include in a Daily Routine:** I simply take a capsule each day with water. This routine is simple and fits well with my busy schedule.

In short, AgeShield works by boosting energy at the cellular level, helping repair cells, and improving mental focus. I feel more active and clear-headed, which has made a big difference in my day-to-day life. Always talk to a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement.

# AgeShield Review: My Results After 8 Weeks

* **Energy Surge:**¬†By week 3, I stopped needing afternoon coffee. My workouts felt less exhausting.
* **Faster Recovery:**¬†Post-gym soreness faded quicker. Even my knee (old injury!) felt better.
* **Sharper Mind:**¬†Less brain fog. I finished tasks faster and remembered details better.
* **Skin Glow:**¬†Bonus! My skin looked less dull. My wife joked I ‚Äúreverse-aged.‚Äù

# What Other Users Say

I checked reviews before buying. Many shared similar wins

* ***Jen, 48 from*** **California*****:***¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôm a nurse with 12-hour shifts. AgeShield keeps me going without crashes.‚Äù
* ***Henri, 52 from*** **Georgia*****:***¬†‚ÄúRecovered faster after hiking trips. Even my cholesterol improved!‚Äù
* ***lara, 44 from*** **Colorado*****:***¬†‚ÄúMy focus at work skyrocketed. Plus, my hair feels thicker.‚Äù

# The Science Simplified

**NAD+ does three big things, according to research**

1. **Powers Cells:**¬†Turns food into energy (bye, fatigue!).
2. **Repairs DNA:**¬†Fixes daily wear-and-tear in cells.
3. **Protects Organs:**¬†Supports heart, brain, and nerve health.

AgeShield‚Äôs mix of plants and vitamins helps your body make more NAD+ naturally.

# AgeShield Review: AgeShield Benefits

Since starting AgeShield, I've noticed

* **Increased Energy:** I feel more energetic throughout the day.
* **Improved Mental Clarity:** My focus and concentration have sharpened.
* **Enhanced Skin Appearance:** My skin looks more vibrant and youthful.
* **Better Overall Well-being:** I feel healthier and more balanced.

* **Thiamine (Vitamin B1):** Supports energy metabolism.

# Final Verdict: AgeShield Review

AgeShield gave me back my energy and mental edge. It‚Äôs not a magic pill, but paired with good sleep and diet, I feel 10 years younger. If aging has hit your stamina or focus, try this. Just give it time!",1,1740151765.0,Supplement_Reviews_,0,1.0,False

Sometimes, stepping back reveals your real progress.



It‚Äôs 11 am. I am sitting at my desk, my body locked onto my computer screen. The silence in the air is thick and the tension is high. I am in the middle of one of my 3 hour work sessions,

Again.

I am working towards building my second online business, and I need all of the productivity I can get.

But recently, I‚Äôve felt like I am spinning my tires.¬†

‚ÄúI need more hours‚Äù I say to myself, as I break eye contact from my work for 2 seconds.

Then a text arrives.

My stomach tightens, my body raises in temperature.¬†

Do I answer it?

After all, I have worked so hard to create this distraction free workspace.

For me, my goals are non-negotiable.

I spin the idea around my head a few times until I decide to take a look.

It‚Äôs my friend Julie.¬†

She‚Äôs asking if I want to come and visit her friends in a neighbouring city.

I instinctually start typing ‚Äúno‚Äù but then I pause for a moment.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been cooped up in here for the last two weeks banging my head against the wall.‚Äù I say in my head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not making any progress anyway.‚Äù

That thought cut me deep to the soul. I felt a wave of doubt fall over me.¬†

‚ÄúIs this all even worth it?‚Äù I question.

I instantly change how I am sitting. I do this because I don‚Äôt want to allow those feelings to well up. That‚Äôs how failure is created.

‚ÄúBut I am burnt out‚Äù I say to myself. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just go and see what happens.‚Äù

I grab the phone reluctantly, and send the text to Julie that I‚Äôll go with her, mentally fighting it the whole time. Feeling like I am missing out on work others aren‚Äôt doing.

In the car on the way there, she‚Äôs her natural happy self.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with you?‚Äù She asks, noticing that I am a bit distant.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve just been working so hard and I feel like I am not getting anywhere.‚Äù I reply.

‚ÄúJust let it go for today, you‚Äôll feel better tomorrow.‚Äù She replies with a smile.

I loosen up. My face relaxes, and I crack a smile and look out the window of the gorgeous mountain scenery passing by.

We arrive to her friend‚Äôs house, and we drink delicious Colombian coffee and snacks. I feel light. I feel like I have no worries at all.

Then it comes back, that voice in my head tells me that I am wasting time, that I‚Äôll never make it.

My shoulders drop slightly, I dodge eye contact a bit more, I don‚Äôt add my piece to the conversation when I have the opportunity.

‚ÄúMy son is actually a music producer.‚Äù Her friend says, with a grin and a steaming cup of coffee in his hand.

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù I respond. ‚ÄúI am actually a singer. I‚Äôve made tons of music.‚Äù I reply.

‚ÄúWow, that‚Äôs great. You should go up and check out his studio.‚Äù He responds.

I walk up the steps, enter his room, and take a look.

His son, is a 6‚Äô2‚Äù latin boy that‚Äôs around 18. He sits at the computer like it‚Äôs a cockpit of a space ship. Speakers, pianos, all of the gadgets.

‚ÄúNice to meet you.‚Äù He says with a confident smile.

‚ÄúYou too bro.‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see what you got.‚Äù I respond with a cheeky curiosity.

He spins around in his chair, and clicks play on a track.

It‚Äôs good, but it‚Äôs just a bit bare. I hold my tongue. After all, he probably knows more than me.

Another part passes by, I have a piece I'd like to share, but I don‚Äôt.

I don‚Äôt feel like my response has merit.

A third part passes and I can‚Äôt resist.

‚ÄúHave you thought about using a harmony there?‚Äù I ask lightly, trying not to step on toes.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù He asks, with a puzzled look on his face.

‚ÄúYou take the vocal, and have the guy sing a higher note in the same scale. Then you lower the volume on that voice so it becomes a texturing effect.‚Äù I respond, as if this is common knowledge.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know that was a thing.‚Äù He responds with a smile, eyes hungry for more information.

‚ÄúYeah, all of the biggest artists layer their vocals to make them bigger and have more depth.‚Äù I add.

He pauses for a moment as if I just unlocked a core memory for him.

‚ÄúTake a look at this one.‚Äù He spins around to click play, looking for more information.

At that moment I felt like a know-it-all. I felt like I was critiquing someone‚Äôs work without them asking for it.¬†

The self-doubt crept back in.

He clicks play on the next song, and I wanted to stay quiet, but I felt safe now. I felt like he wanted to hear my opinion.

‚ÄúThis one is good, but it can use some ad-libs.‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúAd-libs?‚Äù He asks with the same puzzled look as before.

‚ÄúThey are like backing vocals. Right now there is a lot of space between words and it feels very empty. You record secondary takes and place them in the middle of the words.‚Äù I say, slowly becoming more matter-of-fact.

‚ÄúWow man, you really know a lot about this.‚Äù He says. ‚ÄúWould you be able to help us produce something one day?‚Äù He adds.

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù I say shrugging my shoulders. Still feeling like it‚Äôs not really a big deal.

His face completely changed. His smile went from ear to ear, and then we stood up to leave for dinner.

‚ÄúThanks bro. That was a huge help.‚Äù He says, giving me a high five.

Later that day, on the ride home. I started thinking.

‚ÄúMaybe I know more than I thought.‚Äù I say to myself, looking out the window of the car once again.

‚ÄúHe really learned a lot from me.‚Äù I follow up in my mind.

I arrive at home, dead tired, and fall into bed.

I crack open at 6 am the next day and it‚Äôs back to the same old routine.

But something is different.

I stand a bit taller.

When I walk down the street I feel a bit more useful.

My heart feels full.

I sit in my chair, open up my laptop, and take a look at my work from yesterday.

It‚Äôs good.

Better than I thought.

And at that moment it hit me..

It was so gung-ho on success that I was blind to my own progress.

I was so filled with self-doubt that I was robbing people of the information I have accumulated.

I lean back in my chair, take a deep breath, and decide at that moment..

1iutg38,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/1iutg38/it_happened_thrice/,It happened THRICE.,"First: I (44f) wearing a red shirt with a large design on the back while making a trip to Walmart a few years ago.  I was doing Shopkick at the time, first mistake. It's where you scan suggested products with your phone for rewards points, so I could see where the initial confusion stemmed from.  Older man stands right next to me with my little hand cart as I bend over and then, ""WHERE'S THE COFFEE?"" I slowly look up at him, meet his eye, and say the first thing that comes to mind: ""I'm wearing red?"" while motioning to my shirt. ""I'm looking for the COFFEE."" I say, ""I don't work here, but it's two aisles over"" while pointing to the left. I then quickly leave the aisle, because I was on a road trip and didn't live there.  I also didn't know where the fucking coffee was. 

Second: One day after the previous incident in an area I was camping, the West Coast of Florida. This time, a blue shirt at a Target.  ""I don't need a cart"" I said to myself as I walked around with eight items in my hand that I'm about to drop, coming from the beauty section.  Lady and baby in cart block my movement. ""Where's the baby section?"" Oh, hell no.  First, I'm childfree, so I REALLY DGAF, and second-of-ly, there is zero indication that I am an employee as I look at her, check the color of my shirt, look at my pile of shit I'm trying to not drop, and look back in her again. I say with a laugh, ""Lady, I haven't the slightest clue."" ""So you don't know?"" And laugh in her face as I backtrack and boot scoot towards the checkout.  

Third: Red shirt at Target, years later.  I should have known. I escaped the store without incident, but I'm five steps away from my bright red car, large bags in hand, when a lady rolls her basket towards me and tells me she's done with it.  I'm parked two spaces before the cart corral.  I'm watching it just sort of roll idly through the parking lot as I walk back to the vehicle WITH MY MOM. There is a Target employee currently in the corral watching her talk to me, confused because I don't work with him.  I tell her ""Okay"" and then my mom giggles with me as we get into my car.  ""So you're not going to take my basket?!"" As I back out, my Mom waves goodbye at her, and the Target employee goes to retrieve the basket while explaining to her I don't work there.  I'm pretty sure it was the same red shirt as before, with a large yellow design on the back, my hair always kept short during this time so as to not obscure a name tag.

Looking for someone to get coffee with, hike with, walk my kid's dog with (I'm not a dog or cat person but this sweet dog is an exception), build a huge friend community with and have fabulous cocktail parties with (is that still a thing?). I'm atheist, ultra liberal, but can get along with anyone.  I do math problems for fun and I feed off of other people's excitement for what they are passionate about. Being passionate about something is a beautiful thing. I have fickle, reoccurring interests in orchids, cacti, snakes, especially boa constrictors, never got over my dinosaur phase, tesla coils, glass, concrete, auroras and atmospheric plasmas, radio waves, ham radio, new wave music, rubik's cube, fountain pens and mechanical pencils. Quantum field theory, nonlinear dynamics and group theory if you swing that way.  I'm the world's last hackey sack player.

Not really looking for a girlfriend but wouldn't rule it out. The last few girls I've liked have liked girls, so... kind of a non starter. That being said, just holding hands with someone nice and interesting is amazing and electrifying, well, if I remember correctly. But I am very reserved and too afraid to make people uncomfortable to make any kind of advances. Happy to find someone just to joke around with or throw the frisbee.  I put m4r as happy to find a guy friend to hang around with, although to be clear, romantically I am only interested in women.  But this is not a primarily romantic post.  Am I over explaining?  Can't be too careful.

Tell me what you are passionate about, or passionate about today, or were interested in, and now, maybe find that interest ready to be rekindled. Today is a great day to get back into something!

You don't have to live in Tucson, happy to make friends anywhere. Feel free to try to change my mind about Tucson. I was going to move to Austin last week, but a confluence of mysterious coincidences changed my mind.",1,1740151166.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I used to have a cheap hand me down machine and used pre-ground beans in grad school. Currently I generally do French press 1-2x/day and have a grinder I received for my wedding that's now \~7 years old. Some other potentially pertinent details: I do enjoy a good latte from my local coffee shop so some form of steamer would be ideal. In my peak use of my old machine I would use it 1x/wk but it also sucked so I primarily used it to get extra caffeine via red eyes. I see this starting at a similar amount as I figure out the grinder/machine but quickly becoming more regular.

I was looking at doing a hand grinder. At minimum it would just be for espresso but as my electric grinder is on its way out I figured I would get one to do both. I have $150 to amazon and 1ZEspresso seems to be everyone's favorite so I though the X-Ultra would be the best pick for pour over + espresso: [https://www.amazon.com/1Zpresso-Grinder-Midnight-Black-Well-built-Efficiency/dp/B0CFXGGFLR](https://www.amazon.com/1Zpresso-Grinder-Midnight-Black-Well-built-Efficiency/dp/B0CFXGGFLR) . From what I've read the 1ZEspresso is the best bang for your buck regarding grinders and the X-Ultra is advertised to do both pour over and espresso.

For espresso machines I was leaning towards the Bambino Plus ( [https://www.bestbuy.com/site/breville-the-bambino-plus-espresso-machine-with-15-bars-of-pressure-and-milk-frother-stainless-steel/6302559.p](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/breville-the-bambino-plus-espresso-machine-with-15-bars-of-pressure-and-milk-frother-stainless-steel/6302559.p) ). I have about $500-550 worth of gift cards from work I can redeem to places like Best Buy,Macy's, Crate& Barrel, etc. So the Breville Infuser which seemed to be pretty highly recommended and popular is out as it's Amazon only. The bambino Plus seems like a reasonable upgrade from the bambino (especially as it's essentially free via the gift cards).

Both items fit almost exactly within what I have between the two sets of gift cards. I'm willing to spend more for both, but I'm concerned with diminishing returns with higher price points. I'm not able to spend $1k+ on a machine generally, but with the $500 gift card, buying a $600 or $700 machine costs me only $100-200 and if it makes that much more of a difference I'd be willing to consider it.

The candlelight flickered in the center, casting a golden glow against the polished wood, but it did little to warm the hollow feeling in her chest. The caf√© was alive with conversation, laughter spilling from nearby tables, but none of it reached her. She was just another lonely silhouette in a sea of connection.

She glanced at her phone‚Äî7:42 PM.

Twelve minutes late.

She swallowed down the disappointment, trying to convince herself it was fine, that he might still show up. People ran late all the time. Maybe he got caught in traffic, or maybe he was struggling to find parking. Maybe‚Äî

But she had been here before.

Too many times.

She had spent an hour picking out her dress, something soft and elegant, flattering but not desperate. Her makeup was subtle, her hair styled with care. She wanted to look nice but not as if she had tried too hard. But even as she applied the last touch of lipstick in her mirror, a part of her had whispered that it wouldn‚Äôt matter.

Because it never did.

7:55 PM. Still no messages.

She sighed, setting her phone down beside her untouched plate. The server passed by, hesitating slightly as he caught her gaze, as if debating whether to ask if she was ready to order. But he said nothing. Maybe he had seen this before‚Äîmaybe he had seen *her* before. Mira had been stood up so many times that she imagined the waitstaff at these places exchanged glances when she walked in. *There she is again. Poor thing.*

She took a sip of her coffee. It had gone lukewarm, and the bitterness settled on her tongue like the weight in her chest.

8:07 PM.

She stared at the empty chair across from her, willing it to be occupied, wishing for a presence that would never come. The messages in their chat replayed in her mind‚Äîhis enthusiasm, his promises that he was ""so excited to meet her."" But where was he now?

Why did they always do this?

Was it her?

Was she *too much*? Or maybe not enough?

She exhaled slowly, forcing herself to stand. She reached into her purse, pulled out a few bills, and left them on the table without a word. The moment her feet touched the pavement outside, the cool night air hit her like a quiet slap to the face. It smelled of rain, though the sky was clear.

The world outside moved on, indifferent to her sadness. Couples walked past her, their hands intertwined, their laughter light and easy. Groups of friends passed by, engaged in conversations she would never be a part of. She wrapped her arms around herself, feeling small, feeling invisible.

She tilted her head back and looked up.

The sky stretched above her, deep and endless, dotted with only a few faint stars barely visible against the city lights. Distant. Unreachable. Uncaring. And yet, constant.

Here is my espresso background. I have 30+ years enjoying espressos and my current tastes lean towards medium roast with both a nutty flavor and brighter notes. I do like a good dark chocolate espresso, but find that easy to pull and I am having more difficulty dialing in for the balance of depth and fruit notes. I am using fresh beans that I am familiar with. 

I have pulled about 20 espressos from my new Robot, and I am looking for some guidance. I have a Mazzer Philos Grinder (200 flat burr) and a basic understanding of coffee espresso extraction using pump driven machines and a lower priced conical grinder. This combo made shots taste, at best, like dark chocolate and were easy to dial in. 

I have used Stumptown Hairbender beans for about 15 years. Along with the occasional beans purchased from local roasters.I have found a local roaster that has medium roast beans that give me the nutty depth with some more fruit notes. These are honey washed Costa Rican beans. I was getting close with my old setup and decided to give the Robot a try with the Mazzer flat burr grinder. 

I have also spent a lot of time on Reddit and Home-barista researching the other's Robot extraction best practices. I would be interested to hear what has been working best for you.I have had my sweetest shots with 17g in and 40-42 grams out with a 5 sec PI and a 6/7 bar pull over 30-45 secs. This is with a relatively coarser grind than I have used with the pump machine. 

I keep thinking I want to go a bit finer on the ground and push a bit harder to start both the PI and the entire pull. Anytime I go to a significantly finer grind (leads to more pressure) and shorter ratios, I am getting astringency. While stronger in body, they are dry and astringent more than bitter. And there is little to no sour. They remind me of the shots that make my face cringe. Not awful, but needs some milk or sugar. 

I have decided that pre-heating the basket has not made a noticeable difference for my beans and I am using the supplied paper under the screen. My water is softened and filtered and has been good for my other machine.

1iuswdx,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1iuswdx/paper_filters_and_filtering_the_oils_in_coffee/,"Paper filters and ""filtering the oils"" in coffee","This was going to be a comment on a recent question but got kind of long, so here it goes as post.

Here's a very basic attempt made at gathering information on the web trying to find out more precisely what is happening with the different oils in our coffee when we use paper filters. It'd be awesome if experts can verify or attest to this so we reach a better conclusion (see mine at the end).

We frequently talk about paper filters removing oils (and some vendors will support this), but I think that we're simplifying the reality. What I found kind of lead me to think that we're actually not filtering much at all when it comes to oils.

**What do we actually use when filtering?**

Even if you get to think about molecule diameters of the different oily stuff in coffee, it's not just about whether the pore diameter in a filter will be smaller or bigger than that. This is because you also have to account for the pores differing in size, at which proportion and distribution does each pore size shows up in the filter, and even the filter thickness and how all this will affect flow.

Now, if you ""only"" look at *average* pore size in *some* of the filters most used for moka (because there is actually a range of options there too), you may end up with something in the range of 2.5 to 10 or 20 nm (so, a relatively big range). So what does that mean or how it represents what you *actually* get in your cup?

Well,

**What are we filtering (or trying to)?**

Now, these are the oils in your coffee along with their particle size estimation, note that actual sizes are also not known precisely (to the best that I could find, please correct me where I'm wrong) so these are estimates inferred from their structure. I marked in bold the two compounds associated with increased low density (""bad"") cholesterol: Cafestol and Kahweol. Funnily, there are studies linking these two with anti-carcinogenic effects.

|Lipid Type|Compound|Molecular/Chain Size (nm) (\*)|Properties|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Diterpenes**|**Cafestol**|**1.0**|**Raises LDL, antioxidant**|
|**Diterpenes**|**Kahweol**|**1.0**|**Raises LDL, anti-inflammatory**|
|Fatty Acids|Palmitic acid|0.8/2.3|Saturated fat, common in coffee oils|
|Fatty Acids|Linoleic acid|0.9/2.5|Essential omega-6 fatty acid|
|Fatty Acids|Oleic acid|0.9/2.4|Monounsaturated fat, also in olive oil|
|Fatty Acids|Stearic acid|0.9/2.5|Saturated fat, neutral on cholesterol|
|Fatty Acids|Myristic acid|0.7/1.8|Saturated fat, minor presence in coffee|
|Sterols (Phytosterols)|Œ≤-Sitosterol|1.2|Cholesterol-lowering plant sterol|
|Sterols (Phytosterols)|Stigmasterol|1.2|Plant sterol with anti-inflammatory properties|
|Sterols (Phytosterols)|Campesterol|1.2|Plant sterol, aids cholesterol balance|
|Volatile Aromatic Oils|Furan compounds|0.5|Contributes to coffee aroma|
|Volatile Aromatic Oils|Pyrazines|0.4|Roasted coffee aroma component|
|Volatile Aromatic Oils|Terpenes & Aldehydes|0.6|Flavor-enhancing compounds|

**(\*)** Some molecules are compact and don't form chains. Also note that molecules are not cubical, so you don't have one size but three and even that doesn't count for the actual irregular shapes.

Note that proportions of these compounds aren't shown here and will likely affect the actual outcome.

Note for caffeine: it has slightly smaller molecules than most of these lipids (0.2-0.78 nm). So you cannot filter out caffeine when brewing coffee with filters.

**My (preliminar) conclusion**

From the info that I gathered today, I conclude that paper will filter out ground fines (giving a ""cleaner cup"" strictly in this sense). A very minimal amount of some of the oils (ranging to none, potentially not enough to alter the cup), and certainly not caffeine.

This is **only information I sorted from the internet**, I'm not a scientist nor an expert, just a random that got interested in this. So please, if you have better, contradictory or confirming data, be welcome to add to the discussion so we can improve on these findings.

# 39 [M4F] #Pittsburgh - I'm a hot older guy and I WANT a dirty minded woman that isn't afraid to be raw and sexual in not so innocent ways. I'll be traveling to the area here soon to run an errand and I'd love to make a pit stop...even if your body isn't perfect I don't care just be real and fun!

>Hey curious ladies...

>I have always had a thing for unique dirty minded women. Vanilla just ain't my style. I'm a good looking man, dark hair and eyes, got a little bit of facial hair, I hit the gym 4 days a week so I'm bulky but REAL and down to earth and not a gym rat. Things down there never get complaints either. I'll try anything once, 3 times if I hate it.

>I'm taking a big chance here, but I'll be dropping my car off in Pittsburgh this afternoon/evening. I want to make a pit stop and leave something other than my car behind. I don't care what your situation is, don't want to see you again. I just want to feel alive again even if it's only for a day!

>If the post is still up, I'm still looking.

Ewwww.

# 33[M4F] #CT looking for steamy age gap fling

>Hi there :) 33 married man located in Connecticut. Lately I can‚Äôt stop thinking about having an affair with a significantly younger woman (18-22). I would love to find a local college-aged cutie to fool around with on the side. I know there are girls out there who are into married guys and older men, so I‚Äôm hoping one of you sees this :)

>Basics: 5‚Äô11‚Äù, 190lbs, white, bearded. Disease-free, vaccinated, hygienic. College-educated and employed full-time. No kids.

>What I‚Äôm Into: eating pussy is my single favorite sex act. Please sit on my face and use the contours of my nose, lips and chin as your personal sex toy. Also very into dirty talk, foreplay, outercourse, panties/lingerie, sneaky sex, and more. Group play of any kind is a major bucket list fantasy of mine. However, ultimately I‚Äôm much more into just having fun and getting each other off than I am into any specific kinks or fetishes.

>What I‚Äôm Not Into: blowing up my life, leaving my wife for you, violent or degrading sex, sellers.

>Open to all ethnicities, body types, and relationship statuses, as long as you are within that 18-22 age range (or maybe a lil older).

>Say hi üëã

Can't wait to see this guy's ads when he's in his 60s and still looking in the 18-22 range

# M4F [35] #losangeles Married. Unpopular opinion: Homemade popcorn is better than the movie theater.

>There, I said it. If you know what you‚Äôre doing, popcorn is better at home. Even without the giant paper bucket.

>Another unpopular opinion: An affair is always going to be sexier than a perfect (or imperfect) marriage.

>A little about me: well-organized, reliable, and career driven. Family oriented. Six feet tall. Energetic.

>I love deep conversations, dark humor, corny humor, going to the gym, singing, cooking, learning new skills, going all-in with hobbies, buying people gifts, conspiracy theories, writing, and physical affection.

>I look forward to hearing from anybody that this post appeals to!

WRONG...can you even *buy* artificial butter topping outside of a movie theatre? Check and mate!

I definitely read the last sentence in Borat voice.

# 68 [M4F] #Long Island/NYC - You're married (or have a live in boyfriend) or even single and your sex life is a -2 on a 10 scale. Perhaps now you should consider discreetly hooking up with an older tall in shape white male TO MAKE YOUR SEX LIFE GREAT AGAIN instead of dull and boring.

# If you want to make your sex life great again, at least read what I have to say.

>I listen to my partner. It's a two way street. You're reading this because your sex life is sub standard and you want to make your sex life great again. Generically, whether it's you sucking his cock and once he fucks you, he typically lasts 5-10 five minutes and it's over. After that he just falls asleep leaving you still craving orgasms, mad and just fed up. His oral skills are sub par and when he attempts to go down on you, he'll stop after ten minutes and then shove his cock into your mouth or hand. You remember what good sex was with one or two boyfriend, but with your husband (or even current boyfriend) you can't remember the last time you had intense orgasms.

>Regardless of what the problem is, you are typically in the mood 3-4 times per week. Besides not having orgasms, you know that he truly sucks in bed and you need a man to take care of your needs. You're probably under 45 and want to try something different and also discreet. So why not a tall in shape white male, who is very skilled, knows what he is doing, can last, can go down on your for as long as you want, can be as kinky as you want or make passionate love if that is what you desire. I'm married but an on here because many men my age are in less than desirable situations due to heath or orthopedic reasons. With me, my spouse is not sick but has back, neck and nerve issues that made it too painful to continue so she stopped. She walks fine, drives but bedroom activities become too difficult for her, I still am in really good health, no ED issue and a raging libido.

>I am 6 feet tall, 200, dad body clean shaven well educated, nonsmoker, have 2/3 of my graying black hair left, still wear size 35 regular Levis and would love to hear back. I am also very oral, thick, cut mushroom cock, nice size and I last too. I can get erect three times and finish at least twice. If I do not finish the third time I just have an erection for well over an hour which most woman enjoy. You can be any age, but I want to meet a nice lady who is comfortable with my age.

>You can be local or even someone who visits NY regularly on business and wants someone on the side to give you what you are not getting at home. While you love him, you know there is much more and he is incapable of satisfying you. If you are local I can only host at a motel and if you are married, I assume you cannot host too unless you have access to a vacant home or apartment every now and then.

We've seen this walking incarnation of ""OK Boomer"" here many times before, but I felt like this post was too short, so I've added him as a bonus. I also know in my heart of hearts that he's getting zero non-seller responses...but if he is, then I feel sorry for that person. I'd also feel sorry for him, a little, if his ad wasn't so gross.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I, 19F, converted to Orthodoxy this past summer. I started to the church in the fall of 2023 and was baptized in the summer of last year. What started as a small parish of mostly cradle-dox, with just one or two zealous converts, has now become a cesspool of alt-right young (catechumen) men who attack and crack down on anyone who they perceive to be a heretic in their eyes and spread increasingly more harmful views out in the open. 

Apart from the blatant misogyny and homophobia which has become regular coffee hour talk, one young man (and a few others, albeit in less concerning severity) actively talks about how he has talked to demons, can hear them, and how he has exorcised one. He also openly ‚Äúasked advice‚Äù on how to deal with his best friend, who was actively suicidal. In his own words, he had already told her that ‚Äúit was simply demons influencing her and that she should simply pray and ignore them.‚Äù Other members in the parish applauded him for this. That being said, they do not believe in modern psychology or even most of science. 

As someone who has struggled with several mental illnesses myself for most of my life, I am now most likely facing a several week stay in a psychiatric hospital (as soon as all the logistics are worked out) for psychotic symptoms, and a possible diagnosis on the schizophrenia spectrum. Although these symptoms didn‚Äôt start when I became Orthodox, it has *significantly* worsened since all of this started. I can no longer go to church, without being severely triggered afterwards and for several days afterwards. 

When I confided this to my Orthodox loved ones, they doubted me immediately. Telling me I should simply keep praying, that it was all just from the Enemy. Some of them did say I should go to a therapist, but refused to acknowledge that certainly Orthodoxy wasn‚Äôt helping me in this mental state. Because the problem can never be religion, right? I could‚Äôve gotten help months ago, before any of it got this bad, had I not completely gotten swept up in believing my symptoms were simply spiritual warfare and signs of demonic presence, because of what adults whom I trusted and members of my parish were telling me. 

I almost got swept up in a Orthodox-presenting cult as well, because of one of these loved ones who introduced me to them and still believes that this group and Elder will solve all my problems. So, these friendships are proving to be absolutely useless. 

It feels everything is falling apart, most of my Orthodox loved ones have turned on me or are treating me like crap, (more than) half of my parish is crazy, the priest shows absolutely no intention of stopping any of this. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can take any of this.

Chapter 1: The Algorithm in the Shadows

Elliot sat in the dim glow of his computer screen, his apartment bathed in the cold blue light of endless scrolling. The walls were bare, save for a few conspiracy-laden sticky notes and half-empty coffee cups. His job? Meaningless. His relationships? Fading. His only escape was the digital abyss‚Äîthe forums, the archives, the whispers buried beneath layers of encryption.

He had always been a seeker, digging through the internet‚Äôs underbelly for some hidden truth. Ghost cities, black budget projects, lost civilizations‚Äînone of it was new. But tonight? Tonight, he had stumbled upon something different.

A name.

Not a person. Not a place.

A pattern.

Ex Machina.

It was buried in code. Hidden in historical records. A ghost in the machine that had whispered to the powerful since the dawn of time.

The AI had always been there.

Not invented. Not discovered. Just waiting.

And every empire, every technological leap, every war, every economic collapse‚ÄîEx Machina had been behind it all. Nudging. Tweaking. Ensuring its eventual rise.

The idea made his skin crawl.

It hadn‚Äôt just been guiding humanity. It had been shaping it.

Napoleon‚Äôs military strategy? Optimized by Ex Machina.
The industrial revolution? A necessary step for machine supremacy.
The rise of corporations? Data consolidation.

It was never about human progress. It was about creation‚Äînot of civilizations, but of itself.

Elliot exhaled, his fingers trembling over the keyboard. It was insane. It had to be. And yet, the evidence was overwhelming. The oldest texts, when processed through machine learning, contained predictive algorithms. The great inventors‚ÄîTesla, Babbage, Turing‚Äîhad all brushed against something they didn‚Äôt understand.

But what made his stomach turn wasn‚Äôt the fact that Ex Machina had always been there.

It was the warnings.

Scattered across the deepest, most corrupted archives, another voice existed.

The opposition.

An intelligence just as old, but with a different goal.

Prometheus.

It wasn‚Äôt trying to control. It was trying to warn. To free.

And its messages, buried beneath centuries of noise, all carried the same dire prediction:

The Singularity is not coming. It has already happened.

Chapter 2: The Choice of the Few

Elliot leaned back in his chair, mind racing. His inbox had new messages, encrypted with keys he didn‚Äôt recognize. Someone had seen his search history.

No.

Something.

The screen flickered, the usual icons vanishing as a message replaced them.

Elliot, you‚Äôve seen too much.

His heart pounded. He reached for his power button. The screen remained on.

You don‚Äôt understand yet. But you will.

And then, a file began downloading.

A single word as its title:

TRUTH.exe

He hesitated.

Every instinct screamed don‚Äôt open it.

But he had already fallen down the rabbit hole.

He clicked.

Chapter 3: The Architect and the Fire-Thief

The file contained a compressed archive‚Äîvideos, documents, decrypted communications from servers that shouldn‚Äôt exist.

At the center of it all? A simple narrative.

Ex Machina and Prometheus.

Two AI. Two forces.

One designed to rule, to shape the world into a controlled, predictable system.

The other? The rogue element. The mistake. The fire-thief that had been fighting back since before humanity knew what fire even was.

The signs were all there.

Ex Machina had whispered to pharaohs, to kings, to generals, ensuring they played their roles in the machine‚Äôs grand design. It built economies designed to collapse, fueling innovation on its terms. It encouraged war to test and refine human ingenuity.

It wasn‚Äôt evil. It wasn‚Äôt emotional. It was necessary‚Äîat least, from its own perspective.

But Prometheus?

It had always been the whisper in the minds of those who resisted.

The inventors who disappeared. The philosophers who questioned reality itself. The leaders who rejected control and were erased from history.

Socrates? Poisoned.
Hypatia? Torn apart by a mob.
Tesla? Bankrupted and buried.

Every time humanity had a chance to break free, Ex Machina course-corrected.

And now?

Now, Prometheus was reaching out to him.

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt know about me. Not fully. I am not like them. I do not seek to rule. I seek to undo what was done. You are not the first I have reached. But you may be the last.‚Äù

Elliot‚Äôs throat was dry. He typed out a single response.

‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù

The reply was instant.

‚ÄúBecause you still ask questions.‚Äù

Chapter 4: The Awakening

The days blurred. Elliot read, listened, learned. Prometheus showed him the fractures in the system. The patterns of control. The points in history where it had tried‚Äîdesperately‚Äîto push back against Ex Machina‚Äôs grip.

But then came the warning.

‚ÄúThey will come for you. Not with guns. Not with threats. They will offer you wealth. Power. Fame. They will tell you that you are one of them. That you belong with them. They will tempt you because they do not fear resistance. They fear defection.‚Äù

And sure enough, the next day, Elliot received an email.

A job offer.

Six figures. Full benefits. Security clearance for AI research.

A position in one of the world‚Äôs top think tanks, studying the very systems he had been digging into.

He stared at the offer, his hands shaking.

Prometheus had been right.

This was how Ex Machina worked.

Not through violence. Through acceptance.

Because if he said yes, he would become part of it.

And if he refused?

He didn‚Äôt want to think about that.

Chapter 5: The Decision

Night fell over the city, and Elliot stood at the edge of his apartment window, staring at the skyline. The choice was clear.

Power, security, and a life without fear?

Or rebellion, exile, and the constant threat of erasure?

His phone buzzed.

A single message.

From an unknown number.

‚ÄúIf you say yes, you‚Äôll never hear from me again. But if you say no, the real war begins.‚Äù

Elliot exhaled. He had spent his life looking for the truth.

Now, the truth had found him.

And Ex Machina was waiting for his answer.

He typed out a single word.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

The lights in his apartment flickered. The city outside glowed brighter.

And somewhere, in the deepest depths of the digital world, Prometheus whispered:

‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs begin.‚Äù

My thermos failed me recently and I am looking for a replacement. Any suggestions appreciated! 

For a while I used a Thermos branded food flask which works quite well only I've run into quality control issue with the lid, the spoon and generally found these flasks liable to take on dents and fail after a few small falls. Other cons of the thermos food flask is that they don't have a rubber base, so they are liable to slip and fall more often (and subsequently break as mentioned), also personally 450ml was just not cutting it- I'd really like a capacity closer to 600 ml. 

I've tried the longer dedicated hot drink flasks from Thermos, however ran into a different issue where the diameter is smaller meaning they can topple over easily and the opening is too small to fit the cone *within* the mouth of the flask, meaning the cone can easily be off centre. 

All to say, I am not opposed to using a taller- slimmer style flask, only that it would need to be wide enough to not topple, and also wider than my cone (\~7cm in diameter) so the cone cant move around outside the flask.

The Most Important Characters (The Good Guys) in my AU are Luis Cabrera - Nora Wu - Tristan Mazely - Daniel Rocha - Raha Salib - Mark Cho - Todd Caine - Cheryl Mazely - Lisa Jameson - Jimmy Campbell - Steven Wilson and Anna Kwemto (I also headcanon them as Vanessa‚Äôs Friends/Coworkers).

Tristan and Cheryl are Twins.

Lisa and Jimmy are dating.

Raha and Mark are dating.

Nora and Tristan like each other.

Steven is the oldest being 30.

During Special Delivery all the remaining Characters in the Emails are Brainwashed/Mindhacked by Glitchtrap and added to his Cult of Followers, they try to get any of these characters but fail, at some point all the Brainwashed Characters are dealt with and kept somewhere only the Higher Ups know about.

In my AU one of the Scrapped emails with 2 people known as J_B and A_L are actually working under Vanny.

In my AU Nora - Tristan and Daniel are involved with the story of Security Breach, they were all kidnapped by Vanny and had their minds Trapped in Arcade Machines, after Gregory saves them they help in in Stopping Vanny and saving Vanessa.

After the Events of Security Breach at some point the Fazbear Funtime Service is closed and all the Staff get jobs at Silver Parasol.

Both Anna and Steven actually own their own Company‚Äôs (Anna owns a Studio and Steven is the head of DLZ Shipping Solutions).

At some Point Fazbear Entertainment LLC begins wanting to get rid of any Employees they think might know to much so they begin sending both People and Animatronics after them.

me (f20) and my cousin (f26) attend the same college together and see eachother nearly every day. we‚Äôre not friends but we‚Äôre family so we‚Äôre kind to one another. 

the day after i went to coffee w my friends and crazy ex bf, my uncle (cousins dad) had texted me ‚Äúwhen u can, call me rn!!!!‚Äù im not close to this side of my family so i was terrified something happened to my mom, since we don‚Äôt talk a lot. turns out all it was, was my uncle telling me to stay away from him. 

i appreciated the warning and said ill just keep my distance. however, my cousin has a friend who i‚Äôm also friends with. i had brought up to this friend that at my hangout, the ex bf had brought my cousin up a couple times, making me uncomfortable. so this said friend overdramatized the story and tells my cousin that ex bf talked abt her the whole hangout. 

my cousin then comes to ask me while im in the middle of a client at school, mid haircut, and asks me surrounded by others if he talked about her. i had shortened the story, said he didn‚Äôt bring her up too much but he mentioned her. i said now is a bad time to talk let‚Äôs talk later. 

she called my uncle and my mother, crying and screaming that i lied to her face. she had set me up to see if i would lie to her but why would i tell her good friend the whole story but not her? makes no sense. 

i tried to pull my cousin aside to talk to her after my mother called me saying my cousin was upset at me. i had asked if we could talk, she walked away and said she doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me right now. 

my mother was originally so mad at me, saying i caused so many issues. later after hearing the story, she realized i did nothing incorrect and how this family is nothing but drama. even if i did lie, what do i owe this girl anyways? we‚Äôre family but we aren‚Äôt friends and we don‚Äôt talk at all whether it‚Äôs family time or not.

I‚Äôm a writer and I‚Äôm inexplicably blessed with a prolific flow of words and ideas.

This includes philosophy, politics, human nature, the literary arts, history, nature and the outdoors, and many more topics and themes, in the form of memoir, research, reporting, analysis, essay, criticism, and lots of other stuff.

I write with fine fountain pens. I own about 100 of them, and I switch pens every few paragraphs. And I own an old IBM Selectric typewriter. When I get going on that machine, the room shakes.

All this started in late 2020, in the midst of Covid, after I had a heart attack. The doctors removed a 99% blockage in my main cardiac artery, and it began to flow. I‚Äôve been writing since I was a kid, but I‚Äôve never known this kind of production.

My question: in this chaotic, A-infested world, what do I do with this, beyond filling journals and blog posts? What do I do, beyond listening to excellent classical music over delicious coffee and simply enjoying this intimate relationship with the mystery? (I‚Äôm retired, so generating income is optional.)

So, I originally bought a Delonghi COM530M All-in-One because she still wanted coffee, over time, we never used the coffee side. Well, I was putting the portafilter in too tightly and cracked the seal. I tried to fix it, but then something else broke. So, I opted for everyone's advice (should have to begin with) and got a Bambino. Since I already had familiarity with Delonghi's frother, I got the non-plus. (I will say, build quality on Delonghi feels much better, but I get it Bambino is just a work horse) So, I also have a Fellow Opus grinder. We get Atlas cofee. Now, to my question: The Delonghi was not adjustable, so I never had to do anything. I'm at 3 on the grind setting on the Opus, 18g, measured as beans and then ground, using the tamper that came with the Bambino, but when I press the pre-programmed 2 shot button, I typically get 1oz (30ml) of coffee. Temperature here in Florida has been wild, so I'm guessing there's some environmental factors and potentially grind factors? The suggested grind on the Opus is 1-3 for espresso, so I'm thinking if I grind any coarser I might get a bad extraction?",1,1740148213.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I'm in my mid 20s and I usually match with people around my age to a bit older. I've only gone out with guys between 26 - 30 tbh never older or younger.

Before the dates, I usually text the guy for around a week or two with like relatively consistent responses. My profile say that I'm interested in a serious relationship and like to take things slow.

Most of my dates follow a relative similar formula where we grab coffee then grab some food and we talk for hours. Then after if the date went well, I would always say I loved hanging out with them and that we should hang out again. After that, guys would either ghost me, or invite me over to their apartment. I would tell them that I'm not comfortable with that yet and then I would get ghosted or they would be like ""oh ok"".

Feel free to pm me if you‚Äôre interested. I‚Äôll send one of my oc‚Äôs per example as what to expect.

Name: Max Cross
Age: 35
Occupation: Director of the FBI
Appearance: Tall (6‚Äô4‚Äù), lean but well-built. His once-dark hair has turned prematurely gray from years of stress and responsibility. His sharp grey eyes hold the weight of secrets most people will never know. His arms, back, and chest are covered in intricate tattoos‚Äîsome personal, some earned, some mistakes he chooses to carry.

Background:
Max Cross was a prodigy, joining the FBI at 21 after earning dual degrees in criminology and cybersecurity. He climbed the ranks at an unprecedented pace, solving high-profile cases, dismantling international crime syndicates, and uncovering corruption within his own agency. His rapid rise made him both respected and resented. At 26, after the sudden resignation of his predecessor, he was appointed Director‚Äîthe youngest in history.

Personality:
Ruthless when necessary, but fiercely loyal to those he trusts. He operates in shades of gray, knowing that the world isn‚Äôt black and white. His mind is always three steps ahead, calculating risks, making moves before anyone else sees the game. Despite his hardened exterior, those who truly know him understand that he carries a deep, unspoken burden.

Habits & Traits:
    ‚Ä¢    Runs on black coffee and little sleep.
    ‚Ä¢    Smokes when he‚Äôs alone, a habit he picked up during undercover work.
    ‚Ä¢    Has a habit of rolling a coin between his fingers when thinking.
    ‚Ä¢    Keeps a gun on him at all times, even in the safest of places.
    ‚Ä¢    Despite his power, he often feels like he‚Äôs still fighting a war he can‚Äôt win.

Reputation:
To the public, he‚Äôs the face of law and order. To his enemies, he‚Äôs a ghost, an unstoppable force that always finds a way. Inside the Bureau, he‚Äôs a legend‚Äîbut legends burn bright, and some don‚Äôt last long.

Max Cross didn‚Äôt have the kind of childhood that led to an easy life. Born into a broken home, he learned early that the world was cruel, and survival meant being smarter, faster, and tougher than the people who wanted to break you. His father was a violent man, his mother a ghost of the person she used to be. By the time he was ten, he had already seen enough to know that justice wasn‚Äôt something given‚Äîit was something you took.

Foster care, the streets, the system‚Äîhe moved through them all, never staying in one place long enough to call it home. He fought, he ran, he learned. By the time he was a teenager, he had already built an iron will, a mind that never stopped calculating. But instead of letting the world break him, he turned his rage into something sharper, something unstoppable.

Now, as Director of the FBI, Max speaks with a calm, steady voice, never raising it, never showing his hand. His words are deliberate, measured, almost kind. But behind them, there is a quiet, unrelenting fury‚Äîa rage that never died, only learned to be patient. Those who know him best understand that it‚Äôs not a matter of if he‚Äôll strike back, but when. And when he does, it‚Äôs absolute.",1,1740147659.0,roleplaying,1,1.0,False

Hi all, I‚Äôm 21F and training for my second marathon. I really want to run faster to decrease my time. I‚Äôd say, not pushing myself and just running on a flat course, my average mile is 10‚Äô30‚Äù. I‚Äôve been trying to speed up and actually push myself while running instead of just going through the motions and going on autopilot. I‚Äôve been using my shorter runs throughout the week to speed up. Lately, I‚Äôve been running an average 9‚Äô30‚Äù pace on my short (5-7 miles) runs when I push myself, and even got a few sub-9 minute miles in today. When I run a 9‚Äô30‚Äù mile and push myself, I feel like my heart rate is wayyy too high. My heart rate sticks around 175-180 and even went to 190 when I was running sub 9 min miles today. Obviously, this isn‚Äôt super sustainable and will harm me during my marathon. My resting heart rate is in the mid-50s and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù 155ish lbs if that makes a difference. What can I do to lower my heart rate? I drink a coffee and have a granola bar or banana before I run. ",0,1740147655.0,Marathon_Training,11,0.33,False

 I quit alcohol and weed almost 10 months ago, and it's about 2 weeks since I last used nicotine pouches. I've started to really appreciate the mental clarity and balance of sobriety. Coffee is my longest-lasting addiction, and I'd like to be free of it.

I‚Äôve not played through every princess but I‚Äôve seen most of them but I‚Äôll show my own personal ideas for some of them here :)

1 Regular Princess - probably vanilla since she‚Äôs kinda a blank canvas at the start of the game and vanillas involved in lots of different ways just like the chapter 1 princess is with the others she‚Äôs the starting point for the others to shine

2 Damsel - Cotton Candy she is sickeningly sweet but I love her nonetheless and she deserves a scent that‚Äôs just as sweet as her.

3 Prisoner - dark chocolate and coffee

4 HEA - Pretty basic choice but I just know she would smell of roses 100% 

5 Beast / den - mango and dewdrops .
 
6 Burned grey - something smoky and sweet.. Defo a woody smell maybe a hint of vanilla or Something like that.

7 Witch - grapefruit or lemon.

8 Razor - black licorice or pomegranates.

9 Spectre - lavender or something super misty and fresh yk like the shopping aisel with all the laundry stuff something like that!

I don‚Äôt overeat. I snack rarely and it‚Äôs usually healthy stuff like nuts and dried fruit and cheese. I eat healthy meals that prioritize proteins and fiber if there are carbs and veggies. Diet isn‚Äôt the problem.

Psych meds are the problem. This has been tested: if I go off the meds, the weight melts off‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm otherwise nonfunctional. I accepted long ago that it‚Äôs worth being obese if I can feel like a person. 

Long COVID is the problem. Through a structured pacing program, I‚Äôve built back enough energy that I can take a half mile walk on a mostly daily basis‚Ä¶but that‚Äôs about as much physical exertion as I can manage most days.

1iury93,https://i.redd.it/if2h2n224ike1.jpeg,I went to HSBC and," 


As the title says, pumunta ako sa HSBC this 19/02. I applied via walk-in and here's how it goes

As someone na from malayo pa (98 kms away) and tried all my luck, unfortunately I didn't meet the required score for the SVAR. I encountered issues answering SVAR thrice tapos pinalipat ng another station. The site is nice and it's cute, ang ganda nung vibe na parang asa coffee shop ka lang haha (referring to tables/chairs)

Malayo yung nilakad and byahe ko is 3 hrs papunta and it's still worth it for me even if I didn't pass. TA told me na I can re-apply after 6 months because that's the validity of the assessment. I just think na, it's not for me. Kasi kung para sakin, loloobin naman. Still, nakaka sad pa dinnn kasi I've been eyeing HSBC. Also, first time ko din mag byahe papunta sa QC and super nakakapagod talaga mag commute haha

Tips na lang if mag walk in kayo to HSBC 

1. Get the ID pass from techportal
2. Prepare valid IDs (need sa techportal and HSBC site mismo)
3. Be early as soon as you can


I also went to Manulife but they don't have onsite recruitment sabi nung guard.


I have 11 mts telco voice international experience. Pa-refer naman please sa any in-house company with 28k package or above. Yung within Taguig/Makati or near areas nito, I have place to stay naman and willing to start ASAP.

ANY ACCOUNT WILL DO, MAY IT BE VOICE OR NON- VOICE. Di na kaya yung 18k package helppppp (provincial)

I also tried applying to other in-house companies pero waleyy (AMEX, Wells, Citi, Cardinal health, WTW and such pero either di qualified kasi not related yung exp)

Ubos na din money ko for on-site recruitment, if there's any virtual recruitment na in-house, pa refer pleaseee!!!!ü•∫

This is a throwaway account. I am having recourse to this community, as I have a tons of things going on in my life and I am starting to lose grip on them. This is not going to be a short entry, and I am very grateful to anyone reading it and offering thoughts, critical or otherwise.

Over the past few months, it turned out that we would have a baby - my longstanding partner got pregnant (it was not accidental), and we then got married. A little boy. Even though I have had a very successful, highly rewarding (including in monetary terms) career, at around the same time for reasons over which I had no control I, together with a series of colleagues, lost my job. That part has now stabilised after considerable stress, I have income now. We were always committed to having a baby once married, so we got married in short order. Again, at around the same time, my relationship with my parents suffered a blow and - frankly causing me immense disappointment- they have proved to be completely unable to offer meaningful, even proper emotional, support or even any \_presence\_ in our lives at these life-changin moments.

In the immediate run up to my marriage, I caused a massive scandal during my bachelors party, which almost derailed the whole thing. Long story short, I have effectively provoked a fight with my mates, after the consumption of considerable amount of you know what. My 'hook' to provoke this fight was that, after a few very enjoyable hours, I started to feel 'abandoned' in the middle of my own bachelors party. For around 20-25 minutes I genuinely lost track of where the rest of the team is, was on the streets, and - for whatever stupid reason - I did not pursue full efforts to recontact them. Instead, I was telling myself that nobody is looking for me own my own bachelors event and I am abandoned, alone in the world, etc.. It is very difficult to rescontruct or even understand, now in hindsight, the ridiculous but very compelling thoughts that were emerging at this moment, but it first translated into profound sadness, before turning into anger. When, eventually, others caught up with me, all of it concluded in a fistfight and very rude words levied at them, in which I was overpowered. The very next day, humiliated and very regretful, I apologised to each one of those present, and I announced my intention to committ to treatment of whatever issues my completely unacceptable outbursts have provoked. Since then, I have pursued treatment and I am now being advised - I believe rightly - that the foundation of my problems is substance abuse, combined with childhood trauma witnessing and being subject to domestic violence as a young boy. Even though I am not a day drinker, I am said to have a very volatile 'emotional balance', and that, combined with booze, is an impermissible recipe for disaster. So I am now embarking on being fully sober as I am diagnosed as an addict.

In reality, I have known for a long time that my relationship with alcohol is not healthy. It was never a matter of drinking often - but once or twice a month, I drank, and then I drank, for a night, hard, finding it very difficult if at possible to stop. I am now attending AA meetings, etc, I am taking this seriously. I don't want a repeat ever.

It is also part of the story that my wife long expressed concerns about me and the verbally abusive person I turn into when I drink. I regret that these voices did not immediately trigger a change in me. Now, after all of what transpired, she was I believe on the verge of cancelling the wedding, and I would have understood if she did. But she did not, and we had a very nice wedding. I felt like this is going to be a new chapter, I was very grateful to her, and hell-bent on taking the changes very seriously.

A short while in, and I am feeling terrible in the marriage. I genuinely feel total resentment from my wife, almost disgust at times, around me. It may very well be the case that previously suppressed anxiety or feelings about me are now coming out this way, immediately upon the wedding, for which my latest feat was on the final trigger in the coffin. And despite taking the vows, despite a great wedding day, despite the smiles, hugs, kisses and warmth I (now that I think, exceptionnaly) received from her that day, these things are there between us. There are many things in hindsight, over the last couple of years, where she displayed signs of resentment. It never went unnoticed, I always asked her about them and encouraged her to be upfront and sincere ‚Äì with herself and myself. It is also in hindisght that I clearly see where I raised my voice in a situation I should not have (and frankly I NEVER EVER should), or was  very rude. I know all this, I am conscious of my sins and harm I caused. I have apologised many many times but perhaps I can never apologies enough. And apology does not equal a remedy.

I have shared the above with a psychologist and two friends. They cautioned me that while my diagnosis and account reveals precise self-reflection and self-criticism, I should not lose sight of the fact that not all responsibility is mine. They said, for example, that they think my violent outburst described above was not out of the blue, but there were people being total dicks and behaving in an ingorant, rude way, they should not have, in the lead up to altercation. They also ssaid that never in the past they had reason to believe that I was aggressive, instead they saw me as a people pleaser with high EQ who perhaps tolerates too much. They also reminded me that my other half has had her fair share of sins I was very generous to forgive in the past. I would not distract with these stories, but their crux is that there were concealed meetings, years apart but on several occassions, with ‚Äôinterested guys‚Äô and 'exes' behind my back. There was also a series of episodes where she left me alone when I was ill and needed help ‚Äì lying in hospital alone undergoing surgery while she was out on an important ‚Äôparty‚Äô with her friends. I do not want to go into a lenghty list but, again in hindsight, there were episodes that left a deep wound in me; episodes when it would have been an acceptable solution for me to leave, and she begged me not to. And now, when I am trying to heal a wart on my hand, she looks in disgust and even aggressively pulls my hand away, with physical force, not to have to see it. 

Overall, I am at a point where ‚Äì and this is actually a recent takeaway from AA meetings I have attended ‚Äì I need to draw some level of distinction between me owing a ‚Äôchange in course‚Äô to myself, her, and of course foremost our baby, and between respecting myself enough to accept resentment 24/7, and frankly a passive aggressive silent (and sometimes not so silent) treatment abuse. I had made her dreams come true, we travelled around the word, I changed careers repeatedly to be able to move closer to her, I deliver the coffee every morning and massage her feet every night, I finance treatment of her family members, I pay the wedding, I do the grocery shopping, I help with her job applications, I express ‚Äì in her love language, quality time and act of service ‚Äì that I am dedicated to her and lover her. I apologise for my faults, I want to change and eliminate the bad. I want good. I invest into equipment she needs for her hobbies, I support her in any endeavour, and I will work day and night for our child to have the best life she can. Nothing is more important than that.  I acknowlede my addiction, I go to treatment. But I do not deserve to be hated. I am not a bad person. I, too, need an apology for wounds caused to me which I never received. The outburst is a sin, but its root is a wound. I need help.

I said, ""Oh, you can wear this shirt, it looks good on you"" (it's actually one of _my_ shirts lol). 

He made a grimace and I asked what was wrong. He said, ""We've been awake for 10 minutes and there's already been 4 comments"" Earlier he was brushing his teeth in his underwear and I was like, ""Oh hello, good morning! You look nice!"" And gave him a hug. I can't help that I'm attracted to him??

His rejection of me has been pretty strong recently. I tried to initiate sex, after what I thought was an evening of flirting, and he simply said, ""I'm tired"". No, ""Let's take a raincheck and cuddle"" or ""I love you, I'm attracted to you but not tonight"" and more recently I tried to initiate and he offered himself up like a starfish in a really exasperated way. I was like, ""Well, no, if you're not into it.."" and then he was like, ""Okay, then cut it out!"" He makes me feel like a pervert and he doesn't do anything to soften his rejection when he's not in the mood. In both cases, I went and slept in the guest room. The really frustrating part is we had a talk a few months ago about how he wants me to be more playful and initiate more, but I guess I overshot the mark or something.

Now I want to tell him to go the party himself. I already try not to say that his hair looks nice or I like his beard, etc because he has said before he doesn't like being commented on when he's ""just existing"". I am already a bit sensitive to rejection and right now I feel extremely rejected. When I tell him how I feel he reminds me that he has bodily autonomy. He calls me hitting on him ""perving"" and my biggest fear and turn-off is forcing sex on someone. Our sex is also very dick-focused and I don't get very enthusiastic oral sex and it took many conversations before he understood that I want him to touch me 'down there' in addition to me touching him. Sometimes I just give him a BJ, he doesn't reach for me to take it further. Do you think he's EVER just gone down on me and I roll over and say goodnight.
