1gqm7zl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlieTheTraveler/comments/1gqm7zl/vietnam_where_should_i_visit_what_itinerary/,Vietnam: Where Should I Visit & What Itinerary Should I Follow?,"Below is an article I wrote in which I explained where in Vietnam I think you should visit, how much time I think you should spend at each of these recommended destinations and the order in which to visit these destinations. Feel free to direct message me if you need help.

**Day 1:** The Country’s Most Tropical Destination

To get to your first destination, fly to the city of Ho Chi Minh and then take another flight to the island of Phu Quoc. Check out the night market.

**Day 2:** A Day Perfect for Parents Traveling with Kids

As an excursion, we first head to an animal park. After seeing animals such as birds and goats as well as watching a bird show, we are taken into an area of the park that is home to large animals, such as tigers, rhinos and lions. Next, we head to a theme park called VinWonders Phu Quoc. Our day ends at Grand World. This is an Italian-looking entertainment and shopping complex.

**Day 3:** White-Sand Beaches, Clear Waters & Cable Cars

Before returning to and staying in Ho Chi Minh, we go snorkeling. The highlights of the boat cruise are the islands of Mong Tay, Gam Ghi and May Rut. All three are great for swimming. Gam Ghi is where we go snorkeling. We should be at a water park called Hon Thom Island (a.k.a. Pineapple Island) around 3:00pm. We have around 1.5 hours there to play. From the water park, we take the cable car to an architecturally stunning complex known as Sun World. We arrive in Ho Chi Minh in the nighttime.

**Day 4:** Biking, Delta Cruising & Partying

We go on a daytrip today. Firstly, we are taken to Vinh Trang Pagoda. Next, we are taken to the Mekong River Delta. There we go on a boat cruise. Lunch is included on today’s tour and is served at a working farm (a.k.a. farm stay) typically around 12:30pm. At this same working farm, we go on a bike tour. We should be back at our hotel around 5:30pm. We have the rest of the evening to ourselves.

Consider going for a walk, starting with an energy and music-filled street called Nguyen Hue, then to a market called Ben Thanh and then to a street dotted with restaurants called Thai Van Lung. You could then take a quick taxi ride to a nightlife-filled street called Bui Vien. Also worth checking out are the sky bars in the downtown area.

**Day 5:** The Secrets & Tricks of Warfare Followed by a Decorative Bridge & a Night Market

Before relocating by flight to the city of Da Nang, we are provided with a guided Ho Chi Minh city tour. We are then taken to the Cu Chi Tunnels. Here you see exactly how the Vietnam War was fought, with death traps, hidden places and more. We should be arriving in Da Nang in the nighttime. En route to our hotel, we see the so-called Dragon Bridge, which features a rather unique architectural design. After checking into your hotel, we recommend you visit the night market as well as a nearby lounge and club complex called ‘Yachy’. Dress nicely.

**Day 6:** Walking on Marble Mountains & the Country’s Prettiest Town

We make an excursion from Da Nang. Firstly, we are taken to a cluster of five marble and limestone hills. Collectively they are called the Marble Mountains, a.k.a. Ngu Hanh Son. In the early-evening, we are taken to the town of Hoi An. There we are provided with a guided tour. Highlights include a local outdoor market called Nguyen Hoang, traditional homes, pagodas, an assembly hall called Phuc Kien, the Japanese bridge, Hoai River, Lantern Street and the silk shops.

**Day 7:** A Resort Built by French Architects & a Bridge Designed Like No Other

Before relocating by flight from Da Nang to the capital that is Hanoi, we visit a hill station and resort called Ba Na Hill Station (a.k.a. Ba Na Hills). It was founded in 1919 by French colonists. It was built as a leisure destination for French tourists. Being located 1500 meters above sea level, it has a view of the East Sea and the surrounding mountains. We reach this hill station and resort by cable car. In operation since March 29, 2013, it holds the world record for the longest nonstop single track cable car, at 5,801 meters (19,032 feet) in length. Highlights of our tour include the internationally acclaimed Golden Bridge, the garden, and the wine cellar. Another detail worth mentioning is that a buffet-style lunch is included on today’s tour and is served in the charming ‘French Village’, which is reached by cable car.

**Day 8:** Sightseeing in the Capital

Before relocating by land to the town of Ha Giang, we explore Hanoi. Highlights include the Opera House, Ho Tay Lake, Chua Tran Quoc Temple, Temple of Literature, Saint Joseph’s Cathedral and Hoan Kiem Lake (a.k.a. Restored Sword Lake). Hanoi is home to little streets and alleyways with food stalls, as well as restaurants squeezed up next to each other. The city vibe is one that visitors can easily feel and appreciate.

**Day 9:** Scenic Valleys, Winding Roads & Selfies

There is much to see as we relocate today by land from Ha Giang to the village of Dong Van. Firstly, we are taken to Thach Son Than Buckwheat Flowers Fields. It is a perfect spot for taking selfies. Next, we are taken to Quan Ba Heaven Gate. There we can purchase a coffee while overlooking the fine valley. Next, we are taken to Fairy Bosom (a.k.a. Núi đôi Quản Bạ). There we walk to a beautiful lookout point.

Next, we are taken to the settlement of Lung Tam. Upon arrival in Lung Tam, we see how locals do centuries-old weaving and embroidery techniques. Next, we are taken to an observation deck called Đài Quan Sát Yên Minh. Next, we are taken to a viewpoint called Dốc Thẩm Mã. Meeting a local tribe while taking photos of the winding road between the mountains makes for a great 10-minute stop. Before reaching Dong Van, finally we are taken to the Lung Cam Cultural Tourist Village, which is located in the Sung La Valley. There we meet another local tribe.

**Day 10:** An Authentic Outdoor Market, Tribal People & the North’s Picturesque Landscape

Before leaving Dong Van, we walk to a lookout point and then visit two local markets. After leaving this village, our first destination is a scenic pass called Ma Pí Leng. Next, we are taken to a village called Meo Vac. There we meet a local tribe wearing traditional black attire, see traditional homes and pass by Nho Que River. Lastly, we are taken to our hotel, located in the area of Ba Be National Park.

**Day 11:** A Lake Cruise, Caves & Canoeing

Before relocating back to Hanoi, there is much to see and do in and around Ba Be National Park. Highlights include a boat cruise around the lake, Puong Cave, Dau Dang Waterfall, kayaking at Widow's Island and meeting tribal Thai people and seeing rice fields in a village called Cam Ha. Before returning to Hanoi, we explore Hua Ma Cave.

**Day 12:** Floating in the Water & One of Southeast Asia’s Greatest Sunset Locations

We go on a daytrip today to Ha Long Bay. This is Vietnam’s most popular day trip destination…and for good reason. Ha Long Bay is arguably the country’s most naturally gifted area, along with the rice fields of the North. Highlights today include Surprising Cave, swimming and kayaking or bamboo rafting at Titov Island, and watching the sunset (if visiting between April and September).

**Day 13:** Rice Fields, Peddling, Paddling & the Ancient City

We go on another daytrip today. Firstly, we are taken to the ancient capital of Vietnam. It is called Hoa Lu. At this village, we check out the temple. Nearby and next, we go on a guided bike ride. After exploring the countryside, we can eat. After our meal, we are taken to a river called Tam Coc. There we go on a paddle boat ride, led by a local. The highlights are the mountains, the surrounding rice fields and the caves. Upon returning to the dock, we are taken to Mua Cave. The cave itself pales in comparison to the views we get after ascending Lying Dragon Mountain. After hiking to the top, we return to Hanoi.

This evening, we recommend you watch the train pass by a popular coffee shop located at 29A P. Nguyễn Thái Học, Cửa Nam, Ba Đình. After seeing it squeeze between residential buildings, consider walking to Ta Hien Street. This is Hanoi’s most popular street for nightlife.

**Day 14:** Mausoleums, Palaces & More

Below is the list of attractions we will try to see today.

1. Ho Chi Minh's Mausoleum
2. Presidential Palace
3. Ho Chi Minh’s Stilt House: This is the former residence of Communist Ho Chi Minh.
4. One Pillar Pagoda
5. Imperial Citadel of Thang Long
6. Vietnam Military History Museum
7. B52 Victory Museum
8. Lotte Observation Deck

Day 15: Our Tour Ends This Morning

Head to the Hanoi airport and fly out.

1gqm6tr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gqm6tr/navigating_rekindled_romance_after_breakup/,Navigating Rekindled Romance after breakup,"Me (30F) kind of rekindled relationship with ex (31M) a couple of months ago. We ended things last summer 2023 after nearly a year. He's German and sometimes his verbal communication can be harsh and also his delivery isn't exactly the best. But he has some other great qualities, plans everything to the T so I don't have to worry about it, pays for everything, let's me know about his whereabouts and he's very handsome man although balding a bit. I honestly didn't know how to handle him at that time since he had some deaths in his family and he shut me down. I went three times to meet him and gave him the support I could, but he was still processing those feelings and even the smallest thing I did bothered him and he got verbally combative, I got very upset and instead of communicating I started packing my things up(big mistake) and he broke things off. I cried a lot and he was very upset too for shutting me down, he sent my stuff through post too. We didn't talk for nearly a year. 

I go to Vienna( where he lives) often for work and for interviews and started seeing my stories and started asking me why I'm there, I kept things casual and one day he insisted to meet me even for a few minutes if I could manage only even a coffee. I agreed but I moved to Germany at that time already but we kept in touch, he sent me pictures of his family that things had cooled down abit. 

I had to go to Budapest meanwhile where I lived before for some paperwork and said I'll pass by vienna, he offered his place for me to freshen up from travel and everything, when we met after our breakup it was sweet, he kissed my forehead multiple times and gave me the keys to his apartment and told me in German that he's happy that I'm there. When I finished my sightseeing, he came home cooked for me and I ended up staying over. 

We still kept in touch, he let's me know about his whereabouts always, send me pictures of his friends even when he's with his friends on their stag do, when he's with his dad, cooking w his mom all those things. I ended up visiting vienna again cz I had an interview there, I stayed at his apartment but the old wounds kind of opened up, he has a very bad delivery as told before and it ended up hurting me, with him saying that sometimes I expect him to do everything for me and that i struggle with basic tasks to the point where he said in the future when we have kids it would be a challenge with how i operate things, when in reality I was adjusting to his space, after listening to him complain I physically shut down after that and didn't let him touch me, I also told him that he lacks empathy and he would be a good boss but I would not have him as my partner which hurt him I guess. He didn't apologize but I was crying at night and he thought I slept so he pulled me close, kissed me, wiped my tears and pulled the covers over for me. He really struggles with verbal communication and can only show through actions while I physically block when I get upset. 

The next day morning I was still very sad with all that happened, I made breakfast and he asked me if I would stay over and try to cheer me up with some king julian memes which I love but I didn't react, when all I wanted to was just to hold him. He came downstairs to drop me off and he told me that we don't have to go through the pain and end things and wished me for my work in Vienna. I said vienna is not for me and I wouldn't want to be here( I regret that too :( but everything was just too raw) and left. I had time process everything that happened. Although what he said hurt me, he has so many other good qualities. He's actually a great guy but just struggles with intimacy generally. He still hasnt deleted my number, has kept my things still unlike last time when he sent them back and actively views my social media. I do want to give this a chance but I feel like he's at wrong here and wanted him to apologize but I ended up clearing the interview too and I might have a next round in vienna soon. 

My question is should I reach out to clear out the air when I go to his city for the interview again? Is there a future here? 

I'm sorry for the super long post, just wanted to get it off my chest :) ",1,1731528500.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1gqm6tg,https://www.reddit.com/r/raypeat/comments/1gqm6tg/anyone_do_better_on_espresso_than_coffee/,Anyone do better on espresso than coffee? ,"This probably sounds nuts, but when I have a Starbucks peppermint mocha, I feel calm, clear-headed and focused for the rest of the day. No spike and crash, no jitters, etc. I figure it's the lower caffeine content in the espresso. When I brew k-cups at home, I get jittery, irritated, and I crash a few hours later. SBux coffee is crappy, and the stuff my husband brews at home is crappy, so it's probably not the mold or mycotoxin, but the caffeine content. Can I brew espresso at home to mimic the caffeine content of SBux? Is that a weird question? Anyone else out there do well on espresso but not regular coffee? 

PS- I did look up the syrups at SBux. Just sugar, no corn syrup. That's a plus, I guess, but it's still a crapload of sugar, so a peppermint mocha every day probably isn't a good idea. :) ",1,1731528499.0,raypeat,0,1.0,False

So here's my frustration: I frequently order a Vanilla Sweet Cream Nitro Cold Brew. It's my favorite drink at Starbucks. It's delicious when made correctly. Smooth with a touch of sweetness. 70 calories.

I'd say that 75% of the time, the coffee comes out great. The other 25% of the time, it comes out sickeningly sweet. Undrinkable to me. Sometimes the staff add vanilla syrup to the bottom of the cup before pouring the nitro and sometimes they add like 1.5 inches of sweet cream.

I'm not a very confrontational person and I *hate* to bring it up that it's too sweet. Sometimes I feel they're giving me the Karen look, or don't believe me when I say that I think there's vanilla syrup in it. All I want is to enjoy my coffee. I've tried explicitly asking for no syrup, but most of the time the cashier (correctly) tells me that my drink doesn't come with syrup. I've had somewhat better luck asking for ""light sweet cream"" and hoping they don't put syrup in it.

Do you have any tips for how I can order my coffee and ensure that it's made correctly? Can I ask for the sweet cream on the side so that I can adjust the level myself? Thanks in advance!",0,1731528346.0,starbucks,0,0.5,False

Ms. Akloo Meurss adjusted her vibrant crimson blouse, gazing into the mirror with determined eyes. At 28, she had achieved what many dreamt of—a coveted position at the Alpha Jerra Federation News HQ. The sprawling metropolis of Alpha Jerra, the heart of the Federation, buzzed with activity as races from all realms mingled under the towering skyline. Today marked her debut broadcast.  “Make them listen,” she whispered to herself.  The studio was a dazzling array of crystal-powered lights, scrying orbs, and enchanted projection panels. Her co-anchor, a silver-haired Drow named Tisvar Dalk, gave her an encouraging nod. “First story, first impression,” he said. “No pressure.”  



\### Chapter 1 (Continued): \*\*The Blooper Reel\*\*



  The countdown to Akloo’s debut ticked away as she adjusted her earpiece. The studio buzzed with last-minute preparations—lights adjusted, cameras repositioned, and producers barking orders. She felt the familiar jitters of live television but drew a deep breath to steady herself.  “Thirty seconds to air!” called the floor manager.  Tisvar Dalk, her co-anchor, smirked. “Don’t overthink it. Just talk to the realms like you’re talking to an old friend.”  The red light blinked on. “We’re live in 3… 2… 1.”  Akloo turned to the main camera, her radiant smile stealing the screen. “Good evening, V’asse Realms! I’m Akloo Meurss, and welcome to the Alpha Jerra Federation News, your trusted source for news across all dimensions. 



Our top story tonight—”  Then it happened.  A barely audible, unmistakable sound escaped.  Akloo froze for a fraction of a second, her mind scrambling to determine whether anyone else had noticed. The studio fell silent. Tisvar’s silver eyes widened, his lips twitching as he struggled to maintain composure.  “…the historic Trollkind treaty, marking a new era of cooperation,” she managed to continue, though her cheeks flushed crimson.  But it was too late. A ripple of stifled snickers erupted from the crew behind the cameras. Tisvar, ever the professional, jumped in to cover. “And let’s not forget, Akloo, the Trollkind have always had a knack for… breaking barriers.” His voice trembled on the word “breaking,” and Akloo’s shoulders shook as she suppressed a laugh.  When the broadcast ended, the control room erupted in laughter. 



The producer, wiping tears from his eyes, called out, “Akloo, congratulations on a memorable debut!”  



\---### The Blooper Reel  Later that night, Akloo sat in her modest apartment in Alpha Jerra, replaying the broadcast on her crystal orb. She winced as the blooper played out again, the faint but damning sound magnified in her mind.  A notification pinged. \*Tisvar has tagged you in a post.\*  Opening it, she groaned. It was a meme: a photo of her mid-broadcast with the caption, \*“Breaking news—literally!”\*  Her Vuetube notifications were already exploding. “Akloo Meurss: Federation’s first relatable news anchor!” one comment read. Another added, “Finally, someone who keeps it real on live TV!”  She buried her face in her hands but couldn’t help chuckling. “At least they think I’m relatable.”  



\---The next morning, Akloo walked into the studio, her head held high despite the barrage of good-natured ribbing. Tisvar greeted her with a fresh cup of enchanted coffee.  “Look on the bright side,” he said. “The realms love you already. You’re trending in 20 dimensions!”  Akloo smiled. “If I can survive this, I can survive anything.”  Her gaffe, though embarrassing, became an unexpected icebreaker, endearing her to viewers and colleagues alike. The incident even made it into the Federation News blooper reel, ensuring Akloo’s debut would go down in history—for better or worse.  



\---### Chapter 2: \*\*A Tale of Trollkind Unity\*\*



  Akloo’s first story took her to the rocky bastions of the Trollkind territories. A historic treaty was being signed between rival clans, a moment of unity unseen in centuries. She stood amidst towering figures with coarse skin and tusked grins, their voices booming in a guttural dialect.  “This treaty signifies peace,” one elder said solemnly, his tone rumbling like thunder. “Our people can now trade freely across realms.”  Akloo’s charisma shone as she interviewed leaders, breaking down their complex negotiations into digestible insights. The piece aired later that evening, and her genuine interest earned her a flood of praise.  



\### Chapter 2 (Continued): \*\*A Lunch Plan and a Live Moment\*\* 



 The buzz in the studio subsided as Akloo wrapped up her segment on the Trollkind unity treaty. Her charisma had carried her through the story, but her stomach growled quietly, reminding her she hadn’t eaten since breakfast.  As the cameras went off, she turned to her co-anchor, Tisvar Dalk, who was reviewing notes for the next segment. His silver hair shimmered under the studio lights, and his sharp, tailored suit gave him a regal air.  “Hey, Tisvar,” Akloo said, smoothing the hem of her navy blue dress. “What do you think about grabbing lunch at Obkren’s Grill after this?”  Tisvar raised an eyebrow, his lips curling into a sly smile. “The one in Downtown Alpha Jerra? The place where the bartenders juggle flaming cocktails?”  “That’s the one.” Akloo laughed. “Their Trollecj roast is legendary, and I need something hearty after covering that treaty. You in?”  



“Absolutely,” he replied. “It’s been ages since I’ve had a good roast. Just don’t challenge me to one of their Innagrenna spice shots—I hear they make even seasoned Drow cry.”  Akloo chuckled, imagining the dignified Tisvar shedding a tear over a fiery drink. She glanced at the monitor and noticed the floor manager signaling the final countdown to their live feed.  “Two minutes to air!”  Akloo took a moment to adjust her dress, tugging the fitted fabric to sit perfectly on her curves. She caught her reflection in the monitor—her wavy black hair framing her face, her makeup flawless. Tisvar gave her a quick once-over and grinned.  “Looking sharp, partner,” he said.  “You’re not so bad yourself,” she quipped, patting his shoulder as they moved into position. 



 \---### Back on the Air  As the camera light turned red, Akloo flashed her signature smile. “Welcome back to Alpha Jerra Federation News. In our next segment, we delve deeper into the Trollkind unity treaty, a historic moment for the Federation. Tisvar, your thoughts?”  Tisvar leaned in, his tone smooth and measured. 

“Akloo, this treaty is a landmark achievement. It signifies not only peace but also the potential for economic growth as the Trollkind open trade routes between their realms.”  Akloo nodded, transitioning seamlessly into a pre-recorded segment. As the footage rolled, she leaned closer to Tisvar and whispered, “Bet you ten gold coins I can handle more spice shots than you at Obkren’s.”  Tisvar smirked, keeping his gaze on the screen. “You’re on, but don’t say I didn’t warn you.” 



 \---### A Hiccup Before Lunch  After the broadcast wrapped, the two anchors laughed as they walked out of the studio toward their hover-lift. The city of Alpha Jerra awaited, its towering spires glinting under the midday sun. Obkren’s Grill and Bar was known for its eclectic menu and lively atmosphere, a favorite among the newsroom staff.  Unbeknownst to them, a minor incident at the bar would soon become the talk of the station, but for now, they relished the anticipation of good food and a friendly challenge.  “Let’s hope this place lives up to the hype,” Akloo said as they stepped into the lift.  Tisvar grinned. “And let’s hope you’re ready for the spice gauntlet.”  The day was shaping up to be just as colorful as the stories they reported. 



 \---### Chapter 3: \*\*Scandal in the Elven Council\*\* 



 Not every story was uplifting. The next assignment plunged Akloo into political intrigue in the Sylvanwood, where the Elven High Council faced allegations of corruption.  Reporting live from the ancient halls of the council chamber, Akloo navigated an environment of veiled threats and whispered conspiracies. “Many claim the council siphoned Federation aid for personal luxuries,” she said to the camera, her voice steady despite the palpable tension.  Her courage impressed even Tisvar, who quipped, “Not bad for a rookie. Elves don’t take kindly to outsiders uncovering their secrets.”



  \---### Chapter 4: \*\* The Refugee Crisis in the Ashen Wastes\*\* 



 The V'asse Federation prided itself on unity, but cracks appeared in its benevolent façade. Akloo traveled to the Ashen Wastes, where refugees from the Realm of Khaos sought safety.  Children with hollow eyes clutched their parents as Akloo narrated their plight. “These refugees fled their homes as a riftstorm tore through their realm. Now, they seek solace in a Federation that debates their worth.”  Akloo’s storytelling struck a chord, sparking debates across Alpha Jerra about the Federation’s responsibility to protect those in need.



  \---### Chapter 5: \*\*A Dragon’s Redemption\*\*



  Akloo’s next story involved a reformed dragon named Pyrragos, who had once terrorized villages but now advocated for peace. Meeting Pyrragos in his lair—a cavern filled with glimmering relics—was both thrilling and nerve-wracking.  “I’ve taken too much from this world,” Pyrragos rumbled, his molten eyes softening. “Now, I seek to give back.”  The interview became one of the highest-rated segments of the week, with Akloo earning accolades for her empathy in handling a subject of such legendary stature. 



 \---### Chapter 6: \*\*Underwater Whispers\*\*  



The Merfolk of the Azure Abyss extended a rare invitation to the Federation News to cover the grand Coral Convergence Festival. Wearing a breathing amulet, Akloo descended beneath the waves, marveling at the vibrant underwater kingdom.  “This festival celebrates the bond between Merfolk and the sea itself,” she explained, as iridescent fish swirled around her.  The Merfolk leaders used the platform to call attention to rising oceanic pollution caused by inter dimensional travel—a stark reminder of the Federation’s environmental responsibilities.



  \---### Chapter 7: \*\*Crisis on the Ice Planes\*\* 



 An emergency broadcast sent Akloo rushing to the icy world of Frystgard, where a sudden magical anomaly had trapped miners beneath the glaciers.  Standing in a blizzard, her breath visible in the freezing air, Akloo reported live as Federation rescue teams worked tirelessly. “The stakes are high, and time is running out,” she said, the urgency in her voice drawing viewers to their screens.  When the miners were finally pulled to safety, Akloo’s heartfelt coverage earned her the trust of both her audience and her colleagues.  



\---### Chapter 8: \*\*The Forgotten Ones\*\* 



 In a quieter but no less significant story, Akloo uncovered the plight of the “Forgotten Ones,” an ancient race of stone-skinned beings who lived in isolation after being ostracized by the Federation centuries ago.  Her report shed light on their rich culture and contributions to early interdimensional travel. By the end of her segment, public opinion began shifting toward granting them Federation membership once more. 



 \---### Chapter 9: \*\*An Attempt on the Federation President\*\*  



Tensions reached a boiling point when an assassination attempt on the Federation President, an elder dwarf named Thurrik Ironshield, rocked Alpha Jerra. Akloo, covering a routine press conference, found herself amidst chaos as magical barriers flared and guards rushed to secure the area.  “In the midst of turmoil, the Federation stands united,” she declared, her calm demeanor inspiring hope as the camera captured a city rallying together.  



\---### Chapter 10: \*\*From Anchor to Advocate\*\*  



By the end of her first season with Alpha Jerra Federation News, Ms. Akloo Meurss had become a household name. From Trollkind treaties to underwater festivals, her stories connected viewers across realms.  Her final broadcast of the season ended with a heartfelt message. “The Federation is a tapestry of stories—of struggles, triumphs, and dreams. Together, we write the narrative of our shared destiny.”  As the broadcast ended, Akloo reflected on her journey. She wasn’t just a news anchor; she was a voice for the voiceless, a beacon of truth in a vast, interconnected realm.  The Federation’s story was far from over, and neither was hers.  



\---\*\*End of Episode 1\*\*  \*\*Next Episode Teaser:\*\* 



\*What happens when Akloo uncovers a secret that threatens the very foundation of the Federation? Tune in to Alpha Jerra Federation News to find out.\*

1gqm20f,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gqm20f/navigating_rekindled_romance_after_breakup/,Navigating rekindled romance after breakup ,"Me (30F) kind of rekindled relationship with ex (31M) a couple of months ago. We ended things last summer 2023 after nearly a year. He's German and sometimes his verbal communication can be harsh and also his delivery isn't exactly the best. But he has some other great qualities, plans everything to the T so I don't have to worry about it, pays for everything, let's me know about his whereabouts and he's very handsome man although balding a bit. I honestly didn't know how to handle him at that time since he had some deaths in his family and he shut me down. I went three times to meet him and gave him the support I could, but he was still processing those feelings and even the smallest thing I did bothered him and he got verbally combative, I got very upset and instead of communicating I started packing my things up(big mistake) and he broke things off. I cried a lot and he was very upset too for shutting me down, he sent my stuff through post too. We didn't talk for nearly a year. 

I go to Vienna( where he lives) often for work and for interviews and started seeing my stories and started asking me why I'm there, I kept things casual and one day he insisted to meet me even for a few minutes if I could manage only even a coffee. I agreed but I moved to Germany at that time already but we kept in touch, he sent me pictures of his family that things had cooled down abit. 

I had to go to Budapest meanwhile where I lived before for some paperwork and said I'll pass by vienna, he offered his place for me to freshen up from travel and everything, when we met after our breakup it was sweet, he kissed my forehead multiple times and gave me the keys to his apartment and told me in German that he's happy that I'm there. When I finished my sightseeing, he came home cooked for me and I ended up staying over. 

We still kept in touch, he let's me know about his whereabouts always, send me pictures of his friends even when he's with his friends on their stag do, when he's with his dad, cooking w his mom all those things. I ended up visiting vienna again cz I had an interview there, I stayed at his apartment but the old wounds kind of opened up, he has a very bad delivery as told before and it ended up hurting me, with him saying that sometimes I expect him to do everything for me and that i struggle with basic tasks to the point where he said in the future when we have kids it would be a challenge with how i operate things, when in reality I was adjusting to his space, after listening to him complain I physically shut down after that and didn't let him touch me, I also told him that he lacks empathy and he would be a good boss but I would not have him as my partner which hurt him I guess. He didn't apologize but I was crying at night and he thought I slept so he pulled me close, kissed me, wiped my tears and pulled the covers over for me. He really struggles with verbal communication and can only show through actions while I physically block when I get upset. 

The next day morning I was still very sad with all that happened, I made breakfast and he asked me if I would stay over and try to cheer me up with some king julian memes which I love but I didn't react, when all I wanted to was just to hold him. He came downstairs to drop me off and he told me that we don't have to go through the pain and end things and wished me for my work in Vienna. I said vienna is not for me and I wouldn't want to be here( I regret that too :( but everything was just too raw) and left. I had time process everything that happened. Although what he said hurt me, he has so many other good qualities. He's actually a great guy but just struggles with intimacy generally. He still hasnt deleted my number, has kept my things still unlike last time when he sent them back and actively views my social media. I do want to give this a chance but I feel like he's at wrong here and wanted him to apologize but I ended up clearing the interview too and I might have a next round in vienna soon. 

My question is should I reach out to clear out the air when I go to his city for the interview again? Is there a future here? 

I'm sorry for the super long post, just wanted to get it off my chest :) ",1,1731528166.0,dating,1,1.0,False

I've been on this med for a few years. Most of the time, it helps fairly well. On occasion though, I get a box where the films seem way thinner and they dissolve way faster than the norm. When they come like this, they don't seem as strong. I've also had them come where they seem considerably thicker and seem to be stronger. 

These films typically take about 30 minutes to dissolve. I place it on my cheek when leaving the driveway for work. I have a 20 minute commute. By the time I get to work and get my coffee, it's just about dissolved. This current box, the films are consistently gone half way through the drive in and my pain has been much worse. 

Just wondering if anyone else ever noticed this or if I am just not trusting of the films and overthinking. ",1,1731527991.0,ChronicPain,0,1.0,False
1gqlzai,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/1gqlzai/boyfriend_found_out/,Boyfriend found out,"I've been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years now. I REALLY thought I was discreet enough around him. Everybody in his family noticed and mentioned it except him, especially his uncle.

The first time anyone said anything was at an event. We snacked in the car on the way to the event and when we arrived I went to the toilets to purge. I guess I was in there for long enough to raise suspicion because once I came out, my boyfriend's cousin was nervously laughing and there was a weird vibe to them. After the event when my boyfriend and I came home he told me his uncle was worried that I ""went into the toilets to throw up."" There was absolutely no way they heard as they weren't in the same hallway waiting for me. 
The next day we were stacking wood planks we were planning to use to build a shack on one of their lakeside properties. His uncle pulled me to the side and asked me if I've been eating and telling me I'm VERY skinny (yes, he emphasized it). 

Fast forward to about a year later I'm still considered very thin by them even though I'm still at a (lower) healthy BMI. They're all more broad-framed than I am so maybe that's why they see me like that.

Now, my boyfriend doesn't know that I know his reddit username and that I read his posts like an old man reads his newspaper while sipping coffee every morning. Today I noticed he posted on one sub saying he's worried about me. He mentioned a lot of the things I thought I was hiding well like eating a lot slower than I used to, seeing food in the trash, going to the bathroom more often despite barely drinking water and mentioned that he saw me bodychecking through a crack in the door. He stopped buying into the ""You're a bigger snacker than I am, that's why I don't eat during movie nights with you"" excuse I used to use. One thing I definitely didn't notice that he pointed out was how quiet, angry and isolated I've become. I did have a few moments last weekend where I lost my patience with him (not eating/food related) but we quickly resolved it because I don't know how to live without him anymore lol. He also mentioned our sex life's gone bland and I feel so bad he has to feel that way.

Now that friday's coming up and I'll come back home from uni I'm getting more and more nervous as each hour passes. I've been ignoring the fact that I have an exam coming up next wednesday because I've been busy practically begging chat gpt to tell me how to lie about being ok in case he confronts me about it. The issue is this goddamn machine doesn't know how to LIE. As much as I love the man, I can't let myself tell him the truth.

I know my ED is my own issue to take care of and I'm glad I have a partner caring enough to be willing to help me but it's the only way I can feel in control. Believe me I've tried ""food freedom"" and gained nothing but weight, anxiety and an even lower self-esteem. Every time I try moving out of my comfot zone with food I regress back into the same lifestyle but ten times worse. This year I went from light restriction to an attempt at living more freely then from that to eating only over the weekend and it's not even been two months since starting uni.

1gqlz7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1gqlz7r/sister_33f_cut_off_family_for_narcissistic/,Sister 33f cut off family for narcissistic husband. Advice needed ,"So where do I start? Well I 29f and my sister 33f haven’t talked in over a year. She cut off everyone in my family. Because of her narcissistic predatory husband 26M. I lived with them for a year and noticed almost immediately that something wasn’t right in that house. Her 3 kids were soooo excited for their aunty to move in. I thought it was just because they’re my nieces and nephew and they were excited to have their aunty around more. No it was because they were afraid of their stepdad. My sister also recently had his baby right before I moved in. So when my sister was at work I would help the husband with the newborn and the other kids. Well he took my kindness for something else. We would talk like normal about the kids and stuff bc they were bad sometimes. And somehow my ex would get brought up. And the husband would say “oh how could someone fumble a girl like you. No kids just both ppl starting from zero and building a life together” basically what I took from that was he wanted a woman who could his and only his. My sister has kids from different dads and that was a problem for the current husband. Then the kids started telling me how they get treated and so I know it was wrong we would talk bad about the husband behind his back in the same home. He was horrible. Eventually he would tell me! Their aunty to stop feeding them. He would get mad at the kids if I took them out somewhere to get food. If I came home with food or coffee for myself he would say “where’s mine?” Or there was one time where I came home with a Taco Bell cup and my sister was holding the baby. I was playing with the baby and he walks by and says “oh you can touch my baby but you can’t bring any Taco Bell?” 

Anyways that was all while I lived with them and more. Fast forward to now. My nephew 15M has been a runaway since June. I know for a fact it has to do with my sisters husband. She let her son run the streets for this long. He recently tried to go back home but got into an argument with his stepdad and the cops were called. I now live with my dad an hour away from where my sister lives. My dad and I had so many talks over the last couple days about what we can do to get in contact with my sister and her kids knowing that it wasn’t going to be easy. We were even preparing for my nephew to come stay with us for a little bit only for him to end up staying at that house with that man. 

My sister is completely brainwashed by this man. And she has cut off everyone in our family and the husbands family. She was really close with his mom but I found out that they don’t even talk to her anymore. My niece was very very close to me. She would tell me things she wasn’t comfortable telling her mom. Things her mom wouldn’t understand so this is why I’m so heartbroken about this situation. My niece was the main victim of all this borderline abuse as I would call it. And after I moved out and she would confide in me about what was going on while her mom wasn’t home. Well the stepdad found out and I haven’t talked to my niece in over a year. After the stepdad found messages between me and my niece. I told my sister about what her husband was saying to me while I lived there. And she never responded never called nothing. So back to the whole nephew runaway. This happened only a few days ago so I’m still feeling all the emotions. I miss my nieces and nephew so much. I’m asking if it’s worth driving down and confronting her in person? My dad says there’s no good in that because he knows I’m angry and have been for a very long time. But he also isn’t much help with this situation. He’s given Up. For good reason my sister has been the same way our whole lives. I don’t see much other option. I just want to see my niece and nephew. I feel like someone’s baby daddy begging to see their kids!! 

Sorry in advance for the long post and formatting I’m on my phone typing this out bc I’m just disappointed and feel like i have no support. Should I just give up and wait and see if she comes around?? I don’t think I can wait and I don’t think I’ll be able to let this go until I face her and speak my truth. I feel like the worst scum on this earth for not staying and protecting those kids. I feel like I turned my back on them when I always told them I will always be there for them. They can tell me anything and I will not judge them or punish them! ",1,1731527980.0,family,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1-- The gamer
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello, welcome to my post. Today I'm going to share with you my tale of how I got my wow accounts banned for hacks, after earning close to 20 million gold in 1 and a half months. Just to be clear I do deny that I use hacks, but I'm sure everyone has their thoughts on the issue. But before that lets see how we I got here in the first place. I didnt want to give out too much information about myself so I decided to focus mainly on my ""gamer"" side of life.


I no lifed almost every blizz game except for wc1, wc2, diablo 1 and diablo 4. I thought diablo 4 was a pretty good game, there wasn't anything wrong with it, but I just felt that maybe I was beginning to outgrow gaming in general, so I wasn't really as into it as previous blizz titles. I was really hyped about overwatch 2 pve but then they scrapped it which was a huge disappointment for me. I used to sneak onto my dads pc when my parents were a sleep and install blizzard games on his PC to play, and then uninstall them before they would wake up just because his PC had the better graphics card. 

I used to be abit of a nolifer, gaming for about 2-12 hours a day between the age of 10-25, playing almost every game that caught on popularity. However I am now 32 and my gaming habits have waned heavily in the past 7 years, for better or worse. I eventually stopped keeping up to date pc hardware since alot of the newer titles didn't look that appealing.  My achievements range from getting to masters in league, 5k mmr dota, 15k plat farmed in warframe (no swipes baby), and more chaos orbs than I could imagine in Path of Exile.

One day an old friend asked me if I wanted to play WoW with him. He also offered to buy me the game and a few months sub. I thought about it for a few days, then decided to get the game on my own. I was planning to buy the try WoW again soon, since the new games really didn't seem like something I would play, so I thought I would give WoW a shot.  I bought a  1 month sub first and just played some dungeons and had a good time, so i decided to get TWW. This was my first time playing wow truly, as I have tried wow about 15 years ago with a 1 month sub, but it didnt hold my appeal so I didnt get the expansion.

So here we are. I started my WoW journey. Surely with a reddit post with such a title would have more to it than just this. Well boys and girls, its time for chapter 2.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 2--The mythic tryhard.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My first month of WoW was mainly just setting up my main character, a druid healer. I heard DPS ques were long, so I wanted to pick a class that could play as both tank and healer at the same time so I could get into games and progress faster. I leveled my night elf druid from 1-70 during my first sub, before I bought the expansion, so I just kept on using that character to get to 80 using dungeons. Had a pretty good time, more fun than I was expecting. Community was quite nice, no one was really toxic or anything, aside from the occasional rage quits. Had a game where this guy didnt want to heal me at all while i was playing as a tank for most of the dungeon so everyone agreed to kick him. Good idea. 

Done all the early game fluff and did alright, mythic dungeons were out but m2+ wasnt out yet, so i just tried to get most of my mythic dailies done to prep for mythic keys which are coming out next week. 

At this stage I wasn't playing that much yet, as the questing was a big turnoff for me. I only liked playing dungeons, wasn't very big into raids either. Eventually managed to push up to m7 runs but noticed that I was losing quite alot of gold from just repair costs alone. I made about 20k gold from leveling 1-80, including the main story quests but eventually lost about 25k gold just from repairs pushing m+.

I didnt want to keep playing if I was losing that much gold, I got 20k gold from 1-80, plus 50k gold from my friend, and lost 25k gold from pushing m+ leaving me at 45k gold now. I felt that I was going to either swipe for gold if I wanted to keep this up, or just learn how to gold farm well. I tried looking around for gold guides and after much research, decided to settle on mining based off /woweconomy's recommendations. This is where the real grind begins.... 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 3-- the blue collar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the remainder of my 45k, I bought some mining gear to start out the gold grind. Cost about 8k, I dont think I can even remember what stats I went for as it was almost 1.5 months ago as I didn't stick to mining very long. There were some potions that helped, truesight I think it was called, and deftness postion? Something like that. I mined for about 10 hours at 30k per hour. Seemed alright. Could buy a token if I wanted to, but Im sure there are better uses for my gold....

And to the surprise of no one, there was. I started my first concentration enchantment build and I was able to get about 30k gold every 4 days without really playing much. Selling enchants like leeching fangs and defenders march, low cost to setup the build too costing only about 40k since enchanting you can easily catch up in kp just by paying gold (blizzard game design ofc).

I leveled like, 10 earthen alts  using a restedxp addon which puts waypoint markers to guide where to go to get exp from exploring, took me about 2.4 hours to get to level 70 and setup multiple concentration enchanters. With each of the enchanters setup, each giving about 30k per 4 days, that would mean I get 300k gold every 4 days with really just 1 hour of playing to log into each enchanter to concentration dump.

I eventually just added on blacksmithing as a second profession on all the alts, which added an extra 10k per 4 days, from concentraion alloy builds. This meant that I was earning about 400k gph, for 1 hour, every 4 days.

Sounds pretty good yes? But wait... it gets better.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 4-- weapons of mass production
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright, I eventually got sick of leveling earthens, so I decided to try and see what else is there in the gold farm world. I had about 1-2mill after about 2 weeks of ""blue collaring"". Still 2 weeks left until my wow sub is up. Not sure if I should buy a token or find something new to invest in. Looked around and found out that shattering gleaming shards is hot right now on the woweconomy discord, so I decided to take a risk and spend about 300k setting up my first non concentration crafter.

Since I need blood elf racial for this, I didnt do the exploration leveling strat, and did it by dungeons. Quite a grind but whatever, gonna pay off soon. Tried someone elses spreadsheet on shattering and realized that there were actually some pretty big mistakes in this sheet, even though it is very popular. I used this info to make my own calculator instead. I decided to keep this information a secret as telling the sheet owner that there were mistakes in their spreadsheet could lead more players into shattering, as they would realise how profitable it really is. Therefore I was planning on just keeping my calculator hidden, but since I got banned and is likely to never play wow again after this experience, I'm putting it here. 

https://www.desmos.com/calculator/balyryh4yp

This calculator calculates the ""value"" given to a maxed out shatterer, acting as a guide on which shard is the best to craft depending on the prices of the current market. Whilst it doesnt, calculate profit per hour directly, it can be modified to do so but since I'm not playing I can leave that to whoever wants to do it. The calculator in the current form is meant to highlight the best value on shards to shatter, which I find to be the most useful info anyway as many other complications can arise and when trying to calculate true gph, such as liquidity and time to sell in auction house. I will talk more about the calculator later if I feel like it, but explaining the calculator requires a wall of text of its own so ill leave that for later, but the equation is there so its easy to spot mistakes if you wanted to, do whatever you want with it since I have use for it no longer.

Regardless this actually earned me about 30-200k per hour depending on market conditions and from there it began. Not long after I was planning to buy my second wow account to craft more, and a third, and a fourth, but we will get to that in a minute. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 5--- the first auctioneer.

After hearing comments that multi boxing without software or hardware assistance isnt bannable, the decision here was simple.  Just buy more wow accounts and craft more. Hacks and mirroring isnt required since I only had to click once every 10 minutes to shatter, so iall I had to do was click every 10 mins on each client to keep crafting. This shouldnt be against tos based on what I have heard and read, but we will see about that.

One of the major issues I came across is that storm dust can sometimes be slow to sell, so you would have to play alot of auction house PvP to make sure you get the sale fast, so you can scale up faster. Auction house pvp alone deserves an entire wall of text or more to master, but the gist of it is that you should just keep posting as the most recent player who posted gets the sale. Combined with a balanced post quantity, you would be able to get better value out of each post enabling you to shut down other more casual crafters who aren't comitted to the game.

This meant that I had to spend alot of time infront of the auction house to sell alot of storm dust, so I made an account just for my auctioneer. This can be done by buying the 2 month using bnet balance since blizz doesnt offer 1 month for non subscribers (bcos blizz). This also meant that by having a seperate account just to sit in front of the auction house, I wouldnt have to pause my crafters to sell storm dust. So they could keep going, and going.

Once I had enough gold I would buy more bnet balance to upgrade my auctioneer to a crafter, using the TWW expansion, i can use the level 70 boost to setup another crafter and just buy another wow gametime for a new acount to get another auctioneer. I would do this cycle forever until I felt I couldnt sell any more storm dust, since liquidity is finite (ie no one buys more storm dust than they need).

But ofcouse, theres no rush, we are still at our first auctioneer. Lets see what happens next. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 6---the 2nd auctioneer.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Days later, more gold is gained, we get the 2nd auctioneer, making this our 3rd wow account. Money is good, lets just keep it at that. I did the grind, I did the math, I did the research, I deserved the reward. Thats what I thought. Nothing I was doing is going to get me banned. Thats what I thought.

Since I was crafting more, I decided to master more of AH PvP, as I started having more and more dust than I could sell. I learned to gauge the the liquidity of storm dust. I estimated that the median dust 1 sold per second was about 200, while the average was maybe closer to 500 per second, due to big buyers.  Dust 2 and dust 3 is abit difficult to estimate due to inconsistent liquidity. I mostly posted 111 dust per post manually using auctionator addon, as fast as I could since there was a 1 second cool down between each AH post. This is to make sure I have dust ahead of others and has a higher chance of selling than dumping 20k dust on the market at once.

I eventually learned how to use Tradeskillmaster macros to simplify the process. Its difficult to describe how the TSM macro works, but lets just say it makes it easier by just letting you do something similar by just using the scroll wheel instead of typing 111 every time you want to make a post.

Life was good, money was fast, I would just craft and post while browsing websites and watching vids, and I was making somewhere between 50-400k per hour, with little work. I earned it I thought. Everything I was doing is legit, Kaychack said it, a gold farming youtuber. ""Multi boxing isnt against tos"", everyone said it, ""no hacks and you are fine, no mirroring and you are fine"". I believed it, but little did I know things were about to change.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 7--- the 3rd and 4th auctioneer.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another day another wow account. Nothing special to the start of the day, Just the usual. Browsing some memes, crafting some crafts, making the millions. I was making. Some techniques were refined. Evertyhing seemed fine. I usually go kul tiran death knight so I can start in stormwind and start auctioning quickly.

I became better at AH pvp, learning to play during peak times when the whales are liberated from their day jobs to fund their addiction to storm dust. When the market slowed I would stop playing, since it would hardly be worth it. I would stop crafting during offpeak hours so I wouldnt hold too much dust, as that was risky due to the volatility of the price. Once I had to spend 3 hours infront of the auction house to get rid of dust due to over production and poor liquidity.  I found weekends to be slow since the players are more spread out in their routine, there is no surge in liquidity that weekday peak hours provide.

Not much to say here, just making the gold, and after about 1-2 weeks from my first shatterer, I have 4 wow accounts, 3 which are crafters and 1 auctioneer and 7 million gold. All farmed legit, no hacks, no bots, no cheats, nothing. Hate to admit it but I was actually having a good time playing WoW, a game I never thought I would enjoy. I did make a few mistakes here and there but despite that money was good, like when I used my boost on a character on the wrong realm, making it impossible for my auctioneer to mail him the stock to craft. This can be fixed by ofcourse, paying abit of gold for a realm transfer.

Im happy, but is Blizz happy, that I'm happy? 

Ofcourse it wouldnt be a permaban saga without atleast 1 permaban right? Did I spoil the ending? Maybe. Stay tuned. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 8--- the ban
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Started out just like any other day, went to get some snacks while my crafters be crafting. Was playing stormwind parkour with my auctioneer while my crafters be crafting. Funny about the jump mechanics in this game, its hard to make precise jumps between small platforms. Perhaps a joystick/game pad is required to improve my performance. What if a gamepad procs warden? Preban me, this idea would have never crossed my mind. Postban me, is a very different person.

Oh my mind has been led astray once more. Ofcourse I dont use gamepads for wow, but lets focus on the tale at hand. The ban, thats what we are all here for right. Why I stand infront of the jury today, to gain the approval of my peers. The judge. The GMs. Warden. Those who are to assess my character and my honesty.

Well lets get to it.

Boom, mid session, account closed, Perma banned. Which account was closed? 4th auctioneer. He was holding 7 million gold.

The reason? Hacks. No warning, no anything, just hacks, seemed like an automated message from blizzard.

Ofcourse now Im mad as hell, since I know what I did on my account but no one else does, crying on forums seemed ineffective. I did try alittle bit but it got shut down by mods quite quickly.

Some more sympathetic communities said things like ""just appeal bro ur sure to get unbanned if ur story is true xoxo"".


Well lets see! Ofcourse we will always see.

I tried to narrow down things that may have procced the ban. I speculated between crafting cartels, griefer bots who mass report random players for fun, etc etc. But eventually I narrowed it down to this post down here, which I made a day ago.

https://www.reddit.com/r/woweconomy/comments/1godyq3/bans_from_scroll_inactive_windows_when_hovering/

While blizzard will never tell me exactly what procced the ban, for whatever reason, seeing as many players have gotten this ban I am convinced this is the main reason.

I also played very long hours on certain days, with atleast 1 of my days going over 24 hours with lots of coffee and another 2 being around 20 hours each. Some may say this is unhealthy, but it has been years since I no-lifed a game, and this isnt my usual behaviour, and is likely to just be a peak in playtime during an ecxiting period in my WoW career.



3 hours later wow 1 (my main account) got hit with a 14 day suspension for RMT. I believe this was procced because I sent gold from auctioneer 4 to wow 1 (or crafter 1) to buy a token since his sub was running out.

Well thats the end of chapter 8. Lets see how the appeal goes. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 9--- the appeal
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright lets go boys, time to fight for justice, being the ultra naive blizzard fanboy I am, I'm sure this would be overturned quite quickly. Surely it was just some mistake.

Seeing as that was how I interpreted the situation, I didn't think I had to put much effort in my appeal. I made a short appeal saying that there must be a mistake, could someone please at blizz please doublke check that this is not the case?

First appeal got responded by an automated message, saying stuff about the TOS.

After a bump saying the matter is not resolved, 3 days later GM Xyrililath gave a generic response that there was no mistake, and the bans are unlikely to be overturned. He also told me that further appeals would be ignored.

Being the gamer that I am I sent a second appeal regardless, criticising Xyrililath's performance in assessing the matter, and leaving him with a negative review on the blizzard customer service survey.

Dont hate the player, hate the game... master as they say.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 10--- the securities team.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So here we are, wow 4 perma banned and and wow 1 has a 14 day ban. All my other accounts are still up. Still I played alittle but I didnt go as hard as I used to. Still on the fence about quitting the game, I still played alittle bit. I thought to myself if blizzard could resolve this, maybe ill lift my personal embargo I have placed on blizzard and continue buying their products.

My 2nd appeal got a response saying that they are pushing this matter to the ""security team"". A few days later, I got my response. It seemed like an automated response, so I'm not going to bother posting these types of posts on imgur. Most players know what they look like. On the plus side however, the security team reduced my permaban to a 6 month ban.

I guess I got something, but eh whatever.

The email didn't say I couldn't re appeal, so , well, here we go again. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 11--- the 2nd appeal, or was it 3rd? 4th? Not sure . Maybe 5th?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So just another few days, thinking of how I could appeal to blizzard, I presented my case about why I thought I was banned. Tried to keep it short and simple. Felt I was spending way too much time on this.

 GM  Verdaniih eventually replied and said that the 14 day suspension on wow 1 was over turned but wow 4 still had 6 months. 

I guess progress maybe who knows what this is called but, progress is an ok word to use for this outcome.

4 hours later they update the same ticket saying that there was some ""confusion"" as the review was not fully completed and now wow 1, 2, 3 and 4 has all got 6 month suspensions.

After that I decided thats enough. I just send another appeal, saying that my story is the same, and I would like another appeal.

Not going to essay dump on my blizzard appeal since I doubt they will even read it, I have entered the acceptance stage of the grieving process. Since I'm unlikely to play again even if  the ban is overturned and even if the gold was returned, I'm likely out of the game since blizzard can take things away so easily and mercilessly cause heartache. 

I'm just going to keep doing half assed appeals until they tell me to stop, but I can't say for sure I'll be back. If you want to experience your own rags to hacks saga, I left the profit calculator up there for you so perhaps you could experience the suffering I have endured. Farewell, blizzard has freed me.

Recently I got a Tonal (highly recommend!) and have been lift weights on it for almost 6 months now.  These workouts primarily consist of upper body workout with the occasional ab and lower legs mixed in.  I started at 3 days a week and now in the last month I've worked up to lifting weights for 4 days and riding the Peloton twice a week.  I've seen massive gains in my muscle mass as I've gained 3 inches in my biceps and 3 inches in my chest.  The tonal says I've gained over 25% more strength in the last 6 months and I feel great!

  
What I've not been able to do is get rid of the belly fat.  I eat healthy, drink only water and restrict my diet to around 1500 calories a day with a concentration on high protein.   I'm not perfect and I occasionally have a cheat day, but I do intermitted fasting most days.  My normal day usually consists of: Wake up and have my morning coffee, workout around 10am, Usually don't eat lunch but If I do its high protein, Eat a big dinner, lastly I have a bowl of cereal before bed.  

  
I don't know if there is anything that I can do to target this belly fat.  Do i need to eat more?  More cardio? Target Ab workouts?  Do I just need to give it more time?

1gqlnek,https://www.reddit.com/r/synology/comments/1gqlnek/moving_drives_from_one_nas_to_another/,Moving drives from one NAS to another,"I have two five-bay NASs (each is DS1515+ series, DSM 7.2.x, RAID 6, one storage pool, unencrypted volumes). NAS1 has seen better days, so I want to decommission it but I don't want to lose the data it has. NAS1 failed, so I just moved all five drives to the other and that worked fine. I then had the bright idea of replacing the old HDDs with the new ones one-by-one so I could grow the storage pool. That worked ... for drives 2-5. Each of these replacements took about 10 hours, but everything worked after I deactivated each drive, shut down the NAS, replaced it with the bigger HDD, and tested. After each drive replacement and storage pool adjustment, I could reach the NAS at the static IP address I'd given it, access the data on the drive, no user accounts were deleted, etc, etc. I couldn't actually enlarge the storage pool yet but I figured it would work fine after I replaced the first drive. So far, so good!

Then I replaced drive 1 (the fifth drive for me). After the 10 hours or so, I couldn't reach it at the static IP address. It was beeping regularly, which I thought I'd disabled for this operation. I used Synology Assistant and found it was at a new DHCP IP address. It didn't seem to be reset - the admin password was set already and I didn't have it. And it didn't seem to have the custom accounts I'd created before, and I couldn't view the data using the previous network share names. And I couldn't stop the beeping. Yikes! I wasn't completely freaked out, but I shut it off until morning when I'd have some coffee until I could figure out how to stop the beeping.

This morning, it was still beeping, but I noticed it had a different name in the login screen (NAS2 instead of NAS1). This of course meant there were a separate set of credentials in a separate password file. I was able to find the admin password, log in, and stop the beeping. Great! However, Storage Manager says that the storage pool is empty. It sees all the drives, shows they're ready, and gives me the option to ""Online Assemble"" the drives into the storage pool. But when I try that, I get an ""Assemble failed"" message.

https://kb.synology.com/en-us/DSM/tutorial/Storage\_pool\_online\_assemble\_failed

There are clearly a sufficient number of drives to continue. I figure it has something to do with my previously using the new NAS before I decided to do this.

So, I have three questions:

1. Is there a way to upgrade the size of my NAS1 storage pool by migrating all the drives from NAS2 to NAS1?

2. How can I tell NAS1 it's really NAS1 instead of NAS2?

3. Can I do a full reset of NAS2 to reconfigure it as NAS1, using the new drives, without losing any data?

Also, any other advice is welcome. Thanks in advance!

Looking for hope lol,"About 3 weeks ago we started noticing roaches (Florida duplex, lived here 3 years with no issue, thinking maybe the hurricane and water build up brought them in). 2 weeks ago I saw them run under the fridge so I pulled it out and hated what I saw. Found a colony of them (maybe ~20 or so) and sprayed/killed them all.

I started cleaning like a mad woman and put boric acid everywhere. Also caulked the crappy base boards around my fridge. Found this reddit a few days later and started ordering stuff. 

Used gel bait but it was drying up. Finally said screw it and got the Alpine. 

5 days days ago I sprayed Gentrol Aersol. 4 days ago I did the Alpine WSG, put out some point sources, and put out Advion baits along with sticky traps. 

I've found about 10 dead roaches/nymphs/babies total. I came home from a 3 day trip today and found 1 pregnant one on the trap under my fridge and 2 teenagers on a trap under my stove (1 with crinkly wings). 

Is this a good sign? I'm planning on spraying Alpine again this weekend (at the 7 day mark). I'm hopeful but I found a shell of an eggsac on my counter when I got home and it's reignited my paranoia. 

I cleaned out the front and back of my stove and fridge the best I could (including diassembling) but I'm sure there are still a couple in there. I've also sealed up ALL the holes and baseboards cracks from my landlord's shotty reno work.

I'm hoping another treatment of alpine will knock them out. Afterwards, my neighbors will be using the same thing to treat their side (though they haven't seen any yet).

I tried online dating for a bit but it's so hard to gauge chemistry online vs chemistry in person. I haven't really made any effort to get back out there. 

But something happened a week ago. I went to my local grocery store to pick up a few things and by the time I went to checkout, there was apparently a store wide network outage so none of the registers worked, no one could pay for their food. We all were waiting for the network to come back up.

So the lines were backing up, and everyone was standing around starting to become increasingly agitated and the store manager (who I had never seen before and I've been shopping at this store for 4 years) is telling people he's sorry for the inconvenience and a lot of older folks in my vicinity were starting to verbally complain so I started to make a few jokes and chatted with the high maintenanced ones to keep them from yelling at the manager and staff who aren't IT people, they were just waiting for their IT department to fix the issue. 

The manager keeps walking by me and hears me making jokes and talking to the older folks and gives updates on the situation and joins the conversation in between delegating tasks to his employees. I start to actually look at him and realize I'm attracted to him, wondering if he's married or in a relationship. Don't see a wedding ring. 

This is a surprising reaction for me because I haven't really felt any physical attraction to anyone I interact with on a daily basis since I lost my partner. Like even entertaining those thoughts hasnt happened yet until now I guess. 

Anyway, about 45 minutes later the checkout machines start working again and he comes up to me after I check out to give me a high five for ""being awesome"" and deescalating the environment and I just froze and said ""I'm glad I could help"" and then didn't know what else to say, so I just left. 

It left an impression on me so much so I went in the next day, didn't see him around at all, but I asked one of the older women staff members what his name was and if they knew if he was married or not. They told me his name and chuckled and said no he isn't married. Not currently dating anyone either to their knowledge. And then I asked if he was gay (to make sure I wasn't barking up the wrong tree), and they chuckled again, said no, he's had girlfriends before. 

Since then, I've gone into the store a few times this week to see if I'd catch him on the floor at all, and haven't seen him at all, so there's no way for me to naturally go up to him and introduce myself and chat with him. 

I'm pretty sure the managers stay in the back of house unless there's an emergency so I feel like my brief interaction with him was a fluke occurrence. Literally never saw him before that network outage. There seems to be a really low chance of ever being able to organically chat with him more unless I deliberately ask one of the staff members to call him to the front. Is that inappropriate or creepy to do though?


What would people do in this situation? Would you just wait to see if he ever shows up on the floor and if you don't see him, just chalk it up to a nice interaction and not pursue it?  Would you ask the staff to call him to come out? Would someone be flattered by that or be weirded out by someone introducing themselves/asking them out for coffee? 

I'm so rusty at this/frankly was never good at this, I'm usually pretty shy but something about this guy just piqued my interest, so just curious what others would do.

It's been hinted in Amanda 1 that Amanda the Adventurer was a live action show before Hameln turned it into a cartoon (this is when Sam said they were turning the show into one during the coffee talk tape in Amanda 1), so do you think one of the tapes in the third game could show the show as it was originally? Like as a kind of cute but sad way to show Rebecca's life before she was trapped.

What if that's what the unlabeled tape Riley has in the ending is? A snippet of the live action show?

If we did see the live action version, I imagine it would just be like a normal preschool show with nice, family-friendly lessons the whole town could enjoy since they really liked the show before Hameln.

Wooly would probably be the plush from the library Rebecca would hold or a puppet controlled and maybe voiced by Sam or Kate that Rebecca would speak to like in Sesame Street. The snippet we see in the third game could end with Sam hugging Rebecca and telling her he loves her or him or Rebecca saying something directly to Riley in whatever secret room we'll go to in the third game.

Aurora does a cold brew, but they are literally the only place we've found so far that will just give us cold, black, coffee. Starbucks will do it, but I'm not a fan of huge chains.

We make it at home, but if we are out and about I'd love more than one option in an hour radius of us.

For context, my family all have WFH tech or sales jobs and have done very well for themselves.  Fitness and health play a central role in their lives. Which is great.  Now I am assuming a bit, but I’ve never witnessed any of them struggle to maintain a healthy weight. 

During the function, everyone added their 2 cents on things like ozempic face, long term side effects and overall “no quick fixes are good.”  I kept quiet. As someone who has struggled with weight for most of my life I feel strongly that I shouldn’t comment on the physical journey of others.  In my teens and 20s I could manage to lose weight if I maintained extreme focus. My early 30s it started to slip and now I’m on zepbound, 3rd month, 5.  I’ve lost 30 pounds so far and I’m really starting to feel better.  

Had coffee with my dad over the weekend where he asked if I was intentionally losing weight which just felt like an odd question.  I said yes but didn’t go into detail. I’m nervous about thanksgiving. To the point where my husband and I have a plan for him to take my plate and finish or toss it discreetly.

I LOVE iced coffee. My favorite coffee shop, unfortunately, is a 20 minute drive to the downtown area and while that might not seem like much, it is to me when I just want a small cup of coffee 😅 it’s not a chain either, it’s very localized so I love going there to show my support for a small business. I always get an iced latte and add mocha.

I also like Starbucks from time to time, but the last time I got a drink from there, it was SUPER sugary—which it had never been before—to where I couldn’t even finish it because it was giving me a headache. It’s also pricy for me. Not hating on anyone that likes Starbucks because I used to be obsessed with it! Everyone has their own personal preferences so please don’t start a debate over this in the comments ❤️

So I decided to start making my own coffee at home! This should’ve been a simple solution from the start, but I was never sure on what ingredients to buy because there’s so many different brands and flavors. But the other day, I realized all I have to do is search up the ingredients for my favorite coffee drink, so that’s exactly what I did. I searched up the ingredients for a simple iced vanilla latte (my favorite drink of all time): Starbucks dark roast, vanilla syrup, and milk. Bought those ingredients from the grocery store this past weekend. Made it for the first time the other day and it is SO GOOD! I also get up early in the morning for school so having a lil drink to motivate me makes it so much easier  💗

And I know not everyone is a Christian, but I also have a weekly “ritual” I do every Sunday morning where I wake up and have a lil drink to sip on while watching my church’s livestream online. It’s literally my favorite part of the week. I used to go to a fast food restaurant each week to get my drink, but now I can stay home and make my own!

So, no surprise, I'm terrified of flying.  When I was a kid, I loved it.  Flew across the globe, happy camper hitting turbulence.  Thought it was fun.  Then in my 30s I became paralyzed by fear.  I avoided air travel for years, but my job requires it so to push through, I tried acute anxiety meds, but they made me a little too loosy goosy, and the ""hangover"" was worse than the fear of flying.  

Then I tried meditation and that really started my own path of being okay with what my autonomic nervous system considers taking unnecessary risks.  I also avoid coffee and make sure to hydrate. I upgrade to economy plus whenever I can to alleviate the mad scramble to find a spot for my carry-on.  Also, I love the onboard tracking where we can see the GPS and flight speed, etc. 

But the real magic came for me when--and this is where the possible TRIGGER kicks in, so I apologize in advance.  But once I finally became okay with my own mortality, all fear of flying seemed to decrease-a lot.  That's it.  That's me sharing the only real thing that works for me.  Being ""safe inside my heart"" in case it all ends.  I mean I take all kinds of other risks every day and don't think twice about them.

I mean it's an ever-evolving journey and I'm not magically cured, but last week, when I flew and there were some stressful moments of turbulence, boarding a plane and having to disembark to get on another plane due to mechanical issues, delays, being sneezed on my multiple fellow passengers, etc. But my heart rate and stress response were not once triggered and it's mostly because I told myself that I was at peace with my own vulnerable existential state.

One challenge, though, is the difficulty of getting out of bed and starting my day. It’s not exactly depression; it’s more a lack of motivation to get up. I find myself hiding in sleep to escape my thoughts for a little while. My sleep schedule is also messy: I sleep from midnight to 4 a.m., then go back to bed around 6 and wake up anywhere from 11 a.m. to as late as 1 p.m. Given that I’m in my late 50s, I know my sleep isn’t going to be what it was decades ago. I take Clonazepam, Trazodone, and edibles to help with sleep, but no matter what I try, I wake up at 4 a.m., walk the dog, have some coffee, read the news, then go back to sleep. It’s a cycle I can’t seem to break.

Hello again,

I've already posted here a number of times, so long story short: we are a group of more or less athletic people meeting every Sunday at 11:00 AM at Park Gleisdreieck to play some Touch Rugby.

Don't be fooled by the name, there's hardly any contact involved, not with other players nor with the ground (look at how clean everyone is on the picture!). No previous experience is actually desirable since we teach the rules from scratch at the beginning of every session. 

Basically, if you're keen on running and passing a ball around, just come down! All you need is a bottle of water and some somewhat grippy running shoes (boots are fine but definitely not mandatory).

1gqksbi,https://i.redd.it/h9f47x7qwp0e1.jpeg,Starting my specialty coffee journey - A recap of the past month,"So I am posting this here as just an open diary/discussion of how I got into this vortex of “specialty coffee” and what have I learned so far in the past month or so since trying to brew my own coffee as a 20 something year old now living in Delhi.

Feel free to help me out with some tips or suggestions in terms of brewing techniques or gear or anything in general.

So I used to live in Mumbai where I worked as a music producer and often went out to get a cup of coffee at a nearby cafe (they have a lot of those) for meetings or just hanging with a friend and as it is for almost anyone before starting this frenzy, I was just a fan. 

A fan of how coffee tasted, how calming was it to be at a cafe with nice decor and the whole vibe that comes with it and that got me in. But I still wasn’t “in” cause i knew nothing about coffee per say. Just what item on the menu I liked (it was mocha, i know) and also just making Nescafe Gold before hitting the gym.

How I got into understanding coffee and realising that I can make my own “high quality” coffee at home happened in a moment of pure universe coming together (cheesy but true) where I had to move to Delhi and I felt the thing I would miss the most about Mumbai is it’s growing coffee culture and ease of access to any cafe I liked.

So one week before moving, I am in Oshiwara, Andheri for some work and I notice this cafe on the street called “Kruti Coffee” –
which now i know is a specialty coffee roaster from Koratput, Odisha who have their own cafe
and I sit in there and notice they have a bunch of manual brewers on the shelf, none of which i didn’t even know the names of then like your Chemex, v60 etc. 

So I order my coffee and it’s exquisite, its better than any normal or cafe style cup of coffee I have ever tasted. It was like a world of new flavours in my mouth than just the taste of plain old “coffee”. So I go up to the guy there and ask what is this “specialty coffee” and why does it taste so different than I previously have and he tells me the jist, you all know. Tries to sell me a Chemex in the process but I digress.

So now I move to Delhi, and there are no such cafes near me where I can go and have actual good coffee, I could find a Blue Tokai or a Third Wave nearby but still I wanted to brew my own coffee at home. So I open up my laptop, go on Youtube (this is the part im sure everyone is familiar with), type in coffee and the first name that comes up is…drum rolls..

James Hoffman.

He tells me a bunch of things I never knew about coffee, how its supposed to be an experience of different flavours that only come out when you brew a particular coffee in a particular way - and so on.

So after a week of research on Youtube, finding other channels, more sources of information including this Reddit thread. I finally decide to get a brewer and after careful analysis of all the data I gathered (this really felt like a science research) - 

I decide on the Hario Switch - It’s got both immersion and percolation. It’s easy to use, apparently makes great tasting cups of specialty coffee.

By this point I had been surfing on amazon looking for “cheap alternatives” cause I already knew this whole coffee brewing hobby wasn’t going to be cheap in any sense. But ultimately deduced that getting good equipment is the way to go here. So I said no to the “Agaro” and ordered a Timemore C3, the grinder I could realistically afford.

And finally I get some coffee — 
I ordered a taster pack from Tulum Coffee (great decision from my perspective) cause they’ve got different coffees for me to try cupping and I do the cupping as internet told me to. I analysed what I liked and what I didn’t. Mind you this was also one of the first times I was drinking “black coffee” and then I got to brewing.

So now i have gulped down all the information I could, watched atleast a 100 videos about coffee, got myself the equipment I needed now its time for brewing. 

I carefully try to make brew the coffee with my stopwatch on and anxiety running through my roof about -
“is my water the right temperature”
“is this is the grind size I’m supposed to have”
“do I bloom 45g or 60g”

— sometimes over educating yourself on a topic can be a negative thing. 

So I make my first cup of coffee and its - bad. 
What else did you expect, it tasted like piss water. But i knew I had to be doing things right, everything went as the youtube video told me it would. But it still didn’t taste great. 

I get into making another cup by trying to dial it in better than the last time, and the taste improves! Voila! I’ve made my first decent cup of coffee. 

So now I’m two weeks into this messed up and expensive and tedious and time consuming hobby of brewing specialty coffee — 
—   and I love it.

It’s not easy but brewing your own cup of coffee but the magic of it is,
from grinding beans to just sitting there and waiting those 3 minutes for that pour over to drain the water through the coffee bed has something of a blissful and therapeutic quality to it. 

And now we’re here.

Im looking up different roasters in India, trying to see what coffees I like the best, already budgeting for an Aeropress or maybe a Picopresso. Looking for good Cafes in Delhi to maybe try some more good specialty coffee.

If you made it till the end, hope you enjoyed my story and could relate to it when you started out. 

Again you can tell me about how you started and any mistakes which you now know better about. Let me know.

And have a great cup of coffee everyone!",7,1731524970.0,IndiaCoffee,1,0.82,False

I have already been evaluated by a doctor and am coming to a cross roads.  
  
I've had a degree of anxiety my entire life but recently things have gotten out of control and I don't know why. For the past two months I have been overwhelmed with anxiety and panic attacks everyday. It doesn't end. There is nothing pressing on my mind that is causing this, as my life is the best that is has ever been. I am not depressed, have a great support network, good job, nice residence etc. but everyday I am randomly breaking into panic and am unable to be myself because I am so tense.

I have been seeing a therapist that I love on and off for several years now and he has never seen me like this either. I've had bouts of high anxiety and panic for at most a few days in the past, but these were a result of excessive alcohol consumption. I have no problem being sober, though in the past I definitely used alcohol as form of self medication for my anxiety before I knew I actually had anxiety. Ever since this recent episode started happening, I have been completely sober for almost two months now, but things are not getting better. I try to exercise daily but nothing seems to help. I have never experienced anxiety this bad in my 28 years of life.  
  
Things have gotten so bad that I went to the doctor for the first time in my life and was prescribed medication to treat the symptoms: Hydroxyzine - an antihistamine to make me sleepy, and Propranolol - a beta blocker that blocks adrenaline. These medications are to be taken as needed but I need them everyday to function and even then, I still have severe anxiety while on the medication. My doctor says that if I continue to need these everyday, SSRIs are the only option. I really don't want to be on SSRIs but i don't know what to do to make this all stop. The anxiety/panic has put severe strain on my newfound relationship  and is impacting every part of my life. I cant even drink a coffee without breaking into a panic. I cant drive without breaking into a panic. My palms and feet and constantly sweating. My body is stuck in fight or flight mode.

Again, i don't know why this is happening. If anyone has any tips for managing this, it would be greatly appreciated.",1,1731524929.0,Anxiety,3,1.0,False

I (21f) ave a crush on one of my coworkers (23m)(he's going to quit soon because the whole place is BS, we've talked about how the owners have effed him over and he's looking for a new job) 
Soo I've been trying to figure out how to get across to him that I really like him, before he leaves and we don't work together anymore. 


I have his number, and I texted him once before asking about the recipe for a sandwich ingredient. He answered my question, and told me where the recipe book in the kitchen is (I mostly work in the front and not in the kitchen/bakery so i didn't know about the recipe book) I said ""thanks"", and he said ""no problem,"" and that was that.


My first thought when I got the call from the owner was to text him about it, like ""I'm official Cafe Plant Caretaker now, idk how to keep plants alive, I should have asked for a raise lmao"" something like that...
 I thought maybe that would be a good way to start conversation hahahaha
But now i'm scared that it would just be weird. 

We barely work together (like once a week at the most) but we closed together yesterday, and he remembered from over a week ago a certain band I told him I liked, and he put them on the speakers while we were closing. He also remembered that I had texted him about the recipe (which was like 8 days ago) and brought it up last night. He's super nice and we have good conversation, I like him a lotttt, I'm just autistic and idk how to flirt with people, or how to tell if they're flirting with me:(

Downtown Vancouver is a small area, mostly made up of newcomers. Very few local B.C.-born residents can afford to live there and generally treat it as a place to visit occasionally rather than a full-time home. It’s expensive, and unless you’re regularly using the seawall, heading up to the local mountains, or attending Canucks games, it’s not the most practical financial choice. Many friends who grew up in Vancouver and surrounding areas have moved away. Even those with strong incomes find that, unless you’re single and earning over $150K per year, getting ahead and saving for the future is challenging.

That said, you've chosen to live in Vancouver so here are some tips:

\- join Facebook singles groups.  These are free, include pub nights, games, etc.

\-get comfortable sitting at a bar, chatting with the bar tender.  You will secure a regular position, and get used to the usual folks to attend the bar..when a person of interest comes in, make your move and chat with her/him.

\-Listen  and ask for honest feedback. If you’re not cool with that, then you’re probably not ready to deal with your issues. A friend or even someone you just met shouldn’t have any problem giving you unbiased suggestions—maybe the comb-over isn’t working, or your glasses are wack...whatever the case, be prepared for brutal honesty, and thank everyone who gives you tips.

\-Stay in shape.  Along with being the ONLY known factor that can reduce your chances of cancer, fit people are attractive and tend to gain the most attention. Is what it is.

\-Get on the apps.  Date often, date everyone..lower your bar to include EVERY type of person you may want to date.  At the worst, you will walk away with some new friends. Limit all 1st dates to 10-15min coffee dates..just in case youre not feeling it and need to exit.

\-Put yourself out there. Get uncomfortable, until you are not. Be great at conversations with strangers..all shapes and types..not only ones you want to date.

I met some of my ex's at: the gym, partying at bars, Bumble,  coffee shops, IKEA (end of the month :) )

He said that I can only have family and close friends as visitors during the day, just for dinner or coffee. There was nothing in the contract restricting visitors, and even so, it seems unreasonable to prohibit someone from having visitors.

To be clear, I am not thinking about huge parties, or giving guitar lessons or something. Only, say, inviting a friend for a coffee or for dinner.

Could anyone please clarify what rights a tenant has regarding having guests over when renting a room in a house ?

Are there any specific laws or guidelines I should be aware of? Any insight much appreciated ! Thanks.",2,1731523943.0,ESLegal,1,1.0,False

I was up to about 4-5 cups of coffee per day at work, and I'd have an energy drink Friday/Saturday nights to help me stay up a bit later. 

Over the past few years, my stress levels at work were constantly high, I was always worrying about stuff, couldn't ever settle down. I figured it was just typical anxiety/depression symptoms. Oh, and I was sweating like crazy too: sedentary office job, air conditioner going, and I'd still be sweating through my clothes. 

In April of this year I finally talked to my doctor about my mental health and long story short I got on some meds. He told me for them to be the most effective, I'd need to reduce caffeine (cut out if possible), along with weed. 

I actually managed to quit caffeinated coffee almost immediately. It only took about two days for me to realize how much less I was sweating. That was the thing that motivated me the most. The other thing I noticed was that I was staying more calm in stressful situations. I still have a long way to go, but the sky isn't constantly falling anymore. 

It took another couple months to stop drinking energy drinks on the weekends. As soon as I would have one, I could feel my heartrate explode, started sweating, and the anxiety would kick in, then I wouldn't even enjoy my evening. 

So, I last consumed caffeine in early September. I sweat significantly less, I feel more calm, I'm better at taking a step back and thinking about things before having immediate negative reactions. Now I just need to work on weening myself off the weed.",9,1731523878.0,decaf,2,0.91,False

Just a cup or two to start, but over the years it grew to an average of 4-5 cups per day. I was good about stopping by noon and for the most part, didn’t have sleep issues. I’ve had anxiety for as long as I can remember, starting before caffeine, so I don’t think caffeine is the source of my anxiety, but it probably adds to it.

Two or three years ago I started developing sleep issues. I fall asleep fast and get 5 solids hours in before I wake up at 3 in the morning, wide awake, head spinning with everything I need to do or worrying about things I can't control. I typically get out of bed, eat a protein bar, and read until I’m ready to try sleeping again. Then, I get junk sleep for a couple of hours before the alarm goes off at 6:30ish.

So, I decided to eliminate caffeine. I took one month to back down from 4 cups to zero. I’m now over 3 weeks with no caffeine. I haven’t been perfect as I’ve had a Halloween-sized (mini) candy bar here and there. No soda's, decaf coffee, or tea. 

My observations. For some reason, the best sleep I’ve got throughout this process was the week I went from 2 to 1 cups of coffee.

The first week completely off caffeine was manageable. I believe weaning helped. I was tired with dull headaches, needed naps, and had occasional concentration issues. I slept better, almost through the night.

Week 2 – energy and concentration came back, no headaches, and I was sleeping well but not through the night; maybe a solid 6 to 7 hrs.

Week 3 – I’ve felt rough/tired and I’m back to sleeping from 10-3 then wide awake. Concentration is good, energy levels seem good.

Maybe this is going to take months to get to some level of normal/for my body to fully recover?

Any thoughts or advice from similar experiences would be appreciated.

1gqk7h6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamondsreview/comments/1gqk7h6/the_four_cs_of_diamonds_expert_tips_for_smart/,The Four C's of Diamonds: Expert Tips for Smart Buying,"The Four C's—Cut, Color, Clarity, and Carat—serve as the universal standard for evaluating diamond quality, established by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA). Cut quality, widely considered the most influential factor, determines how well a diamond captures and reflects light, directly impacting its brilliance and sparkle.

Understanding these four characteristics helps buyers make informed decisions between diamonds at different price points. For example, choosing a slightly lower color grade in a well-cut diamond often provides better value than prioritizing color at the expense of cut quality.

This practical guide explains how each of the Four C's affects a diamond's appearance and value, with specific examples and expert recommendations for finding the optimal balance within your budget.

# Bottom Line:

Understanding the Four C's—Cut, Color, Clarity, and Carat—is crucial for anyone looking to purchase a quality diamond:

* Cut: The most critical factor, affecting brilliance and light performance. Aim for Excellent or Ideal cut for optimal sparkle.
* Color: Ranges from D (colorless) to Z (light yellow).
* Clarity: Refers to internal or external flaws, ranging from FL (flawless) to I3 (included level 3).
* Carat: Reflects diamond weight and impacts size. Remember, higher weight means higher price, but appearance is also influenced by cut and shape.
* There are more factors to take into consideration - fluorescence, measurements, diamond shape and more. Don’t finish your research at the 4c’s if you want to make an informed decision.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing from trusted retailers which provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

# Who is this for?

* First-time diamond buyers looking to understand quality factors
* Anyone wanting to make an informed diamond purchase
* Individuals aiming to balance quality and budget in their diamond selection

# Who is this not for?

* Those prioritizing trends over long-term quality and value
* Buyers looking to make a quick purchase without considering key quality factors
* Individuals already well-versed in advanced diamond grading

# Recommendations for Smart Buying

1. Prioritize cut quality for maximum brilliance
2. Color: For natural diamonds with best overall balance and value, look in the I-G (near-colorless) ranges. For lab-grown diamonds, do not compromise and look for E-D.
3. Always make sure you pick an eye-clean diamond. For natural diamonds with the best balance, look for VS2 clarity and higher. For lab-grown diamonds, you can get a VS1 or even VVS at a much more affordable price.
4. Balance carat weight with other factors for best overall appearance
5. Always get a certified diamond from reputable labs like GIA, AGS or IGI
6. Use online tools to compare diamonds across different retailers
7. Don't hesitate to ask for expert advice or clarification

# FAQ

Q: Which C is most important?

A: Cut is generally considered most crucial as it affects the diamond's sparkle and overall appearance.

Q: Can I see the difference between color grades?

A: Subtle differences exist, especially in higher grades. Most people can't distinguish between D-F colors.

Q: How does carat weight relate to size?

A: Carat measures weight, not size. A well-cut 1-carat diamond may appear larger than a poorly cut 1.2-carat stone.

Q: Are inclusions always bad?

A: Not necessarily. Many inclusions are invisible to the naked eye and don't affect a diamond's beauty.

Q: Should I always go for the highest grades in all Four C's?

A: Not always. Balancing the Four C's often provides better value than maxing out all categories.

Remember, while the Four C's provide a framework, personal preference plays a significant role. Take time to view diamonds in person or through high-quality images to find what appeals most to you.

The problem:
However, I think the problem is I look intimidating daw. Someone I know told me na mahirap daw pumasok sa mundo ko kasi nakakatakot saw guluhin 'yon kasi I'm someone daw na who knows what she wants to achieve in life.

Plus, I'm a busy college student so minsan lang talaga ako lumabas ng bahay. Usually, bahay and school lang ako. Nakakalabas lang ako kapag may need asikasuhin for our school organization and kapag may event na kasama yung org namin.

What I've tried so far:
Whenever I'm free, lumalabas ako with my friends o kaya I go out on a date with myself. Nag-iikot lang sa mall or tatambay sa coffee shop.

I even tried dating apps kaso it's not my thing talaga. Paulit-ulit lang kasi yung tinatanong ng lahat. Where I live? What's my course? How old I am? Nakakasawa.

I do all of the shopping for the home. Everything for holidays or events. I do all of the cleaning. My husband doesn’t help clean at all. And he’s messy, doesn’t clean up after himself so I’m constantly cleaning up after him and the kids all day. On top of this, I’m still breastfeeding the youngest.
I do laundry every single day, it never ends. I sweep, mop, vacuum daily. Usually, multiple times a day since I’m home with the kids and they make a mess. Take care of the kids all day. Take care of the finances for the flip house, do all the interior designing and layout for the houses, buy all fixtures and everything needed, schedule contractors. Search for new homes and put bids in, do all the paperwork for buying the homes and do all the realtor work for selling the home.
I have no help, no family that come and help me with the little ones so I’m usually dragging them along with me to the tile store or flooring, meetings, showings etc.

A few years ago, Tom cut ties with me, Sarah (31 F), and the rest of our friend group because his fiancée didn’t like any of us. At the time, it was really hurtful, but we all kind of moved on and let it go. We haven’t heard from him since.

Recently, I found out that Tom is getting married, and it turns out that he uninvited Sarah from the wedding at the last minute—because his fiancée still doesn’t like her. This really hit home for me, as Sarah is married now and had invited Tom to her wedding a while back, and he actually attended. It just feels really unfair that Sarah is now being excluded, especially since Tom had no problem attending her wedding and was clearly willing to put aside his fiancée’s issues with her back then.

To make things even more frustrating, the invitations Tom sent out for his wedding were last minute to begin with. So, Sarah was originally invited, then uninvited because of his fiancée. It seems like Tom is once again choosing his fiancée over long-time friendships, and I can’t help but feel like he’s repeating the same behavior that caused him to lose contact with all of us in the first place.

I’m really tempted to call Tom out on this. I feel like he needs to be held accountable for uninviting Sarah, and for the way he has treated his friends over the years because of his fiancée’s issues. But I’m also worried that reaching out after all this time will just cause drama, especially with the wedding approaching.

So, WIBTA if I confronted Tom about uninviting Sarah? Is it worth saying something, or should I just leave it alone and let him handle his own relationships?

Edit: Answering some questions to add context: 

INFO: do you know why his fiancee dislikes Sarah so much? I’m assuming you and your other friends were still invited to his wedding, so this is weird.

I think at one point the issue raised was that Sarah “acted too familiar” and “was hotter than me”.

INFO: Your friendship seems already over.   What's your goal here?

Just calling out what I feel is shitty behavior. But not scold or preach, just have a calm discussion of why this isn’t right, and even though I would want to bury the past and be friends with him, as he has asked, I fear nothing has changed and the cycle will repeat. 

Info: what do you mean by ""confront?""

Do you mean get coffee with him and say something like ""it really hurt all our feelings when you cut us out.  I'd like to re-establish a friendship, but once bitten twice shy, and your uninviting Sarah makes me feel that not much has changed, and maybe it'd be better to just accept that we go our separate ways, rather than do round 2 of the same"" - and then listen to what he says, and have a respectful honest conversation?

Yes, that's perfectly fine.

Do you mean ""start scolding him for not inviting Sarah, even though you don't know what's actually going on in the relationship?""

Not fine, and will just get you uninvited.

Option 1. Option 2 is just not my style or way.

I only discovered this recently, as my parents didn't practice the religion during my upbringing. I have relatives who are still members of the church and others who left, but it all stems from my paternal grandparents, who converted to the Church and raised their five children as members.

Why do I wish I could belong? Because everything I’ve seen from the Church, watching from the sidelines, has been positive and life-affirming. While my teens to mid-twenties were filled with irresponsibility, risk-taking, selfishness, and unhealthy living, I’m now nearly 30, with my significant other and our young daughter, and my values have shifted. I now see how a lifestyle centred around health (I’m thinking of the Word of Wisdom, though giving up tea and coffee sounds rough!), family values, and gratitude feels far superior to the lifestyle I used to live.

Also, my family members who have remained active in the Church generally appear happier than those who left or weren’t raised in it. They are healthier, work harder, and are more successful financially.

Still, I don’t think I could ever become a member. I simply can’t make myself believe in it. I won’t go into detail, but I’m referring to the origins of the church, the Book of Mormon, and other elements of its foundation and Christianity itself.

While I feel drawn to the positive, wholesome lifestyle I’ve seen in members of the Church, I find myself unable to fully embrace the faith due to my personal beliefs. Although I can appreciate the values of health, family, and gratitude that the church promotes, I ultimately can’t adopt its teachings or doctrines.

I’m a pretty social guy and love to hangout, experience new things. I’m a frequent at board game events but I just wasn’t able to find someone my age. 
Here are some points to sell myself lol : 
1. Great listener, need a yapper tho 
2. Music taste ranges from bhojpuri to frank ocean (immaculate range) 
3. Love coffee and walking, can ditch me post coffee if the vibe isn’t vibing.
4. Great personal photographer.
5. One of the best bad dancers(love dancing), parties are crazy w me.
6. Good humour (says me)

Please ping me to schedule the date later this week

1gqk0mj,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1gqk0mj/preventative_filling_of_molar_occlusional_and/,Preventative filling of molar occlusional and buccal pits-- Do I need this? (Photos in post),"40F, coffee drinker, occasional alcohol drinker, never smoker

I have had these two pit stains on my teeth for several years (occlusional and buccal). My dentist said they are ""trending towards becoming cavities, but not there yet,"" not sticky, etc. The opposing bottom first molar has the same deep pit/groove anatomy, but is not stained. My dentist recommended filling the four spots as a preventative measure. These two spots do not show up on x-rays, otherwise I would have obtained and posted them. Photos here: https://imgur.com/a/W1qDhYi

Does this seem like sound advice for treatment, or might it be overkill at this point in time? Any alternatives? Or wait and see? My concerns are losing tooth structure unnecessarily and/or prematurely. But I of course also don't want these to turn into substantial cavities.

I do clench and grind my teeth at night and have worn a guard for ~10 years. (I also had sealants as a kid, but they have worn through in spots.) For example, I wouldn't want to make my teeth more prone to cracks, etc., on a night I doze off without the nightguard.

I have only had one cavity to date, three years ago, so I would presume myself to not be especially prone to decay, and my hygiene is overall thorough and consistent.

Thanks for any advice!",1,1731523083.0,askdentists,2,1.0,False

I feel like there used to be more options before the pandemic, but this is the only place I'm familiar with inside the loop, and it's always way too packed for my liking.

I figure it's a hassle for cafes and businesses in general to be open late, but in a city as big as Houston, I feel like there has to be a huge market for this kind of thing. But can anyone share more about why this may be? And if there are more places open past midnight in Houston?",19,1731523053.0,houston,24,0.83,False
1gqk06o,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1gqk06o/virtuo_machine_question_about_coffee_temperature/,Virtuo Machine - Question about coffee temperature,"Aight yall,

We currently own a **Virtuo Round Head** machine. My ONLY issue with it, is that I wish the coffee came out hotter, and this seems to be a common theme.

This morning, on a different post, someone mentioned they have a **VirtuoPlus** and they claimed the coffee is hotter.

I spoke with an agent at Nespresso just now and they informed me the **VirtuoPlus** is a newer machine (**2018**) vs our **Virtuo Round Head** (**2014**), and also informed me there is an even newer Virtuo machine, the **Virtuo Pop+** (**2023**).

I asked them to confirm if either of the newer machines made hotter coffee and they said all 3 machines make the same temperature of coffee.

My question is, has anyone gone from the Round Head, to either the VirtuoPlus or preferably the Virtuo Pop+ and found the temperature to be warmer / hotter? (even though the company claims there is no difference)

I may upgrade to the Pop+ regardless as its a smaller / sleeker machine but would be cool to know if anyone made the swap and see what you think.

1gqju0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/1gqju0a/price_per_m2_doesnt_add_up_why/,Price per m2 doesn’t add up. Why?,"I’m trying to find out the price per m2 of a building which has a store and living space.  
I tried to calculate percentage of either part and the m2 price for the building as a whole and then determine the percentage of store and living space. Then I used that percentage to determine the m2 for both store and living space. Am I doing this correctly?  
Let me give you my data:  
  
Price of building: 500000  
m2: 400  
m2 of living space: 300  
m2 of store: 100  
  
So:  
500000/400=1250 per m2  
(300/400)*100=75% of the whole m2  
(100/400)*100=25% of the whole m2  
  
75% of 1250 = 937.5  
25% of 1250 = 312.5  
  
So that’s a price of 937.5 per m2 for the living space and 312.5 per m2 correct?  
But why can’t I add these results to show the whole 500000 as result?  
937.5 * 300= 281250  
312.5 * 100= 31250  
281250+31250= 312500  
  
And why doesn’t the calculation work when I calculate the price of each store and living space first by parts of the whole price?  
  
Like:  
75% of 500000 is 375000 price of living  
25% of 500000 is 125000 price of store  
  
But:  
Price of each divided by their m2 (to determine the price per m2) gives me an unexpected result:  
375000/300=1250  
125000/100=1250  
  
Why does it seem that I have to now calculate 75% and 25% respectively from those 1250? I thought I already determined the 75% and 25% parts in the beginning?  
How can I determine the following things correctly:  
  
- The price per m2 of each of the parts of the building  
- The price of each of the parts of the building

In the spirit of, 'Oh, my goodness this brain fog is ridiculous/absurd/hilarious/startling,' here's my list from the last two days:

1. Forgot to charge my car. Didn't notice until I had taking the highway in the wrong direction for 20 minutes (away from home on a road I've driven 1000 times) and my car battery alarm started blaring. Made it to a charger and yes, turned around, but how'd that happen? \*facepalm #1 and #2
2. Went to meet a friend for coffee. Texted I'd be a few minutes late. When she didn't show, I suddenly realised that I had MADE IT UP out of thin air. The last time we were in touch was a week ago, when she said she'd get back me and organise a time. Guess I really wanted to see her! LOL \*facepalm #3
3. I wore two different shoes to the dentist. One black, one luminescent green. Not a pair. Oh, and yes, a sock on one foot because only one of the shoes needs socks. Makes sense. :-) Since much of the timeI can't see my feet when standing anymore (thanks, intermittent hormonal spare tire and breasts the size of watermelons!! :-)), I only noticed when the dental tech tipped up the chair. Luckily, she turned out to be one of our peri/meno sisters! She just glanced down, looked at me, nodded and said, 'Yep. That happened.' Which led to shared giggles and more stories. So affirming!! \*facepalm #4

On the upside, I've been learning a lot about these hormonal whackadoodle symptoms by using Oova to track. Turns out, at least for me...over-the-top estrogen spikes = total doofus. When my estrogen plummets, my clarity returns.

(I'm an astrophysics/linguistics nerd, so when the brain comes roaring back I can soothe the peri-onset hypochondria that it's not dementia by digging through a bunch of equations that are literally indecipherable to me during the estrogen spikes. A reminder to breathe. It's just the rollercoaster.)

Knowledge (and obstinate, persistent laughter in the face of the preposterous) are power!

Jacob McCowsky, US Citizen 

Date [Standardized Human Time]: January 6, 2137

“You have arrived,” the robotic voice on my GPS called out, stirring me from my sleep. 

*Fuck, I must have been more exhausted than I realized. I haven’t fallen asleep in the car in years.*

I stepped out into the cold winter air, stretching my aching limbs with a yawn. I hadn’t planned to head home this early, but I’d woken up to a troubling message from Telif in the middle of the night asking if I had any gauze. I assumed he wasn’t responding to my messages because it was about two in the morning and he wasn’t usually awake until closer to seven, but I was still worried about the big guy.

*Did someone try and hurt him while he was out with Sivik? You’d have to be an idiot to fuck with an Arxur, but Telif is such a cinnamon bun he might have let some dickhead push him around and they went too far. No no, he probably just broke a glass and cut his hand or something…*

I opened the front door, and my immediate fear that he would be lying dead in a pool of blood was assuaged by the lack of a murder scene in my living room. 

*See? He’s fine. Now just go poke your head in his room so you calm down and go back to sleep.* 

I crept my way up the stairs, trying my hardest not to make a sound as I rounded the corner and approached the door to the master bedroom. I placed my ear against the door, just in case Sivik had confessed his feelings and the two were doing something in there I couldn’t unsee. After confirming there was no sound of squeaking springs, I cracked the door open, letting the light from the hallway in just enough to let me see Telif safe and sound in his bed with Sivik wrapped in his arms.

*God you two are adorable, just ask each other out already.*

I turned to head for my room, immediately smashing my shin into the foyer table some dipshit had decided to put in my house and knocking Fernicus The Third to the ground with a loud crash.

“Fuck,” I grumbled as I clenched my bruised shin in my hands. “I just got that fuckin’ fern.” 

“Jacob?” The confused hiss came from behind me. “What are you doing here?”

“I live here,” I replied as I bent down to start scooping up the remains of my latest attempt to prove I could keep something alive. 

“I mean why are you here so early? I thought you were leaving your friends at noon?”

“I was, but then I woke up at midnight to take a piss and saw someone asking me where I kept my gauze and couldn’t get back to sleep.”

“Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make you worry about me.”

I stood up, realizing I needed a bag to actually put the remains of Fernicus in, and brushed the dirt off my hands, before wrapping my arms around Telif. 

“I’m just glad you’re okay, buddy. But why did you need it?”

“Oh yes, Sivik and I had a run in with a drunk man while out to dinner. He was upset about our presence and tried to hurt Sivik. Don’t worry though, the local law enforcement took him away.”

“Holy shit, is Sivik okay?” 

“Yeah, I’m fine.” The Venlil walked up behind Telif with a yawn. I immediately noticed his arm was wrapped in orange stained gauze. 

“Fuck, do you need to go to the hospital?” Panic was seeping into my voice as I pushed my way past Telif to get a closer look. “Who the fuck did this? We need to press charges. What the fuck?”

“Jacob, relax, I’m okay,” Sivik replied softly. “The police already took care of him, he tried to attack the officer who came to talk to us so they said he’s going away for awhile. We don’t need to do anything else.” 

“Why did he do this? Fuck I shouldn’t have left you two alone. This is all my fault. I’m so sorry.” My chest felt tight and my breathing was rapid. 

“Jacob, seriously it’s okay.” He grabbed my hand in his paw as he replied. “I promise.”

“No, it’s not okay. What if he’d had a gun? Oh god you could have been killed.” I could feel my cheeks getting wet. 

I felt a pair of strong arms wrap around me from behind. “Jacob please, it’s okay. We’re both fine.”

“No it’s not,” I sobbed. “Why would anyone do this?”

“He was just drunk and racist.” Sivik tried his best to hug me with one arm. “But we’re okay. It was just one asshole.”

*He still could have taken my new family from me.*

I felt myself calming down slightly as I pressed my face into Sivik’s soft fur. “I-I’m sorry. I-I don’t know what came over me. I-I think I’m just tired,” I lied. “I’m just glad you two are okay.”

“Do you want to sleep in here?” Sivik asked. “It might make you feel better. I know other Venlil find sharing a bed with friends to be comforting.”

“No, it’s fine. I don’t want to intrude.” 

“Come on, it’ll be fun,” Telif added. “Like when we slept by the fire!”

*That was more nerve wracking than fun…*

“Really, I’m fine guys.” I wiped the tears off my face.

“Well, if you’re going to be like this, you leave me no choice,” Telif said ominously. 

“What’s that me-” I let out a yelp as I felt my feet leave the ground. “What the hell are you doing?”

“You’re being stubborn, so I’m carrying you to bed,” the Arxur laughed as he began walking, while I squirmed in his grip.

“Put me down you bastard.” I found myself laughing against my will. 

“If you insist.” 

The fucker lifted me above the bed with ease before dropping me onto the mattress with a thud. Before I could scamper out, the tall lizard climbed in next to me, pushing me towards the center of the bed as Sivik climbed in on the other side. 

“Why am I in the middle?” I whined. “And come on at least let me clean up the mess I made in the hall and change out of my street clothes, I’m damp and covered in snow!” 

“Hmmmm, okay, but you’d better come back.” Telif crawled back out to let me escape.

“I will, I will,” I grumbled. “You two are absolutely ridiculous though.”

I wasn’t big on sharing a bed unless I had to, but I figured it would make the two of them happy. So I quickly ran downstairs to grab a trashbag for Fernicus’ final resting place, before heading to my room to throw on pajama pants. I spent ninety nine percent of my time in them now that I had a roommate and couldn’t sit around in my boxers. By the time I made it back to Telif’s room, the two had already passed back out.

*Fuck, I wish I could fall asleep that easily.* 

I contemplated just going back to my room to enjoy my comfy bed by myself, but I knew Telif would pout if I broke my promise. So I crawled in next to the big softy, gave him a quick hug, and closed my eyes.

~*~

“Alright boys, I’m gonna take a quick break from bodying you to get started on dinner, try not to miss me too much.”

“Fuck, wait Jacob, don’t make anything for me, I gotta head out,” Sivik called out before I could leave the living room.

“Aww man, you sure? I was gonna make onigiri for you and me and got some salmon for the big guy.”

“Yeah, I’m sure. Just got a text from my boss, they won’t tell me why but apparently I need to come in early tomorrow. From what he did say, it sounds like I’m in for a busy week,” he grumbled.

“Damn, that blows. Well, it was good seein’ ya dude.” I crouched down and gave the ball of fluff a hug.  “Let me walk you to your ca- wait, shit, I forgot you stole my garage. Fuck let me move my car.” I tossed on my coat and grabbed my keys that I had thrown haphazardly onto the coffee table. I let out a loud groan as I opened the door and saw that it had snowed more sometime after I got home, and that my driveway and car were covered in about fifteen centimeters of snow. “Ughhh fuck, looks like I’m gonna need to dig my car out and clear the driveway so you can escape.”

“I’ll help you out.” Sivik pulled my old hoodie over his head and I suppressed the urge to aww at him. “Thanks for joining me for dinner, Telif.” 

“Oh of course, sorry it ended like it did,” Telif replied with a hint of remorse in his voice.

The two embraced, causing a smile to stretch over my face. Siv and I made our way to my garage, grabbing two shovels off the wall and preparing to face the tedium. We’d barely stepped out the door when I heard the Venlil clear his throat behind me.

“Hey Jacob, can I talk to you about something?” 

“Of course dude, what’s up?” I tossed the first shovelful of snow to the side.

“It’s about something we talked about before.” He was avoiding looking at me as he spoke and his tail was twitching. “Please promise me you won’t tell Telif about this.”

“I kinda guessed you wanted to keep it from him since you waited till now to bring it up, but I promise.” I leaned on my shovel and looked at my friend. 

“So um, remember when you brought up therapy to me? I, uh, I think I’m ready to give it a try. Even if they send me to a facility…”

“First off, we don’t involuntarily commit people here unless they think you’re an immediate danger to yourself or others. Second, why the sudden change of heart?”

“I’m just, I’m so tired of being angry. Tired of feeling like I’m on the verge of breaking down every time I think of her. Tired of wishing I just won’t wake up in the morning.” I could see the tears starting to pour down his cheeks. I walked over and placed my hand on his shoulder. He’d brought up his condition to me after confiding in Telif, but I could swear, if he was capable of feeling it, then the Venlil was terrified of what I was about to say to him.

*There’s more going on here. You already knew he felt like this. Something else happened last night he’s not telling you.* 

“Siv, I’m so proud of you.” I wrapped him in a tight hug. “Admitting you need help is one of the hardest things you can do.”

“R-really?” he sniffled. “You are?”

“I am, but why didn’t you want Tel to know? You know better than anyone that he wants you to get better. That dude loves you to pieces.”

“Because I’m afraid if he knows the real me he won’t like it,” he whispered. 

“Dude, I don’t think that’s even slightly possible.” 

“You don’t know that. Neither of you know just how angry I am. How badly I’ve wanted to hurt the people who hurt me. Jacob, if Telif hadn’t intervened last night, I was going to kill that guy.”

*Holy shit. No no, keep calm you can’t let him think you hate him for this.*

“Siv, I’m so sorry you felt like you needed to hide this from me. You’ve been through so much.” I squeezed him tight. “You know you can tell me anything, right?”

“I’m in love with Telif.” I heard a faint whisper. 

*Oh my god, finally! Keep it together Jacob.*

“Have you told him yet?”

“No, and I’m not going to. Not until I’m someone he deserves. Someone who won’t hurt him.”

“You already are, but I understand what you mean. I promise you, I’m going to help you get better. My old therapist is back in Cambridge, but I’ll look into ones out here and find you someone good.”

“Thank you.” He squeezed me tight. “Um, but I do actually need to get home, so we should probably get back to work.”

“Oh right, forgot why we came out here.” 

~*~ 

With the two of us working together it only took about ten minutes to get Siv on his way, but I was freezing my ass off by the time I got back inside. Telif was sprawled out on the couch, watching his boring ass Lunar Detective show that he made me suffer through every Sunday night, even though he did nothing but complain about how bad the writing had become.

“Yo Tel, I need your body heat.” I ignored his protests as I climbed on top of the giant lizard, squishing myself between him and the couch. “Ahhh, so toasty.” 

“I thought you were going to make dinner,” he grumbled at me.

“I was, but now I’m feeling cold and lazy. How bout I just order us something?”

“Didn’t you say Friday that we do too much takeout?” he scolded. “What if I try making us something?”

“What, like on your own?” 

“Yeah, I’ve been helping you for over a week now, I think I’m ready.” 

“Alright if you insist.” I tried my best to hide the pride in my voice. “Shout if you need any help.”

~*~

“Dinners ready!” I heard the Arxur call out. I was excited to see what he tried to make for us. I thought I could smell beef from the living room while he was cooking, so maybe he grilled up the steaks I bought us? Either way I was excited to find out if I had a delicious meal or food poisoning waiting for me. 

“Smells good, whatcha make us?” 

“I found a recipe online for something called a “French Dip”. I am not sure if I can eat the onions without getting sick, so I made them separate for you, but I should be able to have a bit of bread and be fine. I hope you like it.”

“Oh damn, wasn’t expecting you to look up something new to make! I’m sure I’ll love it, bud.” 

Telif brought my plate out and set it down in front of me. The assembly reminded me a bit more of a greasy cheesesteak, but it smelled absolutely magnificent. The Arxur watched me with anticipation as I took the first bite. 

*Oh wow, this is better than I was expecting for his first try. Could use a bit more seasoning but otherwise he did a good job.*

“What do you think?”

“It’s really good! Where did you find the recipe?” 

“Oh I was just searching around for recipes that were mostly meat. You humans love to put vegetables in everything you cook so it took me a while, but I found this on some food website, and after reading a few paragraphs about how they discovered the recipe and how much it means to their family I decided to give it a try.”

*Huh, guess there is someone out there who reads the food blogger’s life story.*

“Well, good job finding it,” I praised him, earning a way of his tail. “I will say I think next time it could use a pinch more salt, and I personally enjoy a bit of horseradish on mine, but that’s more just my preference than anything.”

“You want me to make it again?” He tilted his head.

“Yeah dude, you’re a pretty good cook, I’ve taught you well.” I smiled. 

“Hmmm, maybe I could try cooking an herbivore meal for Sivik sometime. Do you think he would like that?”

*Wonder if Arxur also know the quickest way to a man’s heart is through his stomach?*

“I think he’d love it.”

Telif spent the rest of our dinner chittering away about his time with Sivik yesterday. I noticed he left out the part where he bought the new card packs that I saw the wrappers for in the trash. As we got closer to their dinner, I noticed he was starting to fidget a bit, and wondered if the encounter had shaken him more than he let on. It must have been hard on someone as caring as him to see his friend get hurt, and it sounded like Sivik himself was a bit rough with the man before Telif pulled him off. 

“So after Mal threw him out I was feeling a bit down and asked Sivik if we could just finish our food and head home. We were on our way back to the car when Sivik stumbled over the same man’s foot. He had apparently fallen asleep in the alley behind the bar, and started yelling at us about getting him kicked out. Sivik said something back to him, and before I knew what was happening, the asshole swung a bottle at Sivik’s head, but he was able to lift his arm in time to block it, which is how he ended up with the gash. And, um, after that I was so angry that I grabbed him by the throat and slammed him into the wall.”

*Wait wait, Telif was the one who fought back? I thought for sure it was Siv.*

“Fuck man, I’m so sorry you had to deal with that. I wish I coulda been there to keep you two safe... You said the cops came after?”

“Yes, Mal heard me shouting at him and came out with a gun thinking we were in trouble. He called the police for us, and, after reviewing the security footage, the guy was taken away.” 

“Damn, well, I’m glad Sivik had you there to keep him safe.” *Even if it sounds like Telif kept the drunk safe more than anything.* “Siv said you patched up his arm as well? Where did you learn to do that?”

“Oh, every Dominion soldier is taught how to treat their own wounds. I sutured every cut and bullet wound I received before I came to Earth.” He paused for a moment. “Actually, I’ve been wanting to bring this up to you but I wasn’t sure how to tell you. I, um, I want to leave construction and see if I can get a job in the medical field. I want to finally do something where I can help people instead of hurting them. Sivik said he thought I could be a good EMT or Nurse.” Telif looked down like he expected me to be upset at what he just told me for some reason. 

“I think that’s awesome, man,” I gave him a cheery reply. 

“You do?” He lifted his head.

“Yeah, why wouldn’t I?” 

“I, um, thought you would be sad that I didn’t want to work with you anymore.” 

“Pfft, you doofus, do you think I want to work this job forever either? If I wasn’t spending every day with my best friend I woulda dipped ages ago.”

“Really? So you’re not upset?”

“Of course not. In fact I’m stoked for you. Is there anything I can do to help?”

“Well, I’m not sure what the requirements would be, so I was thinking of giving Doctor Havashir a call.”

“That’s the guy who treated you when you got hurt, right?”

“Yeah, he still checks in on me from time to time, so I thought he might be open to helping me. I just, uh, wasn’t sure how to bring it up, since I was afraid he would tell me it’s a dumb idea…”

“Hmm, well it’s a bit late tonight, I don’t want to bug him while he’s having dinner or about to go to bed. Why don’t you send him a message and ask if he has any time this week to give you a call?”

“That sounds like a good idea. Thank you, Jacob.”

“Course man, how many times I gotta tell you and Siv you can talk to me about anything?” 

“In that case, there is actually one more thing I wanted to bring up.”

“Oh? What is it?”

“Can you promise not to tell Sivik?”

“Course man, anything you don’t want me to share stays between us.”

“I, um, I don’t know how to say this, but I’ve been feeling weird around Sivik lately. I’m not sure why, but when we’re together my heart beats faster and I feel nervous. It started around Christmas when he leaned on me after you went to bed. I know Arxur aren’t supposed to like physical contact, but it’s never bothered me when you hug me, so why does Sivik doing it feel different? Is it because he’s a Venlil? Maybe deep down I don’t think I deserve to be his friend after how many of his kind I’ve killed. I don’t know what to do.” 

His tail was starting to thrash behind him as I cut him off. “Woah, slow down Tel, you’re goin a mile a minute. Take a deep breath.” The Arxur imitated my nod and did as I instructed. “There, better?”

“Yeah, thanks. But why am I feeling this way?”

*Hmm, how do I explain this to him? From everything he’s told me, Arxur don’t really do dating or feelings. Wait, maybe I can relate it to that dumb show he loves.*

“You know that st-show you love with the annoyingly long episodes? Remember how at the start Detective Benoit and that lady in forensics were just friends, but as the show progressed they started to get closer until Benoit told her that he loves her?”

*Fuck me why do I know so much about this show.*

“Yes?”

“You like Sivik the same way.”

“But we’re both male? And different species?”

“Yeah dude, you are.”

“I don’t understand, why would I want to mate with Sivik if we can’t reproduce?”

“Oh god, I thought you already had this talk with Sam?”

“Yes, she said that sometimes two humans of the same gender can pair off, but that’s still two humans. Do people do that with other species as well?”

*What has my life become when I am about to explain the birds and the bees, or I guess the bees and the bees, to an alien?*

“Relationships aren’t just about having kids, dude. Like a lot of humans choose not to have any kids, but that doesn’t mean they love each other any less.”

“But I was always told the only reason two people should mate is to continue a worthy bloodline.” 

“That’s just because the Dominion wanted you not to have any feelings and be a mindless killer. Relationships are about more than just sex, dude. One of my best friends in high school was asexual, so he never did anything like that in any of his relationships, and he’s been happily married to a girl, who feels the same way, for a few years now.”

“A-sexual?” He repeated with a tilt of his head. “What’s that?”

“People who don’t feel any sexual attraction. Like, um, do you only want to uh, mate, with Arxur women because you feel obligated to?”

“No, I liked it as well.”

*Wait, liked? Nevermind moving on I don’t wanna know.*

“Um, well in that case do you want to mate with, I dunno, Beth?”

“Prophet no, no offense but you humans look strange.”

“Hurtful. Anyway, imagine you looked at all other Arxur, men and women alike, and felt the same way. That’s kind of like being asexual.”

“I think I understand, so you’re saying I can feel that way about Sivik even though we are both male and different species?”

*YES YOU DENSE LIZARD OH MY GOD.*

“Yeah man,” I replied calmly.

“Do you think I should tell him?”

*Fuck if you had asked me this morning I woulda said yes, but after my talk with Siv…*

 “Hmm, that’s a tough question. I genuinely think he might feel the same way, but I am not sure he is in the best place mentally right now, and I think more than a partner, right now he just needs friends.”

“Oh that’s true.” He didn’t sound upset at least. “Thank you, Jacob. I’m going to do my best to be a good friend to Sivik.”

“I know you will, buddy. Anyway you wanna watch a movie before we go to bed? I’ve been wanting to check out this new eldritch horror film that just came out.”

“What is eldritch horror?” He tilted his head the same way he always does. 

“Ah of course you don’t know what that is. Ummm, things beyond your comprehension that drive you insane. Old gods that cause madness, stuff like that.”

“I don’t get it.”

“I’m bad at explaining things, let’s just check it out and see if you like it.”

“Alright, if you think I’ll like it.”

“You might.” I laughed as the two of us walked to the living room. Luckily I had been planning to watch this for a few days now, so I had already sailed the seven seas and downloaded it to my laptop. I plugged it into my TV, hopped up on the couch next to my best friend, and hit play. 

*Tel, I love you, but please do not make me have this kind of talk ever again.*

Well, this morning at the park NK4 asks me in front of ALL THE OTHER KIDS AND THEIR NANNIES/PARENTS “is that wine in there? Are you drinking the wine we got you?” while pointing at my coffee cup. 

“No, goofy, this is coffee!” 
“But you drink wine right? You drink it lots of times?” 

Kid please stop making me look like a lush you learned what wine was like yesterday 😭😭😭

1gqjefb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TBI/comments/1gqjefb/tbi_tips_tricks/,TBI Tips & Tricks,"I recently shared this list in a comment on someone else’s post but figured it might benefit more people this way..

This is my list of ever-evolving TBI life hacks that I started a few years ago. Please feel free to share any other tips or resources you’ve found on your own journey.

Share the Love: TBI Tips and Tricks

•	⁠Cold showers for improved circulation and inflammation reduction (I typically start with a hot shower and just slowly move it colder throughout until it’s completely cold by the end)


•	⁠Brain injury alliance (US organization with tons of small local chapters and resources)


•	⁠Adaptive sports (look up ‘adaptive sports near me’ for local groups of other active, handicapable people trying to get out)


•	⁠Hope Survives podcast (TBI focused podcast covering a wide range of topics, available wherever you listen)


•	⁠LoveYourBrain (TBI virtual support groups & free US retreats)


•	⁠Brain food. Adjust your diet to incorporate naturally beneficial foods like anti inflammatory items such as certain berries, Mediterranean diet foods, coffee, nuts, etc.


•	⁠Vocational rehabilitation services (Available in local and state chapters. Services provided can include resume help, job finding services, etc)


•	⁠Brain injury ID card. (Brainlaw.com - can take about 8 weeks to receive)


•	⁠Practice mindfulness by doing yoga. Yoga Nidra is super accessible to all ability levels. Stay as present as possible. No living in the past.


•	⁠Preboard for flights (I have only ever tested Delta, American Airlines, and Southwest, but evidently most airlines will allow you to preboard for a flight if you have a TBI. I always go to the flight desk upon arriving to the gate and ask directly. “Hello, I have a traumatic brain injury. Can I please preboard the flight?” I have never been denied.

•	⁠Academic accommodations (if you are interested in returning to school following a TBI, reach out to your school’s Student Disability Services. You have a legitimate disability. You can still learn, but learning may look a little different now. SDS can get you the accommodations you need to be successful in your classes. This might look like the professor providing you with notes, more time to complete exams or projects, a private, quiet testing space away from the distracting large classroom environment with other test takers fidgeting, rustling papers, clicking their pens, or clearing their throats.)


•	⁠Love to read but can’t remember anything you just read when you get to the end of a paragraph?! SAME. Welcome to the world of Audiobooks. Audible is a great audiobook app but can get expensive if you consume a lot. Overdrive & Libby apps are both library based apps that allow you to ‘check out’ tablet and audiobooks for free. Spotify also offers plans that include audiobooks for certain memberships.


•	⁠Self care apps: Ten percent happier meditation, sanvello, insight timer, Balance (all come with in-app purchases)


•	⁠Adaptive pass for skiing (cheaper. If you are still an active skier and/or snowboarder, research your mountain or ski pass of choice’s ADAPTIVE pass. This is especially true for major ski passes like ICON or EPIC. They have significantly more affordable season passes available for those of us who are a little damaged but still want to do it again! You can thank me later.)


•	⁠Adaptive US America The Beautiful LIFETIME National Parks Pass (you read that right. You can get a lifetime pass to America’s National AND State Parks just for hitting your head! AMAZING! I have one. This is not a drill. It’s kind of annoying because you have to actually submit documentation stating you have a permanent disability, but that’s it. I now have a Lifetime Pass. Highly recommend.)


•     Make the LISTS, REMINDERS, CALENDAR, and ALARM apps on your phone your new favorites. Maybe even group them together as ‘essentials.’ Whatever. Just make sure you have easy, quick access to these super simple tools that 99% of us already have right at our fingertips. Can’t remember to water your plants that used to be your babies?! Set a weekly reminder. Can’t keep track of birthdays, anniversaries, or your appointments that used to be burned on the inside of your skull.. or do you regularly show up at the wrong time or place or in the wrong day? Prioritize putting EVERYTHING, even the little things like “call granny”, on your calendar with alerts set to announce events ahead of time and when it’s time to actually leave for that event.


•     Do yourself a favor and MAKE LISTS. What you are reading right now is literally a list from my phone that was copied and pasted in to this post because I have a TBI, needed to remember all of these simple little life changes to make my existence not so freaking hard, and thus, I wrote everything down and constantly add to it so I have a guide to reference, OR SHARE (you’re welcome).
