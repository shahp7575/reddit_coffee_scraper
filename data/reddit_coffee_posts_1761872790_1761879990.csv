1okjoud,https://www.reddit.com/r/IVF/comments/1okjoud/starting_to_feel_pretty_empty/,Starting to feel pretty empty.,"We just lost our 5AA embryo after a pretty brutal journey. We did our first transfer 10/16, a day before my 36th birthday and we're doing IVF for unexplained MFI. We had been trying naturally for a few years only to find out we probably won't be able to conceive without IVF due to low counts, morphology issues, and high DNA frag. My husband and I are pretty healthy individuals, never smokers and have a drink maybe 3 times a year, overall healthy eating. We did two egg retrievals - 1st one: 18 eggs, 14 mature, all 14 fertilized, 9 blasts, and 2 euploids (same gender and we don't know the gender). Without hesitation, I opted in for a second egg retrieval due to our family plans and for having a few in the bank in case things don't work out. My MD did not include zymot the first round because he stated he doesn't like to throw everything in all at once. He also opted in for a ""gentle stim"" for the second ER. This is why I am so sad and angry. I had 24 follicles but the MD didn't want to overcrowd the ovaries and focused on quality vs quantity. We ended up with 6 eggs resulting in 1 euploid (I think 4AB). We sat down and asked why we didn't just repeat the first protocol to have numbers on our side. Our MD actually apologized, stated ""you're right, we should have gone for the numbers"", and that he regrets not reviewing our first cycle and thinking about it some more. We then restested a chaotic from the first ER which actually came back as a euploid. 

All of my euploids are the same gender. I don't want to know what they are but it truly breaks my heart to know that I may not have a daughter or a son. Most of my anger and sadness stems from not retrieving all of my eggs during the second ER and I will always wonder what if? I have the eggs now but I may not have them in the near future, so why wouldn't we just get them while we can? Our MD wanted to do a transfer after all this but I pushed for an EMB even though I don't have any endo symptoms. My receptiva came back positive at 1.8 and he wanted to transfer irregardless but we advocated for 2 months lupron supression (I even called the receptiva folks for some insight). And now here I am. All that we've been through and it still didn't stick. Part of me wonders what it would be like if we didn't switch doctors but who knows. I'm just going through it, questioning everything along the way. I did have a drink, some coffee, and I plan on having an italian sub this week to cheer myself up. I'm just overwhelmingly sad and I'm trying my best to stay positive. ",1,1761879719.0,IVF,0,1.0,False

1okjoe0,https://www.reddit.com/r/lipedema/comments/1okjoe0/whats_been_working_stage_15_probably/,"What's been working (stage 1.5, probably)","Hello! I (40F) I came to this board at the beginning of this year because my legs were extremely heavy and swollen, bruised and agonizingly painful, and doctors did not understand what I was telling them. Through googling things like ""leg fat hurts"" I found out about this disorder and made my way to this board. 

Been trying different things and grappling with it over the course of this year. I was so completely hopeless, lost, and honestly terrified when I first came to this board. Thank you all for your contributions. I am so glad we can help each other where doctors fail. This board seriously saved my life, I was completely out of my mind with pain.

So, this post turned out to be really long, but I wanted to report on some things I've tried and how it all went for me:

Keto diet (classic keto, 80% fat) - This is the first piece of advice I got here and I started immediately. It was like a miracle. Keto me from retaining water and took my lipedema pain down to basically zero within the first week (likely the ""whoosh"" of losing all your water weight). Also reduced my allergies and inflammation all over.  I am eating whole foods (including cheeses), except for Rebel ice cream... Yummm

Alcohol - when I started keto at the beginning of this year, I was sober, but then I started having wine again, and then I started having wine everyday, and it was really impacting my life. Stopped drinking October 1 and i am looking and feeling MUCH better. Maybe a 'duh' discovery but I had to report it!

Self lymph massage - as learned from the Cancer Rehab PT YouTube. Very beneficial and painless. Subtle, gentle, but really helps the fluid move up to pee out. I am not currently doing this regularly, as my legs feel fine right now, but do it as needed.

Butchers Broom - Excellent for me. Indispensable. Takes the extra fluid out of my legs. I'm not taking it everyday anymore, more like once or twice a week if my legs are doing poorly (if I eat too much salt or something).

DIM + CDG - I think this has been a definite game changer for me in a number of ways. Peri symptoms were really bad. Suddenly I was having hot flashes and crying all the time. I tried HRT and did not like how it made me feel. After watching this video where she describes her self-experimentation and losing 30 lb (https://youtu.be/Ni5kcSq0Jw4) it really seemed to me like I had too much estrogen or a problem processing estrogen, so I started taking this once a day. I haven't had any of the perimenopause symptoms again, and my legs are looking REALLY good. I also had a blood draw that showed extremely high estrogen but normal levels of the other hormones, and while I know hormones are constantly fluctuating, this test was really really high, and the symptoms matched my experience. I did have some intense hair shedding at first but that has totally stopped. Makes urine look a
orangish at first.

Compression socks - Love the knee-high wool blend Sockwell socks, they give me energy! Didn't really feel the benefit from the thigh-high thick nylons I got from Amazon. Also got a rash from the silicone dots at the top. Currently not using any compression because the swelling is under control from diet/supplements/weather

Salt intake - I was told by doctors for years I need to add salt to my food to help with my POTS and low blood pressure, especially since I'm on keto now. I found that once I *stopped* doing that, my fluid balance in my body became much more manageable. So, no extra salt or electrolytes for me, thanks!

Hydration - I have stopped trying to drink 2L of pure water a day, and I'm just drinking when I'm thirsty. I'm still getting about 2L of water through veggies, coffee, tea, and drinking water. Drinking so much water was messing up my electrolytes and (I think) causing me to swell.

Vibration plate - it's great! One of the first things I tried. I take a wide stance, to get a strong shake. Really shook up my lymphatic system and activated all my little muscles. Makes me itch, but that's normal. Haven't been using it much lately because...

Exercise - Since things have been going so well I thought I would look into learning to run instead of just walk around all day. I watched some YouTubes about running warm-up drills where you run in place, lifting your knees up in front of you and making sure to get a lot of ankle movement. I have found that doing this for even 60 seconds a day, at a very fast pace, pumps the swelling out of my lower legs in a way that walking never has. It's the same effect for me as the vibration plate, except a bit stronger, probably because of the ankle pumping really flexing the calf muscles instead of just vibrating everything. This is the most recent approach I've added and I love how it's just 60 seconds out of my day. The smallest HIIT workout ever?

Sauna - No effect really, but nice to be warm. Sometimes it feels quite gross because the relaxation makes my skin/lipedema go all flabby. Not painful, though.

Weightlifting - Awesome! I do a basic dumbbell workout at home 2-3x a week I got from YouTube. I have more muscle than ever in my life but I don't look buff or anything. Easier to do life tasks. Was inspired by A Physical Education by Casey Johnston, as well as this board and wondering what I can do to take control over my body's growth.

Cooler weather - yes please! I think we all agree there :)

...That's all I can remember right now! I know it's not as exciting without photographs, but if you've been considering any of these approaches I hope that reading my experience helps you. The change in my leg texture is similar to the posts we see recently with GLP1 success: legs look smooth instead of bumpy. My pain is virtually gone. I still have bruises all over the legs and tricep area. My weight is the same, but I believe my body fat percentage is going down, and my legs are definitely slimmer.",1,1761879681.0,lipedema,0,1.0,False

She did genuinely care for me a lot and loved me whole heartedly, which I did as well.

Some warning signs from the beginning. She dated very successful rich guys, think hedge fund managers and even wealthier. I told her I do okay for myself but not to that extent. She said she doesn’t care she just wants someone that cares about her

We both make around 300-500k each range as a ballpark. She lived her whole life in another country where the cultural norm is that the guy pays for everything. Also given she dated rich guys I’m sure they paid for everything.

She has expensive taste in food, clothing; and in the us things are usually split a bit more. I said I’m glad to cover more than half maybe 70% or so.

Every meal is at least 150 or more, and it’s more like I have to cover everything whether it’s expensive or a cup of coffee. It’s not about the money but just very basic respect. It’s not uncommon for me to spend 300 or more before she gets one thing that is like a lunch or a dinner. Again, she does well for herself and also makes a lot in income.

She also loves to travel where I don’t need to travel as much. We travel 3 times this year, because she asked for it and not me. I’m expected to pay for all of the hotels, pretty much all of the meals, maybe 80-90% of the trip.

We go on a long weekend trip which I drive 12 hours, she booked the hotel. After the trip she asks me to send her money for the hotel. I ended up paying for the whole trip cause I didn’t care at that point. She also wanted to go to an expensive sports event which I ended up paying for and doing for her, just to make her happy. She then said she felt rejected because we didn’t go to her favorite clothing store there because I said it was late and we did a lot that long weekend. I said how do you not see everything I did for us, taking us on a trip at your request, doing everything you want but you’re going to make a big deal over not going to one store. 

The big thing is that I feel that she always looks at what she does not have or get and doesn’t appreciate the things I do for her.

She tells me she always has so many people chasing her, which was not genuine and made me feel like she wanted to tell me how desirable she is which upset me a lot.

She also said she is very aggressive, and said it’s very normal for her to curse at her partners when they fight. I never curse at anyone I’ve dated because that’s not me and I wouldn’t do that to someone I respect and love. She would scream and curse at me extremely loudly. I am rarely ever like that but when I get attacked like that I also react similarly. 

We have a lot of care for each other but I’m wondering if I have the right to feel resentful

I realize I am only saying the bad parts, but there was a lot if not more great things about us

I will admit I had my fair share of mistakes. She says I wasn’t there for her when she needed me, which is true in a few cases. But I sincerely apologized and I think I was there for her and showed so much care way more often than 
not.

my brother & his fiancée lived with my parents for about 5 years & in that time they witnessed the weird dynamic they have as a couple. they have always felt that she takes more than she gives. my brother is at her beck & call, always, & it doesn’t seem to be reciprocated whatsoever. he always plans extravagant getaways for her birthday, valentines, everything she wants he buys & she has NEVER planned a dang thing for him on his birthday. he wears himself thin working his full time job & doordash just to be able to buy her the things she wants. he comes home after a long day of working and proceeds to do laundry and cook for her when she’s been cooped up in their room all day (she never came out of the room unless he was home which is strange because my parents are the nicest people in the world). mind you we’ve never once seen her do anything for herself let alone him aside from getting her nails and lashes done. i’m not saying the woman is the one who should be doing all the cooking & cleaning but it just seems she doesn’t care for my brother in the same way he does her considering he’s exhausted from working two jobs for over 14 hours a day. i’m also 99% sure he’s maxed out all of his credit cards buying her things because she’s a very materialistic person (hence why he started working doordash to pay off his debt but is now caught playing a never-ending game of catchup). but this isn’t even the tip of the iceberg.

everyone in my family has noticed while having dinner or having family time, (which they rarely partake in because they’re always busy with her family) when she gets up and goes to the restroom, my brother will text her what we’re talking about or what’s going on while she’s away.. which, in my opinion, seems like a little much. i’ve tried inviting him to coffee & such just to see how he’s doing & he ALWAYS has to bring her around. when i ask for it to be a brother/sister date he stops replying. it’s almost like he can’t hangout with his own family if she’s not present which is so freaking weird to me. i’ve also seen him secretly call her while he’s having 1 on 1 conversations with us as a family with her on the like listening to what we’re saying. i mean there’s just been a lot that has happened in the 10 years they’ve been together that it’d be too exhausting to think about and type out. we’ve tried calmly talking to him about it in the past & he goes bat shit crazy for even speaking her name wrongfully. it seems like a one-sided relationship & it breaks my heart because my brother is so sweet & deserves the world at his feet but he seems to be completely blinded by it all. am i crazy? is he dating a manipulative narcissist?

In that finale, 17-year-old Cameron Cope had just convinced his mother, Barbara, to let him stay in the Corps despite being underage[people.com](https://people.com/boots-show-ending-explained-netflix-11829288#:~:text=Crucible). Sergeant Sullivan – Cameron’s tough drill instructor with whom he shared an unspoken bond – went AWOL to save a missing recruit during the final exercise and then disappeared into the night after telling Cameron, “You’re ready… You’re a Marine now”[people.com](https://people.com/boots-show-ending-explained-netflix-11829288#:~:text=When%20Jones%20goes%20missing%2C%20Fajardo,goes%20AWOL%20to%20locate%20Jones). Sullivan’s fate was left uncertain; he’d been struggling with personal demons (including a near-fatal bar fight) and under investigation because of his sexuality, putting his future in jeopardy[people.com](https://people.com/boots-show-ending-explained-netflix-11829288#:~:text=Earlier%20in%20the%20season%2C%20Sullivan,decides%20to%20disregard%20his%20duties). Season 2 picks up at this pivotal moment, launching the characters from the training grounds into the reality of war. Set in late 1990 and early 1991 – a time when being gay in the military was still strictly forbidden[people.com](https://people.com/boots-show-ending-explained-netflix-11829288#:~:text=,to%20go%20to%20this%20conflict) – the season will blend high-stakes combat drama with deep emotional currents. The storyline delves into love and loyalty under fire, as Cameron and his comrades head to the Gulf War, their relationships tested by distance and danger. Below is a comprehensive episode-by-episode storyline for Season 2, packed with intense battles, heartfelt moments, and the enduring hope of love amid chaos.

# Episode 1 – “Call to Arms”

**Synopsis:** The season opener begins mere hours after the Season 1 finale. Cameron and his fellow graduates are still in their dress uniforms at the Marine Corps base bar when President George H. W. Bush’s address on TV sinks in: U.S. forces will deploy in response to Saddam Hussein’s aggression[people.com](https://people.com/boots-show-ending-explained-netflix-11829288#:~:text=President%20Bush%20then%20announces%20the,be%20involved%20in%20the%20war). The jubilant mood evaporates as reality sets in – boot camp is over, and a real war lies ahead.

* **Deployment Orders:** At dawn, Cameron’s unit receives official orders to join Operation Desert Shield. The young Marines scramble to prepare, adrenaline and anxiety high. Cameron, Ray McAffey (his best friend), and the rest of their platoon are told they’ll ship out to Saudi Arabia within days to help defend against further Iraqi advance into the Arabian Peninsula[history.com](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/august-7/bush-orders-operation-desert-shield#:~:text=On%20August%207%2C%201990%2C%20President,resources%20in%20the%20%2065). There’s an urgent, almost chaotic energy as they pack gear and say hurried goodbyes. Cameron’s heart pounds with a mix of excitement and dread – this is what he signed up for, but he never imagined it would happen so soon.
* **Barbara’s Return:** Barbara Cope, having stayed overnight near the base after graduation, rushes to see her son one last time before deployment. In an emotional reunion, she fusses over Cameron’s packing, trying to slip extra socks and his favorite cookies into his duffel. She can’t hide her worry. “You’re so young,” she whispers, tears in her eyes, remembering that he’s only 17. Cameron reassures her with a bravado he doesn’t truly feel, saying he’s trained for this and will make her proud. Their bond, tested in Season 1 by his enlistment, now deepens. Barbara promises to write every day and presses a St. Christopher medal into his hand for protection. The scene is heartfelt, showing the **mother-son dynamic** that will play out through letters and memories over the season.
* **Uncertain Fate of Sullivan:** Through hushed conversations, Cameron learns that Sgt. Liam Sullivan has been *relieved of duty* pending disciplinary action. Rumors swirl on base that Sullivan’s unauthorized absence during the Crucible (to rescue the lost recruit) and his earlier bar fight have landed him in the brig (military jail) or worse. Cameron is haunted by their last exchange and the unresolved tension between them. He asks Captain Fajardo about Sullivan’s whereabouts, but she pointedly tells him it’s “out of your hands, Marine.” This leaves Cameron worried – and more determined than ever to live up to the faith Sullivan showed by handing over that radio. **Foreshadowing:** As Cameron boards the transport plane, he glances back, hoping to spot Sullivan one last time on the tarmac. He doesn’t see him… but the camera lingers on a distant figure in dress uniform watching the departing planes. The stage is set: we suspect Sullivan will return, but the when and how remain a mystery.
* **Departure and Reflection:** The episode ends with a montage: Cameron’s plane lifting off as he and dozens of young Marines stare out at the receding California coast. For many, it’s their first time leaving home – now bound for a desert half a world away. Over this montage, Cameron’s voiceover reads the start of a letter he writes to his mom mid-flight. In it, he admits his fear but also his resolve: “**I don’t know what awaits us in Kuwait, but I know why I’m here**,” he writes, alluding both to serving his country and proving himself. In the final shot, Barbara sits at home in Ohio, clutching a family photo and praying as the news repeats footage of troops deploying. The war – and their family’s part in it – has truly begun.

# Episode 2 – “Desert Shield”

**Synopsis:** Cameron and his unit arrive in Saudi Arabia as part of Operation Desert Shield, joining thousands of coalition troops massing in the desert. This episode immerses us in the stark new environment and reintroduces a familiar face under unexpected circumstances.

* **Sand and Shock:** Stepping off the C-130 cargo plane, Cameron is hit by a blast of hot, dry air. The vast Saudi desert stretches out before the young Marines – tan tents, camouflaged tanks, and endless dunes under a searing sun. It’s a far cry from Parris Island. The friends stick together: Ray cracks a joke about the heat (“I think I’m literally frying in my boots!”), and Joshua “Jonesy” Jones – the sleepwalker recruit they saved during the Crucible – gawks at a **camel** wandering near the airstrip, providing a moment of comic relief. The show takes a brief upbeat tone as the guys attempt to adapt (with some fish-out-of-water humor, like struggling to eat local rations or trading MRE items), highlighting the camaraderie that keeps them sane.
* **Reunited with Sullivan:** On base at Dhahran, Cameron is stunned to encounter **Sgt. Sullivan** once again. In a gripping reveal, Sullivan strides into the Marines’ desert camp as part of a newly arrived contingent of NCOs. It turns out the Marine Corps, facing a potential shooting war, has temporarily reinstated certain disciplined personnel for their combat expertise. Sullivan, a highly decorated Recon Marine, has been given a second chance – he’s assigned to a combat unit in the same region. The moment Cameron sees Sullivan in the chow tent, carrying a tray and looking haunted yet determined, time seems to stop. Cameron’s heart leaps; relief and confusion wash over him. Sullivan notices him too, but strict military bearing keeps their interactions formal in public. Still, a brief exchange of pleasantries while waiting for coffee conveys volumes through subtext. **(Love Dynamic Spark)**: Their eyes meet a second longer than normal; both remember the intimacy of that moonlit forest where Sullivan bared a sliver of his soul to Cameron. Cameron manages a quiet, “Good to see you, *Sir*,” and Sullivan nods, replying, “Good to see you *too*, Marine.” For both men, this deployment suddenly holds new meaning.
* **New Command and Tensions:** The platoon joins **Bravo Company, 1st Battalion** of a Marine Regiment stationed at the front. They meet their company commander, Captain Avery, and platoon leader, Lt. Diaz – tough but earnest officers preparing these green Marines for what may come. Training resumes in the desert: long marches in sand, live-fire exercises, chemical attack drills donning gas masks (a necessary precaution as Saddam Hussein has threatened chemical weapons[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/the-gulf-war-idJPRTXAOZG/#:~:text=,p)). Some of the grizzled veterans tease the “boot” Marines, but our core group starts proving themselves. Cameron struggles to fire his rifle accurately in the windy dunes, and one hard-nosed sergeant (not Sullivan) barks at him. Surprisingly, Sullivan steps in with measured advice rather than insults, coaching Cameron on stabilizing his aim in the sand. The veterans watch this interaction with raised eyebrows – why is Sullivan taking special care with this particular Private? Sullivan brusquely assigns Cameron extra target practice at dusk, but when it’s just the two of them, his tone softens: “I’m making sure you’re ready, Cope. War’s coming fast.” Cameron nods, the memory of Sullivan’s past mentorship making him ache to ask more, but they remain professional. Still, the trust rebuilding between them is evident.
* **Letters Home (Homefront I):** Mid-episode, we cut to Barbara back home. She writes her first letter to Cameron at the kitchen table. Through her voiceover, we feel her worry and her effort to stay upbeat for her son. She recounts mundane news – the family dog’s antics, the changing fall leaves – anything to give him a slice of home. But when she pauses, gazing at the **blue star** service flag she’s hung in the window (signifying a child at war), we see her facade falter. In a quiet moment, Barbara attends a support meeting for military families in town. Other parents share updates from their deployed loved ones. One mother mentions her son is “somewhere in Saudi Arabia” and describes the stress of waiting for any news. Barbara, normally private, opens up about Cameron for the first time: “He’s only 17… always wanted to prove himself.” Another parent squeezes her hand. This subplot shows the **solidarity of those left behind**, as Barbara finds strength in community while fearing for her only child.
* **Ending – Storm on the Horizon:** The episode concludes with a scene at night in the Saudi camp. Cameron sits under the stars scribbling a reply to his mom, when Sullivan approaches. In the darkness, away from prying eyes, Sullivan permits a more personal conversation. Cameron thanks Sullivan for helping train him and blurts out, “I’m glad you’re here… Sir.” It’s more than just gratitude – it’s an emotional truth. Sullivan, momentarily dropping his steely guard, admits quietly, “Me too.” He warns Cameron that things will get harder from here: intelligence reports indicate Iraq might dig in and the standoff could turn violent soon if diplomacy fails. They mention President Bush’s ultimatum for Iraq to withdraw by January 15, 1991, or face force[people.com](https://people.com/boots-show-ending-explained-netflix-11829288#:~:text=In%20real%20life%2C%20President%20Bush,Iraqi%20forces%20didn%27t%20leave%20Kuwait) – a date now only weeks away. Sullivan’s voice wavers almost imperceptibly as he says, “Just…keep your head down out there, Cope.” It’s as close to openly caring as he can get. Cameron promises to watch out, and tentatively adds, “You too, Liam,” using Sullivan’s first name for the first time. Sullivan doesn’t reprimand him for the breach of protocol – instead, he offers a faint smile before departing into the shadows. The camera lingers on Cameron’s face, which is equal parts fear and hope as he realizes how much he cares about Sullivan’s safety. War is looming, and their connection – however undefined – will be tested like never before.

# Episode 3 – “Brothers in the Sand”

**Synopsis:** As 1990 turns to 1991, the Marines settle into a tense routine in the Saudi desert, forging bonds and facing the mental strain of waiting for a war to start. This episode focuses on camaraderie and the emotional toll of living in limbo, interwoven with moments that further deepen Sullivan and Cameron’s relationship against the backdrop of secrecy.

* **Band of Brothers:** The platoon’s daily life at the front is a mix of grinding preparation and boredom. We see the guys fortify defensive positions, dig foxholes, and run drills, but also play cards by flashlight and celebrate New Year’s Eve 1991 with non-alcoholic near-beer and sardonic toasts (“Happy New Year in the middle of nowhere!” quips Ray). During downtime, character backstories emerge: Ray confides in Cameron that he’s determined to prove himself to his father – a Vietnam vet – by earning commendations in this conflict. Jonesy, the formerly sleepwalking recruit, lightens the mood by reading aloud a funny letter from his little sister, making everyone laugh about a mis-transcribed address that had his mail sent to “Saudi *Indiana*” by mistake. These lighthearted moments serve to humanize the Marines, showing their youth and the strong **friendships** developing under duress.
* **Sullivan’s Burden:** Sullivan, though still officially with another unit, frequently interacts with Cameron’s platoon – ostensibly to help train or share intel. But we get private glimpses of Sullivan alone that reveal his inner turmoil. In one scene, Sullivan sits on his cot late at night, looking at a worn photograph of a man tucked in his notebook. This subtle hint – that Sullivan had (or has) someone he loved – ties back to Season 1’s implications about his sexuality[people.com](https://people.com/boots-show-ending-explained-netflix-11829288#:~:text=The%20actor%20continued%2C%20,things%20and%20for%20being%20gay). He quickly hides the photo when another sergeant passes by. It’s clear Sullivan lives in fear of exposure even here, and the war’s uncertainty only amplifies his desire to set things right in his life. Later, Captain Avery reminds Sullivan that once this conflict is over, his pending investigation will resume – war is only a temporary reprieve for him. Sullivan nods stiffly, understanding that heroics on the battlefield might be his only shot at redeeming his career or at least leaving with honor.
* **A Confidante for Cameron:** One quiet evening, Cameron and Ray share guard duty under a starry sky. In a heartfelt conversation, Cameron finally confesses that he’s been struggling with something personal. He doesn’t outright say he’s gay, but he dances around it: “Ray, have you ever felt…different, and afraid people wouldn’t accept you if they knew?” Ray, perceptive and loyal, replies gently, “You know I got your back no matter what, right?” He mentions that in boot camp he noticed Sullivan seemed to single Cameron out, but not out of malice – perhaps out of protectiveness. Ray suspects the truth about Cameron (and maybe Sullivan, though he doesn’t vocalize it), and in this moment affirms their friendship: “Whatever *it* is, you’re not alone.” Cameron is visibly relieved, emotion in his eyes, and he simply says “Thank you.” It’s a touching scene of acceptance. **(Love Dynamic)**: This also pushes Cameron closer to acknowledging his feelings about Sullivan. Ray’s friendship gives him courage; he even drafts an unsent letter to Sullivan in his journal that night – pouring out gratitude and longing in words he could never speak aloud. Though he never intends to show it, writing the letter is cathartic and foreshadows a deeper confession down the line.
* **Homefront II – Fears and Faith:** Back in Ohio, Barbara’s storyline progresses. She’s now receiving Cameron’s letters, which are cautiously optimistic and full of generic reassurances (“I’m safe and with my buddies, don’t worry”). Barbara reads these at the dinner table, visibly comforted just to have his words. Yet, a scare comes when a televised news report shows footage of a **Scud missile attack** near Dhahran where U.S. troops are based. Barbara’s heart stops – that’s where Cameron mentioned he was! In reality, the report might be referencing incidents like the missile strikes Iraq launched in January[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/the-gulf-war-idJPRTXAOZG/#:~:text=Image%3A%20,HeadLine)[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/the-gulf-war-idJPRTXAOZG/#:~:text=ATTACK%20ON%20BAGHDAD%20IN%20THE,HeadLine). Barbara frantically calls the Marine Corps information line for families and is told there’s no news of casualties in her son’s unit. This sequence portrays the rollercoaster of fear military families endure. That Sunday in church, Barbara lights a candle for Cameron’s safety. Vera Farmiga’s portrayal would shine here, as Barbara steels herself with quiet prayers and a resolve to stay strong for her son. **Symbolism:** She begins assembling a care package – including a photo of the family and homemade cookies – tangible love sent across the miles.
* **Clandestine Connection:** Near episode’s end, Sullivan secretly approaches Cameron with a risky proposition: he has a short-wave radio receiver and invites Cameron (and Ray, as cover) to listen to BBC news with him, away from the camp hustle. In a hidden corner behind supply crates, the three huddle quietly as static-laced broadcasts detail diplomatic talks failing and the UN deadline for Iraq’s withdrawal nearing. After Ray leaves, thanking Sullivan, an unspoken moment passes between Cameron and Sullivan. Cameron softly says, “Whatever happens… I’m glad we’re here together.” Sullivan struggles with his response, eyes heavy with concern. Instead of words, he places a firm hand on Cameron’s shoulder, letting it linger just a second longer than protocol permits. It’s a gesture of solidarity and something more personal. Both men are acutely aware of their surroundings, so they part with just that touch. But in that brief contact, a line is crossed – an acknowledgement of affection that goes beyond camaraderie. Each walks away with a mix of solace and yearning. We, as the audience, feel the **quiet burn of their suppressed love**, intensifying as the drums of war begin to thunder on the horizon.

# Episode 4 – “Flashpoint”

**Synopsis:** In this mid-season peak, the Gulf War officially begins. The episode covers the transition from tense anticipation to the outbreak of hostilities in January 1991. It intertwines explosive action with personal crises, as characters face the real prospect of death and discovery.

* **Operation Desert Storm – Air War Begins:** The deadline passes without Iraqi retreat, and in the early hours of January 17, 1991, Operation Desert Storm is launched[people.com](https://people.com/boots-show-ending-explained-netflix-11829288#:~:text=In%20real%20life%2C%20President%20Bush,Iraqi%20forces%20didn%27t%20leave%20Kuwait). Cameron’s unit is awakened before dawn by sirens and the distant thunder of jets. The sky to the north lights up as coalition aircraft strike Iraqi targets. Anti-aircraft tracer fire is seen on the horizon, and the Marines watch in a mix of awe and trepidation[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/the-gulf-war-idJPRTXAOZG/#:~:text=Image%3A%20,HeadLine). The desert night suddenly feels very real and very dangerous. Orders come down for all troops to don MOPP gear (chemical protective suits and gas masks) due to fears of an Iraqi chemical counterattack. We see the platoon hurriedly suiting up, injecting nerve-agent antidote injectors into their thighs prophylactically, hands shaking. Cameron’s terror is palpable as he fumbles with his gas mask straps, remembering training about how a single mistake could be fatal. Sullivan appears, calmly helping secure Cameron’s mask and reminding him to breathe steadily. In a muffled voice through the mask, Sullivan quips, “Can’t have you passing out on me.” Even in chaos, their bond is a source of steadiness.
* **Scud Alert:** Shortly after, an alarm sounds – incoming missile. The base scrambles; everyone dives into bunkers as a SCUD missile launched by Iraq streaks overhead. A **distant boom** follows. Thankfully, it lands far from the Marine camp (perhaps intercepted by a Patriot missile or simply missing its mark). The Marines endure the scare crouched together in dark trenches. In one trench, Cameron huddles next to Ray, who mutters a nervous joke about wishing he’d brought the lucky rabbit’s foot his girlfriend gave him. Across the way, Sullivan leads another fire team in prayer as dirt shakes from the impact. This sequence ratchets up tension, showing that **even before ground combat, the war is perilous**. After all-clear, the camera pans over dust-covered, wide-eyed young Marines – a collective sigh of relief that they’re still alive.
* **The Pressure Mounts:** Over the next days, the air war rages. The Marines aren’t yet in direct combat, but they feel the reverberations – literally (through nightly airstrike rumbles) and mentally (knowing the invasion is imminent). Some struggle with anxiety and fear of the unknown. One recruit, Pvt. Hicks, freezes up during a live-fire drill, overwhelmed by the sound of nearby bombing runs. He admits to Cameron later that he isn’t sure he’ll be brave when the bullets start flying for real. Cameron, grappling with his own fear, nonetheless steps into a supportive role: he reminds Hicks that they all got through the Crucible together and that they’ll watch out for each other in battle too. This conversation shows Cameron growing into a leadership role among his peers – a sign of his maturation.
* **Sullivan in Danger of Exposure:** Meanwhile, an external threat looms for Sullivan. A new intelligence officer arrives at camp – **Lieutenant Miller**, tasked with gathering any compromising information on troops (especially regarding potential security risks). Unbeknownst to Sullivan, Miller has been briefed on the prior investigation into Sullivan’s personal life. We see Miller leafing through a confidential dossier containing Sullivan’s name with the word “**Article 125**” (the code for the military’s ban on homosexual conduct at the time) circled. The war hasn’t erased bigotry within the ranks. In a tense scene, Miller subtly interrogates Sullivan under the guise of checking unit morale. He pointedly asks if Sullivan has anyone special waiting back home and whether he spends a lot of time with “his boys” in the platoon. Sullivan, knowing exactly what’s happening, maintains a poker face and curtly answers that his only focus is the mission. But the encounter leaves him shaken – the threat of being outed *during* a war is a cruel shadow hanging over him. **Stakes Raise:** Sullivan is now fighting on two fronts: the external war and the internal battle to keep his true self hidden.
* **Battle of Khafji (Cliffhanger):** As January nears its end, Iraqi forces launch a surprise move across the border, leading to the **Battle of Khafji** (a real Gulf War engagement around January 29, 1991). Cameron’s platoon is sent forward as part of a force to repel a sudden Iraqi incursion into the Saudi town of Al-Khafji at night. The episode’s latter half becomes an intense combat sequence – the first taste of ground battle for our characters. Tracer bullets whip across the streets of the town as the Marines, alongside Saudi and coalition forces, engage in urban firefights. Cameron sticks close to Ray and their fire team, clearing building by building. In a heart-stopping moment, they take fire from Iraqi soldiers holed up in a second-story window. Pinned behind a wall, Cameron hears that one of their buddies, Hicks, is hit in the open. Without hesitation, he and Ray dash out under fire to drag Hicks to cover, much like Cameron once carried a wounded recruit in training. They succeed, but Cameron finds himself separated from his unit in the smoky chaos, just as more Iraqi reinforcements counterattack. At this critical juncture, **Sullivan appears through the haze** with his Recon squad, having arrived to reinforce the Marines. He locks eyes with Cameron in relief (“I’ve got you, Marine!” he shouts), and together they regroup the scattered men. Sullivan’s leadership and Cameron’s bravery turn the tide in their sector – we see them fighting almost back-to-back at one point, protecting each other in a hail of gunfire. The Marines ultimately reclaim Khafji by dawn, but not without cost: Hicks survives his wound, though badly injured, and is evacuated. Several others are not so lucky; the sight of flag-draped bodies being loaded for transport is sobering. Cameron, hands trembling after the adrenaline fades, realizes he has blood on his uniform – some his own (minor shrapnel cuts), some from carrying Hicks. Sullivan checks on him, briefly touching Cameron’s cheek under the guise of wiping dirt off, and quietly praises him: “You did good, son.” It’s the first time Sullivan has ever used a fatherly tone, and it nearly brings Cameron to tears on the spot.
* **Emotional Cliffhanger:** As medics carry away the wounded and the company regroups, a photographer snaps a shot of Sullivan and Cameron standing amidst the rubble, the younger Marine looking up at the sergeant with weary, profound respect. (This could mirror iconic wartime photography). The episode ends on a cliffhanger back home: Barbara sees a breaking news report about the Battle of Khafji and scans the footage anxiously. In one grainy news photo flashed on screen, she **recognizes Cameron’s face** among the Marines in Kuwait – dirty, exhausted, but alive and doing his duty. The episode cuts to black as Barbara gasps in relief and collapses into sobs, the emotional toll of worry and pride overwhelming her. The war has now fully erupted, and nothing will be the same for these characters.

I don't recommend anyone else try this with me without consulting a professional first. The foods seem harmless, but this could for example--cause interaction with medications/substances or other problems depending on your own baseline (as we'll not all be the same.) This a reboot sequence for the gut flora. This is based on recent research in \*MICE\*. Kennedy's mouse-model study provides a clear four-stage roadmap, emphasizing diet-driven restoration after severe microbiome disruption. The timelines for mice do \*not\* map onto humans, so I will be using an interoceptive/holistic approach--rather than projecting rigid timelines.

**Phase 1: Pioneer Colonizers (Resistant starches; Gentle prebiotics)**

Staples:

\- Potatoes (bulk bag)

\- Oats (bulk)

\- Dried beans (variety if possible)

\- Apples (cooked; whatever's cheap)

Method:

\- Cook potatoes/rice, let cool overnight in fridge

\- Eat cold or reheated (resistant starch forms when cooled)

\- Oatmeal (let it cool a bit before eating)

\- Beans (cook big batch, store)

Goal: Trying to stabilize digestion

**Phase 2: Network Builders (Inulin sources; FOS sources)**

Add:

\- Onions

\- Garlic

\- Leeks (if affordable)

\- Slightly green bananas

Signal to add Phase 2:

\- Phase 1 foods feel comfortable

\- Digestion stabilizing

\- Body says ""ready for more""

Goal: So, this is the fart phase... Is restoration worth it?

**Phase 3: Competitive Exclusion**

Add:

\- N-Acetyl-Cysteine supplement 600-1200mg/day (when you can afford it)

\- Lactoferrin (harder to source, skip unless affordable)

\- Maybe sauerkraut/fermented foods (if tolerated)

Signal:

\- Feeling plateau in progress

\- Ready to address pathogens

\- Cravings shifting

Goal: Dismantle pathogenic biofilms, let beneficial microbes dominate

**Phase 4: Keystone Stabilization (Polyphenols)**

Add:

\- Dark berries (frozen cheapest)

\- Green tea/coffee

\- Cranberries when on sale

\- Pomegranate (optional)

Signal:

\- Everything feels integrated

\- Ready to stabilize/maintain

Hypothesis being: By the time I get to phase 4, I should notice:

\- Improved gut health

\- Improved mental health

\- Improved physical resilience",1,1761878796.0,Microbiome,0,1.0,False

Looking for a Halloween partner-in-crime to get to know\~

Be it to grab a cozy coffee, chat the day away or maybe watch a movie. If we do pick a scary one, bonus points if you laugh at jump scares like I do\~

No tricks, only treats - just two humans trying to make the most of spooky season before the Mariah Carey Christmas takeover begins.

I’m also totally open to other plans — exploring the city, trying out your favorite food spot, or just finding a quiet corner to talk and see if we click. It’s really about the connection — meeting someone genuine to share a few laughs and good vibes with.

A bit about me -

Looking for something more than just small talk and surface-level connections, I seek depth and I seek substance. Something long term that ages like fine wine, not something short term that fizzles out like soda pop.

Someone to call my own. To talk about anything and everything with, to chat the day away, watch movies / binge on shows with each other, explore the city and cute cafés together, A genuine connection of mind, body and soul. My person, us against the world.

Witty banter, endless memes, and conversations that go far beyond the surface. I don’t want just passion, I want emotion. I want romance. I want chemistry that sets us both on fire.

I’m 29, fit body with a sharp mind and a creative soul. A lover of all things nature, food, and animals. I’ve got messy hair, a dimple on my left cheek, and eyes that see deeper than most.

I want to be your favorite notification and your go to distraction. I want to make your heart skip a beat when you see my name pop up on your screen, make you smile from cheek to cheek and bite your lips at the same time.

For unless it's mad, passionate, extraordinary love, it's a waste of time. There are many mediocre things in life, love should not be one of them.

1okjchn,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1okjchn/hes_powerful_and_admired_but_treated_me_terribly/,He’s powerful and admired but treated me terribly. Was this abuse?,"I (32F) got involved with a somewhat older and very successful man (43M) who works in the same industry as me. He’s well known and respected, which made the connection feel exciting and validating at first. I met him at a professional event and asked for advice about my career. He was friendly and generous, said we should grab coffee, and asked for my number so his assistant could set it up. At that time, my ask was strictly professional. I didn't have any romantic or physical attraction to him.

Over the next month, he kept rescheduling our Zoom calls, then started texting me directly. At first, the messages were light and friendly. Then it became every day, small check-ins. Like asking about my day. How my workout was. How my evening was going. Was I looking forward to my next gig in NYC. It all seemed very innocent on the surface, but I felt there was more going on. However, I didn't want to assume.

When I came back to NYC for work, he insisted we have dinner. It was storming that night, so he invited me to his place to order in. I was nervous but agreed. The night started off light, but there was tension building between us. He’d touch my leg when making a point or hold eye contact a little too long. I finally asked if there was something happening between us, and he acted confused. He said he was just a friendly person, and it was common for him to ""touch"" his friends. I remember feeling embarrassed and said maybe I should just go. That’s when he suddenly asked if I wanted to have sex with him. I hesitated and said “maybe.” He asked again, and when I said “yes,” he kissed me. Things escalated quickly. He became very passionate, almost like he had been holding back for weeks. It felt intense and disorienting.

After that, we started seeing each other, and it got confusing fast. He introduced a “Daddy/baby” dynamic that I didn’t ask for but went along with. He could be warm and affectionate, then distant or cruel. He would encourage me in my career and offer really great advice. He'd check-in on me, congratulate me, express how proud he was of me. How beautiful he thought I was and how intelligent I was. But he also yelled at me, accused me of “victimizing” myself when I cried, and made degrading jokes about things we had done. He also crossed physical boundaries in ways that scared me, like grabbing my face when I spoke during an argument. He told me I made him act the way he did. That I was pulling it out of him, making him act ""not like himself"", and that his ego was too big to deal with me. It was emotionally exhausting and ruined some of my confidence.

I finally blocked him a few weeks ago after he told me he was “done with me” during an argument, then started texting me again like nothing happened. Going no contact has helped a bit, but I still feel hooked emotionally and physically. Everyone else sees him as this brilliant, admired person, and I feel like I met someone completely different.

Has anyone else dealt with something like this? Especially when the person had power or influence? How do I let go and stop questioning myself? And I'm not sure if what I experienced was abuse or not. It's confusing.",3,1761878703.0,abusiverelationships,3,1.0,False

1okj8fx,https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningToBecome/comments/1okj8fx/life_advice_stop_being_mysterious_on_purpose_how/,[Life Advice] Stop being “mysterious” on purpose: how social isolation is killing your vibe (and your health),"Been seeing this a lot lately. People my age, mid-20s to early 30s, talking about how they “don't have the energy” to talk to friends, or how texting back feels like a chore, or how they ghost people not out of malice but because they “just can’t deal.” And then scrolling through TikTok, you’ll find entire communities romanticizing being the “quiet loner” with zero friends and a mysterious aura. 

But here’s the truth: being socially disconnected isn’t an aesthetic. It’s a slow-motion train wreck for your mental and physical health. No, you’re not just introverted. You might be socially malnourished.

This post is a reality check meets toolkit. It’s based on real research, actual psychology, and real-world advice from experts who’ve studied human behavior and loneliness for decades. Not just some viral “that girl” influencer telling you to “protect your energy” by cutting off everyone and living in isolation with your matcha and crystals. 

Let’s be clear: if you're feeling disconnected, it's not your fault. Modern life has made it dangerously easy to avoid people, and the algorithm rewards disengagement. But the good news is that social skills can be rebuilt, and happiness can be recovered. Here’s how.

- A Harvard study that tracked people for over 80 years (yes, *80*) found that the #1 predictor of happiness and longevity wasn’t money, career success, or even physical health—it was the quality of relationships. Robert Waldinger, director of the study, said in his TED Talk that “good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Full stop.”

- Dr. Vivek Murthy, the U.S. Surgeon General, called loneliness the next public health crisis. In his 2023 advisory, he said lacking social connection is as dangerous as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Yeah, fifteen. Daily. That’s how bad isolation is for your body and mind.

- Neuroscientist Matthew Lieberman, author of *Social: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Connect*, argues that social interaction isn’t optional—it’s a basic human need, like food and water. When we don’t get enough, our brain goes into survival mode. That’s why loneliness can feel like physical pain.

So what can you actually *do* to reconnect with people, even when it feels awkward, exhausting, or pointless? Here’s the no-BS game plan.

- Call instead of text. Voice calls are scientifically more fulfilling because they engage more of your brain’s social circuits. A study from the University of Texas found that hearing someone’s voice creates stronger emotional bonds than texting does. Even a 5-minute check-in call can do more for your connection than a month of gray bubble texts.

- Say hi to strangers. At the coffee shop. At the grocery store. To your barista. These micro-interactions matter more than you think. Research from the University of British Columbia shows that casual chats with strangers significantly improve your mood and sense of belonging. It’s not small talk, it’s social nutrition.

- Make the plan. Don’t wait to be invited. The “no one ever reaches out to me” loop is a trap. Be the one who initiates. Even if it flops, you exercised your social agency, which builds confidence. People are generally way more open to connecting than you assume.

- Stop overthinking how you come across. Social anxiety often comes from hyper-self-focus. But a meta-analysis from the American Psychological Association shows that people walk away from social interactions liking you *more* than you think. This is called the “liking gap.” You’re not awkward. You’re just overthinking it.

- Don’t aim to be interesting. Aim to be interested. Dale Carnegie said it best in *How to Win Friends and Influence People*: “You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you.” Ask questions. Be curious. People remember how you made them feel.

- Have recurring plans. One-off hangouts are great, but recurring ones build real bonds. A monthly dinner. A weekly walk. A group chat that leads to real-world events. Consistency is what creates depth.

- Stop assuming people don’t want to hear from you. This assumption kills most connections before they begin. A study in *Nature Human Behaviour* found that people significantly underestimate how much others appreciate being reached out to. Send the text. Make the call. They’re probably waiting too.

- Build a “low-maintenance” friend list. These are the people you can talk to once every few months and pick up where you left off. Don’t ghost them. Reach out when the thought comes to mind. It doesn’t have to be deep. Just a “hey, thinking about you” goes a long way.

- Consider leaving group chats that drain you. Not all social interaction is healthy. You need *meaningful* connection, not constant noise. Quality > quantity. It’s okay to curate your social environment.

- Practice “social reps.” Like going to the gym, consistency builds social muscle. Start small. Say hi to your neighbor. Compliment someone’s outfit. These reps build familiarity and reduce social fear over time.

- Use tech intentionally, not passively. Social media can *simulate* connection without actually giving you any. Rule of thumb: if you're not actively chatting with someone or making plans, you're consuming—not connecting.

- Read *Lost Connections* by Johann Hari. This book breaks down how modern life has severed us from real relationships, and what we can do to rebuild them. It’s a must-read if you’ve been feeling isolated but can’t explain why.

- Watch the episode “What Makes a Good Life?” by The School of Life on YouTube. It’s short, deep, and brutally honest. It explains why intimacy isn’t a luxury—it’s a survival need.

- Stop labeling yourself as “anti-social” or “awkward.” Those labels become self-fulfilling. You’re not broken. You’re probably just out of practice.

Loneliness doesn’t look like crying alone in your room. It looks like endlessly scrolling. Ghosting friends back. Avoiding calls. Telling yourself you’re “just too tired” when actually, you're socially starved.

You don’t need a huge circle. You just need real connection. So yeah, talk to people. Call people. Say hi. Make the plan. You don’t need to be perfect. You just need to show up.

Your happiness literally depends on it.

* Down payment assistance for prospective homeowners
* Vocational training in “AI” and “tech” (Because people need a way to make money, if they’re going to get rental assistance because it’s not an ongoing subsidy)
* Tiny homes
* Small business incubator, which they’d give market rental rates to businesses in their program, so these SMBs would be businesses, like coffee shops or retailers
* Community festivals and events (Seriously? What a benefit! Especially when the majority of people won’t be able to afford to attend them!)

Hey everyone!

I’ve never used commercial espresso equipment before, but I’m about to start a new job soon where I’ll be working on a high-end Italian espresso machine (I’ll get the exact name from my boss, but it’s around the $6k range). I’m super excited, but also a little nervous because I feel like my milk steaming technique still isn’t where it should be.

I’m completely self-taught — I’ve never been trained by a professional or a seasoned barista before. I’ve watched tons of tutorials online and practiced a lot, but I still struggle with getting good texture.

I used a Breville Barista Express when I worked on a coffee truck, and now I have a Casabrew CM5418™ at home. I can get that “vortex” motion everyone talks about, but my milk still turns out thin. It basically sinks straight to the bottom, and I don’t get that creamy, glossy microfoam. Definitely not enough texture to even attempt latte art.

I usually steam oat milk, but I’ve tested with whole milk too and get the same results — so I don’t think it’s just the milk.

Is this more likely an issue with my technique, or just the limitations of a cheaper home machine?

That’s why lately, I have been obsessed with the idea of self-care baskets, they are such a simple but thoughtful way to take care of yourself or someone you love.

I recently put together my ideas on **Self care Basket Ideas** that covers how to create themed baskets for every mood, personality, and budget. Whether you’re making one for yourself or putting together a thoughtful gift, there’s something special for everyone. Honestly, it's one of the most satisfying DIYs I’ve done.

You can go in so many directions with these baskets depending on personality or mood. For example:

* **Relaxation & Spa Basket:** Bath bombs, scented candles, luxurious body oils, bubble bath. Add a soft towel or soothing music playlist, and it’s the perfect kit for anyone who needs to unwind and relax after a tiring day.
* **Cozy Night-In Basket:** Fuzzy socks, herbal tea, a comfy blanket, and fairy lights. Include a good book or journal to make it extra comforting for nights when you just want to recharge quietly.
* **For skincare lovers** – A nice mix of a face mask, moisturizer, lip balm, and gua sha tool. It’s a small but pampering way to help someone glow and feel refreshed.
* **For creative minds** – Paint sets, calligraphy pens, puzzles, or DIY kits. Perfect for those who love relaxing through art or hands-on hobbies.
* **For the foodie friend** – Snacks, coffee, chocolates, and a cute mug. You can even toss in a gourmet treat or baking mix for a cozy weekend activity.
* **Stress-Relief Basket:** Perfect for easing daily stress. Aromatherapy diffusers, mindfulness or guided meditation cards, coloring books for adults, and soothing teas to calm anxious minds.
* **Tech-Lover’s Basket:** Smart gadgets and cozy accessories like wireless sleep headphones, blue light blocking glasses, a self-heating coffee mug, LED therapy lights, mini  massagers and many more for gadget enthusiasts who love their tech but need a break too.

It’s really fun to mix and match stuff or keep it themed. You can also personalize them with a handwritten note or the person’s favorite scent or color.

Hope is a skittish thing,

Like prey that slips my clutches.

I unclasp my hands to see only my empty palms

And it’s already miles away.

Dejected in a barren tundra,

It waddles up beside me.

Infuriating little beast!

It returns with a few crumbs to sustain me,

Bearing a tender heart.

Though I don’t appreciate its sense of humor.

For, like a fool, I search for it

Buried under the depths of cold despair

Or far inside the darkest caverns of terror.

Attracted to the chimes of laughter at family dinners,

1okirjq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1okirjq,Is freeze distilled milk worth the hype ?,"Today I made a iced latte with freeze distilled milk 
After the whole hype around it a few years ago I had tried it back then but honestly I wasn’t even cultured enough at that point on what it really meant for the milk to taste better, even today I don’t consider myself knowledgeable enough to critique it but here’s what I have to say about it.

The process: I froze about half a litre of milk in a container and then had it angled to slow melt into another container in the fridge. yelling about 200ml of great milk, the rest went back into the milk used at home for other stuff.

What comes out as the product of this is true like nothing you have tasted before, this milk has a weight, texture and taste like no other. It is Dense 
As close as it could be to condense milk without the added sweetness, maybe that’s a little exaggerated but honestly if you like milk in your coffee this is worth a try!

The issue arises with the effort it takes to make it,
which really makes this something only for special occasions.

Today I brewed a coffee with lavazza il mattino vivace, something I bought out of pure desperation, I ran out of coffee grounds 2 days ago and I dint want to use my coffee grounds I bought from Vietnam and I had a order for some grounds on its way with an eta a few days out, these grounds have been the most basic, non exciting and mundane coffee I have ever had, I saw someone recommending them and I couldn’t feel sorrier for them. It felt like a waste of the milk on this coffee.

Atleat it looked pretty☕️
Happy brewing everyone.

I'm formulating a report/business plan for my boss who runs a cafe, for practice mainly but also just curious to see as someone hoping to own a shop some day). 

I was curious on this subs thoughts on machines like the Bellwether? For the concept, location would be super small, sharing spotlight between crafted coffee and mocktails in a stylish, intimate setting. 

What attracts me about the Bellwether is the ventless aspect and small footprint with this particular concept, and thinking ahead in terms of affordability with tariffs causing our coffee purchase to rocket up. 

  
For more context: 

Cafe I work at is probably 60%/40% food focused vs. coffee focused. We make a better margin on food, but still have a ton of regulars just popping in for a cup. To be clear, we are NOT hitting a particularly specialty coffee crowd. All staff shares work, so we jump between food and coffee a lot, and as a result we typically neglect to dial in/weigh shots/taste a lot. Regardless, we keep a steady clientele of local workers and go through probably 5 lbs a day in espresso, alongside a few pounds of drip. 

  
Recently, our coffee supplier has had to pass on some tariff costs and it's adding hundreds (almost a thousand) in extra costs at the end of the month. I've posed the idea of roasting in-house to save money, maybe with a Bellwether. This also coincides with another space nearby becoming vacant, which my boss pictured as a good spot for a more craft coffee/mocktail social bar---and perhaps room for a roaster to supply the main cafe as well. 

Here are my main views on pros:

1. No vent (tough landlord situation) 

2. Small physical footprint (very small space) 

3. Easily trainable (good for a well-rounded, but stretched-thin staff) 

4. Cut heavily on coffee costs (debatable, considering price and hours) 

  
So does anyone here have more recent experience with using machines like the Bellwether? I've had coffee from a Bellwether before and I've been pretty satisfied, especially for the purposes of our cafe. Most reports from this sub are a bit older, but mostly negative. Any alternatives that are more reliable? More affordable? ",0,1761876887.0,roasting,0,0.5,False

For context, I live in a major city in California (not San Francisco or Los Angeles but close in population) and I work at a coffee shop and I recently transfered to a brand new location that opened just a few weeks ago. I sh*t you not, almost every day there is a call to the police, and they are so utterly USELESS its not even funny. They just show up, make an excuse for being late, then leave. Here's some of my (least) favorite anecdotes from the last 3 weeks

1. We basically have a resident homeless woman. She even wears an orange jumpsuit that says ""convict"" on it. She walks into our bathrooms (coorperate wants us to have a severe enough *incident* before letting us get keypad locks) and makes an absolute mess. She locks herself in there for sometimes an hour or more. First time she walked in, she took a water bottle and opened it, spilling it everywhere before we asked her to leave, to which she responds ""f*ck out of my face"" while we were all atleast 10 feet away from her. She came back the next day, and stole something in broad day light, which fine, doesnt come out of my paycheck but coorperate still finds a way to fault us which is what people dont understand. A week ago, she locked herself in the bathroom and the SSV managed to get it open, to which the woman who was just staring at the mirror turns around and starts swinging at her. And you guessed it, the police did nothing. We actively had to lock the doors and inconvenience literally everyone else just to keep her out until the police would get there (they didnt) so we waited till she walked away.
She comes back again YESTERDAY and AGAIN tries to assualt one of the SSVs. But until the police can actually catch her if they can even show up in time, no charges can be pressed and we cant trespass her from property. 

2. One guy came in, showered in our bathroom for 30 minutes and this poor pregnant lady had to hold her pee until he left, to which she couldn't even go because he made a mess and had to wait till we cleaned it up (luckily we  got the other bathroom open before then) bro has the audacity to tell the SSV ""have a nice day"" before walking out. She spent 45 cleaning up his mess, which in turn took a person off the floor inconviniencing the rest of us.

3. This guy comes in and sits down with a bag of God knows what. Somehow he got his hands on a glass of milk, and managed to spill it all around him on the chair, table, and ground. A coworker asked him to move which he ignored, so she went to get my manager and the SSV. See funny thing, the manager, SSV, and coworker are all black. So when they came out and asked him to leave, he called them n*****s with the hard R 13 times (I counted) and started getting physically aggresive, to which I grabbed the pocket knife I carry on me in my hand and watched incase he attacked my coworkers. He went up the street and started yelling at some kids. Oh and he was carrying a cardboard sign that said God bless (No hate like christian love)(joke).

4. This one was actually kind of funny, it inconvinieninced us a bit, but still I giggle at the performance. He walks in, picks up two random drinks and acts like hes looking at the names, nods his head approvingly before walking out. One of those drinks was 2 hours old. We did end up having to remake one, but honestly he deserved the drink for that Oscar worthy performance

5. The insufferable amount of needless arguements over water. Believe me, I had no problem giving them water, because they would just take it and leave. Now, its full blown arguments with people who are genuinely so mentally handicapped they have the reasoning of a small child and throw tantrums which can sometimes become violent. I feel bad, and I would give them water if I could. 

6. Yesterday I pulled out of the parking lot and was stopped at the light next to the store. A random homeless guy walked out infront of me trying to punch my car. Luckily the light turned green and I swerved around him but 911 got a more annoyed then frantic call because I wasnt the only car he punched lmfao.

7. Some guy sat on our patio and was downing beers and being disruptive, ofcourse PD couldn't kick their butts to come and get him out before we had to kick him out which luckily did not result in a violent outburst.

This all happened in the last 3 weeks, and this is just what IVE seen

Now I need to clarify a few things. I have empathy for those in Incompacitated mental states who legitimately are in complete self-preservation mode, and those who genuinely are out there against their will. I however, am not equipped to help or accommodate them in any way despite interacting with them on a daily basis, nor is it my job. 

The vast majority of them that come in or around the store are severely mentally ill, and to put it simply, walking powder kegs. They are unpredictable to a basically scary degree and can become violent at the drop of a hat. And here's the thing, alot of them are schizophrenic, and come in already aggitated/distressed. We arent trained to deal with that other then asking them to leave and calling the cops if they dont. So if there comes a time where I get assualted because yes, that has happened to other people infront of me, for my protection I might have to make a decision that costs me my job or gets me arrested despite it being self defense because California . To make things worse, the area im in also has alot of drug users, which can be scary in their own right. They will do drugs right outside the building, which is next to a school by the way.

And for the ""nOt aLl oF tHeM"" crowd we do have maybe one or two homeless people who are just chill, come in, buy a water bottle or tall coffee and just chill in the cafe, which is fine because they are respectful and not destroying property or posing a legitimate threat to our safety. ""Well i worked at _____ homeless shelter and"" im talking about the people who DONT want help. Who REFUSE help. Who want to be out there and not apart of functioning society. 

What irks me is whenever I say anything some social justice warrior pops who does not live in nor experiences this environment on a daily basis like I do tells me how ""terrible of a person I am, that these people deserve basic dignity"", and ""well you work a low-income job you're one step away from the people you look down upon"". I WANT THESE PEOPLE TO GET HELP. I DONT THINK THAT THEY DESERVE TO BE ON THE STREET, IF I THOUGHT THAT I WOULDNT BE COMPLAINING THAT THEY ARE ON THE DAMN STREET. I WANT THE BEST FOR THESE PEOPLE, FOR THEM TO HAVE SHELTER, TO EAT, TO GET THE PSYCHIATRIC HELP THEY NEED. YOU CAN OFFER DIGNITY TO SOMEONE BUT THEY CAN ACTIVELY REFUSE THAT, AND STILL REMAIN ON THE STREET, WHICH IS WHAT ALOT OF THEM DO. And you UNO reversed yourself because you called me poor and looked down on me by accusing me of saying that I looked down on the despite working a minimum wage job. 

Im tired of being the bad guy for saying I want to work in a clean and safe space and not have constant threats to my safety",0,1761876786.0,Vent,1,0.5,False

1okim5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1okim5o/whats_the_most_entitled_guest_youve_ever/,What's the most entitled guest you've ever encountered?,"We had a doozy last weekend. 

As a background, the unit is listed as a ""cabin in the woods"" and the listing has an overhead map showing the layout of the property, and specifically says that the unit requires a 125ft walk. The digital guidebook, which a link is sent twice before checkout, also shows the map, the distance, and says not to drive off the parking area. There's also a shared bathhouse and coffee bar which is shared between 3 units. This is VERY clear in our listings.

Here's what they did: 


- Drove their car 125ft off of the parking area, to the rental unit. It's VERY clearly not a place where you'd drive. It's grass and trees with no hint of any kind of trail. It had also rained, so the yard was soft.

- When we messaged them and very nicely asked them to not drive off of the parking area, they replied ""ok, but it would have been nice to know that the unit was so far away from the parking, you should provide a golf cart"". (Actually, we do provide a golf cart, but the control unit went out a couple weeks ago and it's still in the shop-- but we don't mention the golf cart in the listing or the Guidebook). 


- one night, they left a tied-up plastic grocery bag on the counter of the (public) coffee bar. There were 2 coffee mugs in there, but we didn't open it. We just took it into our area so nobody else would take it. We also planned on washing the mugs. The next morning at 7am, our management company got a message saying ""I don't know what the owners of this property are doing, but they stole our coffee mugs and our creamer and sweeteners. We want them back RIGHT NOW!!!"" Management company replied within 10 minutes and said they'd get in touch with us and find out what's going on. I was driving so I didn't see the message until about 8am. 
The guests proceeded to message every 10 minutes between 7-8am with increasingly threatening and rude/accusatory messages, threatening to ""give us bad reviews everywhere"" and ""how can you do business with thieves?"" and ""we can't use this shitty creamer and we want our coffee now!""

(We actually contacted Airbnb at this point, to try to evict them since we felt threatened and unsafe with them staying. Airbnb refused to help, but still notified them that we wanted to evict them! So, we had to deal with them on our property for 2 more nights!)

- We live in the same building that houses our ""bathhouse"", which has the bathrooms and coffee bar. We have a (locked) door that leads from our owners apartment to the hallway of the bathhouse. The morning after the first incident, the guests pounded on this door at 6:30am because ""someone took the coffee pot"". Which was sort-of true... We took one of them to wash overnight and the dishwasher finished at 3am. We had planned on returning it that morning. But even so, there's a 2nd pot in clear view on a shelf over the coffee maker. 

- They then rummaged through the cabinet and STOLE a box of like 50 little creamers and an entire pack of filters. Yes, the same creamers that they called ""shitty"" the morning before. We actually have them on the Blink doorbell camera that's on the outside door of the bathhouse, showing them carrying the box of creamers!

- That same morning, they purposely left the showers in both bathrooms messy. They left liquid soap all over the sit-down bench in BOTH showers. They left our provided shampoo bottle open and laying on its side leaking shampoo in one shower. And they left their towels (2 in one and 3 in the other) laying on the floor. There's a large hamper in the bathroom, plus multiple towel hooks. This was done on purpose. 

- After check-out, they claimed that the heater wasn't working. So I went over and checked. It was working fine, and on top of that, they threw the huge warm comforter and one of our extra blankets in the floor in the corner of the unit, but they were using a lighter comforter. They clearly removed those items from the bed before they went to sleep, because if they were ""stripping"" the bed, they would have also stripped the other comforter, and other blanket, and the top/bottom sheets.

1okilzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/uktravel/comments/1okilzp/critique_my_itinerary_traveling_to_london_for/,Critique my itinerary: traveling to London for seven nights with my mom in December,"My mom and I are traveling to London from the US in late November to early December. Neither of us have ever been before. I’ve created a fairly detailed itinerary, but not sure how realistic it is (distances to get to places, how long we’re going to spend in each spot, etc.). Example, I’m not sure what time to reserve for Sunday roast, our afternoon tea, and other reservations because I don’t know how long the activities we have planned prior to that are going to take. For context, I’m mid-30’s and my mom is in her early 60’s. She had a hip replacement 2.5 years ago so we’re thinking we will be utilizing the tube/bus system more than walking due to this, but if certain things are ridiculously close to each other, we’re hoping she’ll be able to walk it (please let us know if you know certain things are doable for walking). I’m trying to plan a lighter day toward the end of our trip so we can go back to things we may have missed or not been able to stay long enough at. The Christmas markets are a must for us! Anyway, let me know if this looks at all feasible, if you would add/remove anything, any food recommendations (we prefer eating as we’re strolling around instead of sitting down three times a day for a big meal), and any other tips!

1okih8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/microsaas/comments/1okih8s/my_saas_product_got_its_first_250/,My SaaS Product Got Its First $250! 🎉,"Hey Reddit fam,

I can't believe this moment is finally here – my SaaS product is generating revenue, and I’m over the moon! 🌕

A Little Backstory

I started this journey with just an idea. A small, scrappy prototype built during late nights, fueled by endless cups of coffee (and a few mental breakdowns 😅). Honestly, I doubted myself a million times. Who would care about my product? Who would even pay for it?

You know the one – ""You've received a payment of $19."" It took me a second to process, and then it hit me like a freight train.

What My Product Does

The product is Its a software solution that is useful for at least a few reasons I can think of:⁠

1. Its a reddit tool that helps you find the best unmoderated subreddits for you to promote yourself or to claim these subreddits. The database containing the subreddits is constantly updated. Another feature is allowing you to see the best time to post in any sub.
2. Can be used to find abandoned subreddits with active, engaged members but no moderation team. By claiming these subreddits, you take control of a ready-made community in your niche—perfect for building authority, driving traffic, or even monetizing through ads, affiliate links, or memberships. Or if you're just passionate about the topic and want to run it yourself :)
3. ⁠Don’t want to take ownership, you can still use the database to identify subreddits relevant to your niche and post your content, products, or services here.
4. You get the best time to post in a subreddit, this ensuring the best visibility of the post.


Why This Means So Much to Me

I’m not some big startup founder with investors throwing money at me. I don’t have a fancy office or a huge team. It’s just me, grinding every day, figuring things out as I go. This $19 is so much more than just money – it’s validation. It’s proof that someone, somewhere, found enough value in what I’ve built to actually pay for it.

What’s Next?

For me, this is just the beginning. Now that I know people are willing to pay, it’s time to double down. More features, more marketing, and maybe even more subscriptions? Let’s see how far this can go.

Thanks for reading, and if you’ve been grinding on your own project, let’s hear about it in the comments. Let’s inspire each other. 🚀

Aug 14, 2025 = Notice of interview in Ciudad Juarez / CDJ

October 17, 2025 = Interview date in Ciudad Juarez / CDJ

We chose to have my husband travel to Ciudad Juarez to take care of all of the required prelim visits and appointments, and then I flew there and joined him the day before his final interview.

Once we got notice that his interview would be on 10/17, we registered him for his biometrics appointment – the closest one to his interview was 1 full week beforehand, on 10/10.  We then scheduled his medical appointment on 10/13.  He also had to get his police certificate in CDJ.   After we started scheduling appointments, we got e-mails with instructions from each one.  We chose to take all those instructions and checklists, + print out the checklists from the NVC and US consulate website and create a ""master document"" that listed all our appointment dates, locations and times, and a list of what to bring to each one.  We found this helpful, and the staff appeared to appreciate it as well, as many people showed up either unprepared, without required paperwork, or with a stack of unorganized papers that they had to shuffle through.  It should be noted that none of the places asked for all the documents that were listed on their checklists – but it was good that he had them in case.  He heard other people being asked for documents they didn't request from him, and he was asked to produce paperwork that some others weren't.

General notes:  We took a taxi to the Centro area of CDJ,  and during his time here my husband took a taxi to Walmart.   From what we saw and experienced, the area around the US Consulate is really the nicest in the city with the largest variety of restaurants, a very solid shopping mall with a large gym, and it never felt dangerous or unsafe in any way to us.  Another note is that, my husband's taxi driver told him that one does not need an appointment to do the biometrics and medical appointments, or to get the police certificate and that many people just show up and do all 3 in the same day.  My husband chose to stick to his scheduled appointment times, but the taxi guy's comments may be worth noting.  I’ve seen other people say that when they spoke in Spanish at their interviews, they didn’t feel the same level of ease and respect as when they spoke English.  My husband didn’t have this experience and in fact, most places just spoke to him in Spanish from the start.

* He flew with Aeromexico from the USA to Mexico City and then to CDJ.  Not the cheapest option, but it flew him into Mexico, he didn’t need to worry about a border crossing, and was able to use his Mexican passport to get through TSA and onto the flight.
* We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express.  Hubby was there for 13 nights and I joined him for the last 3.  They provide a shuttle to the airport, but not a shuttle from the airport to the hotel so he used a taxi.  This hotel was not expensive, is relatively newly remodeled and updated, and is located about 2 blocks from the consulate, medical and biometrics appointments, directly across from a large shopping mall and adjacent to a decent Mexican (more like Tex-Mex) restaurant and within walking distance to many other restaurants, both chain and higher-end.  This hotel offers a free breakfast every morning and the staff were friendly and helpful.  No safe, refrigerator or microwave in the room, but each room did have a coffee maker, the TV had lots of channels and WiFi was fast, though this entire area of the city was having regular internet outages on our last 2 days here which was a struggle as I was planning to work from the hotel.
* For the police certificate, my husband just took the hotel shuttle, as they offer free transport within 10km of the hotel.   They required a copy of his passport and DS-260 confirmation with barcode.  They asked for his US address, but didn’t ask where he was born/lived in Mexico or where he was staying as we've seen mentioned elsewhere.  This process was quick; they printed out the certificate while he waited.
* Biometrics was also fast.  They wanted his DS-260 confirmation with barcode, and his passport.
* For his medical exam (he used SMF, and has he was walking there, other medical facilities had staff trying to get him to go to their offices instead), they needed his DS-260 with barcode, and proof of previous vaccinations.  The actual medical exam didn’t take long, and the physical exam was very general and wasn’t very thorough – they just quickly looked under the front and back of the gown he was given to wear, but no hernia check, etc.  He has no tattoos, but when they asked, he told them of a previous interaction with law enforcement (a minor misdemeanor that was dismissed before going to court). He was then sent to a psychologist who really interrogated him on lots of things, including facts about the police interaction and asked lots of other personal and legal questions, and took a fair amount of notes.   This part of the appointment made him feel uneasy and he really wasn’t expecting the line of questioning, so some of his answers probably could’ve been better, but he was really caught of guard by some things they were asking.   He had to get a total of 4 vaccines.
* Interview appointment – Note that the interview appointment date listed on the e-mail notice you receive is NOT the actual interview with the officer.  At this appointment they only collect documents, then if all those are complete, they assign you an interview for the following business day.  While my husband heard them asking for different documents from different people, in his case he had to give them the DS-260 forms which were marked proving he’d done the earlier appointments, marriage certificate, the police certificate from Mexico, and documents about his minor misdemeanor and the dismissal of his case in the USA.  They also asked him for a copy of his I-601A approval, which is something I’d not seen listed on any checklist, but he had it.   Note that they did not ask for any copies of the I-864 or my W2 or income tax records; we had previously uploaded all those into CEAC, so maybe that's why?  Most of the documents that were listed on various checklists were never requested here at the appointment, but again, he had them if needed.  They asked him about his misdemeanor and the dismissal, who his sponsor was and where I was at that moment.
* 2^(nd) interview appointment – Scheduled at 8:00 a.m. the morning after his documents were collected.   He got in line at around 7, and he didn’t get inside, get interviewed and finally emerge until about 11:20.  He waited in line for a very long time, and once inside he could hear and see others being interviewed and approved or denied.  He could also see that some officials were denying many while others denied very few, and some were kind and personable, while others were strictly business.  I and most everyone waiting for their spouses or family members had to wait outside, just down the street from the consulate in front of the convenience store and on the pedestrian bridge.  Cell phones weren’t allowed inside so there was no way for me to ask where he was in line or if he was close to being interviewed, etc.  He was asked who his sponsor was, where he and his sponsor lived, when he entered the USA, if he remained in the USA the entire time after that entry, he was asked about his misdemeanor and they already knew the case had been dismissed as when he explained that, the officer said ""I know"" and approved him.  We had read that you should take originals and copies of all legal documents like passports, birth certificates and marriage license, that they keep the copies and give the originals back – but in our case they handed all documents back to him along with a green slip, detailing what would happen next.  Also, he wasn’t given a packet to give to CBP when he first entered the USA as we’d seen elsewhere – they told him everything is now done electronically.
* The officer who approved his case told him it might take 3 days before he got the e-mail that his passport with the LPR sticker was ready, but in our case, on the 2^(nd) morning after his appointment, he got an e-mail at 7:15 telling him his passport would be ready in an hour.  He picked it up at the same place where his biometrics were collecgted.   We then grabbed a taxi that could take us across the bridge, through immigration and to the airport in El Paso.   He took us across the bridge and let us both out at the CBP station.  Hubby had to go in and briefly meet with officers there since it was his first entry following his approval.  There was no one in line ahead of him, and I had no line when I went through the standard CBP checkpoint and had my luggage scanned.  In all, a painless and somewhat (thankfully) uneventful process.  We then went to El Paso airport and flew home.
* Once back in the States, we went online and paid the green card fee as per the instructions in his passport, and he visited the local social security office to ensure the process of getting his SSN and card had been started.",3,1761875997.0,NationalVisaCenter,0,1.0,False

1okied2,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyromance/comments/1okied2/silver_elite_conservative_i_dont_think_so_with/,"Silver Elite, conservative? I don't think so- With Quotes!","
Hello! This is in responsive to a comment thread in the earlier Silver Elite post. I was at work and couldn't reply, and then my adhd (also pretty sure Wren has adhd lol) took over and I decided to write a mini essay filled with examples on why I *don't* think Silver Elite is conservative propaganda. Honestly, I think the author wanted to write a sexy dystopian (I think I saw an interview with her saying something along these lines). Whether you think that's right or not is not the point of this post. I'm not here to argue whether it's a good book or not. I thought it was entertaining, but not high quality work. The writing was mediocre and repetitive. But it was funny and engaging. 


Some claims were made in that other thread of it being conservative coded. Someone even called it ""MAGA Elite"". Now, if you truly think it's conservative coded, I implore you to explain why so we can have a civilized discussion. There may have been things I missed. I did read it a month or so after it came out, but my memory is not the best. I did try and go back and provide quotes with context. 


If you're not familiar with Silver Elite or didn't read it, this might be confusing for you. There are spoilers so skip this post if you don't want to be spoiled! 


I'd like to address some claims in that other thread first: 

When Wren's bff was sent to a labor camp: I tried to find the part where the person claimed that it said work will set them free, but couldn't find it. If you do, please put it in the comments (with context). She does try to rationalize that they get fed and get free time. But I think she's just wrestling with her guilt. She does regret her decision in the same quote and admits to knowing that her bff shouldn't forgive her. That a gilded cage is still a cage. There are actually many quotes of her knowing she betrayed her friend (but also saved her life and covered up a murder for her. Her being sent to a labor camp was the only way to spare her life cuz she couldn't escape).


When Wren didn't point out that basic human rights should be afforded to prisoners after Cross complained of prisoners getting more food when resources are scarce: yeah, she should've. There is no where in text tho that she agrees with Cross' words. I did provide her response tho where she says life isn't fair. Not the best response, but Wren isn't one to think too deeply. 


That it turned into a both sides are bad thing: there isn't much evidence for this. Wren is still on the uprisings side at the end, and even goes to their headquarters at the very end. She does find a letter from her uncle that says her birth parents betrayed the uprising, but there is no context for this at all. Nothing will be explained until the next book. Wren still goes to the uprising after finding the letter, however. 


I just don't like the pitchforks coming out. A lot of the time it's from people who didn't even read the material or can't name an example. They're just going off of word of mouth. Maybe think a second first before you throw accusations around. Same with accusations of AI. You could seriously end up ruining someone's life. 


Anyways the quotes are below. Apologies if the formatting is weird. I literally copied and pasted. There are a lot so the post is VERY long lol. I tried to provide examples of why I think it's not conservative coded. But again, there may have been things I missed while reading. 


Page 27
“We started running missions when I was sixteen. Small supply runs. Drop-offs. Using our ranch to hide Mods who were smuggled out of the city or the mines. It always boils my blood how many of us are still held prisoner in the labor camps scattered throughout the wards.”


Page 55
“President Severn, who ruled before General Redden, was a Mod who believed we were a superior new race. After decades of being persecuted themselves, he and his followers decided it would be a good idea to do the same to the Primes. Fools. Nothing good ever comes from the notion that one group is better than another.”



Page 114
“The thought of becoming a pawn in the General’s war machine against Mods fills me with a sickening dread.”


Page 261- Cross and Wren talking after the incitement incident


""“What happens down there goes beyond your uncle. Before the Last War, there were penitentiaries all over the world. As a society, we housed millions of criminals. Clothed them, fed them. Cold-blooded killers and child rapists living better lives than most free people. Even the ones who were sentenced to death were allowed to live for decades past their sentences. They ate three square meals a day while those who hadn’t killed or raped anyone could barely afford to eat. Evil pilfering rare resources from innocent citizens.""

I snort. “Weren’t you the one lecturing me about how life isn’t fair?”
...

“The General is obsessed with correcting the mistakes of the Old Era. That’s all my brothers and I ever heard growing up, how humanity destroyed itself. Letting chaos reign. Encouraging learned helplessness. Kids were in school until their twenties. Adults, too. All these pathetic assholes wasting time, wasting resources. If you’re not productive, you’re destructive.”
			“Is that what you believe? Efficiency and order above all?”
			His voice becomes rough. “I believe that humanity is wired for destruction no matter the environment. Old Era, New Era. Aberrant on top, Prime on top. We will always find a way to destroy ourselves. We’re a doomed species.”
			“That’s really depressing.”


Page 286- Classroom scene
“it isn’t long before the discussion becomes political, which means Lash joins the fray. He argues that the Coup was necessary, even while relenting that the General’s iron rule over our lives veers toward extreme at times.
			When the topic of the Silverblood Purge comes up, I’m surprised to hear Lyddie of all people questioning the General’s tactics.
			“I don’t know if they all needed to be killed. There had to be another solution. Especially what happened in Valterra Ridge. There were so many children there.”
			“Well, what about now?” Betima asks her. “Do you still think killing them is wrong?”
			She bites her lip. “Maybe? I don’t know.”
...
“The Continent’s former Mod leader treated the Primes abominably. I can acknowledge that, but Severn doesn’t represent all Mods. His actions are not my actions. There are good people on the Continent whose only objective is to live their lives in peace. They don’t want to oppress anyone. They don’t want to feel superior. They just want to live.”



Page 348- Wren overhearing a convo between Cross and The general after cross' brother killed another recruit: 

“Unacceptable? He did precisely what needs to be done to protect our interests. He eliminated a threat to our society, just as he’s been trained to do.”
			My blood runs cold, because the General’s endorsement of Roe’s actions is a chilling reminder of the ruthless indoctrination that permeates every aspect of our society.
			“He killed another recruit without just cause,” Cross snaps. “We don’t even know if she was a silverblood. There was no evidence to support his claim.”
 
“He acted on instinct and trusted his training. He did us a service by eliminating a potential enemy. I know you believe they’re useful for labor. You enjoy overcrowding our camps by sending the Aberrant there, recommending labor sentences over death to the Tribunal. But sometimes, son, death is the answer. Unlike you, Roe understands that.”
			“I want him out of my fucking program.”
....
“I’ve never heard Cross sound so angry. And I can’t deny I’m impressed that he’s standing up to the man who runs the Continent. This man and his warped belief that he alone holds the key to preserving order and stability. That the whole world teeters on the brink of chaos, and only with him at the helm can we right that danger.”



Page- 473 after she sleeps with Cross for the first time 
“A high that evaporates so fast it gives me whiplash.

What have I done?

He’s the General’s son.

The shame that floods my body is so unexpected, I almost start to cry. 

There’s reckless. And then there’s this.

I’m not worried about pregnancy. All female citizens of fertile age get their yearly injections, a mandate the General implemented about a decade ago. We need to report to the Company when we’re interested in starting a family. I’m worried about my judgment. My morality. My fucking soul.
What the hell.
Have I done.”



Page 556- Wren finding out they are experimenting on Mods
“Mental illness isn’t well tolerated on the Continent; the General considers treating it a waste of resources. Schizophrenia is probably the closest thing to what the fragmented experience, yet it’s rare to encounter a schizophrenic. If the General doesn’t tolerate mental illness in Primes, why would he keep Mods, of all people, alive in a hospital ward?”


Page 586- after Tana was sent to a labor camp
“As Elite, I have clearance now, and I’ve checked in with the guards at the salt camp. I can access the camp’s daily logs. I can see when Tana scans into the mine, and when she scans out. They work twelve-hour days out there. I’ve seen photos of the women’s quarters. They look comfortable. Everyone gets leisure time. The food seems decent.
			But a gilded cage is still a cage.
			And I put her there.
			She should never forgive me.”

Page 589

“ The stuff here on the base uses real coffee beans from Tierra Fe, the one export I hope never runs out, which is a valid fear given how it’s no secret the trade treaty between the Continent and our southern neighbors has been on shaky ground for years.
			At least it prevented a war, though. When those first Mods started coming into existence in the years after the Last War, Tierra Fe almost waged another one on us. They thought we were demons from hell, and a religious war nearly broke out among the remaining continents. It was the Continent’s ruler at the time who managed to thwart it. A Prime who assured Tierra Fe’s leadership that the Aberrant would be contained.
			And contain them he did.

The thought of those early Aberrant asylums reminds me of what I saw in that Ward C hospital. A roomful of people with fragmented minds.

Sadness lodges in my throat. It’s devastating to me that they’re trapped there. And they have no idea, their minds too broken to grasp what’s happening to them. But perhaps that’s better. Maybe oblivion truly is the more blissful state of being. Those fragmented people have no idea they’re trapped, but people like Tana, like Morlee Hadley, who are working at a labor camp—they know they’re prisoners.""

			“I’m not working for the Uprising.”
			“But you’ll work for the Command? You’ll help your father kill all the people who are like you?” Anger rises inside me.
			“Have you ever seen me kill a Mod?” he challenges.
			I falter. Thinking. The General’s words buzz through my mind. Accusing Cross of overcrowding the labor camps with the Aberrant. His brother killed Betima without hesitation. But Cross…He spares their lives.
			“I do more good here than I would anywhere else,” he says out loud.”""

Page 723-the general (big bad) giving a speech 

“""Violence is necessary in war. Necessary for freedom. And after twenty-five years, a quarter of a century, it’s only fitting that we reflect on the sacrifices and the triumphs that have brought us to this moment. Twenty-five years ago, the Primes of the Continent languished under the unjust grip of a corrupt and inept regime. Our society was fractured, and the will of the people was silenced by tyranny. The Aberrant wrestled society out of our ancestors’ hands and made us second-class citizens. President Severn tore the very fabric of morality by inciting the minds of both his Prime enemies and his Aberrant allies. But together, the Primes stood united in our resolve to forge a new path—a path of liberation and order. Under my guidance, we liberated ourselves from the aberrations that tried to destroy us. We cleansed the Continent, rooting out traitors and restoring honor to our institutions.”
			He pauses for dramatic effect.
			“But our journey is far from over. As we look to the future, let us remain vigilant in the face of adversity, steadfast in our commitment to preserving the peace and stability that we have fought so hard to achieve. I wasn’t asked to lead—I was called to it.”
			I try not to roll my eyes. Isn’t that what all great tyrants say? *Oh, I didn’t want this. Please take all my burdensome power away*.”""

Page 740-after Lyddie turned Wren in for being a mod:
“My heart clenches as I think about Lyddie. I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised by her betrayal. I saw her that day in shielding class—the way she recoiled at the mere thought of Amira touching her. Like Lash, her hatred of the Aberrant is so deeply rooted, I was a fool to ever think she could find the tolerance within her. That she could keep my bloodmark a secret.”

I bought it on Groupon and requested a refund but the merchant denied it through Groupon. This guy made me cry out of frustration so he can get f*ked. And he’ll get to keep my money over my dead body

What is the next step? I paid w Amex and plan to dispute it with them next. If that doesn’t work I want to escalate it to some ombudsman because he is an absolute crook. I’m in the uk btw. Adding my review for the salon below, for context. 

My review was:
I’m absolutely shocked by my experience at this salon. Never go here if you’re a woman as all you’ll feel is talked down to. I should have read the google reviews as so many experiences mimic my own. The owner of this salon seriously needs help. He is SO arrogant, rude, and uncouth. I come in and he offered me a coffee so I caught a nice vibe, and I was enjoying petting his dog as I love animals. But right away I notice the salon is very untidy, dirt all over the couch and an unclean floor. I still was ok to proceed. When he starts consulting with me, I listen and try to understand as hair color is not my expertise. What’s the problem you ask? He’s gone on for a few minutes about what HE wants to do, and I haven’t even spoken yet. Not my first rodeo - I have gotten my hair colored before so I know how it goes, with a consultation process sometimes what you might want achieved it not the same as what can actually be done. This was fine with me. And if he explained it kindly I would have been fine. What I’m not going to tolerate is talking over me, interrupting me, saying the same thing over and over not adding anything of worth, and insulting my intelligence. Oh he was so beyond rude, it is unbelievable. Right off the bat I felt uneasy, knowing that there would be a confrontation because for me, customer service is very important and what he provides is customer torment. When he kept interrupting me I felt so unheard and ridiculed that I eventually broke into tears. That is a HORRIBLE thing to do to a customer. He should honestly be ashamed of himself. Rude horrible man. I didn’t get any treatment done and he has kept my money. I’m going to continue to publicize my experience with this salon and get my refund from my credit card company.",1,1761875874.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Two of those remnant bottles I’m particularly fond of are [January Spirits’ amaro](https://www.januaryspirits.com/amaro) and some Altos Reposado infused with roasted pine nuts. We used them in separate drinks, but as a big fan of tequila in an espresso martini, they seemed like a no-brainer to mix together. 

The result was quite nice. The amaro’s coffee/chicory notes make it a fine substitute for the coffee liqueur we’d normally use. Its citrus notes play well with the tequila and the minty, herbal notes add a fun, complex layer on top. That’s where the acuity of my palate ends, but I’m supposing that the pine nut infusion offers something that we lose using cold brew concentrate as opposed to a freshly brewed espresso.

Regardless, the drink disappeared in the time it took to write this, so I’m a happy customer.

We have some appointments during the day and hope to explore in the afternoons/evenings — looking forward to experiencing the city!

Hoping to get some local insight on:

⸻

🍜 FOOD & THINGS TO DO

Since this is our first visit and we don’t know when we’ll get the chance to return, we’d love recommendations for:

	•	Must-eat spots (open to anything from hawker/street food to nicer restaurants/modern Indonesian cuisine)
	•	Cultural / iconic places worth visiting
	•	Nice areas to walk around, grab coffee, people-watch, and browse
	•	Neighborhoods that are fun or interesting for first-timers

We’ll mostly be in South Jakarta but happy to venture out!

⸻

🚗 TRANSPORTATION

We plan to mostly use Grab, but since we have a few daytime appointments and want to avoid timing stress, we’re considering hiring a driver for a day or two.

	•	Any reputable driver/company recommendations?

⸻

✈️  FRIDAY AM FLIGHT ADVICE

We’re flying internationally out of CGK on Friday morning and are deciding between 9:40 AM or 11:10 AM.

	•	Which departure time is less stressful with Friday morning traffic?
	•	How early would you plan to arrive at the airport? 
		(In the U.S. we usually go ~3 hours early — same here, or more/less?)

⸻

We can’t wait for this trip and would love to make the most of our visit.
Very excited & grateful for any tips. Thank you!! 🙏

They said the X-ray showed two broken bones but didn’t give me many details. One doctor said I might need surgery, then another said I might not. They put me in a cast and sent me home, told me to see a clinic on Tuesday, but even then it’s “not guaranteed” that I won’t need surgery.

I’m really freaking out. The pain has been almost nonexistent — I haven’t needed any painkillers, and there’s no discoloration — so I’m hoping it’s not severe. But I’m still terrified.

I had two trips planned: one in six weeks and another in eight. I’m a really social, active person — I walk 15k steps a day — and it feels like a part of my life just got ripped away. I live alone in a foreign country with no family here. A friend took me to the ER, but otherwise I’m on my own for daily stuff. Even grabbing a coffee is hard. I’m using my office chair to roll around my apartment.

It just feels so unfair — I wasn’t even doing anything reckless. If I’d been skiing or dancing, at least it’d make sense. Everything I read online is making me more anxious — people saying they couldn’t walk for months. I’m so scared because I don’t have anyone to care for me if recovery drags on.

I’m technically lucky — I have a remote job, financial stability, and all of December off (forced vacation I can’t cancel). So I guess the silver lining is that it happened in winter and I can rest. But honestly, I just feel deep FOMO and sadness. I’d bought my Halloween costume and was so excited to go out, and now all my plans are gone.

It’s a weird mix of fear for my health and grief for my freedom. Every time I see a post online saying “3 months and still can’t walk,” my stomach drops. I just want to heal and get my life back.

Yes, I just killed 20 mosquitoes. There are still so many floating around. The little ones are the worst ones who haven't sucked blood yet. The fat ones that were already on are sluggish and always leave a small blood stain. I have an electric mosquito device, but I haven't plugged it in yet because I don't need it. Now I've looked for it and plugged it in... only now I don't need it anymore... I'll stay awake until the sun comes up at 6 and do my 5000-7000 steps on the beach.

The dirty pussies critters. Now I always clean away the dead critters and the stains. So that Lakshmi will give me a good price next time after she sees how clean I am. I also think the rest of the room is very tidy. There are the Indians who go on vacation for 2.3 days and it's completely different. They leave the rooms like a mess.

Yesterday: The infection is getting better. I would say it is 80% healed. Now it remains to be seen what it looks like when I move back into the fan room, where there is often a power outage. I basically had the hotel to myself for the last week. She has 12 rooms here and I was the only guest.

Little anecdote: There is a trash can in front of every room on my floor. I filled mine first and then took the neighbor's. Meanwhile all three trash cans, all full, are in front of my room and the fourth one in my room is also full. But I'm moving out today anyway.

Yesterday we went out at 5:15 a.m., cleaned up the place, shaved etc. and went to the beach at 6 a.m. for a morning walk. The pedometer thing is an additional motivator, but the advertising on the app is very annoying. Shortly before 7 a.m. sat on a concrete parapet and watched the sunrise and smoked a cigarette and then went to Rock Namaste at 7 a.m. I think they open a little earlier just for me. It's normal from 8 a.m. to sit in at 7:30 a.m.

There are always the same 3.4 people there doing morning exercise at that time. And a few locals just sit there and look out to sea.

AT 7:15 a.m. I ate my masala dosa with coffee with milk. She always does this with boiling milk... so I had to order a glass of cold milk with it and always drink it and pour it over. After breakfast in the room and PC / cell phone / bedtime. (I think).. but only for a short time.. I'll be in Gokarna pretty soon. I had to go to the ATM and withdraw the money for my room rent... 40k Rp. 400€. They barely fit in my wallet.. the biggest note they have is a 5€ note, 500rp note.. and then there are 100s.

Then went to the gym. Since I met ___.. the junior boss at Paradise.. he also pumps and was somehow always very kind to me.. I also had bad alcohol crashes.. I used to drink my Cola Rum with lemon and ice. Exchanged WhatsApp...then went to the gym and just did bench presses and a bit of biceps. Then the rest of the shopping was done: 3x 180ml whiskey, 2 sticks of L&M Red, I went to 4 stores because of the cell phone case until I found one who ordered some for me.. for both cell phones. And other food stuff and stuff like that.

But then I was completely exhausted and ate idli and then masala dosa in the Pai Hotel for very cheap - this is a local restaurant and has been making the best masala dosa in all of Gokarna for years, I think.

Oh yes, I also got a strip of Pregabalin, this time from the other pharmacy in the hope that it would work better.

When I was finally exhausted at home in the AC room, I of course tested the Pregabalin 4 pieces together with a whiskey, cola and Internet / WoW. That went on for 3.4 hours. I ate the strip and drank 2 of the 3 bottles. Then a nap... and I just woke up at 6 p.m. when Peter knocks... it's a sauna outside and I should come out with him. But I freshened up, sorted myself out, showered, put a lot of things away and then met Peter on the beach, sat down, watched the sunset and babbled. The weather is perfect right now. Nice and windy and pure sunshine. And in the evening after sunset you can just walk along the beach in your swimming trunks and feel the fresh breeze of the lake. I'm never alone up and down the beach again and then we go to Rock Namaste for dinner.

Peter always wants to stay seated.. Food was good and good conversations.. especially about the Panchakarma where we are going in 2 weeks.. but I've had enough at some point.. and I don't think it's the addiction.. I then want to go home, in front of my PC or in front of my cell phone.. I also said I'm leaving now, he can stay seated at 8 p.m.

Of course I drank the last 180 at home, but I didn't touch the disgusting 90 from the tetra pack that I still had in reserve. Played WoW and raided again, which will probably no longer be possible in Uma because of the shitty Internet. Then go to bed at 10 p.m.

++ great weather

++ financially and generally positioned so that I can enjoy this

++ I'm currently making good contacts with the lkocals

It's a very isolating thing. 

My Q has embarrassed me a ton of times in front of their drinking friends, and excluded me because I don't like hanging out at the bar, doing drinking activities (which I was only included in because I would be forced to drive). I am not saying I don't also bear fault in a lot of things that have gone wrong in our relationship, I let things build up to where I explode because I cannot stand things the way they are anymore. 

After my Q wrecking one car(no DUI at that time) and another time getting a DUI and continuing to drink, I was stupid enough to stay. 

It got to a point where I dread every holiday and birthday. I have so many photos and even video of them either passed out or being verbally/emotionally abusive. 

I spent every weekend (which I worked really hard to get my schedule changed so we could ""spend time together"" and it turned into them going to the bar every weekend) taking care of the kids, house, and waiting for them to come home from the bar. 

I have talked to them about spending time with me, with our kids, not being at the bar every weekend until I am blue in the face. 

I eventually stopped asking for attention, and I set goals for myself. For me, to get myself out of the depression and anxiety that I dealt with on a weekly basis, to try and work on myself and my friendships, because I could see the end of the relationship and I wanted to feel like a whole person, not someone who was broken and alone. My goals were to get into counseling (which I did), get a garden going (I got a community garden plot), spend more time with friends (I started doing coffee with friends every Sunday), and adopt a dog. 

I adopted a shih tzu. The first night I had her at home, before she had even been here a whole day, he came home drunk (and high) and tried to take selfies with her while she was sleeping on the couch. She bite him. 

It's been 6 months now and the dog has settled in great. She loves my teens, she's super attached to me, and she even loves my Q and gets excited to see him. 

Today, I tried to talk to him about some things that have been bothering me and the dog biting him came up. I feel like he should take some personal responsibility for messing with a dog who didn't know him while drunk and I'm sure he's holding it against me that the dog bite him. I feel bad that she did it, but I am not going to get rid of her. I got her because of my personal goals, and because I know our relationship will end, and this is something that I (and my teens)wanted and we all enjoy and love the dog, we snuggle her, we take her on walks together, and when I am sad and upset about the state of my failed relationship she comes and lays on top of me and snuggles me until I feel better. 

All of that to say, I am really struggling with the end of this relationship, of not feeling like a failure, and with feeling so lonely without the person that I thought was my person.

I don't want to think this is gonna go great and then have it crash down on me as I have 0 experience in this. I'm also super worried about if we don't connect well in-person and I have to turn him down after?? ""Let's be friends"" or maybe just a solid ""thanks but no?""

1oki5c1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1oki5c1/my_22f_close_friend_21m_is_affectionate_but/,"My (22F) close friend (21M) is affectionate but inconsistent, does he like me or am I imagining it? TLDR at the bottom.","For context, I (22F) met this guy (21M) through a game with voice chat roughly 3-4 months ago, and at first we were just being very casual and ended up becoming part of the same friend group. But, then it got a bit complicated. 

We started getting closer after some drama with my then on-and-off boyfriend, now ex, whom I'd been having trouble with for quite some time. My ex got really insecure and accused this friend of trying to “steal me,” even though nothing was going on. It was messy, but during that time, me and this male friend kept talking as friends and grew closer due to the drama. He was supportive, funny, and easy to be around and kept my mind off the downfall of a very chaotic relationship. Eventually, I ended my relationship in part because of my ex’s jealousy. I do feel the need to preface that back then, I genuinely saw this friend as just a new online friend, nothing more.

  
Since then, though, we’ve gotten a lot closer. We tease each other constantly, talk for hours, and have stayed up all night together more than I can count. Our dynamic is a bit weird, we have this very playful relationship where we ""pretend-fight"" and get on each others nerves constantly, which I do enjoy but it does make it difficult to tell exactly where we stand sometimes. The banter is fun, but lately it’s felt like there’s something more under the surface.

When he drinks, he gets soft and affectionate. He’ll say my name over and over, and repeatedly call the only other girl in our friend group my name by mistake. Everyone jokes about it, playfully saying stuff as if I'm always on his mind, but it makes me wonder a bit. And when he struggles to find the correct words whilst drunk he'll always ask me to help him as if I'd be able to read his mind. 

There's also an instance where, when he was drunk, he said I'm secretly his favourite in our group and asked me to sleep-call with him, which I did end up doing. The next day when he woke up we spent the entire day talking and said we should keep the sleep-call secret, yet he ended up getting drunk that following night and out of nowhere repeatedly revealed it to our friends and said I was the one who wanted to keep it secret.

  
A few weeks later, I went to visit him in his city which was our first time ever actually meeting up. I met his dad, we went out for coffee and dinner, and it honestly felt so natural. He's joked that the next time I should stay the night in his bed with him even though it's very small and said something like “we’d fit somehow.” 

Quite some time later, we planned the first group meet-up for everyone within our friend group. He playfully refused to take the train and wanted me to pick him up and drive him there, and we ended up sharing a hotel room and bed. He can be physically affectionate sometimes, and I can’t always tell if it’s just friendly or something more. That night for example, he put his hand in my jacket pocket to warm it when we were out with the rest of our friends, and when going to bed he said I could “hold him if I wanted to spoon"" although I genuinely couldn't tell if he was joking or not, because directly before saying that and getting in bed he'd joked about sleeping naked. During the night, he occasionally shifted close to me, with his arm brushing against me and sometimes close enough that he was fully on my side of the bed and almost holding me.

But, the most confusing thing for me is what happened the next morning. He invited the only other girl from our group, that I mentioned before, into our room and cuddled with her right next to me. At one point he reached across her, brushed my shoulder, and played with my bra strap whilst joking around. Then, out of nowhere, he lightly put his hand near my neck and asked why I wasn’t joining them and cuddling. It wasn’t aggressive or anything, I wasn’t sure how to read it and didn’t quite know what to do in the moment as I don't really even get along with this girl for unrelated reasons.  
Afterward, he went back to joking like nothing happened and even called me his “best friend” later that day. Since then, he’s been really inconsistent, like one moment he's being warm and flirty, and the next he feels very distant. He tells people about our late-night calls and that we’ve “fallen asleep on the phone together” for no reason, but then spends most of his time gaming or chatting with that other girl instead and will very rarely reach out to me. (Though I do think its somewhat unfair to judge him for not reaching out, because I don't reach out much either at this point, due to not knowing how to handle this whole situation). But he'll also make playful comments regarding this other girl and another guy in our friend group, because she's supposedly into that guy.

The thing is, I actually find myself liking him now. I don't know why, but it's to the point where it's more than I'd like to admit. I can see myself falling for him, but I can’t tell if he feels the same or if this is just how he is with people he’s close to. Part of me wonders if he’s just playing around, but then he does things that make me think he genuinely cares. I also feel insecure sometimes because I’m plus-size and not conventionally attractive compared to him.

We have another trip planned, with another guy who's part of our friend group and that guy's girlfriend. At a quite romantic destination which adds to my confusion. He's joked about it being a double date to our other male friend who's going on the trip. The plan is to share a hotel room again. I don’t want to make things weird or ruin the friendship, but I also don’t want to keep feeling this uncertain and hurt. I don’t think he’s a bad guy, I just think we've both somewhat blurred the lines between friendship and something more without meaning to. I care about him and want to understand where we stand so I don’t keep overthinking everything. Like, I can't tell if he's just being flirty for fun? Do I talk to him about it? Start pulling back to protect myself?

  
**TL;DR**: I (22F) met a guy (21M) through a game a few months ago and we became close friends. We have a playful, sometimes flirty dynamic, share late-night calls, and have stayed in the same hotel room. He can be affectionate but inconsistent, and recently included another girl in ways that confused me. I like him, but I don’t know if he feels the same or if I’m misreading things. We have another trip planned with a hotel stay at a romantic location, and I’m unsure whether to talk to him about it or pull back to protect myself.",0,1761875201.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False

1oki2qt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1oki2qt/when_does_it_get_better/,When does it get better?,"Got my heartbroken by a guy I thought I would spend the rest of my life with. I wanted him to improve and succeed but his mental health was not allowing him. We both live in different countries 600kms away from each other so long distance didn’t help either.

We started fighting about a lot of useless things and slowly getting frustrated with each other. When we started dating, he was such a passionate boy, so motivated and with such a strong friend circle however over the year he became more secluded and frustrating. Everything i did for my personal life felt like neglect or an attack to him.

I asked him if we can breakup and figure things out in the meantime. I told him if he was able to secure a job or figure out a way to remove the long distance, we can get back together.

He eventually understood my perspective and why i need space. However, we still kept in touch and texted everyday and kept calling each other. 

He then met this girl as a friend. They started off as friends, went to coffees and shopping. Then eventually in their offline conversations started flirting and realised their chemistry.

Oblivious to this in another country, I could feel him change a little with me as well. He wasn’t interested in reaching out. His texts became less frequent however I was going through a really tough time at work so I didnt focus too much.

We had plans that he would visit me for his birthday. When he visited me he told me it was his best birthday. He did everything he would have wished to do. We had plans of meeting in two weeks as I wanted to spend some time with him and also had a lot of spare annual leaves from work. I asked him if my initial one week trip could be two weeks cuz i would spend more time there. He said Ofcourse, i want you to spend more time. So he extended my trip.

When i visited him, he kept telling me how much he wanted to marry me. How he wanted to be a better man for me and what not. One night when he was sleeping i read some of his conversations with this friend he told me about. These conversations were borderline sexual. Him telling her how he would show her a good time and how much he wanted to kiss her. He said he just wanted one movie night with her for everything.

In the same chat a few weeks ago, he said how much i meant to him and how much he wanted to work to make sure we could be together. However, that girl kept convincing him that our relationship had nothing salvageable so he should move on. She wants something serious with him and he kept saying i just want something casual, no strings. In the same chats he told her how he had the worst birthday of his life this year and didnt even get birthday sex.

When i initially briefly read the chats i was okay with it as he told me he only texted her. I understood i had asked for a break so he’s not wrong to texting other people. However when i read them in detail, these conversations were happening while i slept next to him when we were meeting. Same person who asked me to marry him went to the loo and texted her how much he missed her. They used to have late night calls and she would sleep on them as well. She would often comfort him by saying,”so what? Its not like you are cheating.”

I then decided to call an end to this but he begged and pleaded me to hear him out that he was only lying to her. He didn’t mean any of this. He was just trying to fill a void. I am happy to believe that he didnt mean any of this and he just lied to her so he could get validation. However, i do think that he made a choice to text her and he didnt lack self control. Had he told me in the first place he liked someone, it wouldnt get this far.

I am devastated that my 4 year old relationship ended this way. I had invested a lot of money, emotions and all my heart in it. I think it stings a bit more cuz it was my first relationship and i don’t think this person was always this way. However, i think its fine. If theres someone he prefers that i would rather let him go. However, my heart still loves him.

This was the first boy i ever loved. I am not able to eat, sleep or look after myself. My self esteem is taking a big hit. I am trying to go to work so i have to pretend to be put together so it hopefully tricks my brain. When i leave my office, i am about to crumble because thats when i called him after work. Every night when i go to sleep i think i would probably never be someone’s first preference in life.

I know it will hurt for a while. I feel i will be able to forgive them in a few months. I really enjoyed my relationship and I’m really happy to learn that i had so much love to give and grieve. But, every night in my head i keep thinking about how he must be already texting her and probably is in her bed. They both must be laughing about how stupid i am.

I have a friend that I’ve known for about 30 years and have lived in the same city for most of that time, except when she’s spent a few years abroad. I care a lot about her, but we communicate very differently. She tends to keep things private, while I’m more open. She usually tells me big things after they happen, and while I know I’m not entitled to her personal information, it can still hurt sometimes.

Over the last year, our friendship has felt more distant. For example, earlier this year I had to put my cat down. I asked if I could see her afterward because I didn’t want to be alone, and she said she was busy at work and getting ready for a vacation. I understood, but she didn’t even text me the day it happened. It really stung, especially after so many years of friendship. I started to step back a bit at this point but we text almost every day.

Two weeks ago, we got coffee. Out of nowhere, she told me that she’s moving across the country to a new city. Not only that, but she’s been planning it for months and already started a new job three months ago that she never mentioned. The job and the move aren’t connected - she can work remotely - but she wants “a fresh start.” She’s done this “new start” thing before in other countries and it has not worked out. Each time, I’ve supported her through her disappointment, but I just feel too drained to do that again. She has done very little research on this new city, hasn’t ever been, signed a lease without even seeing the neighbourhood that her place will be in, and feels that this new city will fix her problems.

Since our last conversation, she’s been texting me constant updates about selling her things, cleaning out her apartment, and how excited she is to leave. Today, I set a boundary. I finally told her that I’m happy for her but it’s been hard for me emotionally and I need to step back from the move updates because I’m grieving the fact that my oldest friend is leaving and that we aren’t as close as I’d thought. I said that I felt hurt that I wasn’t even told about this move until very recently. She got angry, called me clingy, and said I wasn’t a true friend for not being happy for her.

Now I’m questioning myself. Am I being overdramatic by grieving the friendship I thought I had? I don’t think that it has existed for a while. I know she has every right to move and live her life, but I feel blindsided and sad that someone I’ve known for 30 years didn’t tell me about a huge life change until two weeks before leaving.

1okhu8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1okhu8n/urdu_class_2_pdf_based_on_single_national/,Urdu Class 2 PDF Based on Single National Curriculum - Punjab Textbook Board,"Hello fellow bookworms and curious minds!

I've been meaning to share my thoughts on a book that truly stuck with me, and I figured this subreddit would appreciate a good ol' chat about it. Whether you're diving into a gripping novel or simply looking for new material to engage your mind, perhaps even something educational like the [Urdu Class 2 PDF Based on Single National Curriculum - Punjab Textbook Board](https://pdfhive.com/urdu-class-2-pdf-based-on-single-national-curriculum-पंजाब-टेक्स्टबुक-बोर्ड/) to learn something new, the world of reading is vast and wonderful. Today, I want to talk about ""The Echoing Silence,"" a recent read that blended psychological thriller with a whisper of fantasy in a really intriguing way.

This book tells the story of Elara, a woman who retreats to a remote, windswept village after a deeply unsettling personal tragedy. She's looking for peace, for quiet, but what she finds instead is a chilling folklore woven into the very fabric of the community. As her own grip on reality starts to waver, Elara must decipher if the whispers she hears are echoes of her past trauma, or if something far older and more sinister lurks in the shadows of the silent, isolated town. It's a journey into the mind's darkest corners, wrapped in a genuinely unsettling atmosphere.

What I genuinely appreciated about ""The Echoing Silence"" was its atmosphere. The author painted such vivid pictures of the isolated village, making it feel like a character itself. Every creaking floorboard, every gust of wind, added to the pervasive sense of dread. Elara, our protagonist, was incredibly well-drawn. Her emotional journey felt authentic and raw, making her struggles with her past and the unfolding mysteries deeply compelling. The writing style was just beautiful, simple yet evocative, pulling me along without ever feeling rushed. The pacing was a slow burn, which I adore in psychological thrillers, allowing the tension to build naturally until I was practically holding my breath.

Now, no book is perfect for everyone, and I did have a tiny quibble. While the ending was certainly impactful and thought-provoking, I felt a particular secondary character's arc could have been a bit more fleshed out. Their motivations felt a touch underdeveloped compared to the rich tapestry woven around Elara and the village. But honestly, it's a minor point in an otherwise fantastic read.

So, would I recommend ""The Echoing Silence""? A resounding yes! This book is perfect for those who enjoy psychological thrillers that prioritize mood and character over jump scares. If you appreciate a slow-burn narrative, a touch of the eerie, and stories where the line between reality and the supernatural is deliciously blurred, then you absolutely need to pick this one up. It also has a subtle fantasy element that integrates really smoothly without overpowering the psychological aspect.

For those of you who might be new to reading, or perhaps looking to get back into it, please don't feel intimidated! Reading should be a joy, not a chore. Here are a few simple tips to get you started:

1.  **Start Small:** Don't feel like you need to tackle a huge epic right away. Pick up a novella, a short story collection, or even a book with larger print and fewer pages. The goal is to build the habit.
2.  **Read What You Love:** Forget what you ""should"" be reading. If a fantasy novel about dragons sounds more fun than a classic, go for the dragons! If you're into true crime, dive into that. The key is enjoyment. And remember, reading can be anything from a gripping novel to educational material like the [Urdu Class 2 PDF Based on Single National Curriculum - Punjab Textbook Board](https://pdfhive.com/urdu-class-2-pdf-based-on-single-national-curriculum-पंजाब-टेक्स्टबुक-बोर्ड/) if you're looking to learn something new.
3.  **Set Aside Time:** Even 10-15 minutes a day can make a huge difference. Before bed, during your commute, or with your morning coffee. Make it a ritual.
4.  **Don't Be Afraid to Quit:** If a book isn't grabbing you, put it down! Life's too short to force yourself through a book you're not enjoying. There are countless others waiting for you.
5.  **Join a Community:** Talking about books, like we're doing here on Reddit, can make the experience even richer. Share what you're reading, get recommendations, and just connect with others who love books.

Reading is an incredible way to explore new worlds, understand different perspectives, and simply relax. No matter what you choose to pick up, whether it's a thrilling page-turner or a helpful resource like the [Urdu Class 2 PDF Based on Single National Curriculum - Punjab Textbook Board](https://pdfhive.com/urdu-class-2-pdf-based-on-single-national-curriculum-पंजाब-टेक्स्टबुक-बोर्ड/), the journey itself is a reward. So go ahead, find a cozy spot, and let a story take you away.

Happy reading, everyone!",1,1761874347.0,pdfhive,0,1.0,False
1okht76,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moving2SanDiego/comments/1okht76/neighborhood_help/,Neighborhood help,"Hi everyone! 

I’m planning to relocate to the San Diego area in early 2026 and would love some honest input from locals. I’ll be visiting next week and want to spend a day exploring different neighborhoods to get a feel for where I should start my apartment search.

I’m a single 35-year-old woman with a dog, currently living in NYC. The anxiety that comes with public transit and the general unpleasantness of simple errands has worn me down. Despite having access to everything imaginable — and endless people — I’ve found it becoming increasingly overwhelming & difficult to build a real sense of community here. It was fun and exciting when it was new, but after 10 years, I’m ready for something calmer, sunnier, and friendlier — but still with great restaurants, live music, and easy airport access since I travel often.

What I’m looking for:
- Safe, quiet neighborhood that still feels alive — people biking or walking dogs, kids playing, friendly neighbors.
- Within ~30 minutes of downtown for concerts, restaurants, etc.
- Dog-friendly, car-friendly, community-oriented, access to farmers markets
- Walkable to a park and a short drive to coffee, groceries, and Target, etc.
- Access to hiking or nature within 30–45 minutes for weekends.
- Hoping to meet other single professionals in their 30s.
- I'll be renting — budget around $3,500/month for a 1–2 BR.

Would love your thoughts on which areas fit what I'm looking for. I’m planning to spend my time next week like I would on a normal weekend — but if there's anything specific I should check out I’d love any recommendations. Last note, I've been to San Diego a bunch of times but only as a tourist and the most recent time was in 2021, so hoping to use this trip as an opportunity to immerse myself as a local.  

Thanks so much!",2,1761874265.0,Moving2SanDiego,9,0.75,False

1okhsta,https://www.reddit.com/r/CuriousAF/comments/1okhsta/social_skills_arent_natural_theyre_built_and/,Social skills aren’t natural — they’re built (and here’s how to master them faster),"Let’s talk about something that most people secretly struggle with, but rarely admit: social skills. Everyone assumes they’re just supposed to “have them” by a certain age. Be charismatic, funny, confident, smooth in a group, good at reading a room. But in reality? Most people are walking around with serious social anxiety or feeling like they never got the memo. Blame it on algorithm-fed social media personalities preaching “just be confident” or influencers turning social fluency into aesthetic performance. None of it’s helpful. And honestly, a lot of it is just plain wrong.

What I’ve noticed, especially among smart, self-aware folks, is that the biggest myth we’ve internalized is this: social skills are *natural*. You either got it or you don’t. But that’s not true. Social fluency is a skill, not a trait. It can be trained and optimized like fitness, creativity, or memory. The good news? There are actually research-backed ways to learn it that don’t involve selling your soul to performativity or burying your personality.

Here’s how to build real, authentic social fluency — not fake self-promo scripts or manipulative ""charm hacks"". Just actual tools to help you connect better, read people accurately, and stop overthinking everything.

- **Social skills come from exposure, not talent**  
  You’re not “bad at socializing” — you’re underexposed. According to Dr. Ty Tashiro (author of *Awkward*), 1 in 5 adults report being chronically socially anxious, and many of them simply had less social learning opportunities growing up. It’s not a defect. It’s a delay. Just like language exposure, connection fluency builds from repeated authentic interaction, not forced small talk in uncomfortable settings.

- **Practice micro-interactions daily**  
  Behavioral scientist Vanessa Van Edwards, in her book *Cues*, explains that social confidence builds most effectively in low-stakes environments — think 15-second exchanges at a coffee shop or complimenting someone’s dog at the park. These low-pressure reps reduce nervous system stress and build what she calls “charisma endurance”. Think gym reps. But for your extroverted muscle.

- **Learn body language from the pros**  
  Social fluency is 80% nonverbal. Want to decode the room faster? Watch YouTube channels like *Charisma on Command* or *The Behavioral Arts* to sharpen your ability to read microexpressions, tone, and congruency. FBI body language expert Joe Navarro’s book *What Every BODY is Saying* is another goldmine. It’s wild how much you can learn just from the angle of someone’s feet.

- **Don’t chase confidence, chase context**  
  Harvard psychologist Dr. Amy Cuddy shared that confidence is not a personality trait, it’s situational familiarity. If you keep throwing yourself into chaotic social settings without understanding the dynamics, you’re not “building bravery” — you’re overwhelming your nervous system. Instead, pick one or two environments you can become familiar with (e.g. the same social meetup, or niche community) and commit to showing up consistently. Predictability is security.

- **Ditch performance mode for curiosity mode**  
  One of the most life-changing shifts comes from *The Like Switch* by former FBI agent Jack Schafer. People don’t like you because you say impressive things. They like you because they feel *seen*. Replace “how do I impress them?” with “What makes this person interesting?” Then ask open-ended questions. Listen for emotion, not just facts. Social fluency is basically well-trained curiosity.

- **Stop trying to be liked. Be easy to be around.**  
  Being likable is about emotional reliability, not perfection. Neuroscience researcher Dr. Andrew Huberman explains that humans unconsciously seek out others who regulate their nervous system. If you speak calmly, smile genuinely, and hold stable eye contact, people will *feel* safe with you. Even if you stumble over your words. Even if you’re awkward for 30 seconds. Safety > slickness.

- **Don’t skip emotional attunement training**  
  Social fluency is emotional literacy in motion. One of the most underrated skills is being able to sense how someone feels even when they don’t say it. The book *Nonviolent Communication* by Marshall Rosenberg is basically emotional jiu-jitsu. It teaches you to recognize needs behind words and emotions behind silence. Read it once. Your interactions will never be the same.

Here are some tools to keep building:

- **Book: *The Charisma Myth* by Olivia Fox Cabane**  
  This bestseller blends behavioral science and confidence psychology to show that charisma isn’t innate — it’s made of presence, power, and warmth. Cabane backed it with real case studies, from CEOs to public speakers. Read it twice, let it sink in. This is the best science-backed guide to being likable without faking it. Insanely good read.

- **Book: *The Defining Decade* by Dr. Meg Jay**  
  Especially for people in their 20s and 30s, this book gives you a deep dive into how identity, relationships, and social capital shape your future. Dr. Jay is a clinical psychologist and her writing is super sharp. It’ll make you rethink how you’re spending your “social time”. This book will make you question everything you assumed about personality and adulthood.

- **Podcast: Hidden Brain**  
  Hosted by Shankar Vedantam, this podcast blends psychology with storytelling. Episodes like “The Secret Life of Secrets” and “The Power of Apologies” are filled with social and emotional intelligence gems. Easy to listen to. Makes you smarter and more socially aware in the process.

- **App: Finch**  
  This self-care and goal tracking app helps build daily routines around emotional regulation. You can use it to track your social goals too — like initiating one small talk conversation a day. Or reflecting on a moment when you felt seen. Super helpful if you’re trying to quantify progress without being self-critical.

- **BeFreed**  
  This AI-powered learning app is perfect if you want to get smarter about human connection but don’t have hours to read. It has massive libraries of books and expert talks about social intelligence, confidence psychology, relationship dynamics, and behavioral science. Plus it creates a custom podcast feed based on your goals — like “build emotional intelligence”, “become more charismatic”, or “overcome social anxiety”. You can pick your host’s voice style (mine is a smoky, sarcastic narrator who sounds like they’ve seen some things), and even select the length of each session — 10, 20, or 40 minutes. Best feature? It actually learns from what you listen to and builds an adaptive learning roadmap just like a real coach. All the books I mentioned above are on there too. If you’re serious about getting 1% better every day, this is the easiest way to make learning a habit.

No one was born with perfect people skills. Your favorite charismatic people? They studied the game. If you train for it, you’ll build it. Promise.",1,1761874235.0,CuriousAF,0,1.0,False

1okhrpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1okhrpn/my_air_conditioner_is_acting_weird/,My air conditioner is acting weird,"Not as in it will turn off and on, or that it’ll drip. No I mean my air conditioning unit is following me around. It started a few months ago. I woke up hot as hell so I went to see if my air conditioner box broke or turned off but to my surprise it was missing. I looked on the front yard to see if it fell but it wasn’t there. “Fucking crackheads” I thought in annoyance. I picked up my phone and decided to order a new AC box while eating some cereal. When I got to the kitchen I found it.

My Air Conditioner had grown legs overnight. It was walking in circles on long Barbie doll like legs that elevated the air conditioner to the height of a German Shepherd. It was blowing cold air at me despite the power cord dragging behind it like a tail. In spite of being weird looking I was still freaking out since my Air conditioner was walking. I screamed and tripped on god knows what and was cornered with my back to the wall. “OH FUUUCK NOOOOOO!” I screamed as my ungodly household appliance jogged towards me. I threw my arms up and braced for a painfully over the top B horror movie death with buckets of fake blood and shitty anatomy. 

After an hour of waiting I shivered and looked up. My AC was standing next to me still blowing cold air not doing anything. I stood up and started backing away slowly. The air conditioner took a few steps toward me in return. I walked towards it, it didn’t react. I pushed it back slowly with my foot but it just walked back over when I pulled my foot back. I kicked its legs out from under it and in response the creature kicked itself to its gross feet like a fighter in an old Kung fu movie. I was already fed up with this bullshit. So I took my crowbar that I keep next to my fridge and smashed my Air Conditioner until it was a mess on the floor. When I was done I looked at my watch. “OH SHIT I’M LATE FOR WORK” I screamed out loud before rushing to get ready. 

When I got in my car the air conditioning was waiting on the passenger seat keeping my seat cold. “Shitballs” I said irritably to no one in particular. As weird as this was I had shit to do today so I got in the cold car and started to drive occasionally shooting a bombastic side eye at the creature beside me. “Can you at least buckle up? There’s a cop up ahead”. It didn’t respond. 


It’s been like this for months and I’m starting to get annoyed. It’s winter where I am so I need to bundle myself up twice as much as what I normally would. If I want to start the day with a nice cup of hot coffee or end the day with a nice warm bowl of chunky soup then I need to do it quickly since it’ll get cold quick now. I had a cold the other day and I needed to bundle up with at least 8 blankets to keep warm. I do work working for a living and it’s super frustrating when the glue drys twice as quick and there’s sawdust blowing everywhere.

I can’t tell anyone about it either. No matter who I tell their response is always the same. They look at the Air conditioner box and back to me with a frog-like expression and say “huh cool.” And walk away saying nothing else about it. Aside from taking a crowbar to it I’ve tried throwing it out the window, chucking it in the oven, even blowing it up with C4 didn’t do Jack-shit. I’m at a lose of what to do, I just want to be warm again but no matter what I do my air conditioning box won’t stop acting weird",1,1761874151.0,stories,0,1.0,False
1okhrmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1okhrmr/necrolepsy_part_one/,Necrolepsy - Part One,"*Hey all. First time writing anything for an audience so hope you like it. Feel free to put any constructive criticisms in the comments.* 

  
It started out small. That’s what makes it worse. If it had been sudden—a full-on blackout, a seizure, waking up in the back of an ambulance—maybe I’d have understood sooner. But it came on slowly, like rust. At first it was just fatigue; the kind you can’t shrug off with coffee and cheap optimism. But that was just the start.

I’d been working long hours. The office was going through a restructuring—which is corporate-speak for *“we’re firing half of you but making the rest pretend it’s a promotion.”* I acted like that promotion was the only thing keeping me from the breadline. Because in my mind it was. There was no way I was going back to flipping burgers at McDonald’s for minimum wage, living at home with a molly coddling mother—not with a degree under my belt and a mountain of debt behind it.

This job had taken the better part of a decade to get where I was, and I wasn’t about to lose it. Halfway through this industrial Hunger Games, I had been putting in twelve-hour days, chasing deadlines and KPIs that kept shifting just far enough to stay out of reach. I figured that’s why my co-workers started saying I looked “zoned out.” and “like death warmed up”. After a while the fatigue turned to micro-sleeps: short periods where your brain involuntarily shuts down. Apparently, I’d stop mid-sentence sometimes, eyes open but vacant, like I was buffering. 

At first the micro-sleeps were an annoyance more than anything. An unwanted interruption when they happened at work. They’d only last a blink to me, but I’d miss things—details in meetings, messages from my boss. He started calling me “NPC,” because of this and unfortunately, the nickname stuck. After that, I’d be greeted every day with a chorus of dull jokes about my “dialogue tree.” He laughed and the office sycophants echoed. I did too. Better to own the joke than try to rebuke it, take the teeth out of it. Like ever bad boss though, he kept the joke going far too long and it stopped being funny, but he never noticed, just kept grinning like an idiot. How that prick managed to stay so chipper all the time made my hair itch. Everyone acted like they were burning the wick at both ends so why did I seem to be the only one who looked burnt out? 

By Friday night every week I was completely wrecked. I’d parrot the “Saturday Satan; Sunday Saint” crew boasting plans of clubs, bars or something adventurous followed by a chill day with a good book, but in truth my weekends were a blur of bedsheets, bad dreams and my Mom’s Sunday morning ritual phone call. Every Sunday since I moved out of home she called. 8am on the dot before she and Dad headed off to Church. I never had much to say, there was only so many times you could complain about your crappy boss and feeling like you were half in the grave at 30. She’d just get all worried about me anyway if I did keep repeating myself. That was the last thing I needed while things were so stressful at work. Mom was clingy like that. I once let slip I had the flu and she drove all the way into the city with a pot of chicken soup and proceeded to smother me for a week. I know she meant well but I think it was more to make herself feel better. She always was anxious about me living where she couldn’t keep a close eye. Especially after how I’d come in to her life.

After a while the coffee seemed to loose its punch no matter how many shots I asked for at the cafe. The energy drinks turned sour in my mouth and only left me feeling more decrepit than usual. I started doing strange things during these micro-sleeps. I remember sitting at my desk, sandpaper eyes glues to a spreadsheet for the fourth consecutive hour. I’d blink then find the cursor hovering over a group email that read complete nonsense:

“The sky is wrong here.”

Thankfully, I deleted it before it went anywhere.

Not long after that, I started dreaming at work. They started as flashes during the micro-sleeps. Barely noticeable. Like the first glimpses of Tyler Durden before his reveal in Fight Club. But as time went on they lasted longer, left me feeling cold and hollow each time I snapped out of it.

At first, I ignored them. Then they started repeating.

A black sea.  A cracked church bell.  A tree.  A naked woman.  A black spiral.

Still, I told myself it was stress. This industry was not for the weak. It took guts and a kind of dogged determination to truly make it. I didn't just want to keep my job, I wanted my boss's job. These damn daydreams or whatever they were were screwing that up for me. I’d resolved myself a long time ago to not end up with a blue collar, living pay check to pay check like my folks had. I’d watched my Dad work three jobs just to keep food on the table and pay my medical bills. Seen my mother worry herself old before her years raising me. I wouldn’t let that same thing happen to me. I had to have enough behind me to make sure of it. My job was the only way that was going to happen. 

One night around 9:30, I was microwaving dinner—one of those sad bachelor meals that looks gourmet on the box but turns into brown sludge when you nuke it. The timer beeped. I blinked. Next thing I knew, the food was cold and congealed. The clock on the microwave said 1:37 a.m. I’d lost nearly three hours standing there. I didn’t remember dreaming, but I smelled something foul—like rot. I blamed the dinner.

The next episode happened at work while I was in the bathroom. I was watching a finance bro podcast while doing my business, blinked, saw the usual flash of something and then realized my legs were completely numb. My phone was dead and the office lights were off. I’d been sitting there for five hours. Thankfully everyone else had already left for the day so I didn't have that embarrassment to deal with. 

I doubled the dosage of my sleeping tablets and managed two more weeks without an incident.

Then came the long weekend. My mother insisted I come down to stay with her and Dad—“Get some sunshine, fresh air, and a proper meal.” I tried to argue I was too busy, but she threatened to come up to my place instead so I relented. 

I packed up early Saturday morning and hit the highway around 9 a.m. The radio had just finished the with its news broadcast and switched back to the Top 100 countdown. The sun was warm through the window.

BANG!  The car must’ve hit a pothole or something because my stomach dropped, and my head smacked against the window. I snapped awake.

I wasn’t on the highway anymore.

The four-lane asphalt had become a dirt backroad, hemmed in by skeletal trees and thick fog. My stomach turned over as I imagined a trail of destruction behind me—cars rammed off the road, people hurt or worse—while I drove on, eyes closed, a mannequin at the wheel. God, I hoped I hadn’t killed anyone.

The car was fine, but that didn’t mean anything. I’d seen enough dashcam videos to know how often the guilty got off without a scratch.

Enough speculation. I checked my watch. 3 a.m.

The shock hit me like a brick. I’d left home at 9 a.m. Even with traffic I should have been at my parents house by lunch. I’d been driving—*or something*—for eighteen hours.  
  
A familiar itch crept in to my hairline.

I searched the console for my phone. Gone. Checked the glovebox, the floor, the seats. Nothing. My chest tightened the itch more intense, begging to be scratched. I tore through every pocket I had. Still nothing.

“This is crazy,” I muttered. I always left it on charge in the console while driving.

Had I left it at home? No—I’d texted Mom from the driveway.

I searched for nearly an hour before giving up. My scalp was screaming at me.  
 “Just fucking great.”

I sat in the driver’s seat, breathing slow, trying not to spiral. I gave in and ran my fingers through my hair, finding a bump in the skin. I picked until my nails came away bloody. It helped. Not much, but enough to think.

I was alone. In the dark. On a road I didn’t recognize. And I had somehow lost eighteen hours.

It wasn’t until I’d completely picked the skin off that spot I finally felt calm. I rolled a tiny bloody lump between my fingers while I went over the facts. I must have scratched the head off a mole or something. 

**One:** I wasn’t near my parent’s place. The trees proved that. The woods around the lake where they lived were a mix of pine and oak. These were…wrong. Ash-grey trunks with bald wispy limbs, twisted together into a canopy that looked like spiderwebs. With the fog thick below, my view out the windscreen looked like a black-and-white horror movie—or that part in a cartoon where the rabbit goes into the bad part of the forest.

**Two:** The gas gauge read just under half a tank. Relief flickered at that. I shouldn’t be that far away then if I’d only used half a tank. 

A sharp pain in my scalp broke my concentration. I had unknowingly been scratching again. I pulled my hand away and forced a deep breath. “You're OK” I told myself. Glancing back at the fuel gauge in an effort to reassure my wandering mind. I checked my watch again. It was past four now. The sun should rise soon, maybe burn off the fog. I decided to wait. Better to backtrack in daylight. Hopefully find the Highway again or at least a town so I could figure out just where I was.

*Eighteen hours. Jesus.* This was the worse one yet.

Eventually, the sun did rise, though not from the direction I expected which only made me feel even more turned around. After hours of cautious driving in the opposite direction from last night, I found pavement again but it was not the highway I was hoping for. When the gauge dipped near empty, I spotted salvation: a gas station.

I pulled up feeling exhausted yet hopeful and went straight for the clerk inside. He was a wiry man in his fifties perched atop a stool inside the confines of a 6 foot long plexiglass box that made up the front counter. He looked like the Muppets’ bandleader made flesh and his matching drawl dragged through every syllable.

“Back so soon?” he said. “Thought you was done with this place.”

I stalled a moment. “You know me?”

“Sure. You was in here last night.”

“I was? Well… I guess that’s good.”

“You’re lookin’ a mite better than you were then.”

“Oh?”

“Yeah. You was pale as a sheet, talkin’ to yourself ‘bout somethin’ or other. Couldn’t make out the words.”

Scratch.Scratch. Scratch.

“Sorry, I don’t remember any of that. Listen—I’ve gotten myself turned around. Can you tell me where I am?”

The clerk gave me a long look, stroking one side of his mustache.

“Son, it ain’t for me to judge,” he said slowly, “but I think you best lay off whatever you been smokin’ or drinkin’.”

“I’m not on drugs. I… I don’t know what happened. I blacked out.”

Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.

“Uh-huh. Like I said.”

“No, you don’t get it,” I snapped. “I think I was *asleep.*”

He frowned. “Sure was vertical for a feller sleepin’.”  
  
Scratch. Scratch. 

The coppery smell of blood hit my nostrils. I found a new spot in my scalp to pick.

“You never heard of sleepwalking?”

“Sure. My Aunt Ginny’s a sleepwalker.”

“Right. So last night, I think I was sleepwalking or something when I came in here.”

He smirked. “Was that before or after you bought the gas?”

“I’m serious.”

“Okay, feller. Whatever you say. Just—when Aunt Ginny went walkin’, she never had the sense to count out paper and change like you did. I s’pose you came back for your phone?”

“My phone? You have it?”

“Yeah. You gave it to me.”

“I did?”

“Yep. Came in here mumblin’ to yourself as I said, bought gas, handed me this phone and said, *‘I won’t need it where I’m going.’* Then you just walked out.”

He lifted it from behind the counter and waved it in the air. “Now you tell me that sound like someone sleepin’, or someone high as a kite?”

I was too exhausted to argue. My fingers ached from scratching so hard. My hairline burned. “Can I have it back, please?”

“Sure thing.” He said as he slid it under the plexi-glass barrier.

I unlocked it , oblivious to the notifications for a slew of missed calls and unread text messages and immediately opened the GPS app. The signal was weak, but it eventually pinged.

“Holy shit,” I whispered.

“Yeah, I figured you was a long way from home when I saw them plates,” the clerk chuckled.

“This can’t be happening,” I said, voice cracking.

The GPS said I was over two thousand miles from home. Something yielded beneath a fingernail and I felt my skin split open on the back of my head. I winced and drew my hand away finally, crimson clinging to the index finger up to the first knuckle.

“Anything else, bud?” the clerk asked.

I hesitated. “Yeah. Full tank of gas… and the strongest pot of coffee you can make.”

I knew the coffee wouldn’t really help but I just needed something in that moment to make me feel somewhat normal. I handed over my cash, and he flipped a switch for the pump outside. I filled the tank, the whole time my mind racing over the new information I had received. It didn’t make sense. My head ached. Both behind my eyes from stress and atop my scalp where I new several fresh sores were from my anxious picking. I returned inside the storefront to fetch the coffee. The clerk slid it across the counter and I threw it back like I was taking shots at the bar. It burned the roof of my mouth but I didn’t care. I made him pour another for the road. While he decanted the last drops into my cup I looked about impatiently, glancing over the assorted candy bars, beef jerky and sunglasses festooning the counter. Stuck to the plexi-glass amidst the advertisements for lottery tickets, local missing cats and lawn mowers for sale was a pin-up calendar—half-naked girls next to hot rods kind of thing. But my eyes were not drawn to the sultry models or classic cars. I felt a sharp tug at my scalp, the skin feeling like it was being pulled in opposite directions. My hands were tight fists by this point.

“Is this some kind of joke?” I asked.

He frowned. “Huh?”

I pointed at the calendar where a series of red marker slashes checked off each passing day. “The date!.”

He looked closer, unbothered. “Oh….Happy Monday, I guess.”

1okhmoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1okhmoc/the_beast_in_the_pines_part_1/,"The Beast In The Pines, Part 1","My mom and dad were born and raised in Clarence, an old small town in the countryside between the midlands and the coast. A flat woodland, lush from its snaking rivers and creeks. Its swamps bled into the marshes and down through the deltas into the salty southern coast that was a little over an hour away. Clarence was the little nothing-town people passed when they drove down to the beach for vacation. 

My grandparents, Nanny and Papa, owned a pine tree farm in Clarence. 100 acres, and 75 of those acres were rows upon rows of loblolly pine trees. They lived on the property in a small farmhouse at the end of a long dirt driveway. It was small, and while it may have been nearly prehistoric, it never felt creepy. It felt like a cozy respite, a home away from home; sitting like an island in the middle of a large yard dotted with gnarled towering oak, walnut, and pecan trees. There were rickety barns as old as the dirt they sat on. Sprawling garden beds with herbs, flowers and vegetables. Wooden arbors overgrown with pluming heaps of muscadine grape vines. All acting as a buffer for the pine rows that surrounded the house on three sides. 

The remaining 20-or-so acres behind the pine rows were dense woods, cut down the middle by a winding trail that lead to the river. Nanny and Papa had clear-cut those 75 acres and planted the pines about 10 years prior. Papa passed away when I was small, and Nanny wasn’t far behind him, passing a few years later.

We inherited their cherished little farmhouse and pine tree farm.

We couldn’t live at the farm, of course. My Dad already had a job, and nobody gets a weekly paycheck to watch pine trees grow. So while adding the upkeep of a farm would be a heavy burden on top of a 9-5 work week, it was a labor of love that my parents were used to. Before Nanny passed, we would come down to Clarence to visit her every other weekend, giving her a hand with house work and yard work- especially as she got older. In the spring and summer it was more like every weekend, a constant battle for my Dad to keep the vegetation from taking over.

Despite how exhausting it sounded, my busy-body parents enjoyed it. The farm was a way of staying near their family and friends, all while enjoying the rural lifestyle of their hometown again. Getting themselves and their only daughter away from the buzz of suburbia.

At the time of this story, the pines were somewhere between 12-15ft tall. Nanny had passed away in October and we didn’t return until spring that next year. It was the mid 90s, and I was 8 years old. 

We left home that March on a Friday afternoon and head down the interstate towards Clarence and our pine tree farm, a routine that we knew well. It was a 45 or-so minute drive, and once we pulled into town and got situated, Dad would stay at the house and start on yard-work. Mom and I would go to the grocery store, getting enough food to last us until we left Sunday afternoon.

The only grocery store in Clarence was the old Piggly Wiggly. I distinctly remember the sweet wrinkled smiles of its employees and the smell of cigarettes that hung in the air. 

Mom and I stood in the checkout line.

“Oh shi- shoot! Oh shoot! Honey I forgot the bread, can you run and grab one for me real quick?”

I gave her a chirpy “yes ma’am” and moved swiftly towards the bread aisle. I skirted to a stop when I realized there was a small display right there by checkout. A table laid out with checkerboard table cloth, loaves carefully placed in circular tiers. I snatched up a loaf, brought it to my mom and we headed home. 

We drove back to the farmhouse in my Mom’s station wagon, a new single by Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers was on the radio. Anticipation began to build as I stared eagerly out the window, in childish awe of the countryside’s vast emerging greenery.

We turned off of the road, patches of field on either side of the long dirt driveway leading up to the farmhouse, which sat at the end like a lady. A sweet, modest, classy thing, built in 1903. She was stark white, laced with gingerbread trim. Full, blossoming azalea bushes hemmed the wide front porch like a skirt, all of her topped off with an evergreen tin roof that sang me to sleep in the rain.

My mom backed her station wagon up to the front porch and I helped her as we began to take in groceries. 

We heard him coming before we saw him. A humming engine sang over a chorus of baying hounds. 

It was Mr. Voss, our neighbor. His hunting beagles running spiritedly behind his ATV, a howling snarling cloud of dust tearing down the road before turning into our driveway.

My Dad pulled up beside us in his creaky old brown work truck, that I had affectionately named “Bear,” when I was small. Because it was brown, and it growled. 

Dad hopped out. He ruffled my hair, and gave my mom a kiss on the cheek.

“Hey squirt. Hey honey, Dan called- said we needed to talk.”

“Everything okay?”

“I guess we’ll find out. Hope so. Need any help with those groceries?”

“No, no, I’ve got my sidekick here helping me, you invite Dan inside and I’ll bring you boys something to drink.”

Dad gave me a wink and a pat on the back before he walked up to greet Mr. Voss who had pulled up and cut the power on his ATV, his dogs gallivanting off to play and sniff around. My dad always looked so big and strong to me, but next to Mr Voss he looked small. I heard the frame creak as he dismounted his machine. 

Daniel Voss was Clarence’s nearly retired fire chief, and when he wasn’t in uniform he was in camo. He shook Dad’s hand with a pursed smile under his mustache, and nodded towards my mother and me.

“Mrs Willis, little Miss Willis,” 

He directed his attention back to my dad. “Thanks for letting me stop by, Peter.”

“Hey, no problem man. Everything alright? You sounded serious over the phone.”

My mom took the last bag of groceries and shooed me off to play. I was old enough to understand that the adults were talking and I needed to scadaddle. However, I was also a talented eavesdropper, as most children are. I ran along the side of the house, sneaking in through the back door. I found a nice hiding spot behind a small wooden bench in the hallway. There was a mirror on the wall, giving me a peak into the living room where Dad knelt striking a match in the fireplace, while Mr. Voss made comments about the weather and the sitting president. 

After Mom had put away the groceries she joined them with a handful of empty glasses. She grabbed a bottle of whisky from the top of the china cabinet and poured them all a shot of the syrupy golden spirit. Mr Voss sat in the tattered plaid wingback by the fireplace, a small modest flame beginning to crackle in its hearth. He laced and re-laced his fingers, as if he was somewhat apprehensive to begin the conversation until suddenly he cleared his throat.

“So Peter, Lori, I know y’all just rolled into town, but I had to fill you folks in on what’s been going on around here lately. It’s a matter of safety, especially with yer little youngin’ running around.”

I always thought it was such a shame that Mr Voss chewed tobacco all the time. Not only because I thought spitting dip was gross, but because it prevented him from speaking as much. Mr Voss sounded like the lowest string on a fiddle, his vocal chords oiled with old southern blood. A lullaby with seamless rises and dips in cadence, every sentence a resonant stanza in a ballad. He would recall a trip to the post office to the tune of an old campfire story. 

That early evening in March, as dusk and its chill fell upon the treetops of Clarence and the sun sank low in a peach colored sky, I noticed that Mr Voss’ speech was unobscured by his usual lip full of dip. 

I settled into my hiding spot. This must be serious. Mr Voss was about to spin a yarn.

“So, all of this started in late November, best we can all surmise. Rumors began floating around right after Thanksgiving. Late November, 'ya know, 'ya had boys out there on their land or their buddy’s land hunting deer and ducks, doves and geese. Fat and happy in their camo, believe me I was one of ‘em. But a few of ‘em made some grizzly discoveries. They, uh, found some animal carcasses while they were huntin’.” 

The puzzled looks on my parents faces were suddenly imbued with concern. Mr Voss took a sip of his whisky and continued, 

“As I’m sure you both know, eastwards, right yander across the river from your property is Ed Kerry’s huntin’ land. He’s got about 50 acres or thereabouts. Well, Kerry and his boys were huntin’ in the wee hours of the morning, planning on shacking up in a little hunting stand near a clearing in the center of the property. Once they got up there and started lookin’ around, they found a buck-”

His voice cracked for a moment as his eyes flickered between Mom and Dad. 

“-a *mutilated* buck… At first, they thought it was a pack of coyotes, maybe a bobcat. But the more they saw, the harder it was to rationalize in their minds. Now Peter, Lori, I don’t mean to be graphic, but I think it’s important that you know the details.” 

He paused, waiting for one of them to stop him, but neither did. 

“It was fresh. The neck was broken, violently. It had been ‘eviscerated’ as one of Kerry’s boys put it. Ed said it was a mess, carnage just- everywhere. Something had taken a bite through its leg at the haunches, cracked right through the bones, and crushed the socket when it ripped it out. Ed said the bite was this big,”

He gestured, but from outside of my peeping-mirror’s view.

My Dad exhaled in disbelief.

My mom winced, a pained look on her face.

“My God, Dan.”

“By December’s end they had found that buck, and a few more animals torn up to a similar degree. The week before Christmas, I was in the field near the border of your property, and I saw a lump of fur layin' off yander in the field. I was worried it was one of my beagles. But once I got up close to it I saw it was a coyote. There were these deep gashes, from the tips of the ribs on one side to the tips of the ribs on the other. I could see the oval shape of the bite mark, it had a set of jaws- I mean a *big* set jaws, like Ed had said. Must’ve just held its ribcage in its mouth and bitten down on it.”

 Mr Voss paused, lost in thought for a moment.

“Peter I’ve never seen anything like it. It was a nightmare, I’m just glad the wife didn’t stumble on it.”

Mr Voss downed what was left of his whisky. I heard the clink of his glass as he sat it on coffee table. 

“Then, about 2 weeks later David Kilpatrick and his daughter were out huntin’ on Kerry’s land. 'Ya know Kerry’s boy, Joey, been sweet on her for a while, so Kerry lets Dave take her out there huntin’. Give Joey something to bond with her over and all that. Well, the little lady bags her a doe, so her and Dave head over to it, trudging through all the brush and fallen leaves and what have 'ya to tag it. As they’re walking over, girl goes to hop over this recently fallen sweet gum tree. That poor child landed in a dead buck’s corpse. It was almost all skeleton, but fallin into a leathery cracked-open rib cage shakes her up pretty good. Dave said that its head was all gnawed up with big ol’ teeth marks, and the antlers were crunched. Now I don’t know about you but I’ve never heard of a bite that’d crunch antlers on a deer like that.”

My dad shook his head, staring off in a daze. “No, never.”

“Well, then Neal found another coyote, said it looked just like the one on my property. But who knows, it could’ve been skinned alive and split in half and Neal wouldn’t mention it. You know Neal, you could tie him to the railroad tracks and he’d barely mumble about it. Last thing I’d heard was a week ago when Bill found a doe. He was near the border of your property, said he’d been fixing a fence post earlier that day and left his pack of smokes out there. So he hopped in his truck in his pajamas that night and went back to fetch 'em. The same fence post he’d fixed was broken again, and not 10 feet from it was a doe. She’d been ripped apart at the rib cage. Bill said it looked like a damn frog dissection from high school.”

All of them were silent for a long moment, the only sound the crackling in the fireplace.

Dad spoke up, “What is everybody thinking? A bear?”

I heard Mr Voss sniff, as he nodded. “Bear. Maybe a big wolf.”

“I’ve heard of bear wandering down this far south occasionally, but a wolf? I don’t know…”

Mr Voss inclined his hand toward the the whisky bottle on the table, Dad encouraged him to help himself, so Mr Voss poured everyone another finger.

“A bear, a wolf, whatever it is- it’s a devil. The damage it does is just- gruesome.” 

“Nobody's found any tracks?”

“Not in the leaves. You know how it is this time of year. You’re practically wading through ‘em.”

Mr Voss sighed as he fiddled with the glass, so small in his hands.

“But I wanted to catch you as soon as you arrived, Peter, and I know I don’t need to spell this out for you, yer a smart fella. But we’re finding bodies north, south, east and west of here, and l’m not trying to alarm you folks but- I think you know as well as I do that you might have some dead animals on your property.”

At that I decided to make my exit, sneaking away from my hiding spot. I figured I would need to be in position when Mom or Dad came to tell me about my inevitable new ground rules. 

I ran off to the squatty structure near the back of the house, what my Nanny had called “The Kitty Cat Barn.” It was a dilapidated flat-roof barn, enlaced with morning glories that crawled through the rusted rotting holes in its ancient metal siding. It seems to have once been a small barn for a couple of work animals like donkeys or small horses, but Papa had put shelves up and Nanny just used it to store her preserves. However as she and Papa got older, they garnered a large collection of stray cats, as the sweet and elderly have a habit of doing. So near the end of their life, they gave away all their preserves to their kids and their friends from church and stocked the shelves instead with baskets and boxes, lined with soft old towels and worn rags. Setting out a couple dozen of little bowls for them to eat from. When we weren’t there, one of our neighbors, Mrs. Kerry, gladly came out and fed them for us in exchange for herbs from the garden, though she rarely ever took any. 

I squatted on the dirt floor of the barn. It wasn’t long before a handful of kittens clumsily wandered out to investigate my presence. Moments later, what I assumed was their mother, came over and began nuzzling up against me. I rubbed gently behind her velvety ears before walking out of the barn. I made sounds gesturing for the kittens to come out into the grass to play, but their mood shifted and they would not come. They only stood in the doorway beside their mother, watching me. I scoffed. *Cats*.

Not a moment later, Mom came over, asking if we could talk. We sat on one of the steps of the back door stoop. She gave me a frank but watered down version of Mr. Voss’s story, then laid down the law. 

 “No playing in the pine rows, and no going outside for any reason after sunset. If you see something, anything, out of the ordinary- come tell myself or your father, immediately. Are we clear?”

“Yes ma’am.”

She asked if knew what to do if I was approached by a bear or a wolf, and I prattled off the steps to her. Don’t run. Back away slowly. If it approaches you, try to make yourself look big. All that. I can tell this relaxed her a bit, and she told me to have fun playing, and to be careful. 

The rest of the day was as pleasant as any day when you were 8. I ran aimlessly all over the yard, not much different from Mr Voss’s beagles. I stopped by the arbor to pick muscadine grapes. I helped Mom do some work in the flower beds, and before I knew it it was time to come inside. She threw a Disney movie into the small tube television in my room while she worked in the kitchen. Dad came in and washed up from doing yard work all day, the farmhouse’s old pipes groaning as he showered. We had dinner that night, I can’t recall what it was, but it was warm and I went back for seconds. After Dad and I cleaned the kitchen for Mom, we all sat at on the floor of the living room, playing Old Maid and talking by the fire. As the evening drew to a close, we all started getting ready for bed. 

That was the first night I saw the beast.

I remember it well. 

After I had given Dad a kiss and told him goodnight, Mom tucked me into bed under the fresh linens she had put on earlier that afternoon. She kissed my head reminding me to say my prayers before turning off the lights and closing the door, bidding me goodnight. 

Prayers said, I waited for sleep to overcome me but it never did. I tossed and turned for a while, before quietly sliding out of bed and slinking over to my window. The cats would always come out at night, and the view from outside of my bedroom window happened to be a particularly high traffic cat crossing. 

There were bushes beneath my window, and looking past them you could see paths that wound between and around garden beds brimming with various flowers and herbs. Behind them was the smallest of the barns that adorned the yard, Nanny had used it for storing gardening equipment and potting soil. It may have been geriatric, but it was a sturdy structure. It had survived an oak falling on it a couple years before and still stood tall. Behind it was a small stretch of field, and then the sea of pine rows.

I peered out of the antique, single pane glass. Keeping my breaths shallow as to not fog it up. I searched the shadows for cats, when my eye caught something in the distance. Deer occasionally appeared during these midnight matinees, strolling in the field or leaping through the pine rows. 

But this shape wasn’t moving like that.

The more I focused in on it, the more I saw that it was larger than I had thought. Larger than a deer. My sleepy brain began to dial in, seemingly aware that this was something outside of our routine viewing. I concentrated on the shape, holding my breath so as to ease my face as close to the glass as possible.

It prowled beneath the branches, its spine arched, its limbs creeping like a spider. Slow, deliberate movements, its ashen form lurked in the dark obscurity of the pine rows. It horrified me to think that if I hadn’t been deliberately looking at it, I could have cast a glance out the window and not even noticed it. 

Being that I was child, I did what any child might do. In my horror, I hyperventilated and broke into tears. I went running into my parents’ room. Desperate and pitiful, trying to explain to them what I saw. Mom was quick to fall into her maternal instincts, holding me close, wiping away my tears and stroking my hair. My Dad rubbed my back to comfort me, but his mind had gone back to the discussion with Mr Voss. 

“Did you see its face honey? Did it look like a bear?”

I quickly shook my head, eyes still wet with tears. 

“No- no it wasn’t a bear. It was too… too tall and long. A- a bear would be… less- gangly. This wasn’t. And it didn’t have any fur. It was-”

The more I thought back on the beast the more scared I became, all over again, until I burst into tears. I buried my face into my mother’s shoulder.

“It was so awful,” I sobbed, 

“I just want it to never come back.” 

My parents exchanged sympathetic looks. I slept in bed with them that night.



The next day was business as usual. In the morning after breakfast I helped Mom with some chores and then was released into the yard to play. I rode my bike up and down the dirt driveway while I listened to my Walkman. Mom watched me from the front porch while she mended some of Dad’s overalls. After a while she called me to help her again in the garden. We watered and weeded until it was time for lunch. Mom made grilled cheese and tomato soup. Dad came in, just having finished weed-eating, so he was a little dirty and peppered with blades of grass. We talked and ate and joked around. It wasn’t until Mom and I were doing the dishes that I noticed that Dad had vanished.

“Where’s Dad?” I asked, a little incredulously, at the absence of my dishwashing partner.

Mom’s eyes never left her work as she spoke, 

“He’s meeting Mr Voss.”

“Why?”

“Just to check out the Pine Rows”

She said nonchalantly. I didn’t press her about it, I knew they were out searching for dead animals.

Dad didn’t return until it was nearly dinner time. He didn’t say hey, he didn’t go to the kitchen for something to drink, he went straight to the shower. I could hear the pipes from my bedroom. During dinner, Dad seemed tired, but he put on a tired smile, asking me about my day and what all Mom and I had been up to. I had a feeling he didn’t want me to ask about his day, so I blabbed about everything Mom and I had done, how the cats were acting, and the songs I listened to on my Walkman. After we ate, I asked if I could go watch a movie in my room until lights out. My parents eagerly obliged. 

I sat cross legged on my bed, pretending to watch the Black Cauldron, I saw Dad pass my bedroom door. I tiptoed over, peaking my head out, watching him make his way wearily through the house and out to the front porch. I heard the pipes creak and knew Mom would be joining him shortly. 

Sensing an interesting conversation on the horizon, I took up a hiding spot near a coat rack by the front door, with a great view out the window and onto the front porch. I watched as Dad fell back into a rocking chair, exhausted. He packed and lit his briar pipe. The sky bore pearly hues of blush and lilac as it laid the day to rest. Dad leaned back, the embers in his pipe akin to the glow of the sunset as he took a long deep pull, exhaling a swirling plume of smoke.

I ducked down as Mom walked by. Her skin still rosey from her hot shower. Her hair was thrown up in a bun, and all her makeup was off. But she was more beautiful than the dusk sky, and Dad’s eyes corroborated my opinion. 

She met his gaze with a gentle smile, joining him in an adjacent rocking chair with a glass of wine in one hand and a beer in another. 

“I saw your bloody jeans in the hamper. I assume you had a 'work boots' kind of day.” She said with a weak laugh.

Dad scoffed. Mom always teased him for wearing the same pair of very-off-white New Balances all the time. She used to make comments to me on the days she saw them sitting by the back door, saying that he must be out doing dirty work. 

“You and Dan found an animal out there today?”

“Multiple.” Dad replied, his pipe hanging from the corner of his mouth as he cracked open his beer. 

“Two deer, a coyote, and a bobcat. We buried one of the deer and the bobcat. The rest of them were decayed enough or out of the way enough that we said ‘to hell with it.’”

Mom pensively said nothing.

“Dan called his game warden buddy, kind of a jack-ass, in my opinion. He told us to get photographic evidence. So Dan snapped some photos, said he’s gonna get ‘em developed tomorrow afternoon.”

The were a few lingering moments of silence until Mom spoke, asking softly,  

“What had happened to them?”

I heard Dad’s pipe clack between his teeth after taking another pull. By then the woody aroma had drifted into the house from under the front door. The smell of his tobacco was earthy, rich and sweet. He paused, taking a swig of his beer before answering. 

“A few of the deer seemed to have recently rotted down to their skeletons. Lots of their bones were broken, so we couldn’t quite put together what had happened to them; and ya’ know the vultures had probably gotten to ‘em and moved stuff around too. The coyote carcass was maybe a month old, it looked something had put a bunch of weight down on its ribs and crushed it. The bobcat-“

Dad stopped for a moment, as if remembering in awe.

“The bobcat was fresh Lori, real fresh. Past 24 hours fresh.”

“Oh my God, Peter.”

“It was a big one too. We found it at the base of a black walnut tree. It looked like it’s spine had been snapped against the trunk, and then something just-“ dad gestured with his hands, digging at the air. Sparing the gory details.

“All the blood on my clothes was from the Bobcat.”

“Well, thank God we didn’t let Amy play in the pine rows yesterday, how far was it from the house?”

“It was near the back of the rows, towards the woods. After we found and buried it we decided to call it quits for the day, but we’ll finish tomorrow, Dan said he’d help me.”

“Finish?”

“Yeah, we only got halfway around the pines, Lori. We still have to look around the other half tomorrow.”

The quiet returned for a few moments. Hanging in the air with the smoke from Dad’s pipe.

“Lori, don’t let Amy out of your sight.” I saw Mom nodding her head.

“I’m gonna keep the Benelli by the back door, it’s the semi-automatic, I remember you said you felt comfortable with that one. And I’m gonna keep the thirty-thirty, the Marlin, by the front door. I doubt it would just come up to the house in broad daylight, but I want you to be prepared in case I’m not here at the house with you.”

“That’s a good idea. And I think when Amy plays outside I need to tell her to stay in view of the windows. So you or I can see her.”

“Okay, good thinking. And we’ll need to ask her not to have her Walkman on her ears while she’s out there. I don’t want something sneaking up on her.”

Mom scoffed, “She’s not gonna like that.”

“Nah, she’s smart. If we explain it to her I’m sure she’ll understand.”

I didn’t like that. 

But I knew as well as they did that I would, in all likelihood, comply. Mom and Dad were reasonable, so I usually did.

“I know this is all scary for her- shit, it’s scary for all of us.”

“What the hell do you think this thing is Peter?”

 Dad let out a long exasperated sigh, as though he’d been asking himself that very thing all day. “The best thing I can figure is a bear. A very, very large bear. But who knows, I mean, we looked, but we didn’t see any tracks or scat or anything.”

“There were no tracks near the path? Even near the bobcat?”

Dad shook his head, “Too many pine needles. I mean years and years worth. We saw indentions in the earth under them, but nothing we could decipher.”

Dad finished his beer, setting it down on the ground by his rocking chair.

“Tomorrow, Dan’s gonna help me check the second half of the pine rows. He said one day next week he could send his nephews out on their four wheelers to check the woods that back up to the river.”

“Oh gosh is that safe?”

“It’s been a few years but those little rascals are grown, they’re young men now, they’re almost as tall as Dan.”

Mom hummed, not convinced, but opting to move on. “That’s nice of Dan to help you.”

“Yeah, he didn’t ask for anything but I told him I’d throw him and his nephews some cash for the help. I wish I could say I was hopeful, but I worry what those boys might find out there.”

I heard one of their rocking chairs creak as they moved to stand up, so I quietly scurried back off to my room. My parents didn’t bring it up to me that night or ever, didn’t say anything about it at all. Likely fearful that I would have another “nightmare.”



The last day, Sunday afternoon, Mom and I did the laundry and packed our things. The packing didn’t take long. We left most of our stuff behind, seeing that we would be back next weekend. Once I had my little red and white polka dot duffle bag tucked in the trunk of her station wagon Mom told me I could play until we left in a couple of hours. I climbed my favorite tree, an oak near the back door that Dad had nailed wooden steps onto. Mom sat outside with me, folding laundry. I finished my Goosebumps book, so I examined my pockets and discovered a long screw. Lord know where I’d found it or why I’d picked it up but I decided it was time to carve my initials into a tree. 

Mom and I both heard the phone in the house ring, so she hopped up to get it. Probably Aunt Cheryl. She had been meaning to stop by that weekend but Mom had told her it wasn’t a great time. While carving an “A” from way up in the tree I saw Dad coming over from the shop barn. It was the largest of the barns, and Papa had used it as a workshop. From the shade of the enormous oak beside the barn, it looked like Dad had grabbed a rag, using it to wipe something on his shirt. As he stepped out into the light I could see that it was blood. Red, fresh.

Dad didn’t see me in the tree, so he didn't put on any heirs. He pulled his baseball cap off and wiped the sweat on his forehead with his arm. For a busy-body who normally took such long purposeful strides, his steps were slow. Heavy. His face was so white. His eyes were locked onto the ground in front of him as he walked. My dad looked scared. 

Mom tried to covertly put his dirty clothes in a bag while Dad showered and got changed. I didn’t say anything. Dad didn’t know I’d seen him, and Mom thought I was none the wiser. We turned off all the lights, locked all the doors, and then hit the road for home. Looking out my window at the lush greenery of the countryside that had so enamored me only days before, I couldn’t help but think now that it only acted as a shroud, a living, flowering veil that hid the beast lurking within. 



Back at home in the sardine can of suburbia, any moment absent of conscious thought was overcome with visions of the beast. If I had been any older, it would have been an easy write off, *“its just a nightmare,” “you’re crazy,” “go see a psychologist;”* but I wasn’t. I was an 8 year old little girl who read mythology encyclopedias and fairy tale compendiums like I was going for a PhD. I actively side stepped mushroom rings for fear of being kidnapped by the fae. A small piece of every Little Debbie cake I got was left near the crawl space door in case we had hobgoblins or brownies living under our house (which at the time, I seriously suspected we did).

My parents, the logic-bound adults could chock it all up to a subconscious presentation of a fear response, but I didn’t want to lie to myself.

I knew what I saw. 

As harrowing as it was, I kept mulling it over in my mind. Turning it over, rotating it at different angles, all in hopes of better understanding what it really was- the devil outside my bedroom window. If I was acting spacey, my friends at school didn’t say anything, at least not to my face. In the hallway, at lunch, at P.E. It possessed my every thought. 

The list of things I didn’t know about it was infinite, so I started with what I did know about it. 

It was large. Tall. I tried to think of it in comparison to the pines, and in doing so I stumbled upon a memory. It was a year before Nanny died, I was small, but not small enough to forget. It was the last time she was able to walk the pine rows with me. Her hair was as white as her sweet little farmhouse, and her bones burled and bent with age. Her voice was as gentle as the rustle in the pine needles. She said that because the pines were all planted so close together, the lowest of the branches wouldn’t get enough sunlight. As a result, they would drop off while the higher branches would reach upwards to take in more sunlight. I remember her smiling, as if that fact meant something to her.

She said that Papa had measured, and most of the branches in the pine rows were 5-7 feet from the ground. 

With that information at my disposal. I did some guesswork, but my safe guess was that it had been at least 4 feet, or probably more like 5 feet tall, on all fours.

It’s torso and appendages were lean. Not stocky, like a bear’s. Bears weren’t built that way. Why was I still thinking about bears? It definitely wasn’t a bear. What features I did see resembled a wolf, but wolves weren’t that large, that hairless, or that lanky. Neither were bears. My head began to throb. Whatever small annoying part of my brain *had* started developing was trying desperately to compare it to what I knew to be real. Thankfully the rest of my mind was fantastical and thought mermaids existed, so instead of having a psychological breakdown like an adult, I came to grips with the fact that this beast was a wolf-like and in all likelihood a werewolf. But I needed to do some research.  

That day after school, I asked Mom to take me to the library, a request she was used to. On the car ride there, she asked me what kind of book I was going to look for. So I explained my werewolf theory to her. A decision I immediately regretted when I saw the pity and concern within her eyes in the rear view mirror. 

“Honey, I know we’ve talked about all of this with the fairies and the mermaids and the unicorns, but werewolves aren’t real honey. I love that you have such a vivid imagination, but you’ve got to be realistic. I mean, sure, it might have been that bear or wolf out in the woods, but it was probably just a nightmare-“

“It couldn’t be a nightmare, I was at the window, and I know what I saw! It wasn’t normal looking- It didn’t look like a bear or a wolf, it was something else. I’m 100% sure that I saw what I saw! Mom, I swear- I swear I’m not lying.”

I saw the pained deliberation in her eyes. Outside of my fascination and proclivity for fairy stories I was pretty practical for my age. I listened to Mom and Dad when they told me things, I was forthcoming and honest if I did something I wasn’t supposed to. I wouldn’t blatantly lie to my Mom, and she knew that.

“Well, then, baby… if you really did see what you think you saw then- well, then it must have been a nightmare. And you’ve slept walked before! You know you were probably just sleep walking, had a nightmare, and woke at the window.”

My brow furrowed, taking what my mom said into consideration but not able to convince myself. I stared out the window in deep thought until we pulled up to the library.

Once we arrived, I didn’t have to worry about trying to give my Mom the slip. My love of books and stories came from her, and she made a B-line for the mystery section. Despite her dismissal of my werewolf theory, she loved spooky stories. 

  After collecting a few books from the sections labeled “folklore” and “nature science,” I found an empty table and started to read. I skimmed through a couple of books on mythology and American folklore and the like, none of its pages revealing any groundbreaking revelations. Silver bullets, transformation under the light of the moon, all the usual factoids. What was highly informative, however, was the expository book on wolves. 

How fast they were, how much power and stamina they possessed, how strong their bite was, how sharp their eyes were, how keen their sense of smell was; all the things that made them great hunters. I kept in mind that this was all a baseline for this creature. At the *very least* it did all these things. The thought overcame me with dread. I didn’t exactly calculate the metrics, but I knew that this monster likely doubled if not tripled anything a wolf could do. 

Knowing that time was running out before Mom came to fetch me, I ran over to the children’s section and grabbed a Junie B. Jones book I hadn’t read yet, as well as the newest Goosebumps book.

When I approached Mom, I tried to hide my wolf book under my selection of age appropriate literature, but Lori didn’t miss a thing.

“Study of the American Wolf, huh?”

I tried to brush past her comment and critical side eye,

“I thought you said I needed to be more realistic. Wolves are real, aren’t they?”

She sighed, rolling her eyes, handing it and my other books over to the librarian for check out. 



That evening at home, we had finished dinner and cleared the dining room table to play Jenga. The phone rang, and Dad stepped out of the room and into the kitchen to take it. Dad answered in a hushed tone, keeping his voice down. Unfortunately for Dad, he wasn’t a great whisperer. 

“Hey Dan… find any-?…How many…?” 

Silence. For a long while, silence. Mom and I locked eyes.

“God… Yeah, I see. Thank the boys for me… I’ll pay em for all their help… we both know that’s a lot of work. So sorry they had to… yeah… well… my God… I don’t know either, man… Yeah… Yeah… Thanks again Dan.”

Dad returned, doing his best to hide the weary look on his face. He glanced over at my Mom, and then at me, giving me a smile. I smiled back timidly. 

I looked back and forth between Mom and Dad, as she gave him a look that said, *‘You know she heard all that, right?’*

Dad hummed, pursing his lips in a wry way. I couldn’t help but laugh at him. But the quiet that followed it sobered the moment.

""Amy,” My Dad paused as he weighed his words. “Your old man… is an awful whisperer.”

“Yeah, you kind of are.” I snickered.

“I know you’re a smart girl, even if you didn’t just hear me on the phone, I know that you know that some scary stuff is going on right now.”

I nodded. Dad sat back down at the table, folding his hands as he spoke.

“But I want you to know that while we’re at the farm, you aren’t in any danger as long as you listen to what your mother and I say. Follow the rules, stay in the yard, and don’t go into the pine rows. I don’t want this to cause you too much distress, because none of this is going to last forever. 

Mr Voss, myself and some other people in the community are getting evidence together, and filling paperwork out- which is stupid- but we are doing it to see if we can get the game warden or someone from DNR involved. Whoever ends up helping us, they will know what to do. Its their job, that my taxes pay for by the way, and the fact that they haven’t sent someone out already is-“

Mom kicked Dad under the table. Dad cleared his throat. 

“The point is, whatever this thing is, a bear, a wolf, its just wandered too far out of its habitat. Whenever someone from the state *does* get out there, they’ll either capture it or kill it or do whatever they have to to keep people safe, to keep us safe.” 

I nodded again with a small smile. I thought it was sweet that Mom and Dad were trying to keep my spirits up, especially when I could tell all of this weighed on them so heavily. 

I tried to lighten the mood a little bit, the way any 8 year old girl would, by being a little snarky.

“So, what will we do if the game warden looks at everything and says its a werewolf?” I said. 

To me it was only kind of a joke, but to Mom and Dad it was ridiculous, and that was all that mattered. Dad smirked.

“Ah yes, your mother told me all about your werewolf theory.”

“Well, what if it is?” I crossed my arms, making a face that wrinkled my nose.

Dad put on a gravely serious look, laying it on thick. 

“If it is, I’ll just have to melt down your mother’s silver dinnerware set into bullets.”

“Oh no you won’t! That set is an heirloom!” 

Dad dramatically lifted his hands, dropping them back down on the table in defeat.

“Well then, I guess your mother is just going to let us all die,”

Mom and I cracked up. Dad attempted to remain dry but the corners of his mouth crept up into a smile. 

“We’ll just have to try and stab the thing with silver butter knives. That’ll show ‘em.”

We cut-up for the rest of the evening, our hearts full of mirth as we turned in for the night. None of us spoke about it again for the rest of the week. But it festered in our minds, leaked into every unoccupied moment. I could see the apprehension buried in their eyes when they were lost in thought, driving, cooking dinner, staring out the window. I lied awake in bed every night, counting down the days until Friday, when we returned to the farm.

1okhla5,https://i.redd.it/eloe8w2wmcyf1.jpeg,Glowing Goddess vs Primal Queen,"So this ad keeps following me everywhere showing Glowing Goddess as the ""better, cheaper"" alternative to Primal Queen. At first I was like ok maybe I should switch because who doesn't want to save $15/month??

The comparison looked good enough... cheaper price, better quality, whatever. But idk something felt weird about it. Like when those random skincare brands pop up claiming they're better than Drunk Elephant but cost $12

anyway I'm not good at researching stuff online but I tried to find literally anything about who owns this company?? Nothing. Like... nothing? How do you sell supplements and not have an about page. Even my local coffee shop has an about page lol. Meanwhile Primal Queen has that blonde girl all over their Instagram. At least she's real

Also the Australian beef thing... ok so they keep saying Argentina has some disease but when I googled ""Argentina beef disease"" I couldn't find anything recent? Like wouldn't that be news?? Actually wait I think I saw something about it from like 2001 but that was forever ago. But then I tried to find proof that Glowing Goddess actually uses Australian beef and there's literally nothing. No certificates, nothing.. Just them saying it over and over

The thing that really got me was I searched for reviews outside their website (because duh their own site only shows 5 stars) and found nothing. Zero reviews on reddit, no YouTube videos, no blog posts. How does a supplement company exist with zero real people talking about it??? Even those random Amazon supplements have some reviews.

oh and someone on Twitter said the pills they got looked nothing like the website photos which... yeah

I'm probably overthinking this but the whole thing gives me the same vibes as those Instagram boutiques that steal your credit card info. actually no that's dramatic but you know what I mean?? Like maybe I'm being paranoid but if you're putting organ meats in your body every day (which already sounds gross when you think about it too much) shouldn't the company at least have like... a real website.

1okhkti,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1okhkti/the_beast_in_the_pines_part_1/,"The Beast In The Pines, Part 1","My mom and dad were born and raised in Clarence, an old small town in the countryside between the midlands and the coast. A flat woodland, lush from its snaking rivers and creeks. Its swamps bled into the marshes and down through the deltas into the salty southern coast that was a little over an hour away. Clarence was the little nothing-town people passed when they drove down to the beach for vacation. 

My grandparents, Nanny and Papa, owned a pine tree farm in Clarence. 100 acres, and 75 of those acres were rows upon rows of loblolly pine trees. They lived on the property in a small farmhouse at the end of a long dirt driveway. It was small, and while it may have been nearly prehistoric, it never felt creepy. It felt like a cozy respite, a home away from home; sitting like an island in the middle of a large yard dotted with gnarled towering oak, walnut, and pecan trees. There were rickety barns as old as the dirt they sat on. Sprawling garden beds with herbs, flowers and vegetables. Wooden arbors overgrown with pluming heaps of muscadine grape vines. All acting as a buffer for the pine rows that surrounded the house on three sides. 

The remaining 20-or-so acres behind the pine rows were dense woods, cut down the middle by a winding trail that lead to the river. Nanny and Papa had clear-cut those 75 acres and planted the pines about 10 years prior. Papa passed away when I was small, and Nanny wasn’t far behind him, passing a few years later.

We inherited their cherished little farmhouse and pine tree farm.

We couldn’t live at the farm, of course. My Dad already had a job, and nobody gets a weekly paycheck to watch pine trees grow. So while adding the upkeep of a farm would be a heavy burden on top of a 9-5 work week, it was a labor of love that my parents were used to. Before Nanny passed, we would come down to Clarence to visit her every other weekend, giving her a hand with house work and yard work- especially as she got older. In the spring and summer it was more like every weekend, a constant battle for my Dad to keep the vegetation from taking over.

Despite how exhausting it sounded, my busy-body parents enjoyed it. The farm was a way of staying near their family and friends, all while enjoying the rural lifestyle of their hometown again. Getting themselves and their only daughter away from the buzz of suburbia.

At the time of this story, the pines were somewhere between 12-15ft tall. Nanny had passed away in October and we didn’t return until spring that next year. It was the mid 90s, and I was 8 years old. 

We left home that March on a Friday afternoon and head down the interstate towards Clarence and our pine tree farm, a routine that we knew well. It was a 45 or-so minute drive, and once we pulled into town and got situated, Dad would stay at the house and start on yard-work. Mom and I would go to the grocery store, getting enough food to last us until we left Sunday afternoon.

The only grocery store in Clarence was the old Piggly Wiggly. I distinctly remember the sweet wrinkled smiles of its employees and the smell of cigarettes that hung in the air. 

Mom and I stood in the checkout line.

“Oh shi- shoot! Oh shoot! Honey I forgot the bread, can you run and grab one for me real quick?”

I gave her a chirpy “yes ma’am” and moved swiftly towards the bread aisle. I skirted to a stop when I realized there was a small display right there by checkout. A table laid out with checkerboard table cloth, loaves carefully placed in circular tiers. I snatched up a loaf, brought it to my mom and we headed home. 

We drove back to the farmhouse in my Mom’s station wagon, a new single by Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers was on the radio. Anticipation began to build as I stared eagerly out the window, in childish awe of the countryside’s vast emerging greenery.

We turned off of the road, patches of field on either side of the long dirt driveway leading up to the farmhouse, which sat at the end like a lady. A sweet, modest, classy thing, built in 1903. She was stark white, laced with gingerbread trim. Full, blossoming azalea bushes hemmed the wide front porch like a skirt, all of her topped off with an evergreen tin roof that sang me to sleep in the rain.

My mom backed her station wagon up to the front porch and I helped her as we began to take in groceries. 

We heard him coming before we saw him. A humming engine sang over a chorus of baying hounds. 

It was Mr. Voss, our neighbor. His hunting beagles running spiritedly behind his ATV, a howling snarling cloud of dust tearing down the road before turning into our driveway.

My Dad pulled up beside us in his creaky old brown work truck, that I had affectionately named “Bear,” when I was small. Because it was brown, and it growled. 

Dad hopped out. He ruffled my hair, and gave my mom a kiss on the cheek.

“Hey squirt. Hey honey, Dan called- said we needed to talk.”

“Everything okay?”

“I guess we’ll find out. Hope so. Need any help with those groceries?”

“No, no, I’ve got my sidekick here helping me, you invite Dan inside and I’ll bring you boys something to drink.”

Dad gave me a wink and a pat on the back before he walked up to greet Mr. Voss who had pulled up and cut the power on his ATV, his dogs gallivanting off to play and sniff around. My dad always looked so big and strong to me, but next to Mr Voss he looked small. I heard the frame creak as he dismounted his machine. 

Daniel Voss was Clarence’s nearly retired fire chief, and when he wasn’t in uniform he was in camo. He shook Dad’s hand with a pursed smile under his mustache, and nodded towards my mother and me.

“Mrs Willis, little Miss Willis,” 

He directed his attention back to my dad. “Thanks for letting me stop by, Peter.”

“Hey, no problem man. Everything alright? You sounded serious over the phone.”

My mom took the last bag of groceries and shooed me off to play. I was old enough to understand that the adults were talking and I needed to scadaddle. However, I was also a talented eavesdropper, as most children are. I ran along the side of the house, sneaking in through the back door. I found a nice hiding spot behind a small wooden bench in the hallway. There was a mirror on the wall, giving me a peak into the living room where Dad knelt striking a match in the fireplace, while Mr. Voss made comments about the weather and the sitting president. 

After Mom had put away the groceries she joined them with a handful of empty glasses. She grabbed a bottle of whisky from the top of the china cabinet and poured them all a shot of the syrupy golden spirit. Mr Voss sat in the tattered plaid wingback by the fireplace, a small modest flame beginning to crackle in its hearth. He laced and re-laced his fingers, as if he was somewhat apprehensive to begin the conversation until suddenly he cleared his throat.

“So Peter, Lori, I know y’all just rolled into town, but I had to fill you folks in on what’s been going on around here lately. It’s a matter of safety, especially with yer little youngin’ running around.”

I always thought it was such a shame that Mr Voss chewed tobacco all the time. Not only because I thought spitting dip was gross, but because it prevented him from speaking as much. Mr Voss sounded like the lowest string on a fiddle, his vocal chords oiled with old southern blood. A lullaby with seamless rises and dips in cadence, every sentence a resonant stanza in a ballad. He would recall a trip to the post office to the tune of an old campfire story. 

That early evening in March, as dusk and its chill fell upon the treetops of Clarence and the sun sank low in a peach colored sky, I noticed that Mr Voss’ speech was unobscured by his usual lip full of dip. 

I settled into my hiding spot. This must be serious. Mr Voss was about to spin a yarn.

“So, all of this started in late November, best we can all surmise. Rumors began floating around right after Thanksgiving. Late November, 'ya know, 'ya had boys out there on their land or their buddy’s land hunting deer and ducks, doves and geese. Fat and happy in their camo, believe me I was one of ‘em. But a few of ‘em made some grizzly discoveries. They, uh, found some animal carcasses while they were huntin’.” 

The puzzled looks on my parents faces were suddenly imbued with concern. Mr Voss took a sip of his whisky and continued, 

“As I’m sure you both know, eastwards, right yander across the river from your property is Ed Kerry’s huntin’ land. He’s got about 50 acres or thereabouts. Well, Kerry and his boys were huntin’ in the wee hours of the morning, planning on shacking up in a little hunting stand near a clearing in the center of the property. Once they got up there and started lookin’ around, they found a buck-”

His voice cracked for a moment as his eyes flickered between Mom and Dad. 

“-a *mutilated* buck… At first, they thought it was a pack of coyotes, maybe a bobcat. But the more they saw, the harder it was to rationalize in their minds. Now Peter, Lori, I don’t mean to be graphic, but I think it’s important that you know the details.” 

He paused, waiting for one of them to stop him, but neither did. 

“It was fresh. The neck was broken, violently. It had been ‘eviscerated’ as one of Kerry’s boys put it. Ed said it was a mess, carnage just- everywhere. Something had taken a bite through its leg at the haunches, cracked right through the bones, and crushed the socket when it ripped it out. Ed said the bite was this big,”

He gestured, but from outside of my peeping-mirror’s view.

My Dad exhaled in disbelief.

My mom winced, a pained look on her face.

“My God, Dan.”

“By December’s end they had found that buck, and a few more animals torn up to a similar degree. The week before Christmas, I was in the field near the border of your property, and I saw a lump of fur layin' off yander in the field. I was worried it was one of my beagles. But once I got up close to it I saw it was a coyote. There were these deep gashes, from the tips of the ribs on one side to the tips of the ribs on the other. I could see the oval shape of the bite mark, it had a set of jaws- I mean a *big* set jaws, like Ed had said. Must’ve just held its ribcage in its mouth and bitten down on it.”

 Mr Voss paused, lost in thought for a moment.

“Peter I’ve never seen anything like it. It was a nightmare, I’m just glad the wife didn’t stumble on it.”

Mr Voss downed what was left of his whisky. I heard the clink of his glass as he sat it on coffee table. 

“Then, about 2 weeks later David Kilpatrick and his daughter were out huntin’ on Kerry’s land. 'Ya know Kerry’s boy, Joey, been sweet on her for a while, so Kerry lets Dave take her out there huntin’. Give Joey something to bond with her over and all that. Well, the little lady bags her a doe, so her and Dave head over to it, trudging through all the brush and fallen leaves and what have 'ya to tag it. As they’re walking over, girl goes to hop over this recently fallen sweet gum tree. That poor child landed in a dead buck’s corpse. It was almost all skeleton, but fallin into a leathery cracked-open rib cage shakes her up pretty good. Dave said that its head was all gnawed up with big ol’ teeth marks, and the antlers were crunched. Now I don’t know about you but I’ve never heard of a bite that’d crunch antlers on a deer like that.”

My dad shook his head, staring off in a daze. “No, never.”

“Well, then Neal found another coyote, said it looked just like the one on my property. But who knows, it could’ve been skinned alive and split in half and Neal wouldn’t mention it. You know Neal, you could tie him to the railroad tracks and he’d barely mumble about it. Last thing I’d heard was a week ago when Bill found a doe. He was near the border of your property, said he’d been fixing a fence post earlier that day and left his pack of smokes out there. So he hopped in his truck in his pajamas that night and went back to fetch 'em. The same fence post he’d fixed was broken again, and not 10 feet from it was a doe. She’d been ripped apart at the rib cage. Bill said it looked like a damn frog dissection from high school.”

All of them were silent for a long moment, the only sound the crackling in the fireplace.

Dad spoke up, “What is everybody thinking? A bear?”

I heard Mr Voss sniff, as he nodded. “Bear. Maybe a big wolf.”

“I’ve heard of bear wandering down this far south occasionally, but a wolf? I don’t know…”

Mr Voss inclined his hand toward the the whisky bottle on the table, Dad encouraged him to help himself, so Mr Voss poured everyone another finger.

“A bear, a wolf, whatever it is- it’s a devil. The damage it does is just- gruesome.” 

“Nobody's found any tracks?”

“Not in the leaves. You know how it is this time of year. You’re practically wading through ‘em.”

Mr Voss sighed as he fiddled with the glass, so small in his hands.

“But I wanted to catch you as soon as you arrived, Peter, and I know I don’t need to spell this out for you, yer a smart fella. But we’re finding bodies north, south, east and west of here, and l’m not trying to alarm you folks but- I think you know as well as I do that you might have some dead animals on your property.”

At that I decided to make my exit, sneaking away from my hiding spot. I figured I would need to be in position when Mom or Dad came to tell me about my inevitable new ground rules. 

I ran off to the squatty structure near the back of the house, what my Nanny had called “The Kitty Cat Barn.” It was a dilapidated flat-roof barn, enlaced with morning glories that crawled through the rusted rotting holes in its ancient metal siding. It seems to have once been a small barn for a couple of work animals like donkeys or small horses, but Papa had put shelves up and Nanny just used it to store her preserves. However as she and Papa got older, they garnered a large collection of stray cats, as the sweet and elderly have a habit of doing. So near the end of their life, they gave away all their preserves to their kids and their friends from church and stocked the shelves instead with baskets and boxes, lined with soft old towels and worn rags. Setting out a couple dozen of little bowls for them to eat from. When we weren’t there, one of our neighbors, Mrs. Kerry, gladly came out and fed them for us in exchange for herbs from the garden, though she rarely ever took any. 

I squatted on the dirt floor of the barn. It wasn’t long before a handful of kittens clumsily wandered out to investigate my presence. Moments later, what I assumed was their mother, came over and began nuzzling up against me. I rubbed gently behind her velvety ears before walking out of the barn. I made sounds gesturing for the kittens to come out into the grass to play, but their mood shifted and they would not come. They only stood in the doorway beside their mother, watching me. I scoffed. *Cats*.

Not a moment later, Mom came over, asking if we could talk. We sat on one of the steps of the back door stoop. She gave me a frank but watered down version of Mr. Voss’s story, then laid down the law. 

 “No playing in the pine rows, and no going outside for any reason after sunset. If you see something, anything, out of the ordinary- come tell myself or your father, immediately. Are we clear?”

“Yes ma’am.”

She asked if knew what to do if I was approached by a bear or a wolf, and I prattled off the steps to her. Don’t run. Back away slowly. If it approaches you, try to make yourself look big. All that. I can tell this relaxed her a bit, and she told me to have fun playing, and to be careful. 

The rest of the day was as pleasant as any day when you were 8. I ran aimlessly all over the yard, not much different from Mr Voss’s beagles. I stopped by the arbor to pick muscadine grapes. I helped Mom do some work in the flower beds, and before I knew it it was time to come inside. She threw a Disney movie into the small tube television in my room while she worked in the kitchen. Dad came in and washed up from doing yard work all day, the farmhouse’s old pipes groaning as he showered. We had dinner that night, I can’t recall what it was, but it was warm and I went back for seconds. After Dad and I cleaned the kitchen for Mom, we all sat at on the floor of the living room, playing Old Maid and talking by the fire. As the evening drew to a close, we all started getting ready for bed. 

That was the first night I saw the beast.

I remember it well. 

After I had given Dad a kiss and told him goodnight, Mom tucked me into bed under the fresh linens she had put on earlier that afternoon. She kissed my head reminding me to say my prayers before turning off the lights and closing the door, bidding me goodnight. 

Prayers said, I waited for sleep to overcome me but it never did. I tossed and turned for a while, before quietly sliding out of bed and slinking over to my window. The cats would always come out at night, and the view from outside of my bedroom window happened to be a particularly high traffic cat crossing. 

There were bushes beneath my window, and looking past them you could see paths that wound between and around garden beds brimming with various flowers and herbs. Behind them was the smallest of the barns that adorned the yard, Nanny had used it for storing gardening equipment and potting soil. It may have been geriatric, but it was a sturdy structure. It had survived an oak falling on it a couple years before and still stood tall. Behind it was a small stretch of field, and then the sea of pine rows.

I peered out of the antique, single pane glass. Keeping my breaths shallow as to not fog it up. I searched the shadows for cats, when my eye caught something in the distance. Deer occasionally appeared during these midnight matinees, strolling in the field or leaping through the pine rows. 

But this shape wasn’t moving like that.

The more I focused in on it, the more I saw that it was larger than I had thought. Larger than a deer. My sleepy brain began to dial in, seemingly aware that this was something outside of our routine viewing. I concentrated on the shape, holding my breath so as to ease my face as close to the glass as possible.

It prowled beneath the branches, its spine arched, its limbs creeping like a spider. Slow, deliberate movements, its ashen form lurked in the dark obscurity of the pine rows. It horrified me to think that if I hadn’t been deliberately looking at it, I could have cast a glance out the window and not even noticed it. 

Being that I was child, I did what any child might do. In my horror, I hyperventilated and broke into tears. I went running into my parents’ room. Desperate and pitiful, trying to explain to them what I saw. Mom was quick to fall into her maternal instincts, holding me close, wiping away my tears and stroking my hair. My Dad rubbed my back to comfort me, but his mind had gone back to the discussion with Mr Voss. 

“Did you see its face honey? Did it look like a bear?”

I quickly shook my head, eyes still wet with tears. 

“No- no it wasn’t a bear. It was too… too tall and long. A- a bear would be… less- gangly. This wasn’t. And it didn’t have any fur. It was-”

The more I thought back on the beast the more scared I became, all over again, until I burst into tears. I buried my face into my mother’s shoulder.

“It was so awful,” I sobbed, 

“I just want it to never come back.” 

My parents exchanged sympathetic looks. I slept in bed with them that night.



The next day was business as usual. In the morning after breakfast I helped Mom with some chores and then was released into the yard to play. I rode my bike up and down the dirt driveway while I listened to my Walkman. Mom watched me from the front porch while she mended some of Dad’s overalls. After a while she called me to help her again in the garden. We watered and weeded until it was time for lunch. Mom made grilled cheese and tomato soup. Dad came in, just having finished weed-eating, so he was a little dirty and peppered with blades of grass. We talked and ate and joked around. It wasn’t until Mom and I were doing the dishes that I noticed that Dad had vanished.

“Where’s Dad?” I asked, a little incredulously, at the absence of my dishwashing partner.

Mom’s eyes never left her work as she spoke, 

“He’s meeting Mr Voss.”

“Why?”

“Just to check out the Pine Rows”

She said nonchalantly. I didn’t press her about it, I knew they were out searching for dead animals.

Dad didn’t return until it was nearly dinner time. He didn’t say hey, he didn’t go to the kitchen for something to drink, he went straight to the shower. I could hear the pipes from my bedroom. During dinner, Dad seemed tired, but he put on a tired smile, asking me about my day and what all Mom and I had been up to. I had a feeling he didn’t want me to ask about his day, so I blabbed about everything Mom and I had done, how the cats were acting, and the songs I listened to on my Walkman. After we ate, I asked if I could go watch a movie in my room until lights out. My parents eagerly obliged. 

I sat cross legged on my bed, pretending to watch the Black Cauldron, I saw Dad pass my bedroom door. I tiptoed over, peaking my head out, watching him make his way wearily through the house and out to the front porch. I heard the pipes creak and knew Mom would be joining him shortly. 

Sensing an interesting conversation on the horizon, I took up a hiding spot near a coat rack by the front door, with a great view out the window and onto the front porch. I watched as Dad fell back into a rocking chair, exhausted. He packed and lit his briar pipe. The sky bore pearly hues of blush and lilac as it laid the day to rest. Dad leaned back, the embers in his pipe akin to the glow of the sunset as he took a long deep pull, exhaling a swirling plume of smoke.

I ducked down as Mom walked by. Her skin still rosey from her hot shower. Her hair was thrown up in a bun, and all her makeup was off. But she was more beautiful than the dusk sky, and Dad’s eyes corroborated my opinion. 

She met his gaze with a gentle smile, joining him in an adjacent rocking chair with a glass of wine in one hand and a beer in another. 

“I saw your bloody jeans in the hamper. I assume you had a 'work boots' kind of day.” She said with a weak laugh.

Dad scoffed. Mom always teased him for wearing the same pair of very-off-white New Balances all the time. She used to make comments to me on the days she saw them sitting by the back door, saying that he must be out doing dirty work. 

“You and Dan found an animal out there today?”

“Multiple.” Dad replied, his pipe hanging from the corner of his mouth as he cracked open his beer. 

“Two deer, a coyote, and a bobcat. We buried one of the deer and the bobcat. The rest of them were decayed enough or out of the way enough that we said ‘to hell with it.’”

Mom pensively said nothing.

“Dan called his game warden buddy, kind of a jack-ass, in my opinion. He told us to get photographic evidence. So Dan snapped some photos, said he’s gonna get ‘em developed tomorrow afternoon.”

The were a few lingering moments of silence until Mom spoke, asking softly,  

“What had happened to them?”

I heard Dad’s pipe clack between his teeth after taking another pull. By then the woody aroma had drifted into the house from under the front door. The smell of his tobacco was earthy, rich and sweet. He paused, taking a swig of his beer before answering. 

“A few of the deer seemed to have recently rotted down to their skeletons. Lots of their bones were broken, so we couldn’t quite put together what had happened to them; and ya’ know the vultures had probably gotten to ‘em and moved stuff around too. The coyote carcass was maybe a month old, it looked something had put a bunch of weight down on its ribs and crushed it. The bobcat-“

Dad stopped for a moment, as if remembering in awe.

“The bobcat was fresh Lori, real fresh. Past 24 hours fresh.”

“Oh my God, Peter.”

“It was a big one too. We found it at the base of a black walnut tree. It looked like it’s spine had been snapped against the trunk, and then something just-“ dad gestured with his hands, digging at the air. Sparing the gory details.

“All the blood on my clothes was from the Bobcat.”

“Well, thank God we didn’t let Amy play in the pine rows yesterday, how far was it from the house?”

“It was near the back of the rows, towards the woods. After we found and buried it we decided to call it quits for the day, but we’ll finish tomorrow, Dan said he’d help me.”

“Finish?”

“Yeah, we only got halfway around the pines, Lori. We still have to look around the other half tomorrow.”

The quiet returned for a few moments. Hanging in the air with the smoke from Dad’s pipe.

“Lori, don’t let Amy out of your sight.” I saw Mom nodding her head.

“I’m gonna keep the Benelli by the back door, it’s the semi-automatic, I remember you said you felt comfortable with that one. And I’m gonna keep the thirty-thirty, the Marlin, by the front door. I doubt it would just come up to the house in broad daylight, but I want you to be prepared in case I’m not here at the house with you.”

“That’s a good idea. And I think when Amy plays outside I need to tell her to stay in view of the windows. So you or I can see her.”

“Okay, good thinking. And we’ll need to ask her not to have her Walkman on her ears while she’s out there. I don’t want something sneaking up on her.”

Mom scoffed, “She’s not gonna like that.”

“Nah, she’s smart. If we explain it to her I’m sure she’ll understand.”

I didn’t like that. 

But I knew as well as they did that I would, in all likelihood, comply. Mom and Dad were reasonable, so I usually did.

“I know this is all scary for her- shit, it’s scary for all of us.”

“What the hell do you think this thing is Peter?”

 Dad let out a long exasperated sigh, as though he’d been asking himself that very thing all day. “The best thing I can figure is a bear. A very, very large bear. But who knows, I mean, we looked, but we didn’t see any tracks or scat or anything.”

“There were no tracks near the path? Even near the bobcat?”

Dad shook his head, “Too many pine needles. I mean years and years worth. We saw indentions in the earth under them, but nothing we could decipher.”

Dad finished his beer, setting it down on the ground by his rocking chair.

“Tomorrow, Dan’s gonna help me check the second half of the pine rows. He said one day next week he could send his nephews out on their four wheelers to check the woods that back up to the river.”

“Oh gosh is that safe?”

“It’s been a few years but those little rascals are grown, they’re young men now, they’re almost as tall as Dan.”

Mom hummed, not convinced, but opting to move on. “That’s nice of Dan to help you.”

“Yeah, he didn’t ask for anything but I told him I’d throw him and his nephews some cash for the help. I wish I could say I was hopeful, but I worry what those boys might find out there.”

I heard one of their rocking chairs creak as they moved to stand up, so I quietly scurried back off to my room. My parents didn’t bring it up to me that night or ever, didn’t say anything about it at all. Likely fearful that I would have another “nightmare.”



The last day, Sunday afternoon, Mom and I did the laundry and packed our things. The packing didn’t take long. We left most of our stuff behind, seeing that we would be back next weekend. Once I had my little red and white polka dot duffle bag tucked in the trunk of her station wagon Mom told me I could play until we left in a couple of hours. I climbed my favorite tree, an oak near the back door that Dad had nailed wooden steps onto. Mom sat outside with me, folding laundry. I finished my Goosebumps book, so I examined my pockets and discovered a long screw. Lord know where I’d found it or why I’d picked it up but I decided it was time to carve my initials into a tree. 

Mom and I both heard the phone in the house ring, so she hopped up to get it. Probably Aunt Cheryl. She had been meaning to stop by that weekend but Mom had told her it wasn’t a great time. While carving an “A” from way up in the tree I saw Dad coming over from the shop barn. It was the largest of the barns, and Papa had used it as a workshop. From the shade of the enormous oak beside the barn, it looked like Dad had grabbed a rag, using it to wipe something on his shirt. As he stepped out into the light I could see that it was blood. Red, fresh.

Dad didn’t see me in the tree, so he didn't put on any heirs. He pulled his baseball cap off and wiped the sweat on his forehead with his arm. For a busy-body who normally took such long purposeful strides, his steps were slow. Heavy. His face was so white. His eyes were locked onto the ground in front of him as he walked. My dad looked scared. 

Mom tried to covertly put his dirty clothes in a bag while Dad showered and got changed. I didn’t say anything. Dad didn’t know I’d seen him, and Mom thought I was none the wiser. We turned off all the lights, locked all the doors, and then hit the road for home. Looking out my window at the lush greenery of the countryside that had so enamored me only days before, I couldn’t help but think now that it only acted as a shroud, a living, flowering veil that hid the beast lurking within. 



Back at home in the sardine can of suburbia, any moment absent of conscious thought was overcome with visions of the beast. If I had been any older, it would have been an easy write off, *“its just a nightmare,” “you’re crazy,” “go see a psychologist;”* but I wasn’t. I was an 8 year old little girl who read mythology encyclopedias and fairy tale compendiums like I was going for a PhD. I actively side stepped mushroom rings for fear of being kidnapped by the fae. A small piece of every Little Debbie cake I got was left near the crawl space door in case we had hobgoblins or brownies living under our house (which at the time, I seriously suspected we did).

My parents, the logic-bound adults could chock it all up to a subconscious presentation of a fear response, but I didn’t want to lie to myself.

I knew what I saw. 

As harrowing as it was, I kept mulling it over in my mind. Turning it over, rotating it at different angles, all in hopes of better understanding what it really was- the devil outside my bedroom window. If I was acting spacey, my friends at school didn’t say anything, at least not to my face. In the hallway, at lunch, at P.E. It possessed my every thought. 

The list of things I didn’t know about it was infinite, so I started with what I did know about it. 

It was large. Tall. I tried to think of it in comparison to the pines, and in doing so I stumbled upon a memory. It was a year before Nanny died, I was small, but not small enough to forget. It was the last time she was able to walk the pine rows with me. Her hair was as white as her sweet little farmhouse, and her bones burled and bent with age. Her voice was as gentle as the rustle in the pine needles. She said that because the pines were all planted so close together, the lowest of the branches wouldn’t get enough sunlight. As a result, they would drop off while the higher branches would reach upwards to take in more sunlight. I remember her smiling, as if that fact meant something to her.

She said that Papa had measured, and most of the branches in the pine rows were 5-7 feet from the ground. 

With that information at my disposal. I did some guesswork, but my safe guess was that it had been at least 4 feet, or probably more like 5 feet tall, on all fours.

It’s torso and appendages were lean. Not stocky, like a bear’s. Bears weren’t built that way. Why was I still thinking about bears? It definitely wasn’t a bear. What features I did see resembled a wolf, but wolves weren’t that large, that hairless, or that lanky. Neither were bears. My head began to throb. Whatever small annoying part of my brain *had* started developing was trying desperately to compare it to what I knew to be real. Thankfully the rest of my mind was fantastical and thought mermaids existed, so instead of having a psychological breakdown like an adult, I came to grips with the fact that this beast was a wolf-like and in all likelihood a werewolf. But I needed to do some research.  

That day after school, I asked Mom to take me to the library, a request she was used to. On the car ride there, she asked me what kind of book I was going to look for. So I explained my werewolf theory to her. A decision I immediately regretted when I saw the pity and concern within her eyes in the rear view mirror. 

“Honey, I know we’ve talked about all of this with the fairies and the mermaids and the unicorns, but werewolves aren’t real honey. I love that you have such a vivid imagination, but you’ve got to be realistic. I mean, sure, it might have been that bear or wolf out in the woods, but it was probably just a nightmare-“

“It couldn’t be a nightmare, I was at the window, and I know what I saw! It wasn’t normal looking- It didn’t look like a bear or a wolf, it was something else. I’m 100% sure that I saw what I saw! Mom, I swear- I swear I’m not lying.”

I saw the pained deliberation in her eyes. Outside of my fascination and proclivity for fairy stories I was pretty practical for my age. I listened to Mom and Dad when they told me things, I was forthcoming and honest if I did something I wasn’t supposed to. I wouldn’t blatantly lie to my Mom, and she knew that.

“Well, then, baby… if you really did see what you think you saw then- well, then it must have been a nightmare. And you’ve slept walked before! You know you were probably just sleep walking, had a nightmare, and woke at the window.”

My brow furrowed, taking what my mom said into consideration but not able to convince myself. I stared out the window in deep thought until we pulled up to the library.

Once we arrived, I didn’t have to worry about trying to give my Mom the slip. My love of books and stories came from her, and she made a B-line for the mystery section. Despite her dismissal of my werewolf theory, she loved spooky stories. 

  After collecting a few books from the sections labeled “folklore” and “nature science,” I found an empty table and started to read. I skimmed through a couple of books on mythology and American folklore and the like, none of its pages revealing any groundbreaking revelations. Silver bullets, transformation under the light of the moon, all the usual factoids. What was highly informative, however, was the expository book on wolves. 

How fast they were, how much power and stamina they possessed, how strong their bite was, how sharp their eyes were, how keen their sense of smell was; all the things that made them great hunters. I kept in mind that this was all a baseline for this creature. At the *very least* it did all these things. The thought overcame me with dread. I didn’t exactly calculate the metrics, but I knew that this monster likely doubled if not tripled anything a wolf could do. 

Knowing that time was running out before Mom came to fetch me, I ran over to the children’s section and grabbed a Junie B. Jones book I hadn’t read yet, as well as the newest Goosebumps book.

When I approached Mom, I tried to hide my wolf book under my selection of age appropriate literature, but Lori didn’t miss a thing.

“Study of the American Wolf, huh?”

I tried to brush past her comment and critical side eye,

“I thought you said I needed to be more realistic. Wolves are real, aren’t they?”

She sighed, rolling her eyes, handing it and my other books over to the librarian for check out. 



That evening at home, we had finished dinner and cleared the dining room table to play Jenga. The phone rang, and Dad stepped out of the room and into the kitchen to take it. Dad answered in a hushed tone, keeping his voice down. Unfortunately for Dad, he wasn’t a great whisperer. 

“Hey Dan… find any-?…How many…?” 

Silence. For a long while, silence. Mom and I locked eyes.

“God… Yeah, I see. Thank the boys for me… I’ll pay em for all their help… we both know that’s a lot of work. So sorry they had to… yeah… well… my God… I don’t know either, man… Yeah… Yeah… Thanks again Dan.”

Dad returned, doing his best to hide the weary look on his face. He glanced over at my Mom, and then at me, giving me a smile. I smiled back timidly. 

I looked back and forth between Mom and Dad, as she gave him a look that said, *‘You know she heard all that, right?’*

Dad hummed, pursing his lips in a wry way. I couldn’t help but laugh at him. But the quiet that followed it sobered the moment.

""Amy,” My Dad paused as he weighed his words. “Your old man… is an awful whisperer.”

“Yeah, you kind of are.” I snickered.

“I know you’re a smart girl, even if you didn’t just hear me on the phone, I know that you know that some scary stuff is going on right now.”

I nodded. Dad sat back down at the table, folding his hands as he spoke.

“But I want you to know that while we’re at the farm, you aren’t in any danger as long as you listen to what your mother and I say. Follow the rules, stay in the yard, and don’t go into the pine rows. I don’t want this to cause you too much distress, because none of this is going to last forever. 

Mr Voss, myself and some other people in the community are getting evidence together, and filling paperwork out- which is stupid- but we are doing it to see if we can get the game warden or someone from DNR involved. Whoever ends up helping us, they will know what to do. Its their job, that my taxes pay for by the way, and the fact that they haven’t sent someone out already is-“

Mom kicked Dad under the table. Dad cleared his throat. 

“The point is, whatever this thing is, a bear, a wolf, its just wandered too far out of its habitat. Whenever someone from the state *does* get out there, they’ll either capture it or kill it or do whatever they have to to keep people safe, to keep us safe.” 

I nodded again with a small smile. I thought it was sweet that Mom and Dad were trying to keep my spirits up, especially when I could tell all of this weighed on them so heavily. 

I tried to lighten the mood a little bit, the way any 8 year old girl would, by being a little snarky.

“So, what will we do if the game warden looks at everything and says its a werewolf?” I said. 

To me it was only kind of a joke, but to Mom and Dad it was ridiculous, and that was all that mattered. Dad smirked.

“Ah yes, your mother told me all about your werewolf theory.”

“Well, what if it is?” I crossed my arms, making a face that wrinkled my nose.

Dad put on a gravely serious look, laying it on thick. 

“If it is, I’ll just have to melt down your mother’s silver dinnerware set into bullets.”

“Oh no you won’t! That set is an heirloom!” 

Dad dramatically lifted his hands, dropping them back down on the table in defeat.

“Well then, I guess your mother is just going to let us all die,”

Mom and I cracked up. Dad attempted to remain dry but the corners of his mouth crept up into a smile. 

“We’ll just have to try and stab the thing with silver butter knives. That’ll show ‘em.”

We cut-up for the rest of the evening, our hearts full of mirth as we turned in for the night. None of us spoke about it again for the rest of the week. But it festered in our minds, leaked into every unoccupied moment. I could see the apprehension buried in their eyes when they were lost in thought, driving, cooking dinner, staring out the window. I lied awake in bed every night, counting down the days until Friday, when we returned to the farm.

Like I said in my previous post: I stumbled upon this sub not too long ago, and it felt like I found gold as it feels like so many spaces on Reddit revolve around hookups, but I’ve always been drawn to something softer: genuine closeness, comfort, and the warmth of touch. 

I’m looking for an ideally ongoing connection built on affection and mutual comfort. The kind of bond where holding someone close after a long day feels like hitting pause on the world for a while. I love long snuggles, slow kisses, lazy hugs, gentle head pats, hand-holding, and quiet moments that say more than words ever could. Kisses, to me, are reaffirming and affectionate: more about warmth and closeness than necessarily something purely sexual.

Lately, work’s been burning me out, and all of my close friends have moved away for new opportunities. This has made life to be sometimes very depressing and lonely. As we Vancouverites like to say, our city’s beautiful, but often lonely and I think cuddles could fix that for me

About me: 
I’m 28, brown-skinned, 5’10”, clean, hygienic, and respectful — with a body built for cuddles: what I’d call a beefy dad bod, though I’ve been working out daily lately (currently cutting). And apparently, I have a great smile too… not just according to my dentist!

When it comes to comfort, I’m big on consent and communication. I like to check in about boundaries, even for simple things like hugging or kissing. I want you to always feel safe, seen, and in control.

As for me — my biggest passion is guitar 🎸. I’ve got four of them and love covering my favorite bands like Polyphia and others. Hugely into music (grew up listening to a lot of Y2K era bands) 
I game casually (mostly the big Riot titles rn— pls don’t judge, I’m not competitive ). 
I love cooking and think friendly cook-offs are a fun activity with a friend. 
I’m into movies, shows, and anime — some shonen, thrillers, rom-coms, and slice-of-life are my favorites. 

I’m 420-friendly, but only socially it’s fun to get a little stoned and laugh endlessly with good company. Not a dealbreaker

At my core, I’m an affectionate person who enjoys being around someone I can both laugh and be vulnerable with. If you’ve been feeling that same quiet loneliness, maybe we can make this city feel a little less lonely— one warm cuddle at a time. 💛

Lastly: I’m able to host usually, and definitely able to be hosted too. Definitely would like to meet publicly for a coffee or something before my first time hosting

Shoot me a message and let’s see how we flow from there :) maybe we can exchange face pics first

Africa isn’t only about breathtaking landscapes or wildlife; it’s about people, stories, and traditions that run deep.
Every dance, every drumbeat, and every color in the clothes people wear has a story behind it one that’s been passed down for generations.

From the powerful rhythm of West African drums
To the proud Maasai traditions in Kenya
To the soulful art and storytelling across South Africa

Every part of Africa has its own way of celebrating life through music, food, language, and connection.

There’s something raw and real about the culture here. It’s warm, expressive, and deeply human.

If you could experience one African culture up close, which one would it be?
Would you dive into the energy of Nigerian Afrobeats, the craftsmanship of Morocco, mo the spirit of Zulu dance, or the calm of Ethiopian coffee rituals?

Okay, real talk — does anyone else feel like finding a real connection in LA is harder than finding parking downtown on a Friday night?

I’m a 30-year-old curvy Mexican Latina who’s lived in DTLA long enough to know that everyone’s “looking for something real”… until it’s time to communicate, make plans, or show effort. 🙃

So here I am, writing this, hoping maybe one genuine, emotionally intelligent human will read it and think, “Wait — she gets it.”

I’m not looking for something rushed or surface-level. I’ve done my healing, built my peace, and learned that love isn’t about chaos — it’s about comfort, communication, and someone who actually shows up.

I’m the type who’ll listen when you talk, remember the little things, and make you laugh in between deep conversations about life and whatever random thing just popped into our heads.
But I also value peace — so if you’re still tangled up in an ex, figuring out your feelings, or in a complicated situation with a kid’s mom… I’m not the person to step into that. I want something calm, consistent, and built on mutual respect.

Here’s a little snapshot of my vibe:
	•	I’m happiest sipping an iced latte at a local coffee shop, people-watching or chatting about everything and nothing.
	•	Farmers markets, cozy bookstores, small art galleries — yes, I’ll linger too long and touch every candle.
	•	I love live music, street tacos, beach sunsets, and the kind of laughter that makes your cheeks hurt.
	•	And if a dog walks by? Sorry, I’ll be talking to them before I remember to finish my sentence. 🐶

I don’t drive right now, so I stick close to DTLA — but honestly, there’s so much to do nearby if you’re creative and a little spontaneous: picnics at Vista Hermosa, rooftop coffee dates, comedy nights, late-night donut runs… if you can hold a good conversation, the rest is easy.

I’m looking for someone in their 30s or 40s who’s emotionally grounded, affectionate, and knows what they want. Someone who’s done the growing and healing — not perfect, just self-aware.
The kind of man who texts back, listens with intention, and makes you feel safe just by being himself.

If that sounds like you, send a few photos and tell me a bit about yourself — not the résumé version, but the real one. What makes you laugh? What do you love doing when no one’s watching? What’s your favorite random LA spot?

💬 My first message will be this post, just to make sure we’re aligned before jumping into conversation — because let’s be honest, emotional compatibility > fake chemistry every time.

If you’re someone who still believes in showing up, laughing often, loving softly, and talking like you mean it — I think we’ll get along just fine. 💞",3,1761873262.0,u_positive-vibe-chaser,0,1.0,False

1okhc9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1okhc9w/does_anyone_else_hoard_things/,Does anyone else hoard things?,"my OCD manifests itself in a lot of ways, but most recently its been the fear of running out of things i need. I think its called scarcity anxiety. since i was about 10 ive been collecting and hiding pantry stable foods in my bedroom closet, but its beyond that recently. Its stupid, but it kicked off a few months ago when i ran out of my favorite deodorant, because the brand stopped selling it in that scent, and it spiraled from there. the fear that things i like/need might suddenly be gone without a backup. and inflation also freaks me out and makes it worse; the thought that things will keep getting expensive, but if i buy a bunch of it now instead of waiting, i can potentially save money (and the scarcity relates to money, too… which is ironic because im currently unemployed. its as anxiety inducing as it sounds)

anyways, thats all to say that today my package for 6 sets of shampoo and conditioner came today, and i was making a cart to buy 4 body washes and twin packs of deodorant and boxes of tampons when i was starting to think… well, this probably isn’t normal. i also do this with food. im in possession of about 10 tubs of Talenti gelato (yeah it was as expensive as it sounds), half pistachio and half cold brew coffee flavor because im 1 million years old. and sooo much ground coffee. cleaning products, too; i probably raised Method’s stock value all by myself buying their all purpose cleaning sprays

sorry for rambling! was just wondering if anyone could relate. what do you hoard, if you do? anything specific? thank you :)",8,1761872937.0,OCD,3,0.91,False

No smile, no wave, nothing.

One rainy evening, I noticed his trash bin had tipped over, spilling everything into the street. I picked it up and dragged it back to his porch before heading home. Didn’t think much of it.

The next morning, I opened my door to find a steaming cup of coffee and a sticky note that said:

>

That small gesture turned everything around. Now, every morning when I leave for work, he’s out there waiting coffee in one hand, waving with the other.

It’s crazy how something as simple as helping with trash turned into a neighborly friendship. Sometimes, kindness doesn’t need words just quiet actions that speak loud.",10,1761872867.0,story,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Vancouver Canucks vs. St. Louis Blues: A Tale of Two Teams, Both Struggling, But Only One Can Lose**

**Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You Didn’t Sign Up For**  
The St. Louis Blues are listed at **-148** (implied probability: \~59.7%) while the Vancouver Canucks sit as **+124** underdogs (\~44.6%). If you’re confused by the overlap, don’t worry—bookmakers love to overcharge for the privilege of scratching your head. The total goals line is a bloated **6.5**, suggesting bettors should prepare for a shootout. But with both teams reeling, it’s more likely we’ll get a game where the puck looks lost in a desert.

**Team News: Injuries, Prospects, and the NHL’s Version of Whac-A-Mole**  
The Canucks are playing with the offensive potency of a team that forgot its skates. **Quinn Hughes** (their Norris Trophy-caliber defenseman) and **Conor Garland** (their sparkplug winger) are out, leaving Vancouver’s attack to rely on **Lukas Reichel**, a rookie center acquired in a trade, and **Tom Willander**, a 20-year-old prospect making his NHL debut. Imagine handing a kid a chainsaw and telling him to fix your car—entertaining, but not advisable.

The Blues? They’re the NHL’s version of a leaky dam. Their **5-on-5 save percentage (.856)** is worse than a sieve at a bakery, and starter **Jordan Binnington** has a .863 save percentage this season. Yet, they’re favored. Why? Because Vancouver’s goaltender, **Thatcher Demko**, has a career .910 save percentage against St. Louis, which sounds good until you realize it’s still worse than a coffee machine’s consistency.
