1g5epu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1g5epu1/i_wasnt_expecting_transphobes_at_a_chappell_roan/,I wasn't expecting transphobes at a Chappell Roan show :/,"I'm having a rough time right now and need to vent, but could also probably use some advice if anyone cares to read my long post.

Background is I'm coming up on nine months hrt and finally seeing some real changes. I've been socially transitioning with family and friends but not work yet. I mostly boy mode in public. I've been presenting femme in safe spaces such as trans socials, gay bars, queer coffee shops, and raves. I've been getting more confident and felt ready to fully transition soon.

So I got a ticket for a music fest and didn't have anyone to go with. I was mainly going to see Chapell Roan, Dom Dolla, and Sturgill Simpson. I dressed pretty androgynous with short shorts, tank top, sneakers. However this being a Chapell show I femmed it up a bit with jewelry and some light makeup. I really wasn't expecting a bunch of transphobes.

At Chapell there was this teenage girl just staring a hole in me. Then the looks from a group of teens in front of me. Looks of fear and disgust. I moved around a bit and ended up near some people who seemed cool and enjoyed the show. One lady smiled and blew me a kiss.

At Dom Dolla it was a much cooler crowd. I found a crew flying a rainbow flag and hung out by them. Mostly positive interactions but I dis get some puzzled looks from even the guys. The beautiful women dancing with the guys rolled her eyes at me.

Now Sturgill is country but he is liberal and sings about psychedelics and such. I guess the church ladies didn't get the memo. This one lady was giving me the death stare. She was so angry that I would dare stand within site of her children. Tells her husband, then they are both staring. Another couple looks upset with my presence and walk away.

Now I was on some substances that had me looking all sweaty like I'm on drugs, bit I really don't think that was it. It's just crazy how I could wear the same outfit on boymode no problem. The minute I do my eyebrows and put on some eye liner people freak the fuck out.

I then made the mistake of meeting a friend at a strait club. It was EDM so I thought it would be a cool crowd. Well no it was bros and Debbie's, and boy did they hate me being there. Again you have a guy selling merchandise who is super nice and the bartender, she's super cool and friendly. Literally everyone else there was sending bad vibes in one way or another.

I get that I wasn't making much effort to pass. I couldn't even if I tried. I try not to make passing the end all goal but I would like to get there. However this experience has left me feeling like I'd never want to be stealth. I hate these horrible transphobes and I don't want anything to do with them anymore. If I was passing I could go in that club and maybe the same people would want to be around me. I wouldn't even know how they are such horrible people. 

After that I wanted some affirmation and found a guy on Grindr to hook up with. Increadibly he was really sweet and cool. We had sex and then lay there cuddling. It seemed to be going well when he suddenly gets up at 5:30 AM saying he has to get ready for work. He can't be rid of me fast enough and his whole demeanor had changed. It was awkward as I said ""maybe we can do this again some time"" and left. He blocked me as soon as I left.

It definitely hasn't made me question transition. I am loving life far too much despite the difficulties to ever let anyone take this from me. It's probably a good idea to stop hooking up with probable chasers though.",1,1729126032.0,MtF,0,1.0,False

I used to have mildToxic masculinity in 2021 when I didn't apply any lotion or creams on my skin because I believed that soft hands or skin in general was very feminine.

I gave in eventually when my face was so fucking flaked on the eyebrow part and it was very itchy in general. I concluded that soft skin isn't feminine after I started using lotions for better feeling skin. I remember how dry and chapped my shit fucking skin used to be in the past and I just want to say that I'm not that kind of Man anymore.

I only thought this because most of the lotions were for Women in general or advertised by them. Especially body butter but now I want the coffee scented body butter.

I only made this post because I keep putting lotion on my hands and arms and ears and face in general..... but 2-4 days later it goes back to slowly being dry again like it always is. Per usual the only fix is applying more.

I can't use aloe vera because that gives me acne and I had to find out the hard way. 'Organic' oils are not for faces because they are very comedogenic and cause an outbreak due to being heavy oils. Oils such as; olive, avocado and castor oils are heavy pore cloggers of the skin. Its only intended use in cosmetic purpose is for hair but I don't see why anyone would do this.

I don't buy denatured oils because it's just crap that's been mixed in to save on company profitts.",1,1729125747.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

Drank coffee while holding the baby (even when I told her repeatedly not to), wrapped her like it was deep winter during a very hot summer, used napkin/tissue papers to wipe my baby's face, intimidated me each time I got near my daughter, held my daughter 24/7, gossiped and spoke behind me & my family's backs. It ended up in really big fights even though we don't speak the same language. Everyone coming against me, including my husband.

His family owns this place so there is no longer a risk of homelessness. The place is smaller than my previous rental, and already busy as it was. And because we had two sets of everything, I had to get rid of most of my stuff. It felt like I had to dissemble my whole life to join him, and although he was willing to change a few things, it still doesn’t feel like my home. 

I complained on a couple of occasions how uncomfortable the place is. For example, the bathroom shower has very low pressure, to the point I don’t feel clean after a shower. The taps are all leaking unless left in a specific angle. The vanity cannot fit a hairdryer. The list goes on. He hated to hear these complaints, and said he couldn’t do anything about them anyway. Eventually I managed to fix the shower pressure myself, at least to a functional level, by removing the water saving thing inside the showerhead. 

I think that’s where our communication started to break down, and it kept getting worse. 

I have a certain set of cleaning / tidying standards, mostly to ensure nothing hazardous is left out for my cat. Things like making sure there are no spices on the countertop, no onions in the sink, no food scraps dropped on the sofa, no coffee grounds spilled. I have obviously told him firmly that these things are unacceptable, but already on a few occasions I found him leaving something bad out. I don’t think it was intentional, just a lack of consciousness. Generally I find myself constantly cleaning after him. If I leave early morning for gym, i cannot go straight to work afterwards. Instead I have to come back to check that he has left things in order, and often clean after his breakfast. It’s mentally exhausting. 

He is also going through a rough patch at work. I know he is under a lot of stress, and he js not managing it well. He would only talk to me in a dumbed down way, with little context, even though I’m in the same field and fully capable of understanding. Often though, he comes home stressed out, goes straight to his computer, breathes heavily and occasionally yells something in frustration. In these situations if I approach him to ask what’s wrong, he will almost certainly ignore me. He will also refuse to participate in any chores, even if they are urgent, and so I’m forced to pick up the slack. I can tell my cat is scared, and myself a little bit too. I grew up with an abusive parent and the signs are just so similar. That said, I do believe he’s a good person and won’t be violent. So I wonder if it’s mostly a me problem. 

Yesterday I tried to bring up these concerns, as calmly as I could. But as I learned later “it was a really bad time for him” due to reasons that did not seem substantial or stressful to me. And before I could really get my message across, he took some word I said out of context, and started ranting. His voice completely drowned out me and made me shiver and cry. He yelled about the amount of chores he does around the house, and how he has to clean after me all the time, and I’m double standard. My original agenda was about not leaving toxic food out and risk my cats health, but he would not let me speak a word. Later when he calmed down, he reflected “word for word” what he heard I said, and it was so far from truth. 

I feel physically and mentally exhausted. Since moving here I have not slept well, because I naturally need more hours of sleep, but he gets up very early and does all the loud chores, like emptying the dishwasher, as loudly as he could. I also can never rest assured about cat safety and so that mental load is always there. I sacrifice my work hours so I can leave home after him, and get back before him, to have that peace of mind. I have tried so hard to communicate and improve but I just seem to hit a wall. 

We had been looking to buy our home together, but after yesterday I don’t think that’s a good idea anymore. I should also say that most of the deposit would come from me. He has none and would only help increase our borrowing capacity. I could buy a smaller place myself and be financially comfortable. Does that make sense? And what does our future look like then?

1g5eg2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/StraightTransGirls/comments/1g5eg2t/how_i_know_my_amazing_boyfriend_loves_me_as_a/,How I know my amazing boyfriend loves me as a woman,"I'm trying to counterbalance the doom.

My background:

* I am pretty and passing, but still clocky since I'm only 2 years on hormones. People don't usually guess that I am trans, but they are rarely visibly stunned when I tell them. It's an ""okay, I can see it"" vibe I generally get when I disclose.
* I am white, very educated, and work in academia.
* I'm perpetually broke and have rarely made a living income, but I can afford a decent life as long as I'm frugal.
* I am twice divorced from women whom I tended to live vicariously through.
* I am dedicated to making the most of my transition, but my insurance won't cover any surgery. So I got laser, voice trained, took hormones, and do bulking and cutting cycles in the gym to improve my figure.

His background:

* He's cis, stable, reliable, strong, fit, charming, fun, caring, honest, and willing to be vulnerable.
* He's been through a lot. His dad died of cancer as a teen, and his family spiraled into opiate abuse thereafter. His stability was instrumental in their finally getting clean shortly before I met him. He was left with a belief that he is not good enough because he couldn't replace his father. He was also abused in the military when he was a very young man and still has injuries from it.After a medical discharge, he still worked a hard labor job because it enabled him to make enough money to take care of his family who were addled with addiction. He responded with his own dependency on alcohol that he is still weening himself away from.

Here are some ways I know he loves me:

* He texts every morning when he gets to work and every night before he goes to bed.
* He checks on me when he knows I am struggling.
* When I get out of bed in the morning to make coffee and he's still hazy but cuddling me, he sometimes whimpers as I leave his arms.
* Many attractive women in his life have crushes on him, some of whom are his type. Yet he chose me.
* He brags to his (working class) family about my advanced degrees. It's sweet, though it makes me uncomfortable because I think some of them feel intellectually intimidated by me now.

Here are some ways I know he sees me as a woman:

* He intentionally walks on the side of the street with the cars to protect me from them.
* He is bothered by the idea of me paying (though I refuse to entertain that patriarchal nonsense and he gets it).
* He sometimes forgets I'm trans and worries about getting me pregnant.
* He visibly shudders at the idea of me topping him.
* When we cuddle, he will caress my body while absent mindedly complimenting the femininity of my features.

Why I think he loves me in particular:

* I don't play games. I just want to love him. I should mention that it took me a long time to get to this point psychologically. My previous marriages were not great relationships even though we did love each other.
* I accept him exactly as he is and don't ask him to be anything more.
* I happily support what he wants for himself.
* We have a lot of shared interests and a similar sense of humor.
* I honestly just want to be a good person with healthy, loving relationships. I am always doing my best to become a better person. The striving is important. We're all fuckups in our own ways. But admitting that to ourselves and making a genuine effort to treat others better than we have before is very attractive.

When I was telling my therapist about him today, she said he sounded like an amazing person. I said I'm lucky to have him. Then she said, ""or maybe you're an amazing person also and you deserve each other.""

I'm telling you all this because I want you to know that, while you can't control being trans, there is a lot that is still in your control that affects the quality of person you will attract. Try to become the best version of yourself and you can attract someone who is amazing because he is doing the same.

**2. Mido Ocean Star GMT Special Edition:**

* ""Y'know, the wedding is at a beach resort. A dress watch might be too formal. A dive watch would be great, especially since I'm certified and will probably be diving. Plus, it's a destination wedding, so a GMT function will actually be useful. Yeah, this is a very practical choice.""

My first Swiss watch and my first watch over $500. These days, mostly unworn due to its size but I keep it running because I occasionally do like to wear it, even if it is too big for my wrist. But I have taken this watch diving! Definitely keeping it for the memories.

**3. Casio A700W-1A:**

* ""I still need a thin, slim dress watch. I'll just get this. It's cheap and fits the bill.""

These days, mostly unworn. I might give this one away to a friend who loves Casios and wants one with a better backlight.

**4. Omega Speedmaster Professional 3861, Sapphire Sandwich:**

* ""This has been my grail watch for over a decade AND I work for NASA now, too! It would be a travesty if I DIDN'T get this watch! Once I get it, I'm done!""

My current daily driver alongside the Tudor. Recently came back from a warranty service, and I was briefly worried I had fallen out of love with it because of the Tudor, but nope. It is still my #1 choice in the morning. Its main job is timing my coffee brews, which is obviously essential for work and mental wellbeing. This will be the watch I'm either buried with, or gifted to a future kid (but only if they end up working for NASA, too)

**5. Tudor Black Bay 58 GMT:**

* ""Man, my wrist feels empty without the Speedy Pro. And the Mido's dive bezel means it can only track two time zones. That's obviously unacceptable. I need a GMT with a 24-hour bezel. Plus, I need to convert UTC times for work, so it makes sense to get this watch!""

My newest acquisition, purchased during a trip abroad. It was my daily while my Speedy was being serviced, and I still wear it once every two or three days. And yes, I actually do use its bezel to convert UTC times for work, lol. It should be a business expense on my tax return, really....

I'm happy with my SOTC thus far. It might shrink down to just the middle three at some point in the near future, if I decide to thrift the Orient and give away the Casio. But I can already feel my brain concocting new lies to convince me to get another watch. I can feel Grand Seiko calling my name, telling me I need a dress watch with a unique movement....

PS: All the watches except the Orient were calibrated to my phone time on Monday. You can see how far each of them has drifted off based on the Casio's time.  :)

Gotta love those METAS movements, but the Mido is surprising me with how well it's keeping with the Speedy and Tudor.",2,1729124957.0,Watches,1,1.0,False

Quick Disclaimer: I know this is just a children's cartoon and isn't meant to be taken seriously. This, like the show itself, is not at all meant to be taken seriously or considered an actual critique of the show. It is all in good fun.
With that out of the way I present you, Everything Wrong With: The Egg!

**Nicole**: INSPECTION! *\[She walks up to Richard who is wearing a brown tuxedo\]* Hmm.  
**Richard**: Look honey, I still fit into my wedding tux! *\[He winces a little\]*  
**Nicole**: Richard, there's a mirror behind you.  
*\[Nicole points to the mirror, and as Richard steps away from it, it becomes quite clear that his suit is torn on the back, exposing his underwear\]*  
**Richard**: Aww, it never used to be there.  
**Richard would be good at CinemaSins +1**

**Gumball**: *\[Finger guns, with confidence\]* Respect yo!  
**Nicole**: No, I said you have to look respect-able. Just go put something sensible on.  
*\[Gumball walks off with a showy attitude, waving his arms and making the gold pieces shake audibly\]*  
**Shouldn't...shouldn't he be going upstairs if he needs to get changed? What does he intend to do in the living room, just will the new clothes onto himself from thin air? +5**

*\[Gumball puts his arms down and he hurries up. Nicole then moves on to examine Darwin, who isn't wearing anything. His feet are censored\]*  
**Nicole**: *\[Sighs\]* I said act natural, not *au naturel*.  
**Okay, I can get Gumball's misunderstanding, but this? Why the fuck would Nicole ever ask him to be naked for a guest coming over? +5**

*\[Darwin walks off, his fish feet making slapping noises on the floor. Nicole shifts her disappointed gaze at Anais who is wearing a mourning veil and black funeral dress. For a moment she looks angrily back in protest before beginning to doubt her outfit\]*  
**Anais**: Too serious?  
**Nicole**: I can understand this kind of stuff from them because, well... what's a nice way to put it... They're halfwits. But you're better than that! So could you *please* wear something sensible?  
**Anais**: No.  
**Why is Anais being so uncoperative with this right now? She has no idea who's coming over yet, so she has no reason to be against or upset by it. And it isn't like her to just randomly act out like this either +5**

**Nicole**: I can understand this kind of stuff from them because, well... what's a nice way to put it... They're halfwits.  
**What the fuck. Gumball and Darwin are almost definetely within earshot when she says this, yet she does it anyway. And even if they weren't this is still a pretty cruel thing to say about your own children +10**

*\[Gumball's combed hair suddenly stands up and looks like a mess\]*  
**Gumball**: Ugh, why do I have to do my hair like this? It's like trying to groom a coconut.  
**Since...since when does Gumball have hair? +1**

**Nicole**: *\[Vexed\]* If in doubt, do exactly the opposite of what you'd normally do. Am I clear?  
**Anais**: No! Who's coming over?  
**She got them to do all of this without even telling them who exactly was coming over? That seems like some pretty important information to withhold +1**

**Nicole**: *\[Stressed\]* So for once can we please pretend we are not a bunch of savages who- Richard, stop picking your nose with your toes!  
*\[Richard has a toe stuck in his nose\]*  
**Richard**: But you said to get my *finger* out of my nose!  
*\[Felicity and Billy are seen standing outside the door, confused at what they're hearing\]*  
**Nicole**: *\[Unseen, shouting behind the door\]* I didn't think I'd have to explain every-  
**This is Richard you're talking about. Of course you'd have to. +1**

*\[Felicity rings the doorbell. Nicole opens the door, leaning forward with a complete change of attitude, smiling\]*  
**Nicole**: *\[Pleasantly\]* Oh, welcome Felicity.  
**Felicity**: I prefer Miss Parham.  
**Nicole**: Sorry, you can call me Mrs. Watterson.  
**Felicity**: Of course... *\[Mockingly, from behind her smiling teeth\]* Nicole.  
**Oh my god I already hate her. These kind of people are the absolte worst spawns of satan imaginable +50**

*\[Nicole turns to said family. Felicity glances at the four Wattersons, who are nervously bunched together and smiling back at her. She takes a step back, gaping with horror and disgust, the moment complete with a strong pipe organ chord playing in the background\]\[Felicity flashes back to a scene from ""The Hero"" as dramatic music plays\]*  
**Richard**: *\[Dancing in front of the mall as Felicity, Billy and the crowd stare in horror\]* Oh, Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh, Ohh!  
*\[Then to a scene from ""The Authority""\]*  
**Felicity**: Don't worry Billy, it's a really good hospi—*\[Runs into Gumball, whose face was slightly flattened\]* TAAAAAAAL!!!  
*\[And finally to a scene from ""The Law""\]*  
**Donut Cop**: *\[Pushing Gumball into a police car with Darwin\]* Just get in!  
*\[The car drives off, passing by Felicity and Billy who look at each other with a horrified expression. The scene then flashes back to Felicity, still looking disgusted. Nicole drags in Felicity, whose feet loudly chisel off parts of the porch floor\]*  
**Considering how rarely the show does it, it's really cool to see past continuity being acknowledged like this +1**

**Billy**: Mother, these people scare me, so... pray tell, which is to be my play-date?  
**Nicole**: Billy, please meet my daughter Anais. *\[She points to Anais\]*  
**Anais**: *\[Surprised\]* Play-date?!  
**Nicole**: Yes, play-date!  
**Wait, Nicole didn't even** ***ask*** **Anais about this? If you're gonna invite someone's child over for a play date for your own, the least you should fucking do is ask them if they'd actually be okay with such a thing in case, y'know, the person is a bully or blackmailer or something worse. +20**

**Nicole**: *\[Placing coupons one by one on the counter\]* Half price, lower two points, buy one get one free, two for one, and double discount.  
**Larry**: That comes to the store *owing you* fifty cents.  
**Billy**: Mother, why is that woman trying to pay for her groceries with scraps of newspaper?  
**Felicity**: *\[Mockingly\]* She probably didn't study hard at school, dear.  
**She says, as Nicole just expertly worked out the right set of coupons to get her entire grocery shop for free,** ***and*** **get paid 50 cents for it. +5**

**Nicole**: Oh, what a charming little boy, he seems very clever for his age. I am- I have a very intelligent daughter, actually.  
**Felicity**: *\[Sarcastically\]* Oh yes, I'm sure she must be a little genius.  
**Nicole**: *\[Angrily\]* She's certified. I've got the papers to prove it.  
**Considering the government tried to take Darwin when they mistakenly thought he was this smart, how have they not come for Anais if she's a literal ceritified genius of this level? +1**

**Nicole**: Why don't you guys come over for lunch?  
**Felicity**: Oh, that's very kind of you, but first I have a few questions: what does your husband do?  
**People with this high of a standard are the worst. Like, you're never going to be able to realistically meet such high expectations,. You're just setting yourself up for disappointment, and placing unreasonably high amounts of pressure onto your child. I mean, not even** ***Nicole's p*****arents were this bad, and that's really saying something +5**

**Nicole**: *\[Forced, energetic\]* Ahahah, oh, you! *\[She punches Richard on the shoulder and he tumbles off the couch. Nicole moves over to Gumball and Darwin to embrace them\]* This is Gumball and Darwin. Darwin used to be a goldfish, but through love, care and of course, parenting skills, became... a goldfish with legs! Show 'em, sweety.  
*\[Darwin steps in front of Felicity and awkwardly puts a limp leg on her lap. She looks surprised\]*  
**Darwin**: Um, that's my leg, and uh... there's one more where that came from.  
*\[Felicity picks up the leg and leaves it for Darwin to stand on\]*  
**Felicity**: *\[Sarcastically\]* Huh. Very nice.  
**Nicole**: And this is Gumball, who can... *\[She stops for a moment and tries to think of something\]*  
**The fact Nicole couldn't think of a** ***single*** **thing that Gumball has accomplished or has done to be proud of is...really fucking sad honestly. She says he isn't a disappoimtment, but it's scenes like this that make that a little hard to believe sometimes +10**

*\[Anais and Billy are sitting at the coffee table with plates of food on it, in small chairs. In the background, everyone else is sitting awkwardly at the dinner table. The silence stretches, with no one eating but just glancing at each other and then away. Billy takes a long breath, nervously\]*  
**Billy**: I really would like to break the ice but I've no idea what to say.  
**Anais**: Ugh! Me too. I've been twiddling my thumbs under the table for ages trying to think of something.  
*\[Anais shows her knotted-up fingers and the two share a brief laugh\]*  
**Billy**: Allow me to introduce myself: I am William Jeffrey Fitzgerald Kitchener Parham III, although you can call me Billy.  
**Anais**: And I am Anais.  
**Billy**: *\[Chuckling\]* *Anais* to meet you.  
**Anais**: It's *Billy* nice to meet you, too.  
**Billy**: *\[Laughing\]* Not as quite good, but good effort.  
**Awww, it's really nice to Anais getting along well with someone her own age. -5**

**I'm sure the writers will take this perfect opportunity and use it to develop Anais and have her finally make friends and have adventures of her own, right?** 

**...right?**

*\[For a moment the scene shows the ""fancy cutlery"" next to Gumball's plate, including a gardening trough, a screwdriver and a small rake. Gumball proceeds to audibly scratch his butt with the backscratcher, then noticing Felicity and Nicole's apalled expressions, he uses it to take and slurp some more spaghetti\]*  
...  
**Ew. +1**

**Felicity**: *\[Mockingly\]* Well this is an... educational experience, but we should probably go before the car gets stolen. *\[She starts walking away\]*  
**Richard**: *\[Panicking\]* No, wait, you can't go yet! You'll miss the... uh, song, that Gumball and Darwin are gonna sing for you.  
**And this right here proves what a great father Richard is. At the start of the episode he didn't really give a fuck about this whole thing and was only going along with it so as to not anger Nicole. But now that he knows his daughter making a new friend is on the line, he's actually** ***genuinely*** **trying his best to keep Felicity around and to make sure things go well. And people say that he's a bad father? Yeah, right. -20**

**Anais**: I was gonna say ""the only one who's not"" *\[Puts on a dumb expression, smashes her head on the table repeatedly and covers her face in food, screaming\]* but yeah, you pretty much took out the words out of my mouth.  
*\[They share another laugh and Felicity notices it from across the room and glares at them\]*  
**Felicity sees her child getting on well and laughing with his new friend and is...mad? I get that she doesn't like Gumball, Darwin and Richard but what Anais hasn't done anything to warrant being looked down upon like the rest. At this point she's just being prejudiced +10**

**Felicity**: *\[Takes in a deep breath\]* Look, Nicole, I get it. You dropped out of college to marry your childhood sweetheart and life was fun until, whoops, your first disappointment.  
*\[She points at Gumball, who awkwardly raises his hand in acknowledgement\]*  
**Felicity**: So there you are working all hours to support your family while lover-boy over there is busy growing chins.  
*\[She points at Richard who nervously covers his chins\]*  
**Felicity**: Then, whoops, another disappointment.  
*\[She points at Darwin who waves both arms\]*  
**Felicity**: Followed by a third that you still dream is better than the others, I get it. You know you'll never succeed so you want your kids to succeed *for* you. You hope that being friends with someone like me will help you climb that ladder, but you're living a lie. You are not good enough, they are not good enough, you've either got it or you haven't, and you haven't. So just be happy with who you really are.  
**Fuck you. Genuinely, from the absolute bottom of my heart,** ***fuck you.*** **You do not get to come into someone's house and judge and insult every single thing about their entire lives. You have no** ***idea*** **what they've been through. You have no idea of the trials and struggles and dangers this family has gone through. Just because they don't meet your impossibly high standards of perfection that you ignorantly try to force upon everyone else.** 

**They may not be the most functional family, but who cares? As long as they're happy and as long as they're there to support each other, nothing else matters. And hey, at least they  aren't stubborn, aarogant, snooty, stuck up pieces of shit like you**  **+100**

**Nicole**: Fair enough, you wanna see who I really am?  
*\[Nicole suddenly turns into a hulking, roaring red demon with curling horns and glowing yellow eyes. The view returns to the conversation at the coffee table as in the background Richard is trying to hold back demon Nicole who is attacking Felicity, trying to defend herself with a dining chair\]*  
***Nonononono*****, Richard you let go of Nicole right now so she can give that piece of shit Felicty what she fucking deserves. +20**

**Anais**: This is probably the first time I've had a civilized conversation with anyone in this house.  
**Awwww,** ***c'mon*****, there's no way this is true. I'm sure you've had** ***plenty*** **of normal conversations with your siblings and parents before, even if they maybe get a little out of hand sometimes +5**

*\[Anais and Billy step outside and start singing ""Just You and Me""\]*  
**Anais** and **Billy**: *Just you and me*  
*Could live a life in perfect harmony*  
*That's satisfying intellectually*  
*And wave suburbia good-bye.*  
**Anais**: *Just you and me*  
**Billy**: *Just you and I*  
**Anais**: *Could visit East Berlin in Germany*  
**Billy**: *And then Versailles*  
**Anais**: *And ride a bicycle in New York City*  
**Billy**: *You can't deny that*  
**Anais** and **Billy**: *We'll have such a lovely time.*  
***Awwww,*** **this song is just too cute. Anais and Billy work realy well together, and I'm surprised is took this long for the writers to pair the two together -5**

*\[The view changes to show him pointing at the empty coffee table. Demon Nicole spits out Felicity and they rush over to the living room. They all look at the abandoned table (with Nicole returned to normal), then at the open front door. Nicole and Felicity groan at each other and burst into a cat fight\]*  
**Nicole**: This is your fault!  
**Felicity**: No, it's your fault!  
*\[Gumball shoves them apart\]*  
**Gumball**: This is both of your faults! They knew you'll never let them be together so they ran away! But if you wanna find them you're gonna have to work together.  
**Nonononononono,, it is absolutely 100000000000000% Felicity's fault. If she hadn't been such a aarogant jerk Nicole wouldn't have lost it, and everyone else would have been distracted trying to stop her +5**

**Felicity**: I'm sorry, you're not getting me in that car.  
**Nicole**: Challenge accepted.  
*\[Nicole picks up Felicity, who crosses her arms and stays stiff like a board. She repeatedly rams Felicity into the car door window, presumably to shove her inside\]*  
**Gumball**: *\[Concerned\]* Uh, do you want me to roll down the window?  
**Nicole**: Just a few more times.  
*\[She rams Felicity into the window again\]*  
**Ah, thank you Nicole. You have no idea how cathartic this is to see -10**

*\[Shot of inside the car as Nicole and Felicity are fighting over the wheel\]*  
**Nicole**: They would've gone to the museum.**F**  
**elicity**: No, they would've gone to the library.  
**Nicole**: The museum!  
**Felicity**: The library!  
**Nicole**: THE MUSEUM!  
**I mean...it could easily be both. Depends on which of the two are leading the way. And you know what the easiest solution for this is? Split up and check both locations. Boom, problem solved. It's that fucking easy +5**

*\[Gumball shoves them apart\]*  
**Gumball**: Alright, enough! Just in case you haven't noticed we haven't gone anywhere for fifteen minutes!  
*\[An exterior view of the car reveals that they have stopped in the middle of the road with horn-sounding cars whizzing by\]*  
**Gumball**: If you can't agree then I'll deal with it!  
**It's actually really satisfying to see Gumball taking charge for once and taking shit seriously for once. Wish we saw him do so more often -1**

**Gumball**: Hold on to your hats!  
*\[Just when it seems like the car will start moving, the windshield wipers turn on instead\]*  
**Gumball**: *\[Frustrated\]* Okay, I don't actually know how to make this thing move, so we're gonna run!  
**He says this, but we saw him drive a car in The Moustache way back in Season 1 +1**

*\[The third part of ""Just You and Me"" plays\]*  
**Billy**: *I'll grow a beard!*  
**Anais**: *And I'll wear specs.*  
**Billy**: *And hang out at Le Centre Pompidou*  
**Anais**: *We'll eat some crêpes*  
**Billy**: *I'll get a sailor tat and so will you*  
**Anais** and **Billy**: *I'll buy some decks*  
*And play our vinyl all day long.*  
***LMAO,*** **the cuts to Anais and Billy just fucking** ***vibing*** **and having the time of their lives whilst all of this is going on is fucking brilliant! -10**

**Darwin**: *\[Pointing off the screen in slow-motion\]* There they are!  
*\[They see Anais and Billy running happily into the museum at regular speed\]*  
**And, unsurprisingly, Nicole was right. If you needed anymore proof that Felicity is talking out of her ass, here you go. -5**

**Anais**: And Daisy the Donkey!  
**Billy**: *\[Snobbishly\]* Ahahahahahah! In a ironic way of course.  
**Anais**: *\[Offended\]* What? No, I love Daisy.  
**Billy**: *\[In a mocking, high-pitched voice\]* Oh, I am Daisy, the incarnation of the dumbing-down of a whole nation of children, while cashing in on merchandising!  
**Anais**: Well, what show do you watch?  
**Billy**: *Fireman Pete*, of course.  
**Anais**: Sorry Billy, but that's a deal-breaker.  
*\[Anais leaves the room with quiet disgust as everyone is left standing surprised at the shattering of the romantic atmosphere.\]*  
**Or...you could just...agree to disagree? +5**

**Also, c'mon writers! You had a chance for Anais to finally grow and develop as character, only to immediately throw it all away for no reason. Both in an out of universe. I mean, you seriously couldn't come up with a better reason for them to end the friendship other than not liking the same show? That literally the most petty reason to stop being friends with someone I've ever heard! +20**

**Felicity**: Oh, thank gosh I won't have to pretend to like you!  
*\[Nicole punches Felicity without even turning around. The episode ends abruptly as Felicity flies off and crashes into something off-screen\]*

1g5e8te,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1g5e8te/ive_been_openly_wearing_a_childless_cat_lady/,"I've been openly wearing a 'childless cat lady' t-shirt over the last few weeks, and the experience has been more interesting than anticipated","Foreword: I'm barely sure why I feel compelled to share all this, and it might just be completely ridiculous or unremarkable for all I know, but it feels like it might be valuable enough to bother to try. Plus, as it turns out... ""Extra strength"" coffee *is*; so let's do it. 

Introspection is often 'inadvertently extensive' and I have a lot of steam to let off here, so I'll try to start with the important part.

**TL;DR / Intro** - I, a notably masculine and/or physiologically imposing man, recently purchased a cute black t-shirt that says ""Childless Cat Lady"" in bold white text alongside a fashionably adorable graphic of a black cat decked out in stereotypically witchy adornments. It seemed like an awesome idea for many reasons, but the act of wearing it rapidly seemed to become far more impactful to strangers than I expected.

Real quick: If this is as far as the reader gets, I'd at least like to encourage Da Boyz to consider also looking online for a Childless Cat Lady shirt that suits your style/comfort. You may as well show your support on account of the fact that a childless man is going to have a hard time *remaining* childless if his formerly-childfree lady isn't allowed to be. 

More importantly... They're coming for us next, boys, I guarantee it. These kind of people do *not* stop pushing it until society is more ash than rubble.

__

Considering all the shit going on today, to say the least, I felt it was important to demonstrate openly that I, and theoretically other men too, are capable of acknowledging and understanding that women - more than half of our species - are actively under attack as of late. I hoped to do more than ""just"" cheer from the sidelines, I wanted to be an example. ...Or at least a walking billboard that advertises 'giving a fuck', if nothing else.

The kind of people that'd physically confront women over their personal agency often act bravely, confident in their own ""righteousness"" because women are viewed as unlikely to present a significant threat of physical/social retaliation. *My* initial idea, simply enough, was to go ahead and slap the 'childless cat lady' label on myself - an imposing and very obviously potentially dangerous man - as if to say: ""Hey, it's me, a childless cat lady, wink-wink, so if you've got something to say, I'm right here, bud...""

I figured it'd be quite unlikely for somebody to make any rude comments to a stranger when I'm standing behind them in line at the grocery store. They'd know I wouldn't stand for it and may even be seeking to ""actively dissuade"" such behaviors flat-out. I've always tried to live my life as a quiet beacon of safety for those in need when/if they need it, and in this case I wanted to be recognizable as such *before* they need it - or to insure they won't need it.

I started getting comments mere minutes after leaving the house to knock out some quick errands downtown, literally fifteen feet from my building's doorway. 

Women of all sorts, ranging from teenagers with glorious winged eyeliner to stereotypically grandmotherly ladies hobbling their way down the frozen food section, were taking the time to compliment the shirt here or there, or announcing that they're also 'cat ladies' while waiting for the crosswalk, or just smiling as they took the time to read it as I walked by.

Not a constant stream or anything, this isn't one of those ""then I found twenty dollars and everyone clapped"" kind of stories, but easily dozens of notable reactions of *some* sort in the span of two or three errands. I like to joke that I'm 'kind of autistic but not' and it still stood out to me.

This felt great, at first. It was 'working'. It was making an impact. It was making a point. At very worst, some merely enjoyed the irony of the message. But as time went on, I rapidly started to get the feeling that many of these women may have genuinely never seen a 'manly man' (or otherwise) openly stating whose side he's *really* on. Honestly, I almost felt like some sort of exotic animal or some shit.

Shortly after, every once in a while I'd notice a subtle change in a stranger's posture, just a quiet sense of relief or safety glimpsed shortly after I turned the aisle of a hardware store or whatever. 

I realized that they might've been just... Subconsciously recognizing that I probably wasn't going to be ""a problem""? I wasn't going to try to hit on them, or ask for their number, or brush uncomfortably close as I passed by, or any number of other tragically ""unremarkable"" things. Perhaps they felt like nobody else was going to get away with such acts while I was nearby either. For all I know, that kind of store might've been viewed as a ""man's place"", and who could blame her? I, myself, noticed plenty of MAGAfied-looking fellows waddling around in search of caulk guns and PVC glue or whatever.

It's hard to describe what I'm talking about here, I fear. It's an extremely minor thing, a miniscule alteration of demeanor or even just ""vibe"", but it stood out to me. I think it'd stand out to anyone. It's the kind of interaction that rises to the forefront of your mind hours later, fifteen minutes into a long shower - and it was happening multiple times a week.

Where I was first excited or even proud to show my support in such an openly passive way, the whole thing started to feel heart-wrenching. It's just a shirt, I thought to myself. It shouldn't be making a noticeable impact on strangers. A piece of cheaply-printed text on a piece of equally cheap cloth shouldn't make me feel like I'm improving someone's day - let alone ensuring their safety or comfort - just by the act of wearing it *at all*.

It's just a shirt. It shouldn't be capable of sending a message like that. It shouldn't *have* to be. And while I'm more than happy, even ecstatic to show my support in such an unexpectedly vivid way, I do *not* want to live in a world where that's even an important thing to do. There shouldn't be anything special about that, nor about the fact that a person like me choose to wear it. 

But there is something remarkable about that. *Very* apparently, there is.

I've been well-aware of this kind of garbage for years, everything from casual workplace misogyny to problematic gender role nonsense, but it's the act of simply wearing this cute little shirt while walking around downtown in (a notably progressive city, no less) that really showed me how dire things are. A couple of weeks ago I even found myself unexpectedly tearing up about it. *None* of this is news to me by any means - I spend considerable (shockingly considerable) time online writing deeply about these problems all the time, and yet this collection of tiny little ""insignificant"" seconds-long interactions sit heavily in my mind.

It seems silly. All of this sounds absurd, I'm sure. I'm barely even sure why I'm writing all this out, but it feels important to share even if nobody wants to read through this needlessly introspective essay-rant. I'll mention it again, no doubt.

I'll keep wearing it here or there - for only another few months, ideally. I'd like for it to become an unremarkable thing, just a reminder of a weird shared sociopolitical nightmare. It's just a shirt, and what it says shouldn't be seen as a remarkable symbol. Not like that, anyway.

Hopefully it'll be ""just a shirt"" early next year.

It's been very hard, as I've essentially been abandoned emotionally for years but now it's really becoming concrete. Makes it hurt worse since my 1 year old daughter has been discarded too. 

I live about a half hour from my parents, and unfortunately still work close to their neighborhood. On my drive home today, I passed my father on the road. We saw each other, and the look of anger on his face...it's clear nothing has changed.

A few months ago, when NC was a little more fresh, this would have sent me into a spiral towards eating a lot of junk food or compulsively shop...something material to make me feel better. This has been the pattern for YEARS, when I've had to deal with my family's toxicity. But today, I got home, only grabbed an apple with peanut butter and two small pieces of chocolate, made myself a hot cup of coffee, put on some funny tv, and played & danced with my daughter. 

I AM SO PROUD OF THIS PROGRESS!!!! 

The changes that are starting to emerge are so encouraging, it just sucks that it's taking the loss of most of my family to achieve them.

*BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!*

Jordan groaned as he slapped the top of the alarm clock with a limp arm. The time - 9:30am - blinked expectantly at him in neon green on the small LED screen, and as he rubbed his eye, he searched the room for his clothes.

It wasn’t as if Jordan had much to get up for, really - the odd errand, mostly consisting of just buying food - but if he wasn’t careful he could very easily waste a day just sleeping. His clothes slipped on like a glove, and he shuffled a pair of worn-out sneakers onto his feet as he manoeuvred himself towards the door.

The air was crisp and cool as it blew past his face; he hurried to pull his hood up over his head to shield himself from it. Chicago was unlike anywhere he’d ever known, and since coming here, Jordan found he had to quickly grow accustomed to the local idiosyncrasies - for example, the L train was easily the quickest way to move around the city, even despite a sudden alteration of the tracks in recent times. He fumbled in his pockets for his loose change, eager to make his way to the centre of town. Overheard, a flock of geese squawked, flying in their familiar V-shaped arrow towards Lake Michigan.

He could get used to it, all things considered. There was a part of him that missed home and as he felt the biting wind on his face, he thought of his mother. It would be a joy to go back, he thought to himself. But as the incoming train screeched across rusted tracks, announcing its imminent arrival, he shook his head. No, he should focus on the now. He should focus on Chicago, and the errands that were waiting for him.

“Oh! You’re that guy from the [support group](https://reddit.com/r/DCNext/comments/1awrqkn/the_new_titans_6_tipping_the_scales/), right?”

Tim had been spaced out staring at the clock hanging over the barista’s counter for so long, he barely realised that the short-haired young man in front of him was talking to him. Yes, he did know him - he had met him briefly at a support group for the attacks on Chicago a few months prior.

“Sebastian?” Tim asked, knowing the answer.

“You remembered,” the guy nodded, impressed. He placed a hand on Tim’s shoulder. “Hey, good to see you again. Did you ever read the stuff I emailed to you?”

Tim recalled what he was referring to - most of the links had been hateful, sourceless drivel made to instil fear and hatred in its readers, with some consisting of social media posts, but there had been one or two scholarly studies mixed in which, while inconclusive, suggested that there was money and time going into the study of the Reawakened.

“I did,” Tim said. “I appreciate you sending it over.”

“Of course, dude. A lot of the people at those support groups don’t wanna hear about it, y’know? So it’s nice to know someone actually took a look.” Sebastian glanced up at the time before placing his cup down on a nearby table and reaching for his pocket. “Listen, I’ve gotta dash, but…” Sebastian fumbled for something in his wallet. He dug through the card slot and retrieved a single dark brown card with a small white typeface emblazoned upon it. There was a small number 6 embossed into the corner, which Sebastian ran his thumb over as he handed it to Tim. “Here.”

Tim analysed it carefully. The card was vague, but contained an address in the centre of Chicago, as well as a date and time. As he rotated it slightly, the harsh white light overhead glinted against a symbol laminated into the centre - an isoceles triangle. Tim blinked.

“I’ll see you around, yeah?” Sebastian said, raising a hand to wave goodbye. And as he scooped up his cup of coffee, he strode towards the door, swinging it open and departing. Tim couldn’t seem to tear his eyes away from the card. He, of course, recognised the symbol - how could he not? He chewed on the inside of his cheeks as he thought about how best to approach this information, this lead that had seemingly fallen into his lap.

“Green tea for Tim?”

He hardly looked up from the small rectangle in his hands as he reached for the cup. No, he had to tell the others, he thought. This wasn’t his fight alone.

&nbsp;

○○ Ⓣ ○○

&nbsp;

Tim placed the card on the table in front of his fellow Titans. Each of them leaned forwards to look at it before Conner swiped it up into his hands to take a closer look.

“Sebastian?” Conner said incredulously. “I mean, I know why you asked that guy for his sources, but I never thought…” He trailed off.

“There was always a risk,” Tim said, pacing. “Always a chance. And now, here it is.”

Bart tilted his head. “So, what do you think it is? Some kind of conference?”

“Doesn’t say,” Tim said. “And Sebastian was in such a hurry, he didn’t stop to tell me. Either way, though, this could be our ticket. What do we think?”

Raven nodded, as did Conner. “I say, don’t look a gift horse in the mouth,” Raven said. “We already knew this Sebastian guy could be up to something, and now he’s literally handed you the opportunity of a lifetime.”

“I mean, you’ve gotta, right?” Bart agreed, looking between the other Titans members.

There was a lull in the conversation, and as silence fell for a moment, all eyes fell on Mar’i, who was silent apart from the slight tapping of her heel against the floor as she nervously bounced her leg.

Conner opened his mouth to ask for her thoughts, but she spoke first. “You shouldn’t go.”

Tim frowned. “Why’s that?”

“This is the Delta Society we’re talking about, Tim,” Mar’i explained. There was something in her voice - annoyance? Panic? Desperation? “This isn’t something we can take lightly. We don’t know what they’re capable of. Especially considering recent events.”

“Which is precisely why I need to go there and figure that out.”

“As Tim Drake?”

Tim blinked. “Yes, of course. I was invited, he’ll be expecting me.”

Mar’i huffed, standing up. “You - we - don’t have any idea what you’re getting yourself into. You said yourself - you don’t know whether it’s a dinner, a meeting, or a full-on initiation. You could be walking your way into a death trap.” Mar’i folded her arms and looked at Tim. “You need to go in as Rook, not as Tim.”

Tim pondered her words for a moment. There was something in them that resonated with him, a wake-up call to him regarding his work-life balance. It was an issue that Tim had difficulty with in the past, and one that continued to rear its head every once in a while. And yet, as he looked down at the card in Conner’s hand, he shook his head.

“I understand, Mar’i,” he started. “Really, I do. But I think this could be our chance.”

Mar’i said nothing, instead electing to sit down again. Raven stirred, made uncomfortable by the tension in the room.

“I’ll think it through,” Tim concluded. “I’ll take what you’ve all said into account.”

“*The next stop—bzzzzzzzzt—... Thank you.*”

*Helpful*, Jordan thought to himself. He clutched his bags of groceries hard in one hand, a coffee cup clutched in the other, and he attempted to steady himself by leaning his weight against the side of the train as it buffeted back and forth along the track. It was less so the weight of the bags that was the issue, and more the way they slid across each other, jostling the contents and threatening to snap at any moment.

Jordan peered out of the window and up at the cloudy mid-afternoon sky. A single plane streaked through the air, leaving a long white trail against the grey backdrop as it sailed towards its destination. He felt himself leaning forwards, unbalanced with the extra weight of his shopping bags, and as he lurched to catch himself, his coffee cup tipped. Warm brown liquid splashed against his leg and down the bright blue bags in his hands, and as he looked down at his newly-stained trousers, he sighed.

Giving up on the coffee in his hand, he placed the mostly empty cup on a nearby unoccupied seat and huffed. Jordan was glad, despite what he would consider a wildly unproductive and uneventful day, that he was on his way home. And as he watched the plane above him become a dot in the distance, he felt the train slowing to a halt at his stop.

Tim tapped the small card against the back of his hand as he approached the building. All things considered, it blended into the backdrop of the city; the address was just another room in just another skyscraper in the middle of town, a dot on the map. They had truly made themselves a needle in a haystack, Tim thought to himself. He checked his watch as he crossed the threshold into the lobby of the building - 4:58pm. Two minutes until the meeting. The AC whipped through his hair as he moved through the automatic doors, his eyes fixed on the elevator doors on the other side of the room. Soft jazz music played softly, bouncing off of marble walls and polished floors as a receptionist mumbled to someone in her headset. It was all very… normal.

Tim pressed the button labelled with an ‘up’ arrow and waited.

After a moment, a light chime rang out, and the doors opened. The elevator was immaculately clean, and Tim was met with a reflection of himself. He stepped inside. Checking his card, he made note of the number embossed into the corner - six. Then, looking up at the numbers on the elevator, stretching all the way up to 25, he pressed his thumb firmly against the button labelled “6” and waited.

The young Titan looked up at his reflection in the mirror. He ran a hand through his hair, attempting to smoothen the slight frizz. He had taken care in choosing his outfit, opting for a shirt and jacket with chequered slacks and a smart pair of sneakers. He couldn’t be sure how formal this event was going to be, and as such had chosen an outfit which made himself appear refined yet relaxed - towing the line between casual and formal.

As he looked at himself and straightened his jacket, however, he thought back to what Mar’i had said. He furrowed his brow; had he gotten it wrong? Was he walking into a situation that Rook may be better equipped for?

But as the elevator dinged, announcing his arrival on the sixth floor, it was too late to doubt himself. He was going in as Tim.

The doors opened out onto a large open plan floor, decorated with various dark brown tables scattered around the room. A large red tablecloth was strewn across the centremost one, displaying various meats and cheeses with noticeable gaps made by hungry patrons. There were no more than two dozen people dotted around the room; some stood huddled in the corner and mumbled to each other through bites of charcuterie, others sat checking their watches and phones, and others stood nervously with their arms folded, attempting to blend in with the furniture. A younger man fiddled with a microphone near the far wall, tapping his finger against it and receiving a dull thud through the speakers in response.

Tim took a deep breath and strode confidently into the room. A tall, thin man in a navy jacket approached him with a smile, his hand outstretched. “Nice of you to come along.”

Tim nodded politely. “Thank you for the invitation.” He reached out to shake the man’s hand, who gladly took it with a firm shake.

“Come in, enjoy the food. We have a speech in about—” He checked his watch. “Oh, any minute now in fact. But otherwise, explore, socialise - whatever you please.”

Tim smiled slightly. “Sounds great. Thanks again.”

And with a polite nod, the taller man departed.

As he took in the scene, Tim’s eyes lingered on a group of younger men having a slowly amplifying conversation just a few feet away from him. The tallest of the men - who appeared to be leading the charge - was gesticulating broadly with his arms, and with a frustrated sigh, he commented, “I mean, they can’t hide that thing forever.”

Tim perked up. He walked calmly towards the group with a slight smile on his face. “Hi. Pardon me, I’m Tim. Nice to meet you all.”

The trio each nodded politely, the tallest man clearing his throat. “Derek. Nice to meet you too.”

Somewhat worried he had prevented them from continuing, Tim chirped, “What were we talking about?”

A man with a long dark ponytail raised a pointed finger, swallowing a large mouthful of buffet food. “Cadmus.” He spat the word like ichor, a sneer on his face.

“Yeah,” the third man added, folding his tattooed arms. “God, they really think they can pull one over on us, huh? They think they can just hide that thing forever like we’re not gonna notice?”

The first man - Derek - scoffed. “Exactly, man.”

“Yeah, exactly,” Tim added, his words quiet. He nodded slowly. “They might be smart, but we’re smarter.”

The three men all gave affirmative nods, each with differing levels of enthusiasm. Then, as a silence hung over the quartet, Tim gave the group a polite smile. “Have a good night, guys. I’m sure I’ll catch you later.”

Tim continued on. Despite a distinct lack of appetite, Tim reached for a dark red paper plate stacked next to the trays of food and pondered his choices. His eyes darted upwards for a moment as he surveyed his surroundings once more. Many of the patrons had taken to moving towards the stage, most of them male, with a few exceptions, notably—

Tim froze. Mar’i had locked eyes with him from across the room. She clutched her paper plate tightly between her thumb and forefinger so tightly that the plate had begun to bend and form a valley. *What was she doing here?*

“Thank you for coming, everyone,” a man spoke into a microphone. “Let’s get the evening started properly.”

We went into Panera to buy a cup of coffee, he sat by my side, perfect heel position. He waited patiently. We had that coffee outside. He saw another dog, who he ignored. We went for a mall walk, close heel work. Went into a store, he was glued to me. 

And this trainer bought a hands free leather lead. Because that’s what I want him to use at the supermarket. That’s our reward. He will go with me once we both decide he is ready to detect gluten. Not quite celiacs, just very allergic to it. 

Yet, this morning he was being a little on the not gonna listen to you side…teenagers!

I spoke with every other baker if they can cover for me tomorrow as i was unwell, they all said no. My store manager informed earlier that we have to call the store if we can't come for our shift. 

But on 15th October evening around 10pm i messaged my store manager that i can't work because i am having stomach pain, my stomach got upset. I messaged her because it was already late and my store would close at 11:30 pm. 

She didn't see my message because she was sleeping so around 11:30 pm i messaged the assistant manager who was in the store that i can't come as i am not well, she told me that she spoke with the store manager so i can call and tell her. I call her at 11:30 pm that i am not well, my stomach is painful. I even ordered a medicine from Walmart because there was no clinic open at that time. 

She said only a few hours are left for my job to start, how could i say no now and yelled at me to call her at night because i awake everyone at her home. She cut my call in between, i called twice but it was going on voicemail, then she called back and yelled again and asked me to think what i did was right or wrong by calling her at night.

How come is that my fault? Whom should i contact in case of emergency if i can't come? I wasn't feeling well around 7:00 pm but that time the pain wasn't too much but around 9:00 pm i can't bear the pain and i asked other bakers if they could cover for me but they had their school.

So, i went to the store at 3:30 am in pain, trust me it was painful, not like i will die of pain but still it was painful, the same moment i reached there, another staff came who works at the front counter and told me that i can go home if i am in pain as store manager asked her at midnight to do my job for today. So i went home, then she messaged me at 2:00 pm today, 16th October, to call the store and know when my next shift is. I called them and they told me that my next 2 days shift for 17th and 18th October is cancelled. Now i have to go on Saturday. Was that fair to cancel my shift? She didn't even ask me about that. I can't complain to anyone there because my colleague told me that even if i call my General manager he won't be able to do anything as store manager is very clever. *If i am wrong please tell me that too*

so after she leaves, I follow up and ask her to dinner, which I normally don’t do. 
She said “that depends on if you’re going to waste my time and what we’re going to do” which is fair.
I responded “normal date? Discussion etc”

After a couple days, she says she got out of a relationship last year and not really looking for anything, but would still like to go out. I agreed. 

Mind you I’m older than her, so it’s not a big deal if I get rejected. So I kind of left it at that, we have coinciding days off with our jobs. Weekend rolls around, I don’t hear anything from her. So she follows up and says next Monday we can grab coffee. Cool. Gets quiet that weekend too. 

Question is, is she interested in me? During the week, she texts me all the time, sometimes she initiates texts in the morning. And will text me throughout the day. And has for weeks, but when it comes to hanging out. It doesn’t happen. She sends pics of her dog, and of her day. What’s going on, etc. I’m just confused because she led off with me wasting her time, and now it’s like. We’re building a rapport through text….but hanging out doesn’t happen. Thoughts?

1g5dqgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1g5dqgn/word_vomit/,Word Vomit,"~~It was a day today. Sitting here reflecting on all that transpired. Day yet?~~

I woke up this morning, 330 as always I look at the time its 3:33, I shouldn't be awake, but my these damn dreams keep doing something to me. They make no sense, I don't walk around and think about you. Believe it or not, Ive been on dates, been out with friends, I've got a few people just waiting for me to give them the time of day. I make time, and then I just lose the nerve, because I know I can't give them what they are looking for, one would love just to fuck. The whole thing makes me, sick because I don't want to fuck, I mean I do, the thought of someone touching me right now, makes me feel like vomitting, even though I know its what I probably need.  I want a friend. Like a real actually friend that I can trust. At this point, because of all the shit, I just don't talk to anyone.  I mean I do, made some awesome acquaintances this weekend.  Still somehow, I found you at the back of my head, longing, wishing maybe to share the experience with you. You would of loved it.  I mean maybe. Stupid memories of you and him both bunny hopping, you trying filled my head. You were so fucking idk, adorable I guess. You were so happy, free. sigh.

I get these moments where, it feels like glass in my chest, as I feel the emotion move up my throat, and then it feels like I choking on glass, trying to repress it, so I don't, and tears just silently trickle down my cheeks.  I have my myself convinced that some of these times, the emotion isn't mine. I know you well enough and we've talked of these things once or more, like watching Pinocchio, when of course, you weren't crying, but my eyes just silently seeped out my right eye, because I was curled up on my left. I won't dare assume, but so far, my intuition hasn't been wrong about anything.

I did a thing today, I had it planned, because well I know and am very aware whatever I am experiencing and going through is not so healthy in so many ways.  Thank you for making me a better person. No vices have I picked up during these last 4 months, and I say 4, because I picked squares, for the time you were still here, but I haven't picked them up since.  Whatever is taking place, Ive somehow known I need to have a clear and level head. Ive spent a lot time in the dark, and under the sky.  The night sky has felt like a blanket until the recent days, its kinda cold. 

Anyway, I went to counseling today.  I actually like going. I enjoy the feedback and the honest outside opinion. We all need that sometimes. To be able to talk to someone that is not apart of our daily life, and is not in the exact same situation.  To help us gain clarity. I am aware you have to be careful where you get your advice from. Sometimes empathy can come from a snake, and you'll fall into a hole and buried before you realize the snake bit you.  I was honest about everything. I didn't go so deep in the spiritual shit, but I didn't have to.  This fucking guy man, he told me, he was impressed with how I was able to process all of it but that, I was far from insane. lol. Told me I was handling some heavy shit, divorce isn't easy, and its obviously, harder when you genuinely love someone. I sorta felt like I wasted 3 hours of my time, but I guess maybe I needed to. I felt better slightly, until the lawn mower didn't start, but that's ok, I also put in my 30 days today,  time to do what I do best, sell everything and roll. sigh.

The one thing that keeps coming up in my mind, and the therapist and I talked about, ya know he said "" just wait, when your not looking, the love of your life will just be there."" HAHAHAHAHHA.  what the fuck man, seriously.  What the actually fuck, I had that, that was us. I sure af was not looking for you. There you were, doing dumb AF shit, and I haven't looked back since.  The beginning keeps coming up a lot for me. I wasn't perfect, I did make mistakes, I have had to apologize admit my shame, eat my words, but I never stopped. I saw you.  I saw through you, I knew you. Ive always known you, and I don't know what to do with it. You were such a big part of me. You balanced me.  I am not saying you didn't frustrate the fuck outta me, but I mean, my kids are assholes too, I down throw them on chopping block. The dog eats all of our panties off the bathroom floor, and we don't hex her.  ( tmi I know).

I just don't understand, I feel lost someday, like I know the sun is shining, but I can't feel it. I know where I'm going, but it feels like the wrong way. I know its just me drinking coffee, but it just doesn't taste the same. I keep looking for the way forward, but its like I'm just supposed to stay, which is insane to try explain so I won't. 

I know this month may be tough for your family, I know you've been through some shit over the last few months, its not my business, and I just take all these feelings and send love on prayers for reprieve. I should stop writing, however it is the only way for me to bleed it out.  I did say I love you at 11:11, I couldn't answer, I was siting in Therapy then class, I know what you wanted, I am going to do it. I wish it wasn't the answer, but if it makes you happy, and that's what you need, to a be a better version of you for you, yea, I got it.

I try not get upset at all the other BS that surrounds this, because it really doesn't fucking matter. I just hope that she takes care of you, and gives you everything that I couldn't. Really, you deserve it. At the end of the day, it is all that matters, you deserve a life, you don't have to run from, and a life where you can safe and know you don't ever have to put those walls up again.  Because your such a beautiful person, I know, I've seen it. I loved that person, even if I do it from afar, you'll always be my favorite adult human.

These are just my random thoughts, I was advised to type them out, instead of telling the moon, LOLOLOL. That happened too.  I think the therapist was wrong on that, but I smiled typing it out so maybe. 

Even a helper needs help, just like a healer needs healing sometimes.  Dogs are way cheaper though and they don't talk back. 

I hope the moon shines you tonight. Good Night.

I hope some of you can relate to and appreciate the piece.

Ralph had just wrapped up another long day on the road, traveling from dealership to dealership to inspect vehicles. His job was straightforward—take detailed photos of each car, conduct a basic visual inspection, and file his reports. It wasn't glamorous, but it paid the bills and gave him plenty of time to think during the long drives. Usually, he headed straight home after his last appointment, eager to relax and maybe work on his latest sci-fi story on his PC.

Today, however, as he navigated through the light drizzle that had started, he felt an inexplicable urge to take a different route. Passing through a part of town he didn't usually visit, he noticed a cozy-looking café nestled between a bookstore and a flower shop. The warm glow from its windows contrasted sharply with the gray evening. On a whim, he decided to stop—a rare detour from his routine.

Stepping inside, Ralph was greeted by the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of quiet conversations. He usually doesn't go to these kinds of places, but something about the atmosphere drew him in. Feeling slightly out of place, he ordered a mocha and looked for a seat. The café was busier than he'd expected, and the only available spot was a small table near the window.

He sat down and pulled out his cellphone, deciding to jot down some notes for his story. He preferred working on his PC at home, but ideas didn't always wait for convenience. His phone served as a makeshift notebook, capturing snippets of dialogue or plot points that came to him unexpectedly.

As he began typing, the door opened with a tinkling of bells, letting in a cool breeze. He glanced up briefly to see a woman entering, her long brown hair flowing in the draft, shaking the raindrops from her umbrella. She scanned the room,  searching for an empty seat, but every table was occupied except for the one with Ralph.

She approached hesitantly. ""Excuse me,"" she said with a friendly smile. ""Do you mind if I share your table? It's a bit crowded tonight.""

Ralph looked up, momentarily caught off guard by her presence. She had beautiful hazel eyes and a warm demeanor that put him at ease. ""Oh, not at all,"" he replied, gesturing to the empty chair across from him. ""Please, go ahead.""

""Thank you,"" she said, settling into the seat. She placed her cup on the table and pulled out a book from her bag. Ralph noticed she wasn't absorbed in her phone like most people; instead, she began reading quietly, occasionally sipping her drink.

They sat in comfortable silence for a few minutes. Ralph tried to focus on his notes, but his curiosity got the better of him. He glanced up and noticed the cover of her book—a classic novel he had read and loved Cannery Row.

""That's a great book,"" he said, nodding toward her.

She looked up, pleasantly surprised. ""Oh, you've read it?""

""Several times, actually,"" he admitted. ""It's one of my favorites.""

She smiled. ""Mine too. There's something timeless about it.""

""Agreed,"" Ralph said. ""The characters are so well-developed, and the story just pulls you in.""

She closed the book gently, marking her place with a small ribbon. ""I'm Riley, by the way.""

""Ralph,"" he replied, extending his hand. They shook hands, and he felt a slight spark, as if this simple gesture carried more weight than usual.

They began to talk more freely after that. Riley told him about her job as an HRIS analyst, working with employee data systems and how it could be both challenging and tedious. ""Sometimes I just need to get away from all the numbers,"" she admitted.

""I know the feeling,"" Ralph said. ""I spend my days inspecting cars, which isn't exactly thrilling. Writing helps me escape.""

""Writing?"" she asked with interest. ""What do you write?""

""Just some science fiction stories,"" he replied, suddenly feeling a bit self-conscious. ""It's a hobby, really. I usually work on them at home.""

Her eyes lit up. ""That's fascinating! I've always admired people who can create entire worlds with words.""

He shrugged modestly. ""It's nothing serious, but it keeps me entertained.""

""Maybe someday I'll get to read one of your stories,"" she said with a smile.

""Maybe,"" he echoed, feeling a pleasant warmth at the thought.

They continued chatting, the conversation flowing effortlessly from one topic to another. They discovered shared interests in books, a mutual appreciation for classic literature, and a love for exploring new places in the city.

Time seemed to slip away as the café around them gradually emptied. The barista began wiping down tables and flipping chairs, signaling that closing time was approaching.

Riley glanced at her watch, her eyes widening slightly. ""Wow, I didn't realize how late it was.""

Ralph looked around, surprised to find the café nearly deserted. ""I guess time flies when you're having fun.""

She smiled softly. ""It does.""

They both stood up and gathered their things. Stepping outside, they found that the rain had stopped, leaving the pavement glistening under the streetlights.

""Would you like to maybe grab coffee again sometime?"" Ralph asked, trying to sound casual but unable to hide the hopefulness in his voice.

Riley looked at him, her eyes reflecting the soft glow of the lights. ""Sure, I'd like that,"" she replied. ""Here, let me give you my number.""

They exchanged contact information, and she tucked her phone back into her bag. ""I'm glad I decided to stop in tonight,"" she said.

""Me too,"" Ralph agreed.

They said their goodbyes, and as Riley walked away, Ralph felt a sense of anticipation he hadn't experienced in a long time. He headed to his car, his thoughts no longer on work or even his stories, but on the unexpected connection he'd just made.

Sitting behind the wheel, he took a moment to reflect. It was strange how a simple change in routine—a spontaneous decision to stop at a café—had led to meeting someone who felt so instantly familiar. He started the engine with a smile, looking forward to what might come next.",2,1729122770.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Never smoked/drink

Bloating after eating, constipation that switches to normal stools, mucus, belching, acid reflux, no diarrhea or pain, bile

1.5 weeks ago I started having constipation  that I could only pass pebble stools after a lot of water, it would usually come out with mucus.
I then started having bloating after eating, a lot of trapped gas, and constipation, the stools that came out were always normal looking but sometimes they looked light brown but always formed and never had diarrhea.

The bloating got a bit better and so did the constipation but now i'm having bowel movements 2x a day, I also drink a lot of coffee.

A couple hours ago I had a normal looking brown stool that had a yellowish/brown in the middle liquid like. I'm really scared this might be pancreatic cancer.
I have no jaundice but I feel fatigued.

I had blood work done 3 weeks apart from different doctors and while pretty much everything else is within desirable range, my cholesterol appears to be really high for some reason. 

My first test (panel taken from a blood draw) through my regular doctor and the result were:

Total: 212
HDL: 49
LDL: 125
Triglycerides: 188

3 weeks later I took a second test. My work was providing free screening (pricked finger) so I thought why not. The results today are:

Total: 237
HDL: 45
LDL: 174
Triglycerides: 90

That’s a nearly 50 point increase on my LDL in 3 weeks! 

For context, I have a desk job but I walk a ton and try to hike as much as possible. My diet is black coffee for breakfast, lunch is usually something small from the deli (most of the time I skip lunch and only eat dinner though), then for dinner I’ll usually make like chicken and potatoes or something- although yesterday I did eat a grilled cheese for dinner. I do typically smoke weed before bed tho.


Could this have been a false positive or something?? Do I *really* need to start watching what I eat and exercising more?? I don’t think I’m peak physical form or anything but last summer I completed a 28mile hike in one day, so I thought my results would be a bit better at least!

Given everything I've seen on reddit, I don't believe I've had an overly tough life. But boy does it feel like it sometimes. 

**My Family Picture:** I'm a 25M with three younger brothers, Dad 45M, Mum 45F, Step-Dad 44M. The youngest two brothers are from my Mum's current marriage. 

I’m not sure whether it's trauma or my lack of brain capacity, but I don't have many memories of my childhood... I’m not sure whether I blocked them out or I can't remember - can a therapist can explain this?

From the age of 5 my parents have been divorced. My mum has since re-married to my step-dad or as I call him the **Devil Incarnate**. This man has been in my life for longer than I can remember and I can honestly say I hate him, pure **visceral hate.**

He is a literal man child. My first memory of him was being sat in his gaming room, just watching as a kid and trying to give my opinion or helping him win. Next thing you know he's swearing and shouting at me, telling me to get out of the room. 

The memories of him progress from there. I remember we moved to his city and his house. Which means he had his friends there, this would result in drunken nights where he would cause arguments with my mum. To the point where he was kicking doors down, making the whole house shake and screaming the place down for no reason at all, other than he was drunk. Again this progressed to the point where he would physically hit my mum, but nothing changes after this. 

At some point my dad caught wind of what was happening in that house and as you can imagine he was not very happy. We came back to my dad's house one day during the summer holidays, to which him and my mum started arguing and it got heated to the point where my dad ended up with a coffee table over his head and throwing it across the room. This is anger, I have never seen from him before or since.

Things did get better for a little bit, when my mum moved back to our home city where she had her own house and the step-dad only came to visit to see his son. However this was shorted lived, as he soon wormed his way back into our lives. Eventually living with us again, and as you can imagine some people never change. More of the same drinking and arguing ensued for years and years.

Oddly enough I distinctly remember a lot of arguing happening on a Thursday evening. My younger brother had already had enough and left our house to live with our dad, as he hated my step-dad and resented my mum for staying with him. 

To this day I am used a communication tool between that brother and my mum, as they rarely speak so I have to try bring them together or even get them to talk. Often times I would have to comfort my youngest brothers who would be balling their eyes out in their room. 

Again arguments became physical, loud and aggressive. A lot of the times things in the house were broken from the arguments and at times my mum would have black eyes. To the point where sometimes, I would message the neighbour to call the police (not that they did). This is where I realised, there are not many people out there that will help you.

Besides, countless other things he's done when drunk, one including walking into the hall where are shoes are kept thinking it's the bathroom and pissing over all our school shoes... The day before school, with my mum having to clean up his mess.

When I was around 10 it was just me and my mum in the house. My dad and brother were at their house, which was a 5 mins walk away. I heard a glass smash downstairs and I come down to see that my mum is cutting her arm with a broken glass. I couldn't get her to stop. 

So, I had to phone my dad to help but maybe I didn't explain the urgency as my dad seemed to be taking a while to get there. So, I had to get on my bike and pedal as fast as I could to get to my dad, I met him half way and told him she was bleeding, to which he started running. He couldn't get her to stop cutting, in the end he had to threaten to calling the police before she would stop. 

Fast forward a few years, the normal cycle of arguing and drinking has continued. When I was 14 we had a street party. This included all 4 younger brothers, my mum, step-dad & his sister with her two kids. As you can imagine there was plenty of drinking going on. Again my step-dad went too far, to the point at which he was outside the house trying to dance with other women. 

My mum managed to get him in the house and us kids were now in our rooms. He was arguing and wanting to continue the party and to keep drinking, he came upstairs and threw up in the hallway, went to their bedroom and came back out the room accusing other people for throwing up, blaming everyone else in the house. Again screaming, shouting & kicking doors around the house, at this point his sister was so scared she took her kids and left. 

After which he proceeded to punch holes in the walls and TV. He then went downstairs continuing to argue, then falling into self pity ending up picking up a knife in the kitchen threatening to cut him himself (police now phoned) he continued to bellow and cry saying his kids don't love him. He did end up cutting into himself, making his arm bleed deep enough that both the police and ambulance were needed at the house to take him away. Still, my mum let him back in the house the next day, as she took care of his arm.

The cycle continues.

I think this is it for now, my younger years were the peak of the mountain for me, but that doesn’t mean this has stopped. He is still here, he may be older but his narcissitic behaviour is still plaguing our lives, as for my mum she doesn’t get any better. 

Typing has been a form of therapy for me, maybe I’ll share more in the future.

So far, I have felt a slight increase in engery and motivation for a few hours similar to how I would feel if I had a strong coffee but I don't really feel like this dosage is helping with my, frankly, horrendous ADHD symptons. I am still struggling to initiate and complete tasks, tired, endlessly scrolling through reddit and such on my phone. After the effort, time and money it's taken to reach this point I am feeling somewhat dissapointed.

My doctor made my follow up appointment for 3 months time. What I wanted to ask the community is it normal for your psychiatrist to ask you to take 3 months to try the starting 30mg daily dose?

We've been on a couple of dates and, while nothing in terms of a spark of passion has materialised, we're getting on well and have agreed to see each other again next week (our work schedules clash a bit and next week is our only mutual day off). 

I've also gotten back in contact with a woman (34f) I very briefly had a romantic interest in when we were in our teens (I was 19 and she was 18). Anyway, we've sort of agreed to go for a coffee at the weekend after not speaking for over 15 years. She's also divorced, and I'm not certain but may have children. 

My question is: would you pursue the woman I've been out with a couple of times already, in the hope that it does develop into a romantic relationship, or would you move on and try and rekindle something from the past? I'm genuinely torn.

You might ask why don’t you just stay at the highest paying job ? Well I could if I wanted but then I’d be miserable . I can’t stand doing the same thing over and over hence why I have 3 jobs . I could make more if I wanted but I’m not trying to be any more unhappy than I am right now . Also 3 jobs gives me some sort of job security for if I ever got fired which is unlikely or if I got laid off. Me all I’ve ever wanted to do is simply blue collar work because I work best with my hands and everyday is something new unlike working 99% of jobs you have to go to college for . Don’t get me wrong I’m currently a full time pseo student at St. Paul college but I’m only doing it to get out of high school because I absolutely hate the way school is taught and the way people raise their kids these days. College isn’t much better but I do get a ton more free time which I enjoy and often times fill with work . I’m only doing it so that I can graduate about a year early and only have to go to a stupid advisory class every morning . I’m waiting until I can go to tech school (UTI) universal technical institute and learn about something I actually love and a job that there will forever be a demand for that also pays really well if you play your cards right . I believe depending on where you are of course but after gathering all of your ASE certifications your set to make atleast around $80,000 a year which I know a few people that are making over a hundred . It’s flat rate pay which most people either love or hate depending on how busy your kept but here in Minnesota we’re definitely kept pretty busy since we’re in the rust belt.",0,1729120879.0,minnesota,38,0.5,False

Given everything I've seen on reddit, I don't believe I've had an overly tough life. But boy does it feel like it sometimes. 

**My Family Picture:** I'm a 25M with three younger brothers, Dad 45M, Mum 45F, Step-Dad 44M. The youngest two brothers are from my Mum's current marriage. 

I’m not sure whether it's trauma or my lack of brain capacity, but I don't have many memories of my childhood... I’m not sure whether I blocked them out or I can't remember - can a therapist can explain this?

From the age of 5 my parents have been divorced. My mum has since re-married to my step-dad or as I call him the **Devil Incarnate**. This man has been in my life for longer than I can remember and I can honestly say I hate him, pure **visceral hate.**

He is a literal man child. My first memory of him was being sat in his gaming room, just watching as a kid and trying to give my opinion or helping him win. Next thing you know he's swearing and shouting at me, telling me to get out of the room. 

The memories of him progress from there. I remember we moved to his city and his house. Which means he had his friends there, this would result in drunken nights where he would cause arguments with my mum. To the point where he was kicking doors down, making the whole house shake and screaming the place down for no reason at all, other than he was drunk. Again this progressed to the point where he would physically hit my mum, but nothing changes after this. 

At some point my dad caught wind of what was happening in that house and as you can imagine he was not very happy. We came back to my dad's house one day during the summer holidays, to which him and my mum started arguing and it got heated to the point where my dad ended up with a coffee table over his head and throwing it across the room. This is anger, I have never seen from him before or since.

Things did get better for a little bit, when my mum moved back to our home city where she had her own house and the step-dad only came to visit to see his son. However this was shorted lived, as he soon wormed his way back into our lives. Eventually living with us again, and as you can imagine some people never change. More of the same drinking and arguing ensued for years and years.

Oddly enough I distinctly remember a lot of arguing happening on a Thursday evening. My younger brother had already had enough and left our house to live with our dad, as he hated my step-dad and resented my mum for staying with him. 

To this day I am used a communication tool between that brother and my mum, as they rarely speak so I have to try bring them together or even get them to talk. Often times I would have to comfort my youngest brothers who would be balling their eyes out in their room. 

Again arguments became physical, loud and aggressive. A lot of the times things in the house were broken from the arguments and at times my mum would have black eyes. To the point where sometimes, I would message the neighbour to call the police (not that they did). This is where I realised, there are not many people out there that will help you.

Besides, countless other things he's done when drunk, one including walking into the hall where are shoes are kept thinking it's the bathroom and pissing over all our school shoes... The day before school, with my mum having to clean up his mess.

When I was around 10 it was just me and my mum in the house. My dad and brother were at their house, which was a 5 mins walk away. I heard a glass smash downstairs and I come down to see that my mum is cutting her arm with a broken glass. I couldn't get her to stop. 

So, I had to phone my dad to help but maybe I didn't explain the urgency as my dad seemed to be taking a while to get there. So, I had to get on my bike and pedal as fast as I could to get to my dad, I met him half way and told him she was bleeding, to which he started running. He couldn't get her to stop cutting, in the end he had to threaten to calling the police before she would stop. 

Fast forward a few years, the normal cycle of arguing and drinking has continued. When I was 14 we had a street party. This included all 4 younger brothers, my mum, step-dad & his sister with her two kids. As you can imagine there was plenty of drinking going on. Again my step-dad went too far, to the point at which he was outside the house trying to dance with other women. 

My mum managed to get him in the house and us kids were now in our rooms. He was arguing and wanting to continue the party and to keep drinking, he came upstairs and threw up in the hallway, went to their bedroom and came back out the room accusing other people for throwing up, blaming everyone else in the house. Again screaming, shouting & kicking doors around the house, at this point his sister was so scared she took her kids and left. 

After which he proceeded to punch holes in the walls and TV. He then went downstairs continuing to argue, then falling into self pity ending up picking up a knife in the kitchen threatening to cut him himself (police now phoned) he continued to bellow and cry saying his kids don't love him. He did end up cutting into himself, making his arm bleed deep enough that both the police and ambulance were needed at the house to take him away. Still, my mum let him back in the house the next day, as she took care of his arm.

The cycle continues.

I think this is it for now, my younger years were the peak of the mountain for me, but that doesn’t mean this has stopped. He is still here, he may be older but his narcissitic behaviour is still plaguing our lives, as for my mum she doesn’t get any better. 

Typing has been a form of therapy for me, maybe I’ll share more in the future.

1g5cxzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/1g5cxzk/the_irony_of_howard/,The irony of Howard. ,"Spoilers ahead!! 

Howard is kind of a plain, boring guy. Mostly kind, always charismatic, well put together, very intelligent, very good with people, and yet…boring. He’s a guy who, I think, doesn’t take a lot of action or risk in his life. But there are two times when he makes big moves in the show, specifically to stand up for himself and what he believes. 

The first was ousting Chuck from the company. He did it for arguably good reason, but definitely went full tilt into the harshness of it. That ultimately is the catalyst for Chuck’s death, which traumatizes Howard and ruins the immediate future of his life, and makes the long term future of his life much harder mentally. 

The second is when he starts fighting back against Jimmy and Kim. I believe if he didn’t do that, if she just laid low, didn’t entertain Jimmy and Kim’s sick behavior, and let their little plan ride out he would have been fine. Inaction would’ve kept him out of the real crossfire. 

And so the irony of Howard is you have this really ordinary straight arrow of a guy who you want to be a more interesting character, the the couple of times he does make a big move, it fucks up and eventually ends his life.  I feel very very sad for him. 

I just watched the scene where he carefully prepares a cafe style coffee for his wife, beautifully presented, keeping the kitchen clean the whole time. His wife is clearly bored and annoyed by him, and when he has done this kind thing for her she couldn’t be bothered to appreciate it. He’s just someone with the best of intentions, and he gets shit on for it. ",5,1729120603.0,betterCallSaul,4,0.73,False

For the past 3 months, I've been ruminating about everything I've done wrong in the relationship, and it won't stop. This is affecting our relationship, and I'm afraid I might push him to break up if I don't find a way to stop. I keep thinking back to when we first met in college. We lived in the same building and that's how we met. When we met for the first time, I had so much fun, but I wasn't entirely sure. At that time, I had no experience with guys at all, only chatting online. We hung out twice, and then I went back home. During those two weeks, I started chatting online with another guy, and I really liked him because he was direct, while my current boyfriend wasn’t showing any direct signs. And during those two weeks, he didn’t text me very often. When I returned to the city where I studied, I went for coffee with this other guy, and I didn’t like him. The very next day, I started liking my current boyfriend. I keep blaming myself for not knowing right away and for even talking to someone else.

The next thing I think about is that I couldn’t open up to him about private things, and that blocked me from committing to the relationship earlier. I have alopecia and wear a wig, and I didn’t want to commit to the relationship because I felt like I was withholding something important if he didn’t know.

There are some private things I didn’t tell him until now. I felt ashamed of the fact that I live with my family in a very small apartment, share a room with my brother, and my parents sleep in the living room. Everything is pretty old. I never talked about the issues at home with my brother, who hasn’t worked in a long time. Now I realize that none of those things are abnormal or something to be ashamed of. I feel like it really affected our relationship that I couldn’t open up about it.

The last thing I regret is related to sex. But that’s actually about my need for control. It was always important to me what date we had our first kiss, the date we officially started dating, and I wanted the first time we had sex to be with rose petals, candles... I regret wanting to control all of that. So it ended up happening six months after the official start of our relationship, although we had done other things in the meantime. I feel like I made that whole beginning more difficult. I hadn’t resolved everything within myself before meeting him, and I wasn’t mature enough for a relationship, and I regret not being able to give him everything. ",2,1729120512.0,self,3,1.0,False

It’s pretty gnarly. I went for a coffee with a friend, had a very stress-relieving bitch session and now I feel grimy and disappointed with myself. The dharma talk I attended tonight was about basic goodness and how it is always present and how even small apparently neutral activities reflect our basic goodness and a desire to reconnect with that wisdom. I had a thought that even in my bitching session, that I was feeling increasingly bad about, I could choose to see it as a very human attempt to regulate my nervous system and reconnect with my higher wisdom. This has made me feel less guilty and more open to understanding the confusion of my co-workers. I would love any contributions to this topic or reading suggestions.

1g5ctak,https://www.reddit.com/r/Benophie/comments/1g5ctak/benedict_in_s4_old_and_new_ideas/,Benedict in s4: Old and new ideas,"WARNING: This is a long testament about Benedict's character. Pillows, cookies and coffee/tea are recommended. 

[What can I say? No leaks, no news!!!😒😒](https://preview.redd.it/g023u98e47vd1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9157f893a9ff8c1daa4a765b767caed4b089bb1c)

This is my speculation about Benedict in s4 and the inner difficulties he'll face as an individual. I wanted to write it after I saw this fun post about Benedict's drama/ trauma ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Benophie/comments/1g4b9mn/questions\_about\_benedict/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Benophie/comments/1g4b9mn/questions_about_benedict/)) because there are many interesting points about the character. Since I'm not too scared for Sophie because her story is dramatic enough I say let's talk about the future Mr. Baek. Some things have already been said, but I hope others are new.  

So...

Both in the book and the show Benedict's character is defined by his **second son status** and we all know this should reappear strongly in s4. I think it's interesting that the series has shown the theme in different ways: in season 1 being the spare is synonymous with freedom and responsibility. Granville says ""second sons have the fun"" and Benedict understands he can paint if he wants, but Anthony's duel with Simon reminds him the constant threat of becoming the viscount. We know Benedict would hate this because: 1) he loves his brother; 2) he has seen what responsibility has done to Anthony; 3) he doesn't have that kind of ambition. Since no one dies, the season ends with Benedict understanding his status as freedom, something that extends into season 2 until he discovers that Anthony ""bought"" his position in the Academy (at least that's what Benedict thinks). S2 Benedict is especially free because the show compares him to his brother, who is tortured by responsibilities. This works for both characters, but Anthony's intervention confirms something that Benedict has clearly already thought because society says so: that his life is inevitably determined by being the Bridgertons' second son. Benedict needs art to be personal, so he quits the Academy and painting. And then we have S3, where he seems to have assumed his role: he does what his older brother requests while he still longs for something different. When Paul asks him if he paints his ""no"" is full of shame and discomfort and he describes himself as the stereotypical useless second son. In this context the discovery of his queer identity is a joy, something that only belongs to him, but then Tilly's words haunt him in the scene where he says goodbye to Eloise: Why doesn't he want to commit? Shouldn't he want to commit to something?

This leads me to Benedict's fears and his function in the Bridgerton family. I started thinking about this after the auditon leak, where we see Benedict avoiding Sophie's curiosity in the Masquerade. I think this relates to his self-esteem and his fear of commitment. But Benedict grew up watching Violet and Edmund, why would he be afraid? Colin, Daphne and Francesca don't have this issue: Daphne and Francesca want to get married and Colin gets engaged twice in three seasons. They are all eager and in many ways they are the siblings who see marriage as their ticket to adulthood. I don't think Eloise is afraid of commitment, she just wants something else beyond marriage, that's why she's in tune with Benedict. And we know Anthony's case is openly traumatic

Benedict escapes from the debutantes and his relationships, although healthy and fun, are always with ""safe"" people, people who don't ask for commitment (this is Tilley's problem when she starts to feel jealous). And I believe this could be explained in the show in two ways: first, Benedict could be the Bridgerton who is in love with **ideal love** (at least until Gregory's chaos) because he's a lot like Violet in this aspect (this is book canon: Sophie says it and our girl is never wrong). We have seen Benedict's love theory in s1 (""what about honor... romance? with Granville), in s2 (""What is it, truly, to admire a women?"" with Anthony) and even in s3 (""throw rocks"" with John 🤣).  I have many doubts with the writers but I think they guide the siblings to the final versions of the books: Anthony is already the famously bessoted man, Colin will be the 'my wife' guy. Well in TSPWL Eloise describes Benedict as a ""dreamer"" who follows Sophie with puppy eyes so he clearly has an idealized vision of love (even Sophie is described as a fairy). That's why he doesn't believe he can find love in a place as banal as a society ball: the LIS will be exceptional because is Sophie and the masquerade doesn't follow the usual rules.

[Bye mom](https://preview.redd.it/9u2hr68q67vd1.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e798a7e8037bd1edb9064389381f7b3548d16745)

Then we have the impact of Edmund's death and what happened to Violet and Anthony. When Edmund dies they both suffer an emotional breakdown. They become distant and Benedict doesn't have the skills to intervene: he's 16-17 years old (?). What he can do is try to contain his younger siblings through simple things like being playful and listening to them.  We have seeing many examples of this in the series (see Lady Jenevia's video) and it's a good thing for the little ones. But I don't know if there was someone who contained him (I think Colins tries it now that he's an adult, but he's still the little brother and he also had this LW thing going on).

The series could show Benedict having a very, very, very late avoidant **attachment** as a result of Violet's depression. Now, I know that attachment is a childhood thing and Benedict's family big drama happens in his late teens, but it fits. People with avoidant attachment tend to flee from parental attention because parents have been absent at some point -Violet was emotionally absent (no accusations, poor Violet)-, have difficulty showing their emotions in depth (see his reaction with Sophie), feel little about the end of their relationships (Mme Delacroix, Tilly) and are afraid of commitment. I wouldn't call this a trauma, it's just the result of his family history and his position, but if the show goes along these lines the LIS disappearance is going to be Benedict's worst nightmare and the need to be with Sophie (his ""second"" real love) much more understandable. He'll open up for the first time only to be inmmediately abandoned. 'Why?' He may wonder. 'Maybe I'm not good enough?' And the same when he meets Sophie and she rejects him without explanation (because girly has her own issues). Boy is going to be desperate and with that we have come full circle: He is the second son who is scared of commitment but believes in love.

I hope everyone reading this is having a wonderful day. To get started I want to tell you a bit about myself. I am a 25 year old working professional living in Durham region. I am an avid animal lover / ethical vegan and proud mama of a Labrador Retriever. 

I would consider myself fairly well established for my age and am seeking someone who's in a similar position or at least headed in that direction. 

I enjoy a variety of different hobbies such as music, art, trying new food, coffee, gaming (especially MMOs) and TV show marathoning. I'm big into the star wars franchise right now so if you like star wars let me know! I also love really anything from Disney and especially enjoy winding down with a nice wholesome feel-good movie.

Physically I am of petite build (see 5'6"" 125lbs), blue eyes, dirty blonde shoulder length hair and very fair skinned. I am willing to exchange sfw pics once we have developed a bit of rapport with one another. 

What am I looking for?

First and foremost I am looking for a friendship based upon mutual interests and beliefs. I am looking for someone who can carry on a conversation and show some genuine interest. Preferably you are around my age or slightly older. Bonus points if you have a dad bod and are a few inches taller than me.

If I fit the brand of wacky that you're looking for please don't hesitate to message me and tell me what caught your interest. ",1,1729120117.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False

Given everything I've seen on reddit, I don't believe I've had an overly tough life. But boy does it feel like it sometimes. 

**My Family Picture:** I'm a 25M with three younger brothers, Dad 45M, Mum 45F, Step-Dad 44M. The youngest two brothers are from my Mum's current marriage.   
  
I’m not sure whether it's trauma or my lack of brain capacity, but I don't have many memories of my childhood... I’m not sure whether I blocked them out or I can't remember - can a therapist can explain this? 

From the age of 5 my parents have been divorced. My mum has since re-married to my step-dad or as I call him the **Devil Incarnate**. This man has been in my life for longer than I can remember and I can honestly say I hate him, pure **visceral hate.**  
  
He is a literal man child. My first memory of him was being sat in his gaming room, just watching as a kid and trying to give my opinion or helping him win. Next thing you know he's swearing and shouting at me, telling me to get out of the room. 

The memories of him progress from there. I remember we moved to his city and his house. Which means he had his friends there, this would result in drunken nights where he would cause arguments with my mum. To the point where he was kicking doors down, making the whole house shake and screaming the place down for no reason at all, other than he was drunk. Again this progressed to the point where he would physically hit my mum, but nothing changes after this.   
  
At some point my dad caught wind of what was happening in that house and as you can imagine he was not very happy. We came back to my dad's house one day during the summer holidays, to which him and my mum started arguing and it got heated to the point where my dad ended up with a coffee table over his head and throwing it across the room. This is anger, I have never seen from him before or since.

Things did get better for a little bit, when my mum moved back to our home city where she had her own house and the step-dad only came to visit to see his son. However this was shorted lived, as he soon wormed his way back into our lives. Eventually living with us again, and as you can imagine some people never change. More of the same drinking and arguing ensued for years and years.

Oddly enough I distinctly remember a lot of arguing happening on a Thursday evening. My younger brother had already had enough and left our house to live with our dad, as he hated my step-dad and resented my mum for staying with him. 

To this day I am used a communication tool between that brother and my mum, as they rarely speak so I have to try bring them together or even get them to talk. Often times I would have to comfort my youngest brothers who would be balling their eyes out in their room. 

Again arguments became physical, loud and aggressive. A lot of the times things in the house were broken from the arguments and at times my mum would have black eyes. To the point where sometimes, I would message the neighbour to call the police (not that they did). This is where I realised, there are not many people out there that will help you.

Besides, countless other things he's done when drunk, one including walking into the hall where are shoes are kept thinking it's the bathroom and pissing over all our school shoes... The day before school, with my mum having to clean up his mess.

When I was around 10 it was just me and my mum in the house. My dad and  brother were at their house, which was a 5 mins walk away. I heard a glass smash downstairs and I come down to see that my mum is cutting her arm with a broken glass. I couldn't get her to stop. 

So, I had to phone my dad to help but maybe I didn't explain the urgency as my dad seemed to be taking a while to get there. So, I had to get on my bike and pedal as fast as I could to get to my dad, I met him half way and told him she was bleeding, to which he started running. He couldn't get her to stop cutting, in the end he had to threaten to calling the police before she would stop. 

Fast forward a few years, the normal cycle of arguing and drinking has continued. When I was 14 we had a street party. This included all 4 younger brothers, my mum, step-dad & his sister with her two kids. As you can imagine there was plenty of drinking going on. Again my step-dad went too far, to the point at which he was outside the house trying to dance with other women. 

My mum managed to get him in the house and us kids were now in our rooms. He was arguing and wanting to continue the party and to keep drinking, he came upstairs and threw up in the hallway, went to their bedroom and came back out the room accusing other people for throwing up, blaming everyone else in the house. Again screaming, shouting & kicking doors around the house, at this point his sister was so scared she took her kids and left. 

After which he proceeded to punch holes in the walls and TV. He then went downstairs continuing to argue, then falling into self pity ending up picking up a knife in the kitchen threatening to cut him himself (police now phoned) he continued to bellow and cry saying his kids don't love him. He did end up cutting into himself, making his arm bleed deep enough that both the police and ambulance were needed at the house to take him away. Still, my mum let him back in the house the next day, as she took care of his arm. 

The cycle continues.  
  
I think this is it for now, my younger years were the peak of the mountain for me, but that doesn’t mean this has stopped. He is still here, he may be older but his narcissitic behaviour is still plaguing our lives, as for my mum she doesn’t get any better.   
  
Typing has been a form of therapy for me, maybe I’ll share more in the future. 

Thank you to those to took the time to read it. If you have unfortunately related to this or are going through the same thing, I hope you have a good support network around you and you are taking the time to heal.

---------------------------------------------------

When it comes to small house design, the term ""luxurious"" may seem at odds with the limited square footage. However, innovative elements can transform compact spaces into stunning, high-end homes. Maximizing elegance and functionality can truly elevate the small living experience. Here are some key aspects that define luxurious small house design.

### Smart Space Utilization

In a luxurious small house, every inch counts. Innovative design techniques ensure that spaces serve multiple purposes. For example, **multi-functional furniture** can play a pivotal role. This includes:

- **Convertible sofas:** Transforming from a stylish lounge to a guest bed.
- **Hidden storage:** Utilizing under-bed spaces or built-in cabinets that blend seamlessly with the décor.
- **Extendable dining tables:** Ideal for entertaining, expanding as needed without dominating the room when not in use.

### Natural Light Integration

Natural light enhances both the aesthetic and the perceived spaciousness of a home. Large windows, skylights, and open floor plans are prime examples of how to incorporate this element. Consider incorporating:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/luxurious-small-house-design  
  
- **Floor-to-ceiling windows:** These create a seamless transition between the indoors and outdoors, making spaces feel larger.
- **Transom windows:** Placed above sightlines to allow additional light without losing privacy.
- **Light wells:** Effective in adding brightness to darker areas without requiring wall space.

### Minimalist Aesthetic

A luxurious small house thrives on a minimalist aesthetic. This doesn’t mean sacrificing style; instead, it's about selecting fewer, but high-quality items. Focus on:

- **Statement pieces:** Opt for one or two eye-catching decor items that draw attention.
- **Neutral color palettes:** Soft hues can make spaces feel more open and airy.
- **Clean lines:** Simple shapes and uncluttered spaces promote tranquility and elegance.

### Eco-Friendly Features

Modern luxury extends beyond aesthetics to include sustainability. Innovative eco-friendly elements significantly enhance both function and luxury in small house design. Some features to consider are:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/luxurious-small-house-design  
  
- **Solar panels:** Harnessing energy not only saves costs but also supports green living.
- **Energy-efficient appliances:** Selecting high-efficiency models reduces utility expenses and environmental impact.
- **Green roofs or living walls:** These can benefit air quality while offering a stunning visual appeal.

### Outdoor Living Spaces

Creating a seamless connection with nature can make small homes feel expansive. Thoughtfully designed outdoor spaces can serve as extensions of your living area. Consider including:

- **Outdoor kitchens:** Complete with grills, sinks, and counter space to enhance entertaining.
- **Decks or patios:** Comfortable seating areas that encourage relaxation amidst nature.
- **Vertical gardens:** These maximize planting space while providing a natural aesthetic.

### Advanced Technology

Technology transforms a small house into a luxurious haven. Smart home features promote convenience and security. Specific examples include:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/luxurious-small-house-design  
  
- **Smart lighting systems:** Automate lighting based on your schedule or according to the time of day.
- **Home security systems:** Advanced tech provides peace of mind while maintaining aesthetics.
- **Climate control:** Smart thermostats adjust temperatures based on occupancy, maximizing comfort and efficiency.

In essence, the innovative elements of luxurious small house design are all about maximizing space while incorporating style and functionality. By embracing smart design choices, integrating nature, and harnessing technology, you can create a high-end living experience that feels spacious, inviting, and uniquely your own. Whether you are designing a new home or upgrading your current one, implementing these strategies will lead to a beautifully crafted, luxurious small house that stands out.

Maximizing Functionality in Compact Luxury Living Spaces
--------------------------------------------------------

Living in a compact space doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice style or comfort. With the rise of luxurious small house designs, homeowners can enjoy the best of both worlds—elegance and efficiency. Maximizing functionality in these compact luxury living spaces is all about smart choices in layout, furniture, and design elements. Let’s explore how to make the most of your small luxury home.

### Smart Layout Design

The foundation of effective compact living begins with a thoughtful layout. Here are some great tips to consider:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/luxurious-small-house-design  
  
- **Open Floor Plan:** Combining living, dining, and kitchen areas creates an inviting flow and makes the space feel larger.
- **Multi-Functional Rooms:** Design a space that can serve multiple purposes, such as a home office that doubles as a guest bedroom.
- **Integrated Storage:** Utilize built-in shelves and cabinets to avoid clutter while keeping essential items easily accessible.

### Furniture Selection

Choosing the right furniture is crucial in a small luxury home. Opt for pieces that blend function with aesthetics:

- **Scale and Proportion:** Select furniture that matches the size of your space. Large, bulky items can overwhelm a compact room.
- **Multi-Functional Pieces:** Invest in furniture that serves more than one purpose. Consider coffee tables with storage or sofa beds for guests.
- **Elegant Materials:** Choose high-quality materials to elevate your space. Think along the lines of plush velvet or sleek leather to add a touch of luxury.

### Color Palette and Lighting

Color and lighting significantly influence the mood and perceived size of a small space:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/luxurious-small-house-design  
  
- **Light Colors:** Soft hues, such as whites, creams, and pastels, can help your space feel airy and open.
- **Accent Walls:** Create visual interest with an accent wall using bold colors or wallpaper without closing in the space.
- **Layered Lighting:** Use a mix of ambient, task, and accent lighting to brighten up your home. Wall sconces and recessed lighting can enhance functionality without taking up surface area.

### Custom Storage Solutions

Storage is essential in a small luxury home. Custom solutions can turn inconvenient spaces into valuable storage areas:

- **Under-Stair Storage:** Utilize the space beneath stairs to add shelves or cabinets.
- **Murphy Beds:** These foldable beds are perfect for maximizing floor space during the day.
- **Utilizing Vertical Space:** Don’t forget walls! High shelves and tall bookcases can store items without compromising floor space.

### Outdoor Living

Enhancing your compact home doesn't stop indoors; outdoor spaces can also add a luxurious feel. Consider these options:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/luxurious-small-house-design  
  
- **Patio Areas:** Create a functional outdoor area for dining and relaxing. Stylish furniture can make a small patio feel like a luxurious retreat.
- **Vertical Gardens:** Bringing greenery into your small space can improve air quality and add beauty. Vertical gardens are perfect for limited areas.
- **Balcony Furniture:** If you have a balcony, make it cozy with compact, fashionable furniture. Include pillows and plants for a welcoming atmosphere.

### Choosing Accessories Wisely

Accessories can elevate the overall aesthetic of your small luxury home. Here’s how to be strategic:

- **Statement Art Pieces:** A single stunning artwork can serve as a focal point and bring personality to the room.

Recommend:
- NYHC - Rettman, great introduction and covers a lot of ground. Any Rettman book is great (Why be something you’re not and Straight Edge are both dope too)
- Burning Fight - Peterson, covers heaps of the 90s
- JJ/Harley books, both are really fun and full of lies. The cro mags were better before the internet. 
- H8000 - Verbeke, great read and full of heaps of cool photos 
- Queercore - Warfield, Crasshole & Leyser, fascinating read 

Don’t bother:
- Total Revolution, Eeyore. Poorly edited
- X, Kuhn. Sober Living For The Revolution is great and this just wasn’t. 
- From Punk To Monk, Cappo. 300 pages just to convert you to Krishna that just glosses over the punk parts. 
- Hardcore America, Blush. From an era when there wasn’t a lot of books around, not a bad intro but skippable. 

Good coffee table books:
- Record Aficionado, tumbled leather. 
- Touch And Go, TV & DS
- Radio Silence, Nedorostek & Pappalardo

Looking forward to: 
- Ancient Artifax
- Cut And Paste
- Orstalia, a punk history

1g5cdm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g5cdm3/my_mother_hasnt_been_the_same_since_i_found_an/,My mother hasn't been the same since I found an old recipe book,"When I got the call that my uncle had been arrested again, I wasn’t surprised. He was charming, reckless, and unpredictable—the kind of guy who knew his way around trouble and didn’t seem to mind it. But this time felt different. It wasn’t just a few months; he was facing ten years. A decade behind bars, for possession of over a pound of cocaine. They said it was hidden in the trunk of his car, packed away as casually as groceries. 



It stung. He’d promised us he was clean, that his wild years were behind him. Even at Thanksgiving, he’d go out of his way to remind us all that he was on the straight and narrow. We’d had our doubts—old habits don’t vanish overnight, after all. But a pound? None of us had seen that coming. My uncle swore up and down the drugs weren’t his, said he was framed, that someone wanted to see him gone for good. But when we pressed him on it, he’d just clam up, muttering that spending a decade locked away was better than what ""they"" would do to him.



After he was sentenced, my mom called, her voice tight, asking if I could go to his place and sort through his things. It was typical family duty—the kind of thing I couldn’t turn down. I wasn’t close with him, but family ties run deep enough to leave you feeling responsible, even when you know you shouldn’t.



So, with him locked away for the next ten years, I volunteered to clear out his apartment, move his things to storage. I didn’t know why I was so eager, but maybe I felt like it was the least I could do. The place was a disaster, exactly as I expected. His kitchen cupboards were filled with thrift-store pots and pans, each one more scratched and mismatched than the last. I could see him at the stove, cigarette dangling from his lips, stirring whatever random meal he’d thrown together in those beat-up pans.



The living room was its own kind of graveyard. Ashtrays covered nearly every surface, filled with weeks’ worth of cigarette butts, and the walls were a deep, sickly yellow from years of constant smoke. Even the light switches had turned the same shade, crusted over from the nasty habit that had stained every inch of the place. It was clear he hadn’t cracked a window in years. I found myself running my fingers along the walls, almost wondering if the yellow residue would come off. It didn’t.



In one corner of the room was his pride and joy: a collection of *Star Trek* figurines and posters, lined up on a crooked shelf he’d likely hammered up himself. He’d been a fan for as long as I could remember, always rambling about episodes I’d never seen and characters I couldn’t name. Dozens of plastic figures with blank, determined stares watched me pack up their home, my uncle’s treasures boxed up and ready to be hidden away for who knew how long.



It took a few days, but I finally got the majority of the place packed. Three trips in my truck, hauling boxes and crates to the storage facility across town, until the apartment was stripped bare. The only things left were the stained carpet, the nicotine-coated walls, and the broken blinds barely hanging in the windows. There was no way he was getting his security deposit back; the damage was practically baked into the place. But it didn’t matter anymore.



As I sorted through the last of the kitchen, my hand brushed against something tucked away in the shadows of the cabinet. I pulled it out and found myself holding a small, leather-bound book. The cover was cracked and worn, the leather soft from age, with a faint smell of cigarette smoke clinging to it. The pages inside were yellowed, brittle, and marked with years of kitchen chaos—stains, smudges, and scribbled notes everywhere.



The entries were scattered, written down in no particular order, almost as if whoever kept this book had jotted recipes down the moment they’d been created, without thought of organization. As I skimmed the pages, a feeling crept over me that this book might have belonged to my grandfather. He was the one who’d brought the family together, year after year, with his homemade dishes. Every holiday felt anchored by the meals he’d cooked, recipes no one had ever been able to quite replicate. This book could very well hold the secrets to those meals, a piece of him that had somehow made its way into my uncle’s hands after my grandfather passed. And yet…



I couldn’t shake a strange sense of dread as I held it. The leather was cold against my hands, almost damp, and a chill worked its way through me as I turned the pages. It felt \*wrong\*, somehow, as if there was more in this book than family recipes.



Curious about the book’s origins, I brought it to my mom. She took one look at the looping handwriting on the yellowed pages and nodded, her face softening with recognition. ""This was your grandfather's,"" she said, almost reverently, tracing her fingers along the ink. She hadn’t seen it in years, and when I told her where I'd found it, a look of surprise flickered across her face. She had been searching for the book for ages and had never realized her brother had kept it all this time.  



As she flipped through the pages, nostalgia mingled with something else—maybe a touch of sadness or reverence. I could tell this book meant a lot to her, which only strengthened my resolve to preserve it. “Could I hang onto it a little longer?” I asked. “I want to scan it, make a digital copy for myself, so we don’t lose any of his recipes.”



My mom agreed without hesitation, grateful that I was taking the time to safeguard something she hadn’t known was still around. So I got to work. Over the next few weeks, in the gaps of my day-to-day life, I carefully scanned each page. I wasn’t too focused on the content itself, more concerned with making sure each recipe was clear and legible, and didn’t pay close attention to the strange ingredients and odd notes scattered throughout. My only goal was to make the text accessible, giving life to a digital copy that would be preserved indefinitely.



Once I finished, I spent a few hours merging the scanned images, piecing them together to create a seamless digital version. When it was finally done, I returned the original to my mom, feeling a strange mix of relief and satisfaction. The family recipes were now safe, and I thought that was the end of it. But that sense of unease I’d felt in the kitchen, holding that worn leather cover, lingered longer than I expected.



In the months that followed, I didn’t think much about the recipe book. Scanning it had been a small side project, the kind I’d meant to follow up on by actually cooking a few of my grandfather’s old dishes. But like so many side projects, I got wrapped up in other things and the book’s contents drifted to the back of my mind, filed away and forgotten.



Then Thanksgiving rolled around. I made my way to my parents’ place, expecting the usual—turkey, stuffing, and the familiar spread that had become tradition. When I got there, though, I noticed something different right away. A large bird sat in the middle of the table, roasted to perfection, but something about it didn’t look right. It was too small for a turkey, and its skin looked darker, almost rougher than the golden-brown I was used to.  



“Nice chicken,” I said, figuring they’d switched things up for a change. My mom just shook her head.



“It’s not a chicken,” she said quietly. “It’s a hen.”



I gave her a confused look. “What’s the difference?” I asked, half-laughing, expecting her to shrug it off with a quick explanation. Instead, she just stared at me, her eyes unfocused as if she were lost in thought. 



For a moment, her face seemed distant, almost blank, as though I’d asked a question she couldn’t quite place. Then, suddenly, she blinked, her gaze snapping back to me. “It’s just… what the recipe called for,” she said, a strange edge to her voice.



Something about it made the hair on my arms prickle, but I pushed the feeling aside, figuring she’d just been caught up in the cooking chaos. Yet, as I looked at the bird again, a small flicker of unease crept in, settling in the back of my mind like an itch I couldn’t scratch.



After dinner, I pulled my dad aside in the kitchen while my mom finished clearing the table. ""What’s the deal with Mom tonight?"" I asked, keeping my voice low. He just shrugged, brushing it off with a wave of his hand.



“You know how your mother is,” he said with a small smile, as though her strange excitement was just one of those quirks. He didn’t give it a second thought, already moving on.



But I couldn’t shake the weirdness. The whole meal had been… off. The hen, unlike anything we’d had before, was coated in a sweet-smelling sauce that seemed to have a faint hint of walnut to it, almost masking its pale, ashen hue. The bird lay on a bed of unfamiliar greens—probably some sort of garnish—alongside perfectly sliced parsnips and radishes that seemed too neatly arranged, like it was all meant to look a certain way. The whole thing was far too elaborate for my mom’s usual Thanksgiving style.



When she finally sat, she led us in saying grace, her voice soft and reverent. As she began cutting into the hen, a strange glint of excitement lit up her face, one I wasn’t used to seeing. She served it up, watching each of us intently as we took our first bites. I wasn’t sure what I expected, but as I brought a piece to my mouth, I could tell right away this wasn’t the usual Thanksgiving fare. The meat was tough—almost stringy—and didn’t pull apart easily, a far cry from the tender turkey or even chicken I was used to.



Mom kept glancing between my dad and me with a kind of eager glee, as though she were waiting for us to say something. It was unsettling, her eyes wide, as if she were waiting for us to uncover some hidden secret.



When I finally asked, “What’s got you so excited, Mom?” she just smiled, her expression softening.



“Oh, it’s just… this cookbook you found from Grandpa’s things. It’s like having a part of him here with every meal I make.” She spoke with a reverence I hadn’t heard in her voice for a long time, as though she were talking about more than just food.



I gave her a nod, trying to humor her. “Tastes good,” I said, hoping she’d ease up. “I enjoyed it.” But in truth, I wished we’d had a more familiar Thanksgiving dinner. The meal wasn’t exactly bad, but something tasted a little off. I couldn’t put my finger on it, and maybe I didn’t want to.



After we finished, I said my goodbyes and headed home, trying to shake the lingering sense of unease. My mom’s face, her excitement, kept replaying in my mind. And then there was the hen itself. Why a hen? Why the pale, ashen sauce? There was something almost ritualistic in the way she’d prepared it, a strange precision I’d never seen from her before.



The night stretched on, the questions gnawing at me, taking root in a way that wouldn’t let me rest.



When I got home, I couldn’t shake the weird feeling from dinner. I sat down at my desk, opening the scanned file I’d saved to my desktop months ago. The folder had been sitting there, untouched, and now that I finally had it open, I could see why I’d put it off. The handwriting was dense and intricate, almost a kind of calligraphy, each letter curling into the next. The words seemed to dance across the pages in a strange, whimsical flow. I had to squint, leaning closer to make sense of each line.



As I scrolled through the recipes, a chill ran down my spine. They had unsettling names, the kind that felt more like old spells than recipes. \*Mother’s Last Supper Porridge\*, \*Binding Broth of Bone and Leaf\*, \*Elders’ Emberbread\*, \*Hollow Heart Soup with Mourning Onion.\* I wasn’t sure if it was my imagination, but I could almost feel a heaviness creeping into the room, the words themselves holding an eerie energy. 



Then, I found it—the recipe for the dish my mother had made tonight: \*Ancestor’s Offering\*. The recipe was titled in that same swirling calligraphy, and I felt a knot tighten in my stomach as I read the description. It was for a Maple-Braised Hen with Black Walnut and Root Purée, though it didn’t sound like any recipe I’d ever seen. The instructions were worded strangely, written in a style that made it feel centuries old. Each ingredient was listed with specific purpose and detail, as though it held some secret power.



My eyes skimmed down to the meat. It specified a hen, not just any chicken. “The body must be that of a mother,” it read. I felt a shiver go through me, remembering the strange way my mom had insisted on using a hen, correcting me when I’d casually referred to it as chicken. 



The instructions continued, noting that the hen had to be served on a bed of Lamb’s lettuce—a type of honeysuckle, according to a quick Google search. And then, as I read further, a chill seeped into my bones. The recipe stated it must be served “just before the end of twilight, as dusk yields to night.” I thought back to dinner, and the way we’d all sat down just as the last of the sun’s light faded beyond the horizon.



But the final instruction was the worst part, and as I read it, my stomach twisted in revulsion. The recipe called for something it referred to as \*Ancestor’s Salt\*. The note at the bottom explained that this “salt” was a sprinkle of the ashes of “those who have returned to the earth,” with a warning to use it sparingly, as “each grain remembers the one who offered it.”



I sat back, cold sweat breaking out across my skin as I recalled the pale, ashen sauce coating the hen, the faint, sweet scent it gave off. My mind raced, piecing together what it implied. Had my mom actually used… ashes in the meal? Had she… used my grandfather’s ashes?



I tried to shake it off, to tell myself it was just some old folklore nonsense. But the image of her smiling face as she served us that meal, the gleam in her eyes, crept back into my mind. I felt my stomach churn, bile rising in my throat as the horrifying thought sank deeper.



A few days later, the gnawing unease had become impossible to ignore. I told myself I was probably just overreacting, that the weird details in the recipe were nothing more than some strange family tradition I didn’t understand. Still, I couldn’t shake the dread that crept up every time I remembered that meal. So, I decided to call my mom. I planned it out, careful to come off as casual. The last thing I wanted was for her to think I was accusing her of something as insane as putting ashes in our food.



I asked about my dad, about her gardening, anything to warm her up a bit. Then I thanked her for the Thanksgiving dinner, even going so far as to say it was the best we’d had in years. When I finally brought up the recipe book, her voice brightened instantly.



“Oh, thank you again for finding it!” she said, sounding genuinely pleased. “I had no idea he’d cataloged so many wonderful recipes. I knew your grandfather’s cooking was special, but to have all these dishes recorded, like his own little legacy—it’s been such a joy.”



I chuckled, trying to keep my tone light. “I actually looked up that dish you made us, \*Ancestor’s Offering\*. Thought maybe I’d give it a try myself sometime.” 



“Oh, really?” she replied, sounding intrigued.



“Yeah, though I thought it was a little strange the recipe specifically calls for a hen and not just a regular chicken, since they’re so much tougher. And the part that says it should be ‘the body of a mother’…” I let the words hang, hoping she’d jump in with some explanation that would make it all seem less… sinister.



For a moment, there was just silence on her end. Then, quietly, she said, “Well, that’s just how your grandfather wrote it, I suppose.” Her voice was different now, lower, as if she were carefully choosing her words.



My heart thumped in my chest, and I decided to press a little further. “I also noticed it calls for something called \*Ancestor’s Salt\*,” I said, feigning confusion, pretending I hadn’t read the footnote that explicitly described it. “What’s that supposed to be?”



The silence was even longer this time, stretching out until it became a ringing hum in my ears. When she finally spoke, her voice was barely a whisper.



“I… I have to go,” she murmured, sounding almost dazed.



Before I could respond, the line clicked, leaving me in the heavy, stunned quiet. I tried calling her back immediately, but it went straight to voicemail. Her phone was off.



My stomach twisted as I stared at the blank screen. I couldn’t tell if I was more scared of what I might find out or of what I might already know.



I hesitated, but eventually called my dad’s phone, feeling a need to at least check in. When he picked up, I told him about my call with Mom and how strange she’d been acting.



“She went into her garden right after you two spoke,” he said, sounding unconcerned. “Started tending to her plants, hasn’t said a word since.”



I tried nudging him a bit, asking if he could maybe get her to talk to me, but he just brushed it off. “You’re overreacting. You know how your mother is—gets all sentimental over family things. It’ll just upset her if you keep nagging her about it. Give her some space.”



I nodded, trying to take his advice to heart. “Yeah… alright. You’re probably right.”



After we hung up, I resolved to let it go and went about my day, chalking it up to my mom’s usual habit of getting overly attached to anything with sentimental value. She’d always treated family heirlooms like they carried something sacred, almost magical. But this time, I couldn’t fully shake the nagging feeling in the back of my mind, something that made it impossible to forget about that recipe book.



Eventually, curiosity got the better of me. Sitting back down at my computer, I opened the digital copy and scrolled aimlessly through the pages. Part of me knew it was a bad idea, but I couldn’t resist. I let the file skip down to a random section, thinking I’d try making something small, something harmless. As I scrolled, I found myself staring at the very last page, which held a recipe titled \*Elders’ Emberbread.\*



The instructions were minimal, yet each word seemed heavy, steeped in purpose. Beneath the title, a note read: “Best served in small portions on cold, dark nights. The taste is best enjoyed alone—lest the voices of the past linger too long.” 



I shook my head, half-amused, half-unnerved. It was all nonsense, I told myself, probably just some old superstitions my grandfather had picked up along the way. But something about it had my heart pounding just a bit harder. Ignoring the rising chill, I printed the recipe and took it to the kitchen. I’d play along, I figured. It was just bread, after all.



I scanned the list of ingredients for \*Elders’ Emberbread\*, feeling time slip away as though I’d been pulled into some strange trance. My mind blurred over, details of the process fading into a fog, yet I couldn’t stop moving. I gathered everything without really thinking about it, each step drawing me deeper, as though I were following some ancient, well-worn path. I remembered flashes—the sweet scent of elderberry and honey, the earthy weight of raw rye, the dry, pungent aroma of wood burnt to charcoal. At some point, I murmured something under my breath, words of thanks to my ancestors that I hadn’t consciously decided to speak.



The smell of warmed goat’s milk lingered in the air, blending with a creamy, thick butter that had blackened over low heat. A faint scent of yew ash drifted up as I worked, curling into my nose like smoke from an unseen fire.



By the time I came to my senses, night had fallen, the kitchen shadowed and still. And there, sitting on the counter, was the bread: a dark, dense loaf, blackened at the crust but glistening with an almost unnatural sheen. It looked rich and moist, and as I stared at it, a strange sense of pride swelled up within me, unnatural and unsettling, like a voice in the back of my mind was urging me to feel pleased, insisting that I’d done well.



Without really thinking, I cut myself a slice and carried it to the living room, feeling compelled to “enjoy” my creation. I took a bite, and the bread filled my mouth with an earthy, bittersweet taste, smoky yet tinged with a subtle berry sweetness. It was… unusual, nothing like I’d ever tasted before, but it was oddly satisfying. 



As I chewed, a warmth bloomed deep in my chest, spreading through me like the steady heat of a wood stove. It was comforting, almost intimate, as if the bread itself were warming me from the inside out. Before I knew it, I’d finished the entire slice. Not because I’d particularly enjoyed it, but because some strange sense of obligation had pushed me to finish every bite.



When I set the plate down, the warmth remained, a heavy presence settled deep inside me. And in the silence that followed, I could have sworn I felt a faint, rhythmic beat—a heartbeat, steady and ancient, pulsing faintly beneath my skin.



Over the next few weeks, I found myself drawn back to the \*Elders’ Emberbread\* more often than I intended. I’d notice myself in the kitchen, knife in hand, halfway through slicing a thick piece from the loaf before even realizing I’d gotten up to do it. It was instinctive, almost as if some quiet impulse guided me back to it on those quiet, late nights.



Each time I took a bite, that same deep warmth would swell inside me, radiating outward like embers glowing from a steady fire. But unlike the hen my mother had made—a meal that left me with a lingering sense of discomfort—the Emberbread felt different. It was as though each bite carried something I couldn’t quite place, something familiar and almost affectionate, like a labor of love embedded into every grain.



The days blended together, but the questions didn’t go away. I tried to reach out to my mother several times, hoping she might open up about the recipe book, maybe explain why we both seemed so drawn to these strange meals. But each time I brought it up, she’d evade the question, either changing the subject or claiming she was too busy to talk.



She hadn’t invited me over for dinner since Thanksgiving, and the distance between us felt like a slow, widening gulf. Even my dad, when I’d asked about her, shrugged it off, saying she was “just going through a phase.” But the coldness in her responses, her repeated avoidance of the book, only made me more certain that there was something she wasn’t telling me.



Still, I kept returning to the Emberbread, feeling its subtle pull each time the sun set, as though I were being guided by something unseen. And each time I took a bite, it felt less like a meal and more like… communion, a quiet bond that was growing stronger with every piece I consumed.



After weeks of unanswered questions, I decided to reach out to my uncle at the prison. I was allowed to leave a message, so I kept it short—told him it was his nephew, wished him well, and let him know I’d left him a hundred bucks in commissary. The next day, he called me back, his voice scratchy over the line but appreciative.



“Hey, thanks for the cash,” he said with a short chuckle. “You know how it is in here—money makes things easier.”



We chatted for a bit, catching up. He’d been in and out of prison so often that I’d come to see it as his way of life. In his sixties now, he talked about his time behind bars with a kind of acceptance, almost relief. “By the time I’m out again, I’ll be an old man,” he said, almost amused. “It’s not the worst place to grow old.”



Then I took a breath and brought up the reason I’d called. “I don’t know if you remember, but when I was packing up your place, I found this old recipe book.” I hesitated, then quickly added, “I, uh, gave it to Mom. Thought she’d get a kick out of it.”



His response was immediate. The warm, casual tone in his voice shifted, growing cold and sharp. “Listen to me,” he said, each word weighted and deliberate. “If you have that book, you need to throw it into a fire.”



“What?” I stammered, caught off guard. “It’s just a cookbook.”



“It’s not ‘just a cookbook,’” he replied, his voice low, almost trembling. “That book… it brings out terrible things in people.” He paused, as though considering how much to say. “My father—your grandfather—he was into some dark stuff, stuff you don’t just find in the back of an old family recipe. And that book?” He took a breath. “That book wasn’t his. It belonged to \*his\* mother, your great-grandmother, passed down to him before he even knew what it was. My mother used to say those recipes were meant for desperate times.”



The gravity of his words settled into me, and I felt the weight of it all suddenly make sense.



“They were used to survive hard times,” he continued, voice quiet. “You’ve heard about what people did during the Great Depression, how desperate families were… but this?” He exhaled sharply. “Those recipes are ancient. Passed down through whispers and word of mouth long before they were ever written down. But they’re not for everyday meals. They’re for… invoking things, bringing things out. The kind of things that can take hold of you if you’re not careful.”



My hand tightened around the phone as a cold shiver traced down my spine, my mind flashing back to the Emberbread, the warmth it had left in my chest, the strange satisfaction that hadn’t felt entirely my own.



“Promise me,” he continued, his voice almost pleading. “Don’t let Mom or anyone else use that book for anything casual. Those recipes can keep a person alive in hard times, sure, but they weren’t meant to be used… not unless you’re ready to live with the consequences.” 



A chill settled over me as I realized just how deep this all went.



I hesitated, then told my uncle the truth—I’d already made one of the recipes. I described \*Elders’ Emberbread\* to him, the earthy sweetness, the warmth it filled me with, leaving out the part about how I’d almost felt compelled to eat it. He let out a harsh sigh and scolded me, his voice sharper than I’d ever heard. “You shouldn’t have touched that bread. None of it. Do you understand me?”



I felt a pang of guilt. “I know… I’m sorry. I promise, I won’t make anything else from the book.”



“Good,” he said, his voice calming a little. “But that’s not enough. You have to get that book away from my sister—your mother—before she does something she can’t take back.”



I tried to assure him I’d do what I could, but he cut me off, his tone deadly serious. “You \*need\* to do this. Something bad will happen if you don’t.”



Over the next few weeks, as Christmas approached, I stayed in touch with him, paying the collect call fees to keep our conversations going. Every time we talked, the discussion would circle back to the book. I’d tell him about my progress, or lack of it—how I’d tried visiting my mom, only for her to brush me off with excuses, saying she was too busy or that it wasn’t a good time. And each time I talked to her, she seemed to grow colder, more distant, as if that recipe book were slowly casting a shadow over her.



One day, I decided to drop by without any notice at all. When I showed up on her doorstep, she didn’t seem pleased to see me. “You should’ve called first,” she said with a forced smile. “It’s rude, you know, just showing up like this.” Her tone was tight, her words clipped.



I tried to play it off, shrugging and saying I’d just missed her and wanted to check in. But as I scanned the house, I felt a creeping sense of unease. I looked for any sign of the book, hoping I could find it and take it with me, but it was nowhere to be seen. Each time, I’d leave empty-handed, feeling like I was being watched from the shadows as I walked out the door.



Every call with my uncle became more urgent, his insistence that I retrieve the book growing into a kind of desperation. “You have to try harder,” he’d say, his voice strained. “If you don’t get that book away from her, \*something’s going to happen.\* You have to believe me.”



And deep down, I did believe him. The memory of the Emberbread, the strange warmth, and the subtle pull of that old recipe gnawed at me, as though warning me of something far worse waiting in that book. But it was more than that—something in my mom’s voice, her distant gaze, even her scolding felt \*off\*. And every time I left her house, I felt a chill settle over me, like I was getting closer to something I wasn’t prepared to see.



Christmas Day finally arrived, and despite my mother’s recent evasions, there was no avoiding me this time. I gathered up the presents I’d bought for them, packed them into my car, and drove to their house, hoping the tension that had grown between us would somehow ease in the warmth of the holiday.



When I knocked, she opened the door and offered a quick, halfhearted hug. The scent of baked ham and sweet glaze wafted out, thick and rich, and for a second, I thought maybe she’d set aside that strange recipe book and returned to her usual cooking. I relaxed a little, hoping the day would be less tense than I’d feared.



“Where’s Dad?” I asked, glancing around for any sign of him.



“Oh, he’s in the garage,” she said, waving it off. “Got a new gadget he’s fussing over, you know him.” She gestured toward the dining room, where plates and holiday decorations were already set up. “Why don’t you sit down? Lunch is almost ready.”



I took off my coat, glancing back at her. She was already turned away, busying herself with the last touches on the table, and I couldn’t help but feel a pang of discomfort. Her movements were stiff, almost mechanical, and I could sense the familiar warmth in her was missing. It was like she was there but somehow… \*absent\*.



Not wanting to disobey my mother on Christmas, I placed my gifts with the others under the tree and took my seat at the dining table. The plate in front of me was polished and waiting, a silver fork and knife perfectly aligned on either side, but the emptiness of it left an unsettling pit in my stomach.



“Should I go get Dad?” I called out, glancing back toward the hallway that led to the garage. He’d usually be the first to greet me, especially on a holiday. The silence from him was off-putting.



“He’ll come when he’s ready,” my mother replied, her voice carrying from the kitchen. “He had a big breakfast, so he can join us later. Let’s go ahead and start.”



Something about her response didn’t sit right. It wasn’t like my dad to skip a Christmas meal, not for any reason. A small, insistent thought tugged at me—maybe it was the book again, casting shadows over everything in my mind, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong.



“I’ll just go say hello to him,” I said, rising from the table.



Before I’d even taken a step, she entered the dining room, carrying a large ham on an ornate silver platter. The meat was dark and glossy, almost blackened, the glaze thick and rich, coating every criss-crossed cut she’d made in the skin. The bone jutted out starkly from the center, pale against the charred flesh.



“Sit down,” she said, her voice oddly stern, a hint of irritation slipping through her usual holiday warmth. “This is a special meal. We should enjoy it together.”



I stopped, glancing from her to the closed door of the garage, the words “special meal” repeating in my head, setting off warning bells. Still, I stood my ground, my stomach churning.



“I just want to see Dad, that’s all. I haven’t even said hello.”



Her face tensed, her grip tightening around the platter as her voice rose. “\*Sit down\* and enjoy lunch with me.” The words hung in the air, heavy and unyielding, like a command I was supposed to follow without question.



But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something terrible was lying just beneath the surface of her insistence.



“No,” I snapped, my voice echoing through the dining room. “I’ve had enough of this, Mom! You’ve been obsessed with that damn recipe book, and I’m done with it.” My heart pounded as I looked at her, my words hanging thick in the silence, but I didn’t back down. “I’m going to the garage to get Dad. We’re putting an end to this right now.”



Her face contorted, desperation spilling from her eyes. “Please, just sit down,” she pleaded, her voice cracking as she looked at the untouched plate in front of me. “Let’s have this meal together. It’s… it’s important.”



I took a step toward the garage, determined to get my dad out here, to make him see how far she’d gone. That book had wormed its way too deep into her mind. She shrieked and threw herself in front of the door, arms outstretched as if to block my path. Her face was flushed, her voice frantic.



“\*Don’t go in there.\* Please, just sit down. Enjoy the meal, savor it,” she begged, her hands trembling as she reached out, practically pleading. There was a desperation in her voice that sounded like fear, not just of me but of what lay beyond that door.



“Mom, you’re acting crazy! We need to talk, and I need to see Dad.” I tried to push past her, but she held her ground, her body a thin, shaky barrier.



“\*Please,\*” she whispered, voice thin and desperate. “You don’t understand. Don’t disturb him—”



“Dad!” I called out, raising my voice over her pleas. Silence answered at first, followed by a muffled sound—a low, guttural moan, thick and unnatural, rising from the other side of the door. I froze, my blood turning cold as the sound slipped into a horrible, wet gurgle. My mother’s face went white, her eyes wide with terror as she realized I’d heard him.



I felt a surge of adrenaline take over, and before she could react, I shoved her aside and yanked open the door. 



The sight that met me would be seared into my memory forever.



I stepped into the garage and froze, my stomach lurching at the scene before me. My dad lay sprawled across his workbench, his face pale and slick with sweat. His right leg was tied tightly with a belt just above the thigh, a makeshift tourniquet attempting to staunch the flow of blood. A pillowcase was wrapped around the raw, exposed flesh where his leg had been crudely severed, and blood pooled on the concrete floor beneath him, glistening in the cold fluorescent light.



He lifted his head weakly, his eyes glassy and unfocused. His mouth moved, trying to form words, a barely audible rasp escaping as he struggled to speak. “Help… me…”



I didn’t waste a second. I pulled out my phone and dialed 911, my fingers shaking so badly it was hard to hit the right buttons. My mother’s shrill screams erupted from behind me as she lunged into the garage, her hands clawing at the air, pleading.



“Stop! \*Please!\* Just sit down—just have lunch with me!” she wailed, her voice high-pitched and frantic. Her face was twisted in desperation, tears streaming down her cheeks. But I didn’t listen. I couldn’t. I backed up, keeping a wide berth between her and my dad, and relayed the horror I was seeing to the dispatcher.



“It’s my dad… he’s lost his leg. He’s barely conscious,” I stammered, voice cracking. “Please, you need to hurry.”



The dispatcher assured me that help was on the way, asking me to stay on the line, but my mother’s desperate cries filled the garage, creating a haunting echo. She clutched at her head, her fingers digging into her scalp as she repeated, “Please, just come back to the table. Just eat. \*You have to eat!\*”



I kept my distance, heart pounding, as I watched her spiral into a frantic haze. But she never laid a finger on me; she only circled back to the door, wailing and begging in a chilling frenzy that made my blood run cold.



The police arrived within minutes, their lights flashing against the house, and rushed into the garage to assess the situation. My mother resisted, screaming and flailing as they restrained her, her pleas becoming incoherent sobs as they led her away. I could barely breathe as I watched them take her, her voice a haunting wail that echoed down the driveway, begging me to come back and join her at the table.



Paramedics rushed in and began working on my dad, quickly stabilizing him and loading him onto a stretcher. I followed them outside, numb with shock, barely able to process the scene that had unfolded. In the frigid December air, my mind reeled, looping over her chilling words and the horrible sight in that garage.



That Christmas, the warmth of family and familiarity had turned into something I could barely comprehend, twisted into a nightmare I would never forget.



I stayed by my father’s side every day at the hospital, watching over him as he slowly regained strength. On good days, when the painkillers were working and his mind was clearer, he told me everything he could remember about the last month with my mother. She’d been making strange, elaborate meals every single night since Thanksgiving, insisting he try each one. At first, he thought it was just a new holiday tradition, a way to honor Grandpa’s recipes, but as the dishes grew more unusual, more disturbing, he realized something was deeply wrong. She had started mumbling to herself while she cooked, almost like she was speaking to someone who wasn’t there.



Eventually, he’d stopped eating at the house altogether, sneaking out for meals at nearby diners, finding any excuse he could to avoid her food. He even admitted that on Christmas morning, when he tried to leave, she had drugged his coffee. Everything went hazy after that, and the next thing he remembered was waking up to pain and the horror of what she’d done to his leg.



We discussed the recipe book in hushed tones, both coming to the same terrible conclusion: the book had changed her. My father was hesitant to believe anything so sinister at first, but the memories of her frantic insistence, the look in her eyes, made him certain. Somehow, in some dark, twisted way, the book had drawn her into its thrall.



By New Year’s Eve, he was discharged from the hospital. I promised him I’d stay with him as he recovered, my own guilt over the role I’d unwittingly played gnawing at me. He accepted, his eyes carrying the quiet pain of someone forever altered.



My mother, meanwhile, was undergoing evaluation in a psychiatric hospital. Since that Christmas, I hadn’t seen her. I’d gotten updates from the doctors; they said she was calm, coherent, but that her words remained disturbing. She admitted to doing what she did to my father, repeating over and over, “We need to do what we must to survive the darkest days of the year.” Her voice would drop to a whisper, a distant look in her eyes, as though the phrase were a sacred mantra. 



On New Year’s Eve, as the minutes ticked toward midnight, my father and I went out to his backyard fire pit. I carried the recipe book, feeling its familiar weight in my hands one last time. Without a word, I tossed it into the fire, watching as the flames curled around the old leather, devouring the yellowed pages. It crackled and twisted in the heat, the recipes that had plagued us dissolving into ash. My father’s hand on my shoulder was the only anchor I had as the smoke rose, dissipating into the cold night air.



But as the last ember faded, I felt a pang of something like regret. Later, as I sat alone, staring at my computer, I hovered over the file on my desktop. The digital copy, each recipe scanned and preserved in perfect, chilling detail. I knew I should delete it, erase any trace of the book that had shattered my family. And yet… I couldn’t bring myself to [do it.](https://www.reddit.com/user/LCDatkin/) I fear that it may have a hold on me.
