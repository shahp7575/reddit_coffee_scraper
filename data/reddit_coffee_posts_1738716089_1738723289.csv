I wake up early and go to bed at dusk, most days.

I had a pretty sizable career shakeup last year and have decided to take the time to be choosy and work towards something I'm passionate about in my soul, rather than my ego-- or at least something more satisfying to its hunger. In the meantime, I'm working a day job that seems to test my fortitude but pays the bills and keeps time moving quickly.

I live in a weird part of America where summer smells like honeysuckle, mud, and rain-steam pavement.

I’m a worker bee and looking for someone to talk to, really *talk to* while I let my coffee grow cold in the morning or the rare late nights I’m awake and restless and wild— when I wish I were running barefoot through the grass.

Gin, bubbles, lime, and mint.

Working on living in the present, instead of regretting the past and mourning the future. Clawing the present back into my reach, really.

I'm looking forward to exploring the verdant landscape of getting to know someone. There is something uniquely exciting about watching the space between people grow and bloom as they connect and share experiences, stories, and conversations. The earth is never the same where they once stood.

Tell me about your favorite 2 am memory. Not the rowdy, bawdy story you barely remember-- but something when the stars were bright and your friends were all in love.

I'm not averse to chats, but longer DMs or emails are lovely as well-- or even a mixture of the two peppered with media. In a more practical sense, I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking for, or if I'm even looking. To seek is to know and certainty has never been my strong suit.

If anyone traveling around Patagonia or living here wants to help with the forest fires in El Bolsón, we could really use your support.

Our most urgent need is firefighter backpack pumps, but these cost over 200,000 pesos each. We have been gathering at Mystic Fog Beer Co. in Confluencia, which has become a base for supplies and has been providing food, water, and coffee to volunteers and firefighters. Every morning, we meet there and head up in trucks to do whatever we can to stop the fire from spreading.

We are in the process of setting up a GoFundMe, but in the meantime, you can send or drop off supplies at Cervecería Bratha in the center of El Bolsón (Av. San Martín 1517, R8430 El Bolsón, Río Negro). You can also PM me for a Zelle or MercadoPago account, and I will order what’s needed.

Aside from firefighter backpack pumps, we also need gloves, eye protection, rakes, shovels, and other firefighting tools.

Anything helps!

Si alguien que está viajando por Patagonia o vive acá quiere ayudar con los incendios forestales en El Bolsón, realmente necesitamos apoyo.

Lo más urgente son mochilas de agua forestal, pero cuestan más de 200.000 pesos cada una. Nos estamos reuniendo en Mystic Fog Beer Co. en Confluencia, que se ha convertido en nuestra base de suministros y está proporcionando comida, agua y café a los voluntarios y bomberos. Todas las mañanas salimos de ahí en camionetas para hacer lo que podamos para frenar el fuego.

Estamos armando un GoFundMe, pero mientras tanto, pueden enviar o dejar donaciones en Cervecería Bratha, en el centro de El Bolsón (Av. San Martín 1517, R8430 El Bolsón, Río Negro). También pueden mandarme un mensaje privado para coordinar donaciones por Zelle o MercadoPago, y me encargaré de comprar lo que haga falta.

Además de las mochilas de agua forestal, también necesitamos guantes, protección ocular, rastrillos, palas y otras herramientas para combatir el fuego.

I posted my daily diet on a workout sub, and the main food groups include;

\- Fresh fruits and vegetables

\- Low fat, high protein dairy (Greek yogurt, skim milk, cottage cheese)

\- Lean meats and proteins (chicken, salmon, tuna, eggs, almonds, beans)

\- Whole grains (oats, quinoa, whole wheat bread)

The biggest thing I seem to get criticized for is that apparently eating fresh fruit is ""high sugar"" and I should apparently be eating more high protein saturated fat foods (red meat, higher fat dairy, etc.) To me, ""high sugar"" is eating sweets, candy, adding sugar to your coffee or tea, eating highly processed sugary foods and drinks like soda and juice, etc. and not fresh fruit where the sugars break down more naturally in your body atop of provide additional benefits in the form of vitamins, minerals and fiber.

Furthermore, it sounds to me like people are chomping down on fatty dairy and red meats daily, and I just can't imagine that will be good for your health in the long run (and sounds very keto-ish, which two friends of mine who are very good dieticians have sworn up and down is not good for you.)

This is the Combo 3: 1 whole chicken, yellow rice, avocado salad and French fries. $28.00 out the door.

Circled back to La Polleria (they kinda looked sad and bored in there 😆) to grab something. This was goooood. I wasn’t really all that hungry but I tried everything. That chicken is fkn great. Very flavorful and tender. I look forward to destroying it. The rice was so nice and fluffy, too. And, there was no need for more salt. It was perfectly seasoned!

1ihzppp,https://www.reddit.com/r/MayConfessionAko/comments/1ihzppp/mca_one_final_relapse_wtowards_you_before_finally/,MCA. One final relapse wtowards you before finally moving on.,"This is a story about my first long relationship that didnt end quite well. Some parts arent exactly accurate anymore as its been years since this happened but ill just add a few things here and there to make the story flow.

If you guys have read my other story about my colleage turned FWB due to helping her carry a wilkins bottle, well the girl in this story ung dahilan kung bakit I was scared to enter another official relationship.

Lets name her Janna (not her real name). 
We had a roller coaster relationship. The highs were extremly high and the lows were fucking low. And the whole relationship tho it lasted a little over 4 years was fast paced.

We met at work. Nagka inuman one day. I liked her and I guess she liked me too dahil nung nag laro ng spin the bottle, after ng multiple kissing dares na nakuha namin, she became my girlfriend. 

Now here's the thing, malandi ako and malandi siya. We've had numerous partners before naging kami. Deliks diba? So ofcourse pinag usapan namin lahat. We promised each other na mag titino na kami because we felt like this relationship was it. Alam nyo yun? Ung feeling nyo kayo na ung tatanda together. 


And so the roller coaster ride began. 

Year one. 

We rented our own semi furnished condo. I still had my old honda city na pinamana sakin ng uncle ko. We worked on getting it to great running condition and also hmit wasnt all that bad aesthetically. Hindi lang talaga modern looking. Everything we did this year was for our future. 


Year two. 

Nagka kabit yung mom nya ng owner ng multiple small businesses. Her dad is only home on Sundays dahil sa type of work. 
She started out na galit na galit sa mom niya and sa kabit until they started giving her gifts. Like a lot of gifts. 

They weren't well off. Pero ung kabit nung mom niya had a lot of money to burn. She started getting watches, sneakers and shopping sprees. Then they would go on these staycations every now and then. 

You might ask why I wasnt in the picture. It was because even tho I was alright with her parents. For some reason, her mom decided to tell the kabit that Janna doesnt have a bf. And na she is curently working so she could save up for school kasi she is a college undergrad (2 years which is true). 

Her intention was for her kabit to fund Janna's studies. Well it worked. Pinag aral ulit siya. There were numerous catches tho. Hindi muna siya pwede mag bf and need niya bumalik sa bahay ng parents niya. 

Ayaw namin mag break so gumawa nalang si Janna ng secondary facebook account where in dun siya friends with her moms kabit.

By now, alam niyo na siguro where this is going.


Years three and four.

I worked while she studied. Sinusundo ko siya after class whenever I can. Madalas sila may inuman. Rarely ako sumasama because I have work. So pag ganun sinusundo and hinahatid ko nalang siya pauwi pag sinabi niyang theyre done. Minsan pati friends niya hinahatid pa namin. 

I forgot to mention na sa years na to. She cheated multiple times. Mapa with schoolmates, previous colleagues, her previous TL.

I didnt wanna leave. Lagi ko tinata ggap ung sorry and naniniwala sa it wont happen agains niya. I was so far invested in the relationship and it was my first one that actually lasted. Kaya sobra g nang hihinayang ako. 

One day tho, I just woke up and felt numb towards everything. Including her. Nung sinundo ko siya, I told her that I was breaking up with her and told her why. 

I wasnt expecting anything much. Pero I never expected that she would just be absolutely okay with it. Atleast naconfirm kong wala na talaga. 

After that day. I blocked her. 

Then came the usual broken guy arc. I started jogging again. Everyday without fail. I learned to count calories. Focused on my job. Flirted my way through tinder. 

Then for some unknown reason, I unblocked her one night. Pero that was all that I did. 

Days went by until this one night while I was jogging alang UP, biglang may nag message sakin. It was her. 

I got excited. Tumigil ako saglit and nakipag kamustahan. Told her that I would jog back home muna which I did. 

When I got back home, nag usap ulit kami. It felt different. Parang ganito kami nung 1st year palang ng relationship namin. 

We continued chatting till she suggested that we meet up for coffee to catch up. I agreed to it and told her na mag sshower na muna ako. She then said na siya din daw. 

While I was showering, biglang my phone started ringing. It was Janna and it was a video call. Nilagay ko ung phone ko sa usual spot niya whenever I watch youtube while I shower then answered the call. 

There she was naked in the shower too, waving at me. So ako naman tuwang tuwa. Told her na ang lakas ng trip niya. Pero I wasnt gonna complain haha. I watched her showering while I did too, we werent really talking. Pangiti ngiti lang and a bit of landian. 

I excitedly drove over to where I was gonna pick her up.

You guys know the saying ""distance makes the heart go fonder?""
Well for only that night it was true in our case. She was a gorgeous as ever. 

When she got in the car, we said our hellos and she gave me a little kiss on the lips. We then went to starbucks and nag kwentuhan for an hour until we decided to take the conversation over to Mariposa hotel in Anonas. 

I knew what I was doing. But fuck it. I was horny. 

Right after the moment that I locked the door, hinatak ko agad siya towards me and started kissing her. We kissed as passionately as we did back when we were still inlove with each other. 

I didnt care if today didnt have those emotions. I didnt care if tonight was just all about lust. I just wanted her so badly that night. 

We started walking over towards the bed and I started taking off my clothes. Pero before I could take my pants off, she stopped me and asked me to sit on the bed. 

She then knelt infront of me and started unbuckling my belt and proceded to pull my pants a quarter of the way down. I was rock hard and she could see it through my underwear. I was wearing boxers. She then smiled and started lightly kissing my dick through it. 

After she had her fun with the kisses, she slid her hands through the gap of my boxers and pulled my dick out. She smiled at me and said ""na miss ko to"". She started lightly playing with the tip of my dick with her finger which was now trickling with my pre cum. 

I was just watching her. I couldnt get a single word out but in my head I was practically begging her to please start sucking it coz I just couldnt take the teasing anymore.

Now as if she heard my toughts, she gave the tip of my dick a lick, smearing all my pre cum on her tongue. Looked at me straight in the eyes and started to suck me off. 

Ive been blown hundreds of time by then but that time was special. The way her mouth wrapped around my dick as she sucked it felt nothing like what ive ever experienced. I held her head and guided her pace. Id push it towards me whenever I wanted her to choke on my full length. 

That went on for minutes. Pero I didnt want to cum just yet so I stopped her and told her to get on the bed. 

There she was, completely naked once again infront of me. She had a bit of hair above her clit, just the way I liked it. 

But I couldnt pounce on her just yet. I wanted to enjoy the moment. I  started kissing her feet. Her legs. Her thighs. Her hips. The skin around her belly button. Up the center of her breasts. Then her neck as I slowly positioned myself on top of her. 

Then there we were, I was on top of her, our faces inches away from each other. We were looking at each others eyes when I managed to whisper out three familiar words. ""I love you"". 

I didnt expect her to say the words back. I didnt even know why I said it. But to my relief, she said the same words back. 

I responded by kissing her as if the last few years never happened. 
I went down on her. Ive memorized the way she wanted her pussy to be eaten. I licked the lips,mand her clit. I sucked on it every now and then. I glided my tongue up and down as if I was a hungry kid licking his dinner plate. 

I knew she loved getting fingered with my fingers slightly angled towards the left while I licked her clit. So thats what I did. I kept the pace until her body arched up and her knees locked trapping my head between her thighs as her body shuddered. 

Once she recovered I positioned myself back on top of her. I slid effortlessly in as her vagina was drenched with both her juices and my saliva. 

I pumped while we kissed. Slow, but hard. Then faster and harder. As I started fucking her hard and fast, I rested my forehead on hers. She hugged me as tight as she could and started moaning. ""Sige pa, faster, pleaaaase!"". And so I did. We fucked missinonary until I came for the first time. I let it all out just below her belly button. 

After wiping it off, I felt for my dick and was happy to know I could go a other round. 

We did it sideways. Doggystyle. Back to missionary. Doggy again while on the hotel couch. 

This time around tho when I was about to cum again, she told me that I could do it inside since she was on the pill. 

But nah, I couldnt risk it. I pulled out as I came. Wiped then hugged her as we both tried to catch our breath. 

After we showered, we started chatting again.

Thats when she told me that she was still together with the guy who came after me. I didnt know why I forgot to ask about that. Maybe i just didnt want to know. But its too late. Ako naman ung nasa other side ng stick ngaun, ako ung naging kabit. 

Im no saint. Im as guilty as she is. Im sure that at the back of my head I knew na sila parin. But I guess I wanted to be selfish that night. 

It didnt sit right with me tho. Call it post nut clarity if you want.

She told me all about the problems that they had and how shes now unsure of him. 

I let her rant. I just kept on listening and saying the right responses. 

However, as we talked and laughed together that night. I knew deep inside that this was goodbye. 

Checkout time came. We got into my truck. It was now a ranger. (Pamana parin yun just to be clear.) And hinatid ko siya to where I picked her up. 

We smilled at each other and said bye as she was getting out.

With one leg out the door she said ""chat ka pag nakauwi ka na"". 

I replied ""sorry I dont think so"".

Her smile faded. She said ""I understand. Ma mmiss kita."" And started to cry.

I started crying too. 

I held her with one arm and gave her a kiss one last time while whispering sorry. 

She just nodded her head. Wiped of her tears and got out. 

I drove halfway home in tears. The other half with a little smile due to relief. 

I knew that that was the last relaspe from her that I was ever gonna have.",1,1738722694.0,MayConfessionAko,1,1.0,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I showed my mom an outfit on Shine that I’m planning to buy for the first day of Eid celebrations. Unexpectedly, she liked it! 😂 (My mom and I always have very different styles.) She usually doesn’t like what I wear because I prefer comfortable clothes over stylish ones, whereas she is the opposite.

Then, I started learning English and completed all my tasks—unlike the past few days.

Finally, I went up to the roof with my sister. Suddenly, it started raining while we were talking about many things. I loved this moment! 💘

I’m a 40 year old male in ga and girlfriend is 39. She has 2 kids and I have one. No kids were there during this incident. Tuesday, December 17 of last year I received a message from my girlfriend at 4:03 PM while I was at work saying I am having a pretty mental health day. I know this would lead to a bad situation based on our times before so after work, I planned on finishing up Christmas shopping. I wanted to call her to be sure we got everything but I didn’t call because kids were there and didn’t want them to hear us talking about it plus her having a bad mental health situation. I was just going to talk once I got back home upon returning home she asked why did I not respond to her message and I stated what message I then noticed on the way back home. She sent a message saying I’ll leave you alone, but can you please tell me what have I done wrong? I told her who said you did anything wrong wrong what is wrong with you just tell me she stated I told you I’m having a bad mental health day and you should have came home and checked on me first. 

I told her that the kids were here so I know you would be OK until I got back and I will see what’s wrong. The conversation got heated, so I laid down to sleep. She got up, went into the kitchen, came back into 
The room and got into the bed with a bottle of pills and sat there Crying. I asked what are you doing with those and why are you crying? She said it doesn’t matter anyway I got up and went to sleep in the kids room because if I’m asking what’s wrong then tell me instead of that. I woke up about 630 next morning, expecting her to be at work already, but she was still there and we didn’t speak and I made my coffee and went to my car to smoke a cigar she left for work sometime after 7:25 AM which she usually leaves around 4:30 am. Wednesday same morning I got message saying I love you and always will. I’m sorry I messed your life up. I should have ran a long time ago. I replied stop messaging me with the BS. You want to do negativity then you can I won’t. I just paid the mortgage. Why not let me use the money to get my own place you sit around and take for me knowing you should have ran is selfish and leave me the  alone at 10:56 AM. She sends message saying she is quitting her job and I asked what does that have to do with me. She said never mind. I finish my day up at work and head home. Even though I had more Xmas shopping to do but I learned from day before. I got home around 5:30 PM and she is on the couch. Things are scattered around in the garage and kitchen. I asked what happened why is she laying on the couch learning words and in fetal position, she said, she kept falling coming in and knocked over things and that the paramedics were called by her mother because her daughter called her grandma bc she  was concerned with her, not being able to fully walk and falling down. She said she refused help and they left. 

I asked why you quit your job and she said her boss was being mean because she couldn’t work she couldn’t walk so she laid down in the back room all day and kept falling. I asked did you take those pills to try and kill yourself she said yes I wasn’t supposed to wake up. I was pissed but I still didn’t believe she took a whole bottle when she drove to work and back that day. I said come on get into bed. I’ll help her get up and she kept falling to her knees, staggering over and over and collapsed again in front of the bed. A total of 3 times before we made it to the room. 

I helped her get undressed and put her in bed as I went to the kitchen. I begin to pick up items off the stove top that were scattered from her earlier. I noticed a letter and I read it was a suicide note written to me her daughter and son also her brother and sister-in-law number stating not to release medical records to them. while reading it I hear her stumbling around in the room, trying to make her way back up the hall I help her come to the kitchen. I asked her about the letter and I said I was gonna call your brother and see what he wants me to do. She said give me the letter and She then charged me going for the letter. I had it in one hand and keeping her from getting it. She begins to hit me with both hands and chest body and face. I’m holding her with one hand by bathrobe. She keeps falling down because she is weak from pills when she is down, she kicks me in my legs, punching me in my private area and yelling. I’m gonna call the cops. I told her she says I don’t care. She bites me multiple times on hand and arm police took photos the day I got taken to jail. I’m shoving her away and I finally let the letter go and she grabs it and tries to walk down the hall and falls again while on the floor she starts to rip the letter up so I don’t have proof to show police or her brother or what she is trying to do again again I try and help her get off the floor and she says it’s leave me alone she gets up and say I’m leaving grab keys and purse goes to car. I tell her don’t drive. I cut off car saying stop and come in. She doesn’t want to she lost her phone in the house so that’s why she didn’t pull off. she was only wearing a robe bra and underwear. 

I told her if something happens to you I couldn’t live with that on my heart. We walk back in and still fall before we get to the room we laid down together. I wake up for work Thursday morning and she is in bed at 6:30 AM with food smeared in bed so she got up while I was asleep but couldn’t eat properly because of all the pills so apparently she got up in the middle of the night to eat. her daughter walks in and checks on her. She comes over about 6:00 AM on days when she’s with her dad to catch the bus. She didn’t even know what day it was and was supposed to be working but was three hours late she called her boss and said I took a pill and I couldn’t wake up on time. Her daughter and I made some jokes about food being in bed. Her daughter leaves for school and I ask her. What else should I get from the store for groceries after work which is a Thursday and I always buy groceries on those days and ask about the gifts for Christmas, we talk a little bit, but she is still out of it better than days before but she is still feeling it. I asked her why she wanted to kill herself and she said life and why did not take the pills from her. I didn’t because she needs them so I won’t just take them and dump them and at that moment I wouldn’t think she would take all those to harm herself. 

I asked do you want me to take away every sharp thing out the house and dump all the pills you would be mad at me about that why kill yourself here and risk kids finding your body or me before I left I said if you want to kill yourself then go ahead because I can’t stop it. I go to work in a few hours later. I’ll send a message to check on her and no response. I’ll call eight times. No answer. I couldn’t leave work because of blackout time. I assume she is still upset. I get home about 5:30 and she was worried. I called again no answer so I went into the trash to get the note she ripped with her brother‘s number and call him to ask for help and what should I do within minutes police pull up and arrest me sheriff and police. The arrest warrant was read to me at the sheriffs office and it stated I grabbed her by her ankles, pulling her and caused her to scrape knees, which wasn’t true days leading up to this she was crashing into her knees because she couldn’t stand and walk times before she would just collapse because of pots, which she had said it caused her to pass out and have seizures when standing up too fast or increased heart rate, she has woken up with bruises and scratches on her from fighting herself in her sleep or scratching heart certain meds she takes causes bruising for some reason and she doesn’t even know why I did notice some marks around her neck area that could have been caused by me holding her robe by the neck area during their attack, and if I caused those then I accept those she has a history of mental health issues being admitted to the hospital before she met me since being together, she has tried to harm herself from cutting her wrist and maybe taking pills I wasn’t sure but I believe she did. I was scared to get help because she is scared her ex will take the kids and because he has money and close with the police. She is worried that will happen. She has been emotionally unstable and violent from throwing and breaking things to self harm, threatening me and Herself.

I spend the night in jail. Paid 2000 to get out. We have stay away in place. Had bond review Jan 15th and judge and DA believes it should stay in place. She admitted I did none of those in the police report and she was so doped up she doesn’t know why but she was scared I was gonna call police, tell 17 year old daughter and her brother. So she tried to get me. We have talked since and been around each other even though we shouldn’t. But I do love her and I know she loves me and the kids love one another. She tried to go get charges dropped the same day actually but it’s not up to her. At the review she told the judge the truth and all he said “sounds like it’s all your fault and not his which it isn’t. The worst I did was not come home Tuesday after work to check on her but I had my reason. 

I don’t have the funds for a lawyer and I still pay bills at our home but I’m not allowed there. If I go to trial I know they will throw the book at me. First offense, no criminal record. Even she went to DA office again but they don’t want to hear it. Arraignment isn’t until April and it’s killing us not being together and the kids. Then who knows when trial will start. I do not want to cop out to anything I didn’t do and she doesn’t either but we want to be together. 

I just need advice on what to do and just any help as needed. The only photos they have was extremely bruised knees and that’s because she was falling at work, and at home. And one scratch on neck which is on police report. Please help me!! ",1,1738722103.0,legal,0,1.0,False
1ihzi35,https://www.reddit.com/r/vcu/comments/1ihzi35/prospective_vcu_art_students_please_for_the_love/,"Prospective VCU Art students. Please for the love of god, DON’T go to VCUart.","I’ll keep it brief. If you’re someone who enjoys art, and wants to go to vcuart cause you’ve heard it’s this great art school, don’t bother. For that matter, don’t go to any art school. Because when you come out of the 4 years, you’ll be left with an art degree that’s basically useless other than it being a BFA. You have student loan. You don’t know who will hire you. Art doesn’t pay. 

Here’s an option I would suggest you seriously consider: 

Take take a gap year or time to really think through what it is you wanna spend 4 years of your life, time and energy, and get into student debt for. Ideally you would wanna think of a career that pays decent, you get to work from home, so that you have flexible work life balance and financial independence. Something like computer science perhaps. 

For learning art, learn from New Masters Academy and Schoolism. Those two will teach you anything you could possibly wanna learn. Drawing box.com is also great. This way you’ll have a career that is non-art but that you don’t hate and gives good pay and flexible life, so you can use free time on enjoying art and learning. It gives you freedom and no stress about starving artist. 

Don’t feed the education system where so many 18 year olds get tricked into making a big life decision for nothing with loan and time. If you’re really committed in improving your skill, you’ll succeed on your own with those two resources. That’s just my piece of advice, as someone who’s gone through it all at VCUart. Do what you want, but don’t rush into something that is not a reality. 

P. S.
Read lots of self help books like Meditation by Marcus arelius, Breaking the Habbit of being yourself, power of now, daring greatly. And podcast like rich roll podcast or JP podcast.

Also, take it or leave it, but if you do take it, thank me in your heart after 2028. Basically, put some coffee money or whatever you can afford on buying XRP crypto. This will give you financial independence. It’s $2.5 now, but I believe it’ll go to $1k in 2026 and $10k in 2028. That’s just what I believe. Do your own research. ",0,1738722053.0,vcu,6,0.27,False

I first noticed she liked me because whenever I walked into the cafeteria, she would find a reason to be near my station. Over time, we developed non-verbal signals—just spotting each other from a distance to acknowledge that we had noticed each other.

Every interaction between us was subtle and discreet to avoid drawing attention from her coworkers. One day, I finally gathered the courage to ask her out for coffee. She said she would love to but was usually busy during the week, so I suggested Friday, and she agreed. She even gave me her number.

That evening, I tried calling her, but it turned out to be the wrong number. I thought maybe I had misheard it, so I tried different combinations, but none worked. Two days later, I walked in to grab a cup coffee. She was working at another section, but as soon as she saw me, she came over. I told her I had trouble reaching her. She repeated her number, and it turned out I had captured it correctly. It was just the wrong number. She seemed unsure of her own number. Since one of her coworkers was starting to notice, I quickly asked her to take my number instead and call me. That’s when we realized she had given me one wrong digit.

The next evening, I texted her to confirm if we were still meeting on Friday. She replied that she had caught a bad flu and was unlikely to make it. I wished her a speedy recovery and told her to take care. The following afternoon, I called to check on her. She sounded really sick, but we ended up having a great 25-minute conversation in my opinion. I asked about what she was taking for the flu and suggested a few remedies to help her recover faster. We also talked about our city and places outside the city where I could take her on weekends. The call ended on a good note.

The next morning, Sunday, around 11 AM, I texted her to ask how she had slept and how she was feeling. I also mentioned that I didn’t want to call in case she was resting. She replied almost immediately, saying she was feeling better, but her response felt a bit dry. I offered to send her Uber Eats so she wouldn’t have to cook, but she declined, saying she had already made pasta. After that, she completely ghosted me. Every attempt to reach her was ignored.

Two months later, I called her again on a Friday evening. Surprisingly, she answered on my second attempt. I was friendly and mentioned that I had tried reaching her several times. She responded by reminding me that she had told me she was always busy. She sounded annoyed that it was me. There was noise in the background, making me think she was at a restaurant. I asked her directly if she was interested in a relationship. She said we could talk about it another day, but she seemed irritated.

A month later, I tried calling and texting again, but I was ignored. Probably even blocked. After that, I stepped back completely. It has been months, and I have never reached out again. But now, whenever I walk into the cafeteria, she looks like she really dislikes me. To this day, I still don’t know what caused the sudden change in her attitude.",2,1738721902.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

He is certain that I made a huge error/was an asshole in our relationship and that I can't come back from this. I believe I may be the asshole as I didn't even consider it as a mistake at all. 

Background - My partner has issues in the past with cheating - it's been huge in his family and in his past relationships. I have not cheated on him in our relationship. I am friends with my ex of three years and I really enjoy that friendship and get a lot of career support from it - my mom is dead and the rest of my family live on the other side of the world so I may value friendships more than other. I am also unemployed right now and my ex is in the same industry. 

My boyfriend was anxious about this relationship as it was an ex and asked for reassurance. I gave it to him. I went to meet my ex for a coffee. My partner was very anxious about this - he was worried about how I would feel about my ex. He asked me for reassurance after coffee. I met my ex, it was great to chat career directions. He said would I like to come in and pick up some of my old books. I said yes, got the books. I immediately called my partner to reassure him that I love him and it further clarified he was my partner seeing my ex/being friends with my ex.

Later I was talking to my partner about my day and mentioned getting the books. He believed that this was a huge violation, and that nobody other than me would have gone into their ex's house without checking with their partner first. It never occurred to me to do that.

Hoping to hear from people close to our age. I’m 33(f), my fiancé is 30(m), we’ve been together about 7 years and recently decided to get married.

It came up in conversation with my friend that I don’t know how much money my fiancé makes. When I asked him, he gave me a ballpark range, and was reluctant to tell me. The other day I overheard him on a call with a recruiter, and learned that he makes almost 3x as much as I do. He contributes about that much more than me in rent. Everything else is separate. We buy our own groceries and take turns buying things like toilet paper and soap. We rarely have dinner together or go on dates, but when we do we split the bill. If he picks up coffee creamer or something for me he sends me a Venmo request. 

The other day, my coworker said she’s trying to teach her son that he can’t take a girl on a date unless he has money to pay for it. I told her they could go on a free date, and she said she’s trying to teach him that it’s his responsibility to pay for things like that. I told her my fiancé and I have always split the cost of dates, just like everything else, and she gave me a pitiful look, gave me a hug, and said “I’m sorry.” That’s not the first interaction I’ve had like that with a coworker or friend, and it feels super awkward.

A girl in my derby league said “you split costs? What, does he have a magical d**k or something?” Little comments like this have me wondering if most couples our age don’t split costs. I really haven’t thought that much of it up until recently, noticing how other people think it’s so weird and we’re planning to get married. 

My fiancé is pretty sure that my coworkers have an outdated way of thinking because most of them are our parents age, and couples our age split everything. He wants to keep it this way after getting married, unless maybe we have kids and I take time off work. 

I’d love to get opinions, if my friends and coworkers way of thinking is outdated, if the way we do it sounds normal or unhealthy.

TL;DR My fiancé and I pretty much keep our finances separate, and my coworkers and friends have hinted that they feel sorry for me because of it. My fiancé thinks their way of thinking is outdated, and it’s normal for couples in our generation to split everything equally, even when they’re married. Is this true?

**$390 - PTS Masada ACR SV DE AEG -** [https://imgur.com/a/6j61CgS](https://imgur.com/a/6j61CgS) \- **Will cover the cost of shipping**

* Various upgrades have been done to it. Purchased back in 2015.
* Spring has been downgraded to M100 spring, and clocked at 346 FPS back when indoor requirements were capped at 360 FPS.
* Wii-Tech steel inner barrel, and Modify Flat Hop bucking are installed
* ~~Wii-Tech Hop up Adjustor Kit and~~ Bearing Spring Guide is not installed but included in the package
* 2x midcap PMAGs included (One full markings and one no markings)

* One pack of Element MOE polymer rails in DE for the above picatinny accessories
* Original A2 birdcage flash hider included, just not pictured
* Simple AR carbine soft gun bag included, original box not included

There are a few issues with this model that's expected for a decade old rifle. They are:

* Missing c-clip/retaining clip for handguard pin (can be purchased from Amazon, Home Depot, Cantire)
* One of the rear metal pins to secure stock to lower receiver is missing (can be purchased from PTS Steel Shop website)
* Bolt release feature is faulty. You must manually pull the bolt a bit to release it from its locked position when adjusting hopup.
* One of the midcap mags have mag feeding issue due to weak spring. You can remedy this by replacing the decade old worn out spring with a new one.

Regarding the metal body pin. I can manually measure using a caliper so you can find a similar one from your local store or home hardware center. Same with the retaining clip. Most or majority of parts can still be purchased directly from PTS at a low cost: [https://pts-steelshop.com/collections/airsoft-replacement-parts-masada-aeg](https://pts-steelshop.com/collections/airsoft-replacement-parts-masada-aeg)

**$400** **- Cyma Platinum MP5 AEG (CM041H) - Asia Model -** [https://imgur.com/a/CO2dBr6](https://imgur.com/a/CO2dBr6) \- **Will cover the cost of shipping**

* Purchased back in 2021, has been used in a few games, wired to Deans
* FPS is capped at 370 FPS, perfect for indoor and outdoor games
* eShooter Kestrel V2 Bluetooth programmable mosfet installed, since the stock mosfet died after a year of use. Kestrel has been tuned by Dave from Airsoft Depot
* 4x additional plastic mags included + 1x original mag that came in the box
* Clone MS2 OD sling and RSA sling adapter included
* One metal M-lok rail adapter included
* The MP5 has a QD latched flash hider with a hidden 14mm CCW threaded barrel beneath it for tracer units or mock suppressors
* Original box and manual included

This rifle has been used in both indoor and outdoor games and has been well taken care of. It's a very snappy and responsive SMG with an impressive 50m effective range with 0.32g BBs. As with all programmable mosfets regardless of whether it's Kestrel, Gate, or Perun, please note it drains batteries fairly quickly. Around 450\~500 rounds in, you will have to plug in a new battery. Tested with HRG 11.1v 1100mAh LiPo.

Additionally, for some reason selector on full auto doesn't seem to register. Either the selector plate is misaligned or the Kestrel isn't intended for an MP5 shell. Regardless, I don't think this is a major issue since majority of fields enforce semi only anyway. You can program the SMG to shoot burst, binary, or full auto on the semi option if needed. I will also include the original packaging for the Kestrel upon selling.

Shooting video will be provided upon request.

Why do I feel guilty?,"I’m struggling because I left a relationship that was incredibly toxic. I have always been transparent with him about my mental health and am in therapy. I was dealing with undiagnosed ocd and insomnia/panic attacks at night and he eventually got more more frustrated with me saying it’s always something or I wanted to feel special. I started therapy to try to learn to better communicate and honestly to find out if I was totally wrong because I felt I was going crazy. Early on if I was having a hard day and asked for space he got frustrated and then I felt I had to ask for forgiveness when I was at my breaking point begging him for space. One night I woke up and my heart was racing I tried to take deep breaths to try to go back to sleep, he rolled over and said “yeah let’s get real mad” so I left the room to try to sleep on the couch and didn’t say anything. As we got ready in the morning he asked why i was mad at him and I explained I was having a panic attack trying to calm myself down and what he said was rude and felt that he was treating me bad (I agree this wasn’t the best way to communicate how that made me feel) and he put a hole in the wall. Initially we took a month break where we still saw each other on the weekends and talked as we were trying to make things work. I went back because I missed him and felt it was my fault. The arguing started again and once I got my ocd diagnosis he said I didn’t have proof on paper. The final straw was I went out for drinks one night with friends and offered to bring him food home, came home excited to see him and he gave me dirty looks saying his girlfriend came home at 2am (we live 35 minutes from the city). He said I need to learn how to call it quits and sacrifice and come home to him because every night together isn’t special, what’s special is the sacrifice. In the morning I tried to make pancakes and coffee for us as he angry typed on his phone. He said I could’ve done everything right this morning but it wouldn’t matter. He said he doesn’t care about words of affirmation and that love languages don’t mean anything but his love language is real which was me coming home at 12:30 or 1 to be with him. He then yelled at me for wanting to stay at my parents for my mom’s a birthday so I wouldn’t have to drive late on a work night. He got made saying he didn’t like the back and forth and I explained i wasn’t leaving I was just spending the night for her birthday and he said he wants to be with someone who wants to come home with him every night. Mind you, I haven’t spent a night apart since the beginning of the relationship unless he was away for a work trip or at his parents. He correlated my inability to stop overthinking to my inability to submit to his undisclosed curfews. He would get mad even if I was just out running errands with my sister and didn’t know exactly when I’d be done. I feel guilt for leaving and I question if I was wrong. I know I’m not proud of how I handled things at times. He said “I am not controlling you, you think I’m controlling you because you have a chip on your shoulder” and I asked how so and he said “you have the problem” Was this abuse?",1,1738720996.0,emotionalabuse,0,1.0,False

Essential Tips for Traveling While Pregnant: What You Need to Know
------------------------------------------------------------------

Traveling while pregnant can be a wonderful experience, but it does require some extra planning. Expectant mothers may have unique needs and concerns that could shape the travel experience. Whether you're heading to a sunny beach, exploring new cities, or visiting family, here are essential tips to help you travel safely and comfortably during your pregnancy.

### Consult Your Doctor

Before making any travel plans, talk to your doctor. They can provide personalized advice based on your health and pregnancy stage. Make sure to ask about:

- Your travel destination and its safety for pregnant travelers
- Any vaccinations or medications you might need
- Traveling restrictions based on your pregnancy week

### Choose Your Destination Wisely

Selecting a pregnancy-friendly destination can significantly enhance your travel experience. Consider the following places known to be relaxing and accommodating for pregnant travelers:

- **Beach Resorts:** Locations like Hawaii or the Caribbean offer beautiful beaches and a chance to relax.
- **Calm Countryside:** Visiting rural areas with scenic views can provide a peaceful retreat.
- **Accessible Cities:** Cities like Vancouver or Barcelona have excellent healthcare services and plenty of amenities for expectant mothers.

### Plan Your Transportation

Your choice of transportation can greatly impact your comfort. Here are some tips:

- **Air Travel:** Most airlines allow expectant mothers to fly up to 36 weeks. However, check the airline's policy on pregnant travelers and consider booking direct flights to minimize layovers.
- **Car Travel:** If you’re driving, plan frequent stops to stretch and take breaks. This can help with circulation and reduce fatigue.
- **Train Travel:** Train journeys often offer more space to move around, making long trips more comfortable.

### Pack Smart

When you're packing for your trip, be sure to include items that will keep you comfortable:

- **Comfortable Clothing:** Choose loose-fitting, breathable clothes. Easy-to-wear shoes will help if you're doing a lot of walking.
- **Pregnancy Pillow:** If you're staying away for a few nights, consider bringing a pregnancy pillow to get good rest.
- **Medications:** Pack all your prescribed medications, as well as a small first-aid kit.

### Stay Hydrated and Nourished

Proper hydration and nutrition are crucial during pregnancy. Keep these tips in mind:

- **Drink Plenty of Water:** Carry a reusable water bottle to ensure you stay hydrated throughout your journey.
- **Healthy Snacks:** Stock up on nutritious snacks like nuts, fruits, and whole grains. This will help you maintain energy levels and manage nausea.

### Listen to Your Body

Your comfort is key while traveling. Be attentive to how you're feeling and don’t hesitate to take breaks. If you experience any discomfort, it’s okay to adjust your plans. Some tips for listening to your body include:

- Rest whenever you feel tired.
- Avoid overpacking your itinerary; plan light activities.
- Utilize relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation when stress arises.

### Understand Medical Facilities

Research medical facilities available at your destination just in case you need assistance. Know where nearby hospitals or clinics are located, and how to access them. Make sure that your insurance covers care in the area, especially if you are traveling abroad.

### Travel Insurance

Consider purchasing travel insurance that covers pregnancy-related issues. This can provide peace of mind and assistance in case of unexpected events or cancellations.

Traveling while pregnant can be enjoyable and fulfilling with the right preparations. Embrace this special time and create lasting memories. Make sure to prioritize your health and comfort, and you are sure to have a wonderful experience.

### Conclusion

Traveling while pregnant can be a rewarding experience, offering unique opportunities to create lasting memories before your little one arrives. With the right planning and precautions, you can explore some of the best places to travel pregnant. From serene beach getaways to distinct cultural cities, the top 10 destinations highlighted provide a range of experiences that prioritize your comfort and safety during this special time.

Regular breaks and gentle activities can keep you energized and relaxed.

Ultimately, the goal is to enjoy this fleeting moment of anticipation before welcoming your new family member. Regardless of where you choose to go, the memories you create will enrich your pregnancy journey. With careful preparation and a spirit of adventure, your travels can provide joy and relaxation.

1ihyzmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1ihyzmy/my_husbands_trump_obsession_has_turned_our_home/,My husband's Trump obsession has turned our home into a MAGA shrine and I'm losing my mind,"From r/stories

I never thought I'd be posting here, but I desperately need to vent. My husband of 12 years has transformed from a reasonable conservative into what I can only describe as a Trump cult member, and it's destroying our marriage.

Our house has become a literal shrine to Trump. I wish I was exaggerating. There's a 6-foot Trump cardboard cutout in our living room that he talks to every morning like some sort of religious ritual. Our walls, once decorated with family photos, are now plastered with Trump flags. He even replaced our American flag with a ""Trump 2024 or Death"" banner. My kids are embarrassed to have friends over.

Last week was the final straw. He spent $3,000 of our savings on ""limited edition"" Trump gold-plated coins and a ""certified authentic"" piece of Mar-a-Lago toilet paper. THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. When I confronted him about taking money from our children's college fund, he said ""Trump University will be reopened and make education great again."" I couldn't make this shit up if I tried.

Every dinner conversation somehow turns into a Trump sermon. He'll randomly shout ""STOP THE STEAL"" during family meals. When our 15-year-old daughter got an A+ on her history project about the Civil War, he accused her teacher of being a ""communist infiltrator"" for not teaching ""the truth about Trump's victory.""

Our bedroom... God, I'm mortified to even type this. He insists on keeping a giant Trump portrait above our bed because ""Trump watches over us."" He even got a Trump tattoo on his chest and keeps trying to convince me to get one too. He calls it his ""Mark of Patriotism.""

His entire personality has been consumed. He changed his wardrobe to only red clothing. He refers to himself as a ""Digital Soldier"" and spends hours posting on Truth Social. When I asked him to help with our son's homework, he said he was too busy ""fighting the deep state online.""

The paranoia is getting worse. He installed cameras around our house to ""watch for Antifa."" He thinks our neighbors are ""deep state agents"" because they have a pride flag. He threw out our coffee maker because ""Starbucks is funding the radical left."" He even accused our golden retriever of being ""suspiciously woke"" because she didn't bark at a Biden commercial.

Our sex life? He insists on playing Trump rally speeches in the background and keeps trying to get me to wear a Melania mask. I wish I was joking. He has different MAGA hats for different occasions - including one specifically for ""bedroom patriot time."" I'm dying inside.

I found receipts showing he's donated over $15,000 to various Trump-related causes this year alone. Money we needed for our mortgage. When I showed him our overdue bills, he said ""Trump will fix the economy and make us rich."" We're facing foreclosure, but he keeps buying Trump merchandise.

Yesterday, he announced he's legally changing his name to ""Donald J. Trump Smith"" and wants our kids to follow suit. Our 10-year-old son started crying, and my husband told him ""real patriots don't cry"" and made him watch four hours of rally footage as ""testosterone training.""

I've tried everything - marriage counseling (he called the therapist a socialist), family interventions (he disowned his own mother for suggesting he get help), even pleading with his Trump-supporting friends to tell him he's going too far. Nothing works. He just goes deeper into the rabbit hole.

The worst part? Under all this Trump worship, I know my real husband is still in there somewhere. Sometimes, late at night, I catch glimpses of the man I married. But then morning comes, he puts on his MAGA hat, salutes the Trump cutout, and the cycle begins again.

Edit: Please stop DMing me about joining your ""Trump Wives Support Group."" I appreciate the thought, but I'm not interested in your MLM scheme selling Trump-themed essential oils.

Edit 2: Yes, I've already hidden our important documents and started a secret savings account. And no, I won't sell you his ""rare"" Trump toilet paper, even if you're offering Bitcoin.

Edit 3: To the people saying ""this can't be real"" - I wish I was creative enough to make this up. Come visit for dinner sometime. Hope you like hamberders while watching Tucker Carlson reruns on loop.",1,1738720572.0,copypasta,1,0.67,False

hope all is well.

So, the wife (Filipino) and I (UK) are moving to Riyadh for my job which will be at King Khalid Airport. We have lived in Oman, Bahrain and Qatar among other countries with a total of around 10 years in the middle east (15 total as an expat) so have some good knowledge of the middle east but, have never even been to Saudi before and thought it was worth asking some questions:

1. I understand that compound living for expats *used* to be the thing to do but, maybe it isn't now? I like the idea of this as I think (could be wrong!) that the wife will have a litte more freedom to dress casualy on a compound when inside where as outside there are obviously requirements for much more modesty. I also belive that compounds used to have a good social life. Is this still the case or, can my wife meet other wives outside of compounds and build a good social life, in particular, with other Filipino?
2. As mentioned, I will be at the airport so, given the above, can you recommend any areas for me to look at, please? Our budget, for the two of us for accomodation, will be between 10 and 15k a month and will need at least 2 bedrooms, access to gym, pool and maybe a coffee shop on premises. I'm almost certain a compound will cover everything we need but, maybe an apartment block may also? Certainly did when we lived in Qatar!
3. My big concern, and I've managed to get lucky on this in the past and not be caught out, is rental **contract minimum terms**. For example, I usually turn up on a fixed term contract but, this is rarely the fixed term it says. It might say 1 year and end up being 18 months or, maybe they will say 3 years and, for whatever reason, end up being 1 year (it's not uncommon for companies to be fired, i'm sure you all have heard of it!) and I'm concerned about being locked in to a contract without an income. Are there rental contracts that can be taken on a quarterly or even monthly basis? What about any diplomatic clause, are they a thing in Saudi rental contracts?

A random collection of thoughts,"The days are weird and the nights are long.   No one at work is talking about what is going on and no one has mentioned a word since the inauguration.  Not even the mention of tariffs.   It's honestly jarring.  The normality of my work day.  I wake up and look at my window and the street is still the same street.  The same cars warm up in the morning, the flash of their lights breaking through the early morning darkness.  I start the coffee pot, get the littles breakfast ready and wait for the baby sitter to take over before heading to my office.  

My parents will call wanting to see their grandchildren. We will briefly talk of the weather, the errands that need run, the projects the house needs done.  

Only after my husband comes home and we are alone do we talk of it.  What do we need to do next. How do we protect ourselves and our children when things get bad.  And then we talk of the mundane. The bills that need paid.  What the house needs done.  

It's a weird balance.  I haven't cried in three days.  I'm not sure if I'm becoming numb to it all or just off balance.  

The thought I can't seem to get out of mind right now is do I still even bother filing my taxes right now with wannabe Hitler hijacking our treasury?  Is anyone even trying to file their taxes right now?  


Lastly, my husband and I agreed my parents go on an information diet.  We cannot trust them as they have made their views abundantly clear.  They still fully support Cheeto baby.  Today hearing them excuse off a nazi salute as not a nazi salute was the final nail in the coffin for my husband.   It's odd how a few months ago I was getting advice on how to gray rock my husband and now he and I must do this to my parents.

I guess out of all this chaos the one thing I can say is that I have my husband back.  It's not perfect. We still have moments that we struggle to work through, but it's like hes been shaken awake. 

That's it for tonight. I have a million more thoughts in my head swirling around but I want to spend the rest of my evening holding my children.  Thank God they are too small to realize what is going on right now.  There is a small mercy in that.  

Until next time. 

Actually one more thought, can we stop trying to pick a fight with Canada already?  How stupid are my countrymen that they want to fight a country that wrote the book on how to get away with committing war crimes and still have people love you?

hope all is well.

So, the wife (Filipino) and I (UK) are moving to Riyadh for my job which will be at King Khalid Airport.   We have lived in Oman, Bahrain and Qatar among other countries with a total of around 10 years in the middle east (15 total as an expat) so have some good knowledge of the middle east but, have never even been to Saudi before and thought it was worth asking some questions:

1. I understand that compound living for expats *used* to be the thing to do but, maybe it isn't now? I like the idea of this as I think (could be wrong!) that the wife will have a litte more freedom to dress casualy on a compound when inside where as outside there are obviously requirements for much more modesty.  I also belive that compounds used to have a good social life.  Is this still the case or, can my wife meet other wives outside of compounds and build a good social life, in particular, with other Filipino?
2. As mentioned, I will be at the airport so,  given the above, can you recommend any areas for me to look at, please? Our budget, for the two of us for accomodation, will be between 10 and 15k a month and will need at least 2 bedrooms, access to gym, pool and maybe a coffee shop on premises.   I'm almost certain a compound will cover everything we need but, maybe an apartment block may also?  Certainly did when we lived in Qatar!
3. My big concern, and I've managed to get lucky on this in the past and not be caught out, is rental **contract minimum terms**.  For example, I usually turn up on a fixed term contract but, this is rarely the fixed term it says.  It might say 1 year and end up being 18 months or, maybe they will say 3 years and, for whatever reason, end up being 1 year (it's not uncommon for companies to be fired, i'm sure you all have heard of it!) and I'm concerned about being locked in to a contract without an income.  Are there rental contracts that can be taken on a quarterly or even monthly basis?  What about any diplomatic clause, are they a thing in Saudi rental contracts?

If you saw this sale like I did and want to jump on it, I advise you to stay CLEAR AWAY. I had just purchased one yesterday, set it up, updated drivers/Bios. This morning I’m doing work on it (I do audio editing work), I went to make a cup of coffee, when I came back to my PC it was in sleep mode. I woke it up and continued to work, 15 seconds later the computer restarts out of nowhere. I ended up losing about an hour of work because of this.

Tried trouble shooting for hours, after nothing worked, I decided to bring it back to BestBuy. The Geek Squad there said it could possibly be a CPU issue and not a PSU issue like I thought because the CPU remained on while power cycling after getting out of sleep. They said the BestBuy 15 mins away had one in stock if I wanted to exchange, I decided to bite the bullet and try because what are the chances that a new PC will have the same issue.

Well I was wrong, because it did lol. The SAME EXACT issue out of the box, PC would reset about 10-15 seconds after being woken up from Sleep mode. 

After checking BestBuy reviews, I noticed that other people were complaining about the same issue.

SO BUYER BEWARE, it may look like a good deal but you’re rolling the dice on getting one that actually works. Lesson learned, READ REVIEWS and do not buy CyberPowerPC pre-builds.

Caffeine pills, being concentrated caffeine, can be beneficial but dangerous. Although you know how much caffeine you are ingesting (in the case that the company has performed stringent testing) with caffeine pills, it's tempting to take one too many until you're used to them and regret it soon after.

1ihyjt0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ihyjt0,The First Tea That Really Got My Attention,"You could say that this was the one that started it all. 

I came across this Gyokuro Genmai after giving up coffee and exploring my local Asian Market for replacements. This would be the first of many teas which I would purchase there and serves as my guide into the vast world of Camellia sinensis. I came home, brewed a cup and found myself tumbling head over heels as I transitioned from one brew to another. 

Here are my tasting notes for this particular Gyokuro Genmaicha. 

Dry Aroma: Grassy yet floral with notes of nori and zucchini, strong matcha latte vibe.

Wet Aroma: Toasted rice and edamame. Very cozy. 

First Infusion: Very light green soup with great clarity. An herbaceous bright sip that wraps around your tongue and finishes with puffed rice nostalgia as it fades away a grassy vegetal note brings you home to your next sip. 

Second Infusion: A light jade soup, mostly clear with a bit of haze. A deeper vegetal sip, toasty but with a zucchini like finish and rather delicate nuances. Just a touch of astringency at the end. Reminds me of late spring. 

Third Infusion: A vibrant yellow chartreuse soup. All rice on the nose. Wilted greens up front and toasted grains in the back. Pumpkin notes are all that remain. 

I would definitely recommend this Gyokuro Genmai, it made it very easy for me to leave coffee behind and has encouraged me to continue pursuing the wide variety of tea which is available. I have enjoyed every second of this transition including and especially the incorporation of Gong fu style into the brewing process. 

Gyokuro is a shade grown Japanese green tea. “The name ""gyokuro"" translates to ""jewel dew"" or “jade dew.”[…] While most sencha is from the Yabukita (薮北) cultivar of Camellia sinensis, gyokuro is often made from a specialized variety such as Asahi, Okumidori, Yamakai, and Saemidori. Most gyokuro is grown in the Fukuoka, Kyoto, and Mie prefectures[…] The shading causes both the amino acid L-theanine and the alkaloid caffeine in the tea leaves to increase, and the catechins and tannins to decrease, which yields significant differences from the flavor of sencha[…] Gyokuro also has higher chlorophyll content, which accounts for the dark green color of the leaves. These chemical differences lead to unique flavor and aroma of the tea, giving it more umami, a savory sweetness, and less bitterness and astringency.”

**[Check Full Pricing Here](https://5starchoices.com/?p=5182)**  

**Quick Rundown**  
Here’s what you need to know about the top frothers:  

- **Dreo Milk Frother**  
  The luxury pick. Works with all milks—dairy, oat, almond. Creates café-quality foam every time. 8 settings let you choose foam density. Stops automatically so milk never burns. Built like a tank.  

- **Secura Milk Frother (Basic)**  
  Budget-friendly starter. Makes decent foam with regular milk. Struggles with plant-based options. Heats fast but lacks advanced features. Good for occasional use.  

- **ATSENT 4-in-1 Frother**  
  The workhorse. Handles big batches and heats milk in seconds. Non-stick interior wipes clean easily. Makes cold foam just as well as hot. Best for families or frequent use.  

**[Check Full Pricing Here](https://5starchoices.com/?p=5182)**  

- **BIZEWO Touch Screen Frother**  
  Looks sleek with touch controls. Foam quality is good, but some units stop working after months. Better for light use. The spout helps with latte art if you’re feeling fancy.  

- **Secura Silent Frother**  
  Whisper-quiet. Makes basic foam without waking roommates. Temperature control isn’t exact, but it’s reliable for simple lattes.  

**What Matters Most**  
- **Milk type**: Plant-based? Go Dreo or ATSENT. Dairy? Any model works.  
- **Noise level**: Secura Silent lives up to its name.  
- **Durability**: Dreo and ATSENT outlast others.  

**Pro Tips**  
- Always pour milk below max lines to prevent spills.  
- Cold foam works best with high-protein milks like skim or soy.  
- Clean immediately after use—dried milk gums up whisks.  

**[Check Full Pricing Here](https://5starchoices.com/?p=5182)**  

**Final Take**

Like - I literally brought it home last night. I have gone through almost an entire bag of beans trying to make this thing brew a cup of coffee to almost no avail.

Making the grind coarser did help but still produced only a few sad drips of espresso. I had to repeat this a few times to get enough to drink. It did taste fine.

The milk frother also barely worked and petered out before the milk was fully frothed.

I think it must be an issue with how the water is being pulled in since it's affecting both the espresso function and the milk frother. I tried fully removing the filter from the tank to see if that was causing some of the issue and it made no difference.

Instead, reach out in empathy. If they're directly affected, tell them you're there for them, that you care for them, that you hope they are doing okay in these terrible times.

When I was raised I normalized toxic behavior from my parents. They were both Catholic but basically ""swore off God."" They would have traits similar to regular parents but it was actually twisted on the inside. 
 
My first thing is that my mom was deep in substance abuse. In fact I was her drug sitter once when I was about 7 or 8, saying ""if mommy passes out call 911"" (so she was dozing on something). My dad would enable this behavior by buying her drugs and coffee brandy, maines favorite alcohol. 
 
It really didn't stop there. My family drove her almost completely insane and I had no way of keeping in touch with her, they scapegoated her as the source of problems... that they helped cosponsor.

This trend would continue but my dad set his focus on me because as time would reveal, he was a pedophile,  he would dig in my underage sister's clothes hamper to sniff their ___. 
 
When I first found out he didn't know I saw his shadow glaze under my doorway into her room.  He did often when he thought I was distracted and he was the only one home.
 
I was scared to say anything.  They conditioned or hypnotized me or something so that I was scared to express myself. I was experiencing gender dysphoria as well and if this is a gross detail I apologize but obviously I was wearing my stepsisters clothes and i had the suspicion this is what he wanted somehow. 
 
I don't have any evidence for it but I think they were trying to make me passive + Trans to put me on the street or something. Like subliminally trying to get me to act and think a certain way and then framing me. 
 
Hold on because now I add a plot twist that sounds wild but I gotta say this. 
 
Before my dad divorced my mom, he did this with my half sister. Apparently this was my family secret, that he got caught, maybe blackmailed. But it was likely set up through my mom with my sister.
 
On the surface most of my life my half sister seemed caring and a bit goofy but as time wore on I noticed something strange about her emotions and her tone in sentences (I think I have undiagnosed autism, I pick up on tones). 
 
Which: my parents didn't take either of us to see counselors, they assumed everything was fine... because they controlled context and people by bribing them or isolating them. 
 
My half sister seems like she's actually working with my dad. I suspect they are actually trying to kill me and suspect that they're trying to get insurance money or clout or something. 

When I went homeless at 28, she ""helped"" me buy a new car but in reality she was aiding and abetting me into tax fraud. On top of this she somehow found me on YouTube on a video she could not have possibly found without hacking my phone and was under an established, fake identity.

 She actually was catfishing me into a relationship VERY carefully and without going into detail the setup was perfected, like horrifyingly perfected, in that I didn't suspect who she was. I am FAIRLY certain she was trying to make me into a S.O as part of this sacrifice by killing me without pulling the trigger but had to use things that removed all suspicion. 
 
This action continued until October 2023 when there was a mass shooting in Lewiston, maine. The shooter was reported to of had mental issues and said voices were calling him a pedophile. 
 
Lemme say that again: voices were calling him a pedo
 
Which resulted in him apparently going on a rampage and killed 17 people. I have a YouTube video about how my story is actually involved called Robert Card Mass Shooting Insurance Theory on youtube. My father was an insurance agent who can still sell insurance and even told me personally that one of the big victims (Ron Morin) was someone he djed for. He had no remorse or empathy on his passing by the way. 
 
If you connect those dots though... 
 
Isn't that just a strange mirror coincidence. 
 
And yes, the modus operandi and theory had me put in a suggestion to the fbi. 
 
Currently I'm homeless, I have been for 7 years. I survived by telling my story in hip hop under call Me Dogma, and RedSept. There's this hope that I am wrong because of my mental illness that my family refused to get treated, but there's this quiet thought that these are extremely dangerous people who want me to appear as the dangerous one because they're scared these truths will leak out. 
 
And to me, I feel it deep down. Thank you for reading.

1ihyasd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ihyasd,"Shrek and Skibidi: A Conversation About Life, Identity, and the Absurdity of Existence","The only reason why we have a lot

The only reason I’m asking you to go is to see the house in a few minutes before I go home to do my hair so try and make sure that you’re ready to go and I can go hendhsjnsvsbjs x Imagine for a moment that you’re sitting in an ordinary café, enjoying a cup of coffee, when suddenly, out of nowhere, Shrek appears beside you. No, this isn't a dream or some bizarre alternate reality—Shrek, the lovable, grumpy ogre from the swamp, is sitting across from you, curious, intense eyes locking onto yours. Before you have time to fully process the situation, he asks you, “So, what’s your life all about?”

Before you can even answer, a loud “Skibidi dop dop dop dop yes yes!” bursts through the air, and out of nowhere, a wild, unexplainable dance starts happening around you. It's as if the very fabric of reality has been twisted, and now you're stuck in a scene straight out of a viral internet meme. The ""Skibidi"" dance, with its absurd choreography and nonsensical energy, envelops the moment. Shrek looks at you, a smirk on his face, and says, “Alright, I’ll let you figure that one out. But seriously, what’s your life really about?”

Now, it’s easy to think that a conversation between Shrek and Skibidi would be nothing more than pure chaos—a collision of an ogre’s emotional depth and the internet’s greatest absurdity. But, in many ways, this bizarre, imagined meeting offers us a chance to explore a deep question: What is life really about? Is it a search for meaning like Shrek’s personal journey, or is it more about embracing the absurdity and randomness of existence, like the unrestrained energy of Skibidi?

This essay takes a journey through these two contrasting yet complementary perspectives—Shrek’s quest for self-acceptance and the seemingly nonsensical, chaotic world of Skibidi—and how they might inform our understanding of our own lives.

Shrek’s Quest for Meaning: Identity, Authenticity, and Self-Acceptance
Shrek, the green ogre with layers both literal and metaphorical, offers a compelling view of the search for meaning and purpose in life. His character arc in the 2001 animated film Shrek is all about rejecting societal expectations and finding self-worth through authentic relationships. At the beginning of the film, Shrek is isolated, living alone in his swamp, a place where he feels safe from the judgments of the outside world. His sense of identity is shaped by the rejection he has experienced—he believes that he is nothing more than a frightening, grotesque creature who is doomed to live alone. However, as the story unfolds, Shrek is forced to confront his own self-imposed isolation and the role that identity plays in how he interacts with the world around him.

Shrek's journey is one of self-discovery. Through his interactions with Donkey, Fiona, and others, he learns that his true worth is not defined by how others perceive him but by his actions and the love he can offer. The narrative suggests that identity is not something fixed, but something that can be shaped by one’s choices and relationships. In this way, Shrek exemplifies a deeply human struggle: the quest for authenticity in a world full of expectations and judgments. He teaches us that the key to a meaningful life is not to conform to the labels others assign to us, but to embrace our true selves, no matter how flawed or misunderstood we may feel.

So, when Shrek asks, “What’s your life about?” it’s a question that invites introspection. Like Shrek, we are often searching for our place in the world, attempting to reconcile the person we are with the expectations placed upon us. Life, for Shrek, is about embracing one’s true nature and the love and connections that come with it—acceptance, even if it means rejecting the norms that society insists upon.

Skibidi: Embracing Life’s Absurdity
Now, imagine the scene shifts abruptly, and the chaos of Skibidi envelops you. Skibidi is an internet meme that emerged out of a fusion of odd, spontaneous dance moves, and catchy, repetitive music that has taken over social media platforms. It’s viral, energetic, and thoroughly nonsensical. The meme has no inherent message other than pure entertainment; its purpose seems to be rooted in randomness and the celebration of absurdity. Characters performing the Skibidi dance often wear bizarre, exaggerated expressions and perform over-the-top movements—there’s no clear reason behind it, no philosophical undercurrent. It's simply fun, energetic, and bizarre.

In many ways, Skibidi’s existence embodies a counterpoint to Shrek’s journey of identity and meaning. While Shrek asks about the deeper significance of life, Skibidi dances around the question, refusing to take anything seriously. There’s an element of freedom in the Skibidi meme—a liberation from the need for structure, depth, or even logical coherence. It’s the perfect embodiment of absurdism, embracing the chaotic, random aspects of existence with no apology. In the same way that Shrek represents the search for self-acceptance in a complex world, Skibidi represents the embrace of life’s inherent absurdity.

The Skibidi dance, in all its wild, unrestrained joy, offers us a reminder that sometimes, life doesn’t need to make sense. Sometimes, the point isn’t to find profound meaning but to simply enjoy the moment, to laugh, to dance, and to revel in the randomness of it all. In a world that often feels confusing and chaotic, Skibidi suggests that we should find joy in the absurd, acknowledging that life’s unpredictability doesn’t always need to be understood—it can simply be experienced.

The Tension Between Meaning and Absurdity
What makes the meeting between Shrek and Skibidi so fascinating is how these two characters, each embodying different aspects of human experience, interact and challenge one another. Shrek represents the deep human desire to find meaning, identity, and connection. His life’s journey is about rejecting the labels imposed on him by society and finding a sense of belonging through love and acceptance. Skibidi, on the other hand, encourages us to embrace the absurd, to let go of the need for structure, and to simply enjoy the unpredictable nature of life.

In some ways, Shrek’s character asks, “What is the purpose of my existence?” while Skibidi responds with a spirited, “Why does it matter? Just dance!” This interplay between seeking depth and embracing absurdity reflects a central tension in life. We often find ourselves searching for purpose, meaning, and connection, much like Shrek. But at other times, life’s absurdity demands that we stop overthinking and simply experience the chaos, finding humor and joy in the random moments that arise.

The question Shrek asks—“What’s your life about?”—is both deeply personal and philosophical. It’s a question that invites us to reflect on our own journey for authenticity, love, and connection. However, Skibidi reminds us that there is no single answer to this question. Sometimes, the answer might be to embrace the chaos, to laugh at the unpredictability of existence, and to accept that life doesn’t always have to make sense to be enjoyed.

Conclusion: Finding Balance Between Meaning and Absurdity
In the end, the meeting between Shrek and Skibidi reflects the complex nature of human existence. Life is both a search for meaning and a celebration of absurdity. We are constantly balancing the need to find purpose with the acceptance that not everything needs to be understood. Shrek’s journey teaches us the importance of identity, self-acceptance, and love, while Skibidi encourages us to embrace the randomness of life with joy and laughter.

So, when Shrek asks, “What’s your life about?” maybe the answer is that it’s both—about finding meaning and embracing the absurd. In the end, perhaps life is best lived by accepting both its depth and its chaos, knowing that sometimes, the greatest meaning comes from simply dancing with the absurdity.

1ihyai1,https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/1ihyai1/from_fear_of_death_to_back_on_the_road/,From fear of death to back on the road...,"I text my friend last night around 7:30, ""How's it going?"" ""Just got back. Long day."" ""Can you get me off this boat in the morning? I've been out of water all day."" ""Wanna go now? I'm gonna be in a hurry in the morning."" ""Yeah."" ""K."" My gear is packed. I'm gonna take this chance to hit shore, find a spot to camp, and bail in the morning. Gear on deck. Trash on deck. Make sure I've got towels where I have a few leaks. Make sure my charge controller is set to turn my anchor light on at sunset and off at sunrise. Make sure it's covered and can't get wet.

Nothing. It's a five minute ride from his boat to mine. An hour goes by. I shoot another text, ""What's up?"" Nothing. A half hour later I call. Get sent to voicemail. A text, ""I'll call you back."" 'He's probably dealing with family stuff.' 

Another hour goes by. I send another text, ""I hate to bug you but..."" Nothing. Twenty minutes later, ""Everything alright over there?"" Nothing. Fourty five minutes later, ""What's going on?"" Nothing.

Eventually I decide 'Fuck this. I'm grabbing my gear and going back inside. At least I'll be comfortable.' I'm soaked from dew. My gear is soaked. I go down below and setup my bed. Get comfy. Kick a movie on. I'm thinking it's pretty rude of him not to have the courtesy to text me and let me know what what's up, much less call me back like he said he would. I've been staring at his boat for a few hours now. Nothing seems amiss. He's blown me off before, but there's always a text explaining what's going on. In the back of my mind I hope nothing really bad has happened to him. But he's a big boy. He's ex-navy. There's people he can call because he's from here. I hate to say it, but I'm grinding on it a bit. 

There's nothing like telling someone in the morning you're out of water, having no way to shore, having been told they'll come get you this evening, making contact, being offered a ride, and then getting blown off, to put you in a bad frame of mind. I'm dehydrated. Not in great shape.

I scroll reddit to break my mind off things, but dehydration and the very real fear that you might not make it back to shore is not mentally a place you want to be. It's real hard to ignore that when you're in survival mode. I eventually fall asleep.

I'm awake with the sun. I repack my gear just in case he shows up unannounced. Wait until I know he's up and had coffee. Text, ""I really hope you can get me off this boat this morning."" Nothing. I can see he saw my text. I give him half an hour. 'Maybe he's getting ready.' Another text, our usual greeting, ""Hey."" He sees that one too. Nothing. 'Why the fuck isn't he answering?' Another half hour. Another text, ""I don't understand what I did to make you ignore me."" He sees it. Still nothing. 'This is getting out of line."" Another half hour. Text, ""I can see you reading these messages. Talk to me man."" He sees it. Nothing. 'Alright. I've done nothing wrong. I always help him when he needs it. I thought we were friends. WTF!!! This is pissing me off now. Am I gonna have to start breaking out flares and waving for help to get off this boat?' 

I'm dehydrated as fuck at this point. I'm getting mad as hell. I definitely don't deserve this kind of disrespect. At least text me and tell me to go fuck myself. But no communication? You're playing little kid games with my life at this point. I do not appreciate it. At all. 

The reason we help everyone out here, wether we like them or not is because people can die out here. It just doesn't happen any other way. You always help. Always. No matter what it takes, or what it costs you. And you only leave when you're sure this other person's in good shape, and you know they're gonna stay that way.

You don't offer help and then go complete silence on someone. Especially when that person has been good to you. I've done a lot for him that would have cost him thousands of dollars. For nothing. Because he is my friend. I've given him brand new anchor ropes for storms that I shouldn't have given up. I've spent days wiring in his electrical system... You get the picture. He's helped me a lot too. It's always been mutually beneficial in the end.

Another text, ""One ride to the dock. I'll never ask you for help again."" Nothing. He doesn't even look at it. 'That's a whole other level. Fuck me?! Dude.' I wait a while. 'I *know* I've done nothing wrong. Why is he treating me like this? We were good just last night. And when we went to go look for my dinghy. Yesterday morning. I've covered propane for a bunch more rides than he's given me. We used my tank to go look for the dink. (Professional boater's term for dinghy.) I don't understand. Fuck it. Once this fog clears I'll start firing off flares every time a boat goes by and try to catch a ride to the dock. I have to hit shore today. This is getting dire.'

Final text, ""I'll pay you to get me off this boat."" I don't have much money. Maybe $20. At this point he can have it if he'll get me off this boat. I'm desperate. Whatever it takes. I have to get some water. And I'm supposed to be on my way to dude's house for work today.

I go up on deck to see if he's gonna head for shore. It's near the time he's been leaving his boat lately. 'Might as well fire up a smoke. I've got a backup plan. I need to calm myself, and proceed in an orderly fashion. One thing at a time. All is not lost yet.' 'Nothing is fucked here dude.' That makes me almost smile. Smoke lit. Sitting on the bow. 'nocs in hand...

My phone rings. 'Please be him... It is!' ""Hello?"" "" Hey man. I've been really unable to deal with anyone for a minute. I got way too much shit going on. It's all going really wrong..."" He proceeds to give me the rundown. I know pretty much all of it. And he's right. The shit he's going through right now is some of the worst shit in life anyone can deal with. I'm not gonna elaborate because that's his business. But I don't know how he hasn't snapped and started killing people yet. For real. 

We talk. I commiserate as best I can. I really don't know what to say to most of it. He needs an ear he can trust. I'm happy to let him get it out. He's beyond miserable and barely holding it together. I'd much rather he vent than do something stupid.

He's standing in his dink the whole time we're talking. ""Let me get this motor started and I'll come get you"" ""Cool. Thanks brother."" 

He comes over. I drop my stuff in his dink. We head for the dock. Tie off. Gear out. Trash out. I throw it all away, mine and his. He just takes off walking. He's in his own world. No problem. I got shit to do myself.

Gas station. Coffee. Gallon of water. Cheap pack of smokes. Bus stop. I'm gonna take the bus up to a spot near the 95. That will put me in a good spot to hitchhike. The bus should be here in about twenty minutes. This coffee is shit, but I've got it loaded with sugar and hazelnut creamer.  It's pretty much liquid candy. And I'm happy to have it. Bus time comes and goes. No bus.

I burn some of my very limited data to see where the bus is. Forty five more minutes. A guy shows up, asks about the bus. I give him the news. 'I need a beer. You want one?' Me, 'Nah, I'm good bro. Thanks.' He leaves and comes back. We shoot the shit until the bus comes. Get on. I head to the back. Drop my gear.

And immediately realize I have to pee. Bad! It's gonna be a forty-five minute bus ride. I have to catch another bus five minutes after this one stops. I find a stop closer than where the buses meet at a gas station. Close enough I can walk to catch the second bus.

I'm dying! This is getting to be beyond an emergency. I suck it up, but I'm trying to think of how to piss on this bus somehow. My nerves being fried from thinking I was stuck on that boat isn't helping. It's bad.

Finally hit the stop at the gas station. Of course I've got to cross two sides of the intersection. Haul ass into gas station with full gear. Into bathroom. 'Sweet Jesus!!!' All good.

Back out. Down the road to bus stop on foot. Wait at the bus stop at the courthouse for forty-five minutes. Catch next bus.

Wawa for the first meal of the day. I'm starving. It's 2:00 at this point. Eat. Chill. Bathroom. Starting to feel a little like my usual self. Out to onramp. It's a good one. Plenty of room to pull over. Gear down. Thumb out.

An hour and a half goes by. I wave at several cops as they get on the interstate. They don't stop. Just the way I like it. Some smiles. A couple 'little ways' hand gestures. A few friendly honks. I'm pretty worn but I've got my best hitchhiking smile on. Everybody's smiling back at me. And then a cop stops.

I'm friendly. He's friendly. He explains about controlled access highways. I know that where I'm standing that does not apply, but I don't have the energy to get into a debate about it.

Usually I would start to leave, wait until he's gone and go back to the same spot and continue. He was really trying to be helpful. He suggests walking a couple miles to the cost where I can walk down the highway if I want to. I'm in no shape to be anything but nice. I look for a bus. It's after five. I'm not walking a couple miles at this point. Find a bus. Will be there soon.

Gear up. I walk as fast as I can to get to the bus stop a few minutes early. Gear down. Burn some more precious data to check out where I'm going. Good camp spot. No food anywhere near there. I'm gonna get hungry soon.

I decide I can catch the bus in the morning. There's a bunch of food places here I can't afford, but there's a Seven-Eleven across the street I can blow some ebt at. And a nicely treed field close by to pop my tent up in. 
Gear up. Off to field. Tent setup. Me inside. Gear inside. Daily update. 'What a day...'

My husband of 12 years has transformed from a reasonable conservative into what I can only describe as a Trump cult member, and it's destroying our marriage.

Our house has become a literal shrine to Trump. I wish I was exaggerating. There's a 6-foot Trump cardboard cutout in our living room that he talks to every morning like some sort of religious ritual. Our walls, once decorated with family photos, are now plastered with Trump flags. He even replaced our American flag with a ""Trump 2024 or Death"" banner. My kids are embarrassed to have friends over.

Last week was the final straw. He spent $3,000 of our savings on ""limited edition"" Trump gold-plated coins and a ""certified authentic"" piece of Mar-a-Lago toilet paper. THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. When I confronted him about taking money from our children's college fund, he said ""Trump University will be reopened and make education great again."" I couldn't make this shit up if I tried.

Every dinner conversation somehow turns into a Trump sermon. He'll randomly shout ""STOP THE STEAL"" during family meals. When our 15-year-old daughter got an A+ on her history project about the Civil War, he accused her teacher of being a ""communist infiltrator"" for not teaching ""the truth about Trump's victory.""

Our bedroom... God, I'm mortified to even type this. He insists on keeping a giant Trump portrait above our bed because ""Trump watches over us."" He even got a Trump tattoo on his chest and keeps trying to convince me to get one too. He calls it his ""Mark of Patriotism.""

His entire personality has been consumed. He changed his wardrobe to only red clothing. He refers to himself as a ""Digital Soldier"" and spends hours posting on Truth Social. When I asked him to help with our son's homework, he said he was too busy ""fighting the deep state online.""

The paranoia is getting worse. He installed cameras around our house to ""watch for Antifa."" He thinks our neighbors are ""deep state agents"" because they have a pride flag. He threw out our coffee maker because ""Starbucks is funding the radical left."" He even accused our golden retriever of being ""suspiciously woke"" because she didn't bark at a Biden commercial.

Our sex life? He insists on playing Trump rally speeches in the background and keeps trying to get me to wear a Melania mask. I wish I was joking. He has different MAGA hats for different occasions - including one specifically for ""bedroom patriot time."" I'm dying inside.

I found receipts showing he's donated over $15,000 to various Trump-related causes this year alone. Money we needed for our mortgage. When I showed him our overdue bills, he said ""Trump will fix the economy and make us rich."" We're facing foreclosure, but he keeps buying Trump merchandise.

Yesterday, he announced he's legally changing his name to ""Donald J. Trump Smith"" and wants our kids to follow suit. Our 10-year-old son started crying, and my husband told him ""real patriots don't cry"" and made him watch four hours of rally footage as ""testosterone training.""

I've tried everything - marriage counseling (he called the therapist a socialist), family interventions (he disowned his own mother for suggesting he get help), even pleading with his Trump-supporting friends to tell him he's going too far. Nothing works. He just goes deeper into the rabbit hole.

The worst part? Under all this Trump worship, I know my real husband is still in there somewhere. Sometimes, late at night, I catch glimpses of the man I married. But then morning comes, he puts on his MAGA hat, salutes the Trump cutout, and the cycle begins again.

Edit: Please stop DMing me about joining your ""Trump Wives Support Group."" I appreciate the thought, but I'm not interested in your MLM scheme selling Trump-themed essential oils.

Edit 2: Yes, I've already hidden our important documents and started a secret savings account. And no, I won't sell you his ""rare"" Trump toilet paper, even if you're offering Bitcoin.

Edit 3: To the people saying ""this can't be real"" - I wish I was creative enough to make this up. Come visit for dinner sometime. Hope you like hamberders while watching Tucker Carlson reruns on loop.",3,1738718262.0,copypasta,1,1.0,False
1ihy6nw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1ihy6nw/making_a_traveling_warlock/,Making a traveling warlock.,"Okay, bottom line, I've made a character mostly focused on RP and flavor, and now I need help making him useful. I have 4 specific ideas and would like you to thumb up or down each of them.

  
Set up. This is an S-tier camper and traveler. He is a genie warlock so he takes his home with him wherever he goes. He took magic initiate so he has goodberries, so he's never hungry and he will either take another MI to get elementalism or he will multiclass to get elementalism. So by level 1 or 2, he can make food, make water, flavor his food and water, and he has his genie tent. And he has a pet dragon through the chain which lets him communicate with anyone of any language.

  
He is also an aarakocra so he can travel by sky. His background is sailor so he can also travel by sea. His skills don't matter. But his tool proficiency is vehicles (water) and brewing because his genie bottle is also his distillery. He makes rum and grog and beer and gives it away for free to anyone travels with. So that's the core. Now, to make him useful in a fight, while maintaining his RP flavor. Four choices:

  
1) Multiclass into artificer alchemist. Now, on top of beer and rum, he makes potions. During 4 hours of SR in the morning he can make 8 potions for AC and boldness. He'll get a +1 shield and wand. giving him a +4 AC and an average of +3.5 to attack rolls. Leans into his brewing angle, so I like.

2) Multiclass into Druid stars. He gets to be an animal. Cool. He gets the great con, wisdom and intelligence bonus of the dragon to maintain concentration. Boss. He looks like a flying stellar dragon at night. ""A star crossed traveler in love with the night sky"" also fits real nice.

  
3) Multiclass into draconic sorcerer. Ignore all the dragon stuff. He gets to attack more often. I'm not talking coffee lock, boy needs to sleep. But with 4 hours of SR each morning he'll have like 8 rounds of extra EB. That makes him more useful in a fight. Pure mechanics makes him good in a fight. Plus this gives him false life and darkvision which he can cast before a sr and keep for 8 hours. Useful stuff.

  
4) Multiclass into noble genie paladin. All genie motif. Nothing interesting at all except I get a fk ton of AC. 2 for shield proficiency, +1 for defensive fighting, and then +3 - +5 ac bonus for Charisma. I'll have a 21? or so at level 3. 23 with the shield spell. 

  
What's important: Most important is anything that adds to the notion of ""Super duper best world traveler build"" 

Second: I like cheese. I'd go full coffeelock if it made sense, but then he loses his genie home and brewery and that's lame.  I like the AC of the paladin, the attack of the sorlock, the concentration defense of the druid and the combination of stuff alchemist gives. What's best? ",1,1738718229.0,DnD,3,1.0,False

The first is found just after we see Pips on the screen with the words “Grab a coffee at Pip’s Bar & Grill” and shows a close up of Mr Drummond’s hand tattoo that says FROLIC.

Not sure if this is because he spied on Devon and Mark there a couple of episodes ago? Or if it’s pointing to something else?

The second is after we see a shot of some houses in Keir and it says  on screen “You’ll want to stay here!”. This frame shows what looks to be the tree Gemma supposedly crashed her car into.

Again not sure if it’s just referencing the fact she is completely trapped there, or something else?

Also the whole ad makes me think it’s not only those on the severed floor Lumon are experimenting on, and whatever they are doing involves the wider residents of Keir as well.

I think i fell in love with one of my closest friends. We met at our old martial arts dojo and we’ve known each other for about 10 years now. We used to work together running the summer camps and after programs for our dojo all through middle and high school. We’ve kept in touch since going to different universities but we don’t really talk regularly. We catch up every 4 months or so by going out for coffee at the same coffee shop we always go to and we end up talking for hours about life and what’s going on since we last saw each other. I decided to go see her in the Netherlands when I had a break from school and she was studying abroad for about a year. I’ve probably been in love with her for a long time but I didn’t realize it until the last time I saw her. I know it sounds stupid but there’s just that feeling I get when it’s just us catching up on life talking and it feels like time is flying by but no one else in the room is even there. I’m unsure of how she feels and I also feel like it would be incredibly unfair if I end up opening up with these feeling before I move across the country or but on the other hand I know if I say nothing or do nothing I don’t know if I’ll be able to get out out of my mind. I also know if I end up hurting her or end up completely ruining our friendship it’ll repeat in my head.

1ihxu85,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1ihxu85/story_time/,Story time,"
Two years had passed since I met her, and I had never had a friendship like this before. She was 30, I was 31, and we seemed to orbit around each other in a way that felt too perfect to ignore. At first, I didn’t think much of it, but as the months unfolded, I began to notice how much we had in common—how we could finish each other’s sentences, how we both loved the same quiet coffee shops, the same rainy days. She made me laugh like no one else could, and for the first time in my life, I felt seen, really seen, by someone. The kind of seeing that made me feel less like a cliché and more like I mattered.

She was always there for me, not just in the big moments but in the quiet ones too, when I needed a friend the most. And I began to fall for her. Slowly at first, like a ripple spreading across calm water. Her kindness was a balm to my soul, a peace I didn’t know I needed, but had been craving for years.

For the longest time, I told myself I couldn’t fall for her. I couldn’t risk it. I’d promised myself I wouldn’t make a fool of myself again, that I wouldn’t let my heart be shattered. I had only loved once before, and it had ended in ways I couldn’t undo. But, of course, I fell. I fell because she made me feel something I hadn't in a long time: safe. She made me feel cherished, like my kindness wasn’t a weakness but something worth protecting.

By the time I gathered the courage to ask her out, Christmas Eve rolled around. The snow was falling outside, the world wrapped in a soft, white silence, and there I was, sitting on her couch, heart racing. I took a deep breath told her what I thought about her and asked her out.

Her response was… not what I expected. It wasn’t the rejection I feared, nor was it a resounding yes. It was something in between, something that left me confused but oddly hopeful. She said she swore it wasn’t about me, that I’d be “the one that got away” if she didn’t choose me, but that right now, with everything going on in her life, she wasn’t ready. She needed time to adjust. She didn’t want to lose what we had, and she assured me that nothing would change between us.

I nodded, holding her gaze, and said I understood. I promised her that no matter what, nothing would change. I wasn’t going anywhere.

In the days that followed, I thought about it. I played out different scenarios in my head, trying to figure out what it all meant. Three possibilities crossed my mind:

1. She was being honest, and maybe, just maybe, when she was ready, we’d be together.


2. She had once wanted to be with me but had found someone else in the time we’d spent as best friends, and now she was waiting to see if they would make a move.


3. She had always wanted us to be nothing more than friends, and all of those sweet words had been her way of making sure I didn’t leave because of how much she valued our friendship.



I wasn’t sure which one was true, and part of me didn’t want to know. I had to accept it, whatever it was. My heart ached, yes, but not in the way it once had. It wasn’t the kind of pain that made me want to run. It was a quiet, bittersweet understanding. I loved her more than I had ever loved anyone, and if that meant I’d never experience the kind of love she gave someone else, then I could live with it.

We still hung out every day. Nothing had changed on the surface. We still linked arms when we walked together, still shared our favorite shopping adventures, still watched the same movies late into the night. Nothing had changed—except the unspoken thing between us that I could never quite name.

And maybe that was okay.

Because I knew her. I knew that even if she fell in love with someone else, she wouldn’t let that change our bond. She wasn’t the type to let a relationship get in the way of a friendship. I’d seen it before. She’d walk away from anyone who tried to break what we had.

So, I stayed. Best friends. Even if I was the one who would always wonder what might have been.

But sometimes, in the quiet moments when I saw her smile at me, when she leaned her head against mine as we watched our favorite show, I thought maybe, just maybe, we were already living something beautiful. Something that didn’t need labels or definitions. Something that was, in its own way, perfect.

And I was okay with that.

I have recently started watching Twin Peaks for the first time, you can guess at the reason why, and I was very shocked by how DP is just Japanese Twin Peaks. Agent Francis York Morgan has the same ""weirdness"" about him and the genuine child-like love for the simple things like coffee, pie, the smell of the trees as Agent Cooper. He has the twins room like the many visions of Cooper and even the one-sided conversations (Zach - Diane). The story starts as a simple murder investigation but becomes a web of interpersonal relationships of the locals and maybe some paranormal elements start to show themselves in this quiet town. There is a Log Lady equivalent as well - Roaming Sigourney. 

Alan is not so obvious with it's references but the influence is also palpable. The diner has the same table placements as the show, Hartman's clinic feels a lot like the Great Northern hotel. It even has it's own Log Lady variant - Lady of the Light. 

There are probably a lot more pieces of media that would not exist or would be very different if it wasn't for Twin Peaks, for instance the Velvet room from Persona comes to mind or the pretty on the nose callback in Soul Eater (that one is for my fellow weebs).

Hey everyone. I hope you’re all doing well. Wanted to sort of share some recent stuff. I’ve been posting a lot in this sub (from various accts) for the past 9 months since my(36F) ex(33M) dumped me. It has been the biggest endurance test of my life, and I am someone who has survived losing multiple friends to death, lots of health issues and multiple surgeries throughout the years, and long covid. Nothing compares to the pain of this heartbreak I have been subjected to. 

Throughout 9 months I struggled with keeping No Contact. He dumped me in June 2024. Then I reached out again last September to try to see if anything was there, there wasn’t. Only more rejection. Then I tried again in December and that time we tried to be “friendly” and met up for a coffee. I tried again to get back together and same result. Then we tried a third time to be friendly last week, this time meeting at my apartment for coffee again. And that meeting ended in me crying and pleading him to come back to no surprise yet another rejection. This time in person which was even worse because stupid me thought, well if he sees me in person in a private setting maybe he’ll be physically attracted to me at the very least and maybe there was be some tension there. Nope, nothing on his end. I emailed him later that day asking if he’d be interested in at least a casual thing and he basically told me he’s not attracted to me anymore and just wants to be “platonic friends”. This is a man who repeatedly told me I was his “dream girl” throughout our 2 year, very serious relationship. This is a man who told me I was the best fuck of his life. That I was the most beautiful woman in the world. That I was perfect in every possible way, body and mind. That I had impeccable style and how much he loved showing off how beautiful I was to his friends. I felt like an absolute goddess. Now I feel like a cardboard box. It’s not even like I’ve changed in appearance. In fact I look even better now than I did in the relationship. I thought for sure he would lose his mind when he saw me…but I couldn’t be more wrong. I’ve actually never been so wrong about a person. 

I don’t really know what I’m seeking here by posting this. I already know I’ve embarassed and disrespected myself and him enough by breaking NC several times. I guess I’m just here to say that I am finally done trying. I have disrespected myself enough. For the longest time I held out hope for us getting back together. I thought surely he knows he’s making a mistake because he’s so in love with me. But the cold truth is he’s not. People change. And that’s it. The sad part is a connection like what we had is so rare and I just wish he would see that. Good luck to him and his journey. I’ve started an SSRI today and I am ready for a new life.

1ihxqud,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesForMyTherapist/comments/1ihxqud/on_the_block_universe_model_talk_about_the/,"“On the block universe model, talk about the ""present"" or ""now"" works just like talk of ""here"".","Remember last week when you said to your friend, who was late arriving for coffee, ""now you're here""; or when, long ago, Caesar said, ""I am now crossing the Rubicon""?

These claims are both true. That's because all it means to talk about the present, or now, is to talk about the place in time where you happen to be.

Since we are always located wherever we are (that's trivially true), everyone is located in the present, just as everyone is located at the place they call ""here"".

According to the block universe view, time or temporal relations of ""earlier than"" and ""later than"" exist. These relations hold regardless of where anyone is located.

So, suppose Bert the dinosaur is located earlier than Sally the dog. That relation between Bert and Sally holds, regardless of whether we are located earlier than Bert or later than Sally.

Bearing this in mind, it is possible to see how to make sense of the idea of past and future. Just as on this model ""now"" picks out whatever time I happen to be located at, ""past"" picks out any time (or events at those times) that are earlier than my location, and ""future"" picks out any times or events that are later than my location.”

This is actually in regards to a group fitness instructor. I've (F 41) been attending this class for a couple months I've known the instructor (Male 40's) longer though. I felt attraction and he seemed flirty with me and I finally took the opportunity to ask him if he wanted to get coffee sometime which maybe I shouldn't have. Anyway I'm a little bit confused with his response.

 He said he's really busy right now but maybe if his schedule opens up we can go get coffee. Which obviously sounds like a no but then he told me where he spends his time otherwise and said if I wanted to go there sometime and say hi (Like randomly pop by a public place) I could.

 At first I took that negatively because like I'm not gonna go bother him when he's out and about and if he's not interested in me enough to spend time with me and make plans why would I do that? But then I was talking to a friend who works at the same gym and she said they're super strict about employee client relationships and maybe that's a loophole. Like if we just happened to run into each other out in public he would have the option to be more receptive?

I'm so embarrassed I can't figure out if I should just stop going to his class or if I should go and just act like nothing happened and see how he is. And maybe go to his work to say hi if it feels positive? I just can't figure out if I go to see him down town does that make me look desperate?! Or was I supposed to get the hint?

I understand rejection can be hard to give but I appreciate it when people can be clear. I don't really know where to go from here. 

The last thing I wanna do is seem like a creeper. I don't understand why he would tell me where he spends his time when he's not at the gym though if he were overwhelmed or annoyed with me.

1ihxow8,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditonwiki/comments/1ihxow8/aita_for_making_my_sister_cry_after_major_surgery/,AITA for making my sister cry after major surgery,"Hi guys, love the show, me and my husband listen to you every card ride we take, which is a lot! I have never posted on Reddit before, but I think I have the feel for how things work on here from listening to your show enough. My husband told me my story would be perfect for your show, so here it goes, sorry, it's a long story, but it involves poop, fedoras, and boobs, so how can you go wrong:

AITA for making my sister cry after major surgery:

I (44 female) and the rest of my mom's side of the family got diagnosed with being carriers of a genetic mutation called BRCA 1. This mutation is called this because it is very likely you will get breast cancer if you have the gene.(BReast CAncer) Long story short, my uncle got diagnosed with a different cancer during covid, but was a strong indicator for the gene mutation, so he told the whole family we should get tested. So in the middle of the covid shut down, almost my entire mom's side of the family got the test and came back positive for the mutation. It's a crappy thing to find out, but it's also good to find out early, because there are a lot of preventative procedures, especially as a woman, that can be done to prevent cancer. 

My sister, (46 female) was diagnosed positive as well. She has better insurance than I do, and started getting ready for some surgeries first out of the rest of the family. The main procedure most women get is some sort of double mastectomy as a preventative to getting cancer. A very common one, which most of my family got done is called a FLAP procedure, where you get a double mastectomy, but then they replace your breasts tissue with another part of your body, usually the stomach. It's an intense surgery, and there's a lot that goes into it. 

We live in Montana (neighbors to Canada!), and my sister found a place to have this procedure done across the country in New Orleans. She needed someone to go with her to help her recover from the surgery for a few days and then fly home with her. Her husband couldn't get the time off work, and they have 2 kids that he needed to stay home with, so I volunteered, because not only could I physically help her out, but I wanted to meet the people at the clinic and have a consult for myself to have the same procedure done as well. My sister went down a few days early to do sight seeing and get situated, her insurance told her they would cover travel and hotel for both of us, so i fronted the bill in hopes of getting paid back. She picked a hotel close to the surgery center, and I flew in the day of her surgery. I actually got in while she was in the middle of surgery. Here is where things started to go wrong. 

I get to the hotel that she chose for us, and it is not nice. I am not a fancy person, and expect a luxury staying situation, but this place was far from even a holiday inn. I get in the room, and there are 2 beds, a tv, a very tiny fridge, and a bathroom. The bathroom is right next to the bed, the room is tiny, and there is no fan in the bathroom. As some people know who have surgery, pooping after surgery is a big deal. You get super backed up, and it can be a whole ordeal to get your bowels moving again, and to not have the slightest bit of privacy, or a fan to cover he smell or sounds, it could get awkward. But we're family, so whatever. Also, at one point in the trip, I had to catch a giant lizard in the bathroom because they kept getting into our room.

I walk to the hospital because it is only a few blocks away, chat with my sister, she is doing good after surgery, and will be ready to go home the next morning. Things start out fine, and the nurses start giving me instructions of how to care for my sister for the next few days until we can go home. I leave, and come back the next morning. 

My sister is up and ready to go, but keeps insisting that she wants to walk back to the hotel since it is only 2 blocks. You are supposed to start walking as soon as possible after the surgery.. but down a hallway, not down the streets of new orleans. I keep telling her that isn't going to happen, and I am getting an uber and she gets upset at me. Finally the nurse comes in and my sister exclaims, ""I can just walk to the hotel, I'll be fine!"" and the nurse is having none of it and tells her no, thank god. so we get an uber, go back to the hotel, go on some short walks, things are chill, I have to change some tubes, it's pretty gross, but we make it through the first day.. but my sister hasn't pooped yet. 

I have had a lot of surgeries, so I find myself to be a pro at getting my body to poop after surgery. One great trick is to drink some magnesium citrate.. but at this time, there is a shortage across the world because of some sort of contamination, so I go to the store and buy all the things to get my sister to poop. I come back, and let her know what I have, tell her she needs to start drinking water, and take some meds and we can go for a walk. And she is having none of it. She says, ""let's just walk to the front desk and get coffee, that always helps me go to the bathroom."" I try to explain that coffee can help you poop, but it is also a Diuretic, and can make you dehydrated and that she needs to drink a lot of fluids. Nope. not happening. we go get coffee. She continues to only drink coffee for the rest of the day. i tell her she should really be drinking water, and based on her weight, she should be drinking x amount of glasses of water a day. She looks at me like I am crazy and says, ""that's impossible, no one can do that, and besides, coffee is a liquid.""

I decide to choose my battles, and let her run the show for a bit. She decides she wants to eat some cajun food for dinner, because she wants to try it while in new orleans, I am thinking how that is going to mess her stomach up so bad, but she seems really sensitive, and I just decide to let her do her thing. We order the food via door dash, she eats, drinks more coffee, and pretty soon starts telling me she is having intense pain in her stomach. As a reasonable person, I know that it is because she needs to poop and she is also probably full of gas after all that food she ate, but she insists it's her surgery. We start getting ready to go to the hospital, but I convince her to drink some ginger ale before we go, and all of a sudden she let's out the largest longest burp imaginable, and then says ""oh, I feel tons better now!"" Face palm, face palm face palm! yeah no shit. She continues to burp loudly all night long. 

The next few days things just get worse, i finally went and bought some prune juice, heated it up and told her to chug it and boy did it do the trick, finally she poops! I leave the room for her to do her thing, because, again, bathroom right next to the bed, no freaking fan! She starts to feel better. things get a little less intense, until it's time to go home. 

We start packing, and I ask if she wants me to help pack her carry on, and she is grumpy as all hell and is also a controlling person in nature, so she snaps at me to let her do it herself. I might add at this point that she bought a ton of sovereigns for her family, and asked me to bring an extra suitcase for her, which I had to pay for out of pocket as well. She starts shoving things in her carry on like a taxidermied mini alligator, voodoo dolls, some sort of wizard's cane thing, and stuff isn't fitting in this suitcase. She also has a ton of surgical stuff she is bringing back with her, so she finally stuffs everything in her bags, except for 2 fedora hats she got, one for her husband, and one for her son, and she decides she's just going to wear them both... at the same time.. through the airport. Nothing weird about that, okay sure? 

Right before we are about to head out the door, my sister has a meltdown. She gets frustrated and starts literally stomping her feet on the ground like a two year old. I ask what is wrong, and she tells me that she can feel the holes from her compression socks on the bottom of her feet, and it's uncomfortable. She is starting to lose control. I tell her to take a deep breath, we will get through it, I know it's tough, but we just have to get on these flights and we will be good to go. I have never witnessed an adult tantrum to that level. It felt like I was watching a cartoon. At this point, I am ready to just get the hell home and be done with all of htis.

We get the the airport and I say let's get you a wheelchair, that way they can wheel you right up to security, we won't have to wait, and it will make things go a lot easier. 

""NO. I can stand."" I try to convince her it's a log wait, her bag is heavy, it will be fast and we can just sit and relax at the gate, ""NO. I CAN DO IT!"" she snaps loudly at me so that many people in line look back at us. I shut my mouth and just try to get through this. My sister is uncomfortable in the long line, I can tell she is struggling, but she isn't accepting any help, so I am just stuck trying to not piss her off at this point. 

We get to security, I go first do my thing so I can help her get her stuff. My sister... just takes her shoes off, and walks through the xray machine and of course it goes off.  She doesn't say a damn thing to anyone going through this x-ray machine, she has tubes and sacks attached to her body and fucking fedoras on her head, and she just decides, I'll stroll through that x-ray machine just fine. again.. face palm! WTF! is this real life? So of course she gets flagged. I try to explain to them what is going on, and the TSA people tell her she needs to go to another room so they can see all of what is going on under her clothes. Then her bag gets flagged because instead of putting all of her weird shit in her checked bag, she put it in her carry on, including all of her extra medical supplies, like miralax and prune juice. My sister comes back, they ask her about her weird shit, tell her they are throwing out all the powders and liquids, of course, and they get her a wheel chair. The TSA lady who is going through her stuff and helped her through the security check gave her the wheel chair and she refuses it saying she is fine, and if I could find this TSA woman and hug her, I would, she says to my sister: ""no one cares how tough you are right now. you aren't impressing anyone but yourself."" THANK YOU TSA!!!! I try to not laugh, and my sister is upset and we go to the gate.. with no wheelchair. 

You guys.. it just gets worse from her. She got our flight tickets and I didn't see them, and she got us the worst seats on the plane, the ones with no room, next to the toilets, all the way in the back. I ask my sister if she wants to use the bathroom before we go, and she snaps at me no. I ask if I can help put her carry on up for her, ""NO! I can do it."" at this point I put my headphones on, and try to just zone out for the flight. as we get close to our connection in the Denver airport, I can see something is going on with my sister. She has to poop. I tell her I can ask people to move for her since she is technically handicapped, and we can get off the plane, and she snaps, ""I'm Fine!"" even though I can tell she isn't. We finally get to stand up on the plane, and I say, let me get your bag, and she screams at me, ""LEAVE IT ALONE, I CAN DO IT MYSELF!"" 

Everyone on the plane looks back at us. I am mortified, and annoyed at this point, I have been doing my best to be patient, but that crossed the line. We get off the plane, and my sister books it as best as she can with her waddling, carrying her bag, and wearing two fedoras. She comes out of the bathroom, and we start heading to our gate. I quietly and calmly say to her, ""hey, I'm here to help you. Let me help you. You don't have to do all of this on your own. And please realize I am here to help, so don't snap or yell at me in public, it's really upsetting."" 

Her response: ""well, I didn't realize I was going to have to walk on eggshells around you or I would have had someone else come help."" And she starts speed walking (as best as she can.) We get to our gate, I tell her I am going to use the restroom, and I'll be right back. When I get back to the gate, my sister is gone. I text her. nothing. I call her, nothing. My sister has run away from me, her care giver, at the freaking airport! 

I call my brother, and ask him to call her and find out where she is, she doesn't answer. I text her husband, and he eventually finds out she just needed to get away from me and she will meet me at the gate. I have no clue where she is, if she gets hurt, I'm not there to help, and then I realize this is pointless. I've given it my all, and I am succeeding. I decide to go to a bar and get a giant glass of fucking wine and chug it, and then get another. I get to the gate, my sister is there, we get on the plane, she gives me the silent treatment. I put my headphones one, and just pray this flight gets us home as soon as possible. Right before we land my sister turns to me as if nothing has happened and says, ""I bet your dogs are going to be really happy to have you home"" in this normal tone. Stunned to have been yelled at and treated like garbage the whole day, I didn't quite know how to respond so I just said, ""yeah, probably."" She looked really hurt by my short response and didn't speak to me again until we landed.

We finally land in our home town, I get my stuff and start heading into the airport. Our flight was very late, and our airport is tiny, so the people on our flight are the only ones in the airport at this point. We start walking to get our bags, and my sister sits down and starts crying and sobbing right next to our gate, I ask her what is wrong, what is it, and she says ""My head is saying mean things to me."" She continues to sit and cry as everyone gets off the plane and passes us looking at us with concern.

I know it's because I hurt her feelings by giving a short response on the plane, and I tell her  I'm sorry, and let's just get home and we will feel so much better. 

Internally though, I am fucking done. I am emotionally, physically, and mentally done with this trip. I just want to go home and get away from my sister. My parents meet us at the gate to give my sister a ride home, and my husband picks me up. I kid you not, as soon as we see my parents, my sister pulls a complete 180. and goes from crying and upset to happy and cheerful to see my parents and starts telling them what a great trip it was, and I am just stunned. I get my husband we get in the car and I just start bawling. I tell him everything, I feel like I have just been on the biggest mental rollercoaster of my life, and I am done. 

My sister never spoke about the trip again, she just acted like nothing happened. And that's how things ended. I didn't speak to her for a few weeks, and then had to start planning my surgery, so it never got brought up again, but am I crazy? Does this sound like the most deranged trip of all time? AITA for making my sister cry at the end of the trip? Am I an awful person for wanting to just smack those god damn two fedoras off of her head the whole time and tell her to grow up?

1ihxnt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christian/comments/1ihxnt7/rediscovering_biblical_fasting_a_lost_discipline/,Rediscovering Biblical Fasting: A Lost Discipline with Powerful Rewards,"Fasting is one of the most overlooked spiritual disciplines in modern Christianity. While it was a **core practice** for Jesus, the apostles, and early Christians, today, it’s often dismissed or reduced to “giving up coffee or social media.” But biblical fasting is much more than that—it’s a **spiritual weapon** that helps us overcome sin, grow in self-discipline, and draw closer to God.

Jesus didn’t say if we fast—He said when we fast:

*“The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.” (Luke 5:35)*

After Christ ascended, the apostles fasted to seek God’s will. The early church fathers followed suit, believing fasting helped subdue the flesh and strengthen the spirit. **Augustine wrote:**

*“Fasting cleanses the soul, raises the mind, and subjects one’s flesh to the spirit.”*

Personally, I’ve found fasting to be one of the most **transformative** practices in my spiritual walk. It’s a reminder that we are not ruled by our bodies, but by the Spirit. As Paul said:

*“I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.” (1 Corinthians 9:27)*

Yet, in many churches today, fasting has been **watered down.** Many Christians try “soft fasting”—giving up a comfort for a season—but fasting in Scripture meant abstaining from food, sometimes for extended periods. This wasn’t just a symbolic gesture; it was a **deep spiritual practice** that led to breakthroughs, repentance, and greater intimacy with God.

So, I’m curious—how has fasting played a role in your spiritual life? Have you ever experienced a breakthrough or a deeper closeness to God through it?",2,1738716734.0,Christian,2,1.0,False

1ihxlwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1ihxlwz/dear_j/,Dear J,"When we first met, we both weren't looking to settle in a relationship. 
You were trying to find a new job, to start over in a way. 
But months after months, we started to develop feelings for each other, we were hanging out every week, spending weekends together, going on dates,... 

And then, that one weekend I'll always remember happened. 
We spent the whole weekend telling each other that we were “biting our tongues” to not say those three little words. 
And on Saturday night, you were the first one to say it.
I love you.
In the moment it felt like heaven on earth, I was in love with an amazing person, and they loved me back. 

We spent the following months seeing each other whenever we had the time, went on weekends, you introduced me to your family, and I to mine.
It was the happiest I have ever been in a while.
Of course, it wasn’t perfect, nothing really is.
But it was us, our love.

You finally got your job, and started the training for it.
I did everything I could to support you, to be there for you, because I knew how much it meant to you.
I took care of you when you were sick, I got you little gifts I knew you would love, I cooked for you, I listened and was always there, in your good times as much as the bad ones.

We spent Christmas and New Year's Eve together, I cooked your favorite meal, lit candles, and made sure everything was as perfect as they could be.
 
On January 1st, you were distant, but didn’t want to talk about it.
You just said you needed space, and I gave it to you.
After a week of little to no contact, we finally talked.
You said you lost feelings, and that there was no point in continuing our relationship, that you were more focused on your work than on us, and you lost feelings.
You wanted to remain friends, I wish I was able to, but I can’t.

You came back the weekend after to take all the things you left at my place, without saying a word.
It was hard for me, really hard, in a span of a week, I had lost my best friend, my lover.
I wasn’t mad at you, even now, just lost.

Then we met at a coffee shop two weeks after to talk, I wrote everything I wanted to say, and you listened.
You told me that you realised that you were so stressed and focused on your job that all that stress hid the feelings you had for me.
We spent the afternoon talking, we laughed, it was like I found you once more.
The weekend after we played games online, had fun, it was great.
But then, you went back to being cold and distant, like you were someone else.

I knew you had exams this week, so I wished you good luck.
And what I got back was the coldest “thanks” I ever received.
Then you restricted me during the night, just like that.

I guess I will never know why, why did you ran away when we planned to move in together at the end of your training, when we made plans to do trips together, to go on more weekends away to discover the world together.

A week before the break up, you talked about things we could do to decorate our place once we move in together.
You even asked your parents for a voucher for a fancy restaurant so we could go together.

I have no resentment towards you, just confusion.
If it’s all related to the stress of your training, it’s not like it’s something that would have lasted forever.
You said I did everything right, but why am I the one hurting, why do I have to lose everything.

You moved on, you’re focusing on your work, going out with your friends, you even told me you slept with someone two weeks after we broke up.
That’s probably what hurts the most, it looks like it doesn’t affect you.
Like we were never anything for you, like I never mattered.

So now I guess I will just have to bear the pain, to try to piece myself together.
Know that I still love you, and I probably always will, that’s who I am.

I wish you good luck with your new job, I hope you succeed and you find your happiness.

However, they sent me a straight bottomless portafilter instead. What’s more concerning is that it has no branding and came in just a clear plastic bag—no box or markings.

For those who have purchased a genuine straight Profitec bottomless portafilter, did yours also come unbranded and in clear plastic packaging? Or does this seem like they’ve sent me a generic non-genuine one?

I’ve reached out to their support, but they’re completely ignoring me. Would love to hear from anyone who has experience with this.

Thanks!

1ihxkr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1ihxkr0/have_you_experienced_gaslighting_after_leaving/,"Have you experienced gaslighting after leaving the church, or is my family just nuts?","I try to avoid faith based topics or debates with my family since I have left, so I don't often get hit with a lot of apologetics about major church stuff. But I find that certain things that happened within my lifetime my family remembers differently.

As a child, we always had only caffeine free soda, only herbal tea. Absolutely no coffee. I remember vividly having my N64 taken away for drinking Dr. Pepper (not knowing it had caffeine, because my family had always simplified it to coke). The church (and family as a result) could now care less about soda. As an adult, I mentioned in passing to my mother about how I'm glad my nieces can drink coke now-- she got extremely defensive and insisted neither she or the church had ever forbade caffeinated soda. When I brought up the specific event she insisted she doesn't remember that at all.

This has been happening with a lot of little things. She denies we participated in door knocking for Prop 8, saying that was a personal choice for members but we never did that and the church never directly instructed it. She insists I misremember a traumatic part of doing baptisms for the dead (getting nude in a large room of girls and showering with no curtains). Denies ever talking to me about polygamy in heaven. Something exceptionally crazy that goes beyond the mormon brainwashing, despite having two DNA tests proving that I have a different father than my siblings, she insists that the DNA tests are wrong. With the exception of the DNA thing, my grandparents, aunts and uncles all have the same habit, that the church never did something that happened to me within my lifetime.

Does anyone elses family do this? She is unsuccessful in making me doubt my experiences, but I am wondering if she is legitimately mentally ill or if this just is par for the course of mormon boomers.",57,1738716493.0,exmormon,38,0.99,False

We met freshman year of college and stayed together both through college and grad school supporting each other in our journey and we are very very happy together and very much in love and living in a beautiful home. My parents as a grad school gift to both my husband and I took us out to a very nice dinner and gave us a surprise gift for a weekend get away. They really went above and beyond and we are beyond appreciative. That being said my MIL (she is a single mom) just pointing that fact out to show there isn’t a FIL in the picture so I don’t get any comments such as, “why are you blaming the MIL and not the FIL as well?” My MIL gave just my husband a card with cash and nothing to me. And yes it was made very clear this gift was just for him alone and it wasn’t an assumed card for the couple if that makes sense. According to my husband the verbiage surrounding the card and cash was, “I’m so proud of you son for graduating I know how hard you worked towards your goal of graduating.” I’m very hurt I wasn’t included in the card. It’s not about me getting cash it’s the fact this wasn’t addressed to both of us as husband and wife when we are MARRIED and we literally both just graduated. To me it should automatically be second nature when the person your child has been with since your child was a teenager and who is his wife and DIL and they both achieved this milestone at the same time to include their name together on the card and just address it to the two of them as a married couple. It’s not even like he graduated and got a solo gift from his mother and then I graduated a few months later and she overlooked me. We could at least chalk it up to well she may have forgotten but no in this case we graduated at the same time and so this feels more purposeful like only her son’s hard work matters and is being recognized and not her. At the very least if she wanted to give her son a separate card I dunno I couldn’t get a small bouquet of flowers, a $20 gift card to a local coffee shop, a card with a handwritten note. Something? My parents treated us both equally and like a married unit when we graduated and my MIL was very much aware of that fact. 

My question is AITA for stepping back from our relationship and being a little more cold to her now because I’m seeing I’m clearly not as important to her as I thought?

I could be the AH for freezing her out without knowing what she did to bother me.

At 8:59 AM, footsteps echoed. A shadow loomed. And there he was Jerry (not also the real name lol) from accounting, chugging the last of the pot straight from the carafe like a caffeinated Viking.

""Jerry!"" Kevin leapt out. ""We've caught you coffee-handed!""

Jerry wiped his mouth and sighed. ""Look, man… I need this. My twins wake up at 4 AM. I haven’t slept since 2019.""

Two years had passed since I met her, and I had never had a friendship like this before. She was 30, I was 31, and we seemed to orbit around each other in a way that felt too perfect to ignore. At first, I didn’t think much of it, but as the months unfolded, I began to notice how much we had in common—how we could finish each other’s sentences, how we both loved the same quiet coffee shops, the same rainy days. She made me laugh like no one else could, and for the first time in my life, I felt seen, really seen, by someone. The kind of seeing that made me feel less like a cliché and more like I mattered.

She was always there for me, not just in the big moments but in the quiet ones too, when I needed a friend the most. And I began to fall for her. Slowly at first, like a ripple spreading across calm water. Her kindness was a balm to my soul, a peace I didn’t know I needed, but had been craving for years.

For the longest time, I told myself I couldn’t fall for her. I couldn’t risk it. I’d promised myself I wouldn’t make a fool of myself again, that I wouldn’t let my heart be shattered. I had only loved once before, and it had ended in ways I couldn’t undo. But, of course, I fell. I fell because she made me feel something I hadn't in a long time: safe. She made me feel cherished, like my kindness wasn’t a weakness but something worth protecting.

By the time I gathered the courage to ask her out, Christmas Eve rolled around. The snow was falling outside, the world wrapped in a soft, white silence, and there I was, sitting on her couch, heart racing. I took a deep breath and asked, ""Do you want to start dating?""

Her response was… not what I expected. It wasn’t the rejection I feared, nor was it a resounding yes. It was something in between, something that left me confused but oddly hopeful. She said she swore it wasn’t about me, that I’d be “the one that got away” if she didn’t choose me, but that right now, with everything going on in her life, she wasn’t ready. She needed time to adjust. She didn’t want to lose what we had, and she assured me that nothing would change between us.

I nodded, holding her gaze, and said I understood. I promised her that no matter what, nothing would change. I wasn’t going anywhere.

In the days that followed, I thought about it. I played out different scenarios in my head, trying to figure out what it all meant. Three possibilities crossed my mind:

1. She was being honest, and maybe, just maybe, when she was ready, we’d be together.


2. She had once wanted to be with me but had found someone else in the time we’d spent as best friends, and now she was waiting to see if they would make a move.


3. She had always wanted us to be nothing more than friends, and all of those sweet words had been her way of making sure I didn’t leave because of how much she valued our friendship.



I wasn’t sure which one was true, and part of me didn’t want to know. I had to accept it, whatever it was. My heart ached, yes, but not in the way it once had. It wasn’t the kind of pain that made me want to run. It was a quiet, bittersweet understanding. I loved her more than I had ever loved anyone, and if that meant I’d never experience the kind of love she gave someone else, then I could live with it.

We still hung out every day. Nothing had changed on the surface. We still linked arms when we walked together, still shared our favorite shopping adventures, still watched the same movies late into the night. Nothing had changed—except the unspoken thing between us that I could never quite name.

And maybe that was okay.

Because I knew her. I knew that even if she fell in love with someone else, she wouldn’t let that change our bond. She wasn’t the type to let a relationship get in the way of a friendship. I’d seen it before. She’d walk away from anyone who tried to break what we had.

So, I stayed. Best friends. Even if I was the one who would always wonder what might have been.

But sometimes, in the quiet moments when I saw her smile at me, when she leaned her head against mine as we watched our favorite show, I thought maybe, just maybe, we were already living something beautiful. Something that didn’t need labels or definitions. Something that was, in its own way, perfect.

And I was okay with that.

I feel anxious and on edge constantly. Mainly because of interactions with others. 

It feels like everyone is super standoffish with me and secretly all hate me for no reason. People barely give me a chance and before it seems they've gotten to know me I'm being shut out of things. I never get invited anywhere. Even lunch or coffee. Even the people at work who do have lunch with me it feels like they only tolerate me and would rather I not be there. 

It feels like girls constantly think I'm hitting on them and treat me with a cold distance. I always get the same look if I ever try and interact with them, like I'm bothering them.

Even tonight I play volleyball and a former coworker was there. I tried saying hi and I got one word answers. I just walked away. It constantly feels people are trying to get away from me and I don't know why. I don't do anything that I can recognize that causes this. 

I don't feel like I've ever been allowed to have a normal life. I just want my tribe. Now after so many years alone, I am also standoffish with people as when they ask me my plans for the weekend I'm scared to tell them nothing because they'll think I'm a loser. Or I think they're trying to get something from me.

I've made some social faux pas' in the past years ago and now ir eels like there's a groupchat where everyone in the city knows me and talks shit about me and they're all in on it and I'm not. Once they meet me I feel like they all point and say there's that guy we all hate.
