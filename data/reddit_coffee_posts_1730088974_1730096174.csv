I‚Äôve been renting this apartment for a while but I absolutely hate it. I haven‚Äôt changed anything at all because I leave in 10 months but I thought that maybe I could do a light glow up to the living room. 

I unfortunately can‚Äôt share any pics bc my roommate doesn‚Äôt want me to. 

There‚Äôs a cheap grey sofa, and a cheap navy armchair that I hate, is there any what I can make them look better? 

Also the floor is a very saturated shade of brown (so is the coffee table and the side table). I thought that maybe I could add a carpet or rug to cover most of the floor but I don‚Äôt know how to go about doing so. Would table cloth work to cover the coffee table‚Äôs unsightly colour? 

It‚Äôs my first place so I don‚Äôt know much about decorating, let alone rent-friendly decorating.

SO I went to college, graduated with an advertising/pr & marketing degree in 2019. After graduating moved to a big city; got a job working in food/beverage. I worked at a coffee shop for 5 years and this past summer, the coffee shop closed for renovations & subsequently fired the ENTIRE store... (all 13 of us) during the middle of the renovations ... I was lucky and found a job a week later, at another coffee shop! but it was NOT what I expected... this new shop was insanely busy, tiny, no bathroom, no walk in, it was almost like an airport coffee shop and attached to a hotel in a fancy area. It very much gave me burnout & was a very far commute for me. Anyways, I lasted 3 months and put in my 2 weeks notice, ON VERY GOOD TERMS.  the manager told me I could use him as a reference and also was welcome back to work any time I wanted. 

my dilemma is I want to find a job related to Entertainment or media & get out of the food/beverage industry. I want to switch careers after this mess of being betrayed by the first coffee job and then the chaos of the second. I want a challenge and change and to grow. I stayed so long in coffee cause my team at the first shop was truly amazing and now im re-evaluating. BUT Do I keep the 2nd job on my resume even if it was only 3 months (but on very good terms?) I know it looks bad. or should I keep it off and deal with explaining the renovation issue at the first coffee shop ? ( I am worried if I leave off the 2nd shop HR may pick it up in a background check) currently it says ""Present"" on my resume as if im still working there but I fear I should change it in case HR does a employee check and sees I quit a month ago. Or just change it and have it be super dang short. HELP what should I do. ( I do have a side part time gig to help me while I search) and I know it isn't smart to quit without something but I genuinely cried after every shift and was becoming a different person over coffee shop gig.

**AITA for breaking up with my fianc√©e for telling her best friend she was not engaged?**

&#x200B;

My now ex-fianc√©e (30F) and me (M27) got engaged 3 weeks ago. We've been dating for 5 years and I finally got the money to give her the wedding she wanted. Well, 3 days ago we were discussing our guest list, and I asked if she wanted to invite her best friend, let's call him James (M30). James lives in another state, but since they were friends for 10 years, I thought I could even pay for his travel expenses since it would be great to have her best friend at the wedding.

She denied, saying that it would take a lot of work to bring him, and she wanted to be a ""family"" event. Countless times she mentioned that James was like family to her, so I insisted, she got annoyed and said ""I didn't even told him we were engaged"". That took me by surprise, I tried to ask why, but she started stonewalling me, and I left her alone. After a couple of hours, I tried to ask her again why she haven't told him we were engaged, and she still refused to tell me, and I admit, my insecurity got the better of me.

In the past, James had confessed he had feelings for her, which she turned down and basically friendzoned him. But by the way she told me, it always sounded like she had him as a backup, something not only me, but her exes realized. She ""married"" him online, they always made they WoW characters look like a couple (like wearing the same transmog and shit like that), when she had a fight with her exes, he was ""always there for her"" and etc.

I told her that made me uncomfortable and if she was not planning to tell him, she might as well consider herself single, cause I would not marry someone who couldn't be honest. Yes, I was pretty immature, but she did something even more immature, she texted him while showing me her phone something like ""hey, just so you know, I was engaged, but not anymore"" and send it to him. I told her to pack her things and leave my house.

Ever since she left, she has been calling me, but I refused to answer. My mom called me (because she apparently called my mom), and said that I was an asshole for ending things for such a ""ridiculous"" thing.

So, AITA?

Edit: sorry for the typo in the title

Edit 2: hey guys, I made some dinner and I think I'm gonna go with u/DoneOver69Position (cool username btw). I'm gonna ask her to meet up and ask to see their messages. And to u/FoxySlyOldStoatyFox, I'm already low contact with my mom, but I'm going to make my decisions after I clear everything up. So I'm kinda promising an update.

**Miserable-Most-1265**

*NTA, there is a reason she won't tell her ""best friend"" that she plans on getting married. I mean most women think getting married is one of the biggest things in life, and tells everyone she knows. Unless it will put a damper of something. You know boyfriends hate hearing their girlfriend is getting married*

&#x200B;

**Wise\_Focus\_309**

*The night I proposed, I am pretty sure that my wife was on the phone before I even heard a ""yes"" with as many people as she could think to call!*

&#x200B;

**rangebob**

*haha right ? mine was still naked when she started calling people*

&#x200B;

**Ok-Ad3906**

*Lol my husband and I had been to a friend's wedding earlier that day.*

*Lying in bed watching TV later, he said ""We should get married.""*

*He'd mentioned it before (but 'reneged') so I was like, ""(Yeah right) OK, sure.""*

*He said, ""I'm going to call my mom.""*

*I realized he was 100% serious this time. (He's NOT a 'mama's boy', but that's how I knew he meant it, lmao).*

*I waited until he called her and put her on speakerphone and THEN I called people, lol.*

*14 years together and 10 married, one child. So I get it!*

&#x200B;

**DoneOver69Position**

*So your ex fiancee didn't want to tell her boyfriend about you. Unless you poly sounds like a great reason to end an engagement.*

*If you want to confirm that she was cheating, offer to meet up with her for lunch. When you get there, tell her if she wants any chance with you she needs to unlock her phone, and you read all of her messages between him and her on all media. I'm sure you will find more than enough to confirm that leaving is the best choice.*

**siren2040**

*.... Even in a poly relationship that's still messed up, lying, and cheating. Polyamory requires honesty and transparency on each of the relationships*

**DoneOver69Position**

*Poly allows you to make rules based off of how you and your partner agree. I have known a couple of people who have had successful don't ask don't tell polyamorous relationships. That is their choice and how they choose to be. That is the only time I could figure out how this could possibly be okay. That is why I put that exception. But some people who are poly don't accept don't ask don't tell us a viable relationship, and to that I say allow people to make their own choices on how they choose to be in a relationship the same way you would like people to allow you to choose. Personally with my 16 years experience with polyamory, I prefer kitchen table poly, but I also accept that people have different things that work for them.*

*You‚Äôve done well to get rid of one woman who claims to love you but fundamentally doesn‚Äôt respect you and believes you should be eat shit in your relationships.*

**Update - 1 days later**

&#x200B;

Hey guys, I just got home after talking to my (still) ex-fiancee, and since a lot of people asked for an update, here it is. But, I want to clarify a few things.

As commented on my original post, I pay for the house since I bought it before dating her and I asked her to move in, since it was close to her job. I work from home since I'm in tech, but she had to go to work, that's why I paid for her car, to help her commute (and honestly her salary is shit). I was her partner, so I didn't see any problem with that. I thought she was the one, despite everything, she is smart, funny, we had chemistry, but I felt betrayed.

To the update.

We met at a coffee shop on the premise we would discuss how to save our relationship, at least, that's what she thought. As soon as we sat down, I asked to see their messages. She got defensive immediately and told me she had deleted everything. I asked to see her phone anyway. She started to cry, ugly cry, asking me to stop. At that point I had already decided I was not going to be part of the relationship anymore, but damn, I was curious. It took a good 20 minutes for her to hand me her phone, a lot of crying, even a waitress asking her if she was ok.

So I read the messages. There wasn't any cheating like nudes being exchanged, them professing their love for each other, but what I read still stung. There was a lot of shit talking about me. A LOT. Texts and texts of them saying how terrible of a person I was, criticizing my hobbies (i like video games and pro wrestling) saying I wasn't a real man because of them and stuff like that. But there where two topics that caught my eye. One where she had told him I was having trouble getting hard and that was frustrating for her. And one where she was complaining about how she didn't want to be ""stuck"" in our relationship.

Yes, I was having problems in bed... because I was sad because my father had passed away (6 months ago) and the ""stuck"" thing, I remember telling her that when we got married, IF SHE WANTED she could leave her job, and I would provide for both of us. I don't know if she took this the wrong way, but I guess it was related to that. I honestly don't know.

By the time I gave her the phone back, she was already giving excuses on why she was saying those things to him, how he was like a ""therapist"" for her, and then she asked me ""don't you complaining about me to your friends?"" and I simply replied ""no, I don't"". She started crying again. I took a pretty deep breath and just said ""just give me the ring back"" (I didn't had the ring with me, like some suggested). She hesitated a bit, but gave it to me anyway. I stood up and asked her to delete my number and to not bother me anymore.

I called her mom and asked her to pick up her daughter's stuff at my place. Her mom is a good person, I'm just realizing I'm going to miss her as I write this. She understood why I decided to end it, but she didn't asked much, and to be honest, I'm glad she didn't. As for my mom, I didn't called her, I just blocked her for things unrelated to this post, I just realized she never had my back in anything, I was always trying to save an already failed mom-son relationship.

Before I leave, I just want to clarify. I was never against her having male friends, or any type of friends. People are going to cheat, friends or no friends. I remember my dad saying something to me when I was a teenager, he always said ""opportunity makes the thief"", but I do not agree with that. Anyway, since I have the next two weeks off work, I going to figure what to do with the wedding money, drink some booze, play games and watch Monday Night Raw later.

Peace.

PS: sorry for any typos, but I fixed the title now.

Edit: a couple of people are asking about the car. Is a 2015 Nissan Versa which she crashed 2 times, both times she rear ended someone. Never liked the car, weak engine, the interior feels cheap and overall bad, so for all I care she can keep that piece of shit. I would have more luck throwing it off a cliff than selling it.

Edit 2: Little update. Her mom called me a few hours ago to check on me and to ask when she could come and pick up ex's stuff. We spoke about the car and she basically ""forbid"" me to let her daughter keep the car because: 1 - I paid for it. 2 - Ex wouldn't be able to maintain it. So I'm going to keep the car until I'm able to sell it (god help me).

Also, some people called the story fake, cause they said I wasn't a ""real man"" for playing games, and yet they played WoW. To be honest, that's on me, cause I wasn't very clear. The ""real man"" thing was more about the pro wrestling hobby than the gaming hobby, but in some messages they clearly mocked me for playing some games (Life is Strange Series) in one I remember James saying something like ""How could a grown ass man play such a girly game and cry?"" Yes, I cried playing Life is Strange. I also cried to RDR2 (the I'm afraid cutscene still makes me emotional). I'm a crybaby I guess.

Also I want to thank everyone who message me to talk about wrestling and games, it really helped me take my mind out of everything. I haven't replied to everyone, but I intend to. If anything happens, I'll let you guys know. Be good people.

\*\***New Update - 10 days later\*\***

&#x200B;

Hey guys! It's been a couple of days since I used this account to tell my story, and somethings happened, but this is a positive update.

First I want to say thank you to everyone who reached out in my DM's and commented saying nice things, it felt really good and I appreciate yall, some of you actually made me tear up with your kind messages. Second, I saw my two previous posts were in a YT video of a guy who reads reddit posts and my update was on r/BestofRedditorUpdates (a sub reddit I read a lot) and that caught me off guard, but I want to express my gratitude for everyone who gave me advice, told their own story or just told me I was a cool guy, reading your messages before writing this felt amazing.

I also want to say I thought about my engagedment a lot, and I have no regrets whatsoever. Yeah, things ended badly and she was not a good person to me at the end, but I just don't hate her, nor do I wish for her to fail. We had good moments, I felt happy with her and again I really thought she was the one. Felling hatred was going to harm me more than her.

To the update. Her mom came to pick up her stuff and we talked for hours, it felt like therapy. I cried on her shoulders, we laughed, she expressed how much I meant to her family, and that I would be always welcome in her home. It felt so good to hear her say those things to me. Before she left she asked me if I wanted to ask about my ex, I got curious and asked how she was doing. Her words were ""she's trying to act stoic, but I know my daughter, she's not taking this well"". I left it at that. She gave me a hug and left.

About the car, I'm going to donate it and get a tax write off. But to the thing I'm excited about, is that I'm going to Royal Rumble, I never even watched Raw or Smackdown live, but now that I have the extra cash, I'm going to treat myself.

Again, thank you all for reaching out, sorry to the people who love drama that this update doesn't have a unwanted pregnancy, a fight, chaos or a plot twist, the truth is that my live is just really really boring.

Be kind people.

1gdv8se,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcAbuseAndDivorce/comments/1gdv8se/has_anyone_else_had_a_past_mental_health/,Has anyone else had a past mental health diagnosis weaponized in a custody battle?,"When I was six, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a label that‚Äôs followed me for nearly three decades. Despite this, I rarely displayed any typical symptoms, and over the years, various professionals questioned the diagnosis‚Äîeven my ex. When I first told her, she said, ‚ÄúI had a bipolar roommate‚Äîyou‚Äôre nothing like that. It sounds like a misdiagnosis.‚Äù I‚Äôm not medicated and have never exhibited behaviors that align with the diagnosis. So, I mostly dismissed it‚Äîuntil it began being used against me in arguments with my wife.

To give you some context, my wife herself has shown signs of serious, concerning issues‚Äîpossibly an undiagnosed personality disorder, postpartum complications, or something else entirely. Her traits are intensely narcissistic, and the only person worse is her mother, with whom she is deeply enmeshed. Our relationship started off wonderful, but after the birth of our child, my MIL became demanding and controlling, pushing for more access. When I tried to set boundaries, she threw a fit and began what feels like an all-out campaign to manipulate my wife into divorcing me so that she could take on the role of loving mother and idealized co-parent. And unfortunately, her strategy seems to be working, though the entire argument is built on a house of cards.

Before our separation, my wife continuously brought up my diagnosis after arguments in what I now recognize as reactionary abuse. For example:

* During one argument, she said, ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs a choice between you and my parents, you won‚Äôt like it.‚Äù That comment broke me. When I reacted, she immediately dismissed my feelings, saying it was just my ‚Äúbipolar‚Äù talking.
* She went as far as reaching out to my parents, expressing her supposed ‚Äúconcerns‚Äù about my mental health (classic triangulation).
* On Easter, my wife prevented me from spending time with her and our daughter because my MIL wanted to show off our child to her friends‚Äîan event I wasn‚Äôt even invited to. I got upset and walked around the city to clear my head. This is what she called a hypomanic episode.

The list goes on and on, with each incident feeling more manipulative than the last. She kept urging me to see a psychiatrist as she was so concerned for my mental health. Something didn't feel right, so I began consulting with therapists, psychiatrists, and neuropsychologists to evaluate me. They did just that and confirmed that I am not bipolar and that it was a childhood misdiagnosis. With that being said, they did, however, identify spikes in anxiety and depression, which they attributed to the toll of an emotionally and psychologically abusive relationship. I wonder where that was coming from.

Fast-forward a few months, and my wife is now divorcing me, using this outdated diagnosis to try to obtain 100% custody of our daughter. She claims that my ‚Äúbipolar‚Äù diagnosis, which she has no evidence of, is a safety risk to her and our daughter. What evidence does she have of this concerning mental health condition:

* I drank coffee one day and not the next.
* I walk with my daughter in a stroller around the neighborhood each morning.
* I listened to the same song on repeat one evening.
* I used ‚Äúbaby talk‚Äù while changing our daughter at the pediatrician‚Äôs office.
* I picked up a romantic meal for us 0.5 miles away by foot.,

The list goes on, each example more laughable than the last. These ‚Äúconcerns‚Äù are part of her official court documents and I wouldn‚Äôt believe it myself if they weren‚Äôt written down and filed with the court.

She has no idea that I‚Äôve been re-evaluated and cleared. Her and her mother‚Äôs relentless attacks have destroyed our marriage, fractured our family, and ended any plans we once had for our daughter‚Äôs future. It‚Äôs stunning to see not just the level of manipulation but the complete lack of empathy and compassion for me.

To add further context, my wife‚Äôs departure from the relationship was truly traumatic. She abruptly left, took our daughter without warning, withheld her from me for 45 days, lied about what was going on, and initiated the divorce through an email from her attorney instead of contacting me directly. Since then, she‚Äôs slandered me, filed countless lies, and done everything to paint me as an unfit parent. Each document contradicts the last, and her story keeps shifting‚Äîit‚Äôs truly mind-blowing.

We have a big court date coming up, and I can‚Äôt help but wonder: what happens when she realizes her narrative doesn‚Äôt hold up? When she faces the consequences of her actions and her mother‚Äôs influence? I‚Äôd appreciate any insights from those who‚Äôve been through something similar. For now, I‚Äôm focused on protecting my daughter, but I keep wondering how the truth will ultimately land.",1,1730095259.0,NarcAbuseAndDivorce,1,1.0,False

1gdv641,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoSleepAuthors/comments/1gdv641/everyone_got_off_at_the_port_except_me/,"Everyone got off at the port, except me.","I'm writing this on a bus, coming home early from a frustrated trip. I can't stop thinking about what happened, and I feel like I need to share it with someone else.¬†

This year, a few friends and I decided to take a vacation together and go on a beach trip, planning to stay for about a week. We arranged for everyone to take time off at the same time and rented a house on the coast of a neighboring state.

At first, everything went smoothly, I took the bus around nine PM, and knowing that the trip would take around three hours, I put on my headphones, reclined the seat and enjoyed the view. We agreed to meet at the town‚Äôs port.

At a certain point in the journey, the bus stopped, and the driver informed us he‚Äôd be making a brief stop in a town near our final destination. I went to a restaurant, grabbed some coffee and a sandwich, which I barely had time to finish before the bus started moving again.

I was dozing off when I felt the bus stop. The driver turned off the engine, the lights came on and the passengers began to get off. I quickly looked out the window to check that I was in the right place, and after seeing some containers, I got off too.

That's when things started to get weird.

As soon as I stepped out, I noticed there were no other passengers around, which felt odd since it had been barely twenty seconds since everyone had disembarked. The place I was standing in was just part of the road; it didn‚Äôt even look like a bus stop, much less the port and bus station that my friends had mentioned earlier. The only sign of life nearby was a gate with a guard booth and, inside, a collection of containers and cranes that looked like a shipping company.

When I tried to get back on the bus, to ask the driver if I hadn't gotten off at the wrong stop, he had already left.

I looked at my phone, paused the music, and checked the time: midnight sharp. I called one of my friends to let them know I had ‚Äúarrived,‚Äù hoping that this was the right place. No answer. I only managed to send a quick message ‚Äì ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm at the port‚Äù ‚Äì before my battery died. Apparently, listening to music for three hours straight was just too much for my old phone. With no idea what else to do, I approached the guard booth to ask for information.

Inside was a woman, who smiled when she saw me approaching. I asked her if I was in the right place and explained a little bit of the situation.¬†

""Ah, the port? Oh, no, you‚Äôre far away, about five miles I believe, my dear."" She replied, with a big smile and a voice a little... strange.

I can't explain it, but the woman seemed *off*. Her skin looked different, in a way that I couldn't tell whether she was 26 or 62, and her voice didn't sound natural. At the time I didn't pay much attention to any of this, but in retrospect, it seemed as if she wasn't human, but something *trying* to be human.

""But if you want, you can go through here, James and I will take you to the port, *everything will be fine!""* She said while gesturing to a colleague who was near the gate.

I hadn't noticed the colleague before. In fact, it's is as if he appeared out of nowhere as soon as she called him. He came towards me, with the same huge smile and strange skin.

For some reason, that gave me chills. Those two looking at me, piercing me with their eyes, and with that sinister smile, almost drooling, as if I were a dish from a five-star restaurant. Something told me not to wait for this ‚ÄúJames‚Äù guy to approach, so I walked away, muttering a goodbye.

I couldn't see much ahead, just the road and the silhouette of vegetation on both sides of the asphalt. There were no streetlights except one in front of the ‚Äúcompany,‚Äù and likely none for the next five miles. I started walking, but I soon realized that it would be a long trek, so I raised my thumb in hope that someone passing by would give me a ride.

And it didn't take long for a truck driver to pull up next to me. I got close to his window, and to my surprise, he didn't look right either*.* He was an older man, or at least I think it was because of his white hair, but he had the same strange skin as the woman and ‚ÄúJames‚Äú I just met. He invited me into the truck, saying he would take me to the port in no time. Strange, because I hadn't even told him where I wanted to go.

""Come on, kid, I'll take you there, you won't even notice! You can sleep if you're tired. *Everything will be fine!""* The old man insisted. He spoke in the same strange, weirdly *broken* way as the other two.

The chill I had felt before now intensified, and it went up my spine like an electric shock. I didn't even bother to say something to the truck driver, I just moved on, quickening my pace. He just stood there.

From then on, I started to walk faster. I had a weird feeling, as if things weren‚Äôt right, and what scared me the most: that something was watching me.

I rounded a bend in the road and saw a broken guardrail and a crashed car beyond it. It looked like the accident had happened some time ago, but obviously, the scene didn‚Äôt help with my anxiety at all.

The further I got, the more unsettling the place became. The air grew heavy, and I started to hear noises in the vegetation, twigs snapping, leaves rustling. I was getting exhausted from the walk, and my eyes were strained from trying to see in the pitch-dark.

After about two hours of walking, just past another curve, this time forming a big ""S"" along with the previous one, a car stopped next to me. It was an old hatchback, probably from the '90s. I couldn‚Äôt see much, but the car looked run-down. At this point, I was obviously no longer hitchhiking, and my paranoia made me completely suspicious of whoever the driver was.

And with good reason.

""Get in, Alex, I'll take you to the port."" He said, calmly.

""HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?"" I shouted, desperate.

""What do you mean, Alex? We all know your name. We just want to help you! Trust us, *everything will be fine!""* He replied, lifting his head and looking directly at me, with the same massive, twisted smile as the others.

Taking a good look at his face, he looked almost identical to the truck driver, like twins, both equally disfigured and weird.

This time, I ran.

I ran like I‚Äôd never run before, without even looking back to see if anything was following me.

I must have run for another two hours until exhaustion took over, and I sat down on the roadside. Everything seemed quiet and safe. Too safe. I opened my backpack to take the last sip from my water bottle when I began to hear them.

Voices, coming from the bushes next to me. At first, I couldn‚Äôt make out what they were saying, but slowly I began to recognize my name being called.

""Alex... Alex... come this way, Alex... it's a shortcut, Alex... *everything will be fine*, Alex.""

The feeling of safety soon turned to horror, and I went back running.

The voices grew louder, more distorted, and when I inevitably looked back, my fears were confirmed.

There was a man ‚Äì no, a *creature* ‚Äì chasing me. It was humanoid, but with disproportionate limbs and a bizarre skin, as if it were imitating human skin, which writhed and twisted. And it was smiling at me.

I ran awkwardly, totally consumed by fear, crying and screaming. I almost started praying when I saw a streetlight ahead.

As I got closer, I saw the sea, containers, docked ships, a lighthouse in the distance, and a small group of people. It was the port. I stopped running but was still paranoid and anxious, so I avoided contact with anyone.

Then I saw the bus arrive, and exactly the same passengers who were with me got off. Soon I also saw my friends approaching. They were drinking and laughing, and when they saw me, they ran over, shouting and cheering to celebrate my arrival. One of tried to talk to me, asking me why I was looking terrible, sweating, dirty, and shaking.

I just lit a cigarette, walked with them to the house, a few blocks away, and told them that I was extremely tired and needed some sleep.

When I got there, I left my things in my room, plugged in my phone to charge and went to take a shower. There was a clock in the hallway, and, giving me one last moment of terror, it showed twelve-oh-five.

The next day, my friends woke me up asking about what had happened the night before and why I seemed so scared.

I tried to tell the story, but obviously no one believed it.

Some said I was lying, or that I was smoking some really good stuff. I even opened Google Maps to show where that company was, where everything had supposedly happened, but, to my surprise, I couldn‚Äôt find it.

There was no ""S"" curve on the road. In fact, the road between the town where I stopped to eat and the port of the town we were in was completely straight, well-lit, and without companies, gates or containers. There was even a gas station halfway through, which I sure as shit didn't see last night.

Amid all the jokes and questions, one of the people in the room, who I didn't really know, approached me and said:

""Relax, Alex, I think you just had a weird dream. You're with us now, *everything will be fine.""* He broke into a giant smile as he said those last words in a distorted way.

At that moment I ran up the stairs, grabbed my backpack and went straight to the port to wait for the next bus, without saying anything to anyone.",1,1730094926.0,NoSleepAuthors,1,1.0,False

This coworker is someone who eats at our team lunches sometimes, which are infrequent for my team because we work from home, he is someone my boss knows so she invites him along at times. 

He added me on Instagram early this year because I was sharing info about an art exhibition I was having. 

At first it was just normal stuff: liking my art posts and stories. However if I post any sort of selfie in my story or a video talking about my art he will give me a heart eye emoji, or tell me I‚Äôm beautiful. Sometimes his comments are super late at night too. My responses to him are always short and mostly delayed by several hours or a few days, I say  ‚Äúthanks!‚Äù And I answer his questions only about my art or my cat, I don‚Äôt ask him any questions. 

I am in the office 1-2x per week because it‚Äôs mandatory. He did see me recently when I went to the break room for coffee and said something like, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen you in awhile. Why don‚Äôt I see you here more at the office?‚Äù But he knows my boss, he knows my team and that we‚Äôre remote.. so I just answered and said I had to get back to my desk for a meeting and told him to have a good day. 

Anyway, I don‚Äôt want to be rude because I don‚Äôt want him to come seek me out and try to talk to me about it when I‚Äôm in the office. I‚Äôm there to focus and work and leave asap so I can go paint and draw for art clients.

For context: I am a recovering people pleaser, I‚Äôm an  introvert and only open around people I‚Äôm comfortable with, I don‚Äôt enjoy being fake nice but I will if the situation is something I can‚Äôt get out of.. but generally I‚Äôm a kind person so I don‚Äôt like to go out of my way to hurt someone either. I also have a terrible abusive history with men so I feel a lot of pressure, even if this person isn‚Äôt trying to make me uncomfortable.. I feel like it‚Äôs very clear I‚Äôm not interested in him but he continues with the flirting.

At first,
I thought love was desperation and fire,
burning a hole through my chest so big
I wished I could crawl inside and hide forever.

Love was giving up every inch of myself
for someone else to use at will.
It was waiting, always waiting‚Äî
for the next fight, the next disappointment,
the next lonely night,
the next time they were home,
the next drink-filled evening,
the next time I had to run in fear.

Love was breadcrumbs of affection
to fill the gaping hole in my heart,
insults masked as truth,
being paraded before a crowd,
then cast aside in private.

Love was hard.
It was pain.
It was torture.
Love was not what I thought it was.

But you taught me otherwise‚Ä¶

Because love wasn‚Äôt any of those things at all.
No, love is the first rays of warmth
touching my skin as the sun rises to greet me,
the softest breeze across my face,
the sound of rain on grass,
the feeling between awake and asleep,
curled in bed, not ready to leave my dreams.

Love is the wonder of looking at the stars,
realizing we‚Äôre not so big after all,
the crackling of a fire,
curled up with a favorite book,
the first sip of coffee in the morning,
the sound of laughter in a home
filled with family and friends,
the first blooms of spring,
promising color and life in the weeks ahead.

Love is sweet.
It is understanding.
It is tender and warm.

There are many things that love is,
and it‚Äôs not what I thought,
because all along‚Äî

Love was you.",3,1730094483.0,Poem,0,1.0,False

Everything is Yuuta POV until saki diary epilogue.

saki has something bothering her but won't tell yuuta, but both mom and dad know. She asks if Yuuta will quit his job because of exam season and she says she'll do what he does. Yuuta says probably not, but he may take a leave of absence in November, and hopefully still have his position when he gets back. He also notes that depending what university he gets accepted to he may have to eventually to quit anyways if it's too far away.


at school Yoshida and Makihara are having a bit of a conflict, talking it out with maru/yuuta they said it's because they only go to her place to study buy Yoshida never invites her over cuz his family isn't all that well off and her shares his room with his brother. Yoshida doesn't tell her why he never invites her to his place and that's why she's upset. Yuuta realizes that sometimes the people within conflicts can't see the problem and it may take an outside opinion to get things moving (important for the end). Yuuta wonder if Saki concern with the bookstore is because she doesn't want to leave him with all that alone time with shiori/erina.


Yuuta and maru go home together for the first time a long while, since maru is longer involved with baseball activities. Maru asks if it's ok if Yuuta doesn't go home with Saki among other things. Yuuta says that she has her own friends as well. (Can't really remember what else they said). Some part of this conversation makes Yuuta realize that since his dad won't tell him why saki is kinda down, he has to ask Saki's mom. He rushes home before Akiko leaves for work. He arrives home as she is putting on her heels. Yuuta asks Akiko if he could tell the source of Saki's trouble and she eventually agrees but notes that he has to be careful on how he uses this information. It's a trump card he can't use it carelessly. It turns out Saki's real dad is coming over from Japan from America for a brief moment at the end of the month and he'll have a meeting with Saki.


Yuuta and asamura inform the bookstore manager of his plans. Erina pesters him for his line contact since she never registered it directly despite their group chat created for their barbeque outing. Yuuta eventually obliges, and saki seems a bit peeved. When they leave work Yuuta wants to help saki out somehow and proposes a date since it's been a while. Saki agrees, and they decide on a musuem.


It's a public museum that only costs 100 yen to enter. Honestly i skimmed most of of it. Some exhibit about a person moving a lot leads to a conversation about whether they would have to move if the university either of them get into is too far away from shibuya. There's another thing about family members finally reconciling after a very long time. But i was in a rush to get the hot spring action. At the end of the date, Yuuta proposes a study trip since Saki's studying has grinded to halt. They decide on a one night stay at a ryokan outside tokyo.


They tell their parents about their plans and Yuuta's dad eventually says he'll cover the cost of the stay and Yuuta/saki will cover transportation, and tells them to pay him back eventually. They get the ryokan, and quick get to studying. They study past noon so they ate lunch quite late. When taking with the proprietress of the ryokan about lunch and stuff, she suggests taking a walk around the outdoor garden. The two of them arrive at a bridge and they talk about when exactly they fell in love each other. Yuuta says the pool trip while saki can't pinpoint an exact time. Saki thanks Yuuta for pushing her to go this trip. After dinner the ryokan owners suggest they reserve session at the outdoor bath (mixed). Yuuta says he'll go in first and saki and go in after but is convinced they can go together if they stick to their own area of the bath. Saki does the leaning on shoulder illustration event in the bath, but nothing actually happens beyond that. They can't really fall asleep leading to a conversation about how they both think the other is a such a hard worker involving a headpatting session for Yuuta from saki before they doze off.

Yuuta wakes to Saki finishing up from a morning bath. He helps her dry her hair (other famous illustration). When they leave they go for a local ice cream (i guess important since the entire time yuuta is wonder if the saki he's looking at is the cheerful carefree saki from before her parent's split up or the current day stronghold saki. Back in the day Saki blurted out whatever she wanted all the time, ie ice cream). Eventually Saki spill the beans herself about the meeting with her Dad. Saki says she's worried if she's the same person as her dad, Yuuta consoles her to some extent. Yuuta says he want to go as well. Saki is grateful. 

They decide to both go to the meeting at 7am and a chain coffee shop. Yuuta goes in 5 minutes after saki and finds a place to eavesdrop. Saki's dad, Itou Fumiya arrives. The conversation goes nowhere. It's all about how amazing he thinks Saki is in term of look and smarts, and boasting about his new business and family in America. Wanting a buy a big house in the burbs with a massive dresser. Meanwhile Saki is just deflecting all the praise while just being courteous without saying much.

Yuuta can barely take the fact the conversion is going nowhere, her dad eating up the image of Saki's armaments isn't making her comfortable at all. More importantly they're never going to get to the heart of the issue. He sees Saki's dad as a reflection of himself back during the study camp when he was obsessed with being an accomplished person to be worthy of Saki and not seeing the big picture.

Yuuta decides to butt into the conversation much to Itou's displeasure. Yuuta doesn't really not what to say, but he knows the if he's gonna be an adult soon has to be able to talk to another adult as equals. He eventually just says, can you have a real conversation with Saki, to which itou is confused. This is enough of a catalyst for Saki to lay the wood on her dad. She emphasizes that her mom never love him because of his business success or hated him when it blew up. She says Itou coudn't handle being pitied even if that's not what her mom was doing. She says she doesn't at all about how successful he is now, and nor does her mom. She says she doesn't need his support even if she isn't completely confident with how well she will do exams/university and stuff. She's says just a normal girl that gets made fun of by her friend (maya).  She's ends the conversation telling him that she doesn't want to she him again. 

Saki leaves first but Yuuta finds her waiting him outside. Yuuta definitively says that saki is saki and not her dad no matter if half her genes come from him. They walk to school together talking about how big brother like Yuuta was being lately. To which he says he is a week older. Not wanting to lose, Saki runs ahead of him with a radiant smile.

1gdusot,https://i.redd.it/3hpg6cannfxd1.jpeg,The Boy With A Usually-Mispelled Name,"To The One I Want To Call Mine

""Passion Fruit Tea With Lime Soda, please.""

""Your name, Sir?""

Whenever we order our favorite coffee, milk tea, frappe, fruit juice, shake, slush or food, it's been a conventional thing nowadays to have our name written on the container. That way, other people would know that it's ours, not theirs and they would just step back.

I never wanted you to be one of those comsumable goods that I will just savour and devour merrily, and in a blink of an eye, you're gone. No. Never. I don't want you gone.

But somehow, I wish, like my only order at Fruitful, I can also write and plaster my usually-mispelled name on the part of your body where everyone could see it. I want to brand you mine. I want everyone to know that they cannot have you because somebody already owns you.

I know it's inevitable and I cannot grab someone's eyes in case he looks at you like you are some damn blue ocean - beautiful, calm, charming and inviting; because you actually are. And I cannot blame and stop guys from having a crush on you because, in case you forgot, I am fucking one of them. It's a truth I've come to hate as time passes by. It's a truth no one can question because of the clear evidences I indiscreetly write and post about on social media, chosen writing platforms and on a notebook I didn't even bother to hide from everyone's eyesight. It's a truth my history cannot deny because this is remarkably one of the highlights of my boring life.

As much as I know the fact that I'm so into you, the most heartbreaking part of this dilemma is the veracity that I never once crossed your mind as a boy who'd call you his. My name will never come out from your mouth as someone who reigns on your mind. You will never declare my name as the boy who owns your heart.

And so I sit here thinking about how this life is never fair. Yes, I've caressed your beautiful face with my palms but I can never be the last guy who can touch it. Yes, I've held those warm hands but I can never be the last guy who can lock them with mine. Yes, I've kissed those soft, irresistible lips but I can never be the last guy who can taste the heaven it brings. Yes, I've once lingered on your thoughts but I can never be the last guy you'd think about all the time. You live every day as if I don't exist in this universe while you became the life of my dormant world.

I know I've been through a lot of unfair situations since time immemorial and this is not the first time, but how come it feels like I've been denied with something I badly want? It feels like I've been declined to the biggest request I've ever made. It feels like I was never a good boy so I didn't see you under the Christmas tree. This is injustice! This is painful.

I guess this is going too long. Before I end this never-ending rants and write-ups, let me remind you of the late hours when I told you I am yours. Let me remind you that I still am even without your arms pulling me close.

Always,

We are both college students, and have been friends for a while. Unfortunately, I have learned just because someone is a nice friend, does not mean they are a nice roommate.

Riley is quite messy-- they will use paper towels, crumple them up, not put them in a trash can two feet away, leave garbage bags full of cat litter for days by the door before I decide to take it out, and let the dishes pile so high that they are at risk of falling onto the floor. More often than not, they leave personal items out in common spaces, including empty drink cans, discarded shoes and socks, an incredible amount of crumbs on all surfaces, and their weed stash. They like to empty out the contents of their backpack all over the countertop, leave used pots and pans out on the stove, and the unwashed dishes piling up with food still crusted to them gave us a gnat problem. (When we talked about this, they said that it probably came from my bananas that were still ripening on the counter.)

Personally, I am someone who really enjoys cleaning. I have even done it for friends and acquaintances for money before because I like seeing a place change from gross to pristine after a few hours of hard work and lots of scrubbing. However, I don't like seeing my hard work be undone in a matter of hours. As soon as I wipe down spills on the stovetop and coffee table, it feels like two more take its place. I am beheading a hydra of messiness.

In the past, I have asked if they could do a few chores and take care of things if they notice something needs cleaning up, like when the trash can is overflowing or the dishwasher needs to be emptied. They said okay, but I have seen very little evidence of this.

So I did what I always did and cleaned on my own. A VERY Deep clean. After that deep clean, any time I noticed that there was something to be done (trash, dishes, etc) that Riley did not take care of within two or more days, I would take care of it, then add a tally mark to a whiteboard on our fridge. Nothing huge or noticeable, just in the corner under where our grocery list is.

I am contemplating waiting a few days for the tallies to really rack up (it has been only four days now and we are already at 7) before I say anything to them. The reason I'm doing this because whenever I brought up chores to them in the past, they would make excuses, saying that they were really tired and just couldn't get around to it, or that they were ABOUT to do it, and then I swooped in and took care of it before they could (which I why I will be waiting now for these things to accumulate before I take care of them, just to give them some time to follow through.) I want some solid numbers to point to in order to show that I have been taking up most of the work here, and need them to help take care of our shared space. Part of me is afraid that this is kind of petty. So would this make me the asshole?",1,1730093204.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôm sure this has been covered many times, but through my searching of old posts couldn‚Äôt really find an answer. 

I‚Äôve had my Pixie for 8-9 years now, been running like a tank this whole time. I noticed last week a few shorter pours, about half (or a little less) of what I usually yield; as well as more liquid in the drip tray. When trying to descale, due to the larger amount of liquid flowing through I really saw that it was leaking from inside, above the tray. 

Did some research here, as well as watched a few videos on YouTube regarding disassembly. I figured it could be a gasket/o-ring, but from what I was seeing it was probably a clogged diffuser or spout. Coffee was coming out into the drip tray, not hot water, so I figured most likely there wasn‚Äôt not enough room for it to come out as intended and was backing up and leaking into the tray.

Not wanting to go straight to taking my machine apart, I used some pipe cleaners to go up the spout and clean it out. I also used a toothbrush to clean the diffuser. I ran a lot of pours with no pod, just to flush the residue and build up, and as it cleared out I saw that there was less water coming into the tray. Finally I ran a few with pods and all the coffee came out , with none leaking. Great!

I tried one more time to descale, but it started leaking again, and when I finished and ran a couple pods the same issue started all over again.

Apologies for the long preamble, but I was wondering if anyone had a similar issue and had any experience fixing it. I‚Äôm open to trying anything, whether it be disassembling, replacing parts/gaskets, or sending to Nespresso for a repair (if that‚Äôs even an option). 

Or should I just be thankful I got almost a decade out of it and purchase a new machine.

1gdunqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1gdunqu/entitled_roommate/,Entitled roommate. ,"Ive been living with my roommate for about 3 years now. Everything seemed promising at first, especially because me and roommate had a lot in common. Our birthdays are days apart and we even pursued the same major/career. I was excited to say the least. A few months go by and I realized she was beginning to show her not so cutesy side. Things like making snide comments about the space in the apartment or something she didn‚Äôt like, moving my things to replace them with hers, and never lifting a finger to clean anything, but complaining about literally everything. I am not a confrontational person, so I just bite my tongue and let things slide, even more so because I do not want to go through another uncomfortable cycle of finding yet, another roommate. A couple of weeks ago, I decided to do a deep clean of the apartment common areas like the kitchen and the living room. My roommate (who has never even offered to wipe the counters down) had decided she would go out for the day too so that gave me the time and space to clean. About 20 minutes into my cleaning spree, my roommate texted me and told me she was bringing her friends over. I told her it was fine, but that I was cleaning so the apartment wasn‚Äôt presentable. When she came home and walked in, she made a comment ‚Äúoh. Youre deep cleaning‚Äù and proceeded to say that she needed the dining table because her and her friend would be working on something. I moved all of my things aside so they would have space. A couple of minutes later she grabbed all her things and stormed out of the door. I texted her and asked her what was wrong and she never texted back. Next day, I was out all day so I hadnt seen her. When I came home that night i noticed she has made a clear divide on the counter top where she keeps her fruit basket and where I have a coffee bar. She scooted all of my things over and moved her things to the middle of the counter and made sure I saw that she placed pens in a way that would indicate if I moved everything over. This is just some of the pettiness that I have been enduring living with this person. Does anyone out there have any advice for me on dealing with this because I am soooo over it.

We have 3 children together. This past July, he had a stroke. While it was deemed by doctors to not have caused any significant damage, there have been some definite changes in him since it happened. He has become more emotional and depressed. He was already prone to both of those things before, but it has gotten more intense. To be honest, my husband and I were not in a great place before his stroke. But since it happened, things have been even more difficult between us. I have records of tense conversations between us. These were originally sent via text. I will try to provide context when necessary.

July 20 2024

**Husband:** I'm dealing with a life altering and potentially life-threatening condition, and your biggest concern is that I might spill some water at the coffee maker. I read you loud and clear. Thanks

\^ This was sent after I had asked him to be careful filling our coffee machine, as two mornings in a row I had woken up and gone into the kitchen to find water all over the counter and floor. His spilling the water was not related to his stroke, as he had done this multiple times before the stroke ever happened. I offered to fill the machine up for him before we went to bed at night so he wouldn't have to deal with it. I was annoyed during this exchange and I'm sure he could tell. His response to my annoyance was much angrier than normal, and he got quite a bit more upset than this text conveys.

July 26 2024

**Husband:**¬†Your lack of support and caring is astounding. I will focus on making it through the holidays and then we'll talk. Sorry I complicated your life by surviving my stroke.

**Me:** I was just trying to reach a compromise to stop all the fighting. You are scaring me and making me feel unsafe.

**Husband:**¬†Nice touch. Scaring you? Unsafe? Right. Nice touch. Make sure you put it in writing especially when you know you're wrong. You give zero compassion or support. That's a road you don't want to travel. I'm convalescent and I'm scaring you. Right. I'm going to bed. Goodnight

**Me:** I'm not joking. You are scaring me. You get so angry and you can't seem to control your temper even in front of the kids. I know you wouldn't do that normally.

**Husband:** What else did your lawyer tell you to write lol? I am tired and going to try and sleep. I'd appreciate it if you let me. It's amazing the concern you suddenly have for my wellbeing. Don't worry. The will hasn't changed. All this nonsense is not good for me right now

**Me:** There are no lawyers. There is no big plot against you. I am just trying to work this out. I am being serious with you. Your temper lately is scaring me. That is why l've been trying to find a way to keep the peace by talking things out. I wish you would please listen and stop be so suspicious. Anyway, I'm sorry if the compromise I proposed upset you.¬†Just forget it. I won‚Äôt bring it up again

\^ This conversation was the result of a discussion I had with my husband where I asked him to stop making sexual remarks towards me in front of our 3 kids. After the stroke, my husband became very sexually aggressive toward me. He would approach me for sex many times a day, putting his hands on me and making explicit remarks to me even after I asked him to stop. He would do it in front of our kids as well. It was making me so uncomfortable that I finally decided to talk to him about it. I told him that I would have sex with him when I was ready, and I wasn't ready yet. Things still felt too weird after the stroke and the stress and changes that happened as a result. He got enraged and called me all kinds of horrible things (bitch, c\*nt, slut, etc). He threatened to divorce me and told me I was a terrible wife. It scared me, so I told him that I would have sex with him if he promised to stop acting so inappropriately in front of our kids. He got angrier and angrier so I left the room. These messages were what followed that exchange.

August 11 2024

**Husband:** Yeah, well who you gonna get to take you???????????????????????????????

**Me:** What?

**Husband:** Explain to our son why I can't take him fishing. I'lI refer the builder to you. You got all the answers. I'm too feeble.

**Me:** You are going to make yourself sick if you keep getting this upset. Not driving is not the end of the world. You can still go fishing with your son.

**Husband:** Yeah, we'll walk there. AS a non-dirver, you hav e absolutely no iderad, and for 13 years my driving has been safe enough for you not to go get a license, So, first you took away sex, and now it's my ability to share experioences woth my family. WHAT A LOVING WIFE AND MOM!!!!!! Again you do the deal with housing your parents. I'm too senile to be trusted.

**Me:** You've threatened me with divorce and taking away my kids so I would have sex with you. I did. You refuse to wear condoms. So I went on birth control. I have done everything you have asked and you are still not happy. I would never bring my parents into this house while you behave this way. They deserve peace and quiet. You were a mentally unwell man before the stroke. Since the stroke you have been far worse, to the point of mania. I feel sorry for you. But I won't endanger my kids for anyone.

**Husband:** Go ahead. Have me examined. Anyone who doesn't give little \*name removed\*¬†her way is mentally ill and a brute. You didn't even bother to tell me you were concerned and wanted to talk. Instead you hand me an edict. Real loving wife. Mania: ""anyone who doesn't agree with \*name removed\*‚Äôs¬†unilatteral decision."" BTW YOUR KIDS ARE MY KIDS TOO.

**Me:** You drove through a red light at a crowded intersection. It could have killed our kids or someone else. But that isn't the only way you have shown you shouldn't be driving. You habitually tailgate cars often just to bully them into changing lanes so you can drive faster. You stop short at lights and intersections and almost rear end vehicles. You regularly cut people off in traffic. You accelerate when you see vehicles pulling out in front of you rather than slow down. You refuse to stop for pedestrians when they don't have the right of way because ""they should know to watch where they are going."" You are dangerous for me, the kids, yourself, and¬†everyone else on the road. And that is not the first time you have blown a red light. You have done it several times before. This was the most dangerous because you waited so late into the cycle of the light to accelerate and continue through the intersection.

**Husband:** I was in the middle of the intersection when the ambulance was coming the other way. I stopped in the middle to see if they were going to turn. They didn't but it left me hung up. Next time I wont worry about that and ignore emergency vehicles.

**Me:** You said that earlier. This is another thing that concerns me. You seem to be confusing events in your mind. The ambulance was earlier in the day. What happened when you ran that red light was this: you came to almost a full stop at the yellow light, then for some reason slammed on the accelerator and blew after it had already turned. There was no emergency vehicle anywhere around. The fact that you are still defending your actions and rewriting what happened in your own mind just to justify them is not great

**Husband:** I am not going to keep this up. I told you I was going to bed and you persisted on texting me. But I am the bad guy. Got it.

\^ This conversation followed the event I described in the above texts. I told him I wasn't comfortable with him driving us around anymore after he ran a red light. He got so upset, yelling and screaming until the kids were crying. He was yelling at the kids also. He told me that if I thought he was a bad husband and father, he'd show me how bad a husband and father he could really be. I interpreted this as a threat because it sure as hell sounded like one. I booked a taxi and left with the kids. It took days, but we eventually talked it out and the kids and I came back home.

August 12 2024

**Husband:** If I need to get a divorce and prove my driving ability to the court I will do so. There are so many places to go with the kids. And go there safely.

**Me:** Will you go to any lengths to get your way? It seems like the happiness and welfare of our family is secondary. You have told me that you would prefer divorce to us using a taxi service. You've also told me that you will cancel all of our credit cards and cut me off financially to prevent me from using taxis. You have said that you will refuse to allow the kids to leave the house unless you are the one driving them. These are not rational or loving solutions to this issue. I am sorry that you are so angry, but I only want to keep our kids safe.

**Husband:** I am sure. You present me with no options so you leave me no choice. I have a splitting headache and feel blindsided by this tonight. I love you and the kids very much and I would never do anything to hurt any of you. Put me in a home and and get it over with.

**Me:** I love you too. There are so many reasons the kids and I still¬†need you and want you with us. I hope you feel better. Please don't worry so much.

\^More texts about the issues with his driving.

October 2024

**Husband:** Sorry I am such a bother to you all. I will spend less time with you and will take care of all the holiday decorating myself. I give up.

**Me:**¬†I think you need to see a counselor or get some type of help with your mental state.¬†This melodrama every time you are faced with a challenge is not productive or healthy for any of us.

**Husband:** Maybe if you got griped at for everything you might change your attitude too. Maybe I should seek counseling? Maybe you should try being a little nicer...maybe sometimes when you're not wanting something. Marvelous life when the other person is always the problem isn't it.

\^Things had been going well, then he started back up again tonight. I am getting so sick of this. This was his response to me telling him that our daughter was scared to talk to him ever since the big outburst he had after running the red light. I was hoping to mend their relationship and ease her fears, but instead he blew up and stormed upstairs, swearing and slamming doors as he went. He sent these messages shortly after.

So AITAH? I genuinely don't know sometimes. I feel like it is a shitty thing to just up and leave someone who has just gone through a major medical event. But at the same time, he has demonstrated no desire to work on his anger issues or seek help in any way. He doesn't even acknowledge there is a problem and just blames everything on me and the kids.",3,1730092230.0,AITAH,18,1.0,False

She insists that she is the only one to do all the mothering when she is around, with no regards to how I feel about it. My husband goes over every Sunday morning for coffee and insists that i attend so they can see the baby. He used to just try to take our son even if I did not go, but I put my foot down because it messes up breastfeeding and I get stressed and a tad depressed being separated from my son. 

I still go occasionally because they are family afterall, but my mil becomes possessive over MY son. She immediately takes him away and usually goes to a separate part of the house. Most of the time she will not let anyone else hold him. She only gives him back when he's hungry but most of the time just tries to keep him. She won't even let me change my own sons diaper nor will she give him to me when he is crying. I hate this so much! I wish I would/could say something but there is a language barrier and sometimes I'm not sure if I'm just being dramatic or just cranky due to hormones so I remain silent. 

Today was another Sunday and I have been sick. Baby kept me up most of the night which was an excellent excuse for me to stay home. Husband surprised me by not even requesting that we attend and told me to get more sleep. Well, he was called later today by my mil who said that she was going to come over, as late at 10 pm, just to see the baby. Luckily, my family event saved me from having to endure the disrespect. I'm working on talking to my husband more about this so hopefully we can work on setting boundaries that make me comfortable. ",11,1730092206.0,JUSTNOMIL,7,0.87,False

1gdudtr,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommates/comments/1gdudtr/entitled_roommate/,Entitled roommate. ,"Ive been living with my roommate for about 3 years now. Everything seemed promising at first, especially because me and roommate had a lot in common. Our birthdays are days apart and we even pursued the same major/career. I was excited to say the least. A few months go by and I realized she was beginning to show her not so cutesy side. Things like making snide comments about the space in the apartment or something she didn‚Äôt like, moving my things to replace them with hers, and never lifting a finger to clean anything, but complaining about literally everything. I am not a confrontational person, so I just bite my tongue and let things slide, even more so because I do not want to go through another uncomfortable cycle of finding yet, another roommate. A couple of weeks ago, I decided to do a deep clean of the apartment common areas like the kitchen and the living room. My roommate (who has never even offered to wipe the counters down) had decided she would go out for the day too so that gave me the time and space to clean. About 20 minutes into my cleaning spree, my roommate texted me and told me she was bringing her friends over. I told her it was fine, but that I was cleaning so the apartment wasn‚Äôt presentable. When she came home and walked in, she made a comment ‚Äúoh. Youre deep cleaning‚Äù and proceeded to say that she needed the dining table because her and her friend would be working on something. I moved all of my things aside so they would have space. A couple of minutes later she grabbed all her things and stormed out of the door. I texted her and asked her what was wrong and she never texted back. Next day, I was out all day so I hadnt seen her. When I came home that night i noticed she has made a clear divide on the counter top where she keeps her fruit basket and where I have a coffee bar. She scooted all of my things over and moved her things to the middle of the counter and made sure I saw that she placed pens in a way that would indicate if I moved everything over. This is just some of the pettiness that I have been enduring living with this person. Does anyone out there have any advice for me on dealing with this because I am soooo over it.

1gdubt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1gdubt5/night_sweats_scalp_sweat_hot_flashes_but_not/,"Night Sweats, Scalp Sweat, Hot Flashes - But ""Not Peri-menopause"" - WTF is wrong with me?","Thought about posting this in the r/Hypothyroidism community but since this is likely a female hormone issue - I may get more ideas/info here about what could be happening to my body and where to go from here.

I am nearly 39 and have been struggling with hot flashes, night sweats, and excessive scalp sweating for two years. I have confirmed Hypothyroidism, however, those with Hypothyroidism typically run COLD because lower thyroid function = slower metabolism. I am the opposite. I get hot flashes and my scalp sweats at the drop of a hat. I am obese, however, I have been within the same weight range, give or take 50 pounds, for 20 years of my adult life. Needles to say, I more than used to being fat.

Both my PCP and gyno say I am NOT peri-menopausal because of my age. Granted they have NOT run a full hormone panel to confirm it. They both blame all of my health issues on my weight with NO evidence of it (i.e., no metabolic syndrome co-morbidity; my BP is normal depending on work-related stress; good cholesterol; good A1C; non-diabetic). They keep pushing bariatric surgery down my throat. I am a broken record in saying I am not interested in going under the knife until all biologial causes have been ruled out; I am not convinced it is a portion-control issue. I gained close to 50 pounds since my Hypothyroidism diagnosis 1 year ago while eating LESS calories and adding light exercise. My weight mysteriously keeps creeping up.

The worst part is probably the scalp sweating. Two years ago, it was like a switch flipped, and now my scalp sweats like a waterfall if there is no moving air on me. Yesterday I was at an outdoor work function in 60-degree weather, in the shade, and my hair was soaked within an hour. It is so embarrassing! üò≠ Luckily I had a wide cloth headband to hide my sweat-soaked hair. I now rarely leave the house unless required for work. I have all my groceries delivered. I don't want to be around people and be seen as the ""sweaty, smelly lady."" I have resisted the urge to buzz my hair off too many times to count. Scalp Botox has even crossed my mind but I cannot afford the upkeep.

Dr. Google says scalp sweating could be due to low vitamin D, however, my labs are all normal (CBC, A1C, glucose, Vit B, Vit D, ferritin, iron, cholesterol). I eat one large meal per day and intermediately fast on a 18/6 schedule. I drink at least 60 ounces daily of plain filtered water (no soda or coffee). I occasionally let myself have Earl Gray or Oolong tea. I have never smoked nor done drugs. I have not been sexually active for over six years and all STD/STI labs are all clean. My bowel movements are very regular (3x per day). I am about as straight edge and healthy on paper as you can get (sans my weight).

I think my doctors are wrong. I think the hot flashes, night sweats, scalp sweating, and weight gain are SYMPTOMS of a hormone issue. But you know doctors... they get stuck in a mindset of, ""if you are fat then it is your own fault.""  Even with my long recorded history of PCOS, I have never had a comprehensive hormone panel. I also share a lot of symptoms of Cushing's Syndrome (moon face, unexplained weight gain, weight mostly in my torso, unexplained bone loss, easy bruising, slow wound healing, etc.), but they won't test for it because I don't have a ""buffalo hump.""

So I guess my questions is where do I go from here? Do I shop around for a different doctor? Do I get a endocrinologist referral and demand a full hormone panel? What in the H-E-double-hockey-sticks could be going on with my body if it's allegedly not peri-menopause? If this is even a fraction of how bad full menopause will be, then I will have to move to Antarctica. üò≠

Thank you in advance for any insight or advice!!! <3

Info; Chronic Health Issues:

- PCOS; Diagnosed at 19 and started taking hormonal birth control to keep my periods in check. I was diagnosed at a healthy weight but I had PCOS symptoms as early as 14, when I was thin and athletic. I just had a hysteroscopy, polypectomy, and D&C about 3 months ago to stop 8 months of 24/7 bleeding, which made me severely bloated and anemic (anemia is fine now). My surgeon said the polyps were likely from taking estrogen birth control for close to 20 years. Now I have a Mirena IUD that has fully stopped my menstural cycles. My two biological sisters also have PCOS too but not certain which side of the family it comes from.

- Hidradenitis Suppuritiva; I am somewhere between Stages 1 and 2. Flare ups correlate with my menstural cycles although it has not improved much since the IUD has stopped my periods. I suspect this also runs in the family.

- Hypothyroidism (Non-Hashimotos); Diagnosed Fall 2023. TSH levels are now ""normal"" range with generic Levothyroxine. Runs on the paternal side of my family.

- Asthma; Well controlled with emergency inhaler; Only cardio and sub-zero wind chill will trigger it. Paternal grandmother had it too.

- Depression; diagnosed sometimes in my mid 20s due to childhood trauma. It is fairly well controlled thanks to therapy and a combo of Prozac/Wellbutrin that I have used for 8 years.",1,1730091381.0,Menopause,2,1.0,False

My surgeon says I need to drop 15 to 20 pounds before surgery so that's fun. I've lost three so far though so yay! Start of diet I was 283.

I'm allowed to choose from 2 protein shakes, 2 half cup nonfat cottage cheese, 2 6oz non fat, no sugar greek yogurt, and 2 snack cup of sugar free pudding for my 3 meals and 2 snacks. I can only have one of each of those for each meal and snack.

Unlimited freebies are: sugar free flavored water (Crystal Light, etc), sugar free jello snack packs, sugar free Popsicles, tea, black coffee, and broths with less than 160g sodium.

So far so good but omg it is ROUGH. I'm hungry ALL THE TIME. Will I get used to it and it won't be as hard?

Also, the chicken broth I got has only 60g of sodium in it and is GROSS. Does anyone have a better one they can recommend that has no more than 160g? It's the only savory choice I have and I NEED IT. Lol.

I'm taking it one day at a time. From my own tracking I'm taking in no more than 600 calories a day. I assume that's normal. I'm tired and a little discombobulated but that is improving.

I also haven't killed anyone, but I did make sure to warn everyone I love that I might get testy.

Anyway, any advice, help, or encouragement would be great.

""Good Morning Shreveport! Red River is showing more signs of life and its becoming sexier than usual. Marilyn Monroe and Brad Pitt types are more muscular out of the old red and we think its vitamins in the land and we want to tell you about the vitamins we recommend for yourself and your new lovers."" - Tim Johnson at KTBS reported while talking to his Co-reporter Kelly Benson.

""You know Tim, Older women like myself like to see a real man come out of a real tough situation. But what about dating a Man you don't have any historical record of no matter if his diet consists of vitamins and rock hard abs?""

The news was getting more ridiculous day by day since last year this time, October 30th 2029. I know you must be receiving this 2022-2024ish. I don't know how these things work with time travel, cloning and alternate universes with alternate internet connections (its a strange connection but stay with me, I think I am tapped in now). But I am going to try my best and not sound too wild, otherwise it might happen here too. It followed me last time, I think I got rid of it.

That News Report is the last broadcast I remember from my universe. Tim and Kelly were my favorite, wacky and fun. Local humor and perfect breakfast material. But you are not here to hear my day to day, however I am here to tell you something of a warning and its my fault. Forgive me.

Like I said the first report was October 2029, But before you ask...No I can not tell you who was president because Donald Trump, Obama and George Bush never were president in our history. I think the shift was in JFK because he was never even close to being in DALLAS that day in our history. The Twin Towers are still up in my world and we used major nuclear weapons 5 times in our past eliminating dangerous enemies (that was what I was taught, forgive me I will not go into detail we were different than you.) Our Technology is Nuclear and our most popular Music has been Bilingual for two-three decades (Spanish and English).

Enough about me, right? Right, well this is where I am going to start and if you get lost or feel like I am leaving something out because our cultures and life is different, forgive me. I will try to answer into further detail.

OCTOBER 2029, I was running some errands for my boss by the Red River. I was driving an eighteen wheeler logging truck. I was on the job for a year or so. The company I worked for used a bunch of equipment to transport from the river itself, the river in my world is three times as large and is a major trading post. It was about 0500 in the morning (my shift started at 0300 then ended at 1200),  it was my time to get off the logging truck and get to the docks and help the other guys load the rest of the trucks for the morning crew. We were busier than usual that month and I did not need any distractions. But distractions came and they came hard (no pun intended). At about 0520,  a bright light came from the river next to the dock we worked with the crane and rope. Out of the bright light were bodies, beautiful people that most of our of Spanish speaking crew thought were angels. Naked and now swimming, my friend and coworker Alex kept on exclaiming verbal utters ""Santa Maria, Madre de Dios!"" and others whispered. The chattering quieted as they walked to us and asked us to clothe them. Myself and D'andre (an older black gentleman that has been my mentor and one of the bosses favorites) tried asking the three women where they came from. D'andre and I were not convinced in magic or miracles. The women were silent for many minutes, as if they could not commute with us out of sin or authority. So we called the police and the boss (Hector Alba). The police could barely understand them, like us. The ""Angels"" sounded like they had a German and British Accent, it was strange but alluring.

At about 0645, the morning trucking crew had just started coming in to see the sight of now clothed yet shivering angelic women leaving with the police. It was all over the news, theories of this and that. It was not hidden and it could not be even if anyone tried.

""Traversed here-there and compelled to believe I could understand where I am and where I was is a simple way to put it."" -Man in Purple and Red Suit

The next day was of course, Halloween. The first Man appeared, this time near the city next to the boardwalk and casinos. Dude was stark naked and freaked out some little old ladies walking their dogs at about 7 in the morning. Our Shreveport doesn't have a bunch of crime like yours, its nothing to brag about. Some other travelers blame it on certain events in history. I don't like to compare histories because it is very controversial for your understanding and my goal is not to offend anyone or make you get distracted for what is happening.

The Man in Purple and Red was named Jerry or Jerrick or something. But for memory's sake I am going to call the guy ""Jay"". Jay was on the news not but 24 hours later. It was early November and I was just cleaning about an egging/toilet papering of my elderly neighbors home on my day off. It always happened to her yard around this holiday because she looked like a witch and had a few black cats. However she was the best and sweetest little lady I have ever known, mother 13 children and raised 21. Everyone of her kids visited her for thanksgiving, Christmas and her birthday (but that was only it really). Agatha was her name and she carried her GreenGlass Floating Tablet everywhere with her (she loved the news and gossip). As she was watching the translucent GreenGlass she looked through it asking me if I could rake the leaves while I was at it, I did of course because she deserves more love than any little old lady in this neighborhood of ours.

I got done cleaning up, to only show up on Agatha's Kitchen table. Which was tradition for the last twelve years I have been here. Hot Coffee whispered on the percolator, eggs fried with bacon and toast aside in a slow cook in the toaster oven. All this breakfast food was prepared as she stared through the GreenGlass adding seasoning and following side instructions for a certain omelette recipe she also had on the side. The voice thru the GreenGlass tablet however was the interviewer asking Jay if he celebrated Halloween and what he was doing for the holidays. A few minutes past, Carefully but with precision Agatha set our breakfast before us. Through the GreenGlass we discussed the topic... I miss Agatha, I miss those moments more than ever now. I wonder who will clean up the eggs and toilet paper.

Then it was the Middle of November, I was at work again. Same Docks, Around the Same time and about the same crew I was working with before. But this time when the bright light appeared, my coworkers did not shout religious gold and excitement. 12 men and 3 women came from the light, all butt naked. Different shapes, colors and sizes and not nearly as good looking as the angelic women or Jay the dog park flasher (which was his nickname by the crew). All the men were military like and the women were the same, muscles and built like bodybuilders on the juice. This time though, we had a military presence ourselves. I guess when the angelic women had many interviews they explained that there would be more people ""passing thru or flashing thru"". Each one of the three were stunning and interesting, they made world news wild and conflicting. It was all very distracting for me and I was not someone who enjoyed the reality they were explaining or where they came from, I was annoyed that there was an alternate universe ruled by the English, Germans, Spanish, and Chinese with a space age race for inter-dimensional travel . But that is why I do not explain where I am from either, it is annoying to know how things can work out in favor and against favor towards your beliefs and rights. So I ignored the beast at my doorstep until it was apparent I could not.

The military presence was increased over the last week. Each day brought new toys of destruction, a tank and many armor cars showed up the day before the 15 blinded us. A school bus with clothing racks showed up a few days prior, it was a rusty pink stranger danger color... it was parked between three jungle green jeeps. The crew and I called the bus ""Victim Meat"", the joke that made it that name was some dark humor about the military dressing drag (I forgot the joke but if I remember I might tell it). Jokes on us, the 15 skinny dippers were escorted to the bus and about the whole platoon except 1 jeep and a black SUV remained.

Now this is where things get weird, if they weren't already right? After this batch of swimmers, some men in black suits started asking us questions after each shift. I think it was the dudes from the SUV, FBI types/secret service. Questions were like ""Are you waiting at the docks for someone special?"" ""Do you know or want to know how they appear thru the light?"" ""What have you seen that you think we have not?"" ""Are you working with anyone near this area that can help us, help you?"" (I always thought that was one of the weirder questions.). I guess the government at the time did not want to intervene in a way that could make our newcomers feel unwelcome. Some part of me thought I was going to lose my job to some kid that wanted to play Dock and Crane. But I think the military and government had other things in mind.

December 12th, 2029. This is a date, I do not think I will forget. I was sure that the strange was just not a part of my life anymore. The river people (which was what the locals called the newcomers) were becoming less interesting day by day. They were big braggers and like to inform us how intelligent they were. Some of them even gave out advice on supplements, health, medicine and exercise routines. All great and dandy but not anything that really butters my toast and dips it in my coffee. In fact, that was the problem... I had run out of coffee that day and I was in a rush to get to work because I lived across town. I was on the bridge (which does not exist in your world, damn the sunrises and sunsets were bad ass on there...miss it.)

Anyways, I got distracted thinking about some things and that bridge. That day was crazy bright, I thought the lumber yard I worked at was on fire. I was stuck in traffic on the bridge, it was construction and now it was distraction. 58 people swam from the river to the dock shores, ""40 women absolutely heaven sent and 18 men that looked like they would steal your mothers and your daughters just by looks""(at least that is what a local podcast said about the event). Police and Military were short this time around, I could see from the bridge that I was not going to work today. I called the boss and he said ""I know, I am here and you missed it."" He poked and joked that I always miss the best ones when it comes to "" you should've been there"".

The world was interviewing everyone of them. Especially these five women from this group. Esther, Echo, Ivy, Reno and Emily. I think the group was called EERIE or some people called them the five most alive because they spoke out the most. All the ladies were scientists and engineers or both.y

I will be honest EERIE was something else, it was like your spice girls but smart and informative plus super dreamy. Anyways to keep it short and to not drag on. From then on out every two weeks 50-60 people would appear. Yes I'd still be required to go to work. The crew and I became kinda local legends, some people we normally regular at lunch or after work would joke that we were inter-dimensional players and just trying to keep all the other worldly hotties to ourselves. I miss those kinds of jokes and laughs. It is really stupid to think about but I guess it plays into my heartache.

September 11th, 2030. I know this is an important day for you here. It is terrible that that has happened here. My instance is different, I met a girl three months ago and proposed to her that day. She was a sister triplet clone of Echo from EERIE, it's a weird gene thing and test tube baby thing (too syfy for me too). Anyways I totally fell in love like a total tool for her. I clothed her on her day of arrival and she spoke to me first and we just never stopped talking. I have clothed many people since, probably well over 200. If I had to guess the immigration is probably in the 2000s, so look at me clothing 10%. I did get a pay raise for this, do not ask me how. Life was looking up, I was definitely happy.

I think you know where this is going, If not let me make it as simple as I can. I am an easy man and I simply fell in love. She wanted to go back to her world and I was willing to find out how. Except the magic to make that happen and the people I got involved with had different ideas. I am here now. I am going to try to remember what was said. I need to get back. Maybe there is clues, maybe you can help me. If its with her or going home. I don't know anymore, I don't want to ramble. I got to go though, I have a new job. It gives me time to think about the conversations I've had. The things I had to do, the things we did, and the difference we thought we'd make. There is so much to unload.

I decided to stick with what I'm doing for now and try to see things from a different pov. ""you work with cool people. Just go with the flow."" That advice has gotten me through some very busy days. I also have taken liberties like making coffee for myself and one of the managers.

We had a busy weekend. Parties, big tables, lots of European people for some reason. People have been nice and generous. All in all, it's been very good. Tonight was one of those busy days. I'm working the floor by myself, I'm having trouble keeping up with all the people who are sitting down. On top of that, I have a party in the back to attend to. I tried to prepare by setting out plates, cups, pitchers of water and pop but they started coming in before I was totally ready for them. Highchairs, babies, oh my. I got them everything they needed but my stress level did not go down throughout the day.

9:30 rolls around. I have a LOT of cleaning to do on top of my closing schedule. Then this group of what looks like kids in their 20s come in. It's unclear if any of them speak English, but they want to sit down. I tell the manager that I'm not serving them. He says that technically we are supposed to. Here's the deal. The phone won't stop ringing. The Driver is begging me not to answer it. He's been driving all day long and is visibly upset. The teenager who works alone in the kitchen is likewise tired and stressed. Even the manager said ""you've got to be kidding me"" when I told him that group just walked in. The man is older than me, and has been sitting in a chair all day at the cutting table. He is clearly not feeling well. I tell him that if he wants to report me to Pizza Hut then he should do it.  The biggest smile broke across his face.

The 7 kids, 6 foreign guys, and one white girl, were sitting down having a good old time. Only two of them actually wanted food. I asked them if they wanted carry out. They said they wanted to eat there. They were clearly out having a good time, but after a day like this we were having none of their merrymaking. I brought the kitchen guy out with me, told them that we were closing, and if they weren't willing to take a carryout than they needed to go. To show goodwill, I even gave them some drinks in a to go cup. They were sad, but they weren't regulars. It's rude AF to show up that late, and from a business point of view, we weren't going to make more than 20$, and frankly groups of young people are terrible tippers, so I wasn't going to go out of my way to befriend them. We have lives. Pets, kids, wives. We close at 10? I told the manager that while I'm closing, service hours are ending at 9.

A few days before that, some dudes rolled in 5 mins before close and ordered 15 pizzas. No. I'm not doing it anymore, and if that makes me a bad waiter, then call me the heel of the service industry. Want to fire me? I've got nothing to lose here.

""Good Morning Shreveport! Red River is showing more signs of life and its becoming sexier than usual. Marilyn Monroe and Brad Pitt types are more muscular out of the old red and we think its vitamins in the land and we want to tell you about the vitamins we recommend for yourself and your new lovers."" - Tim Johnson at KTBS reported while talking to his Co-reporter Kelly Benson.

The news was getting more ridiculous day by day since last year this time, October 30th 2029. I know you must be receiving this 2022-2024ish. I don't know how these things work with time travel, cloning and alternate universes with alternate internet connections (its a strange connection but stay with me, I think I am tapped in now). But I am going to try my best and not sound too wild, otherwise it might happen here too. It followed me last time, I think I got rid of it.

That News Report is the last broadcast I remember from my universe. Tim and Kelly were my favorite, wacky and fun. Local humor and perfect breakfast material. But you are not here to hear my day to day, however I am here to tell you something of a warning and its my fault. Forgive me.

Like I said the first report was October 2029, But before you ask...No I can not tell you who was president because Donald Trump, Obama and George Bush never were president in our history. I think the shift was in JFK because he was never even close to being in DALLAS that day in our history. The Twin Towers are still up in my world and we used major nuclear weapons 5 times in our past eliminating dangerous enemies (that was what I was taught, forgive me I will not go into detail we were different than you.) Our Technology is Nuclear and our most popular Music has been Bilingual for two-three decades (Spanish and English).

Enough about me, right? Right, well this is where I am going to start and if you get lost or feel like I am leaving something out because our cultures and life is different, forgive me. I will try to answer into further detail.

OCTOBER 2029, I was running some errands for my boss by the Red River. I was driving an eighteen wheeler logging truck. I was on the job for a year or so. The company I worked for used a bunch of equipment to transport from the river itself, the river in my world is three times as large and is a major trading post. It was about 0500 in the morning (my shift started at 0300 then ended at 1200),  it was my time to get off the logging truck and get to the docks and help the other guys load the rest of the trucks for the morning crew. We were busier than usual that month and I did not need any distractions. But distractions came and they came hard (no pun intended). At about 0520,  a bright light came from the river next to the dock we worked with the crane and rope. Out of the bright light were bodies, beautiful people that most of our of Spanish speaking crew thought were angels. Naked and now swimming, my friend and coworker Alex kept on exclaiming verbal utters ""Santa Maria, Madre de Dios!"" and others whispered. The chattering quieted as they walked to us and asked us to clothe them. Myself and D'andre (an older black gentleman that has been my mentor and one of the bosses favorites) tried asking the three women where they came from. D'andre and I were not convinced in magic or miracles. The women were silent for many minutes, as if they could not commute with us out of sin or authority. So we called the police and the boss (Hector Alba). The police could barely understand them, like us. The ""Angels"" sounded like they had a German and British Accent, it was strange but alluring.

At about 0645, the morning trucking crew had just started coming in to see the sight of now clothed yet shivering angelic women leaving with the police. It was all over the news, theories of this and that. It was not hidden and it could not be even if anyone tried.

""Traversed here-there and compelled to believe I could understand where I am and where I was is a simple way to put it."" -Man in Purple and Red Suit

The next day was of course, Halloween. The first Man appeared, this time near the city next to the boardwalk and casinos. Dude was stark naked and freaked out some little old ladies walking their dogs at about 7 in the morning. Our Shreveport doesn't have a bunch of crime like yours, its nothing to brag about. Some other travelers blame it on certain events in history. I don't like to compare histories because it is very controversial for your understanding and my goal is not to offend anyone or make you get distracted for what is happening.

The Man in Purple and Red was named Jerry or Jerrick or something. But for memory's sake I am going to call the guy ""Jay"". Jay was on the news not but 24 hours later. It was early November and I was just cleaning about an egging/toilet papering of my elderly neighbors home on my day off. It always happened to her yard around this holiday because she looked like a witch and had a few black cats. However she was the best and sweetest little lady I have ever known, mother 13 children and raised 21. Everyone of her kids visited her for thanksgiving, Christmas and her birthday (but that was only it really). Agatha was her name and she carried her GreenGlass Floating Tablet everywhere with her (she loved the news and gossip). As she was watching the translucent GreenGlass she looked through it asking me if I could rake the leaves while I was at it, I did of course because she deserves more love than any little old lady in this neighborhood of ours.

I got done cleaning up, to only show up on Agatha's Kitchen table. Which was tradition for the last twelve years I have been here. Hot Coffee whispered on the percolator, eggs fried with bacon and toast aside in a slow cook in the toaster oven. All this breakfast food was prepared as she stared through the GreenGlass adding seasoning and following side instructions for a certain omelette recipe she also had on the side. The voice thru the GreenGlass tablet however was the interviewer asking Jay if he celebrated Halloween and what he was doing for the holidays. A few minutes past, Carefully but with precision Agatha set our breakfast before us. Through the GreenGlass we discussed the topic... I miss Agatha, I miss those moments more than ever now. I wonder who will clean up the eggs and toilet paper.

Then it was the Middle of November, I was at work again. Same Docks, Around the Same time and about the same crew I was working with before. But this time when the bright light appeared, my coworkers did not shout religious gold and excitement. 12 men and 3 women came from the light, all butt naked. Different shapes, colors and sizes and not nearly as good looking as the angelic women or Jay the dog park flasher (which was his nickname by the crew). All the men were military like and the women were the same, muscles and built like bodybuilders on the juice. This time though, we had a military presence ourselves. I guess when the angelic women had many interviews they explained that there would be more people ""passing thru or flashing thru"". Each one of the three were stunning and interesting, they made world news wild and conflicting. It was all very distracting for me and I was not someone who enjoyed the reality they were explaining or where they came from, I was annoyed that there was an alternate universe ruled by the English, Germans, Spanish, and Chinese with a space age race for inter-dimensional travel . But that is why I do not explain where I am from either, it is annoying to know how things can work out in favor and against favor towards your beliefs and rights. So I ignored the beast at my doorstep until it was apparent I could not.

The military presence was increased over the last week. Each day brought new toys of destruction, a tank and many armor cars showed up the day before the 15 blinded us. A school bus with clothing racks showed up a few days prior, it was a rusty pink stranger danger color... it was parked between three jungle green jeeps. The crew and I called the bus ""Victim Meat"", the joke that made it that name was some dark humor about the military dressing drag (I forgot the joke but if I remember I might tell it). Jokes on us, the 15 skinny dippers were escorted to the bus and about the whole platoon except 1 jeep and a black SUV remained.

Now this is where things get weird, if they weren't already right? After this batch of swimmers, some men in black suits started asking us questions after each shift. I think it was the dudes from the SUV, FBI types/secret service. Questions were like ""Are you waiting at the docks for someone special?"" ""Do you know or want to know how they appear thru the light?"" ""What have you seen that you think we have not?"" ""Are you working with anyone near this area that can help us, help you?"" (I always thought that was one of the weirder questions.). I guess the government at the time did not want to intervene in a way that could make our newcomers feel unwelcome. Some part of me thought I was going to lose my job to some kid that wanted to play Dock and Crane. But I think the military and government had other things in mind.

December 12th, 2029. This is a date, I do not think I will forget. I was sure that the strange was just not a part of my life anymore. The river people (which was what the locals called the newcomers) were becoming less interesting day by day. They were big braggers and like to inform us how intelligent they were. Some of them even gave out advice on supplements, health, medicine and exercise routines. All great and dandy but not anything that really butters my toast and dips it in my coffee. In fact, that was the problem... I had run out of coffee that day and I was in a rush to get to work because I lived across town. I was on the bridge (which does not exist in your world, damn the sunrises and sunsets were bad ass on there...miss it.)

Anyways, I got distracted thinking about some things and that bridge. That day was crazy bright, I thought the lumber yard I worked at was on fire. I was stuck in traffic on the bridge, it was construction and now it was distraction. 58 people swam from the river to the dock shores, ""40 women absolutely heaven sent and 18 men that looked like they would steal your mothers and your daughters just by looks""(at least that is what a local podcast said about the event). Police and Military were short this time around, I could see from the bridge that I was not going to work today. I called the boss and he said ""I know, I am here and you missed it."" He poked and joked that I always miss the best ones when it comes to "" you should've been there"".

The world was interviewing everyone of them. Especially these five women from this group. Esther, Echo, Ivy, Reno and Emily. I think the group was called EERIE or some people called them the five most alive because they spoke out the most. All the ladies were scientists and engineers or both.y

I will be honest EERIE was something else, it was like your spice girls but smart and informative plus super dreamy. Anyways to keep it short and to not drag on. From then on out every two weeks 50-60 people would appear. Yes I'd still be required to go to work. The crew and I became kinda local legends, some people we normally regular at lunch or after work would joke that we were inter-dimensional players and just trying to keep all the other worldly hotties to ourselves. I miss those kinds of jokes and laughs. It is really stupid to think about but I guess it plays into my heartache.

September 11th, 2030. I know this is an important day for you here. It is terrible that that has happened here. My instance is different, I met a girl three months ago and proposed to her that day. She was a sister triplet clone of Echo from EERIE, it's a weird gene thing and test tube baby thing (too syfy for me too). Anyways I totally fell in love like a total tool for her. I clothed her on her day of arrival and she spoke to me first and we just never stopped talking. I have clothed many people since, probably well over 200. If I had to guess the immigration is probably in the 2000s, so look at me clothing 10%. I did get a pay raise for this, do not ask me how. Life was looking up, I was definitely happy.

I think you know where this is going, If not let me make it as simple as I can. I am an easy man and I simply fell in love. She wanted to go back to her world and I was willing to find out how. Except the magic to make that happen and the people I got involved with had different ideas. I am here now. I am going to try to remember what was said. I need to get back. Maybe there is clues, maybe you can help me. If its with her or going home. I don't know anymore, I don't want to ramble. I got to go though, I have a new job. It gives me time to think about the conversations I've had. The things I had to do, the things we did, and the difference we thought we'd make. There is so much to unload.

Choosing the right home [furnitures](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) plays a vital role in achieving a minimalist look. Every piece should not only contribute to a streamlined aesthetic but also be functional and timeless. Here‚Äôs how to pick the perfect furniture pieces to complement a minimalist home.

**1. Focus on Functionality Over Form**

In minimalist interiors, functionality reigns supreme. When selecting furnitures, prioritize items that serve a clear purpose without excess ornamentation. Opt for multifunctional pieces, such as a sleek coffee table that offers storage or a compact sofa with a pull-out bed. [Furniture stores](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) today offer a range of minimalist options that combine functionality with style, allowing you to maximize your space.

**2. Choose a Neutral Color Palette**

Neutral colors are foundational in minimalist design. They create a calming atmosphere and make spaces appear more open. When browsing furniture stores, look for pieces in shades like white, beige, gray, and soft earth tones. These colors help keep the space cohesive and are perfect for building a serene backdrop, allowing a few accent colors or natural materials to stand out.

**3. Prioritize High-Quality Materials**

Quality materials are crucial in minimalist design, as fewer items mean each piece must last. Look for solid wood, glass, and metal accents, which can withstand daily use while maintaining a timeless appeal. Natural textures also add warmth and depth to a minimalist room without disrupting the simplicity.

**4. Streamlined Silhouettes**

Minimalism embraces simplicity, so select [home furnitures](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) with clean lines and sleek silhouettes. Avoid overly decorative or bulky pieces, which can overwhelm the room. Opt for furniture that exudes simplicity and elegance, such as a low-profile sectional sofa, a round coffee table, or a rectangular dining table with simple chairs. Streamlined designs keep the room feeling spacious and airy.

**5. Consider the Size and Scale of Each Piece**

In a minimalist home, scale is everything. Carefully consider the size of each furniture piece relative to your room dimensions. Choose items that fit comfortably, allowing for ample negative space. This approach not only prevents overcrowding but also enhances the overall visual harmony. Furniture stores often carry a range of sizes, so take the time to measure and visualize how each piece will fit in your space.

**6. Incorporate Storage Solutions**

A clutter-free home is essential for minimalism, and the right storage solutions can make all the difference. Seek out furniture with hidden storage options, such as side tables with drawers, beds with built-in storage, or modular shelving units. Smart storage keeps surfaces clear and allows the room to maintain a polished, organized look.

**7. Use Accent Pieces Sparingly**

While minimalism avoids excess decor, a few well-chosen accents can add personality without disrupting simplicity. Consider adding a ceramic vase, a single piece of wall art, or a tasteful floor lamp to bring warmth to the room. Keep accent pieces minimal and cohesive with the overall theme.

**Finding Your Minimalist Furniture**

Choosing the right pieces for a minimalist home is about balance, quality, and intentionality. Many furniture stores cater to minimalist tastes, offering an array of home furnitures designed for simplicity and functionality. When shopping, remember that each piece should enhance the space while reflecting the essence of minimalism: ‚Äúless is more.‚Äù",1,1730090019.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

üèïÔ∏èüç≥ River and Woods

Such a cool interior and backyard‚Äîsuper cozy, but the food and service aren‚Äôt quite there.

üåØüë®üèº‚Äçüåæ Tierra y Fuego

This place was so amazing. Pre-COVID, when this place operated on their farm, it was delicious and such a fun spot environmentally. When he moved to a brick and mortar something changed. The food is still good, but it‚Äôs never busy, hours are hard to keep track of.

üå≤‚òïÔ∏è Alpine Modern Chautauqua

A beautiful building, inside and out, but the food and pastries don‚Äôt come close to Dry Storage, Boxcar, or Beleza.

‚òïÔ∏èü™¥Beleza

The owner clearly cares about making good coffee and offering delicious pastries, but they aren‚Äôt fond of laptops. There are frequent mentions and little signs all over the place about the limited time you can stay at the cafe‚Äîit really throws off the vibe.

The interior is fantastic‚Äîmodern New Mexico aesthetic‚Äîbut the food is pretty mediocre compared to other Mexican options in town, in my opinion. The breakfast burritos are pretty good, though!

1gdtuvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1gdtuvq/so_this_is_what_a_date_should_feel_like/,so this is what a date should feel like,"out of the 10+ dates i‚Äôve been on in the last year since ending my 3 year LDR none of them ever made me feel this good.

So this girl and I (who has the most beautiful name and everyone i talk to about her comments on it) matched on hinge a little over a week ago. We were really just snapping back and forth at first, nothing crazy, and then one night she starts texting me.

We started texting and conversing pretty frequently but nothing crazy. We talked about how we should do something sometime and she asked me to coffee with her. I said I‚Äôd love to and she told me Sunday. Later in the week my best friend and I decided we would go out Friday night and since I had a date planned with this girl already I decided to invite her out with us. She came. 

She was so sweet and kind and gentle the whole night and she really just made me feel so comfortable with her. I was very sleepy and a little drunk basically the whole night and the night before (Thursday) while we were talking we spoke about our love languages and I told her mine was touch. She proceeded to let me just cuddle into for that whole night and did not drop my hand at all. She got to interact with my friends and they all loved her which was the first super green flag.

At the end of the night when she was meeting up with her friends my best friend and I just talked to them for a little while and waited on their uber with them. She and I just cuddle up to each other and she held me the whole time until she left. Apparently my best friend saw one of her friends take a photo of us which i think is funny. 

The next day I had work and it was a shift with annoying hours. Since it‚Äôs a campus job, Saturdays are insanely slow. I told her I was bored at work and she didn‚Äôt acknowledge that until she walked in and surprised me. I wasn‚Äôt expecting her but it was maybe the sweetest gesture I‚Äôve ever received.

Today (Sunday) the original date day we started with a coffee date. The coffee shop closed which would be the normal time for a date to end but it didn‚Äôt. Instead we went on a walk. We walked into a tattoo shop and she got one right then and there. After that we just kept walking and walking around campus. 

I showed her my major‚Äôs school and she was almost amazed by it. Then we just kept walking and talking. We eventually sat down and just talked until the sun went down. When I realized how dark it was getting I walked her back to her dorm and she sat with me while we waited for my uber and just kept talking.

My uber took a long time to get there and I apologized for it but she told me she ‚Äúloves‚Äù talking to me and she just didn‚Äôt want me getting home too late. We have plans to see each other again this upcoming week/weekend and I‚Äôve never felt better about someone. We both agreed that in terms of relationships neither of us like something casual but neither of us want to rush into anything either. 

Being around her genuinely feels so good and comfortable and I am just really excited to see what happens next.",2,1730089524.0,LesbianActually,0,1.0,False

Therefore I'm seeking salvation on Reddit.

As mentioned before, I've little to none experience whatsoever with Dungeons and Dragons or tabletop games. Thus I'm hoping to find a mentor who can indulge me with his/her knowledge and have the patience for me to learn the game thoroughly. 

I played DnD during lockdown for a short while but due to personal circumstances, unfortunately, I had to take a break from it. 

That being said, this might be useful to know: I'm a male, 30 years of age and living in Belgium so timezone CEST. 

I like doing sports, such as cycling and playing football. Playing video games such as Football Manager and League of Legends. And if I‚Äôm not doing either of them, I‚Äôd probably be somewhere in the city centre grabbing a coffee with some friends. 

Those friends would describe me as someone who‚Äôs easygoing, understanding and more the relaxed type of person.

What do I like about DnD? The role-play aspect of it, most definitely. The world building is something I enjoy as well. But the strategic, tactical, teamwork-ish combats are fun too. I‚Äôd say in that order goes my preferences. 

In terms of availability: I‚Äôm free on weekdays in the evening and/or Saturday.

So if you guys feel like taking on a new member in your group to play on a (bi-)weekly basis, hit me up! 

On a side note: if there are people from Antwerp, Belgium who play this offline, hit me up as well.",2,1730089499.0,lfg,0,1.0,False
1gdtty3,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/1gdtty3/here_is_what_makes_my_symptoms_better_day_1_of/,Here is what makes my symptoms better. Day 1 of Covid.,"**Intro**: I thought I knew what pain was. I've had my wisdom teeth pulled out, I've had the air knocked out of me in martial arts class, I had an 'attempt' at a an IUD I almost threw up from. Alright, all those things sucked, but waking up in the middle of the night with the same pain I felt when the codeine wore off from the wisdom teeth? Yeah - imagine that feeling - only roaring in your very bones. 

**Symptoms**: Luckily, I've done some research, and also tried a few things that make this manageable. I went in to Urgent Care yesterday at 8 a.m. after staying up all night unable to sleep from what I thought was food poisoning or some kind of poisoning. A fever that won't go away, diarreah, dry cough, a terrible, the most terrible headache that was pounding and grew worse whenever I got up, moved, or ketp upright. 

Add to that nausea and inability to keep down solid food, and a really particularly bad pain in my kidneys? Let's just say I thought it was the flu when I got there. They tested me for both flu and Covid and - ding ding ding. I was the lucky winner. They also tested my blood for kidney function, tested my urine because it felt like I weren't peeing at all after the amount of liquids I drank - and when I did pee it would be a sudden urge that came on where I had to find a bathroom ASAP, but the results all came back normal except for behing dehydrated. Low sodium, low choride. 

**What the doc recommended:** Since the 2 tylenol and 2 ibuprofen I'd take together didn't do jack, he said I can double the dose if ibuprofen to 800 mgs every 8 hours. He also said that the antiviral drug he could prescribe wouldn't be worth the side effects, as I'm one of those people who constantly get side effects. He said that drug is much better for people with asthma which I don't have, basically to make sure they don't... well, die from Covid. I said okay and went home empty handed with advice of rest, water, mucinex, anti-cough meds, and the usual advice a doctor would give. 

**What I found out:** my symptoms were getting unbearable. The headache, the body aches. It was getting to a point of moaning aloud. All I could do was google, research what could help, and this is what I came across:

* [Pepcid, aka Famotidine study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35144974/#). Now I already have a bunch of stomach issues and last time I had a gastritis flare up, taking omeprazole days in a row gave me one hell of a headache. I thought Pepcid would do the same so I didn't take it. I also have histamine-intolerance or MCAS-like symptoms, though I never got positive testing for it. With a slew of food allergies, etc, Pepcid is not such a bad thing to take in my condition. It is an H-2 blocker, A histamine-type-2 blocker which means it blocks histamine in your stomach. Your stomach and producing stomach acid is linked to histamine, so blocking it makes less juice. On the other hand, omeprazole is a PPI - and it blocks the proton pumps from making the acid altogether. So Pepcid is a milder, safer version of Omeprazole, and doesn't screw you over for days at a time. Well, believe it or not, I first tried just 40 mgs, even though the study shows people did 80 mgs of pepcid 3 times a day. I felt slightly better, but when I took the other 40 - oh boy. Did it make a difference, particularly in body aches! That combined with Ibuprofen really, really helped.

* **Herbs and Teas**: My apologies, I do not have the links to the particular blends and types, but some of them I did out of sheer trial. First, making teas like Throat Coat and Immune Zoom (Basically, Ehinacea, Elderberry & other ingridients). And, in one instance what I really felt a difference from is brewing the SPring Dragon Longetivity tea. I don't know what the heck it is but it was recommended by my acupuncturist. It's pricey, potent, and for some reason has always given me a bit of a left-side pain, but oh boy. I would take that left side pain times 10 for the relief it brought me in my overall feelings. The thing is - after drinking it, my dry, gaggy, choking cough has suddenly turned into PRODUCTIVE cough. Yes, I'm finally coughing up mucus! It is a big relief not to have dry cough. 

* Apple Cider Vinegar - while unfortunately I could not find any credible studies on the effectivity of ACV in COVID other than the NCBI study that showed vinegar killed viruses (but in solutions, not inside humans), it has always been a thing recommended to me by my naturopath. You have to get the raw, unfiltered kind and add it to warm (never hot) liquids so the mother would survive. It made my extreme throat dryness bearable. I just wish I had some manuka honey on hand to add to it! Take a spoonfull diluted in warm tea every hour or two.

* [Quercetin ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9544774/)(& more!): This - works for me. In particular, when I combine Quercetin with Vitamin C and Zinc. The vitamin C and Zinc tip I got from [this ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/pd9xa3/what_supplements_to_take_to_prepare_for_or_battle/)reddit post, where the commentors were helpful enough to link a couple of credible sources. There are TONS of materials on how Vitamin C is now proven to help reduce the days you will be sick with both influenza and Covid, just google ""vitamin C and COVID Ncbi"" There's also studies that show that a large percentage of people who got COVID are deficient in vitamin D. I know I was on the cusp of insufficiency last month ago via blood test. Taking D with a fatty meal now.

* **Sleeping & drinking NOT JUST WATER**: So, I'm dehydrated right? Water, technically, can dehydrate you further by taking out vital electrolytes, flushing them out in pee. You need juice. You need broth. You need teas with ACV, lemon if you can have it, coconut water, anything. What I did find out, however, is that sugar and sugary things make me feel worse if it's an excess, but what I do to make water bearable is adding some sugary juice like cranberry cocktail, to my water. Just a splash helps it go down. Water by itself is very caustic to my throat. WARM liquids in particular are what make the throat better. Also - sleep on a MOUND of pillows. You have to be upright, at least 45 degrees, for your sinuses and post-nasal drip. Oh and keep a towel next to you. You will wake up with night sweats and you'll be chilly as heck at the same time. I soaked my bed last night in sweat. Ugh. 

* **Do not, do NOT skip antidepressants** or stimulants you are prescribed: I made the mistake of lowering my wellbutrin XL dose from 300 to 150 just on the day of. 300 makes me wake up early, and I wanted to sleep (And sleep I did, about 15 hours). However, the depression/withdrawals were 10 times the hell. I woke up crying in pain (woke up twice in my sleep with my body roaring sheer awful pain through bones. Left tit felt like it was being stabbed, there was an ice-pick migraine like someone was driving a spike through ONE spot on my skull, and overall, I felt paralyzed by pain). Now, I don't think that wellbutrin would have made pain better, but the mental status with which I handled it was poor indeed. 

* **Set an alarm for Ibuprofen during sleep**: 8 hours from then, if you can, set an alarm if your body aches are unbearable. This will save you the terrible wake up and agonizing wait for it to kick in in the middle of the night. 

* **Steam, steam, and more steam**. Humidify your sinuses. Take showers, epsom salt baths, do a nasal rinse (not neti pot, it won't go through haha, you need a squeezy bottle). Humidifier. 

* **Ricola** \- she's my life saver. I can't go to bed without sucking on it. Careful due to choking hazard for some of you, but for me, I just can't sleep without sucking on Ricola, my throat is too dry. 

* **Don't skip the coffee** \- if you already drink coffee, if your body expects it, don't skip it. Just drink the dang coffee. It doesn't make me feel worse, it makes me feel better. Just don't drink more or less than your usual amount.

* **Eat what you can** \- listen to your body. I tried forcing down chicken, it didn't go well. I did a liquid diet first day because the thought of food was nauseating. I then gradually added in apple sauce and yogurt. I can have rice crackers, but solid food doesn't make me feel great. Broth - had been excellent. Broth with toasted bread broken up into it to soften it I could keep down. 

* **Take it easy** \- I tried to do some chores. I tried to move around, I tried to clean my room. It knocked me out. Doing the simplest task, heck, going up and down the stairs, takes it all out of me. So conserve your energy, use it wisely on the essentials only, and relax in an upright position the rest of the time either in your bed or your coziest spot. 

That's it folks. I'm real interested to hear in what made YOU feel better personally, even if it doesn't have any studies backing it up. Please share!
