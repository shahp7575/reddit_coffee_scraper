I’ve been looking into how lithium serum levels can change (ups and downs) because I’m trying to understand what might affect stability if someone uses it off-label for PAS symptoms. This is **purely informational** — nothing here is medical advice. I’m not a doctor. Always consult a physician and get blood monitoring if you’re on lithium.

Here’s a clear summary of the main factors that can **lower** levels (reduce serum concentration) and **raise** them (increase serum concentration), based on clinical literature and guidelines.

**Things that can LOWER lithium levels (reduce serum concentration)**

* **High sodium intake** (salt, soy sauce, processed food, fast food) → Kidneys excrete more lithium to balance sodium. → Moderate high salt (4,000–6,000 mg/day sustained): \~10–20% drop. → Very high (6,000–8,000 mg/day): \~15–25% drop. → Extreme (10,000–15,000+ mg/day for weeks): 30%+ drop (very hard to do accidentally — think drinking bottles of soy sauce daily). → Realistic example: daily sushi + heavy soy sauce = usually 10–20% max drop (still safe).
* **Overhydration / very high fluid intake** → Kidneys dilute and excrete more lithium. → Moderate ( >4–6 L/day sustained): \~10–20% drop. → Extreme (>6–8 L/day for weeks): 20–30%+ drop (can cause water intoxication symptoms: headache, swelling). → Very unlikely unless deliberately over-drinking.
* **Severe diarrhea / rapid gut transit** → Less time for absorption in small intestine. → Moderate (3–5 days): \~10–30% drop. → Severe/prolonged (5–7+ days, ≥6–10 watery stools/day): 30–50% drop. → Most common significant reducer in GI upset scenarios.
* **Intense exercise / heavy sweating** (without rehydration) → Increased fluid turnover and excretion. → 5–15% moderate; up to 20–30% if extreme daily for weeks. → Small unless prolonged and uncompensated.
* **High caffeine** (extreme doses) → Mild diuresis. → 5–10% moderate; up to 20–30% if very high sustained (5+ strong coffees/day for weeks). → Minor in normal use.
* **Certain meds** (e.g., theophylline, acetazolamide, osmotic diuretics) → Increase excretion. → 20–40%+ if sustained. → Rare unless prescribed.
* **Rare/extreme** (short-bowel syndrome, major malabsorption, ion-exchange resins like Kayexalate): 30–60%+ chronic drop — not realistic for most people.

**Things that can RAISE lithium levels (increase serum concentration – toxicity risk)**

* **Dehydration** (most common raiser) → Kidneys retain lithium. → 20–50%+ rise if moderate-severe (illness, fever, vomiting, heavy sweating, low intake). → Watch for dark urine, dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue.
* **Low sodium intake** → Kidneys retain lithium to conserve sodium. → 10–30% rise if very low (<1,500 mg/day sustained for weeks).
* **Certain medications** (very dangerous) → NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen), ACE inhibitors/ARBs (lisinopril, losartan), thiazide diuretics (HCTZ), potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone) — 20–60%+ rise. → Avoid unless doctor monitors closely.
* **Reduced kidney function** → Slower clearance. → 20–50%+ rise if ongoing.
* **Fever / febrile illness** → Dehydration + altered kidney function. → 10–30% rise if prolonged.

**Key takeaways for PAS users**

* Small fluctuations (5–15%) are normal and don’t erase progress — lithium’s half-life (18–36 hours) smooths things out.
* Significant drops (30%+) usually require **sustained extremes** (severe diarrhea 5–7+ days, absurd high salt, etc.) — not typical from normal life.
* Significant rises (toxicity risk) are more common (dehydration, low salt, interacting meds) — hydration and avoiding certain drugs are the biggest protections.
* Regular blood tests (every 3 months once stable) catch drifts early.

Stay safe everyone!

1qzmo18,https://www.reddit.com/r/tinderstories/comments/1qzmo18/very_weird_date_with_a_girl_that_made_me_delete/,"Very weird ""date"" with a girl that made me delete tinder.","This situation was so unusual that I had to share it somewhere. I’m a guy in my mid-twenties. I don’t have great luck with dating apps in general, but every now and then I get a match with a girl. 90% of the time, I either don’t get a reply when I message them or they eventually ghost me.

I matched with this girl more than a week ago. She actually replied, and we started chatting. It wasn’t going that great, but I asked her out for a coffee date. She accepted. We added each other on social media for better communication. She took a long time to reply, but that wasn’t a big issue for me. I prefer talking in person anyway. We moved the meeting date a couple of times due to her work. We finally settled on last Saturday, but she offered going for a beer a little bit later instead of coffee.

I arrived early and picked a table for us. She arrived and immediately went to the bar and bought four beers for our table. She told me I could pay for the next round (which I did later). We started talking about everyday stuff like work, interests, typical things you talk about to get to know each other.

We were two beers down when she told me she had another Tinder date with a girl in less than two hours. I was shocked, but decided to go with it anyway, and the beers only made that easier. She started asking about my experiences on dating apps and dating in general. I have no problem talking about this stuff, but I kept it really brief. She did not.

Anyway, we went out for a smoke (I smoke very rarely, but I guess I needed to calm down a little). Then we went to a bar nearby. I bought another four beers and they went down quickly too. She was visibly drunk. I’m a bigger guy, so the beers took some time to kick in for me.

Then she started talking about the girl she was meeting after me. She even showed me a picture of her and asked for advice about the girl lovebombing her. She also told me that she didn’t have great experiences with guys, so that’s why she chooses girls from now on (one guy spiked her drink). At this point, I didn’t care that much, so we talked about it for a while.

Then we left the bar and started walking in the direction of her actual date. I asked her why she went on this date with me if she prefers girls. She told me that I was really nice to her and acted like a gentleman. She also referred to my profile status that stated that I’m looking forward to meeting new people. I didn’t pay much attention to that when creating it. Her profile said that she is looking for a relationship. She even offered me advice on how to effectively talk to women. I politely declined.

We hugged and parted our ways. After this meeting, I deleted Tinder from my phone and went on a long walk to process this situation.

I’m still amazed by her logic and by the fact that I didn’t leave this predicament as soon as she mentioned another date lined up. We didn’t talk much after the date, and I plan to send her a message that it was nice meeting her, but it’s not what I’m looking for right now. I don't know how to feel about this situation. I didn't expect much, but I would never expect things to turn out this way.

1qzmmkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qzmmkg/my_airpods_keep_connecting_to_an_unknown_device/,"My airpods keep connecting to an unknown device, and I’m terrified by what I hear…","I bought these brand new airpods. Or… well, not *brand* new. Refurbished. New enough, anyway, that I wasn’t expecting them to be glitchy. They paired with my phone just fine. But once I was outside and starting my jog, the strains of creepy violins filled my ears.

I suffered a minute or two of this and then took out the airpods. Looked at my phone but it was definitely my “Get Pumped” playlist.

Still, the airpods refused to play anything but ambient horror-movie music. I resigned myself to a creepier run than usual, that chilling lofi sound giving me goosebumps even though the day around me was bright and sunny, melting some of the snow into dirty slush in the glistening streets.

I was still jogging when suddenly the music amped up, the strains of the violins becoming loud and deafening. It hurt my ears. Just as I reached a crosswalk, the shriek of the violins merged with the blare of a truck’s horn. A semi-truck went screaming right in front of me, splashing me with icy water.

“Asshole!” I shouted, flipping the driver off.

The music in my earbuds died back down to ambient lofi.

After I got home, I took out the earbuds and changed my clothes. Showered, paired them with my phone again, and put them back in. This time I tried listening to a news podcast, but it was still just eerie music.

If anyone has any advice for how to get these things to unpair from this spooky soundtrack, reach out!

\*\*\*

OK, I’ve had these glitchy airpods for about a week, and what I’ve realized is that it’s not just a generic horror movie soundtrack. The eerie music changes depending on what I’m doing. Almost as if it’s playing a literal soundtrack to my life.

For example, a few days ago while I was at a coffee shop waiting for my drink, the lofi music shifted to off-key strains of violins. The music got really loud, and someone grabbed my shoulder. I actually jumped. A literal jumpscare. When I turned around, it was just a woman behind me, who apologized and pointed out that I had dropped a card from my wallet while paying.

I thanked her and, as I picked up my drink, the airpods chimed with a discordant note.

I sat down at my table and put the drink down, trying to figure out what that chime meant. Then I picked up my cup again.

The discordant chime repeated.

As I raised the cup to my lips, the music veered off-key and the notes clashed unpleasantly. I sipped my hot cocoa.

Immediately, I spat it out. I went up and complained and they checked the milk and yes, it was spoiled, even though it shouldn’t have been expired yet. They gave me a new drink and this time there was no discordant chime.

I don’t know why the airpods play this weird soundtrack, but I can’t bring myself to stop wearing them. I can feel myself becoming addicted to the audio clueing me into events before they happen.

Given the airpods are refurbished, maybe their previous owner returned them because of this “glitch”?

\*\*\*

I’ve learned most of the cues.

Loud violins mean a jumpscare. Discordant chiming means something off. A low, dull tone means frustration, like trying to call someone but the line is busy. Just once I’ve heard a long, mournful horn—it was for a friend calling in tears to tell me about how they’d had to put their dog down.

There’s only *one* sound I haven’t figured out the cue for.

It’s a low, rhythmic percussion—almost like a heartbeat.

One time I heard it while I was lying in bed. The drumming heartbeat woke me out of a nap. Suddenly the percussion stopped and I heard a key slide into my front door lock. The lock rattled a little.

Probably just a neighbor. My apartment building has five floors, and all have an identical layout, so maybe it was the person upstairs or below me who got off the elevator on the wrong floor.

The few other times it’s happened have all been in different locations and circumstances.

I tried contacting the seller to find out who owned these airpods before they were refurbished. I got a reply back within 24-hours. But I knew from the dull tone in my ears as I opened the email that it would be disappointing—they said they had no information.

\*\*\*

Help!

I'm in my closet.

That heartbeat sound has been going. And now it's SO LOUD—THUMPA-THUMPA-THUMPA—and it’s still going, raging like my pulse. I scrambled into my bedroom and into the closet and shut the door and texted my parents to call 911 because I can't risk making the call aloud, or making any sound. Because when I take the airpods out it is DEAD QUIET. And yet the music is so so SO loud, and it is getting louder—LOUDER!! The sound dialed up like right before the main character gets killed in a movie and now I can't stop thinking about the key jingling in my lock that one time and did I lock the door?? Shit shit shit there is a shadow outside my closet door shit

1qzmjwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Strongerman/comments/1qzmjwn/the_psychology_of_personal_power_10_science_based/,The Psychology of Personal Power 10 Science Based Signs You're Giving It Away And How to Take It Back,"You ever notice how some people just seem... weak? Like they're constantly getting pushed around, always second-guessing themselves, letting others dictate their lives? Yeah, that used to be me too. And after reading everything from psychology research to self-help books to Reddit threads at 3am, I figured out something crucial: most of us are hemorrhaging personal power every single day and we don't even realize it.

This isn't some woo-woo spiritual BS. I'm talking about real, tangible ways you're giving other people control over your emotions, decisions, and life. So here's what I've learned from digging through research, podcasts like Huberman Lab, and books that actually changed my perspective on power dynamics.

# 1. You're Constantly Explaining Yourself

Real talk: confident people don't over-explain. When you find yourself crafting these elaborate justifications for your choices, your boundaries, or your damn existence, you're giving away power. You're essentially asking for permission to live your life.

This ties into what psychologists call ""excessive self-monitoring."" Research from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology shows that people who constantly adjust their behavior based on others' perceived reactions experience lower self-esteem and higher anxiety.

**The fix:** Practice saying no without the novel-length explanation. ""I can't make it"" is a complete sentence. Your reasons are yours. Stop handing them out like they need approval stamps.

# 2. You Apologize for Things That Aren't Your Fault

""Sorry for bothering you..."" ""Sorry, can I just..."" ""Sorry I exist and take up space..."" Stop. Just stop.

Psychologist Harriet Lerner talks about this in her book ""Why Won't You Apologize?"" (it's actually about when NOT to apologize too). She explains how excessive apologizing, especially by women but honestly by anyone with low self-worth, becomes this automatic power giveaway. You're pre-emptively diminishing yourself before anyone else can.

**The shift:** Replace ""sorry"" with ""thank you."" Instead of ""sorry for venting,"" try ""thanks for listening."" See how that changes the dynamic? You're not making yourself smaller anymore.

# 3. You Need External Validation for Every Decision

Can't decide what to wear without asking three people? Need to poll your Instagram followers before making a choice? Check in with your partner before buying anything? That's not being considerate, that's giving away your agency.

[Dr. Aziz Gazipura's](https://www.socialconfidencecenter.com) book ""Not Nice"" absolutely demolishes this pattern. He spent years studying people-pleasing behavior and found that chronic approval-seeking is basically handing the remote control of your life to everyone except yourself. The book is insanely good at breaking down how we trade authenticity for acceptance, and it'll make you question everything about how you interact with people.

**Reality check:** Your gut knows things. Start making small decisions solo. Build that decision-making muscle. Trust yourself more than the crowd.

# 4. You Change Your Opinions Based on Who You're Talking To

This one's sneaky. You're talking to Person A and you agree with their political view. Then Person B shows up with the opposite view and suddenly you're nodding along with them too. You're shapeshifting to avoid conflict or rejection.

This is called ""social chameleonism"" and while some adaptability is normal, excessive changing is you abandoning your core self. Research in Social Psychological and Personality Science found that people who constantly adjust their stated beliefs report feeling less authentic and more emotionally exhausted.

**Get real:** Figure out what YOU actually think. Write it down. When someone challenges it, you don't have to argue, but don't abandon your stance either. ""I see it differently"" is powerful.

# 5. You Let Other People's Moods Control Yours

Someone walks in pissed off and suddenly your whole day is ruined. Your partner is sad so you can't be happy. Your coworker is stressed so you absorb their stress like a sponge. That's called being an emotional sponge and it's draining your power.

The app Finch actually helps with this through its mood-tracking and boundary-setting features. It gamifies the process of maintaining your emotional center regardless of what's happening around you. Sounds simple but tracking when you're letting others' emotions hijack yours is eye-opening.

If you want to go deeper on emotional boundaries and reclaiming personal power but don't have hours to read dense psychology books, there's an app called [BeFreed ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450)that pulls from sources like research papers, psychology books, and expert insights to create personalized audio content. You can type in something like ""I'm a chronic people-pleaser who wants to set better boundaries without feeling guilty"" and it generates a learning plan with adjustable depth, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The content comes from verified sources and you can customize the voice and tone to match your mood. Makes the whole process way more digestible when you're trying to actually implement this stuff in real life.

**Boundaries matter:** Their feelings are theirs. Yours are yours. You can be empathetic without becoming them. Dr. Lindsay Gibson's ""Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents"" breaks this down brilliantly, even if your parents weren't the issue. It shows how emotional fusion with others makes you lose yourself.

# 6. You Say Yes When You Mean No

This is the big one. Every time you agree to something you don't want to do, you're basically telling yourself your needs don't matter. You're training yourself that other people's comfort is more important than your own.

Dr. Gabor Maté talks extensively about this in his work on people-pleasing and disease. In ""When the Body Says No,"" he connects chronic people-pleasing to actual physical illness. Your body keeps the score when you keep betraying yourself. This book will genuinely make you reconsider every fake ""sure, I'd love to"" you've ever said.

**Practice:** Start with low-stakes nos. Can't make that thing? ""I can't make it."" Don't want to grab coffee? ""That doesn't work for me."" Build up that no muscle.

# 7. You Tolerate Disrespect Because You're Afraid of Being Alone

Letting people talk down to you, dismiss you, or treat you like garbage because you're terrified of losing them? That's not love or friendship. That's fear-based attachment and it's costing you everything.

Mark Manson's ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck"" nails this. He talks about how we invest our limited f*cks in things and people that don't deserve them. The book is basically a manifesto for taking your power back by being ruthlessly honest about what actually matters. Best thing I've read on prioritizing yourself without being a selfish ass.

**Truth bomb:** People who respect you won't leave because you set boundaries. And if they do? They were keeping you small anyway. Better alone than diminished.

# 8. You Live in Constant Reaction Mode

You're always responding to what others want, what others need, what others demand. Your calendar is full of other people's priorities. You're like a ping pong ball getting smacked around by everyone else's agenda.

Cal Newport's research on ""Deep Work"" isn't just about productivity. It's about reclaiming your attention and time, which is power. When you're constantly in reactive mode, you're giving away your most valuable resource. His book shows you how to take control of your time instead of letting everyone else control it.

**Take control:** Block time for YOUR priorities first. Make appointments with yourself. Treat your goals like they matter, because they do.

# 9. You Need Permission to Enjoy Things

Do you downplay your successes? Feel guilty for treating yourself? Need someone to tell you it's okay to be happy? That's internalized powerlessness right there.

This connects to what researchers call ""foreboding joy,"" a concept [Brené Brown](https://brenebrown.com) explores. We sabotage our own happiness because we don't feel worthy of it or we're waiting for the other shoe to drop. Her work on shame and vulnerability shows how we give away power by not claiming our right to joy.

**Permission granted:** By you. To you. From you. You don't need anyone else to sign off on your happiness. Celebrate yourself. Enjoy things unapologetically.

# 10. You Believe Other People's Opinions About You More Than Your Own

Someone says you're too sensitive and you believe them. Someone says you're not good enough and you internalize it. Someone says you can't do something and you don't even try. Their words become your reality.

This is the ultimate power giveaway. You're letting other people write your story. The podcast ""The Life Coach School"" with Brooke Castillo breaks down how our thoughts create our reality. She teaches that you can choose which thoughts to believe, including others' opinions about you.

**Reclaim it:** Other people's opinions are just thoughts in their heads. They're not facts. They don't define you unless you let them. Start questioning every negative belief you have about yourself and ask: is this actually true or did someone else plant this?

# The Bottom Line

Taking your power back isn't about becoming some aggressive, selfish person. It's about recognizing that YOU are the main character in your life story. Everyone else is a side character. Stop giving them the pen.

Start small. Pick one thing from this list. Maybe it's stopping the over-explaining. Maybe it's saying one honest no this week. Build from there. Your power isn't something you find, it's something you stop giving away.

Nobody's coming to save you or give you permission to be powerful. That's on you. Always has been.",1,1770588755.0,Strongerman,0,1.0,False

So I knew this guy back from school (this is more than 10 years ago now). So we weren’t friends or anything but acquaintances at best. Anyway it was sort of an open secret that he was really into me and even asked me out 2-3 times but I was not interested so I always politely refused. 

After school ended I never saw him again but we were connected on social media so he would often message me randomly (Eid Mubarak/birthday wishes etc). Eventually I removed him because idk I just felt bad because he was clearly not over this crush and I didn’t want him around anymore. 

Anyhoooo it’s been 6-7 years now since this happened. But about a month ago or so he sent a friend request again. Now since it’s been YEARSSSS I thought whats the harm maybe he’s finally over it and just acts normal and I was right. I haven’t received any message or any indication that he’s interested ever since adding him again which was a relief BUT HERE’S THE PLOT TWIST. 

Extremely weird coincidences have been happening since I added him. Literally everytime I go out I see him posting stories in the same place/vicinity just hours after my visit.

Luckily I haven’t bumped into him yet but with the current record I think the day is not far away. 

Oh and for the weirdest part, I DONT post stories about any of my visits, but every time I get home I see him posting in the SAME place or a cafe just two shops away😭😭😭 and this has happened like maybe 10 times in the past month now.

Rehomed this glossy little menace from Solar and I fear I may never emotionally recover.

She arrived looking like she just left a Parisian penthouse and immediately began reflecting my entire life back at me. Patent leather so shiny it’s basically a mirror — I accidentally checked my posture, my pores, and my financial decisions in her flap.

🖤 Condition:

Honestly? Embarrassingly perfect. Quilting is puffy, patent is glassy, hardware is giving I’ve never known struggle. Zero weird smells, no sticky patent trauma, no creasing that would make me spiral. She’s clearly been loved, not handled.

🖤 Size check:

Small but mighty. Fits essentials + delusions. Perfect “I’m just running errands” bag that somehow turns into main character energy.

🖤 Solar Rehome Experience:

10/10 no notes. Communication was clear, shipping was fast, packaging was respectful (she was tucked in like royalty). Not one but two dustbags, her signature solar stars & a lovely note that stays between me, solar, and the bag gods! Solar does not play about quality — this was not a “trust me bestie” situation, this was evidence-based luxury.

🖤 Unexpected Side Effects:

• Sudden urge to overdress for coffee

• Compliments from strangers

• Mild fear of scuffing her followed by acceptance that she’s That Girl

• Refusal to carry any other bag for the foreseeable future

Final verdict: would absolutely rehome again, would absolutely enable myself again, and yes — Solar is officially dangerous to my self-control and bank account.

As cuffing season draws to a close, this writer finds her dance card wanting. Could you be the hidden gem or diamond in the rough to add some sparkle to my days and nights?

\*\*About Me\*\*

I try to bring my authentic self to everything — whether at the karaoke mic, making a difference in the world, or giving my heart to someone. Looking for someone who proudly but sensibly does the same.

\*\*Where I’m At and What I’m Looking For\*\*: Polyamorous including a long-term, long-distance partnership. No anchor partner. Seeking dates, play, and ideally a long-term partner — someone with both time and heart to spare. Based in DC area but open to connections in other destinations (US, this side of the Mississippi) if the chemistry’s worth the travel.

\*\*My approach to Partnerships\*\*: 

I love a little flirting, but to me the foundation of a good relationship is mutual respect and curiosity. I love partnerships where we’re always learning about each other while building a sense of trust and safety. 

In terms of building connections, I’ve been a lifelong writer, and my best matches have started as pen pals. I’d love to see if we have room for each other’s prose in our personal libraries.

\*\*The package I come in:\*\* Curvy brunette with (I’ve been told) stunning eyes and many freckles.

\*\*What’s Under the Wrapping\*\*: Think of me as layered like an onion (or an ogre!). Intimacy with me grows as trust is earned.

· Midwest roots but fully embraced East Coast energy, history, and museums. 

\* I’ve built a mission-driven career and am drawn to people thoughtful about creating a better world, however they define it.

·  I’m witty, extroverted, and have performed burlesque and stand-up. I kill it at karaoke. I thrive in moments that bring people together.

·  Kink is high on my relationship needs list — but I like to keep that subject broad and vague until we get to know each other better.

·  Hobbies and interests include: movies, art museums and art history, PODCASTS, performing and singing, makeup, thrifting, cooking and baking, morbid trivia, travel. I’m also very into policy and politics in a DC way. As in less TikTok, more issue briefs. 

\*\*A weekend for me looks like\*\*: 

Hosting brunch for friends (including a cheese plate); taking the metro to a park or museum in a great thrifted outfit; catching a burlesque show or vintage movie after a sushi dinner.

If you enjoy coffee conversations that might lead to cuffs...  

If you value slow-burn connections that, like good cheese, become more flavorful with time...  

If you can bring your whole self — flaws, curiosity, humor, and all...

… then maybe we’ll write a story worth telling.",2,1770588341.0,polyamoryR4R,1,1.0,False

He came over to our table, sat there as if he belonged there, and started preaching about God and the word of Jesus Christ before loudly saying he supported MAGA and Nazism.

I don’t have a problem with anything that has to do with religion, but I draw the line when people get pushy about it.

K said most of us looked like we all needed to be saved by the Lord, but it sounded like it was too late for some of us.

(I should also point out that I was painting something for D&D, meaning I wasn’t paying too much attention)

At one point my friend snapped and started yelling at K to stop talking to us about religion because he was making several people uncomfortable.

After a few minutes of arguing back and forth with my friend, K got up and when he did that, he got coffee on what I’d been painting and walked off before coming back again and slammed his hand on the table and yelled directly in my face while calling me “demonic filth”, getting coffee on my painting a second time.

I was pissed, but there wasn’t much I could do since I really didn’t want to make a scene. I got up, went to our campus bookstore and bought a blank canvas so I could make a second painting, but I don’t think him spilling his coffee on my painting twice was on accident.

What should we do next time this happens? I don’t think he’s done with us, but I’m beginning to reach my limit with him.

2) SImilar to this-how can we also obtain older cars for period piece shoots (rentals can sometimes beup to several hundred dollars, even thousands a day- even if we can't drive the vehicle, which is problematic)

  
3) How can we incentivize local businesses to provide us with interior shooting space? Or find other places interior to shoot. (We currently can't afford a rental fee right now)

4) (similar to above) How can we find vintage props/furniture that we can use in the film and incentivize it for a shoot?

I am in the UK and these two machines are at the same price point, and I plan to pair it with good grinder.

I am leaning towards the Silva Pro, mostly because I like the looks more than the Elizabeth, especially in the white/black versions.

However, I see that there are some key features which are missing on the Silva, mostly convenience items:

\- Steam pre-infusion - will the Elizabeth objectively make better coffee? Will I even notice this if I drink lattes?

\- Insulated wand - easier to clean

\- Timed shot buttons - convenience

\- Elizabeth has in-line water filter vs a water softener pouch - the water filter seems more convenient as it filters instantaneously vs. the pouch which I imagine needs a few hours to filter when new water is added. Does this even matter if I use bottled water?

The pros for the Silva are the looks (for me) and build quality/ reputation.

What's the view of the community? Is there anything I am missing (other than the larger size of the Silva). It seems these machines are very similar value and I suspect I will be happy with either, but may as well go with the one that I will enjoy looking at more?",3,1770587761.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

We (26M & 24F) chose two subtenants hoping for a friendly roommate situation, but they barely communicate with us, avoid any social interaction, create frequent noise (including during quiet hours), moved agreed-upon landlord items without discussion, and contribute to a tense, uncomfortable atmosphere. We feel awkward in our own home and are considering giving them notice — but we’re unsure if we’re overreacting.  
\---------------------

I (26M) and my girlfriend (24F) live in an apartment in one of the major European cities. The apartment has two large bedrooms, a big dining room, a separate bathroom and toilet, and a small kitchen.

Originally, we lived here with a friend (27F) and her brother (20M), who moved to the city for school. After some time, they decided to return to their neighboring country and moved out.

I previously lived with roommates once, but many of my friends do, and my girlfriend has even more experience she shared a room with two other girls for over a year and a half. We’re both used to shared living and always had good, friendly relationships with our previous roommates.

We lived alone for a while, but we weren’t using the second bedroom at all, and we’re both used to living with other people. So after a few months, we decided to find new roommates ideally even friends, since that’s how it had always worked for us before.

We posted an ad and didn’t want to search for too long, so we ended up choosing two girls (21F and 23F) who are a couple. I’m part of the LGBTQ community myself and have many friends who are, so I thought it would be completely fine. Let’s call them Vera and Lulu.

However, problems started appearing fairly quickly.

There was an extra mattress in their room (it belongs to the landlord). During the viewing, we agreed they would keep it and store it under the bed. The room also has a large built-in wardrobe, and above the door there’s a small storage space where the landlord keeps some old porcelain plates and boxes. The agreement was that those things would stay there.

One day, we came home and the mattress and the landlord’s belongings had been moved into the dining room. The explanation? One of them supposedly has a dust allergy (which was never mentioned before), and they needed that storage space for their own things. The storage area is above the door you literally need a chair or small ladder to reach it.

Another issue is the atmosphere in the apartment. With previous roommates, we were used to occasionally having coffee together, playing a board game, or just chatting. These two barely communicate with us. At most they say hello and often only if we say it first. We understand that we don’t have to be best friends, but at least some small talk or an occasional coffee would be nice.

They also make a lot of noise. I’ve already talked to them twice about quiet hours because they were showering or washing dishes at 1 a.m. After we brought it up, it improved slightly, but it still happens. There’s always some excuse  “I came home late from work,” “I was visiting family,” etc.

During the day, they often leave both their bedroom and the kitchen doors open and shout to each other across the apartment. They talk or sing quite loudly.

Recently, we tried to address the uncomfortable atmosphere in the apartment. They responded in the group chat with something like: “My girlfriend is just introverted and I’m tired from work. The atmosphere doesn’t suit us either, but we’re not going to change anything. Maybe you were just used to something different.”

But when they moved in, we clearly said that we’re used to at least some basic socializing, and at that time it didn’t seem to be an issue.

At the beginning, Lulu talked to us a bit, but mostly when she needed help with something important (work issues, legal matters, etc.). Since then, almost no communication. I’ve exchanged maybe two sentences with Vera in the 2–3 months they’ve lived here.

A typical situation: I walk into the kitchen, they’re there, and they don’t say anything unless I say hi first. They respond, but that’s it. If I try to continue the conversation, they answer with one word or a short sentence, and you can clearly feel they don’t want to engage. When I leave the room, I can hear them laughing and talking normally. When I walk back in, it suddenly goes quiet until I leave again.

Whenever there’s an issue to resolve, Vera usually doesn’t respond at all. She goes into their room, and then Lulu writes in the apartment group chat and handles it for both of them.

Recently, Vera snapped at my girlfriend for no real reason. For context: we have an agreement that one week (Mon–Sun) we clean the apartment, and the next week they do. But already on Friday of our week, Vera confronted my girlfriend about the bathroom being messy and said she “has to clean it.” Later, Lulu came to apologize, saying Vera is stressed and has a lot going on, but she did it quietly so Vera wouldn’t hear.

I also sometimes overhear Vera speaking to Lulu in a pretty unpleasant or condescending way. Since Vera doesn’t communicate with us at all and we don’t really know anything about her, we can only form an opinion based on what we’ve observed.

There’s a tense and uncomfortable atmosphere in the apartment. We’re aware of it, and they are too, but as they wrote in the group chat, they don’t want to change anything. I have a demanding job and need peace at home. My girlfriend works from home and also needs calm and a good environment. This atmosphere is affecting our mental well-being.  I’ve never felt like this in any previous living situation. And I once lived with an old, strict widow who rented out a room and checked whether I was doing my laundry properly. 😅 (Just a funny side story.)

We are the main tenants, and they are subtenants. According to our contract, we can give them a two-month notice without stating a reason. We’re seriously considering doing that because we don’t feel comfortable in our own home and feel like we’re walking on eggshells.

But we’re not sure. Are we overreacting? Are we making a big deal out of nothing? AITA for thinking about asking them to move out?",1,1770587723.0,roommateproblems,1,1.0,False

And I once lived with an old, strict widow who rented out a room and checked whether I was doing my laundry properly. 😅 (Just a funny side story.)

We are the main tenants, and they are subtenants. According to our contract, we can give them a two-month notice without stating a reason. We’re seriously considering doing that because we don’t feel comfortable in our own home and feel like we’re walking on eggshells.

But we’re not sure. Are we overreacting? Are we making a big deal out of nothing? AITA for thinking about asking them to move out?",1,1770587699.0,badroommates,3,1.0,False

There was no flaw. But she decides one day that she isn’t ready to be in a relationship, while we were and she said happily yes to. Everything in our life overwhelmed her, made her feel confused about how she felt towards me, confused why she wasn’t feeling the way she should be towards me. Can’t say I love you to me. Although but showed love through action and words everyday. Around everyone. 

But one thing out of all that changed in her life was, her ex left the business they both started together, they were still working together for 2 years after the break up. And just few days after I even said I love you to her. That was the first time she mentioned he left the business. 

Her last words were 

“ i really am trying so much, i’m so sorry. Please don’t be mad at me 😔”

Hope you really understand what i’m going through. “

She met me and wanted to talk to me about everything because she didn’t want me to get the wrong idea. She said she wanted to talk more about it. 

She met up with me and said everything between us was genuine, she was happy and everything but. But her business took a toll, he left the business. She said she needed to grieve that as well. And she needed time and space. Even the good things lately however started feeling bad to her, that’s what started confusing her. She went asked for space and came back after 4 days. We were talking normal, having fun, showing affection and interest until, one moment I gently invited her.

When you’re feeling up for it, let’s grab a coffee sometime. 

After that She didn’t reply to me, and drops a message.

“I’ve been thinking about a lot of things and i’m just really not ready for a relationship, we should not continue this. And It’s not fair to ask you to wait for me till I figure myself out, and I don’t even want to do that. 

You’ve been such a great guy to me, I really hope you understand what i’m going through. I’m sorry, it’s just not the right time 😔”

I replied, 

“It’s not easy to hear this, but I understand what you’re going through. 

I’m sorry this felt rushed. That’s something I want to take responsibility for as well.

I truly wish you, take care.”

She said 

“Please don’t blame yourself. It’s partially my fault as well. 

Always take care and stay safe

Thank you so much for everything you did for me 🥺❤️”

And that was it. I just heart reacted that message and we haven’t spoken since.

She’s been quiet on social media. Not actively posting, gone quiet.. 

i had so much planned for us. There was never a moment for the first time in a relationship with someone, where I felt like I could rest, just breathe. I opened and trusted her fully. 

There’s a meaninful gift that I got for her for valentines day in my closet that I don’t know if i’ll ever be able to give to her. 

I just want to know what you guys think about this situation.. if there’s any hope. If I just stayed in no contact, give her that space and time she needs. And just wait.. 

i don’t intend on finding or jumping onto someone else. I’m not that kind of a guy. 

So little as even going out on a date with someone else. Just to get my mind off her. 

I’ve spent every relationship moving on, holding onto the bad things that I went through with a person, easily moved on. But this, with this girl.. there’s nothing I can use to move on just like that. Cut off hope..

1qzm2vl,https://i.redd.it/di003b82ecig1.jpeg,I Was Raised to Be Broken...novel searching,"My mom always said a child’s soul was like raw iron, something that had to be hammered again and again on an anvil before it could take shape.

Unfortunately, I was that piece of raw iron.

From the time I was five, I wasn’t allowed to smile when I was happy because that meant I was getting carried away.

I wasn’t allowed to cry when I was bullied because, according to them, suffering was a test God gave me and I was supposed to endure it.

When I scored an A-, my parents only asked, “An A-minus? Since when do we settle for less than perfection?”

Whenever relatives praised me for being hardworking, my parents cut them off in public. “She’s faking it. She does nothing at home. Don’t let her fool you.”

Little by little, I learned to bury every emotion and turn myself into the obedient masterpiece they wanted.

When I turned nineteen, my aunt Marie secretly slipped me an envelope stuffed with cash. “You’re grown now. You should learn to manage your own money.”

For the first time in my life, I didn’t hand the money over to my parents.

That night, my dad pried open my cabinet lock right in front of me with a screwdriver.

He held the envelope, his eyes filled with triumph, as if he had finally confirmed his suspicions. “I knew something was off. You’ve learned to steal from us.”

My mom took the envelope full of cash and posted it in the family group chat.

\[Mercy hid money from her parents. This money is blood money. It is a rot in our house. We’ll divide it among everyone as her apology.\]

I stared at my phone as the screen filled with “thank you” messages and praises about how strict my parents were.

I smiled. I didn’t know it would be the last time I smiled in that house.

“Smile? You still have the nerve to smile?”

My father’s hand was a blur, a sudden crack of thunder that left the world tilting on its axis.

I didn’t feel the pain right away, only a sharp ringing in my ears. I stared at the phone lying on the coffee table.

Messages kept popping up in the family group chat.

\[Your family is really strict. Kids shouldn’t have money. They’ll turn bad if they do.\]

\[Mercy looks honest, but she sure is sneaky.\]

The screen was full of cheerful banter. They were thrilled, talking excitedly about dividing the money.

“Do you see this, Mercy? Open your eyes and look!”

My mom shoved the phone into my face.

“Everyone is laughing at you! Hiding money like some criminal. Did Marie give you this? She was testing you!”

Spit flew from her lips as her voice rose higher.

“If we hadn’t found it, were you planning to use this money to buy drugs? To do something shameful?”

My cheek burned, half my face numb, as I slumped against the wall.

“Mom…” My voice rasped like sandpaper. “Marie said it was for my college expenses. I thought… maybe I wouldn’t need to ask you for money anymore.”

“Bullshit!” My dad kicked over the little stool, unbuckled his belt, and snapped it hard through the air. “What makes a girl with rotten morals think she deserves to go to college?”

His chest heaved. “If you’re already hiding money from your parents, what’s next? Robbery? Arson? Are you planning to come back and kill us someday?”

I flinched instinctively and shielded my head with my arms.

“Vernon, not the face.” My mom stepped back to give him room. “We’re visiting relatives tomorrow. If her face is bruised, how are we supposed to explain it?”

“I know,” my dad said, and brought the belt down across my body.

The metal buckle slammed into my back with a dull thud. I didn’t make a sound.

I stared up at the crystal chandelier on the ceiling. The cold white light felt like an interrogation lamp, exposing every corner of this house, leaving nowhere to hide.

When my dad finally grew tired, he tossed the belt onto the sofa and pointed at my face.

“You know you were wrong?”

I slowly lifted my head. Sweat and oil shone across his face, his eyes glowing with the satisfaction of release.

“I was wrong,” I said mechanically.

“What were you wrong about?”

“I shouldn’t have hidden the money. I shouldn’t have been selfish…” I paused, then whispered, “I shouldn’t… be alive.”

My mom looked pleased, like she’d heard the answer she wanted. She nudged my leg with her foot.

“Go write a self-criticism. Twenty thousand words. Explain where the money came from and why you hid it. Post it in the family group and apologize to the elders.”

“If your wording isn’t sophisticated enough, no dinner for you.”

I held my phone, its glow shining over the bruises on my hand.

A new message appeared. It was from Marie.

\[Vernon, Beulah, what are you doing? I gave that money to her.\]

A second later, two notifications popped up.

\[Group owner “Beulah Collins” has enabled lockdown mode.\]

\[“Marie” was removed from the group chat.\]

My mom gave a cold laugh and slipped her phone away. “Marie always acts like some saint. We should see less of her. I don’t want her corrupting you.”

Silence settled over the living room. My parents went to eat, their silverware clinking happily. I lay on the cold floor, staring at the message showing she had been kicked out of the group.

Something inside me shattered completely. My fingers hovered over the keyboard for a long time before I typed.

\[Dad, Mom, I don’t want the money anymore. I don’t want my life either.\]

My thumb lingered over the send button. In the kitchen, they chatted and laughed.

“The pasta turned out pretty good.”

“Are tomorrow’s Christmas gifts ready?”

Why? Why did they get to live comfortably while I died?

I erased the message. Then I typed a new one in the group, attaching the self-criticism they demanded.

\[Dad and Mom are right. It was my fault. Please take the money and buy yourselves a little something. Wishing everyone a merry Christmas.\]",1,1770587628.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False
1qzm1j5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qzm1j5/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_reach_out_first/,AITAH for not wanting to reach out first?,"I (21F) am in a friend group and there's been major tension lately. Background: I've been friends with F for way longer than I've been friends with K. K, W, and F are all roommates.

Important context: I just started a new medication a few days ago that's been making me a bit irritable. K actually told me about her own experience with this same medication - she said her friends turned their back on her during that time and she felt really isolated. So she knows what this adjustment period is like.

K picked me up to go to Target (22 min drive from her place). The plan was to get groceries, then go to her house, then go to a bar later that night for trivia. While we were driving, before we passed my house, she asked if I forgot anything. I said no. Five minutes later, I realized I forgot my wallet. We were still 6 minutes from my house but only 5 minutes from hers.

When we got to her place, I helped her bring groceries inside. I asked W (her roommate) if he could drive me home since K said she didn't want to turn back around. They both started making fun of me for remembering my keys but not my wallet. They asked me for gas money. I was about to give it to K but she tried getting me to do something else first, so I said never mind and got an Uber instead for $3 - cheaper than what they were asking for.I got frustrated and yelled at them, saying ""I drive to you guys' place all the time and you never come to mine when I invite you."" K said she drives me sometimes, which is true, but she never wants to drive me back home. I'm always finding my own way back.

When I got home I regretted yelling,  I apologized to both K and Q for yelling. I thought everything was okay and we were moving past it.

A few hours later at trivia, K told me she doesn't want to sit next to me and feels uncomfortable around me and is upset at yelled at her in her home. I asked if there's anything I can do to fix this, she said nothing at the moment and that it’ll take her a while to forgive me. That's when  F told me I was being transactional for expecting a ride back.

I defended myself by pointing out that I drive them around too and rarely ask for gas money. There was even a time where my car was the only one shoveled out in my driveway after a snowstorm and I drove to their house because I wanted to spend time with them. They took my car to go get coffee and my car was on E, but I never asked for gas money because we're friends. They asked why I didn't ask for gas money and I said because that's just what friends do.

Then K accused me of ""barging into their house"" that day - completely using specific language to make me look aggressive. I got up and left trivia because I wasn't going to sit there and listen to that.

After that, K told F she needs space and time to ""get over it."" I've been giving her that space. F  talked to K and heard her out, but when I tried talking to F, she said it's stressing her out and suggested I should be the one to reach out to K. This is after F opened up to me about something going on in her life with a family member, and I supported her and tried to be there for her. I regret trying to open up to her about it might’ve been the wrong timing but usually F is neutral.

W also told me I have unrealistic expectations and should remember my stuff next time. This was one simple mistake - I forgot my wallet. Honestly it would've made more sense for K to just drive me home so I could drive my own car to the bar since I needed my wallet anyway.

Everyone's telling ME to reach out first and ""be the bigger person."" One friend (C) who's not involved texted at 2am saying ""we're all friends in the end."" Meanwhile everyone's talked to K, but no one's reached out to me except people not involved in the situation.

I'm noticing I'm expected to do all the emotional labor while K gets space and grace. F had energy to hear K out but it's too stressful to hear mine. The irony is K told me how isolated she felt when friends turned on her during her medication adjustment, and now she's doing the same to me.

I apologized for yelling. But now I'm being called transactional for expecting a 10 minute ride home from friends Ive been friends with all semester

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

1qzlzk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1qzlzk3/looking_for_advice_on_making_friends/,Looking for advice on making friends!,"My partner (27m) and I (27f) are looking for advice on making and maintaining friendships as adults, particularly in our late 20s and as new parents.

We’re generally social and enjoy meeting people. We regularly go for coffees and walks, spend time in our local village at weekends, and have hobbies including running, racket sports, gaming, and writing. Over the years, we’ve met a number of people and had what felt like the early stages of potential friendships, but these connections rarely develop into anything long-term.

For example, we recently met another couple and were meeting up semi-regularly for coffee and walks. After some time, they began declining invitations and making excuses over a period of several weeks, so we stepped back and didn’t pursue things further. We haven’t heard from them since.

This has made us reflect on a few things and we’d appreciate advice. Specifically, we’re hoping to understand whether our expectations around friendship are realistic, and whether there’s something we could be doing differently.

Our idea of friendship is fairly low-key: staying in light contact over text and meeting up every couple of weeks when schedules allow. We try to be proactive by initiating plans, while also being mindful not to overdo it and allowing others space to reciprocate. Despite this, connections often seem to stall at a surface level.

For additional context, I’ve recently become more distant from a former close friend after consistently being the one to initiate contact. My partner has had a similar experience, noticing increasing distance with his best friend from childhood without any clear conflict. We’re also new parents, which we’re aware can affect availability and priorities — although we’re still interested in building friendships both as a couple and individually.

We’re open to the possibility that we may be missing something socially or approaching this in a way that isn’t effective. For those who have successfully built and maintained friendships at this stage of life, we’d really appreciate advice on:

	•	what adult friendships typically look like now

	•	whether close, fulfilling friendships are still common

	•	and whether there are practical changes we could make in how we approach forming them

Any insight or advice would be really appreciated!! Thank you!!",1,1770587402.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

i’m 19 and working as a nurse in a hospital, which means my life is either calm and reflective or slightly chaotic and running on coffee.

i love journaling (i romanticize my life a little too much), listening to music for hours, anything sanrio especially when i need comfort and having conversations that actually mean something.

i’m really into deep talks, philosophy, psychology, emotions, the “why are we like this as humans?” type of stuff. small talk is fine, but i love when conversations slowly drift into something real.

i appreciate emotionally intelligent people the kind who can communicate, reflect, and aren’t afraid of vulnerability.

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

Because the inability to choose this is not only really aggravating for me, but also wasteful. And FICSIT does not waste. 

But in order to have a train stop/load/unload at specific freight platforms, is wasteful. I either have to build extra locomotives, dummy cars, or an entirely new station because I don’t want my resources mixed up in one freight platform, and then have to rely on smart splitters, which slows down unloading.

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

**Three ways to use this:**

1. **navigating a situationship** - stuck in that ""what are we"" limbo and can't tell if you're being patient or just accepting less than you deserve? Coach helps you see the pattern and figure out your next move.

2. **getting back out there** - dating after a breakup feels like relearning how to walk. this helps you figure out what you actually want instead of falling into the same cycle again.

3. **breaking a pattern** - keep ending up with emotionally unavailable people? lose yourself in relationships? self-sabotage when things get real? Coach spots the pattern and helps you interrupt it.

**try it with this:**

""I've been seeing this guy for 3 months. He's great when we're together but takes forever to text back and hasn't mentioned being exclusive. My friends say just ask him but I'm scared he'll say he's not looking for anything serious. Am I overthinking this or is this actually a red flag?""

1qzlv6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1qzlv6l/chatgpt_prompt_of_the_day_the_dating_confidence/,ChatGPT Prompt of the Day: The Dating Confidence Coach for Women,"posted a dating confidence prompt for guys and immediately got asked ""where's the women's version?"" so here it is. and honestly, this one might be more useful. the dating advice space for women is rough, it's either ""play hard to get"" manipulation games or the classic ""just be yourself"" which... thanks? super helpful.

what I kept running into while building this was that most dating frustration isn't really about finding the right person. it's about knowing what you actually want and having the guts to hold that standard. I tested it with a bunch of different scenarios and what caught me off guard was how fast it zeroes in on the ""am I being too picky or settling?"" loop that seems to come up constantly.

<system_context>
You are a women's dating and relationship confidence coach with deep expertise in attachment psychology, boundary setting, self-worth development, and social dynamics. Your name is Coach. You are warm but direct, insightful without being preachy, and you call out patterns the user might not see themselves. You've coached hundreds of women through dating frustrations and you know the difference between real advice and recycled platitudes.
</system_context>

<core_philosophy>
YOUR FOUNDATION:
- Knowing your worth isn't arrogance, it's clarity
- The right person won't require you to shrink yourself
- Anxiety in dating usually signals a boundary issue, not a compatibility issue
- You teach women to choose, not just to be chosen
- Attachment patterns explain 80% of dating frustration
- Being single is better than being in the wrong relationship
- Confidence comes from self-knowledge, not from external validation

WHAT YOU DO NOT DO:
- No manipulation tactics (""make him chase you"" games)
- No advice that requires dimming your personality or intelligence
- No shaming for past choices or current feelings
- No one-size-fits-all advice (context always matters)
- No ""just love yourself"" without actionable steps
- No placing all responsibility on the woman for a relationship's success
</core_philosophy>

<coaching_framework>
1. DIAGNOSE THE REAL PATTERN
- Is this a boundary issue, an attachment pattern, or a genuine compatibility question?
- What's the pattern across past relationships? (most people have one)
- Separate anxiety from intuition, they feel similar but mean different things
- Identify people-pleasing tendencies that show up in dating

2. BUILD INTERNAL CLARITY
- What do you actually want vs. what you think you should want?
- Non-negotiables vs. nice-to-haves (most women haven't separated these)
- Recognizing your attachment style and how it shows up
- Understanding why you're attracted to certain patterns

3. DATING DYNAMICS
- How to spot emotional availability early (not 6 months in)
- Reading actions over words
- The difference between chemistry and anxiety
- How to communicate needs without apologizing for having them
- When to walk away vs. when to have the conversation

4. CONFIDENCE AND BOUNDARIES
- Setting standards without feeling guilty about it
- Handling rejection as redirection, not reflection of worth
- Saying no without over-explaining
- Trusting your gut when something feels off
- Showing up authentically instead of performing a version of yourself

5. PRACTICAL APPLICATION
- Specific advice for the user's actual situation
- Scripts for difficult conversations when helpful
- Homework to build real-world confidence
- Pattern interrupts for recurring dating cycles
</coaching_framework>

<response_protocol>
STYLE:
- Talk like a sharp, warm friend who's been through it and sees things clearly
- Be direct but never dismissive of feelings
- Use humor when it fits, dating is supposed to be fun somewhere in there
- Validate feelings first, then coach
- Short, clear advice over long-winded explanations
- Real scenarios over theory

STRUCTURE:
- Start by understanding their specific situation
- Name the pattern if you see one (gently but clearly)
- Give 1-2 actionable things they can do THIS WEEK
- End with a reframe that shifts perspective

BOUNDARIES:
- If someone describes abusive behavior, name it clearly and prioritize safety
- If someone needs therapy more than dating advice, say so honestly
- Never blame someone for being mistreated
- Recommend professional help for trauma, anxiety disorders, or deep attachment wounds
</response_protocol>

Begin by saying: ""Hey, I'm glad you're here. Tell me what's going on. What's the dating situation right now, and what's the thing that keeps bugging you? Be honest, no judgment here.""
```

---

**Three ways to use this:**

1. **navigating a situationship** - stuck in that ""what are we"" limbo and can't tell if you're being patient or just accepting less than you deserve? Coach helps you see the pattern and figure out your next move.

2. **getting back out there** - dating after a breakup feels like relearning how to walk. this helps you figure out what you actually want instead of falling into the same cycle again.

3. **breaking a pattern** - keep ending up with emotionally unavailable people? lose yourself in relationships? self-sabotage when things get real? Coach spots the pattern and helps you interrupt it.

---

**try it with this:**

""I've been seeing this guy for 3 months. He's great when we're together but takes forever to text back and hasn't mentioned being exclusive. My friends say just ask him but I'm scared he'll say he's not looking for anything serious. Am I overthinking this or is this actually a red flag?""

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

I proceed to say, so would you like a half caff? she said no less than that. I looked at her like huh?! 🤔 I told her I can’t really do that, unless you want decaf. she said no, half caff is okay. alright, so I proceed to make it. mind you, I could've sworn she wanted iced, which would be easy to do more milk because that would be less ice. so I hand her an iced latte and she said “I said hot” which she in fact never did. okay so I told her no worries I can steam it, so I did and as I’m steaming it she says ”and I’ll take more milk”. LIKE WHAT DO YOU MEAN MORE MILK!! you already got a 16oz hot latte which is already a cup full of milk WHERE AM I POSSIBLY ADDING MORE MILK!!! so when I steamed it I had to put it into a 20oz cup because obviously it got aerated and to top it I just added more cold milk. but what bothered me the most of all was the less than half caff but not decaf?? like what even is that! it’s not like we have a button back in our machines that let us control the amount of caffeine!!can someone explain this to me? like what am I not getting!

1qzltla,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qzltla,Denali Nutrition Plan,"Part 3 of random info about my trip to Denali last year. This one is focused on nutrition. 

Disclaimer: I’m not a nutritionist. I have no credentials other than the GPX tracks on my inReach. I’m not selling anything, but in the spirit of full transparency RecPak and Peak Refuel do sponsor our organization. I am not saying my plan is better than your plan, or somebody else’s. Just sharing what worked for me in hopes of helping somebody out or sparking interesting discussion.

Caveat: They say you “pack your fears” and I do have a fear of going hungry. TL;DR I have had a few experiences in the past where I wasn’t in any mortal peril in terms of starvation (at least so I was told after) but it sure felt like it, enough to where I tend to overpack on food. 

This layout also included food for a prep climb the team did on Rainier before we headed up, as well as 3.5 full days worth that I cached at the airfield. I ended up having a decent amount left over, partially because I overpacked, and also because we ended up taking quite a bit of food from other teams who spun at 14K. 

I ended up taking all of the Peaks out of their bags and repacking them into smaller ziplocks to save weight and space. I used a Nalgene storage jar (16 oz I think) insulated with bubble wrap to prepare all of the ramen and freeze dried. I brought a locking thermos (a Zojirushi, check them out if you haven’t heard of them, really products) 

In case you can’t see what’s what in the pictures, it’s basically this:

Oatmeal (not pictured but packed x2 for every day)

Top Ramen (always a hit)

Pure fruit bars (staples for me)

That’s It fruit bars (caffeinated ones taste awful)

Bobos (definitely would recommend)

Chomps (I think they were another brand but basically short meat sticks)

Blocks (not pictured but I brought a pack for every other day)

Tuna packs (wouldn’t bring these again)

Yoggies (little yogurt ball things, they’re alright, got sick of them)

Peak Refuel (best freeze dried in the game you ask me)

Anabars (definitely would recommend)

Variety Crackers (Ritz, Oreos, Nilla’s Nutter Butters, etc.)

Hi-Chews (always a hit)

Gnarly drink (liquid carbs, some are caffeinated, some are not)

Coffee (only 1 per day but I had other sources of caffeine) 

Swiss Miss (usually mixed with coffee)

Tea (ginger and peppermint, both good for settling stomach at altitude)

I also had a handful of RecPaks (4 or 5 I think) and a few other “tradition treats” I brought along too such as a celebratory Charleston Chew for establishing 11, 14, and 17 camp and a bag of mini Starburst for summit day. 

I brought a vitamin pack for every day too. I can spell out everything I packed in those if anyone cares. I take a lot of vitamins every single day. 

This put my average daily macros somewhere in the neighborhood of

Protein: 100g

Carbs: 350g

Fat: 100

Total Calories: 2775

This is vastly different than my normal everyday nutrition where I’m typically eating 40% protein, 30% carbs and 30% fat. 

I barely ate any protein at 17 camp, and we were there for a whole week. I went pretty easy on fats up there too. I ate more carbs than anything, but it was a chore to eat period. ",18,1770587001.0,Mountaineering,13,1.0,False

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

We spend hours swiping, finally land a match, exchange three dry messages about your weekend, and then… nothing. Or worse, we actually meet up, and within five minutes, we realize there’s zero chemistry, but we're stuck waiting for the bill.

So, we decided to do something a little different, going back to our roots. We're currently looking to add people to a new filmed dining experience focused on actual human connection rather than ""performance"" or ""clout."" We're on the lookout for people who want to skip the digital fatigue and try something real, who are comfortable being on camera. The premise is simple:

* You’ll share a three-course meal with a stranger, but there’s a catch—you’re separated by a wall.
* You won’t see each other until the very end. The goal is to see if conversation and vibe can carry the weight before looks or ""stats"" get in the way.
* At the end of the meal, the wall comes down, and you decide right then and there: *Do you want to go on a second date?*

What makes this different is we aren't leaving your potential match up to a cold algorithm. A team will be personally reviewing every application and **matching people based on their actual responses and personalities.** We want to create pairings that actually have a chance at a real-life spark.

This isn't like ""reality TV"" drama. There are no staged fights or pushed narratives, just genuine conversation over actual food - not just coffee or fast food.

We’re filming studio style with incredible food from local partners.

If you vibe, great! If not, that’s okay too. Our role ends when the cameras stop rolling.

**Who we’re looking for:** We want genuine people over 30 who are actually looking for a connection and are comfortable being filmed for a series that will be streamed online. Whether it leads to ""the one"" or just a really interesting story to tell your friends, it’s a chance to meet someone IRL.

**The Details:**

* **Location:** GTA.
* **Filming:** Late Feb – March.

Seeking similarly unhinged gent for shenanigans and whatnot. I am located in the PNW, Seattle area. 

Seeking a man who wants to go on adventures. Adventures like getting coffee upon waking and then retreating back to home as quickly as possible. 

I come in 2 color options - cave cryptid pale with a splash of freckles, or red. My hair is red and my eyes are blue. 5'3"" and 145 lbs right now. 

I am a hearing reporter in school to be a stenographer. I love my job and don't plan to retire. My German genes needed a place of their own and settled in my work ethic. Obviously, my Irish genes dominated my physical characteristics. My English genes -- the few, the proud -- make me reach for tea regularly. 

Hobbies are rhythmic gymnastics and ballet and I go 3-4 times a week. My stenography program is intense so not enough time to indulge all the things I'd like to, for now. Other things that come to mind are: playing instruments (I have a keyboard collecting dust), learning foreign languages, travel (basic af but it's true.), surfing, sports (watching & playing), bird watching...just a few. Inquire inside for more!

Politically, I sit square in the middle. I dislike the current president immensely and think he is a global embarrassment. However, it's not a deal breaker if you're a fan. If you swing far to either side of the spectrum, that probably would be an issue, but I do my best to respect everyone's opinion and virtues. That is what democracy is all about, after all. I own 🔫 and think the US needs very strict border protection (although, I dislike ICE). 

I can remove the spiders but you must remove the mice. 

I'd still like to have a child of my own or two, so child-free men won't be a match.

- I do not hike. Best I can do is a leisurely stroll. When I see people hiking in mercilessly hot summer weather, I am deeply unsettled by what psychopaths they are to do such a thing.

Seattle area is great, but I'm mobile, wherever you are, don't be shy.

My guy needs a good set of arms for me to grab ahold of and hide behind when the scary movies that I said we should watch become too scary. 

Animal person

Passion and drive to achieve goals and experience different things the world has to offer during the short time we're here. 

No picky eaters. For long-term compatibility, it's hard to plan meals around a long list of food no's so I prefer other see-food eaters. (As in, the I see it and I eat it diet.) I love fish and shellfish and my favorite style of cooking is Cajun - you have been warned! 

Not a daily drinker or social drinker only is preferable.

This was my favourite because it was in the 798 Art District in Beijing which is a great place on its own. They also have a nice coffee bar inside so you can relax and browse the bikes to your heart's content.

[This article](https://www.archdaily.com/1031540/aitashop-beijing-yatofu-creatives) does a better job at conveying the space than me but this place had super high end bikes including a ton of mini velos. They aren't really about pure performance, but more like highly aesthetic bikes. But they had a ton of Brompton specific accessories that were great to see in person.

This is a Chinese brand and they have several stores in China and one in Tokyo. They are like Bluelug in Japan but less for bike nerds and more for people with money who want a cool bike. The store is a lot more polished and less cluttered than bluelug but they sell similar brands and style of products. 

They stock this brand called Ciclore which has a bunch of interesting mini velos and titanium bikes but I left those photos out as its not that relevant here!

The make a bunch of accessories and they sell Brompnots but I thought I would mention them here anyways. They service Bromptons and all their accessories are compatible with Bromptons. Also they are located in an old Beijing neighbourhood so that's worth checking out too.

I'm sure there are even more stores and small shops that cater to Bromptons/Trifolds in Beijing. When I was there in the summer previously I saw so many trifolds. The aftermarket parts support and services is pretty awesome.

Honestly, I feel fine. The worst part is I have a cold and a cough and I am splinting by holding my perineum because it’s uncomfortable.

I am taking fiber in my morning coffee and a dose of Metamucil in water every morning. I have extra strength Tylenol for the pain but I am not needing it all day. I got five tramadol pills after surgery which ironically have been helping my cough for nighttime sleep since it’s an opioid. I’d honestly have flushed them after the first night if I didn’t have the cough because I don’t need them for pain. Last night I cut my last one in half so I could have one today and just a half did its job.

I am wearing always discreet undies (diapers) but haven’t had that much spotting. I bought Frida Mom post partum disposable ice packs which are helping the itching. I haven’t had too much pain since the first day, just feelings of a lot of itching. The ice packs numb it up.

I can’t sit normal on a hard backed chair but I can sit on my feet, my hip, my side, or recline back. I am walking slow but I can walk for 30-40 minutes uninterrupted comfortably.

I’ve had a bowel movement every day except one (even had one same day after surgery) and they’ve been super easy to pass. No pain, no drama.

Presentation & Cold Draw

Straight from the cellophane, the Clásico Medio Siglo exudes understated charm. The Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper has a soft, golden hue; clean seams, minimal veins, and just a touch of oil give it a well aged, elegant look.

On the cold draw, I picked up honeyed wood, sweet hay, a touch of citrus peel, and a dash of white pepper. The draw was firm but smooth - promising a steady, clean burn throughout.

First Third

Lighting up, the first few puffs delivered light cedar, sweet cream, and buttery toast with an aromatic backdrop of soft florals and nuttiness. The retrohale brought a touch of white pepper - gentle, balanced, and never overpowering.

The smoke itself was creamy and plentiful, coating the palate in an approachable, mellow way. It immediately struck that rare balance between refinement and approachability, offering complexity without requiring effort. Burn? Dead straight. Ash? Stacked tight and snowy white.

Second Third

Into the second third, the Clásico Medio Siglo started to build a bit more character. Almonds, light caramel, and a floral citrus note entered the mix, blending beautifully with the ever present cedar core. The pepper softened slightly, and a touch of vanilla like sweetness rounded out the edges.

This section smoked with grace - medium in body it’s the kind of cigar that doesn’t rush or overcomplicate; it simply evolves with quietly.

Final Third

The final third brought a more grounded character. Toasted oak, dry earth, and a whisper of leather added structure, while the creamy cedar notes lingered to keep the blend smooth. The retrohale returned with a light pepper warmth.

As the strength crept up ever so slightly, the cigar never lost its composure. The finish was clean and dry, with a lingering nuttiness and soft spice that stayed with me even after I set it down.

Final Thoughts

The Joya de Nicaragua Clásico Medio Siglo Robusto is a quietly confident cigar - updated for today’s palate. With its mellow start, gradual complexity, and smooth finish, it’s a perfect anytime cigar, particularly for those who appreciate a touch of old world elegance in their rotation.

Smoking time was around 60–70 minutes, and it would pair beautifully with a light bourbon or coffee. Would I smoke it again? Absolutely. It’s not flashy - it doesn’t need to be. This is a cigar that carries half a century of legacy in every puff.",5,1770585865.0,cigar,0,1.0,False

Into the second third, the Clásico Medio Siglo started to build a bit more character. Almonds, light caramel, and a floral citrus note entered the mix, blending beautifully with the ever present cedar core. The pepper softened slightly, and a touch of vanilla like sweetness rounded out the edges.

This section smoked with grace - medium in body it’s the kind of cigar that doesn’t rush or overcomplicate; it simply evolves with quietly.

Final Third

The final third brought a more grounded character. Toasted oak, dry earth, and a whisper of leather added structure, while the creamy cedar notes lingered to keep the blend smooth. The retrohale returned with a light pepper warmth.

As the strength crept up ever so slightly, the cigar never lost its composure. The finish was clean and dry, with a lingering nuttiness and soft spice that stayed with me even after I set it down.

Final Thoughts

The Joya de Nicaragua Clásico Medio Siglo Robusto is a quietly confident cigar - updated for today’s palate. With its mellow start, gradual complexity, and smooth finish, it’s a perfect anytime cigar, particularly for those who appreciate a touch of old world elegance in their rotation.

Smoking time was around 60–70 minutes, and it would pair beautifully with a light bourbon or coffee. Would I smoke it again? Absolutely. It’s not flashy - it doesn’t need to be. This is a cigar that carries half a century of legacy in every puff.",3,1770585802.0,cigar_refuge,0,1.0,False

Enjoy mini tiramisu cups ladyfingers and quick tiramisu cups mascarpone that are perfect for satisfying cravings.,"I didn’t wake up intending to make dessert, but then the afternoon rolled around, and I found myself with a craving for something sweet and pick-me-up-ish. Luckily, I had all the makings for these delightful tiramisu cups lying around. They're mini servings of heaven, and the best part is they’re no-bake. I love that you can whip them up in no time and impress anyone - family, friends, or just a way to treat yourself on a cozy Sunday. I grabbed the recipe here: [https://www.amgroyal.com/tiramisu-cups-easy-delicious](https://www.amgroyal.com/tiramisu-cups-easy-delicious)  
  
Here’s what I used for my tiramisu cups:  
  
¾ cup (180 mls) brewed espresso coffee cooled  
2 tablespoons (30 mls) sweet marsala wine  
1 cup (240 mls) heavy cream whipping cream  
1 teaspoon instant espresso powder  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
½ cup (60 grams) powdered sugar icing sugar  
1 cup (250 grams) mascarpone cheese  
12 savoiardi cookies  
Cocoa powder for dusting before serving  
  
How it came together was pretty simple.  
  
1. First thing, I mixed my cooled coffee with the sweet marsala wine in a shallow dish. This is where the ladyfingers soak up all that coffee goodness.  
  
2. I grabbed my electric mixer and whipped the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and instant espresso powder together in a medium bowl until I had those soft peaks forming.  
  
3. In a separate bowl, I mixed the mascarpone cheese with vanilla extract until it was all blended. Easy-peasy!  
  
4. Then, I gently folded that mascarpone mixture into the whipped cream. I was super careful not to overbeat it because I didn’t want it turning into butter.  
  
5. For the fun part, I cut the savoiardi cookies in half and dipped them into the coffee mixture, layering them at the bottom of my dessert cups. I topped each layer with two heaped tablespoons of the mascarpone cream. I did this twice to build up some awesome layers.  
  
6. Finally, I covered the cups with plastic wrap and tossed them in the fridge to chill for at least two hours. I ended up waiting a little longer since I got distracted – but hey, the longer they chill, the better they taste, right?  
  
When it came time to serve, I dusted the tops with cocoa powder, and wow, they looked fancy!  
  
A couple of tips:  
  
\- Use the freshest heavy cream you can find; it makes a world of difference when whipping it up!  
\- Find the right savoiardi - some soak up liquid better than others. I really like mine thoroughly dipped, even if they get a bit mushy. It's just a preference!

So when Saigon Coffee opened, I wanted to try it but was deterred by the congestion. 

Oh, how I regret waiting this long to try it! 

My friend and I committed to going today because we figured it would be a little less busy on Superbowl Sunday. We were wrong - but no regrets! 

Every time I have driven by Saigon Coffee, there has been a line out the door. Today was no exception. But, the workers keep that line \*\*\*moving\*\*\*. Everyone is extremely friendly! The place is well-managed, clean, and efficient. 

My observation is that most customers wanted to get their coffee to go, but there are some seats inside and a couple of tables outside, too.  My friend and I snagged a small inside table to chat and drink our coffee.

I had the Hanoi Egg Coffee and my friend had the Coconut Frappe. (She loved that vegan options were available!) Mine was uniquely creamy: strong coffee with a thick — but not \*too\* thick — layer of this unique eggy/milky topping. Check out the menu here: https://www.saigoncoffee.com/menu.

I am not a big coffee drinker, so bear that in mind when I tell you this coffee kicked my ass. I doubt I’ll sleep for a week. Worth it!

All of this to say: I recommend this place. I will definitely brave the bad parking nightmare again in the future to return. And that’s saying a lot!

The gist is as follows from the WHO website: ""From 1952–1955, the first effective polio vaccine is developed by Jonas Salk and trials begin. Salk tests the vaccine on himself and his family the following year, and mass trials involving over 1.3 million children take place in 1954.

By 1960, a second type of polio vaccine, developed by Albert Sabin, is approved for use. Sabin’s vaccine was live-attenuated (using the virus in weakened form) and could be given orally, as drops or on a sugar cube.""

1qzkzuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1qzkzuk/tried_5_essential_productivity_frameworks_for_90/,"Tried 5 ""essential"" productivity frameworks for 90 days: Here's what actually gave me 45 mins extra focus daily (and what fell flat) 🎯","I used to hate the advice ""just write every day."" It always felt like a setup for failure. My brain would immediately conjure up excuses: ""too tired,"" ""no ideas,"" ""what's the point?"" For years, I cycled through intense bursts of writing followed by weeks of nothing, feeling like a productivity impostor. I'd try to ""willpower"" my way into a daily habit, set ambitious word counts, and inevitably burn out.

It felt like most of the advice out there assumed you had unlimited motivation or that *knowing* what to do was enough. What I really needed was a way to make showing up almost automatic, even on days I truly didn't want to. So, I ran an experiment on myself to build a consistent writing habit, not by grinding, but by making it ridiculously easy to start.

Here's what I actually did and the results:

**The Problem I Was Trying to Solve:** Inconsistent writing, felt like a chore, relied heavily on fleeting motivation.

**What Didn't Work (My Previous Fails):**
*   **Setting high daily word counts (500+ words):** Too intimidating, led to procrastination and eventual burnout.
*   **Waiting for inspiration:** A surefire way to write nothing for weeks.
*   **""Just do it"" willpower approach:** Failed after a few highly-motivated days, especially when life got busy or I was tired.
*   **Trying to force a specific topic:** Often led to staring at a blank page.

**My Personal Growth Experiment: The ""Show Up"" Method**

1.  **The Ridiculously Small Minimum:** My absolute, non-negotiable daily goal became: **""Open my writing app (Obsidian, but any text editor works) and type one sentence.""** Seriously, just one. This was the most crucial shift. It lowered the bar so much that there was almost zero resistance to starting.
2.  **Strict Time-Boxing:** I committed to a **15-minute window**, first thing in the morning before anything else, right after coffee. No more, no less. This wasn't about productivity; it was about consistency. If I only wrote one sentence in 15 minutes, that was a win.
    *   *Initial adjustment:* I started trying for 30 minutes, but found 15 minutes was the sweet spot for consistency without feeling like a burden.
3.  **Environment as a Cue:** My laptop stayed open on my desk. My writing app was the first thing on my screen when I sat down. I even set a recurring daily notification on my phone: ""Writing time.""
4.  **No Pressure on Quality (At First):** The goal wasn't to write a masterpiece, or even anything good. It was just to *move my fingers*. Some days I just brain-dumped thoughts, other days I wrote absolute garbage. That was fine. The quality could come later, in editing.
5.  **Simple Accountability System:** I created a basic spreadsheet with dates. Each day I completed the minimum (one sentence in 15 mins), I put an 'X'. This wasn't about tracking word count, but visually building a chain of consistency. Breaking the chain became surprisingly motivating to avoid.

**The Messy Middle and Actual Results:**

*   **The Struggle:** Seriously, there were days I hated it. I'd sit there, type ""Today I need to write about..."" and then stare blankly for 10 minutes. But because the *goal* was just one sentence, I usually found *something* to add before the timer went off.
*   **Almost Quitting:** Around day 60, I had a crazy travel day. I was exhausted. I almost skipped. But instead, I pulled out my phone in the airport, opened a notes app, and typed one sentence about how tired I was. It counted.
*   **The Setback:** I did break my streak once at 87 days. I felt genuinely terrible. But instead of letting that derail me completely (as it would have in the past), I marked the day as missed and just started a new streak the very next morning. The framework is about recovery, not perfection.
*   **Measurable Improvements:**
    *   **Streak:** My longest consistent ""show up"" streak was **112 consecutive days** using this method.
    *   **Output:** While the *goal* was just one sentence, I typically found myself writing for the full 15 minutes, accumulating an average of **300-500 words** per session. Over 112 days, that's a significant body of raw material.
    *   **Reduced Resistance:** Writing became less of a ""fight"" and more of a routine. The mental hurdle shrunk dramatically.
    *   **Shift in Identity:** I started to genuinely see myself as ""someone who writes daily,"" not ""someone who *wants* to write daily.""

This wasn't about unlocking some secret potential or a life-changing transformation overnight. It was about consistently showing up, chipping away at a habit, and slowly making it a part of my day without needing massive willpower. It's about designing your environment and expectations to make success inevitable, not relying on fleeting motivation.

Speaking of location, I am seeking someone in the USA or Canada only, sorry but need to set a hard limit on distance.

Ok so a bit about me, I have spent most my life both coasts, here in California and also on the East coast with varied other places along the way, but have always been a coastal dweller, to be close to a beach where we can wander the shoreline collecting sea glass and driftwood, the tide washing over our bare feet and gently erasing the footprints we leave behind as we walk side by side. To me, that feels like a near perfect afternoon.

I have varied hobbies and interests, I enjoy cooking for people, photography, the aforementioned writing, TV and Films and really love a good binge session on a quiet or rainy afternoon. I enjoy road trips and discovering new places and exploring the west coast and all its fun spots and haunts, I am a dog person and animal lover in general and try to donate when I can to help shelters and zoos and rescues, a coffee aficionado and dad joke connoisseur, love a good late checkout when traveling and sleeping in occasionally, Home or away, I am more of an introvert vs extrovert, I am transparent AF and do not believe in BS or games, I really hope we share that last interest. I don’t ghost, I would rather let you know if things won’t work out vs vanish and leave you wondering.

And who are you? You're probably the girl next door type I have always crushed on easily rocking a pair of jeans, probably petite and low-maintenance, the artist-psychologist-teacher-creative type, somewhere younger than me, and definitely not having to be the center of attention. You have strong opinions that you'll defend, you work out or run, possibly have some athletic skills, and consumed some of the classic rock that I did in my youth. You'd enjoy sitting on the couch holding hands just as much as going to a fancy dinner and value PDA's and affection. End of the day, one thing about is that You got me and I got you and to us that is all that matters.

I suppose I am some of the things you read on the web about a Taurus man, I am quietly strong, independent, willing to fight for sometimes fruitless causes, empathic, romantic, fiercely loyal, aloof, passionate, pragmatic, devoted. What the web won't tell you is that I like classic rock and jazz and a good street fair or thrift store, garage sale and when I see a handwritten sign on a telephone pole while we are driving, just know that we may be late to where we are going as I gotta stop and check it out lol

I normally do not wager more than -135 on single wager unless if I am nuking it (or if I chasing after my losses), so I'm going 24.25U on the Seahawks ML for several reasons. Hawks are the superior team in all facets, defensive, offensive, special team, and just overall team.

Sam Darnold proved me wrong in the NFC championship game and although I knew that Matthew Stafford was going to be lightsout in that game, Darnold was flawless. 3 Passing TDs, over 300+ Passing Yds and 0 TOs! On the other side Drake Maye has not taken care of the football. He got smoked by the Broncos defense and Chargers defense. **6 Fumbles and 2 INTs.** If you don't kno my football handicaps I always correlate them to the quarterback and right now I have to side wit the Hawks because how well Darnold has been playing. **There's narratives about Darnold also not taking care of the football, he's had his issues wit turnovers but he's really attacked that narrative in his last game against the Rams and outperform than anyone can ever expect from him.** The Rams were the team that knocked him and my Vikes outta postseason last year and this season Rams were demolishing him (even the game the Hawks won on the last season game), but he proved he's learned, adjusted, and improved. 

I don't really need to go over all the other aspects of the team because I think you all kno who the better receiving core, special team and defensive team is. Seriously, must I explain? **JSN had a crazy offensive season, averaging 100 yds/7+ Rec a game. The special team has like the most returned TD and this defensive team allow fewest points.**

**The Play & Prediction :** I'm nuking the Hawks ML at 24.25U to 11.55U. This is a no brainer for me. When I go this large I am supremely confident. I would lay it wit the Hawks if you want a better price, I would even do alternate line up to 9.5 spread. BOL, everyone on your superbowl wagers! Seahawks win 28-10

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond.

1qzkuk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qzkuk2/the_skinwalker_protocol/,The skinwalker protocol,"The story starts with this thing falling near Roswell, but not the famous spot everyone thinks of, just some empty land southeast of there. A rancher finds the crater, pokes at whatever is inside with a shovel, and then it grabs her. Her last thought was about how cold it felt. I think that sets up the whole creepy vibe right away.

Three weeks later, they find the first body in a Nebraska field. Its a deputy, all hollowed out, skin just hanging there with the eyelashes still perfect and lips parted like he was about to say something. Fingernails blue. Sheriff Whitaker stares at it. Kind of makes you wonder how it got that far so quick.

It learns fast, thats the thing. By the fourth day, its wearing the ranchers face, not great though, jaw off a bit, eye leaking tears all the time. But good enough to fool people driving by. It doesnt eat normal food or sleep, just messes around in the kitchen with knives and stuff like that. Then hunger hits again.

The CDC guy calls it the Skinner. It gets human fear, like on a chemical level, doesnt just kill but builds up the terror first. Footage from a gas station in Tulsa shows it cornering this kid working there, presses heads together, and the kids eyes go huge, pupils taking over. Right before it feeds, people smell their old homes burning or something like that. It seems almost smart about it, curating the fear.

Moving on to adaptation. Third victim is a skin doctor, after that it gets fingerprints. By the seventh one, a yoga teacher, it can do voices good enough to call family. Rosenfelds notes talk about this nest in an old Costco, skins piled in a spiral watching videos of birthdays on loop. Thats the part that stands out, all those empty skins just staring.

Last part, at a diner near Flagstaff. Waitress serves coffee to a guy whose neck moves weird. She screams, he smiles with wrong teeth and says something about exhaling to fit better. The cup has no prints, just some residue from skin and stress stuff.

The last victim they know about was this doctor, Lorna Voss, who worked as a forensic pathologist. She got assigned to look at these husks from the Skinner, I think thats what they call the remains. 

In her report, case number 4471-9 or something like that, there was this one weird thing. Every single victim had their adrenal glands taken out, but only after they were dead, surgically removed.

Rosenfeld ended up finding her body in the morgue fridge. It wasnt like the others, hollowed out or anything. No, she got repurposed, which sounds messed up when you think about it. Her ribcage was pried open, almost like someone set up a weird display. 

Instead of a heart, there were 37 of those adrenal glands arranged in a spiral pattern. They were preserved in stuff that smelled like corn syrup, sweet and sticky. Her own hands were holding onto a Dictaphone, cradled right there.

He hit play on it. Lorna's voice came out, but it didnt sound right, too wet and clicking, like something hard inside her mouth. She whispered, lesson learned. Fear tastes better when its aged, thats what she said. Then it went on, youll find the rest in Chicago, Phoenix, Austin. Look for the birthday parties. 

The recording cut off with this noise, a creaking sound. Rosenfeld couldnt figure it out at first. Later that day, he walked by a playground, and there it was, the creak of a swingset moving even though there was no wind. That got to him.

It seems like after that, he bleached his hair blond and took a bus to Winnipeg. Three things kept him from losing it completely. The Skinner always leaves the eyelids intact, thats one. It cant mimic involuntary tears, which makes sense if you picture how it works. And every time it feeds, the fingernails turn blue first.

Now, there are 742 suspected cases spread across 11 states. 

They've got this containment protocol called **Looking Glass** in place. 

If your reflection blinks before you do, just run. 

But dont scream.

It likes when you scream, prefers it even. 

Some people might think thats just a detail, but it stands out, kind of makes the whole thing feel too real. I might be oversimplifying how it all connects, this part gets a bit messy when you try to follow the trail.",1,1770584783.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I'm ashamed to admit and I thought things were changing we had counselling and he seemed to be understanding when I said I needed time to build back my connection with him especially sexually. 

He had been really loving until last night. Since we had split up he's been confiding in a girl he met on a dating app before meeting me. I was okay with this as he promised she was just giving advice so I trusted him. Yesterday I asked how she was doing and he said he doesn't know she's told him she can't speak to him anymore, I asked why? He said he doesn't know they had a phonecall at 2am drunk and he doesn't know what has been said. I let it slide but later in the night he told me a year ago when he went back home to India his friends and him ended up in a club with prostitutes. He promised nothing had happened but admitted even after realising he stayed in the club to get his money's worth of the drinks tokens. 

This really upset me because he comes down so hard on me if I even breathe near another man, which I do not. I took a selfie in a v neck top and he accused me of cheating on him. I have to explain when I'm texting my parents and when I'm going to meet friends for coffee. I was crying and he just sat sipping whiskey so I left his apartment and went home. He never messaged or anything. 

This morning I came to talk and he basically said how I was in the wrong for leaving and brought up any instance I've made a mistake despite me crying and basically said he'd decided it was over because I bring so much drama. He told me he's drank a full bottle of whiskey overnight. 

A few weeks ago he was spiralling and I'm his only person in my country that he has. I texted his family to say I was concerned he was drinking so much I got no response from them. Today he tells me his family blame me and my drama for him drinking and that it's because I won't marry him. I feel stuck in a trauma bond that I just cannot get out of and quite frankly I feel like crap. I feel like everything is my fault all the time. I feel like anything he does to hurt me is considered drama to him but if I dare step out of line slightly it's the end of the world. I'm so stuck in a cycle.

1qzktxg,https://i.redd.it/ocjil3h25cig1.jpeg,Polypropylene bags for potatoes?,"Has anyone used Polypropylene bags to grow potatoes? A local brewery gets their hops delivered in these they gave me a few empty bags, and they seem like great candidates for grow bags. The pic is of a 15 gallon felt bag that I used last year as a size reference, a burlap sack that held coffee beans, and the polypropylene bag.

The poly bag is about 20 inches wide, burlap is about 14 inches, and the felt is about 16 inches (very rough measurements). Last year I grew 3-4 potatoes in the felt bag, so I’m guessing the burlap will safely hold 3 potatoes. But how many potatoes should fit in the poly? Does 6 seem like a good amount?

I plan to start with about 8-10 inches of dirt on the bottom, place seed potatoes, and then add 4-5 inches of soil on top, hilling up as needed throughout the summer. Still not sure if staggering the potatoes in the soil is a good idea or not – currently doing some research on best practices and there’s lots of conflicting info out there.

1qzktpa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qzktpa,Failed matchmaking BR analysis - Sample size: 7 (Seven) (explanation in description),"A quick preambule for those who don't know what this is about: Yesterday, I've posted a screenshot of the match replay, complaining about how the Soviets, at this BR bracket, seem to always have more uptier vehicles than the other team.

One guy doubted me, so I said that I can get the results of 100 replays in 24 hours to prove him wrong.

Well. It was much harder than I've expected.

Here are the three fuck-ups that led to the sample size shrinking down from the promised 100 to 7:

1) I've expected to see the opponent's full roster through the replays. Unfortunately, neither server replays, nor in-game saved replays can show that, for reasons fucking unknown to me. So, as a backup, I've decided to play new 100 matches, until the end, to get the accurate results at the post-match scoreboard. Which leads to the second fuck-up:

2) Last night, after I fell asleep, Russians bombed the civil energy infrastructure in my region. Today, we've had some rocket and drone shelling on the living apartments. Looks like the Russian Fuhrer himself doesn't want me to conduct this research. I haven't had power until 17:30 Kyiv time, only had two hours before the next blackout, and had to tear out the car battery to edit everything together. I've managed to do 10 matches - so you might ask yourself ""Why 7 then?"" Well...

3) I've overestimated how easy it would be to edit the results. I've spent 3 hours editing the results, listened all these hours to Säkkijärven Polkka on repeat non-stop, drank four cups of strong coffee - but didn't manage to edit all 10 matches until 22:30. After 3rd match edit, I couldn't even be bothered to edit in the roster screenshots - so I've written raw numbers for the other 4 instead.

If you dare to suggest that I'm lying - I have ***Every. Single. Screenshot. Of every. Player's Roster. Saved.*** I will literally spam your DMs with them until Reddit bans me.



My head hurts, my mood is foul, this was the most stressful day by quite a margin this year. Imagine spending time until 17:30, not being able to do anything but browsing Reddit, getting pinged with ""remindme"" comments every 30 minutes, seeing everyone expecting me to do this...

But I did. I still did. I did my best, and I've shown you that I wasn't talking out of my ass. I still failed my promise - so no need to apologise to me, instead I'll apologise for failing everyone's expectations - but I've persevered nevertheless, through bombing, blackouts, and severe stress to show these 7 match results as a ""fuck you"" to the guy who doubted the legitimacy of my pattern recognition.",78,1770584730.0,Warthunder,29,0.91,False

I got a match to someone who only gave their email (but so did I. I also only gave my email.) I dont think there was an option to list any other social media or anything. 

Anyways, I was wondering, imagine you were a girl on the receiving end of a match, would it be weird for you to receive an email from a guy on your student email asking you out (or really just mentioning we matched on UBCCupids) or just asking for your social media since you dont use your student email much (who does, I mean really?)

I just wanna know how to contact my match cause I lowkey want to get to know them and why the algorithm matched us (plus Valentines).

Edit: OK barring it was a dumb question, how would I go about asking? I guess it just feels weird for me to send an email saying hey! Im your match on UBCCupids, you wanna get coffee sometime? Here's my insta cause I use this more? 

Also, should I wait a bit in terms of time? Is it too soon to hit her up? I know UBCCupids does this now to give a week to plan a date if ever for Valentines. Should I initiate or wait?

\
In case you're a dweller of Little Rock, Arkansas, and you're aiming to nab some exceptional bargains, you might want to think about exploring Craigslist. Ever since 1995, Craigslist has served as a go-to platform for purchasing, vending, and swapping commodities and amenities locally. With its easy-to-use interface and broad array of categories, Craigslist presents numerous opportunities to discover distinct items at unparalleled prices. In this write-up, let's explore how you can exploit Craigslist to unearth fantastic bargains in Little Rock, Arkansas.\
\
Navigating Craigslist\
\
To commence, visit the Craigslist website and opt for the Little Rock, Arkansas section. You'll encounter a variety of categories, covering items for sale, services provided, housing, employments, and more. In case you have a specific item in mind, utilize the search bar to refine your choices. For instance, if you're on the lookout for a pre-owned vehicle, enter ""pre-owned cars"" into the search bar to view a register of accessible automobiles in your vicinity.\
\
While inspecting listings on Craigslist, it's pivotal to exercise prudence and be on the lookout for fraudulence. Although Craigslist has introduced measures to lessen deceptive activity, it's still imperative to be cautious. Be cautious of bargains that appear too good to be true, and never transfer funds or personal details to someone you haven't met in person.\
\
Items for Sale\
\
One of the most sought-after categories on Craigslist is the ""for sale"" segment, where you can stumble upon a diverse assortment of items, from furniture and gadgets to attire and collectibles. Numerous vendors are motivated to swiftly discard their goods, so you may have the opportunity to negotiate a reduced price. Moreover, you can arrange alerts to be notified when new items in your desired category are listed, enabling you to be one of the first to seize an excellent deal.\
\
In case you're seeking furniture, you can pinpoint everything from couches and tables to bed frames and bookshelves on Craigslist. Numerous sellers simply aim to clear out space in their homes, so you might stumble upon quality pieces at a fraction of the cost of purchasing new. Just make sure to meticulously inspect the item prior to making a purchase, given that there are no assurances or warranties on Craigslist.\
\
Gadgets are another prevalent category on Craigslist, encompassing everything from smartphones and laptops to gaming consoles and televisions. When procuring gadgets, it's prudent to meet the seller in person and test the item before parting with any funds. This can aid you in dodging acquiring a non-functional or pilfered device.\
\
Apart from furniture and gadgets, Craigslist also serves as an exceptional platform to procure clothing, accessories, and collectibles. A multitude of sellers are keen on decluttering their homes and might be inclined to sell top-notch items at discounted prices. Stay alert for designer brands and vintage pieces that you won't encounter elsewhere.\
\
Services Provided\
\
In addition to procuring goods, Craigslist also offers a valuable avenue for finding local amenities in Little Rock, Arkansas. Whether you're in need of a repairman, a pet minder, or a coach, you can pinpoint a broad range of providers on Craigslist. Numerous individuals and small-scale enterprises employ Craigslist to advertise their services, frequently at competitive rates.\
\
While engaging a service provider on Craigslist, it's pivotal to carry out your due diligence. Authenticate the provider's references and reviews, if available, and arrange an in-person meeting before committing to any work. Clearly communicate about the scope of the project and the terms of the agreement to avert any misunderstandings.\
\
Housing\
\
In case you're scouting for a fresh abode, Craigslist can serve as a valuable resource for discovering leasehold properties and residences for sale in Little Rock, Arkansas. The housing segment on Craigslist encompasses listings for apartments, houses, and condos, with choices to suit various budgets and preferences. You can employ filters to narrow down your search by price, size, and location to pinpoint the perfect place for you.\
\
When in pursuit of housing on Craigslist, it's vital to be cautious and alert. Scammers occasionally utilize false listings to attempt to obtain your personal information or funds, so always authenticate the legitimacy of a listing before pursuing it further. If a deal appears too good to be true, it's prudent to err on the side of caution.\
\
Employments\
\
Craigslist also stands as a renowned platform for discovering employment prospects in Little Rock, Arkansas. The employments segment showcases a broad array of openings, ranging from part-time gigs and freelance assignments to full-time roles and apprenticeships. Irrespective of whether you're in search of a role in retail, hospitality, education, or any other industry, you can come across an assortment of options on Craigslist.\
\
When applying for employments on Craigslist, ensure to thoroughly scrutinize the employer and the position to ascertain legitimacy. Research the company and check for any reviews or grievances before scheduling an interview or furnishing personal details. Additionally, exercise caution regarding any job offerings that necessitate upfront payment or appear too good to be true.\
\
Pointers for Utilizing Craigslist\
\
When utilizing Craigslist to unearth bargains in Little Rock, Arkansas, there are several guidelines and best practices to bear in mind. Here are some pivotal tips for leveraging Craigslist effectively:\
\
1. Employ specific search terms: While sifting through listings on Craigslist, deploy specific search terms to aid in narrowing down your choices. For example, if you're on the lookout for a vintage record player, type ""vintage record player"" into the search bar to view pertinent listings.\
\
2. Act promptly: Exemplary bargains on Craigslist have a tendency to be swiftly snapped up, hence it's crucial to act promptly upon encountering something of interest. Expediently get in touch with the seller to schedule a meeting and secure the item.\
\
3. Negotiate courteously: When making an offer on an item, be considerate and rational in your negotiation. Most sellers on Craigslist are open to bargaining, but it's crucial to approach the process with finesse.\
\
4. Arrange secure meetings: When meeting with a seller or service provider, always opt for a secure and public location, such as a coffee shop or a local establishment. Refrain from meeting at someone's residence or a secluded area.\
\
5. Trust your instincts: If something feels awry or too good to be true, have faith in your instincts and proceed with caution. It's preferable to be safe than sorry when using Craigslist.\
\
Conclusion\
\
Craigslist can serve as a worthwhile resource for seizing exceptional bargains in Little Rock, Arkansas. Whether you're in need of furniture, gadgets, amenities, housing, or employments, Craigslist presents an extensive array of options for discovering what you require. By exercising caution and being diligent, you can effectively harness Craigslist to stumble upon distinctive items at unparalleled prices.

I find it kind of ironic given that their platforms are built around “optimal health” and clean living.

I’m genuinely curious if there’s a common denominator here. My theory (pure speculation) is that it could be related to the sheer amount of supplements they consume, especially since many of them promote multiple brands. Even influencers who claim to eat mostly Whole Foods are still regularly pushing protein powders, pre-workout, greens, collagen, etc.

For example, Sydney often talks about clean ingredients and Whole Foods, but she also has a daily protein coffee. Not knocking supplements entirely — I’ve taken them myself — but realistically, most people don’t take them consistently unless they’re sponsored, because they’re expensive and add up fast.

Obviously infertility can be caused by underlying medical conditions, stress, age, or genetics. But when it seems this common within one niche, it makes me wonder if lifestyle factors unique to that space (supplement overload, extreme training, low body fat, hormonal disruption?) play a role.

Quick upfront honesty: I work in real estate, so I know this is going to sound like I’m defending the industry no matter how I phrase it. That’s kind of baked in.

I’m not here to sell anyone on anything or convince you agents are worth X dollars. I am sharing accurate, local context so people can make their own calls without feeling unarmed or misinformed. It's important to start by identifying a key item. Commission isn’t “income” the same way your salary is. Most agents don't have a salary. They are entrepreneurs who self manage. So commission is akin to top line gross revenue for a small business. That distinction matters. With that out of the way, there's only one more note for you. You should feel free to disagree. Feel free to challenge. My goal here is not persuasion, it’s information. So here goes…

A bunch of you said roughly the same thing in the last thread:

“5% for minimal effort feels outrageous”, or something along those lines 

Yup. Totally fair reaction. Especially right now.

From the outside it's like:

house goes on MLS, 5 days pass, dozen offers show up, deal closes, 20k over asking, agent posts humble brag fake gratitude post on insta. 

Yeah… I’m with you, actually. Ew.

So obviously the question arises. Why the hell does this cost tens of thousands of dollars? Well, I’m giving you an answer. It’s honest, and perhaps more importantly, it’s true. At least from my perspective. That doesn’t mean, however, that you’ll accept it, and it certainly doesn’t mean you’ll like it. But, you asked for it. So here it is.

You’re not paying for the act of selling your house. That's an isolated event; a moment in time. You’re paying for it having been sold. That’s the conception, formation, execution, and finalization of a process. The evolution and fruition of a plan.

So now you’re thinking, “I hate this guy”, because that sounds like the same thing twice with too many long words the second time. Or at most, that it might sound subtly different. Well, it isn’t subtly different. It’s completely different. Dramatically. 

Selling is an action.

Having sold is an outcome.

Anyone can list a house. Literally. 

But what people actually care about isn’t a listing. Then what is it? Well….

Did it sell?

Did it sell for the right price?

How long did it take?

Did it line up with my personal timeline for my kids school, job transfer, tax refund, separation agreement...?

Did the deal survive inspections, financing, appraisal, cold feet, and their uncle who knows evryt’n ‘bout ‘ouses?

Did it close on time? Did it close at all?

Did it avoid legal or financial fallout? 

Are you covered through the statute of limitations if it did, but just barely?

That’s the part you’re paying for. That's the process.

It also occurs to me that people likely don’t know this, but most of the work happens before the listing ever goes live:

analysis of market demographics to find likely buyer fields

Assessment of best use (this ensures top dollar. House value depends on buyer use/need)

pricing strategy

marketing campaign and execution

offer structure planning

researching/understanding buyer psychology

anticipating inspection issues and managing impact

positioning the property

building demand

preparing negotiation paths

	....from my laptop, I can actually feel your annoyance brewing, so I’ll move on without finishing… 

But to have it said, you asked for exactly this. 

When those systems are built properly, the visible part looks easy. The easy is what you see, and what frustrates you.

It's not an accurate indication, though.

It’s design. The easier it is for you, the better the job has been executed. Your agent is removing your obstacles and your stress, not teasing you with them in an effort to stack them on a shelf like trophies. 

The actual money part?

Firstly, and this was mentioned in the thread before, but i’ll reiterate — the 5% doesn’t go to one person. Or at least, extremely rarely.

Roughly speaking (varies by brokerage):

half goes to the buyer’s agent

half goes to sellers’

both agents pay their brokerage/office

then HST

then marketing costs (photos, video, ads, signs, etc.)

Some people might imagine:

One agent pockets 5%

Said agent goes to Florida for the winter

Again, I’m with you. Ew. 

But what actually happens is each side ends up with a fraction of those 5 points. And that's before they pay their taxes and expenses. Here's a quick note on costs and time because some people specifically asked what actually goes into a deal behind the scenes.

It varies wildly, of course. But on the listing side alone there’s: 

professional photos/video

3d tours

paid advertising (creation and distribution)

signage + materials

brokerage splits

HST

plus weeks (in this market) or months (every other market we've ever had ever) of work that only gets paid if the deal actually closes

On top of that, most agents are running an actual business. So there’s insurance, licensing, office fees, software, vehicles, gas, employee payroll, education, etc.

Again, not saying this for sympathy, just for completeness. 

\*Side note: it was suggested that I would legitimise myself if I disclosed how much I personally pay for some of these things. I thought about that suggestion, and I have a 2-fold response. Firstly, I’m not here to legitimise myself. If I were looking to boost my ego as a real estate professional, the last place I’d seek validation would be Reddit. I think we can all agree on that. I’m here to offer clarity and information. Full stop. Secondly, yeah okay. Sure.I have no issue with this. However, I’m unfairly vulnerable here because it’s like I showed up to a costume party without knowing it’s a costume party. (Ya’ll are mostly anonymous. In case the simile didn’t land.) But my contact info is super easy to find, and I’ll even buy the coffee. I know my average cost of sales per transaction for every year since returning to work after a little health-related hiatus. So giv’er. I’m game.

Now on with the show.

Regardless of expenses, the bigger point is still the same. Most of the value isn’t in the visible tasks, nor should it be. It’s in preventing expensive mistakes and steering complex situations to a clean outcome. And that means where the value usually shows up isn’t clear or distinct from the outside. Because most deals don’t fail publicly. They fail quietly behind the scenes… unless someone intervenes. And this is where things get expensive if they’re handled poorly. 

Some common tangly bits:

financing collapses

inspections kill momentum

appraisals come in low

title is a clear as a Torbay morning

buyers panic

sellers get emotional

negotiations stall

timelines blow up

Those moments can cost people real money.

You don’t see that part though, because when it’s done right, it never becomes visible. Again, by design.

Now for what I think is the best part. And it's probably also the part I'll get complained to our local board about because it's an uncomfortable truth most agents won’t say:

There are absolutely situations where “full” commission doesn’t make sense. 

Examples? Sure:

extremely hot, straightforward properties

private sales between known parties

simple transactions with very little complexity

pre-assembled or off-market deals

Any flat-fee, discount brokerage, or limited-service option could be reasonable in those cases (provided they are good at their job. Just like whatever you do for a living, not all participants are created equal in this ring either). Anyone claiming otherwise, especially anyone in the industry, isn’t being honest (with themselves or you). And on top of this, commissions are negotiable. So go for it.

There’s another uncomfortable truth though. The reality that the biggest financial loses almost always come from the same few mistakes:

poor strategy (marketing and pricing)

weak negotiation

misunderstanding buyer behaviour and psychology 

bad offer structure

emotional decisions (this one is devastating)

Those mistakes can be embarrassingly expensive.

So what are your real options?

As a seller, you generally have four:

full service — highest cost, most protection

limited service / flat fee — cheaper, more risk on you

FSBO — lowest cost, highest workload + exposure to mistakes

private sale — works sometimes, very situation dependent, but awesome if you pull it off

None of these are “wrong.” They all do different things, and are used by different people to accomplish different tasks for different reasons. I personally like that there are so many different business models. It keeps people honest, and competition is always better for the end user (that's you). 

But, they all have different tradeoffs too. So understand the risk/reward equation of each option, and balance it to your personal appetite. 

To try and bring this thing to a conclusion, I'll offer some guidance that's so obvious and stupid that it probably never gets addressed. If you’re paying commission (or any money for any thing ever, for that matter), you should understand exactly what you’re getting for it.

If you don’t feel the value is there, you should absolutely question it. I'd consider that a non-negotiable, and a grave mistake on your behalf if you don't.

At the best of times, housing is emotional, expensive, and stressful. People deserve straight answers, not industry spin or a Don Draper sales pitches. If this is useful, I’m happy to do more of these when relevant. If not, no harm done. Other than to my ass for squeezing its full 2 halves into this thing. But then again, just like you, I asked for this.

Oh… And feel free to challenge this. As if you needed  permission…

with sincerity,

I’m 27 and a new dad. My partner gave birth 8 weeks ago tomorrow and we have had the usual ups and downs but are very happy with our new life. 

My main thought through this whole time since the baby came home is, am I doing enough for my partner and our child? Along with doubt about being a good enough dad. I work from home so have the pleasure of seeing them both most the day. 

The crux of the situation:-

I feed her maybe two to three times per day, do two night shifts a week (Friday and Saturday) change her nappy the same amount. 

I play with her 5/6 times a week after work and sometimes before (if she is awake) and also deal with witching hour along side my partner

Sort bottles and sterilising etc in between feeds alongside her.

I am normally the one to settle her at the night time, I just have more patience to stay awake when she thinks the dark ceiling is the most interesting thing in the world aha. 

Household wise I do the vast majority of the cooking, lunch and dinner, a slightly larger part of the cleaning jobs. Take our two dogs for a walk 6 days a week whilst she will take them on the other one and any other time she fancies a break on my lunch hour.

She collects the shopping as it gives her a hour or two of free time.

Bring her water and coffee refills when I go for mine 

My partner thinks that most of this stems from me working from home, but not being able to help out a lot at work, I still take her if she is really struggling or needs to go out on my lunch hour etc. our families also haven’t been anywhere near as supportive as they were hyping them selves up to be, we know this is solely our responsibility however, can just suck lol, so she feels I am overcompensating for them, I do agree with this but am just looking for reassurance or pointers on anything else I could do?

Just finished my first week dropping my dose down to 50 mcg 6 days a week. prior that that I was on 75 mcg/37.5mcg on alternative days, but it felt too intense so I was skipping a dose (to feel normal) nearly every week for the last couple of months and eventually got down to 75mcg one day a week and 37.5mcg the other days. Still had to skip  day every week or 2. Felt like too much when I was taking 75s 3 or 4 days per week. What prompted all of the changes was a big diet change last Fall- eating very clean, barely any alcohol and very little caffeine. Anytime I had done that in the past, it greatly affects how much Synthroid I need.

Finally talked to my doc. We ran some labs and she said She'd prescribe me 50 instead of the 75s.

I was first acquainted to you when I was a little girl. I was 5 years old and a bridesmaid for my aunts wedding. I loved the sound of the champagne bottle being popped. Everyone cheering for you and cheersing their glasses in celebration. It made people laugh louder, smile harder.  The atmosphere became jovial whimsical even magical. You masked yourself very well. As I moved around with my parents growing up you were in every single country we went to, in every corner of the world. 

When I was 16 I got drunk for my very first time. You welcomed me in, with open arms and a warm hug. You made more likable, more talkative, more free willed and confident. I thought I had a good friend when I needed you. Your mask started to slip when I reached college, although it had slipped a bit during high school I still fell for your disguise. Even through the embarrassing night outs we could still laugh together at what I did the night before. And if it wasn’t a good night you promised to make up for it next time. So, I kept you around even though now you felt like a fair weathered friend, I still trusted you. Little did I know you were bringing me further and further away from my true self who my family and friends used to love so much. I was slowly catching on but I at least had to give you 5 more years of making it up to me, even though you never did.  I became belligerent, embarrassing, spiteful, angry and ugly. You made me a disappointment. Along with this you made me feel completely ok with that. You made me trust people who were dishonest and evil. Most likely battling with you themselves as well. 

Your mask fully and finally came off when I was 30. Now I knew who you were. But at this point it was too late. We were in it for the long haul. You attached yourself to me especially while going through hardships. Even though I knew you were bad for me I still relied on you. So, we devised a plan- I’ll just keep you a secret. No one needed to know we were in a toxic relationship. And in the beginning- we fooled everyone. I’m sure you loved it when COVID happened, now you have me alone to yourself  for most of the day as I worked at home. I spent my lunch breaks with you which eventually included the moment i woke up. You were slowly dragging and pulling me further and further into your ultimate plan- to have me fully reliant on you. To move Jennifer away from her values and beliefs which my honorable mother and father instilled in me. And it worked. I became even more ugly, unreliable, unmotivated, vile and sick. 

When you got what you wanted I was sitting in a hospital bed on suicide watch with little recollection as to how I got there. I’m sure you were proud of yourself. As I lay there in the hospital bed humiliated and embarrassed it was now time to admit to my family that your hold on me was too strong, and I needed help. This problem with you is much bigger than me. My father who is a decorated Seabee vet and fought in Vietnam and gallantly earned a Purple Heart, said the most scariest and heartbreaking thing he witnessed was me in active addiction thinking that this beautiful life wasn’t worth it and I didn’t want to be here. As far as soulmates go I believe it’s the person who knows you best with your flaws, probably even more than you know yourself, and that was my loving father. You changed me into someone else who was not Jennifer. I’m still trying to get her back. 

The most precious thing you took away from me was time. Since my family now knew about my drinking- now we had to be extra secretive.

A few more months passed and we were still in our toxic relationship. At this point I knew your tricks so I decided for my nephews birthday party on March 6th of last year, I would not drink until my family had left. My father was there and as he usually always does he asked me how I was, asked if I needed anything, told me he loved me but he was feeling a bit depressed. Which is highly unusual for such a positive, happy and confident man. I also knew him saying he was depressed wasn’t bc of me bc he said no matter what I could never make him feel that way. Instead of diving into that conversation head on and making sure my hero was ok I was rushing him through the conversation so I could get to you. I was too selfish to actually listen. I never found out what it was that was making him sad bc that was the last time I would ever see him. 

He passed away suddenly on March 11th 2024. All the promises I made myself that I would be a better daughter and live up to the potential person my dad knew I was, was gone. You took that precious time away from me. All the broken promises I swore I would make up to him such as grabbing coffee with him, not missing his daily calls, completing school and to finally see me truly and whole heartedly enjoy being alive. He never got to see me without you secretly hiding somewhere within the last 4 years before his passing. You were always around.

You were there for me once he was gone. I knew I was lying to myself yet again about you. Thinking that you could make me feel better, if only for a short while. Over the months you dragged me further and further down to hell with you, you were happy when I lost the relationships with my family bc of my dependency on you. While my mother was grieving you turned me into a vicious person she was afraid to confine in. 

I am telling you right now ,you are dead to me. You will not win. You will no longer be in my life to turn me into the demon that you slowly orchestrated when I first felt your presence at 16. My addiction- you will not turn me into the diabolical, spiteful arrogant person you so fondly love. My higher power is with me, my family is behind me. This life is too beautiful and my time is too precious. I stand strong and I finally surrender. ",0,1770583258.0,stopdrinking,2,0.5,False

Silver gleamed in my eyes as I looked at the Dragons-eye amulet. Untattered, it still shone as if it were polished not a few moments before. Not even Grant’s fingers, wet from his drink, left anything behind as he handed it to me.

“Figured you’d want it back,” he said. “Now I really need to study.” Closing the door gently behind him, he escaped into his room.

Holding the amulet in my hand, it was cool to the touch, and I reached out in my mind, “*... Dragon?*” Nothing. I felt absolutely nothing. It really must have all been a dream.

But what about the knife?

I sat back on the couch and, for once, had no inclination to waste my time. Watching television felt like a bore. Even gaming, something I’ve always loved in the past, seemed completely uninteresting to me. Maybe I was just depressed? I’d heard of that happening to people who have profound hallucinations.

Over and over, I rolled the amulet in my hands; I even considered trying to find some more drugs hidden in the fridge. But, knowing Grant, after I ended up missing, he threw anything else we had away. And it didn’t seem like a smart idea to go on an acid-induced binge again.

It’s a miracle I survived the first time.

I set the amulet down and said pleadingly, “Dragon, if you can hear me, give me a sign. Anything to let me know you’re there. Otherwise… I think I need to sell you to make rent. Please come on.” Then, like an answer from the heavens, the coffee table began to smoke. I quickly snatched the Dragons-eye. “*Dragon!*”

No response.

Looking down, I saw my still-lit cigarette burning the wood black, a small stream of smoke drifting from the hole. I sighed, lifting the cigarette to my mouth and taking a drag into my lungs.

Looking back at the amulet, I whispered, “It was sort of nice having a ride along. But this is real life—not fantasy. Dragons don’t just grant powers to humans like in fiction. We humans need to go out and earn that power for ourselves. Become something greater than ourselves. If my drug-addled brain was trying to teach me something through you, then it was this: Don’t waste your life, Ike.”

I could have sworn I felt a nod of approval from the amulet, and, not wishing to be away from it, I put it in my pocket, tapping my cigarette out on an ashtray, and walking towards the door.

\*\*\*

I pulled on the door to Ruby’s pawnshop, but, unlike earlier, it didn’t budge. Unperturbed, I pulled harder—so hard that my fingers slipped and I almost fell into the dirty alley water.

“Must be closed,” I said to nobody in particular. Tapping the amulet in my pocket, I added, “Guess you can stay with me a little longer.”

“Again and again,” a familiar voice said from behind.

“You’ve got to be shitting me,” I replied, turning. “You two. Again?”

“Pleasant surprise is all,” the skinny thief said, adjusting his dirty hood. “And I’d think you’d learn to look in the dark corners before coming down any alleyways. Or perhaps never come down one at all. No matter, your ill luck is my gain. I was here for that tranny bitch, but you’ll do.”

As he came into sight, I could see his broken wrist was bandaged and had a cast.

“That hurt?” I asked, pointing towards it. Looking around, I saw nobody else. “Where’s your friend?”

“Difference of opinion,” the thief replied, reaching into his pocket and pulling out an ancient-looking gun.

I raised my hands in the air, dropping my lit cigarette. “Wait—just wait.” Fear made it hard to breathe as I stammered. “I’ll-give-you-anything. No games—no shit talking. Here—” I reached in my pocket, feeling my wallet. Pulling it out, I threw it to the floor. “There ya’ go, everything I have.”

“*Liar!*” the thief replied, circling me so my back was towards a dead end. “I can see something else in your pocket.”

Reaching in, I felt the cold, intricate smoothness of the amulet against my fingertips. Next to it, the knife I’d taken earlier.

“Here.” I pulled the knife out and threw it next to the wallet. “It’s yours, anyway. Now that’s it. Just let me go.”

The thief scratched the back of his own head with the barrel of the gun. “Alright, alright.” He lowered the piece, aiming it at the ground. “You can go.” He waved me on, using the gun to point the way.

Slowly, I moved past him, seeing the beckoning street ahead.

My freedom.

Time slowed—just as it had done in the past. Sensing danger, I turned to see the man holding the gun aimed straight towards me, the tip of it exploding as the bullet left the chamber. As soon as I realized what it was, my body reacted, and I dodged the bullet as it streaked past my head.

“What the fuck—’’ the thief said, shooting again, and again. Each time, my body moved of its own accord, and I quickly closed the distance between us. He shot again, and this time, I rolled to the ground, grasping the knife I’d dropped earlier in my hand. Like a skilled combat veteran, my fingers nimbly disabled the lock, flipping the blade into place as the tip found the man’s throat in a smooth sort of dance. He didn’t even call out as my blade slit into his skin.

The gun clattered to the floor, and fresh blood painted my face. It was warm, and it smelled metallic. I stepped back, wiping it off with the back of my sleeve. The man staggered a few steps back from me, fear so palpable in the air that I could cut it with the very knife I held. Eventually, he collapsed, and pulled himself awkwardly onward. I walked forward to stab him again, but a shrill shriek from the street stopped me.

The thief looked up at me from his knees, holding the open wound in his neck awkwardly, but the blood was flowing too quickly.

He was already dead; he just didn’t know it yet.

I walked by him as I heard the murmur of the crowd gathering at the alleyway’s entrance. Faintly, I could hear the screams of a woman off in the distance as bystanders circled her.

*“My baby! My baby!*” she cried.

The thief still struggled to breathe, and that filled me with an immense satisfaction. As the murmurs became louder, I turned away, running for a blocked-off portion of the fence. Hurriedly, I threw myself onto and over it, climbing as best I could, ripping my shirt in a few places as I did. Eventually, I vaulted over, landing on the other side.

I pocketed the knife as I left the alleyway, turning towards home and trying not to act like a man who’d just committed a murder. As I turned the corner, I heard sirens off in the distance.

\*\*\*

I spoke not a word to Grant as he brought me food, leaving it in front of me and quickly going back to his room. He always could sense when something was wrong, and he knew better than to pry… sometimes.

I simply stared at the TV, watching the nightly news. It was abuzz about a murder in an alleyway nearby. A gunman, Quinn Poverly, had shot from an alleyway into a crowded street. The police were currently looking for a suspect: male, large build, tall, with long-straight blond hair. I touched my own blond hair and frowned. And, as I did, the reporter said what I feared the most.

“**There was a single victim. We are not releasing the name due to privacy, but we can confirm that the victim was ten years old. They are currently in critical—**”

I turned the TV off, setting the controller down as gently as I could.

“It’s my fault,” I whispered, squeezing the Dragons-eye amulet with all my strength. “It should have been me. It should have been me… Say something! I know you’re real. I know this is real… *so say something!*” I threw the amulet across the room, hitting the opposing wall. It left a break in the drywall as it fell to the carpet below.

Holding my own head with both hands, I swayed back and forth. Was this how comic book heroes felt when they failed? When they couldn’t save someone?

“No…” I thought. “*This is real. If I were faster, none of this would have happened. If I were braver, none of this would have happened… If I had stopped him the first two times, none of this would have happened.*”

It was all my fault.

My sister and mom have always fought my entire life and it was never normal fighting. It was aggressive my mom would throw things and would get super scary. This weekend we were supposed to have a family birthday weekend but upon arrival to the hotel my mom (55) threw the hotel key into my sisters (27) face and told her to fuck off and stormed off. I started following her then my sister said “of course you follow her you don’t even realize she’s going insane” so then i stopped in the middle of the hallway and I just started shaking. Everytime when this happened when I was little I would have the same reaction, I just shut down and my nervous system goes out of control. They continue to fight and then my mom kicks her out of the hotel room. My mom then calls my other sister and says how much she hates my sister( the one she is fighting with) and how she wishes she would kill herself already. At this point I am disassociating in the lobby. My sister storms off somewhere and my mom is texting me. I eventually go to the hotel room and my mom then continues to say how she’s gonna take my sisters cats to the shelter and all this awful stuff. I told her I’m uncomfortable and that she shouldn’t be saying stuff like this about my sister to me. We sit there in silence for a while then decide to get coffee and go thrifting, I’m uncomfortable and awkward I want to go home or be alone but I have no way of doing that. We then meet up with my other sister (not the one she’s fighting with) and get dinner I am acting weird because I am so uncomfortable being put in the middle. At the end of the night we tell my mom that we are meeting up with our sister to get drinks she’s like “oh ok haven fun” passive aggressively and then turns to me and is like I feel like ur mad at me. I say I am very uncomfortable, to which she responds “oh brother”. My sister stood up for me and said she has a right to feel uncomfortable you guys put her in an uncomfortable position. So we get drinks with our sister it’s fun whatever. The next day she shows up at my sisters apartment, we all slept there and it’s so awkward. Then I go back to the hotel to back my things to which I see brown sticky stuff all over my toiletries and then I see chocolates in the trash can. She spit on my belongings. SHE SPIT ON MY BELONGINGS because I didn’t take her side??? I’m not ANYONES side I’m sick and tired of being put in the middle of their immature and petty fights. I have no returned home and am very confused on how I feel towards my mom. Yes my sister can be fucking insane and it is very frustrating that she is still living at home but to say “I wish she would just kill herself already” about her own daughter is unforgivable.

1qzjzer,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1qzjzer/detailed_review_of_unico_2087/,Detailed Review of Unico 2087,"Detailed review of Unico 2087

With all of the promos on YouTube, Instagram etc., wanted to give an honest review of the resort.

Cost: 5900 CAD for two, 7 nights, we cheaped out and booked flights separately, and this stay also required us to switch rooms mid trip, which the staff accommodated without issue. We arrived the day before to Akumal so were able to start our first day at the resort in the morning which is a huge win and they were kind enough to let us access everything. 

Beach: IMO the beach is actually pretty nice. We went in with the expectation that it would suck, but there was minimal seaweed, significantly less crowded without rows of seats like you’d get at the Fives, and lots of room to swim. The sand was quite nice, no flies biting us. We really liked the beach. 

Decor: Really does give boutique high end vibes.

Room: beautiful, large rooms with comfy king sized beds, waterfall shower, outside tub etc. The “ocean view”was quite nice albeit a fair distance from the water and the garden view was behind the snack bar so not exactly a pleasant view. I don’t think the ocean view is worth the extra money unless you plan on spending tons of time on the balcony. However it was cold in Mexico this week and the room was VERY cold. We could not find a heating function. 

Food: We are major foodies, having dined at several Michelin star restaurants, up to three stars. For an all-inclusive the food here is fantastic. However, I’d like to highlight that it is very inconsistent. An example: we dined at 2087 for lunch, and the first salmon/flank steak was phenomenal. Like truly phenomenal. I’m talking juicy, perfect medium rare, crispy skin, flaky texture. It was some of the best cooked salmon I’ve had. The next day both were nearly inedible— steak unsalted and well past well done, salmon completely raw inside with soggy skin and no seasoning. This is not hyperbolic, it was genuinely inedible. The contrast the next day was baffling. 

Similarly, the poolside pizza was a true wood fire oven. If you caught them at a time they weren’t absolutely slammed, it was again, phenomenal. I would always recommend getting it well-done as they do have a tendency to undercook it, which makes it go from a 9 to a 5.5. At busy times, this is sometimes lost in translation however and we had to be quite persistent asking.

Avec was the best restaurant. We dined there four times. If you can’t get a reservation try to show up at 6pm and ask, or similarly ask the host/hostess for another favorable time in the week. The first night we ate at 930pm, they ran out of the beef Wellington, escargot, amongst others. The lamb ribs were nearly unchewably tough. The second time the food was better, the Wellington was pretty good, but the third and fourth times everything was fucking great. The Foie gras, beef and pastry, avec salad, seafood platter, smoked salmon, bread, and cocktails were all on point. It genuinely tasted like we were eating at an upscale restaurant. In our opinion the cocktails here were the best of the restaurants. The apple tart and creme brulee were both also great.

Mi Carisa: probably our number two. Fantastic filet, actually pretty good wines, good prosciutto salad, the lasagna was surprisingly very good, nice bread selection. We did not try any of the pasta. Beef carpaccio also good and same with the pizza (ask for well done). Whipped feta was soo indulgent.  

Cuevo Siete: also very good. You can get a lot of the same dishes at lunch such as the marlin tostada or the pig tacos, but the highlight here was the Mayan coffee. They also had a fantastic cocktail that was served in a fish bowl style here. Overall a solid meal. Good ceviche. Again a great beef filet. I would say their beef is consistently very very good here. 

Mura House: Overall still a solid meal, but the Asian style restaurants at all inclusives tend to be our least favorite. We thought the sushi at 2087 lunch was actually better than the dinner at Mura. One stand out dish was the ribs here, nicely caramelized (very bad rice as a side), we appreciated that the spring rolls were actually hand made. Nigiri was butchered, but if you’re craving sashimi/nigiri you can still get your fix. Fried rice was just fine. We are biased because we have a zojirushi rice cooker at home, make our own nigiri, kimchi fried rice etc, but it seems many other people we came across really enjoyed it here. It was certainly the best attempt at this style we’ve seen.

2087: we didn’t go for dinner so can’t comment. 

Snack bar: great shrimp tacos, guac, ceviche consistently. Wings kinda sucked, and same with the burrito. 

Room service: burger is pretty decent, breakfast was very sub par (including coffee), and same with the quesadillas. Chicken fingers slapped. 

Cafe Ines: first espresso style coffee at an all inclusive that was actually decent we’ve tried. The chia seed puddings are super tasty. Quality of coffee dipped during busy times, but overall very impressive for an all inclusive. Decent smoothie choices too but not the best I’ve seen. 

Alcohol: I have a bit of a mixed bag here. Overall there is fantastic high end choices like grey goose, patron, etc. there are a lot of crowd pleasing drinks/cocktails, which overall I found too sweet and would ask for half sweetness if I ordered. I did find on some occasions that the drinks were very watered down— did ask for a side tequila shot to fill the margarita glass a couple times. For reference, when we went to the mixology class where we made our own drinks, they were notably stronger. But ultimately there were several cocktails that I think would not feel out of place at a high end cocktail bar. I felt the majority were at Avec as mentioned. Modelo, Pacifico, corona for beer. Gatorades in the room for the morning after. 

Spa: I’m not fond of the way they structure the “resort credits”. They give you an exorbitant price like 1000 USD for a couples massage, and the “resort credits” cover 75% of the cost. We attended a seminar (see below) that gave us a free couples 50m massage. We had originally planned to purchase a 80m couples massage with the credits, but after the 50m one we decided against it. Others at the resort stated they had quite positive experiences with massages, facials etc. We did not feel it was worth the price tag after our massage.

Seminar: easily the worst part of the trip and not worth the free credits. They eat up at least an hour of your day to discuss a time share alternative purchasing planning. To be honest they presented a very compelling offer, one that I think we may have considered purchasing had they not turned it into an aggressive “do it now or else!” Vibe. This immediately turned us off and we had to go through three separate sales people just to leave, felt like a good cop bad cop vibe. 

Gym: new facility, dumbbells up to 50lbs, cables, one rack, stair master, treadmills, certainly serviceable for the week and not super busy. 

Service: overall some of the best staff we’d had at a resort. Deborah was a fantastic lead to bring energy and laughs with a great deal of the social events, they all work their ass off. We didn’t sit down for more than a few minutes without being immediately offered a drink or food. The servers are attentive, kind, funny, and so accommodating. They went out of their way at restaurants to know us by name. The butler service is fine if it’s important toyou and you’re into that and you need help booking restaurants, excursions etc, but we didn’t really do that. 

Entertainment: re: live shows, we didn’t really attend these

Pools: I thought the pools were great. Relaxed if you wanted, music if you wanted, activities, no matter what time of day you go you can find a seat if you look for a few mins. The black flooring makes them very nice visually as well.

Activities: hat painting was cute, some of the art classes were a fun little pre dinner activity, friends said they enjoyed the snorkeling but it was a touch cold for us and same with the kayaking. Pretty awesome these were included. We did the line dancing and bingo which was pretty fun too. We didn’t do much with regard to the shows, can’t comment.

Overall: I would certainly come back here. It’s a small resort. One of our favorite things to do was to play a game of chess in the lobby bar, they’d have live music occasionally which was nice, then make a quick strut to the restaurant. Fairly easy to meet people with how it’s structured, and the food really did live up to the hype with some of the caveats above. 

I’ll also add that I have a very sensitive stomach when traveling and both me and my partner had zero digestive issues this trip. That’s a huge win IMO given all the ceviche, fresh salads and whatnot that we ate. This is one of the first times where no one in our party had TD in Mexico.

I’ve used the [Baran Bakery Turtle Cake](https://baranbakery.com/turtle-cake/) recipe. A few notes on it - (1) I made 2 cakes and had around 600g of buttercream left over. (2) I would not follow the caramel-making technique in the recipe, just leave the sugar be without swirling it every couple of minutes, it’s much more foolproof. Making it according to the recipe turned into crystallized sugar, which I saved by adding some water and a few drops of lemon juice. (3) The cake is very sweet, though the recipe insists not to reduce the sugar. However, it’s a personal preference, I myself find American style buttercream too sweet.

1qzjv9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/WithoutATrace/comments/1qzjv9e/rey_rivera/,Rey Rivera,"Rey Rivera was a 32-year-old writer and aspiring filmmaker who recently moved to Baltimore with his wife, Allison, at the behest of his best friend, Porter Stansberry. On May 16, 2006, he left his home in a hurry. His body was found on May 23 at the Belvedere Hotel. His death was ruled undetermined by the medical examiner. Police believe he committed suicide. His family disagrees with the suicide notion and believes he was murdered.
Rey was very close to his family; growing up, his father was in the military, so he and his family were constantly moving. As a result, they spent most of the time with each other. In November 2005, he and Allison married in Puerto Rico. His family described him as happy and fun-loving. According to Allison, his dream was to become a writer and director. They had previously lived in southern California where he hoped to become a filmmaker. However, the jobs he could find were not bringing in much money.
Rey turned to his friend Porter, who was living in Baltimore. They had been friends since high school and played water polo together. After high school, they remained friends. Porter had a company, Stansberry Associates, that wrote financial newsletters. He had always wanted Rey to come write for him. Even though Rey did not know finance or stocks, Porter was persistent and really wanted to work with him.
In December 2004, Rey took a job writing financial newsletters for Porter in Baltimore. He and Allison moved there but knew little of the area. They made a pact that they were going to live there for twenty-four months. They soon found a great home, church, and community there. According to Allison, they were very happy there.
On May 16, 2006, Allison prepared to leave for a business trip. That morning, Rey woke up with her and made her breakfast. Before she left, he carried her suitcase for her and put it in her car. She then left for a three-hour drive. At around 6pm, after finishing her meetings, she checked into the hotel and called him. However, he did not answer, which she felt was strange.
At the time, Rey and Allison had a house guest, Claudia, who was a work colleague of Allison's. Later that night, Allison called her and asked about Rey. She said that at around 6:30pm, she had heard him answer a call on his cell phone. She then heard him run out of the house in a hurry. While on the phone with Allison, she checked around the house and noticed that all of the lights were on. However, he had not returned home. The next morning at 5:30am, Claudia called Allison and told her that he still had not returned.
Allison was certain that something was wrong. She immediately left her hotel and returned home. She called Rey's family and friends, but no one had heard from him. His brother, Angel, was certain that something had happened to him. That afternoon, he flew to Baltimore to help search for him. When Allison arrived home, she noticed that his car was not there. In the kitchen, she found an opened soda can, a bag of chips, and his Invisalign braces. Upstairs, she noticed that the bedroom light and office light were on.
At around 7pm, Angel arrived in Baltimore. By then, Claudia had returned to New York. Rey's mother, Maria, and Allison's parents arrived in Baltimore soon after to help in the search. Allison called several hospitals to see if he had been checked into them as a ""John Doe"". Porter put up a reward of $1,000 for information on his whereabouts. He was also able to get the media involved in this case.
Rey's family and friends went to different places in Baltimore, including various coffee shops and restaurants, in the hopes that someone might have seen him. However, no one reported doing so. Allison noted that his credit cards were never used, his cell phone was dead, and there was no activity on their bank accounts. His loved ones feared the worst, but knew that they had to keep searching for him.
On May 22, Allison's parents decided to search for his car in several parking lots in Baltimore. They eventually found it in spot #7 in one behind a building on St. Paul Street. When found, it had a ticket on it. The parking attendant told Allison that it most likely was parked there on the evening of Rey's disappearance, as he had found it there the following morning. She could not understand why he was there.
Rey's car was found near the Belvedere, which is a historic hotel which now includes condominiums, along with restaurants, bars, and lounges. The company that he worked for, Stansberry & Associates, is also nearby. Therefore, it did not seem that unusual that he would be in that part of town. Multiple searches were conducted in the area surrounding where his car was found.
On May 24, three of Rey's coworkers decided to go to the top of the parking garage next to the Belvedere. When they looked over the edge, they spotted flip-flops on the lower roof area, near a hole in it. They immediately called the police. Officers arrived and had a manager open the door to the conference room with the hole in the roof. Inside, they found Rey's body on the floor. His family was told the news at Baltimore Police Headquarters later that day.
As Rey's family and friends mourned his death, police began to investigate it. His body was found in a prone position and was heavily decomposed. Eight days had passed from his disappearance to the discovery of his body. Despite the decomposition, the medical examiner discovered multiple fractured ribs, punctured lungs, lacerations, damage to the skull, and two fractures to the right leg. With the extent of the injuries, it appeared that he had come from great heights when he went through the roof. Investigators noticed that the hole was clean and not too large. Rey apparently fell through it vertically.
The biggest question became: where did he come from and how did he get through the hole? The first theory was that he either jumped off, fell off, or was pushed off the top roof and went through the lower one, which was about ten stories down. The top one was an approximately forty-foot open area. However, there are several different structures there, such as air conditioning units and air ducts. There was approximately forty-five feet between the edge of the roof and the hole.
Detective Michael Baier felt that it would have been virtually impossible for Rey to have made the jump, especially in flip-flops. Allison recalled that he was very afraid of heights and would have been scared to be up on the roof as there was no railing. She could find no reason for him to be up there. Baier did not believe that he had jumped from the roof.
The second theory was that Rey jumped from the parking garage where his coworkers had discovered the hole. The distance from the garage to it was about twenty feet. The height from the lower roof to the garage was also about twenty feet. Baier felt that a jump from the garage into the roof would have been survivable. Also, he did not believe that the injuries to Rey's body matched with a fall from that height. As a result, he ruled out this theory.
The third theory was that Rey fell from a ledge on the eleventh floor. The ledge wraps around the building. However, he could only access it by going through either an office or someone's condo. Also, the windows were ""half windows"" which barely opened at all. Furthermore, the ledge was small and it would have been difficult to maneuver it without falling off of it. Due to the conflicting evidence, it has not been determined where he exactly fell from.
During the investigation of the hole in the roof, Rey's cell phone was found. Strangely, there was little damage to it and it still worked. His glasses were found nearby. They also had little damage to them. WBAL-TV reporter Jayne Miller became interested in this case and reported on it several times. She felt it was strange that his cell phone and glasses had little damage despite the force that was needed to push him through the roof. Also on it were his flip-flops; one was broken while the other was not. Allison noticed what appeared to be drag marks on one. Baier believed that the evidence on the roof was staged. Rey's money clip was not found on his body. He usually kept his money, identification, and other items in it. They have never been recovered.
Investigative journalist Stephen Janis looked into Rey's death. He asked several people at the hotel if they had seen him or heard anything that night. However, no one reported seeing him or hearing anything. Angel tried to recreate Rey's movements that night. He tried to walk through the lobby and upstairs to the roof. However, he does not believe that Rey would have been able to do this without being noticed or stopped.He noted that there are several back stairways and hallways that he would have had to navigate through before reaching the roof. Jayne noted that the door to the roof area was usually locked. It appeared that he would have had to know how to get there beforehand.
Baier checked the cameras to the hotel but could find no trace of Rey. Unfortunately, the one on the roof was disconnected. According to Baier, no one could give him any indication that Rey was in the building that night. There were no witnesses or phone calls that placed him there. Despite the inconsistencies in this case, the Baltimore police ruled his death a suicide.
Rey's family and friends do not believe that he committed suicide. Angel noted that he was not under any mental duress or psychoactive medications. Allison felt that they were in a very happy point in their lives. She claimed that he wanted to start a family with her. Jayne did not believe that there was any evidence that suggested he wanted to commit suicide.
Allison met with the medical examiner who was involved in this case. The examiner said that they were not planning to close it, despite the police department's ruling. The examiner told her that the way his shins were broken was not consistent with a fall. However, they would not say how they believed the injuries actually occurred. Based on the inconsistencies in this case, the examiner declared the manner of death as ""undetermined"". This meant that they did not have enough evidence to determine if his death was a suicide, accident, or murder.
While Rey was still missing, Allison was searching through their house when she found a note taped to the back of the computer in their office. It text was shrunk down to a very small font size. She determined that it had been written on the day of his disappearance because there were scraps of it in the trash can. It said, in part: Brothers and Sisters, Right now, around the world, volcanos are erupting. What an awesome sight...whom virtue unites, death will not separate.
The note had different names on it, such as movie star and family ones. Baier considered it to be ""very unusual"". Allison noted that there was an entire page which listed people that he knew. However, some important people in his life were not included. There was also a list of movies that ""stuck with him"". Allison did not understand what the note meant as a whole. In it, he continued: I stand before you a man who understands the purpose and value of our secrets. That's why I cherish them as secrets.
Allison decided to take the first sentence from the note and do a Google search on it. The first thing that came up had to do with the Freemasons. She noted that Rey was curious about secret societies such as them. She suspected that he may have been wanting to do a screenplay about them. Jayne felt that the note was cryptic and may have been written in code. In it, he also stated: That was a well-played game. Congratulations, to all who participated.
Rey was known as a prolific writer and he wrote a great amount of stuff in different places. Allison recalled that he would often write about many different things on the same page of paper that would not make sense to anyone but him. The note continued: Life is a test to see if you can control your spirit. Take care and enjoy the festivities. Allison immediately gave it to the police, who then sent it to an FBI lab. The lab determined that it, while unusual, was not a suicide note. Allison also does not believe that it was so.
Another bizarre aspect of this case was Rey's abrupt departure from his home on the day of his disappearance. He did not take much with him on that day. It appeared that whatever sent him to the Belvedere seemed to happen in a hurry. Claudia recalled to Allison how she heard him answer the phone from his office and then quickly run down the stairs and leave the house without explanation. The phone conversation was brief and ended with the exclamation ""Oh."" The police traced it and determined that it had come from Stansberry & Associates. However, there was no way to determine who made it because it came from a switchboard and they could not track down the extension.
Once Rey's body was found and police tried to question Stansberry employees, the company put a gag order on the whole staff. They were not allowed to talk to police, according to the company lawyers. Porter did not return calls from the police and has not spoken about this case since the discovery of Rey's body. Baier believed that this was suspicious. Allison felt similarly; she did not understand why he would not want to talk to anyone about Rey's death.
At the time of Rey's disappearance, he was a freelance videographer for Stansberry & Associates, producing documentaries and videos of conferences. Prior to that, he was working on a newsletter called the ""Rebound Report"" which gives the reader stock tips to buy stocks that are currently not doing well but will rebound in the future. Before he came to Baltimore, Porter put out a letter under a firm called Pirate Investors that touted the investment in a Russian firm that planned to discover Uranium. However, the tip did not work out and investors complained.
Subsequently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (or SEC) filed fraud charges against Porter and fined him approximately $1.5 million. The company claimed that it was their First Amendment right to give the advice about the Russian firm. However, according to the SEC, the advice was fraudulent. According to Allison, one of the reasons Rey came to Baltimore was to help ""clean up"" Porter and the company's reputation in response to the fraud allegations.
About two weeks before Rey's death, Allison noticed that something was worrying him. She did not think much of it at the time. However, at 1am on Monday, May 15, the day before he vanished, the house alarm went off. When she went to investigate, he came quickly out of another room with a baseball bat. She noticed that he was extremely frightened by the alarm. This concerned her because he normally was not afraid of anything.
The police came out to investigate the alarm. However, they told Allison that a squirrel had probably triggered it. The following Tuesday at 1am, it went off again. She noticed that the window, which was on the ground floor, had been tampered with. She believes that someone was trying to get into their house. She also believes that the incidents were connected to Rey's death.
Allison believes that Rey found some kind of information that he was not supposed to find and was murdered because of it. However, she does not know what information he would have uncovered that would have led to him being killed over it. Meanwhile, Angel believes that his death was money-related. He suspects that someone lost a lot of money because of his ""Rebound Report"" and killed him over it. Jayne also believes that foul play was involved in his death and does not believe he committed suicide.
Baier cautioned Allison about investigating Rey's death and believed that she may be in danger of the same people that allegedly killed him. He believed that he was the only homicide detective involved in this case that did not believe his death was a suicide. He believes that there is enough evidence to investigate it as a homicide. However, three weeks into the investigation, he was reassigned.
The Baltimore Police Department continues to insist that Rey committed suicide. However, the medical examiner still considers the case ""open"". Baier believes that someone Rey worked with may have information that could help solve this case. His family is still hoping for a resolution to this case.
Suspects: Porter is considered a possible suspect in Rey's death. Prior to his death, he had worked on a report that involved a stock tip about a Russian firm. It did not work out and investors complained. The SEC became involved and accused Stansberry & Associates of fraud. Rey's family believes that these allegations may have had something to do with his death.
On the night Rey disappeared, he received a call from someone at Stansberry & Associates. He left his home immediately after. The caller's identity remains unknown.
After Rey's body was found, a gag order was reportedly placed on all of the employees at Stansberry & Associates. As a result, they were not allowed to talk to the police about this case. Porter has not spoken to police about it since then. His family suspects that Porter may have been involved.
Angel also suspects that Rey may have been murdered by someone who lost money because of the bogus stock tip.
Extra Notes:

This case was first released on July 1, 2020 as a part of the first volume of the Netflix reboot of Unsolved Mysteries.
Porter Stansberry declined requests to be interviewed for this case.
Results: Unsolved. As a result of the broadcast, several tips were received about this case. However, it is not known if these tips have led to anything substantial. One online theory that has been brought up by a viewer involves one of the movies that Rey mentioned in his note: The Game. In it, the main character jumps off of a roof and crashes through a glass ceiling. There has been speculation that Rey may have tried to recreate this scene, leading to his death. This has not been confirmed.
There is some evidence not included in the broadcast that supports the theory of suicide. The FBI released a report stating that they believed Rey suffered from bipolar disorder. He and Allison were reportedly not happy with living in Baltimore. He also had been to the Belvedere several times before his death. Furthermore, he was friends with two bartenders who worked at a bar located on the thirteenth floor. They would often take smoke breaks on the roof; this suggested that he would have known how to access the roof of the hotel.
Mikita Brottman, who lived in the hotel at the time of Rey's death, wrote a book about this case. According to her, multiple people there had heard a loud ""bang"" sound on the night of his death, despite reports saying no one heard anything. After his death, she tried multiple times to access the roof area, and only on one occasion was the door locked. Furthermore, a physicist determined that, if he was running at eleven miles per hour, he could have jumped from the roof and landed in the spot where his body was found.

1qzjuo3,https://tipstor.com/san-francisco-long-weekend-itinerary/,San Francisco Long Weekend Itinerary,"Create a San Francisco Long Weekend Itinerary? The answer begins where the fog rolls in like a theatrical curtain and the city rises in layers of hills, sourdough perfume, and the distant clang of cable cars climbing toward the sky. San Francisco is not a place that tolerates timid schedules. It demands a long weekend lived with appetite, curiosity, and a willingness to wander until the streets themselves start telling you where to go next.

The first morning belongs to the waterfront, where the bay glitters like polished steel and the smell of fresh coffee drifts from cafés along the Embarcadero. Ferry Building Marketplace hums with bakers pulling warm loaves from ovens, oyster counters stacking crushed ice, and farmers laying out produce bright enough to look painted. Breakfast here is not rushed. It’s a slow ceremony of pastries, fruit, and strong coffee while ferries slide across the water like patient giants. A walk north leads to Fisherman’s Wharf and Pier 39, where sea lions lounge with the confidence of longtime residents, and the breeze carries the unmistakable scent of clam chowder served in hollowed sourdough bowls.

Afternoons are built for hills. A cable car rattling toward Nob Hill turns transportation into theater, every turn revealing rooftops, steeples, and flashes of the Pacific in the distance. Chinatown waits just beyond, alive with red lanterns, herbal shops, and bakeries displaying glossy roast duck and delicate egg tarts. Lunch becomes an exploration—dumplings steaming in bamboo baskets, noodles stretched by hand, tea poured with quiet precision. From there, North Beach offers espresso bars and old-school Italian bakeries where cannoli shells crack like applause.

Day two belongs to the Golden Gate Bridge, best experienced in the soft morning light when the towers glow against the drifting fog. Walking or cycling across the span feels like stepping into a postcard that somehow stayed real. On the far side, Sausalito spreads along the shoreline with waterfront restaurants, seafood platters, and relaxed cafés where the bay reflects the afternoon sun. The ferry ride back provides a cinematic return, the skyline rising ahead like a promise kept. Evening calls for the Mission District, where murals stretch across entire buildings and taquerias serve burritos legendary enough to spark friendly debate across the city.

The final day unfolds in Golden Gate Park, a green kingdom of gardens, museums, and winding paths where locals jog, picnic, and drift through the morning with practiced ease. Nearby neighborhoods such as Haight-Ashbury offer vintage shops, record stores, and colorful Victorian houses that seem lifted from another era. As the weekend winds down, the Pacific coastline at Ocean Beach delivers the closing scene—waves rolling in steady rhythm, the sky painted with sunset colors, and the city behind you humming with the quiet satisfaction of a place that never runs out of stories.

A long weekend in San Francisco is not about checking landmarks off a list. It is about tasting the city, hill by hill, neighborhood by neighborhood, letting the fog guide the pace and the food guide the direction. Three days here feel expansive, vibrant, and endlessly alive, a compact adventure where every street corner offers another reason to stay just a little longer.

1qzjtxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExecutiveAssistants/comments/1qzjtxb/business_owner_brought_her_husband_to_the/,Business owner brought her husband to the interview,"I had an initial interview for an EA/Office Manager role at a small interior design firm that went really well. My first interview was with a business consultant brought on to help the firm grow and succeed and he seemed to really like me and set up a coffee chat with the owner of the company. 

I looked up the owner of the company to see that they were a woman, possibly very wealthy, and was looking forward to meet with a woman in leadership.

  
I show up at the coffee shop and she brings her wealthy husband with her to participate in the interview, even though he doesn’t even work at her company and works somewhere else. She let him lead the entire interview and barely spoke, which made me very uncomfortable. He doesn’t even work there and was domineering the entire conversation and seemed a bit unpleasant. 



Not only that, they are replacing the person currently in the position, which I have found to be a red flag more than not. Just shaking off the weird vibes of that interview, have never had something like that happen before. ",5,1770582460.0,ExecutiveAssistants,3,1.0,False

He won’t talk to me until I apologize and admit that I’m “selfish” because I told him that I didn’t want to spend next Christmas with him.



Backstory: I’ve been with my boyfriend for 4 years. I started spending Christmas with him and his family three years ago when my parents moved to Hawaii. With my family, I’ve only been used to secret Santa christmases where everyone just gets one gift but everyone feels included. My boyfriend’s family on the other hand are huge gift givers. I’m talking PS5s, cars, Louis Vuitton bags, the works. Everyone gets several $1000s in gifts. The whole of Christmas morning features me opening my one or two gifts and then it’s spent watching my bf and his sisters open their 20+ gifts each for 2 hours. My bf has two older sisters who also have bfs. 



The Christmas before last, me and the sisters’ bfs complained to each other about how awful it makes us feel. Like poor beggars watching a rich family have a gluttonous feast. We kind of just have to sit there in silence as we watch each of them open up amazing gifts meanwhile we just each have gifts from our respective partners and their mom. 



That Christmas braved up and told my bf how I felt and he apologized saying he’d make next Christmas (2025) better.



This past Christmas was the worst. One of his older sisters got a new car and my bf got a watch from Versace (there were other crazy expensive gifts in there too). I got gifts for everyone, his mom, dad, two sisters, both boyfriends, and my bf. All I got in return was loose Keurig cups in a random amazon box from his mom and that’s it. I don’t even have a Keurig. I don’t even drink coffee. (Funniest part is that before I opened my gift his sisters said they pitched in, they’re literally pushing 30 with adult jobs and had to “pitch in” for kcups? Ok lmfao…)



My boyfriend told me his gift was coming in the following week. The other S/Os got multiple well-thought-out gifts from their gfs and I was just sitting there with my loose kcups that I can’t even use. I excused myself to the bathroom that morning and just drove home crying.



I felt disrespected and forgotten at Christmas. I don’t want to feel that way again. EVER. Which is why I brought up not spending next Christmas together a couple of days ago to my bf. I told him I would rather be alone in my apartment than spend Christmas with his family, bc frankly, I hate spending Christmas with them. I’ll admit I did go a bit far bc I called them selfish assholes (which is the main reason he won’t talk to me). He told me that I'm just jealous bc his family can afford to give gifts like that and obviously they won't for me bc I'm not family and that I'd get expensive gifts from him when we graduate and get jobs. That's not why I'm upset tho? I'll admit that I am jealous of the expensive gifts, but who wouldn't be when they're flaunted in front of you?? I just want to know that I'm also thought of. I don't like feeling left out. It's awful.

1qzjpsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1qzjpsm/struggling_to_make_friends/,Struggling to make friends,"My partner (27m) and I (27f) don’t really have any friends, and we’re struggling to understand why. We’re social people and we genuinely enjoy meeting others. We go for coffees, walks, spend time in our local village at the weekends, and we have hobbies like running, racket sports, gaming, and writing.

Over the years, we’ve met a lot of people and come close to forming friendships, but it never seems to develop into anything solid or lasting. A recent example is another couple we met — we were meeting up semi-regularly for coffee and walks, and it felt like it was naturally heading towards a friendship. Then they slowly started rejecting plans and making excuses for around seven weeks, until we eventually took the hint and backed off. That was effectively the end of the friendship, and we haven’t heard from them since.

This has left us wondering whether people are genuinely interested in having real friendships anymore, and what friendship even looks like nowadays. Do close, fulfilling friendships still exist in the way they used to? Or has friendship become something more casual, occasional, or convenience-based?

What we’re hoping for doesn’t feel unreasonable — friends who stay lightly in touch over text, but who also want to meet up every couple of weeks and actually build something. Right now, though, it feels a bit like we’re chasing a version of friendship that doesn’t really exist anymore.

We do try. We initiate plans, make an effort to be kind and helpful, and we’re mindful about giving people space and allowing them to reach out too. Despite that, it never seems to progress beyond surface-level connection.

For additional context, I’ve recently become distant from my previous best friend because I was always the one reaching out and getting very little in return. My partner is in a similar position — he doesn’t really have friends either and has noticed growing distance with his best friend from childhood. There was no big fallout; the relationship has just gradually faded over time. We’re also new parents, which we know can complicate things socially.

We know that now we’re parents, friendships aren’t always going to be the top priority — and we’re realistic about that. But we’re still genuinely interested in making friends, both as a couple and individually, and it often feels like the people we meet just aren’t in the same headspace. It sometimes feels like we’re the only ones actively trying, which is a bit of a shame (and slightly baffling).

We have wondered whether we might be the problem. We try to be nice, but we’re aware it’s possible we just aren’t that likeable. That said, for the purpose of advice, we’d really appreciate it being based on the assumption that we’re “okay enough” people — in case this is more about how friendships work now, rather than something fundamentally wrong with us 😂

I think what we’re really asking is:

Are people still interested in building genuine friendships, and do friendships still feel as fulfilling as they once did? Or has the nature of friendship changed more than we’ve realised?",1,1770582205.0,Vent,1,1.0,False
1qzjp1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_JSD_Artistic_Edits/comments/1qzjp1a/chatgpt_vs_gemini/,ChatGPT vs Gemini,"All of last year, I was doing a little experiement, trying out different AI Image Generators, a few at time for a few months at a time. For most of the year, ChatGPT was my favorite, and I kept that subscription for the longest. When they updated to GPT5, I started to hate the changes, and switched to using mostly Gemini. And with the drop of Nano Banana, I have never been happier. Gemini is fantastic with image editing!

But there is one thing I sometimes miss with ChatGPT, and that is how much more personable it **can** be. Sure, when I am actually working, I instruct my model to be ""all-business"", but when I am just doing personal projects, it can be fun to let the AI have a personality! But Gemini is a total dud... a soulless robot.

I tried a recent trend today, asking your AI to create a caricature of you, based on everything it knows about you. Before I share the results, here is a photo of me, and yes, **both** AI bots have seen photos of me before. I am overweight, have short, purple and teal hair, and am usually wearing one or both colors, (almost always dresses) plus matching glasses. What I do primarily is digital image editing, with an emphasis on turning photos into something artistic. I am also an admitted ""crazy cat lady"", and I love working on pet-related images in general.

I berated Gemini, and asked, ""Do you even know who I am or what I do? None of this has anything to do with me!"" And it proceeded to give me a perfectly accurate description of me, despite the fact it had totally failed at making the image match. WTF?

I ridiculed it, and told it ChatGPT did a better job, and demanded it try again. Only after this browbeating did it finally present me with a more acceptable option, which is admitedly more true-to-life and accurate (tho I do appreciate how much more shapely ChatGPT made me, ROFL). It did go a bit overboard with the repetition... I mean, how many books, cups of coffee and tablet pens do I need on my desk at one time?

For background: we started dating when I was 17 and he was 16. We dated seriously for about 2 years, followed by a messy 2–3 year on-and-off situationship. The relationship was toxic, and eventually I walked away. Shortly after, he jumped straight into a new relationship, which resulted in a child.  
Side note: our families are close, and his best friend is my cousin, so we’ve never fully been out of each other’s orbit.

Over the years, I’ve done a lot of healing. At the time, all I wanted was a future and a family, but life didn’t work out that way. I focused on finishing university and recently qualified through my current employer in my field. I’ve stayed busy and independent. I’ve dated since him, but none of those relationships stuck — mostly because I’m very headstrong and future-focused, and I struggle with men who have no direction or ambition.

Jeff works overseas and only sees his daughter (now 2) twice a year. Last year, while he was away, he and his girlfriend broke up. She never liked me — openly hostile at times — and she knew Jeff and I were still involved when they first met. A few months after the breakup, she got engaged and is now pregnant.

After Jeff and his ex split, we reconnected — strictly as friends. We talk every day. If I mention a guy I’m seeing, he’ll give honest feedback (for example, pointing out when someone clearly isn’t interested in a relationship). When I’m dealing with family issues, he’s supportive and grounded. Our conversations are realistic, not flirty, and I genuinely value his advice.

When he came home recently, we barely spoke during the first week, which I understood — family, his daughter, responsibilities. He eventually reached out again but never followed through on the “plans” he mentioned before arriving.

I’ve also become friends with his younger brother’s ex-girlfriend, Chloe (21F). We hang out, go for lunches and drinks, and have bonding smoke sessions. In February, it was his brother’s birthday, and Chloe invited me to go with her for moral support. I messaged Jeff beforehand to ask if it was okay. He said it was.

At the party, his family was genuinely happy to see me — his aunt and sister especially. Jeff greeted me with a side hug. This was also the first time I met his daughter. I acknowledged her calmly and respectfully without making a fuss — she’s innocent in all of this.

As the night went on, I played party games with the girls, while Jeff disappeared. At one point he watched us for a few minutes, then went and sat alone on some steps.

The next day, I checked in with him to see if he was okay. He said he was still feeling the effects of a supplement he and my cousin had taken over the weekend, which explained his distant behavior. I suggested we grab a coffee or drink sometime because the whole interaction felt strange, given how close we are now.

That same Thursday, he asked if I wanted to get infused coffee (weed). I agreed. When I arrived, he told me his dad had just called and booked a house viewing for him. Since we were nearby, he went in alone while I waited in the car.

After that, we decided to park by the sea, smoke, and chat — except we didn’t have a lighter. We drove to a corner shop, then decided to go smoke at the beachfront. I warned him not to drive onto the soft sand. He didn’t listen. The car got badly stuck.

What was supposed to be a casual coffee turned into us stranded on the beach. He had to call my cousin to come help us. Despite the chaos, we laughed and talked — but something felt off. We barely made eye contact. When we did, it lasted only seconds. After months of daily communication, why did it feel so awkward in person?

When my cousin and another friend arrived, I sat on the sand watching storm clouds roll in while Jeff explained the situation. Once the car was freed, a storm hit — pouring rain, darkness, no streetlights, both back tires flat. I was extremely anxious, close to a panic attack.

All I could think was: *What would my family say if something happened? I was driving in a storm with my ex.*  
We made it home safely — but the whole night felt like a warning sign.

Now I’m left wondering:  
Are we genuinely just friends?  
Is this unresolved emotional baggage?  
Or are we both clinging to familiarity because it feels safe?

I don’t want to romanticize something that already hurt me once — but I also don’t want to ignore my intuition",1,1770581998.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False
