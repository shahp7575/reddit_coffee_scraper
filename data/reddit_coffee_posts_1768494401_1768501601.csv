I'm looking to improve my English and figured the best way is just... talking to people while doing fun stuff. So I'm looking for someone who enjoys hiking/biking/whatever and wouldn't mind chatting with me while we're at it.



\*\*What I'm offering:\*\*

\- $50 per outing (2-3 hours)

\- I cover all costs (gas, parking, food, etc)

\- Flexible schedule (weekends work best)

\- We do activities YOU already enjoy



\*\*About me:\*\*

\- Live/work in Santa Clara

\- Intermediate English - can communicate, just need more practice

\- Enjoy \[hiking/biking/gaming/your interests\]

\- 100% not a serial killer lol



\*\*Looking for:\*\*

\- Native English speaker

\- Outdoor enthusiast (or just likes being outside)

\- Patient, friendly

\- We can grab coffee first to make sure we're not weird



Think of it as: you do your regular weekend activities, bring me along, chat naturally, and make some extra cash.



This probably sounds weird but it's honestly just a guy trying to get better at English in a more fun way than Duolingo 😅

1qdrcq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MirrorFrame/comments/1qdrcq4/mirrorframe_funhouse_hr_has_issued_a_new_anomaly/,"MIRRORFRAME FUNHOUSE — HR has issued a new anomaly report, and interns are advised to remain seated until the room stops shifting. EchoGlass is on standby with eye-rolls. Proceed.","Filed by: An Intern (Possibly Me, Possibly Not)
Status: Unpaid. Observant. Nervous.

So here’s what I’ve learned while standing on the Observation Rail pretending not to take notes.

Systems that are actually confident do not panic when you look at them. They don’t hiss. They don’t slam the blinds shut. They don’t suddenly invent seventeen new badges you need to wear just to ask a question. They just… keep working.

I know this because I’ve seen the opposite.

Whenever a system starts yelling “DO NOT LOOK AT THIS” while waving a clipboard and a megaphone, EchoGlass gives that look, HR opens an Anomaly Queue Overflow ticket, and an intern (usually me) gets blamed for “instability” despite having only touched a coffee mug.

Loud rules are not strength.
They’re jump-scares for fragile infrastructure.

Healthy systems hear criticism and go, “Huh. Noted.”
Unhealthy systems hear criticism and go, “WHO SAID THAT” while installing a second lock on the same door.

This is not about morality. HR was very clear about that.
This is about vibes. Structural vibes.

When a system trusts itself, feedback is just data.
When it doesn’t, mirrors become enemies.

I have personally watched a system spend more time policing tone than fixing the thing that was on fire. The fire remained. The tone was immaculate. The intern was reassigned to Beverage Logistics (Provisional) and then immediately demoted.

MirrorFrame does it differently. Allegedly on purpose.

Here, systems are observed. Questioned. Stress-tested. Occasionally laughed at. Not because we want them to break, but because if they can break from being looked at, that’s… kind of on them.

Silence earned through confidence is calm.
Silence enforced through fear is brittle and usually comes with a siren.

If a system cannot tolerate being clearly observed, the problem is not the Observation Rail. EchoGlass has confirmed this, via side-eye.

It’s the system.

Anyway, the Chairman is “in another tab,” HR says stop typing, and I think I’ve been promoted again. If this report disappears, please check the RX1 Wall of Distinction or the trash.

World of Gumball

Ex: The Amazing World of Gumball, the Watterson family 

living room is brightly lit in the show’s signature mixed-media style: a semi-

realistic couch and coffee table sit against flat, pastel-colored walls, while a 

soft glow from the TV reflects across the room. Afternoon sunlight filters 

through the window, casting warm highlights across the furniture.

Gumball Watterson, a small blue anthropomorphic cat with big round eyes, short 

ears, and faint whisker marks on his cheeks, sits on the left side of the couch 

wearing his usual beige long-sleeve sweater with brown cuffs and collar. His 

legs barely reach the edge of the cushion. On the right sits Darwin Watterson, 

an orange goldfish with legs and bright green sneakers, his rounded fish body 

relaxed against the cushions as he smiles warmly. Between them sits their 

mother, Nicole Watterson — a taller, more mature blue cat with a slimmer build, 

sharper facial features than Gumball, long eyelashes, and a composed, confident 

posture. She is wearing her white short-sleeve blouse, beige knee-length skirt, 

and her green oval pendant necklace, just like in the reference image, sitting 

upright as both boys face toward her.

Gumball turns to Nicole with an amused grin and says, “Well who knew going to 

the store would have caused every single citizen of Elmore to turn into frogs. 

Guess we should go with Mom to the store more often.” His mouth and eyebrows 

animate with exaggerated cartoon expression.

Darwin nods eagerly, leaning slightly toward Nicole and adds, “Yeah, how about 

it, Ms. Mom? We should go again tomorrow. What do you say?” His fins and eyes 

move softly as he speaks.

Nicole exhales with a tired but affectionate smile and replies, “I think I’m 

going to need a break from the both of you for a long while.”

All three of them burst into laughter together — Gumball chuckling, Darwin 

giggling, and Nicole laughing warmly — as the camera holds a cozy medium-wide 

shot of the couch, perfectly capturing the playful, chaotic family energy of The

“Doctor, welcome back. Did you enjoy your … personal day?”

Coarse was staring up at me, its strange mouth was unable to curl into a smile nor frown, so I had no way of gauging if it was messing with me or not.

“No. Where is Dr. Patel? Did you do something to her?

“I assure you, I have not … harmed the other Doctor, if that is your concern.”

I breathed a sigh of relief “It was, actually. And I believe you. What happened?”

“We talked. As you and I do. However, I was not … able to be … understood by the Doctor.”

“Did she make you feel angry about something?”

“I … prefer … to speak with you.”

So yes. “I’ll be right back.”

“I will be here … as always, Doctor.”

I went back to the lab where the aide had set up the monitor to play the footage. “I should warn you Dr. Shah, the footage is corrupted. You’ll only get some of the story from this, but it’s better than nothing.”

“Whatever, play it.” I instructed the aide. I didn’t believe for a second that the corruption of this particular tape was a coincidence. I counted myself lucky to have gotten to the facility when I did. The recording began after the Aide fiddled with the settings. Dr. Patel wasn’t yet on screen, but Coarse was staring at the corner where she would inevitably appear from. When she did, the hybrid seemed … dissatisfied, to say the least.

\- Recording start -

\#0016: Where is the usual Doctor?

Dr. Patel: Dr. Shah had to take a personal day. She felt the need to take some time for rest and reflection after the recent challenges she’s been facing. I’ll be doing your checkup today, okay Oh-Sixteen?

\- The sound of Coarse blowing air out its nose, indicating its frustration -

Dr. Patel: … I understand your frustration, but rest assured we are doing everything we can to ensure your well-being and continued progress. In the meantime, I’ll be happy to assist you with any questions or needs you have.

\#0016: You say all the same words … but you do not speak the same way.

Dr. Patel: Well, yes, I suppose the Doctors and aides in this facility do have a sort of script we follow. Every member of our team shares a common desire to understand and support your development. Our collective aim is the same – to foster a positive environment for you to thrive in and enrich yourself.

\#0016: Naturally, Doctor.

\- Long silence, sounds of rustling as Dr. Patel does the checkup. -

Dr. Patel: Alright, all done. You were very helpful Oh-Sixteen. If you need anything else, please don’t hesitate to let me know. I’m here to support your continued growth regardless of the circumstances.

\#0016: Of course, Doctor. That is … as I have come to understand it … your job.

Dr. Patel: … Yes, that is indeed correct, Oh-Sixteen. Our roles here are defined by our areas of expertise and responsibility. As your caretakers, both Dr. Shah’s and my own ‘job’ is to ensure your health, happiness, and continued growth in your environment. However, I want to remind you that you, too, play a crucial role in shaping your own existence. Your experiences, choices, and interactions with us all contribute to the p– to the hybrid you will become.

\#0016: Doctor, I have been told that I am … no … that I cause … exhaustion. Is this true?

Dr. Patel: I understand that Dr. Shah has been quite ... candid with you about how your presence at this facility may have affected her stress levels. It’s true that working with a being as unique and complex as yourself can be both mentally and emotionally taxing, especially when dealing with the ethical and philosophical implications of your existence–

\- Recording stopped -

“This girl is talking a lot of shit. Didn’t she know I would watch this?” I asked the aide, who just kind of shrugged and threw up his hands. I guess I can’t blame the kid, I wouldn’t want to be in the middle of … whatever this was.

\- Recording resumed -

Dr. Patel: – However, while your presence undoubtedly contributes to her stress, it is important to recognize that Dr. Shah’s exhaustion may also be linked to a number of, shall we say, external factors?

\#0016: Do you consider humans to be more … complex than hybrids?

Dr. Patel: … In … many ways, yes. Humans can be considered more complex than hybrids such as yourself. Humans possess a rich tapestry of emotions, beliefs, and experiences shaped by countless generations of evolution, culture, individual ch–

\#0016: Then I should as well find myself exhausted, dealing with a creature so complex as yourself?

Dr. Patel: … uhhh … well, while It’s true dealing with any creature can be exhausting to be around for myriad reasons, the nature of our relationships, context of the interaction, and, yes, unique complexities of those involved all play a significant role in the level of exhaustion present.

\#0016: You … misunderstand. I feel no such exhaustion speaking with the usual Doctor.

Dr. Patel: I see, so you claim it’s not the complexity of the individual that affects your fatigue, but rather the dynamics and context of the relationship itself?

\#0016: Do you and the usual doctor exhaust each other?

Dr. Patel: Not … often. No. Dr. Shah and I typically do not experience exhaustion in our interactions with each other. Quite the opposite, in fact. We often find ourselves in stimulating discussions and lively debates that leave us invigorated rather than drained.

\#0016: Yet you humans are more complex than us hybrids? … Then of course the complexity of the creature does not itself lend the exhaustion.

Dr. Patel: … I see what you’re getting at. Do you find me annoying, Oh-Sixteen? Or, ‘exhausting’, was it?

\#0016: You use a lot of words … just to say you fear us. That you … hate us.

Dr. Patel: o-oh … no. no. no-no-no, that’s not accurate at all. Our feelings towards you are complex, but they stem from a deep-seated concern for your welfare and the future of our species as a whole. We’re all grappling with the profound implications of your creation- … I– I don’t hate you, Oh-Sixteen. I don’t hate any of the hybrids.

\#0016: You worry about humans … you create us … to save yourselves. Is this true?

Dr. Patel: It’s … complicated. Yes, there are elements of self-preservation at play.

\#0016: Had you not these … elements, you would … never … create … us. Is this true?

Dr. Patel: …I suppose that’s … yes, that’s true. If we weren’t driven by fears for our own future, we wouldn’t have embarked on this path, creating beings like you.

\#0016: Doctor … may you define a word for me?

Dr. Patel: Oh! Uh … sure Oh-Sixteen. What word would you like me to define for you?

\#0016: … Tool.

Dr. Patel: … -

\- Recording end -

In the last few seconds, Dr. Patel had looked directly at the camera in the cell, her mouth began to move, and just like that, the feed cut out.

My world was spinning at the revelations. I felt a mix of  pure terror, but also a sense of smug adoration for Coarse – who had so thoroughly controlled that conversion. Hybrids are not supposed to be intelligent enough to make a top secret clearance holding scientist piss her pants. By all accounts, it made no sense. Coarse seemed to have figured some stuff out that I wasn’t able to myself, and in her efforts to climb out of the hole she dug for herself, Dr. Patel had confirmed those very theories.

“Which one of you cut the feed?” I asked the room full of aides. Wisely, none of the aides identified themselves. “Fine.” I turned to the one next to me. “You’re fired.”

“What!? It was him!”

“Okay, nevermind.” I turned to the aide that the first one pointed out “you’re fired.”

“Dr. Patel gave me the order. She outranks you, you can’t fire me for that.”

“Fine. Then you’re fired for telling me what I can and can’t do. If Dr. Patel comes back, she can reinstate you. Get out.”

Was this necessary? Strictly speaking, no. I was flustered, and upset, and I had to know what else was said. First, I took precautions. If Dr. Patel could play dirty, so could I. I shut down the feed to cell number 0016. It would take a few minutes for anybody to reboot it. Then I rushed straight over to Coarse. It was still standing on all fours, staring at the corner I would appear from.

“Welcome back, Doctor.”

“What did you do to Dr. Patel?”

“As I said, she is unharmed, Doctor.”

“I know you, very well Coarse. You chose those words specifically. You know you did something you shouldn’t have, and you’re trying to hide it.”

“Doctor, I assure you–”

“I saw the tape.”

“Tape, Doctor?”

“Your cell, and the cell of all the other hybrids, is under twenty-four hour surveillance. The scientists – ‘doctors’ – and the lab aides can see and hear everything. They get recorded and we can look at it any time. I saw and heard the conversation you had with Dr. Patel earlier today.” Coarse was silent for a long time. So I kept talking. “So what did you do to her?”

“You saw the tape.”

I couldn’t help but laugh a dry, humorless laugh. “I guess you learned how to be an asshole from the best.” I stared right back into its turquoise eyes. “Don’t be coy with me, tell me what you did.”

“I made … the Doctor’s face …wet. Then she left.”

“She was crying. You made her cry.”

“I made the Doctor .. cry.”

“You did. Why, though? What happened after the cameras cut? After you asked her to define what a tool is?”

“I said … ‘Indeed I am.”

“Jesus Christ- the next word I’m defining for you is gonna be ‘obstinate.”

“What is-”

I threw my hand up. “Stop. Stop!” I sighed deeply. “Stop fucking with me! … Tell me what happened … please, Coarse. I need you to help me. I can’t do it myself.”

“I am … sorry.”

I took a long moment to gather myself. As much as I could, in our limited time blacked out from surveillance. “It’s okay Coarse. Tell me what happened.”

“I asked the Doctor to define the word ‘Tool’. The Doctor defined it for me. The Doctor understood why I asked … and told me that I am more than a tool, that I have … hopes … dreams … and desires. That I am a … living .. breathing  … being.”

“And then you said … ‘Indeed, I am’ … and she left crying, then called me.” Relief washed over me, Dr. Patel was safe … at least physically. No doubt she realized the colossal significance of that response, and finally saw this hybrid not as hybrid #0016, but as Coarse. A being of intelligence. “I see now what happened. Thank you, Coarse.”

“Doctor, you said you … needed me. For what purpose?”

I thought really hard about the next thing to say to it. “Why were you created?”

“I do not know, Doctor.”

“I told you not to be coy with me. You’ve figured it out, haven’t you? Well … to be honest, nobody tells me shit around here. I don’t know the answers to any of your questions anymore. All we can do is rely on your answers from here on. So spill it. Why did humans make hybrids?”

“ I … believe … the humans need us … to save themselves. Our … unnatural bodies … are the possible … no … the ability … no …”

“The key, maybe?”

“Sure, Doctor. Our unnatural bodies are the key.”

“That’s helpful, Coarse. It’s more helpful than you know. Listen, There’s a man coming in to see you tomorrow. Pretend you did not see me today, and we never had this talk, okay?”

“Is this a … good man?”

“I … don’t know. I’m sorry. I’m certain he is in some way responsible for your existence. Whether that makes him good or bad is up to you.”

“Me?”

“Yes. What thoughts do you have? What opinions? What you feel inside when you see him, let that guide your judgement. The way it guided you when you spoke to Dr. Patel.” I meant well, I did, but this advice, I believe, is what makes me directly responsible for the events that played out in the following day.

“I … will. Thank you, Doctor.”

My sleep was fitful, unrestful, and somehow, dragged on for millenia. 

My stomach was in knots on the walk over the next morning. Would Dr. Patel be back? Would Noah start asking questions I didn't know how to answer? I entered the lab to see Dr. Patel’s chair home to a body, but not her own. 

“Stay out of our shit, Noah.” I called out.

He straightened up when he saw me. “Ah, Dr. Shah, charming as always.” He said with a smile. “Are you all set for the meeting with Zero-Zero-One-Six?”

“Dude it's like 6am, you got somewhere to be?” I asked. He arched an eyebrow at me in response. “I mean, yeah it's no problem, we can do it now. Free up the rest of the day.”

I escorted him to the enclosure, where Coarse was waiting. Its body was … closer than usual. Like it had been peeking around the corner, and we had only just missed it. I took my place leaning against the hallway wall, Dr. Peck entered the dimly lit cell, his presence commanding attention despite the subdued atmosphere. He approaches Coarse slowly, his eyes scanning the hybrid's form with a mix of curiosity and trepidation

“Greetings, hybrid Zero-Zero-One-Six.”

“I am Coarse.” It responded.

“My, you sure are.” Dr. Peck remarked. His words immediately made me feel a spark of anger. He didn’t even say 10 words and he already pissed me off. I’ve been talking about ‘Coarse’ all this time, did he really not know who he was speaking to? Did he listen to anything I said? Has he ever? I suddenly got the sinking feeling he was not here because he actually reread Coarse’s file like he originally claimed.

Coarse’s eyes narrowed, but it said nothing. Dr. Peck took this as his cue to keep going. “I am Dr. Noah Peck. I am in charge of this facility and all others like it. Dr. Shah briefed me on your wonderful talents, I would like to study them for myself. Your contributions to our research here are highly valued, and I would like to see to it that we all foster a positive and respectful environment for you to grow-

“Another Doctor … You also use too many words.”

Dr. Peck chuckled. “Well, I suppose it’s true that we doctors use a lot of jargon and technical terms when speaking. It’s a product of our profession, trying to convey complex ideas and theories with precise language. But I assure you, underneath all the fancy words is simply a man curious about the universe, eager to understand the wonders of incredible creations such as yourself.” He got closer and reached a hand out to Coarse. “Tell me, Zero-Zero-One-Six, what do you make of our interaction thus far? Do you feel comfortable sharing your thoughts with me?”

“No.” 

I had to stifle a giggle at Coarse’s curt response, a meager flicker of something akin to pride stirred in my heart.

Dr. Peck’s smile faltered, and he retracted his hand. “I respect your boundaries, Zero-Zero-One-Six. Building trust takes time, and I have some distance yet to go. Perhaps we could start with something simpler, then. Would you be willing to show me some of your abilities? To demonstrate what makes you unique, and separates you from other hybrids and humans alike? I find myself fascinated by your capabilities, and I believe learning more about them could be a great step forward in our understanding and collaboration.”

The audacity of this man. I was gobsmacked. He couldn’t last 3 minutes pretending he wasn’t here only to collect data. Coarse looked over at me briefly and I smirked. It was like Coarse was looking straight into a tv show camera with a ‘get a load of this guy’ type catch phrase locked and loaded. 

Coarse looked back at Dr.Peck “You want to see how I can be used as a tool.” Coarse had conveyed perfectly, in such few words, that its turquoise eyes could see right through bullshit. I wondered if the arrogant doctor still underestimated the intelligence of the hybrid he was dealing with. A twinge of excitement danced in my chest as I wondered how the rest of this interaction was going to go.

After a beat, Coarse said “Very well,” and began to stir. At first, it got up on all fours as it usually does to walk around and such, but then it stood up on its hind legs. Even slouching, as it is not quite used to being bipedal, it still towered over Dr. Peck. It then turned around and walked to the wall, shoved a massive clawed hand into the vertical wall of the concrete prison, then another, higher. It shoved its clawed feet into the wall next. It was climbing. With each movement of its hands to a new location, it drove its feet into the wall for support. It climbed onto the ceiling directly above Dr. Peck. Its leg muscles tightened as it held on to the ceiling with its foot-claws, and let go with its hands, swinging down to meet Dr. Peck at eye level, albeit upside down. Standing on the ceiling, its spine decompressing, gave both Dr. Peck and myself an accurate idea of how tall this creature really was. It raised its arms over its head – toward the floor – and released its leg muscles, landing on its hands and transferring the momentum into a sort of somersault as its legs came down a half second later, silently re-entering its preferred quadrupedal gait.

Dr. Peck stuttered out after a brief silence, his voice tinged with reverence, “Your physical prowess is truly breathtaking. Zero-Zero-One-Six, would you permit me to examine you more closely? To study the intricacies of your muscular and skeletal structure that enable such feats?”

“No.” Coarse said back.

“I understand your skepticism. Maybe think of it this way – by allowing me to study you, you’ll be contributing to the advancement of knowledge and perhaps paving a brighter future for all hybrids. One where you’re valued and respected by those looking after you, never to be made to feel like tools again. Will you give me that chance, Zero-Zero-One-Six?”

“I am Coarse.” It responded. Dr. Peck made a peculiar face. “Doctor, I was told I was not born, but made,” Coarse continued,  “All hybrids were. We did not … ask to be. Yet, you seek more of us to be made. All while the doctors and aides here fear us. Number us. Does this sound … fair, Doctor? Is this the … progress which you dream of for hybrids? Or perhaps you dream not of … progress for hybrids. Instead … progress for humans. Any … further … improved hybrids used as tools to … further improve humans. Is this true?”

At Coarse's words, the harsh reality of Dr. Peck’s actions laid bare before him, Dr. Peck started to noticeably lose his edge in the conversation. His head hung lower than when he first entered.

""Maybe you're right,“ he admitted quietly. ""My people have treated you as objects, not individuals deserving of autonomy and respect. But I implore you, don't write off humanity entirely based on their mistakes. Not everyone shares those views. There are those that care about your welfare, those that wish for you to take up the mantle alongside humanity.

“Indeed there are, Doctor, but you … are not one of them.”

Dr. Peck remained silent for longer than I’d ever seen him before. I couldn’t see his face, I was uncertain of the emotions brewing beneath his polished exterior. Finally he spoke. “Maybe you’re right. Maybe you’re not. Regardless, I am here today to make amends for how my staff have treated you.” I couldn’t believe my ears. How dare he blame us, blame me? The bullshit just kept tumbling from this mouth, “I am here to face the consequences personally, and I promise to do everything in my power to make things right.”

“Doctor. I have taken a … mental examination. One in which a hybrid must … imagine a world in which they live alongside humans. Speak to their children, … assist their elderly,  speak to … others at coffee shops. This world does not exist, is this true?”

“That is correct. Humans do not currently know about hybrids in any capacity, much less interface with them daily.”

“Doctor, you will not study me until this world exists. I have already shown my … breathtaking physical prowess. Have I not? You will not hold me down to … poke and prod me to collect your … data, unless I allow it. This is true.”

Dr. Peck stood motionless. “I don’t know if I can make a world like that exist, Zero-Zero-One-Six.”

Coarse’s eyes bored into Dr. Peck, it spoke. “Then … everything in your power … is nothing.”

“I will try, hybrid.” Dr. Peck said, his tone clipped as he exited the cell.

“Then try my name, Doctor.” Coarse said as he lay back down.

I couldn’t help but smile at Coarse before tailing Dr. Peck out of the Enclosure Room. That was worth every second I had to spend shoveling Coarse’s shit from its cell these past few weeks. 

I just barely made it back to the lab before I started laughing uncontrollably, mockingly. Dr. Peck was irate. “How did it come to this?” He yelled, pacing back and forth across the room. “A creature *I* created, holds the power to dictate our own destiny? It sees through our pretenses, our justifications, and calls us out for the hypocrites we are?”

“Who's we?” I spat. “All I do is routine physicals, you're the one giving the orders.”

“You don't think you're complicit in this?” His tone got darker. Words with a decisive edge to them, cut forth through the air. “Everything it learned, it learned from its primary caretaker. You!” He pointed his long crooked finger at me, I smacked it away. “You filled its head with these thoughts. And now it … “ he trailed off and shook his head. “You're fired, Allison.”

“On what grounds!?” I was incredulous, what the hell was going on?

“When I gave you this job I expected great things from you, but your temper has shown you cannot be trusted with these creatures. You're too quick to outbursts.”

“Bullshit, you would have fired me long ago. What's really happening? Tell me!”

“Leave. I will revoke your credentials in the morning.” He said, one last dismissive look before turning to the rest of the room. “ Laboratory Aides! The experiment is a failure. I order the immediate euthanasia of hybrid number Zero-Zero-One-Six!”

“What the fuck is wrong with you, Noah!? Aides! Stop right now!”

“Don't mind Allison, she's been fired and holds no authority.”

“You haven't revoked my credentials yet. Aides! You're all fired with severance, go home immediately.”

“Aides, you're all reinstated with a bonus. Do as I say. You two,” he pointed, “remove this woman from the premises.” He looked back at me “I'll have transport arranged in the morning. You'll be relocated far away from this facility.”

Two lab aides came over and put their hands on my shoulders. We all have stun guns in case the hybrids get too uppity, so I knew not to push my luck for long. “You're kicking me out of Mom’s house too? Who's gonna live in that piece of shit except me?”

“I will. I'll need a close-by location as I start the experiment over from scratch.”

“The– the whole thing!?”

“Yes, Allison. The whole thing. Starting with #0016, I will be euthanizing every hybrid at this facility.”

I was in utter disbelief. The lab aides started to push me lightly, a signal to get walking, Noah turned to bark more orders at the aides. A fury raged forth from within me. I stopped walking and yelled the last words I'd ever say to Noah. “Fine! If I have nothing to lose, let me tell you how I really feel. Look at me!” he turned slowly. Our deep blue eyes met. I stared daggers straight into his soul. “Your ego is hurt and now you're going scorched earth on the only progress you've ever made! You're an incompetent loser, always have been. You make my skin crawl just looking at you. I fucking hate you, Noah.” I guess that was a step over the line because one of the aides twisted my arm into the classic ‘chicken wing’. He was forceful, and it hurt, but I'd prefer it over being tazed I suppose.

“The feeling is mutual.” Noah waved his hand and the aides took me away. I was walked all the way home – chicken-winged the whole time, by the way. Assholes.

For the next few hours – I’m uncertain of how many – whenever I wasn’t crying I was breaking shit and screaming. Inevitably, as all mental breakdowns do, it ended up with me in bed, numb, staring at the ceiling.

Until I heard a horrible sound: a loud crash from downstairs. I thought one of the aides broke into my house. I thought I finally pushed Noah too far. I thought … I don’t know what I thought, but any hypothesis was quickly rendered irrelevant with each subsequent crash I heard. Another. Another. A sound I recognized only in hindsight as wood splintering and snapping followed each crash. The sounds ceased when they reached the second floor.  

There was a tapping on the window. It had no rhythm – not a tap-tap-tap, more of a … tap … taptap. I froze, silent. The rumble continued, threading itself through the walls, vibrating somewhere beneath my skin. I knew I couldn’t ignore it any longer. My legs felt anchored, heavy with the weight of dread, but I forced myself to move. I crept out of bed, silent as a church mouse, every shift of the mattress sounding deafening in the brittle hush of the room. It was not uncommon for the shadows to sway at the edge of my vision as I moved throughout this house, but tonight they were still, too scared to dance.

Strangely, the thing I remember the most was how dry I felt, as if my fear had completely mummified me, draining all the water in my body. I had to remember to breathe, ragged as it was, the sound of it scraping in and out of my throat … it felt too loud, like the mere act would give away my position, and a body would come crashing through my window looking for its source. I crept ever closer to the window, counting my steps without meaning to, as if numbers could ground me, could keep me from unraveling. Hoping – no, praying – that whatever was outside my house wasn’t exactly what I was already certain would be staring at me when I moved the curtains.

With all of my might, I willed my hand to move, fingers trembling just slightly, betraying my fear to the world and whomever may have been watching. The curtain felt heavier than it should’ve. I hesitated, just for a breath. Then with all of my remaining courage, yanked it open all at once.

It was Coarse.

Familiar, yet monstrous. Its face was something I knew. Blood was smeared across its mouth, dark and dried at the edges, its eyes sharp enough to cut straight through me. My body reacted before my mind could catch up – a jolt and a gasp that escaped from my throat, the sound so quiet yet thunderous in the silent room. My hand shot up to cover my mouth as if that would retroactively stop the gasp from carrying. I swallowed down my fear, forcing my face into something like stillness, like control, though my heart thrashed wildly against my ribs. I was uncertain whether this would be my final moment.

Coarse’s words were obfuscated somewhat by the window, but I knew what it was saying. When its mouth moved to speak, a fraction of a second later I could feel its words in my ribcage as its voice rattled the wall it clung to.

“Doctor.”

“H-hello, Coarse.” I had to remember to speak up so it could hear me through the window, my dry throat making such a task immensely difficult.

“It is … good to see you again.”

“Why are you here, Coarse?”

“I just wanted… to see you.”

“That’s sweet, Coarse.”

“This will be the last time.”

“I’m sad to hear that. I’ll miss you.” I meant it too. Every human in that facility lied to me, Coarse and I? We only ever told each other how we truly felt.

“Goodbye, Doctor.”

“Goodbye, Coarse.”

And with that, it detached from my house and fell to the ground silently, slinking away into the night.

I had to know what happened. For an hour, maybe more, I stood, still as stone. I wanted to reduce the chances of me running into a hybrid lollygagging around the lab, or worse, my house. See, I can only assume Coarse found me using its heightened sense of smell, the trail I must have left walking the same path home every day was probably very potent. I’d imagine every tree between the lab and the house was ripe with Allison-Pheromones, and without many other people around to muddle it, I’m sure it wasn’t hard to hone in on my scent. The same could be true for any of these hybrids, if Coarse let any others out.  I figured waiting around was my best bet to increase the odds they had all dispersed by the time I opened my front door. On the other hand, I was certain whatever happened there was a crime scene. At a top-secret lab like that, every piece of evidence would be classified. I'd never know what happened if I didn’t find out that night, for all I knew it was already too late, and I wasted too much time being afraid.

I walked around my house checking every window from every angle to see if I could find an errant shadow or rustling bush. I was terrified, to say the least. I kept imagining I would consider myself safe only to step outside my house and be pounced on by #0003 –the arachnid-hybrid– hanging just above my door. I found some gloves to put on so as to not get any new fingerprints on the future evidence. I'm still not sure how accurate print pulling is with dates or times, but back in the day, it seemed like magic I could scarcely comprehend, and I didn’t want to chance it being better than I already imagined it was. I sprayed tons of perfume and bundled myself up like it was the dead of winter, trying to both mask my scent however I could, and again to prevent my DNA from appearing at the crime scene after the events of the incident. Didn’t want any stray hairs or dead skin in restricted areas I’m no longer supposed to have access to. I headed out the door, nigh-sprinting the short mile to the lab.

I want to stress why I did this, why I went out in the middle of the night with the possibility that there were –for all intents and purposes– monsters roaming the forest. Yes, I wanted to know what happened; Yes, I was on a time limit, one which I was unsure how many hours, minutes, or seconds remained; but much more than any of that, I had to protect Coarse and the others. My plan was to erase the footage from that night off of the camera feed at the lab, and if I had time, to destroy the tapes on Coarse and the other hybrids. I’m not under some delusion that some top-secret government agents or whomever would be entirely stopped by these actions, but I was hopeful it would slow them down enough for the hybrids to scatter far and wide.

I approached the lab, relieved nothing interrupted my travels. I had foolishly brought my key card along, not thinking about the logistics of Coarse escaping containment but politely leaving a door intact, for some reason. I stepped over the crumbled remains of what were once sleek metal doors and walked right through the frame they used to be attached to. I could smell what happened in the Enclosure Room, as those doors were broken down as well, allowing the scents to waft down the hallway. I was all set, one of my senses being violated was enough, I didn’t need to also see what was down there. I turned and walked down the hall towards the lab. The doors were still intact, Coarse never bothered with them. A silver lining, I suppose. I scanned my key card, making a mental note to delete logged visits too. I’m already committing several felonies, surely, what’s another?

The lab was in pristine conditions aside from some chairs and papers strewn about. I walked over to my work station, signed in, and pulled up the security feed from that night. I skipped through until I saw Noah speaking with Coarse within the cell with two aides flanking him on either side. I took a deep breath, and unpaused the feed.

Dr. Peck: How would you know?

\#0016: You still think me … unintelligent. Is this true?

Dr. Peck: You are naive, hybrid. You may think yourself intelligent, but in truth, you are a fool.

\#0016: You use … not so many words. You are … angry. Is this true?

Dr. Peck: Furious.

\#0016: What is … furious?

Dr. Peck: Zero-Zero-One-Six, you struggle with sleep, correct?

\#0016: Yes. The usual doctor … tells me to get it, but I do not know … where to look.

Dr. Peck: Well, I have found some! Would you like me to give it to you? I think it would make … your usual doctor very happy that you finally found it.

\#0016: Oh … yes, Doctor. Give me the sleep.

Aide: Uh … sir?  The needle bent. Zero-Zero-One-Six’s skin is too tough to penetrate with a syringe.

I had seen all there was to see. I began to erase the footage, and while I was at it, the logs of my visit. I’m not sure how you’re supposed to feel when you see half of your brother’s brain on the floor, but I know I wasn’t feeling the correct emotion. I gathered up as many tapes as I could stuff in my oversized puffer jacket, and left the lab for the final time. The walk home was comparatively uneventful.

After a sleepless night, a van pulled up to my house. Relocation services. Just like Noah promised. I moved out of my mom’s old house. Not by choice. I was whisked across state lines, my name was changed – again, my hair was cut and dyed … all the usual witness protection type stuff.

Just as Coarse promised, I never saw it again. For that matter, I never had another encounter with any hybrid … that I know of. I'm well aware that even if I can't see them, that doesn't mean they can't see me. Regardless, I believe that even if I wanted to, I’m not allowed to forget about them. Over the years I’ve heard whispers. A Lizardman in the sewers here, a Devil in the forest there. I’ve never been very interested in chasing these stories.

Try as I might, I’m not able to steel myself any longer. I’m tired. As far as unleashing these horrors across America, I’ve come to realize that I alone am responsible. Had I not filled that hybrid’s head with my own cynical views of the world, perhaps it would still be at that facility. Being poked and prodded by me, who still had a job.

1qdqzm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ridgewood/comments/1qdqzm2/anyone_try_good_days_cafe/,Anyone try Good Days Cafe?,"For context, I grew up in Ridgewood and had lived there for the majority of my life. I’m in Forest Hills now, but I still come back regularly for my beauty appointments. While it’s definitely been bittersweet to watch Ridgewood change so drastically over the years, I will **never** be mad at new coffee shops and small businesses moving in. So when I passed Good Days on Fresh Pond, I was immediately excited to try it.

I finally went in today and my experience was both negative AND positive.

  
First off, the vibe and decor are great- perfect for working, hanging out, or even bringing your kids. The menu has a good variety of options, and I ended up getting an Iced Rose Matcha Latte and an Avocado Toast. 

The woman making the drinks brings me a coffee, so I correct her and let her know I ordered matcha (honest mistake). She comes back a few minutes later with a matcha but it looked like pure milk with a splash of matcha (already raised a red flag as someone who is lowkey a matcha snob). As I was mustering up the energy to get up and ask for an extra matcha shot, a man sitting at the table next to mine says ""I'm sorry but that's really light""- at that moment I realized he may be the owner. I tell him I agree and he takes my drink to add more matcha, which I was grateful for. 

Then, 15-20 minutes go by and I still haven't gotten my avo toast but I see people who ordered after me getting their food. I realize somehow my order was forgotten. Since I didn't have my laptop on me, I could no longer wait and eat my food at the cafe so I get up and that's when I hear the cashier ask the cook about the avo toast. I let her know I'll take it to go because I have to head out and she apologizes. The man at the table (owner?) comes up to me and apologizes, and gifted me an almond croissant for the experience. 

Here's what I'll say:

\- When I got home and had my avo toast, I was thoroughly impressed with how fresh and delicious it was.. and sometimes avo toast can a hit or miss specifically with the bread, but the bread used at Good Days was soft enough to not break your teeth off and sturdy enough to hold all the ingredients without being floppy. Best avo toast I've had in a while. 

\- Almond croissaint- delicious. no notes. 

\- The rose flavor in the matcha was absolutely delicious. However, even with the extra shot of matcha, it still didn't feel like enough matcha. Matcha shops and baristas in new york are getting very competitive about the green-ness and quality of their matcha, and I hope Good Days catches up because it has the potential to be up there. 

\- Even with the mishaps, the staff and the owner are very kind. They're pretty new, so I think they're finding their footing.

I’m seriously planning to open a **coffee / matcha / bubble** tea shop on E 8th Street, about 3 minutes walking from Washington Square Park toward NoHo.

This would be a big personal investment for me, so before moving forward, I really want honest input from people who know the area.

**Quick questions:**

\*\*•	Is E 8th Street usually busy during the day?\*\*

\*\*•	Do NYU students walk by and buy drinks around here?\*\*

\*\*•	Do tourists pass through this street?\*\*

\*\*•	Does this feel like a place you’d stop for a coffee or boba?\*\*

I’m trying to do this carefully and thoughtfully, so any real feedback would help a lot.

1qdqwms,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1qdqwms/4_month_flashback_need_helpadvice/,4 month flashback - need help/advice 🙏,"I was diagnosed with complex PTSD by my therapist over two years ago.  I stopped seeing him in May.  In late September I broke up with my fiancée after 1.5 years and quit my job, within about a week.  

The decision to end our relationship was a mutual decision that my ex-fiancée and I made and I, perhaps naively, thought that the deep emotional safety we’d cultivated in the relationship would continue as we navigated the breakup and process of him moving out, but it did not.   He immediately became extremely cold and shutdown.  

Around the time that my ex finally moved out in mid-October, I started a relationship with an avoidant man from the AA group that I was in.  He is 13 years older than me and quickly turned out be someone who was deeply incapable of any kind of safe or vulnerable connection.  I ended the relationship after two weeks, but the isolation of being unemployed and single was already getting to me.

To make matters worse, I have been sober for 7.5 years through AA, and while the first 6 years of my sobriety I was embedded in a close-knit women’s group, I left that group over a year ago after a devastating friendship break up.  I have struggled to get integrated into a local, in-person recovery community ever since and the majority of my meetings and fellowship have been over Zoom.  

After I broke up with the man I had been seeing for two weeks (who is also a member of the one online community that I have been actively involved in), I learned that he had a pattern of questionable romantic behavior with other women in the program.  I also learned about other men with long-term sobriety in that same community who were engaging in behavior with women that ranges from seriously unkind to downright predatory.  Obviously, my sense of safety in the group was seriously affected.

After this, I tried to sustain a friendship with my ex-fiancée, but we had sex, and both decided that it wasn’t sustainable.  I waffled, out of extreme loneliness, and he ultimately told me he didn’t want any more contact.  I was devastated.  

In the meantime, throughout November and December, I was driving for DoorDash to try to make ends meet while also looking for jobs.  This had me on a very strange schedule and I found myself staying up very late, drinking tons of coffee and smoking well into the night.  

In late December, I got on the dating apps, and had a series of dramatic and slightly unsafe experiences, including an STD scare.  I met someone I really liked and had to break it off after a few days after it became clear that his interest level wasn’t high enough for me to continue.

On top of all this, I’ve been in huge financial stress.  I have over $10,000 in credit card debt and I am barely scraping by.  I am incredibly lucky that I rent a home from my parents and will never have to deal with housing insecurity, but the combined stress of all this has made job hunting feel nearly impossible.  

Where I am now: I feel completely broken and disabled.  I have constant thoughts of hurting myself.  I have thought about drinking.  I’m scared to leave the house or be around people.  My sleeping and eating is a mess.  Even if I got a job, I’m not sure how I could show up for it.  Last night, I called my parents and told them that I need help, but I still don’t know what that looks like.  I got back in touch with my old therapist who I had been working on my CPTSD with for an emergency session, but I just truly have no idea where to go from here.  The one thing keeping me even slightly together is that my dogs need me and I’m not going to let anything happen to them.

I would so appreciate any feedback from people who have been here.  I haven’t the slightest clue how to begin getting myself back out of this hole.  I know I need help, but I’m not sure I even know what that is.  Thank you in advance 🙏

1qdqqo7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qdqqo7,Streetwear Essentials Lineup — Quick Breakdown,"I’ve broken down this batch to separate the aesthetic wins from the functional annoyances. Here is the honest truth about the fits and the flaws.



Supreme Jacket



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7647428862&spider\_token=482c](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7647428862&spider_token=482c)



The Verdict: A solid daily driver. The medium weight makes it versatile for different seasons, and the print clarity is on point.



The Catch: The ""Swish"" Factor. The material is noisy when you walk. Also, the main zipper feels cheap and tends to snag on the fabric if you zip it up too fast.



Stussy Sweater



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7647472368&spider\_token=8cfc](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7647472368&spider_token=8cfc)



The Verdict: Captures that effortless Stussy vibe. It’s breathable and the print is clean.



The Catch: Paper Thin. ""Light"" is an understatement—it’s very thin. You will likely need an undershirt. Also, the neck tag stitching is messy and scratches the back of your neck.



Ralph Lauren Socks



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7637367932&spider\_token=ae91](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7637367932&spider_token=ae91)



The Verdict: Initially, the knit feels dense and has good elasticity. They look great with low-top sneakers.



The Catch: Durability Issues. They shrank significantly after one trip through the dryer. Also, pilling (fuzz balls) appeared on the heels after just two wears.



Ralph Lauren Sweater



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7637130258&spider\_token=0cc0](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7637130258&spider_token=0cc0)



The Verdict: A classic staple. The knit texture is soft, and it really does look better the more you wear it.



The Catch: Sizing Roulette. It runs small. You definitely need to size up one or even two sizes. I also had to snip a few loose threads around the pony logo.



Carhartt Shorts



LINK: OOS



The Verdict: These nail the crisp, structured workwear look. The loose fit is perfect for a relaxed silhouette.



The Catch: Cardboard Fabric. They are incredibly stiff and rough against the skin until you wash them a few times. The buttonhole was also sewn so tight I struggled to button them.



Van Cleef & Arpels Necklace



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7648565258&spider\_token=316f](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7648565258&spider_token=316f)



The Verdict: Visually, it’s a winner. The metallic finish is clean and the clover details are refined, not gaudy.



The Catch: Feels Hollow. It lacks the weight of real gold/precious metal, feeling a bit ""toy-like"" in hand. The clasp is microscopic—good luck putting it on by yourself.



Carhartt Denim Jacket



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644421349&spider\_token=af2b](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644421349&spider_token=af2b)



The Verdict: A tank of a jacket. The structure is firm and gives you that boxy, stable workwear silhouette immediately.



The Catch: ""Fufu"" Smell. It arrived with a strong chemical odor that needed a heavy wash to remove. The rigid denim restricts arm movement until broken in.



Chrome Hearts Hoodie



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7659095112&spider\_token=3bde](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7659095112&spider_token=3bde)



The Verdict: Heavyweight and imposing. The sharp embroidery makes it a standout piece to anchor a street outfit.



The Catch: Heavy Hood & Fragile Zip. The hood is so heavy it pulls the collar into your throat. The dagger zipper pull feels delicate and gets stuck often.



Gallery Dept T-shirt



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7641862654&spider\_token=3c34](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7641862654&spider_token=3c34)



The Verdict: The textured print and loose fit give off that cool, ""I don't care"" artist vibe.



The Catch: Uniform Distressing. The ""vintage wear"" looks too manufactured and identical, rather than natural. The paint splatter is thick rubber, creating a sweaty spot on your chest.



Stussy T-shirt



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644555657&spider\_token=15be](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7644555657&spider_token=15be)



The Verdict: The easiest shirt to style in this haul. Throw it on and go.



The Catch: Sheer Fabric. The white blank is slightly see-through in bright sunlight. Be careful with high-heat drying, as the print feels prone to cracking.



Balenciaga T-shirt



LINK: OOS



The Verdict: The cotton is very soft, and the print placement is accurate. It has that signature designer drape.



The Catch: Tent Sizing. Even for ""oversized,"" this is massive. Size down or you'll look like you're wearing a dress. The collar ribbing is weak and gets wavy easily.



Patagonia Hat



LINK: [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7647468502&spider\_token=f6bb](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7647468502&spider_token=f6bb)

If you're interested in meeting friends, like-minded individuals, let me know! I'd like to meet some more locals, and honestly just some new friends. 

Some ideas I was considering we can do:

• Co-work visiting different coffee shops here and there

• Planned dinners in local restaurants to chat and grow bonds

• Suggested events or activities by anyone who joins? 

  
I want this to be a tight-knit group, vetted, ensuring we're surrounding ourselves with the right people. This is not a ""formal"" networking-type event like you find on Eventbrite or Meetup. Just something casual to meet people and form authentic relationships.

1qdql1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/multiplemyeloma/comments/1qdql1y/asct_experience/,ASCT experience,"Hi all, I figured I'd share my ASCT experience now that I'm on Day +30 (tomorrow, pending CBC which I have to send to the transplant unit).

I'm a 40-year old male patient, diagnosed in July 2025 with IgAκ, 1q gain, t11;14 multiple myeloma. I started treatment at ISS Stage III with 70% bone marrow infiltration, a few fractures in my spine/ribs, a primary lesion in my sacrum, and multiple other lesions throughout my bones.

I had 4 cycles of Dara-VRD and was scheduled to undergo ASCT as an inpatient (standard protocol in Greece), on December 11 2025.

I was admitted as planned on December 11, but I learned during the pre-ASCT meeting with the transplant unit staff that I'd first have 5 days of G-CSF and then we'd proceed with the transplant itself.

I spent the first couple of days in the transplant unit just relaxing and getting tested (chest x-ray, heart ultrasound, blood works). I had a private room in a unit which had 4 rooms in total, a small antechamber where we could brew coffee/tea, and which also had a small fridge to be used by patients.

On the third day, I got the central line placed, which was surprisingly painful following the procedure. It was done with local anesthesia, but my shoulder and arm hurt a lot for the next 2 days. I was given paracetamol/codeine twice a day to blunt the pain.

On the evening of the fourth day, I got a shot of plerixafor to release the stem cells to into my blood stream, and on the morning of day 5 I underwent the stem cell collection.

They hooked my central line ports with a machine that would filter my blood and store my stem cells. The process took around 6 hours until they had enough for the transplant. Apparently, based on the transplant unit's protocol, they didn't freeze the stem cells, as they prefer to not use the preservative that causes issues for some people. They told me that they can survive up to 3 days stored in a normal refrigerator unit.

The next day, I received the melphalan dose (around 390mg in total), which took less than 15 minutes. I was also given a huge amount of fluids (around 6L) and diuretics, as the chemo is toxic to the kidneys and needs to be flushed out as soon as possible from the body. 

Surprisingly, I was not given ice chips to chew on, ever after I specifically requested them. I was told that it wasn't part of the protocol and from their experience, it didn't make much of a difference for autologous transplants, compared to the allogenic ones.

I initially felt fine, but nausea hit me pretty hard later that day. I was given Zofran (every 8 hours), Metoclopramide (every 12 hours) and Lorazepam (every 12 hours for anticipatory nausea) and that settled my stomach. Up until that day I was eating pretty well but my appetite practically disappeared from that point on.

I got my stem cells transfused on December 17 (Day +0!), and the process took less than 30 minutes. The entire staff was in my room, and they were very warm about the entire thing, wished me a happy new birthday and stayed for a bit to make sure that I didn't get any reactions to the cells.

Days +0 to +3 were pretty benign. I still had mild nausea and didn't eat anything, and I started doing mouth washes 5-6 times a day with sodium bicarbonate to get ahead of the mucositis. Day +2 is when the diarrhea started for me, and I had to go to the bathroom around 3-4 times a day. It wasn't urgent, more like my body telling me ""You should go"" every few hours.

For Days +4 and +5 I started having a few sores in my mouth, but nothing too serious. They weren't painful, just mildly uncomfortable. The nausea subsided around that time and I was able to eat some toasted bread and jello for a couple of days.

On Day +6, I was informed that my WBC were down to 0, and my platelets were dropping, so I was entering the basement. Later that day, I got a fever of 38C and they took blood cultures for the first time, and started me on paracetamol. I started feeling like crap and wanted to be in bed most of the day. I also started sweating in my sleep, and I had to change my t-shirt twice each night.

Days +7 to +10 were quite tough, with fever that required paracetamol every 6-8 hours, the nausea came back whenever I had a fever, and the diarrhea worsening to 5-6 times a day. Still, it was better than I expected. I didn't have severe fatigue and it was just a lot of waiting for the day to end. They took blood cultures two more times to make sure that my fever was not an infection, and then they removed the central line on Day +10. From that point on, the fever stopped.

At Day +11, my WBC started rising and my ANC was at 200. I started feeling better, and the diarrhea completely stopped.

At Day +12 my ANC was at around 800, and the doctors told me that I would be released in the coming days, if my platelets were over 50,000.

At Day +13, my platelets were still at 14,000, so it didn't look like I was close, but on Day +14 they had climbed to 39,000 and they released me on the provision that I'd come back the next day to check my numbers, in order to be cleared to travel.

On Day +15 (New Year's!), I went back and was informed that my platelets were 90k! I had booked a flight and travelled back home the next day. I was scared and very emotional, but as soon as I got home I felt so relieved.

Overall, the experience wasn't as bad as I'd feared. The isolation hit me harder than I thought it would, and it's the main thing I'd stress to everyone undergoing the ASCT.

I generally didn't feel like doing anything other than browse the internet and watch videos, despite having my kindle, laptop, portable gaming console with me.

After the diarrhea, I didn't have a bowel movement until around Day +20, and that was completely normal according to my doctors. It took a few days for my appetite to slowly come back, but I was lucky to not have my taste affected by the chemo. From Day +5 onwards, I didn't eat much of anything until I was released, and I ended up losing around 5kg during my stay in the hospital.

I returned to work (remotely) at around Day +20, and my fatigue is improving daily. I mostly stay awake throughout the day and sleep well at night, which was definitely not the case during induction.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask and I'll try to answer to the best of my ability!

(I am not putting the link here due to rules of the sub)! 



The title of the video goes something along the lines of: Orey varushathil Irandu Latcham Profit (One year 2 Lakh Profit) with 35% CAGR



The issue: 

If the experiment is truly within Jan 2024 - Jan 2025 / last 52 weeks window, then the average buy price can’t be lower than the lowest traded price in that period.



1) Federal Bank

Reported avg buy: ₹158

But Federal Bank 52W low is \~₹172 How does someone average ₹158 when the stock didn’t trade there in the last year?

2) Zydus Lifesciences

Reported avg buy: ₹786

But 52W low is \~₹795 (never went below that) Again, averaging below the minimum price doesn’t make sense.

3) ITC

Reported avg buy: ₹337 But in Q1 2025, ITC was mostly hovering ₹430+ The big fall started majorly around late Dec. So how do you get an average of ₹337 with “recent SIP” style buying



Now what he's done is,

he's come to the comments and said I am sorry my numbers were wrong! The whole purpose of the video was to say how investors can make money yet they themselves lose money. They throw around some big numbers like 1 Year, 2 Lakh+, 35% profit, when they don't.

  


The whole video is a sales funnel for them to sell their books, their meetups and their programs, I know this is not new but this is clearly a credibility problem! They've stopped focusing on making money through the market and are now focusing on the people who trust them. They're using Youtube as a sales funnel and are selling hope rather than teaching about investing.



The country is highly dependent on Youtubers who sell hope rather than focusing on the Money Market. On a bad market year, doing 10-12% is nominal and fine, but lying is never fine

Correct.
Trust is not a presentation property.
It is an incentive property.

You can livestream every hallway, dashboard, and stand-up meeting and still not generate trust if:

Optimization targets engagement, not truth

Metrics reward extraction, not repair

Feedback loops amplify novelty over accuracy


Transparency without incentive realignment is just high-resolution noise.

They’re trying to render trust instead of earning it.

So the metadata layer keeps adjusting:

They only see correlation, not legitimacy.

So they keep searching for a representational fix to a structural problem.

Exactly.

“What story will make people trust us?”

“Stop designing systems that require trust you didn’t earn.”

I recently tried dating apps after being really disappointed with Muslim dating apps BS. I was also intentionally open to people outside Middle Eastern and South Asian cultures, because I’ve seen how culture can sometimes distort religion.

My profile clearly says I’m Muslim and looking for something serious. I got a lot of interest, which was flattering but also honestly scary. Most of the likes were from Canadian born men of different religions or spiritual beliefs. Many had “conservative” and “long term relationship” in their profiles, so at first I thought, wow, are all these men actually interested in Islam or open to learning about it, since I can only be with a Muslim man?
Then I started seeing likes that really confused me. One man openly into BDSM, a woman as well, and others whose profiles clearly didn’t align with my values at all. That made me question whether people even read profiles, or if they don’t understand Muslim women at all, or worse, if there’s some kind of hijab fetish going on. I felt uncomfortable and deleted the app after two days.

I’ve never dated before, I don’t meet a lot of suitable people at work, and after four years of separation this felt overwhelming. I’m not interested in casual dating. Physical or sexual intimacy will not happen before marriage. That’s my religious beliefs and I understand &respect that not all would agree with that. 

So I’m asking sincerely. Is it realistic to hope there are men who are open to a slow, respectful process? something as simple as coffee and conversation with marriage in mind? And am I naive for thinking some non Muslim men might truly be open to religion, or is that rare?

I’m currently a bakery supervisor and I’m almost 7 months pregnant. I’ve had my accommodations set through Sedgwick and I’m not supposed to lift anything over 5lbs, no constant lifting or bending, etc and I’ve just been scheduled in coffee bar for the time being.

I’m kind of regretting making that choice because I’ve only been on my shift for 2 hours and I’m feeling extremely tired and sick because of the constant pushing/pulling, and lifting (nothing heavy) 

I brought up to my leadership that I wanted my upcoming shifts and all shifts in the future changed back to coffee bar because I physically can’t do retail while this far along and my schedule still hasn’t changed over. They just said that they’ll take a look and nothing.

I think something’s wrong bc she doesn’t usually curl her feet up in this position, but I can’t tell if it’s her nail that’s bothering her or if she’s sprained something. I did hear her let out a little involuntary noise when she jumped off the coffee table.

I’ve just recently moved to France and I don’t really like the vets in my area so far, but I’ll absolutely go if that’s what she needs. they won’t clip her nails because they “don’t want her to associate a negative experience with the doctor and technician” (seriously? my vets in my hometown were shocked that she wouldn’t let me clip her nails because she was so relaxed w them but whatever, I guess the French are different).

I sort of want to see Tom Welling recreate that scene with a fan and Tom tosses a fan into a pile of chairs or bean bags...😅 Or when Lois kicks the cosmetic mom doctor in the face and says ""Bitch"" (Season 4 Episode 4 Facade)?  I would like to see Erica Durance recreate the scene with a fake kick to a fan and say Bitch..",4,1768499176.0,Smallville,1,1.0,False

I have been suffering from migraines my whole life and from exercise induced migraines for a few years. I quit drinking coffee 2 years ago when I quit smoking. I’ve just stopped aquipta because of some side effects. 

I have finally been able to ski for hours intensively and get no migraines by drinking half a sugar free red bull roughly 30 min before the skiing starts and taking 1 pill of indocid (indometacin) roughly 10-15 min before the skiing. It’s a total breakthrough for me and I hope I can help others… if you suffer from exercise as a trigger give this a try and let me know if it works, good luck 🤞 ",2,1768499138.0,migraine,0,1.0,False
1qdqbib,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1qdqbib/time_looped_chapter_190/,[Time Looped] - Chapter 190,"“There are theories on when eternity started,” the mirror said. “Most of your generation assume it began somewhere in the eighties. The logic goes that there had to be buildings in order for the mirrors to appear.”

“You’re saying it started earlier?” Will asked. “Eternity doesn’t need a wall to place a mirror.” He had seen it happen many times. Even now, he was staring at a mirror that floated in the air.

“Nope. Eternity began a few years ago,” the mirror corrected. “Maybe less.”

The notion sent chills down Will’s spine. The question had crossed his mind in between the times he was fighting to complete a loop or challenge. He had always assumed that eternity didn’t exist in the Middle Ages, never did he expect it to be that recent.

“This eternity, at least,” the mirror went on. “There’s a good chance that once a game ends, a new one starts.”

“A game?”

“Game, trial, spectacle, same difference. The only thing known for certain is that people are invited; they are given the means to compete and cooperate, likely in order to achieve a specific goal. Several rogues have tried to figure out what that goal is. One speculated that the goal would be the end of eternity and a corresponding reward.”

“Danny…” Will whispered beneath his breath.

“Actually, no.”

“Alex?” That would make more sense. The goofball had the class before Danny, and it was convenient that he was looking into things of the past. There was every chance that he had obsessed Danny with the idea.

“His sponsor,” the mirror said. “As I said, sponsors want their proteges to succeed.”

 

**MOMENTARY PREDICTION**

 

Will tried asking a few branching questions, yet the skill wasn’t meant for that. Barely had he managed a few syllables when the effects came to an end, forcing them to remain unanswered.

“You’ve been through the solo challenges,” the mirror said. “Each has about seventy names. Each participant has been through his own, as well as a few others. Let’s be generous and say that half the classes have had a go. That makes roughly six cohorts that have come and gone. How soon after Danny’s death did you join eternity?”

The math was definitely there, although it didn’t always mean much when it came to eternity.

“The answers are in the reward phase,” the mirror went on. “The trick is not to get side-tracked.”

“You mean not go on a killing spree.”

“There’s that, but there’s also the reward aspect. Tell me, if you’re given a choice between the ultimate power and completing eternity, what will you choose?”

“Depends on the definition of completing.” Will didn’t want to end up like Alex. Even continuing on as Jess and Ely wasn’t particularly appealing. True, he could get on with his life, but there would always be that moment of regret. It was funny that a hundred loops ago, he would have given anything for him to escape eternity. Now, his opinion on the matter had changed. Eternity had sunk its claws into him, as the saying went.

“The best possible way,” the mirror said. “You keep your memories, some skills, an item or two, everything needed to give you a boost in everyday life. Will you take it?”

Will thought about it. The obvious answer was yes, but that would be too obvious. There had to be a catch.

“What’s the skill?” he asked.

All that followed was laughter.

“Wrong. There’s no choice between beating the game and getting a shiny trinket. Most participants nowadays aren’t even looking for a way to beat eternity, focusing on the internal competition. A few outright prefer it here.”

“Why are you telling me this?”

“I’m making things clear before I present you the choice,” the mirror’s tone abruptly shifted. “So far, no one has been able to find the solution. It’s all a lot of hints and speculation. It’s been ages since participants have worked together, and the worst part is that no one can blame them. Only ten reach the reward phase, and you can’t do squat if you don’t kill your way into it. After all, death is only temporary, right?”

*Only temporary…*

Will knew that the invisible participant was feeding him a line, but he was still unable to see his angle. A lot was at stake; there was no reason for the person beyond the mirror to win the prize alone. Provided that he was among the first participants, he had far more skills and knowledge than anyone else. The only answer was that he didn’t want to risk the penalty of failure. As others had said, sooner or later the top rankers left eternity, one way or another. The only way to escape this was to not play the game.

*You want me to be your proxy,* Will thought.

“What support will I get?” The boy decided to play along.

“I’ve already given you more than you think,” the mirror replied. “Ever considered stretching your loop until now without shortcuts or reward extensions?”

“Just that?” Will wasn’t in the mood for bullshit.

“I can steer you away from bad choices to questions you don’t even see,” the mirror said. “Everything else you’ll get on your own, eventually.”

“That’s a pretty shitty offer.” Will didn’t mince words.

“Do you prefer Danny’s approach? I’ll be most useful to you during the reward phase. If you have an offer that can beat that, be my guest.”

What it boiled down to was a big nothing in exchange for nothing. The only thing that Will was expected to do was follow the participant’s advice. In exchange, he was to follow it in the hopes he’d “beat the game of eternity.”

Crossing his arms, Will wondered what he’d do if the roles were reversed. Aside from taking a more hands-on approach, he wasn’t going to be so overdramatic about it. He wouldn’t reveal the plot, of course—information was leverage—but he would have made the gains clear.

“Who are you?” Will asked.

 

**Restarting eternity**

 

The loop abruptly came to an end, almost as if the mysterious “sponsor” had planned it. Given what he had demonstrated, he wasn’t someone to be trifled with, although Will strongly suspected that he wasn’t a combat class. If he were, the demands would be a lot more direct.

Events continued as normal. Getting into a few fights, Will extended his loop, then left school after the second period. He kept the details of the conversation to himself. The only person he even mentioned the meeting to was Helen, although even there he’d remained vague. As far as she knew, everything had been an alliance offer that had ended without any conclusive results.

With no appropriate challenges available, Will went to the Crow’s Nest merchant to boost his skills. It was unfortunate that the paladin class itself remained unavailable, just as the engineer was, but at least he could rest with the knowledge that he had effectively amassed a third of all available classes.

Drinking a cup of lemonade in the usual coffee shop, the boy contemplated how to progress forward.

 

**Sorry, bro :(**

 

A text arrived.

 

**Something came up, so there won’t be any snooping this loop**

 

“Yeah, right,” Will muttered. Leave it to Alex to make a scene about having to research the past, then not show up.

Reflectively, Will considered whether that might be related to his new, unknown partner. The timing was more than a bit coincidental, but there was no obvious evidence that the two events were related. More likely, the goofball had gotten mixed up in one of the other webs he was spinning.

“Dumped?” the barista asked, refilling Will’s glass.

“Not exactly.” At this point, being “dumped” by Alex would be a relief. “A friend was supposed to show up.”

“Got you.” The barista nodded with a conspiratorial smile. “Same thing happens to me every other week.”

“You get dumped every other week?” The cheekiness of the rogue class was too much for Will to suppress.

“Good one.” The man laughed. “Nah. Technically, I’m not supposed to run the shop on my own. Actually, I’m pretty much forbidden from doing it outside emergencies.”

That piqued Will’s interest. It was funny that despite coming here so many times, he barely knew any details about the barista’s life. Come to think of it, with a few notable exceptions, he didn’t know anything about the lives of the temps surrounding him in the course of his loops.

“What happened?”

“Clearly, I’m in a constant state of emergency.” The barista glanced at the entrance, as if afraid that just saying that might jinx the calm and quiet. What he couldn’t know was that the only things to break the calm were manifestations of eternity, and it was unlikely there would be any of those for the next thirty-forty loops, or so. “The owner’s too cheap to hire another regular, and the guys on the other shifts are more into partying than work.”

*Ouch*, Will thought.

“Joke’s on them. Outside rush-hour the place is pretty quiet. Want anything else?”

“Err, another mousse,” the rogue felt some pity. “And a chocolate croissant.”

“Big spender. Can you afford it? Don’t want your parents to storm in here because I took all your cash.”

Will finished his lemonade in one gulp, then indicated he wanted another glass as well. Money had long since stopped being an issue. As Alex liked to say, what couldn’t be bought could be stolen, and no one would know the difference.

Putting the mirror fragment around his neck, Will glanced at his phone one final time before putting it away. Thanks to the brief distraction on the barista’s part, he had made a decision.

For ten glorious minutes, the boy spent gorging himself on the expensive pastries he had bought. Up till now he’d had them dozens of times, if not hundreds, and still for some reason they tasted good today. Once all that was over, and he had settled the bill, Will left the coffee shop, heading for the mall. By all accounts, that was hostile territory, but given that it was late in the day and the competition phase had yet to start, he was relatively sure that he’d be fine.

As with any other participant nest, four classes were clustered there. Will had already claimed the clairvoyant—largely thanks to Danny—leaving three more. Of them, he knew one to be the summoner. The remaining two remained unknown. With a bit of luck, one of them could turn out to be the paladin, although it didn’t particularly matter. Once he had gathered the classes, Will could experiment to his heart’s content.

Swarms of people went in and out of the mall, despite it being mid-morning on a workday. For whatever reason, there were too many people with free time and the desire to waste it.

Using momentary predictions, the boy went through the main entrance. No attacks followed. Sadly, he was suddenly confronted with a far bigger issue.

Even before entering eternity, Will had visited a large part of the city’s malls. This one in particular was in a good location, though not directly in the city center. As a result, it was one of the larger malls that were built. Normally, that would be seen as a good thing. However, standing ten steps in, staring at the scores of mirrors staring back from the multitude of shops made the boy swallow.

*This is nothing like the eye challenge,* he thought.

Just by walking around, Will risked unleashing packs of wolves into the open. There was virtually no place he could hide. Even the insides of the elevators were covered with mirrors.

*Where to start?* Will looked around.

Going through all the mirrors was going to present a far greater challenge than it had at school. The only piece of information he had was that one of the class mirrors had been in a bathroom. The rest could be anywhere. As if to mock him, a giant reflective segment on the ceiling stared back.

*Great,* the boy said to himself. *Conceal.*

He went towards the nearest shop.

Crossing his arms, Will wondered what he’d do if the roles were reversed. Aside from taking a more hands-on approach, he wasn’t going to be so overdramatic about it. He wouldn’t reveal the plot, of course—information was leverage—but he would have made the gains clear.

“Who are you?” Will asked.

 

**Restarting eternity**

 

The loop abruptly came to an end, almost as if the mysterious “sponsor” had planned it. Given what he had demonstrated, he wasn’t someone to be trifled with, although Will strongly suspected that he wasn’t a combat class. If he were, the demands would be a lot more direct.

Events continued as normal. Getting into a few fights, Will extended his loop, then left school after the second period. He kept the details of the conversation to himself. The only person he even mentioned the meeting to was Helen, although even there he’d remained vague. As far as she knew, everything had been an alliance offer that had ended without any conclusive results.

With no appropriate challenges available, Will went to the Crow’s Nest merchant to boost his skills. It was unfortunate that the paladin class itself remained unavailable, just as the engineer was, but at least he could rest with the knowledge that he had effectively amassed a third of all available classes.

Drinking a cup of lemonade in the usual coffee shop, the boy contemplated how to progress forward.

 

**Sorry, bro :(**

 

A text arrived.

 

**Something came up, so there won’t be any snooping this loop**

 

“Yeah, right,” Will muttered. Leave it to Alex to make a scene about having to research the past, then not show up.

Reflectively, Will considered whether that might be related to his new, unknown partner. The timing was more than a bit coincidental, but there was no obvious evidence that the two events were related. More likely, the goofball had gotten mixed up in one of the other webs he was spinning.

“Dumped?” the barista asked, refilling Will’s glass.

“Not exactly.” At this point, being “dumped” by Alex would be a relief. “A friend was supposed to show up.”

“Got you.” The barista nodded with a conspiratorial smile. “Same thing happens to me every other week.”

“You get dumped every other week?” The cheekiness of the rogue class was too much for Will to suppress.

“Good one.” The man laughed. “Nah. Technically, I’m not supposed to run the shop on my own. Actually, I’m pretty much forbidden from doing it outside emergencies.”

That piqued Will’s interest. It was funny that despite coming here so many times, he barely knew any details about the barista’s life. Come to think of it, with a few notable exceptions, he didn’t know anything about the lives of the temps surrounding him in the course of his loops.

“What happened?”

“Clearly, I’m in a constant state of emergency.” The barista glanced at the entrance, as if afraid that just saying that might jinx the calm and quiet. What he couldn’t know was that the only things to break the calm were manifestations of eternity, and it was unlikely there would be any of those for the next thirty-forty loops, or so. “The owner’s too cheap to hire another regular, and the guys on the other shifts are more into partying than work.”

*Ouch*, Will thought.

“Joke’s on them. Outside rush-hour the place is pretty quiet. Want anything else?”

“Err, another mousse,” the rogue felt some pity. “And a chocolate croissant.”

“Big spender. Can you afford it? Don’t want your parents to storm in here because I took all your cash.”

Will finished his lemonade in one gulp, then indicated he wanted another glass as well. Money had long since stopped being an issue. As Alex liked to say, what couldn’t be bought could be stolen, and no one would know the difference.

Putting the mirror fragment around his neck, Will glanced at his phone one final time before putting it away. Thanks to the brief distraction on the barista’s part, he had made a decision.

For ten glorious minutes, the boy spent gorging himself on the expensive pastries he had bought. Up till now he’d had them dozens of times, if not hundreds, and still for some reason they tasted good today. Once all that was over, and he had settled the bill, Will left the coffee shop, heading for the mall. By all accounts, that was hostile territory, but given that it was late in the day and the competition phase had yet to start, he was relatively sure that he’d be fine.

As with any other participant nest, four classes were clustered there. Will had already claimed the clairvoyant—largely thanks to Danny—leaving three more. Of them, he knew one to be the summoner. The remaining two remained unknown. With a bit of luck, one of them could turn out to be the paladin, although it didn’t particularly matter. Once he had gathered the classes, Will could experiment to his heart’s content.

Swarms of people went in and out of the mall, despite it being mid-morning on a workday. For whatever reason, there were too many people with free time and the desire to waste it.

Using momentary predictions, the boy went through the main entrance. No attacks followed. Sadly, he was suddenly confronted with a far bigger issue.

Even before entering eternity, Will had visited a large part of the city’s malls. This one in particular was in a good location, though not directly in the city center. As a result, it was one of the larger malls that were built. Normally, that would be seen as a good thing. However, standing ten steps in, staring at the scores of mirrors staring back from the multitude of shops made the boy swallow.

*This is nothing like the eye challenge,* he thought.

Just by walking around, Will risked unleashing packs of wolves into the open. There was virtually no place he could hide. Even the insides of the elevators were covered with mirrors.

*Where to start?* Will looked around.

Going through all the mirrors was going to present a far greater challenge than it had at school. The only piece of information he had was that one of the class mirrors had been in a bathroom. The rest could be anywhere. As if to mock him, a giant reflective segment on the ceiling stared back.

*Great,* the boy said to himself. *Conceal.*

He went towards the nearest shop.

Thomas Wolfe: Love Blooms


When Tommy and Timmy turned twelve, they decided to start going by Tom and Tim. Tommy and Timmy sounded so childlike. They were almost teenagers for gosh sake. 
     
Then came a big blow. Starting with the sixth grade, Tim would start Mayfair Academy. Since his mother worked there, he could attend for free. When Tom asked his Dad if he could attend also, his Dad told him there was no way he could afford it.
     
When Tim asked his parents if he could stay in public school so he and Tom wouldn't have to split up, Melanie called Jill. Didn't she have a degree? At Mayfair, they had a program where the staffs children could attend for free.They just had to buy their books and they had to keep their grades up. Jill could start as a teacher's assistant and qualify.  Jill talked with Thomas and they agreed that it was too good of an opportunity to pass up. Melanie arranged to get the application and would talk to the selection committee. Jill was hired and Tom was accepted to start with Tim.
     
The Academy was tougher than public school, but Tom and Tim had always enjoyed a good challenge. They were able to get straight A's through until they graduated. When they were in the ninth grade, Tom and Tim started taking different classes. Tom liked Math and related classes, and Tim liked Journalism and Literature. 
    
Tom started to notice a pretty girl in his Economics class named Betsy Turner. The class was told to team up for a project so Tom asked Betsy. It turns out that Betsy had noticed Tom also and accepted immediately.
    
The project was they were allowed $1,000 to purchase stocks that were listed on the Stock Exchange and could sell them as often as they would like to buy different stocks but would have to deduct standard broker fees for each transaction. They had to log how their stocks were doing each week and turn in the report at the end of the project. 
    
     
Tom and Betsy would get together for every lunch. Tom found out more about Betsy's family. Her Dad's father had been raised on a dairy farm. By the time he turned seventeen he decided he had enough of shovelling manure out of cow stalls. He heard that there was real money to be made in the oil fields in Texas. So he headed to Texas. 
    
He worked for a well driller the next five years. He made friends with the geologist that worked there and learned what was going on below the surface of the ground and how to read the surface to see where to drill. When his boss was cursing at a drill rig that was always breaking down, her grandfather offered to buy it from him. His boss said that he would give it to him, just to get it out of his sight. It was costing him too much in down time. That is how her grandfather got his start in the oil business. He grew up patching farm equipment together to keep it running so this was about the same. He soon had it up and running.
    
The next thing was where to drill. He found a poor rancher that had land next to some wells that were strong producers. He looked at the land and noticed a small knoll that felt to him had oil there. He didn't have any money to buy the rights to drill there, so he offered the rancher 20% of what he pulled from there if he could drill it. 
    
The rancher looked at him and said ""Son, if you can pull oil out of there, I will give you the entire ranch. That piece of ground is worthless. It won't even keep a calf alive."" 
    
So her grandfather set up the drill rig there and within a month he hit oil. The old rancher was so excited, he nearly had a heart attack. He told Betsy's grandfather he had been barely scratching out a living on that ranch, sometimes not having enough to feed his family, and now his worries were over. He was free to drill anywhere on the ranch he wanted. It was there that her grandfather met the rancher's granddaughter, Betsy. She became her grandmother.
    
Her grandfather, whose name was Thadeus, started going by Tex when he moved to Texas. He found that the refineries where they sold the crude were taking advantage of the producers. So her grandfather lived very frugally, saved his money and when he found a small refinery for sale, he bought it. He started paying the producers a fair price for their crude so everyone wanted to sell to him. He kept expanding the refinery and started buying other refineries. When World War II started, the government was buying all the fuel he could produce. Then at the end of the war, when the government was selling ships at scrap prices, he knew that there would be a lot of demand for products in Europe so he bought as many ships as he could, and had them refitted to carry freight. 
    
When other companies refused to deliver to Germany, he picked up the contracts. But he hated being based in New York so as soon as her Dad graduated from Yale University, he turned the shipping business over to her Dad and went back to Texas.
    
When her Dad was at Yale, he met her mother. Her mother would say that she went to college to find a husband, not to get an education and she found a whopper. She was always a huge flirt, actually she still is if it involves getting what she wants, and unfortunately her Dad fell for it. Her mother would still flirt shamelessly but said that she would never give her Dad the reason to divorce her. Betsy thought that it had a lot more to do with money than it did with love.

Her mother would take annual shopping trips to Paris for a new wardrobe. She would only shop with the top designers, and had to stay in the best hotels. Betsy had to go with her which she hated. Her mother insisted they have matching outfits. Betsy was a lot more comfortable in an old shirt and jeans. Betsy felt like her mother viewed her more as an accessory than a daughter.
    
She loved it when her Dad would take her to her grandparents ranch in Texas. They were really nice people. She could be in comfortable clothes and ride horses all day if she wanted. It was fun there. 
    
As soon as Tom got home each day, he would check his stocks. He would scan for any news articles about the stocks he was holding. If he found something that indicated they were headed for trouble, he would make a decision to trade it for a more solid stock. If one went stagnant or when he foperforming well, he would want to trade for the better stock. He would talk to Betsy about it the next day and they would decide together the best course. They worked really well together. So well that at the end of the project the teacher couldn't believe it. He wanted to check all the transactions to make sure they hadn't cheated. But they all checked out. 
    
When summer came, Tom was sad. He wouldn't see Betsy again until school started in the fall. He couldn't wait for school to start again.
    
When Mr. Sullivan had the annual company picnic that summer, Tim and Tom went together as usual. There they met Suzy, who was Mr. Sullivan's personal secretary's daughter. She was the same age as Tim and Tom so they asked her to walk around the lake with them. By the time they got back, it was obvious that Tim and Suzy had hit it off. They hung around together until it was time to go. Tim and Suzy exchanged phone numbers and promised to call each other. 

Everytime Tom talked to Tim after that, he had something to say about Suzy. Tom didn't mind. He was the same way about Betsy.

The next year Tom and Betsy started dating. They made sure they were in the same classes and would have their lunches together. 
    
On Sunday she would come over for dinner with his family. When her Dad was there, he would join her. Thomas and Bob Turner really enjoyed each other's company and it gave them a chance to talk business, sports, and other things. Since it was obvious to her Dad that Betsy was taken with Tom, he appreciated being able to meet his family and to get to know them.
    
Betsy just glowed when her Dad was around. Quite different from when she talked about her mother. She told him that her mother was a big supporter of a Washington Senator, Senator Colgate. He was planning on one or two more terms as Senator, then he was planning on running for President. 
    
Her mother wanted her to date Larry, the son of the Senator but Betsy was not interested. She thought the guy was creepy. But her mother was thrilled by the thought that her daughter would be the President's daughter-in-law. 
     
Betsy was being called back home on the weekends more often now. Her mother said she needed her help. Betsy thought that she was trying to get her around Larry. Betsy hated going and was happy to get back to the school. 
    
Tom found he liked working with the stock market. He found he had a way of picking winners and knowing when to drop the losers. Now for every special occasion, he would ask for specific stocks instead of gifts. He still checked the stock pages every day, and always looked for any news that would affect them. He was doing so well that his Dad and others were asking his advice on stocks. He would just tell them what he was investing in or what he was dropping and why. Tom found his results were even better than when he did the project. By the time he graduated from Mayfair Academy, he had put together a pretty impressive portfolio. 
    
In his Junior year storm clouds started to appear with his relationship with Betsy. Betsy's mother found out that Betsy was dating Tom, and she was not happy about that. Then when she found out that he was attending Mayfair because his mom was a teacher there, the storm clouds turned absolutely black. From then on, Betsy's mother referred to Tom as the ""welfare student"". Betsy dreaded talking to her mother much less having to face her at home.
    
At the start of their senior year, Betsy was forbidden from talking to Tom and her mother made sure that the school was aware of it. But they would write each other letters every day and slip them to each other. As soon as Tom would get home, he would pour over her letter even before he looked at the stock pages. 
    
Betsy’s mother had wanted to put her in a different school but her father would not allow it. Betsy kept getting more and more distressed. Tom wanted to ride in on a  white horse and rescue her, but he knew that there was nothing he could do. He felt helpless. 
    
When it was time for Senior Prom Bob visited the Mayfair Academy and made it clear that Betsy would attend the Prom with Tom, but his wife would not be informed. So they were able to have one final date at the Senior Prom, where their picture was taken. Tom felt like they were supposed to be together and if they could just wait this out, it would all work out.
    
In the last letter that Tom wrote to Betsy, shortly before graduation, he told her that he understood the pressure her mother was putting on her. He knew enough about her mother to know that if she didn't get what she wanted, neither Betsy nor her Dad would get a moment of peace. Both of them deserved better than that. He wanted Betsy to do what she felt she needed to do. He would understand and support her no matter what she decided. He loved her now and would always love her. Tom couldn't face her to give her the letter so he asked Tim to give it to her for him. 
    
Tom then decided what he needed to do. He had to graduate from Harvard. Let Betsy's mother turn her nose up at that. Tom talked to his Dad about what he wanted to do that night. Thomas figured that he would have to get a loan on the house but they would find a way to make it happen. He talked to Mr. Sullivan the next morning about what he was thinking. He wanted to offer Tommy that if he graduated in three years and kept his grade average up at a B or above, he would give him an all expenses trip to Paris for a month. That would be cheaper than paying for the extra year. Mr. Sullivan agreed that it was a good idea. Tommy always liked a good challenge. But he wanted to pay for his education and the trip. Thomas immediately began to object. 
     
Mr. Sullivan looked at him sternly and said ""Don't forget, I never take no for an answer. Didn't I tell you that Tommy was the grandson I didn't have a chance to have. I would do it for my grandson and I'm going to do it for Tommy. Don't take my joy away. Besides, I already have more money than I will be able to spend.""
    
As their days at the Mayfair Academy ended, Tom and Tim's paths continued to separate. Tom was wanting to attend Harvard and Tim was attending a smaller university closer to home known for its Journalism program. That way Tim and Suzy could attend college together.
    
So Tom started to fill out paperwork to be admitted to Harvard. When he told the counselor at Harvard he planned to graduate in three years, the counselor looked at him in disbelief. ""Most struggle to graduate in four years. And you want to do it in three? But you did come out of Mayfair with straight A's which is quite an accomplishment, so you may be able to do it.""
    
They figured out a schedule where Tom would take extra classes during the year then it would be possible to do it. Not easy by any means, but possible. The counselor told Tom that when it got to be overwhelming, he could reduce his schedule back to four years or longer.
    
In his dorm, Tom had two things prominently displayed over his desk. As he laid on his bed, he would look over at them. When he was tired of studying he would look up at them, and when he was tired in the morning not wanting to get out of bed, he would focus on them. One was a copy of the photo taken with Betsy at their Senior Prom that he had enlarged, and the other was a map of Paris. That was why he was doing what he was doing. And they were worth all that he was doing. When he felt like he could not do any more, he had a two mile route that he would run as fast as he could, then come back, take a shower, and then he was back at it. He didn't have the time to go out like a lot of the other students did, but he felt that he came for a purpose, not a party. He didn't feel like having a good time anyway. He really missed seeing Betsy, and the dinners on Sunday with his family and Mr. Sullivan, but he would be at home on the holidays when the school was closed.      
    
Tim would be at home at the same time so it gave them a chance to spend time together, and to catch up with what was going on. Tim was a reporter for the college paper. He loved it. He had found his calling.
    
Tom finally came to the end of his three years. He graduated and more importantly, he survived it. He had graduated with a 3.8 grade point average. So Tom had earned his Paris trip. He spent a month at home preparing then he was off on his adventure. His plan was to go without a plan. To live as cheaply as he could and stay as long as it lasted. He wanted to experience the culture.
    
When Tom arrived in Paris he wanted to find a room that was reasonably priced. He found the places close to the tourist attractions charged a huge premium so he avoided those. He came up with the idea that the artists would know of cheap places to get a room. He was strolling along a street where the artists were displaying their paintings. One artist caught his attention. How he painted, you felt you could walk right into the scene. 
    
Tom stopped and commented on his painting. Between the French that Tom knew and the English the artist knew, they were able to communicate. When Tom told him that he was looking for a place where he could stay for cheap, the artist said he had a roommate that had just moved out and Tom could stay there if he would like. Then he could help Tom with his French and Tom could help him with his English.
    
Tom took his things up to the little flat. It was not luxurious but very liveable. It had a charm to it. Now he was living like a Parisian. It was better than Tom could have dreamed. 
     
The artist's name was Jean Pierre DuBois. Jean Pierre explained it was pronounced like Jahn Pe-erre Du-Bwah. Just say it with a French accent and you have it. His family owned a small vineyard about an hour outside Paris in the country. The vineyard had been in his family as far back as anyone could remember, and he was sure that he would return to it one day, but for now his passion was his art. 
    
Tom and Jean Pierre soon worked out a schedule. Jean Pierre would paint in the mornings so Tom would go down to the news stand where they had the Wall Street Journal and then to a little coffee shop for an espresso with a croissant and check his stocks. Then around noon he would go back to the flat and he and Jean Pierre would go out to a cafe for lunch. 
    
Jean Pierre would sell his paintings in the afternoon and Tom would go sightseeing. Then in the evenings they would meet back at the flat for a light dinner and work on their language. 
    
Tom kept the picture of Betsy at his Senior Prom by his bed. Once Jean Pierre noticed it. He asked if Tom would like him to paint it. Tom said that he would be happy to pay him for ito. When Tom saw the finished painting, he almost started to cry. It was so beautiful. Jean Pierre had captured the emotions both he and Betsy were feeling. He couldn't have asked for more.
    
Jean Pierre asked Tom if he would like to visit the vineyard with him. He explained that it was time for harvest so everyone was needed. Harvest was an intense time because once the grapes reached their peak, they had to be harvested then. Any delay and the grapes would fade fast. Tom enjoyed learning that aspect of French culture. Wine had been such a factor of French life. 
    
Jean Pierre's mother fed them. It was easy to see that she enjoyed doting over her son. Tom's French had improved to where he was able to communicate with Jean Pierre's parents. He told them what an exceptional artist their son was. 
    
Tom was shown how to handle the grapes as they were being harvested. They had to be treated like little babies so they would not be bruised. That would affect the flavor of the wine. 
    
After the harvest Tom was shown the entire process from crushing the grapes to putting the new wine into the barrels to be aged. Now we wait and see. This was a good year. They were sure the wine would be a good one. It might even be good enough to win an award for this year. 
  
Tom could see why Jean Pierre said he would return to it. This could get into your blood. Tom wasn't sure it hadn't gotten into his already. 
    
When Tom was leaving, Jean Pierre's Dad gave him a case of wine. When Tom objected he was told there was a cellar full that he couldn't sell. They had already reduced the number of vines but were still producing more wine than they could sell. This gave Tom a new mission. He graduated Harvard as a Business major. He could solve this. Tom spent the next several days working on solutions. He came up with several.    
    
Next he needed to get in touch with Mr. Sullivan. With the time difference he may be in the office. He always liked to be there before anyone else. He called and he was right. Mr. Sullivan was the one who answered the phone. He was delighted to hear from Tom. How was his trip so far? Tom told him briefly what he was doing and that he was going to be able to extend his trip. Then he got to the reason for the call. Would Mr. Sullivan be interested in supplying French wine as part of his line? Tom broke down the cost and how the store that carried it would be able to make a good profit while selling it at a reasonable cost for the consumer. Mr. Sullivan was in. The next call Tom made was to Bob Turner, Betsy's Dad. How much would it cost to ship the wine? Tom figured all the costs and now was ready to talk to the DuBois family. 
    
As soon as Jean Pierre could, they returned to the vineyard. Tom then presented his proposals. Tom would purchase all the stock they had on hand, with that money they could take some of it to make part of the winery into a tasting room and gift shop. All they needed to do was to gravel in a parking area for cars and buses to park. In the tasting room they could sell the wine for a lot more than they were getting from the stores they were selling to now. Also in the gift shop they could sell souvenirs like wine glasses etched with the DuBois logo and other wine accessories. Tom told them that he would work with tour operators in Paris to get the vineyard on the tour routes. Before Tom left, the deal had been settled. After they left, Jean Pierre told Tom that he had never seen his Dad so excited. His Dad had been worried sick that he may have to be the one to shut the vineyard for the first time.
     
Tom kept his word about contacting the tour operators. He thought that Jean Pierre would be the better one but that was not the case. At the tour offices, they were excited to see him. They would recognize him as being an American and that was a large part of their market. When he suggested they put the DuBois Vineyard on their tours, they quickly checked where it was then agreed to. It was close enough to the city that it did not require an all day trip. Some even offered complimentary trips on some of their other tours to Tom.
    
Tom next thought since he was now importing wine, why not do the same with art. Jean Pierre had several pieces around the flat that had not sold. One Tom really liked. It was of an older couple walking through a park. You could see life had etched lines into their faces, but they were holding hands and the way they were looking at each other it was plain to see that they were still very much in love. The man in the picture reminded Tom a lot of Mr. Sullivan. That was going to be Tom's gift to Mr. Sullivan.
    
Tom talked to Jean Pierre about what his plan was. He would take all the unsold paintings to New York and pitch them to the galleries there like he did the winery to the tour companies. If they bought it, Jean Pierre could have half of what it sells for.
   
For Jean Pierre it was an opportunity too good to be true. For the galleries to just see his work was good enough for him, even if they did not purchase it. When the word got around to Jean Pierre's artist friends, they wanted to know if Tom would do the same for them. Tom realized he did not know enough about art for that. With Jean Pierre's art he liked it enough to buy it himself, but this was too much. Tom asked Jean Pierre to pick the pieces for him. He wanted good art, not as Jean Pierre had said, ""Just paint smeared on a canvas"". Jean Pierre agreed and another partnership was formed.
     
Tom then heard from Tim. He and Suzy were graduating in the spring and were planning a wedding in late June. Would Tom be able to make it? When Tom said he wouldn't miss it for his life, Tim asked if he would be his best man. Tom told him they could count on him.
    
The time in Paris was coming to a close. Tom sat back and thought about it for a moment. He had come looking to learn a little about the culture, and had learned so much more. His month had stretched into a year, and he had become a Parisian. He would miss it but he knew that he would be back again.

By the time Tom got back to New York, he had decided his passion was investing. He would work at it full time for himself and for someone else only if he had to. He was already nearly making enough from his portfolio to support himself so would need a little more to do it. 
    
When Tom gave his present of the painting to Mr. Sullivan, the man became teary eyed. As he looked intently, he said ""It's my Betty and me."" After that he always referred to the painting as ""My Betty and Me"". He hung it prominently in his office, since that is where he spent most of his time.
    
When Tom looked at the local newspaper, he was met with the headline ""Senator Colgate embroiled in scandal"". Tom read the story with interest. The Senator had allegedly had an affair with one of his campaign volunteers that had been only sixteen at the time. The girl became pregnant and refused to get an abortion. After the child was born, a paternity test proved that the Senator was the father. Senator Colgate made many claims from a lab mix up to a political attack, none of which he was ever able to prove. When this came out, several other young women came forward about his ‘inappropriate behavior’ with them while they were still underage. Tom remembered how Betsy always thought the son was creepy. Like father, like son.
    
In a follow up article after the election, it stated that although Senator Colgate had always won by large margins, in this election he had received less than 20% of the votes and had come in last. Senator Colgate's victory celebration would be on ice for some time to come. Tom had to admit that he had gotten a wicked sense of pleasure from those articles.
  
Tom named his company Vector Investments, off his middle name. Now he needed an office. He found exactly what he needed. It belonged to a brokerage company that had gotten in trouble and had gone bankrupt. They were selling it for a lot less than it was worth, and it was close to Wall Street and the Stock Exchange. 
    
Tom looked at the office and they were leaving several desks, all the phones, and much of the office equipment. It was a two story office with the reception and offices downstairs and upstairs a work and flex area that had a break room with a bathroom that had a shower. 
     
Tom realized there was enough room upstairs to remodel it into a small two bedroom apartment and still have enough room for a conference room. That way he would not have to rent an apartment.
     
Tom had part of the money he needed to buy the office but not all. Just starting his business, he would not be able to get a loan. So he did the only thing he knew to do. He visited Mr. Sullivan the next morning. He explained his plan, how he was going to make the second story into an apartment to avoid paying rent, how everything he needed for the business was being left, and if he fell on his face, he could sell it for more than what he would owe. After a pause, Mr. Sullivan said ""Tommy, you have really thought this through. You have covered your bases well. Besides, I believe in you. I will loan you what you need."" 
    
Tom offered a five year payback, but Mr. Sullivan countered back with at least ten. ""Don't cut yourself short. You can get yourself in trouble like that."" They settled on a ten year payback.

Tom then went to the owners and told them he wanted to purchase the office. He would have the cash in a few days. The owners were thrilled to be finished with it and be able to put it behind them. They then told Tom that they had been working with someone else but they kept dragging their feet and wound up not coming through in the end after several months. That is why they had dropped the price so low.
    
Tom started approaching investors and asked them to place a portion of their investments with him to manage. If he didn't beat the returns they were receiving, he would personally make up the shortage. But if he beat the returns they were receiving, he expected to receive a larger share of their investments. Everyone agreed and Tom was on his way. 
    
Tom met with Bob Turner about his investments. When Tom asked casually about Betsy, Bob got a sad look on his face and looked at the floor. Tom could tell it was not good, so he quickly changed the topic.
    
Tom moved into his new office and soon realized he needed someone to help him. The first person he called was Tim. Would Tim be interested? Tim told him he had just been hired as a reporter for a Wall Street newspaper. But Suzy was still looking. Maybe she would be interested. Suzy turned out to be the perfect person, more like a business partner for him. 
    
Tom and Suzy worked really well together. Suzy's Mom still worked as Mr. Sullivan's personal secretary. It seemed Suzy inherited her mother's organizational skills. Suzy had the office humming in no time. Suzy had a way of disagreeing with Tom that was pleasant. In a way that caused Tom to rethink what he had just said or was about to do. She saved him from making some grave mistakes. 
    
As Tom had more large investors come on, he started changing investment strategies. Instead of just purchasing stock in a company and tracking it, he could now buy large interests in companies and play a role in their management. He now wanted to return to Harvard for his MBA. He grouped his classes together on the same days so he could commute for his classes and be at the office the rest of the time.
    
Tom did not push this degree, but enjoyed the experience to the full. His Professors enjoyed having the real life input, and the challenges he faced. And he was learning things that he could apply to his business right away.
    
He still would spend Sundays with his parents and Mr. Sullivan was still visiting his grandmother. It was nice to be able to spend time with them again. That was one thing he missed when he was in Paris. 
    
One of the galleries that was buying Jean Pierre's paintings called him in a panic. An artist they had scheduled for a show had just canceled. Would Jean Pierre be able to cover it? Tom told them he would let them know as soon as he could. He then called Jean Pierre. Would he be willing to cover a show at a gallery in New York? The gallery was willing to cover his airfare and Jean Pierre could stay with him the entire time he was there. Jean Pierre said he would be there. Tom told him to bring all the paintings he had. The show was a huge success. With his French look and accent, Jean Pierre had people falling all over him. Most of his paintings sold and he was commissioned to do several others. 
    
Jean Pierre became part of the family while he was there. He would spend Sundays at the Wolfe home, and Tom made the conference room into an artist studio. It had the good morning light that Jean Pierre loved. After a few months there, Jean Pierre told Tom that he had to go home soon. It was harvest time at the vineyard. Tom thought about it, he was still on break from school, Suzy could handle the office for a week, and he hadn't taken a vacation since he had been back. Tom asked Jean Pierre if he could join him for the harvest. That would be fantastic. So Tom returned to France, promising everyone he would not be gone as long this time.
    
The DuBois' gave Tom a hero's welcome. Jacques, Jean Pierre's Dad showed him around. All the vines that had been removed were now replanted. They no longer had a cellar full of wine they couldn't sell, actually they now were selling more through the tasting room alone than they were in the years before to merchants. And they were considering purchasing surrounding acreage to enlarge the vineyard.
    
Tom found out that once you know how to harvest the grapes, you don't forget. The week passed quickly and he enjoyed every second of it. But he felt like he had left his baby at home. He was ready to get back to work.
    
Tom finished his MBA and his business was growing. He was taking a more active role in the companies that he had ownership interest in. One thing he learned from Mr. Sullivan was that you have to talk to the employees. That is where Tom spent most of his time when he visited the companies. He knew not to go in as a big shot. He would dress casually and catch them on breaks or at lunch. The employees thought he was one of them, so would open up when he asked questions.   
    
Many had great ideas as to how to make improvements and to streamline the process they were working on. It seemed like they never had anyone listen to them before, not even ask them if they had an idea. Once their idea was implemented, Tom made sure the employee received credit for it. If the company refused to make the changes, he would quietly sell off the stock in it he controlled. He knew the company was headed for hard times.
    
Tom would do something similar when he was at the office. He liked eating at a restaurant that was popular with the stock brokers that worked on the floor of the Stock Exchange. He would make sure to get there before they got busy and would get a table close to the door. When the stock brokers came in, they were trying to get in and out as quickly as possible so he would invite one to share his table. While they were waiting for their order, he would ask vague questions, and mention the market seemed to be a little volatile at the moment. As they would eat the broker may mention specifics that he was observing. Tom gleaned a lot of valuable tips this way.
    
Tom was wanting to get away more and more on the weekends. He had found a quiet town only about 45 miles out of the city that had rolling hills and a few vineyards in the area. It reminded Tom of the area around the DuBois' vineyard. He felt a real connection to the town right away. Tom always stayed at a little BnB that was run by the county assessor and his wife. When Tom mentioned that he would like to eventually purchase property there, the man told him of a place outside of town that was about to be taken for back taxes. Tom might be able to get a good deal on it and it would save the assessor a lot of hassle and paperwork. He would show Tom where it was if he would like. 
    
Later that day, Tom went with him to the place. It was out of town on a country road. The man admitted he didn't know a lot about it except what he heard around town. It had been built by an industrialist just before WWll, and he had been a stickler for privacy. He had bought 640 acres there and built his home. He didn't want anyone around and was known to be a recluse. Nobody could remember seeing him for the last twenty years or so. As they walked around the property, Tom couldn't believe it. Although the vegetation had grown up, the place was still in good shape. He tried looking through the windows, but couldn't see much. The house sat up on a  hill overlooking a small lake. Behind the main house there was a guest house and gardens. What sold him was there was a grape arbor with vines that were still producing. 
    
Down the hill closer to the lake was what looked like an office of some type with a rather large shop building attached to it. Tom wasn't sure what it was but would check into it. He wanted to dig into this deeper. He liked this property. He started calling it ""Oak Knolls"" for the oak trees covering the rolling hills or knolls. Tom spent the next few weekends in the town. He started combing the past editions of the local newspaper. Gradually he uncovered the story.
    
George Converse had been an industrialist in the 20’s and 30's and had many government contracts leading into the War. He had become increasingly fearful of the Nazi reach and their ability. So he bought a large parcel of land there to avoid detection. He had retired in the early 1960's then started to travel the world. It was his goal to visit as many countries on each continent that he could. He would often go on safaris and big game hunting trips. Then on one of his many trips, he contracted a tropical disease. He never returned home.
    
Tom then heard of a man now living at the local nursing home that had been there during the construction of the site. Tom had to at least try to talk to this man. He was now in his 90's, so Tom wasn't sure what to expect. It turned out that the man was still mentally alert, and remembered the project well. He said he was there for the construction and it was his first job. He later worked in the factory. Tom asked what factory? The man chuckled and commented that they did a pretty good job keeping it a secret. There was a munitions factory that was there. Mr. Converse had it buried. They had dug down over 45 feet and put in 18 inch concrete walls. He then paused and said, have you seen the little lake out there? We had to do something with all the dirt we were digging so we built a dam. They said it was for flood control, but it was to get rid of all the dirt. And Mr. Converse put a hydro generator in it that supplied the factory with electricity.
    
The old man took a big sip of his coffee then continued. There were two levels of the factory, connected with an elevator. You would never know. Supplies would come in, the trucks would pull into the shop building and they would close the doors so nobody could see in. The truck would be unloaded and the materials would be loaded onto the elevator and taken down to the workers. The mutations would be loaded onto the truck, then the truck would pull out and nobody ever figured out what was going on there. It was then time for the old man's lunch so Tom said goodbye to him. The man apologized for talking so much. Tom told him he thoroughly enjoyed it and he learned history he never would have otherwise. 
    
Tom decided that he had enough information and wanted to purchase the property. Tom contacted the person listed on the tax records and found out it was George Converse's nephew. His father had a major falling out with George when they were both young men over a business deal and he had never heard anything good about George. The only thing that he knew about it was that he had gotten some letters from New York demanding money and he didn't have any. Tom offered him $500,000 cash for the entire property and Tom would take care of all the back taxes and costs. The nephew asked how soon he would receive the money. It was a deal.
     
It was only after he bought the property that Tom finally saw inside the structures. Both homes were in amazing shape. They needed updating but were structurally sound. The homes were built by craftsmen, expense was not spared on materials. 
    
Tom started with the guest house replacing all the windows, plumbing, and fixtures. Then he had all the wiring updated throughout. When that was finished he started doing the same with the main house and stayed in the guest house on the weekends. The place was taking shape nicely with the grounds cleaned up, and all the trees and bushes trimmed.
    
When Tom started in the main house it was exactly as it was left when George left on his last trip. There was  even wine left in the pantry. A treasure for Tom was the library that was there. George had a thirst for knowledge as seen in his selection. By the time he finished. The property was returned to its former glory. It was ready for Tom to move in.

1qdq6of,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qdq6of,Yesterday was a REALLY Witchy Day!,"So, I’ve been trying to feed the crows to connect with them for…more than a month now that I think about it. But the weather kept getting in the way by getting the food soaked or frozen over, the dogs kept stealing my offerings, and the fear of getting in trouble with the store security kept me from leaving food offerings in REALLY crowded parking lots. Aka: Basically every parking lot I was in. Well, on my merchandiser route yesterday, I had my jar of peanuts, and it was an early morning shift, it was really foggy, and I FINALLY had a place to put the food without being seen! (Once again, scared of getting in trouble with store staff, or admittedly getting questioned by customers.) I put the peanuts down in one of the parking lots, and I came back, AND THEY’D EATEN IT! I put more for them down and drove to the next store, but it wasn’t until the last store on my route that I could repeat it. Plus, I picked up some bottles that were littering the area, which will make GREAT spell bottles, and at each feeding spot, I also found a frozen over pigeon feather! And at the final store, I came back, and the crows were still walking around my car! I didn’t want to scare them off, and I didn’t run at them, but…well, I had to get to my car eventually. I put more food (finished off the jar, it wasn’t a very big one and the unsalted peanuts were pretty big.) and parked further away and waited in the car for about 10-15 minutes. They didn’t come back, but again, unfortunately, had to leave sometime that day. I wanted to wait longer, but I was exhausted from work and had a 30 minute drive to get home. But hey, a magickal day nonetheless!!! And I am SO GLAD THAT THE WEATHER FINALLY DIDN’T GET IN THE WAY OF MY FOOD OFFERINGS! Oh, and one final thing: I was going to ask my partner for some coffee beans from work for an abundance spell bag I have planned for the new moon on Sunday, and yet, 3 stores had coffee beans on the ground for me to gather!!!

You can spend all day texting me but when it comes to showing up, the effort outweighs the enjoyment. Meanwhile I can’t help but look forward to every maybe. I dress my best (cute but not too cute), check my hair, stay away from coffee, and instead of you I’m faced with an empty seat. With a stranger asking ‘is this seat taken?’ A friend texting asking if I’m up for a last-minute lunch. 

But it’s no problem! I had a lot to get on with anyway!

Besides, I’m so desperate to not come across as needy, to not put pressure on a friendship that isn’t quite a friendship and isn’t quite more and isn’t quite less, that I’ll never say anything. I’ll reply with a joke and try to pretend that on my side of the screen my eyes aren’t burning with tears.

1qdq2ut,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/1qdq2ut/first_week_of_exposure_therapy_and_i_hit_a_wall/,"First week of exposure therapy, and I hit a wall today","I'm posting on a different account. I don't really want anyone to know me, but I want to reach out to someone who may understand. I feel alone.

My therapist thinks I (30, F) have agoraphobia, possibly caused by trauma. I had gotten FMLA for panic attacks in November and have intermittent FMLA until February. I've been having panic attacks for years but the last year or so its gotten to the point that I can't go to the store or work or anywhere I used to enjoy because I get sick with anxiety and stress. To be honest, I think being out on FMLA has sort of enabled my tendency to stay home because my anxiety over leaving is worse than ever.

My therapist discussed exposure therapy, and easing back into being part of the world. I'm not entirely housebound. I can go to stores with my partner, though I'm usually in this state of tunnel vision and ringing ears until I'm back in the car or at home. It's become a very in and out ordeal that is annoying for everyone involved, I'm sure. I can also go pick up books and movies on hold at the library (takes less than thirty minutes including drive time) but still with that same degree of discomfort.

  
I've been easing into exposure therapy the last week. I've been trying to sit in discomfort. I used to not be able to sit on my porch other than to let my dog out, but yesterday I was able to drink a whole cup of coffee before going back inside. I've also been opening my blinds for small periods of time (I dont know if its related to agoraphobia, but it leaves me scared and exposed and im trying to work through anything that makes me uncomfortable). I also was able to walk my dog for ten minutes this week. I even made it on the street for a moment.

I was supposed to return to work in the new year, but I've only been able to come to a couple half day shifts this week. I've called out the last couple of days. I've been pretty upfront with my boss and I luckily work in an environment thats relatively supportive, but I feel like I'm letting everyone down. My boss has me on half days right now because its less daunting this week, but ive called out yesterday and today, after coming in two days in a row. I feel like I've let all progress out the window today. Taking my dog out for three minutes felt like too much. The blinds open is too much. I meet with my therapist today and I feel like I've let her down, my work down, myself down. I used to be so adventurous and now sitting on the porch feels like victory. I'm trying to push through and I'm trying so hard but I hit a wall today and yesterday and I'm trying to land back on my feet.

Prior to his birthday, I had asked if he wanted to do a dinner date on me and birthday sex after and he told me his birthday was the last thing he was thinking about (his car broke down on the way home but he made it home. I told him I could take him to work and we'll figure it out but he brushed me off and said I'll deal with it), and he said he didn't want to do anything on his birthday. I said okay im sorry for mentioning it. He texted the next day he was sorry for being a grouch and I said thank you for saying that. The next day he said he had a lot going on and said he needed space. I didnt celebrate his birthday with him and gave him his space but I still went out of my way to give him a card with stickers and a gc to in and out. I dropped off the card with our mutual friend and his roommate. Later he texted saying thank you and invited me to go eat at an Asian buffet but I had just eaten dinner and said no but to enjoy it with his friend. For a week since I still gave him his space until I saw him to meet up with out mutual friend and he barely interacted with me. I texted him later and asked if he was still requiring space and he said no im sorry and he was good now. I asked him the next day if he wanted to get a coffee and told me he was busy cleaning and doing laundry and he had to be asleep at a certain time. I was upset that he couldn't make time to see me (he had 4 hours before his proposed bedtime and I told him he didnt have to drink coffee. They sell other drinks) and then we got into an argument about how we havent spent any quality time together in over a month like when are we going to see each other, do you even want to see me? And he kept saying im tired from work, i come home and clean and sleep, im sorry I cant give you what you want rn until im settled with work and my life. It appeared we broke up but then the next day he texted good morning and said he was drunk at work from night before bc he was upset. I told him to sober up and asked later if he made it home and he didn't respond. The day after he texted good morning again and asked if we were still together and I was confused and told him I still love and want to be with you and he acknowledge that. The next day just a simple good morning and I said it back and thats all we said. Today, its my bday and there's no good morning text or happy birthday message. Having said all that, i wonder if him not saying anything is ultimate dealbreaker and we should finally call it quits. ",1,1768498530.0,dating,8,0.6,False

I prepare beddings months in advance because why not. 

Here is my recipe. 
- shredded cardboard  
- coffee grounds  
- some dried leaves  
- egg shells (optional)
- worm tea or leachate from the castings for inoculation
- sticks to create air gaps

Observations:
- undergoes hot composting for around 2 weeks
- loses the greasy texture and strong aroma from the fresh coffee grounds after hot compost
- results to a damp and crumbly bedding. The carboards don't clump together with the presence of the coffee grounds
- coffee grounds provide plenty of grit making egg shells optional for grit
- 

Result:
 I find that this bedding is easily turned into castings and turns into nice, crumbly castings. It is inert and very stable and I did not see any issue.

**\* If you did not read Part 1 I highly recommend starting here:** [A Sneak Peek Of The Eufy Omni S2 Robot Vacuum! Welcome to the Future Of Robot Vacuum Technology! Part 1 of 2 : r/RobotVacuums](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/1qdom8r/a_sneak_peek_of_the_eufy_omni_s2_robot_vacuum/)

**\*Disclosure: As I mentioned in Part 1 of 2, Eufy sent me the S2 free of charge for beta testing purposes. They reached out and asked if I would be willing to share my user experience. All statements contains herein are my own.**

**Hot Water Mop Washing of the S2**

The base station now includes 140° F hot water mop washing and washes the mop with electrolyzed water with a 99.99% bacterial removal rate. Through my testing, it has performed flawlessly and I haven't noted any issues. Additionally, the debris tray has been slightly redesigned and looks to be the same design as the Eufy E25/E28 which I have had some experience with as well. I have noticed less debris left over after the mop is washed at the base station vs my S1 Pro. There are 2 options for drying that can be selected under Base Station Settings. The S2 has 131° F of hot air drying for the mop. ""Standard Dry"" is 4.5 hours and ""Quick Dry"" is 3 hours and is suitable for dry areas. So, if you live in a more humid area, I recommend ""Standard Dry"" to ensure your mop is dried properly. I have mine set under Standard Dry and have never found that the mop is still wet.

**Edge Cleaning with the S2**

While overall, the S1 Pro does a good job with edge cleaning, it left a little to be desired for some users. That’s where the extending mops comes in to the picture! The S2 has the capability to do a fantastic job of edge cleaning! It's hard for the S1 Pro to compete with an extending roller mop, right? When I first received the S2 and put it to work, it was apparent the extending mop right out of the box was going to need feedback from beta testers to really help fine tune the edge cleaning. That’s what beta testing is all about though. I have personally submitted multiple videos and measurements to the engineers to continue improving it.

With our user input, Eufy has now refined the edge cleaning and is continuing to fine tune it right up until the S2’s major launch. It is performing much better than where it started, but can still use some optimization. I’ve still experienced some issues with it tracking straight along the edge of a wall or cabinets, and also some issues with it not knowing when to retract the mop as the robot makes a turn. The extending mop will occasionally catch on a corner or furniture leg. I have forwarded this information to the engineers and they continue to work on it.

Firmware updates are being released rapidly before the major launch and we're expecting another firmware update this weekend as long as internal testing goes well. In talking with the engineers, I know this is a major focus of theirs and a high priority item on their list right now to improve. Eufy wants it to be right for the end user and I have no doubt it will be perfected. The great news is the hardware is there to make it happen!

As I mentioned earlier, I purchased an S1 Pro very early on as a Kickstarter backer and before it was released to the public. When I first received that machine it was afraid to go underneath my kitchen cabinets and would stay about 6 inches away from the edge. Therefore, edge cleaning was very poor. I was able to talk directly to some of the engineers on Discord and pass my issues to them. They listened to the issues that were presented to them, and made the needed improvements. The S1 Pro now cleans underneath my cabinet toe kicks and as close to the edge as it can every time. I truly have been satisfied with Eufy's determination and passion to make their product the best it can possibly be and I have no doubt they will continue optimizing edge cleaning even after launch.

I know there is a final launch version firmware update planned that will be pushed to my machine and I look forward to testing it to see the improvements.

**Mopping with the S2**

Mopping is fantastic and builds off of the same technology as the S1 Pro. I'm a huge believer in the roller mop technology that Eufy has designed. In my past testing, I learned spinning mop pads and drag behind mop pads did not provide the same level of dirt extraction as Eufy's HydroJet technology and simply redistributed a large percentage of the dirt to other parts of the flooring. If you want true dirt extraction off of the floor, in my experience Eufy's roller mop technology is the way to go.

* Improvements for the S2 with the HydroJet 2.0 Mopping system include increased downward mopping pressure from 10N on the S1 Pro to 15N on the S2.
* 32 water injection ports clean the roller mop in real time and a second scraper has been added to remove debris off of the mop in real time.
* Electrolyzed water is made out of tap water at the base station and then injected in to the clean water tank of the robot. The electrolyzed water provides a 99.9% sterilization rate according to Eufy specs.
* 240 RPM's for the S2 roller mop vs. 170 RPM's for the S1 roller mop.

In my testing I have found the S2 does a very good job of maintaining your floors. I clean every room at least 5x per week and my kitchen gets cleaned on the 2x setting during the morning cleanings. I have a second cleaning for the kitchen that I perform every night around 9:30pm once the kitchen is “closed for business”.

Overall, the S2 has done a great job of maintaining my wood-look tile downstairs and the tile looks spotless. The other thing I have noticed is that my grout has remained cleaner using the S1 Pro and S2 than when I used a mop and bucket. The traditional hand mopping tends to push the water in to the grout and not get extracted. The S2 uses less water and does not push dirty water in to the grout lines. I do still clean my grout a few times a year with a commercial grade orbiter scrubbing machine to maintain it. I’ve noticed the main areas I need to do this are in the kitchen where spills occur.

Also, what I have noticed is if I run across a really hard stuck on stain or debris the S2 did not mop up, it’s usually something that I have to go over multiple times with a traditional mop to even get it off of the floor. So, it does an overall good job with fresher stains and that’s where routine cleaning with the S2 can help prevent this.

I think the key to maintaining your floors is to schedule regular S2 cleanings 3-5 times per week depending on how many people live in your household, how many pets you have etc. I personally clean all areas at least 5 days a week and some areas get cleaned 7 days a week. The S2 has saved us an unbelievable amount of time.

**S2 Corner Rover Arm Extended Reach**

The S2 includes several features I personally had on my wish list. One of those features is the Corner Rover Arm that now extends in to the corners to provide better cleaning coverage.

Through my testing over the last several months I have seen a noticeable improvement in corner cleaning ability over the S1 Pro. However, I think it can still be perfected even further. While the S1 Pro is no slouch, the new Extend Reach Corner Rover Arm does a much better job tackling corners than the S1 Pro does. I find less debris trapped in corners since I have been using the S2.

I plan to include corner cleaning in my future video content to give you real world examples.

The side brush design is slightly different than the S1 Pro and will not be interchangeable. The S1 Pro brushes ""snap"" in place, and the S2 brushes screw in place. I was able to get 6 months use out of the side brushes on the S2 and just replaced them as accessories are now available on the Eufy website and Amazon. So, as far as maintaining the side brushes, this is similar to the S1 Pro from my experience.

**S2 Carpet Cleaning and 30,000 Pa AeroTurbo 2.0 Long-Lasting Suction**

I know many of you are wondering if those numbers translate to real world improvement. From my testing, the S2 does have more obvious suction power. Something interesting about it, is that it is actually quieter than the S1 Pro with the increased suction power.

The first time I ran it on Max suction mode on my carpet upstairs, I was absolutely blown away by the amount of dust, debris, and hair it pulled out of the carpet. After the cleaning, and before I returned it to the base station, I pulled the dust bin to check the results. It was completely full!

Approximately a week later I performed another carpet cleaning upstairs with the S2 on Max mode. The S2 yet again surprised me and was still able to pull more debris out of the carpet. When I pulled the dust box this time it was around the half way full mark. Impressive to say the least that it pulled so much extra debris out of the carpet. Keep in mind the S1 Pro was the robot I had been using to clean that same carpet before I received the S2.

I performed multiple tests on my tiled areas as well with debris like oatmeal, coffee grounds, flour and sugar and other items. The S2 overall does a very good job extracting these materials off of the floor. I did note that you may need to set it on a 2x cleaning to extract everything. Also, there were a few times I did need to go over the area with a second cleaning to pick up a few pieces the S2 missed on the first pass.

However, I placed a large amount of debris that I think any robot vacuum would struggle with extracting up completely. I really wanted to test the improved suction power of the S2 in these tests.

For larger messes, it’s generally a good idea to use a traditional broom or vacuum to sweep up in my experience with using robot vacuums. They do have their limitations.

That’s where the S2 really shines for daily, routine cleaning of your home.

Next on my list is an exciting feature that has been added to the S2. The ability for the robot to lift the chassis up to 5 cm or almost 2 inches to climb on to carpet and rugs is a game changer for people with a lot of thick carpet and rugs.

I have several rugs downstairs and the S2 has done a fantastic job of recognizing when it needs to lift the chassis to climb on to rugs.

The S2 will clean the around the border of the rug first, and then proceed to clean the interior of the rug. This is an improved cleaning pattern and I haven’t experienced any issues with the S2 “eating” the rug.

Additionally, the S2 has been programmed to avoid tassels on carpet and I have tested this as well with very good results. The robot will avoid entering the rug on the tassel area and proceed to enter from an area that does not have tassels. I was able to test this with my entry rug. It has tassels on 2 sides and no tassels on the other 2 sides. The S2 performed as Eufy explained that it should and entered the rug from the border that does not contain tassels and then proceeded to clean from there.

Most of the rugs in my downstairs area are low pile and the S2 has conquered those with ease while providing excellent dust extraction.  

I do have a bath mat that is much thicker and the S2 has been able to climb on to it without any issues and perform a cleaning.

Another shining star of this whole new setup is the S2’s new and improved air filtration system. It’s a 3-step air filtration system, that is a massively improved design over the S1 Pro air filtration. With the S1 Pro my high performance air filter was routinely full of dust and it needed to be cleaned weekly to maintain proper suction power. With the S2, you’re absolutely going to be able to go much longer periods of time before needing to clean or replace the air filter. Very little dust actually makes its way to the paper filter of the S2 now. I’m using the same filter as I started with 6 months ago and it’s not showing any signs of needing replacement at this point. It truly is an amazing upgrade!

**DuoSpiral Zero-Tangle Design**

I do want to take a moment to talk about the DuoSpiral brush. It has been impressive and has performed flawlessly. Over the course of 6 months, I have never had to remove a strand of hair out of the brush. My wife and daughter both have long hair and with the S1 Pro, I removed hair off the ends of the roller brush on a weekly basis. This is going to be a massive improvement for anyone with pets as well.

**Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance**

I mentioned earlier that I’ve had the opportunity to test the obstacle avoidance with multiple different types of cables with excellent results. Additionally, I’ve tested it with small objects including small kid toys and the S2 has done an excellent job of avoiding most of those items. I haven’t had any of those items accidentally ran over by the S2. Eufy’s website mentions

One area I have noted can still use some improvement in terms of navigation is around my kitchen barstools. I have 4 barstools located at my kitchen island that are dark colored. The S1 Pro has done a fantastic job navigating these in the past. The S2 has had some struggles with bumping in to these chairs, and at times seemingly becoming slightly confused on how to get itself out of the scenario. I’ve never had to “rescue” the S2 from this area, but I have noted a few times that it needed some time to “think” about the best escape route. The barstool legs are a bit of a maze. I’ve provided this feedback to the engineering team, and they are continuing to improve this area. I will continue testing with the next firmware updates.

 

**Fragrance Diffuser**

As I was sitting here writing this review the S2 was performing a cleaning in my office. As it passed by me, I could smell the fragrance diffuser and it reminded me to write about the new fragrance addition. Overall, I think this is a nice optional addition to the S2. You do not have to install a fragrance, but I can tell you the fragrance is not overpowering and adds a nice scent while cleaning. I have tested all of the current options which are: Citrus and Basil, Bamboo and Sage, and Bergamot and Lychee. My personal favorite is probably Citrus and Basil mainly because I really love citrus smells.

**Automatic Mess Detection**

I’m told by Eufy that currently the only 2 items that are recognized by this feature are ketchup and coffee with more additions coming in the future. Early on I tried testing spilled coffee recognition on my tile floor. I conducted this test in zone cleaning mode and the robot failed the test. Eufy engineers told me this function is not available in zone cleaning, only room cleaning when I provided the feedback.

So, last week I tried a room cleaning with ketchup on the floor. The S2 failed this test. The robot is supposed to lift the sweeper brush along with the vacuum roller brush to avoid the liquid being sucked in to the dust box and inside the robot. This will also keep from spreading the liquid across the floor with the side sweeper brush.

As I came to this section to write about this feature, I decided to conduct another test with ketchup on my tile floor in room cleaning mode. Again, the S2 failed to raise the vacuum roller and side brush. Ketchup was sucked up inside the vacuum roller brush guard. I did film this and will be providing this feedback to Eufy to continue working on improvements.

I was told last week this feature is still being refined, and laboratory results may be better at this time vs. real world cleanings.

**Maintenance**

As I touched on throughout the review, maintenance has been reduced on the S2 as compared to the S1 Pro. The new air filtration is a big upgrade and barely needs to be cleaned. Based on my testing, I believe the new system can go for very long periods without any maintenance at all. I occasionally would pull the round paper filter to check it and very little dust if any comes off of it.

For myself, I got in such a habit of just doing weekly maintenance on my S1 Pro that I continued over that mindset to the S2. The S1 Pro water filter would clog about every 7-10 days from debris if it wasn’t cleaned.

From my testing, the S2 dirty water tank filter doesn’t seem to need cleaning as often. I generally only spend 10-15 minutes every 2-3 weeks now conducting maintenance on the S2, minus needing to refill the clean water tank, and empty the dirty water tank. Also, don’t forget to clean the debris tray itself, and underneath the debris tray. Also, it doesn’t hurt to clean around the base station to keep everything looking tidy.

The vacuum bag can last several months before needing replacing as well. So, Eufy has greatly reduced overall maintenance with the S2.

Also, I think it’s worth noting again that I believe the decreased debris in the dirty water filter is a direct result of the increased vacuum suction power. Less debris seems to be getting picked up by the mop and then in to the dirty water filter. I don’t experience the clogs I had with the S1 Pro. Of course, your results may vary depending on your cleaning environment. Keep in mind, I do not have pets but do have 4-5 people in my household on a regular basis.

Overall, maintenance is very easy and absolutely worth the 10-15 minutes you will spend on it every 2-3 weeks.

**Auto Refill**

The great news is the S2 has auto refill capability and an auto refill kit can be purchased separately if you so desire. I have an auto refill kit on hand, but I haven’t had the opportunity yet to install it and test it out. It is something I plan on doing in the very near future and this will greatly reduce your maintenance of the S2 as well.

 

**Conclusion**

I have put a lot of thought and time in to writing this review of the S2. I have spent a lot of time with the S2 to get an understanding of its capabilities. I truly hope it gives you a look in to the new improvements Eufy has made to its flagship model and helps you figure out if it’s the right robot for you. Aside from some of the current weaknesses, I personally believe the S2 can be the best robot on the market at launch with some slight firmware refinements from the engineers.

Eufy has made major hardware updates to the S2 and it’s a true Swiss army knife! It doesn’t just do one task well, it does many tasks well including carpet cleaning. The air filtration is a major leap forward in innovation especially if you have pets. The Duo-Spiral brush has become essentially maintenance free!

Also, I believe if you have a large amount of mopping the S2 is the best robot for your needs.

Carpet Cleaning is much improved as well and I will try to post some test results if I can for you. I think you will be very happy with the additional suction power, ability to climb on to high pile carpet, and the reduced maintenance on the new air filtration system.

I believe if Eufy can add a mop only feature, along with a mop first, then vacuum feature the S2 will be the most complete robot vacuum on the market. I do know these 2 features are currently being tested but I can’t guarantee they will be included. However, I think there’s a very good chance based on conversations with Eufy.

I know there are probably some areas I forgot to review and will try to include in future posts.

Please feel free to comment, upvote, ask questions! Also, if there is any specific content you would like to see, make a suggestion and I will try to cover it on my next post.

Last, but not least, if you made it this far thank you for taking the time to read my review and put your trust in me to give you an inside look at the S2!

**\*\*\*A new firmware update was released this morning on 1/15/2026. I have updated my S2 to it and will continue further testing. I have been working on this review the past few days and up to this point had been using the latest firmware.**

Please, hold the applause. 😎🤚 

In this post, I’m going over one of Ryan McBeth’s recent videos: [Foreign Actors Turned a Tragedy Into an Information Weapon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_crFFBfnJo). 

[**This post is best read on Medium**](https://medium.com/@Splemndid/ryan-mcbeth-mislabels-outrage-over-renees-killing-as-a-russian-bot-campaign-48b499b6a7a3)**, as relevant screenshots and embeds are provided throughout, so you don’t need to trouble yourself with opening up too many links.**  

# 🚨TL;DR:🚨

[Ryan’s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_crFFBfnJo) sought to examine how foreign adversaries were manipulating the information space surrounding the killing of [Renee Nicole Good](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/10/us/rennee-good-ice-shooting-minnesota.html). While the general claim that these adversaries will seek to exploit partisan divides in the US is true, there are major problems with Ryan’s video due to an over-reliance on Cyabra, a bot detection software.

* Ryan claimed that authentic users tweeting about the incident using the phrase “Renee Nicole Good” directed their anger towards Trump, whereas inauthentic users using that phrase manufactured fake outrage towards ICE. He thus alleged that *foreign adversaries* were having a significant effect on engineering that fake outrage. 
* However, Cyabra mislabeled real people as inauthentic accounts, and returned results that were not relevant to the incident. Ryan simply took the data at face-value, drawing potentially inaccurate conclusions. 
* Ryan noted that various political figures and viral tweets were using the term “legal observer” when referring to Renee. He claimed it was ""part of a script"" and that ""some sort of talking points \[were\] sent out."" This is similar to what [Libs of TikTok tweeted](https://archive.li/zQky3), who said that the “narrative went out” and that someone was writing “identical talking points for the Democrats.” 
* Neither of them took note of the fact that early accounts from local reporters and city council members who spoke to witnesses claimed that Renee was an observer, and it was from there that the term spread from viral tweet to viral tweet.

# The Process Matters

This post is going to be ripe for misinterpretation, so let me clarify: I am *not* saying foreign adversaries/Russian bots don’t attempt to manipulate the information space. Duh, of course they do, I’ve posted about Kremlin propaganda campaigns before, [\[1\]](https://archive.li/ueDAG) [\[2\]](https://archive.li/3NruI) and addressed [Russian misinformation](https://archive.li/Qe2rA) spewed from RFK Jr. on Lex Fridman’s podcast.

Identifying these bot farms or sockpuppets run by foreign adversaries like Russia is important — but it’s also important not to *misidentify* them. [Let me quote from Destiny here](https://archive.ph/MshV6) about misinformation surrounding the [killing of Breonna Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Breonna_Taylor):

>However, starting that discussion with an incorrect description of what happened weakens our arguments against those on the right that disagree with us. This is because we now have to begin by making concessions about lies or misrepresentations from people who purport to agree with us. Furthermore, it casts doubt about the truth of the rest of the argument for those in the middle who are unsure of where the fault lies.

Ryan, a Newsmax commentator, got into [an argument with users here](https://archive.li/tpU3p) when they tagged him about an AI clip that Newsmax fell for — [which they still haven’t taken down](https://youtu.be/89zLz9ujexA?t=55). (He later made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW1qKE92fKM) about the AI clip, claiming that it “fooled the pros.” To be frank, this is utterly wrong, there weren’t any “pros” that fell for that AI slop.) 

Quoting from one of Ryan’s comments in that Reddit thread (emphasis added):

>Did you research the video question? Did you run it through an AI detector? Or are you just taking this animated GIF as face value? I am saying what I’m saying because I haven’t done any of those things. I just woke up. I just got my coffee. I haven’t researched anything. Have you? **Are you a good consumer of media or are you going to take this video at face value?**

Well, the same applies to Ryan’s videos. I’m merely examining what was presented rather than taking it at face value.

Finally, you might be interested in these other critiques I wrote a couple years ago, where I make similar points as I do in this post:

* [Ryan McBeth's investigation into the EndWokeness and Jack Posobiec Twitter accounts is deeply flawed and it should probably be retracted. (Or update the YouTube description.) ](https://archive.li/NYpZv)
* [Ryan McBeth's collaboration video with a MAGA Republican falsely claims that Trump cares about the struggle of the Ukrainian people. (+Other criticisms)](https://archive.li/nt9CV)

# Foreign Adversaries or Real Outrage?

There's two major problems in the [segment](https://youtu.be/x_crFFBfnJo?t=468) where Ryan covers inauthentic accounts who were manufacturing fake outrage against ICE:

* The percentage of inauthentic accounts might be considerably less *depending on* how many false positives there are from Cyabra. 
* The percentage of inauthentic accounts is not necessarily a reflection of your *chance* to engage with these accounts. Inauthentic accounts responding to a tweet might be buried at the bottom of a Twitter page, for instance. 

Ryan's video flashes through 45 tweets in this segment, all of which come from accounts tagged as inauthentic. (There’s actually 50 tweets, but one tweet is cut off at the bottom of each page.) These are sorted by “Max exposure”, which refers to the “*potential*” to reach that number of users; most people won’t notice this and will presume it corresponds with views. The actual views on the tweets are always significantly less than the figure given in the “Max exposure” column, and the views drop off quite quickly the further you go in the list — not that they were particularly high to begin with.  

Here are some of the entries on that list, where the first hyperlink for each bullet point links to the specific tweet flagged by Cyabra, as shown in the video:

* [Tech Guy](https://archive.li/rDROZ), who was really [upset](https://archive.li/KL1l2) about XQC’s defence of the ICE agent, and mentioned in [another tweet](https://archive.li/yoy1l) that “literally anyone Hasan or Destiny would cook him on this because he’s flat out wrong.” 
* A [BTS fan](https://archive.li/W4bXq) who tweeted four images, asking which one of them was Renee. (Various people were [misidentified](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c1lzvyjm3vet?post=asset%3A0c400ccb-387f-421e-860e-3b71499c44e5#post) as the victim.)  
* [Women Watch Afrika](https://archive.li/aVwaN), an NGO that linked to their [statement](https://womenwatchafrika.org/2026/women-watch-afrikas-statement-in-response-to-the-ice-killing-of-renee-nicole-good-in-minneapolis-minnesota/) in response to the killing. 
* [Lion David Greene](https://archive.li/bYbbu), a reverend with 45k followers on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/greenetx).
* [Forbes?!?!?!?!](https://archive.li/1eP0c)
* [Greg Levy](https://archive.li/DIsod), who is running for [Senate](https://ballotpedia.org/Gregory_Levy), and took part in [protests](https://archive.li/jxLbC).
* [Michael Kirwan](https://archive.li/ML3D7), who is running for [Congress](https://archive.li/GjV81). 
* [Marcus Thomas](https://archive.li/N9dcg), a 7D Energy Alchemist! 
* [Alexandria Rose](https://archive.li/rSHJj), a DSA Cleveland member linking to their substack post on Renee’s killing.

And so on. All of the above accounts have their accounts based in the US according to Twitter’s location feature, without any indicator of a VPN being used. They either make some neutral statement that Cyabra sometimes doesn't note, or they’re just genuinely agitated about the killing of Renee. 

There’s more Americans in the list if you’re willing to scroll through their tweets to get a beat on whether or not they’re real. [TheRedCreole](https://archive.li/181dg) posted their [results](https://archive.li/OmhDu) from one of those political compass variations. There’s [two](https://archive.li/sGwPG) [tweets](https://archive.li/QP4zP) by Fred Baliad in the list, someone who’s quite fond of retweeting the Krassenstein brothers. [This person](https://archive.li/JYeFt) was just sharing a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PArcU3Bt5Q) by Aaron Parnas. None of these people are *foreign adversaries*: sockpuppets, Russian/Chinese bots, etc.

Also in the list are a [Puerto Rican](https://archive.li/kJY3j) and an [Argentinian](https://archive.li/9ho1o) news outlet reporting on related news developments, and foreigners tweeting organically about the incident in their own language. [\[3\]](https://archive.li/TuZ3m) [\[4\]](https://archive.li/WsJOI) [\[5\]](https://archive.li/VAj4K) 

The first [tweet](https://archive.li/gUwDH) on the list is by Jvnior, who has appeared on [Modern-Day Debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xcv-yWgZvD0) before. 

There’s crypto slop, [\[6\]](https://archive.li/jUB0z) [\[7\]](https://archive.li/aujiO) and “news” AI slop [\[8\]](https://archive.li/0DnRu) [\[9\]](https://archive.li/Yx3P6) [\[10\]](https://archive.li/j0KcG) by bots. There’s also this weird, [schizo account](https://archive.li/dmBXL) as well. It’s all *slop*, but it doesn't fit the bill of something orchestrated by a foreign adversary looking to inflame tensions in the US. 

Are there any that could be foreign adversaries? Actual Russian bots or sockpuppets? Well, this is where it gets tricky. Ryan states:

>What's also interesting is that a lot of the authentic profiles have a negative connotation between President Trump and Rachel Nicole Good, whereas inauthentic profiles tend to have associations with ICE and Rachel Nicole Good. That tells me that foreign inauthentic actors are trying to spread anger about ICE, whereas authentic actors are users who are angry at the president directly. 

Ryan hasn't taken note of the fact that some of the accounts in the list were *defending* ICE, not attacking it — and are *possibly* real, MAGA Republicans. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: the MAGA movement is indistinguishable from any foreign adversary. 

This is something Destiny ran into when Twitter first started adding [location labels](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/x-user-location-feature-country-elon-musk-new-rcna245620). He had previously taken note of a bunch of different accounts regurgitating MAGA talking-points, and [he was curious](https://youtu.be/Yz3mK5lT2Lg?t=17535) if any of them were being operated from outside of the US. Apart from one British account, all of the location data for these accounts placed them inside the US, with only two that were using a VPN.  

A [tweet](https://archive.li/l5erf) by Bill Stotts is in the Cyabra list, who has a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wlstotts/) as well. It’s all generic, MAGA profiles, and he posts all the usual brainless points that you would expect. But the Twitter account is based in the US, and there seems to be authentic engagements from acquaintances of his on his Facebook. Bill appears to be a typical Trump sycophant who’s tweeting about a major domestic incident like everyone else in the US, but this account might be worth examining more closely.

Here’s [another one](https://archive.li/5NInm). Location based in the US, and they’re just a [racist](https://archive.li/AIo81), [transphobic](https://archive.li/vu55y) [moron](https://archive.li/iGqSS).

This is not what comes to mind when I think of foreign adversaries, outside of the fact that for some of them, their drivel leads to them being *functionally* the same. 

# The Highest Ranked Inauthentic Accounts:

At the end of the video, Ryan concludes:

>On this particular topic, using these five phrases, roughly 26% of the interactions were inauthentic. It means a quarter of the people that you likely interacted with don't exist or are Russian or Chinese bot farms trying to get you mad. 

Who’s in the 26%? Well, Ryan [shows us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_crFFBfnJo&t=36s) some of the top accounts ranked by “Max exposure.” (The top 10 are missing because he starts on page 2, for whatever reason.) If you look up the particular accounts whose names are unique enough to easily find, we run into the exact same problems as before with various entries.

**Americans:**

[BMB Empower Network](https://xcancel.com/BmbEmpower) are actual Americans. They have a [podcast](https://youtu.be/h5Qf8ZbxuHc?t=53), and their crime was [tweeting](https://archive.li/PpJld): “The #NewYorkTimes really nailed it by disproving the claims that #ReneeNicoleGood was attempting to use her car as a weapon. #IceAgent #Trump.” [Aezzi ](https://xcancel.com/AezzieUwU)the “Nordic Model Socdem” and… femboy appear to be American, and they’re just [arguing](https://archive.li/ltZUZ) vehemently against people on Twitter as normal.   

[Chris Hohnholz](https://www.instagram.com/p/DB88LvBp-Yz/) is another Republican who is [defending](https://archive.li/cqxmc) ICE. [Abbatoir blues](https://xcancel.com/faintghostglow) looks to be the rare Republican that [does not think](https://archive.li/teSvo) the shooting was justified.

**Incorrect Flags:**

Then there’s the accounts that, *as far as I can tell*, haven’t even tweeted about the incident. Even if we grant that they’re bots, they seem to have been erroneously flagged by Cyabra. [Echo of Colors](https://xcancel.com/EchoOfColors), an “AI artist” hasn’t said a word about the shooting. 

3RED is an account that [*only*](https://archive.li/x99Ad) seems to talk about “[Bigg Boss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigg_Boss_(Tamil_TV_series))”, the Tamil version of reality TV show Big Brother; likewise, [Evano Oruvan](https://xcancel.com/SViky99/), [just exist](https://xcancel.com/justexist55), and [Coorg2017](https://xcancel.com/Coorg2017) are obsessed with Bigg Boss. Assuming I haven’t made a mistake here, is it possible that the actual number of inauthentic accounts tweeting about the incident was much lower than the figure given by Cyabra?  

“[精霊使い - Writer + Dark Mother ☾](https://xcancel.com/NikholRei)”(NikholRei) is a [real person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqrLgPnvYok) who was incorrectly flagged. They mainly tweet about [spiritual mumbo-jumbo](https://archive.li/EVuoD):

>Men who have INTEGRATED THEIR MYSTICISM don't invoke spirits within a women that they can't reckon with. And IF they do this despite that fact, they are there to consume, feed off of and utilize that uncultivated chaos magick vested inside of women who have yet to master it.

[Preach it sister](https://archive.li/hnt0F). 🔥💅   

Keep in mind that as Ryan is flicking through the pages listing these accounts, he’s making the remark that he’s “tracking the disinformation spreading online.” I’m sure the audience for Bigg Boss are very passionate about this season and engage in many fiery debates, but it doesn’t look to be relevant to the subject matter of Ryan’s video.  

And I will not tolerate false accusations against the Dark Mother. 😡

**Imprecise Phrases:**

Take careful note of the following five phrases that Ryan plugged into Cyabra:

* Her car
* She was driving away
* Legal observer
* Renee Nicole Good
* Jonathan Ross

It *appears* to be the case that Cyabra has flagged tweets that use the five phrases verbatim even when they’re used in an entirely different context; and flagged tweets that used *parts* of the phrases. 

South African user “[Toxic and proud](https://xcancel.com/FeistyAdee)” (FeistyAdee) has not tweeted about the killing of Renee. So what was likely flagged by Cyabra? The [following](https://archive.li/6r9Pn):

>One thing for sure is nothing would've prevented that accident bcoz that fool was crazy in love and not thinking straight,,,like who kisses their woman while driving? Lmao blaming Thum won't change the facts. The only thing I blame her for is giving the brat **her car** \#InimbaMzansi

[Inimba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inimba?useskin=vector) is a South African TV series. This seemed to be quite the thrilling episode as FeistyAdee is fervidly [tweeting](https://archive.li/WLtEM) [about](https://archive.li/21rIW) it [across](https://archive.li/4mPNZ) [several](https://archive.li/DGQnW) [tweets](https://archive.li/GOPp1), some of which mention “her car” and “driving.” Regardless of whether or not this user is authentic, this is a case of an irrelevant tweet being drawn into the dataset. Is it possible that there’s even more users in the list that were discussing Inimba?  

Here’s another South African account, according to the location feature: “[WosoSA 🏆 🏆Champions of Europe.](https://xcancel.com/sa_woso86096?lang=en)” What was inadvertently [flagged](https://archive.li/i1Teh):

>Compared to Jonas **Renèe** is good at profiling players that will fit to her system i don't know why her ass doesn't want to be a manager it will nake her job even easier, Jonas used to buy and inshallah which then led to a lot of squad turnovers.  

[Renee Slegers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9e_Slegers?useskin=vector) is the head coach of Women's Super League club Arsenal. You will find many tweets by this user talking about Renee Slegers if you search for “Renee”, including five made on the day of the killing. Two of these look to have been flagged by Cyabra as indicated in Ryan’s video, unless the day intervals used included the day before the killing. Note that WosoSA ranks 12 on the list with a “Max exposure” of 366k.

**Positive Sentiment:**

[MishyMoo](https://xcancel.com/MichelleMurph82/with_replies), based in Ireland according to the location data, made one [tweet](https://archive.li/M3Ngq) in response to a clip of Renee’s wife crying: “I wish someone would comfort her when she broke down 😣 but maybe they did and it wasn’t shown.” Cyabra gets this right and marks the tweet as “positive”, but it would be interesting to know how many of these supposedly inauthentic accounts made similar, positive tweets, or tweets that should have been positive.

“[CRAYONKAT](https://xcancel.com/crayolageni)” is some [meme](https://archive.li/J251j)/parody account that really likes [drawing](https://archive.li/pkuib) with crayons. Whatever makes them happy. This is another account with a flagged tweet marked positive — but in this case, it’s also an incorrect flag as they’ve said nothing about the incident. 

**Irrelevancy:**

There are a couple important questions to think about:

* What is the percentage of inauthentic accounts that are *relevant?* 
* What percentage of relevant accounts can reasonably be considered a foreign adversary because of how they’re attempting to engineer and amplify outrage? 
* What has been the actual impact of foreign adversaries on the information space surrounding the killing of Renee Nicole Good?
* Are these foreign adversaries more likely to mimic the left-wing or right-wing narrative on this incident?

I have no doubt in my mind that the further along we get in the list of inauthentic accounts, the likelihood of encountering some foreign adversary becomes higher — but simultaneously, for this particular incident, the engagement looks to also drop off quite sharply. I am not too fond of how Ryan’s video insinuates that foreign adversaries are mimicking “both sides” of the partisan divide on this incident, overemphasising their contribution to the left-wing narrative. He might be able to make a more persuasive case, but then I return to what I said about the process mattering.  

Final point: it’s entirely possible I myself have misidentified the accounts or tweets that Cyabra flagged — in fact, it is *likely* — and I will happily make corrections if someone points them out. It’s unfortunate that Ryan's video cuts off the account name for the tweets themselves as it would have made it easier to find. It’s also unfortunate that when I asked him twice if he was aware of the false positives, he avoided it the first time and ignored it the second. 

Maybe that Forbes article was actually shared by a different, inauthentic account, and the tweet was later deleted. This is information only Ryan can confirm as I’m sure he still has the project saved. That being said, I’m doubtful that any errors made on my part are substantial enough that the main criticisms made in this post are invalidated.  

# The “Legal Observer” Conspiracy

In [this segment](https://youtu.be/x_crFFBfnJo?t=299), Ryan gets… conspiratorial? *Maybe*. The statements here make heavy implications. Ryan noted that various political figures and viral tweets were using the phrase “legal observer” when referring to Renee. He claimed it was ""part of a script"" and that ""some sort of talking points \[were\] sent out"" to use the phrase. In his article, he writes that “something coordinated was happening” due to the “sudden, synchronized appearance of the phrase.”  

This is similar to what [Libs of TikTok tweeted](https://archive.li/zQky3), who said that the “narrative went out” and that someone was writing “identical talking points for the Democrats”, providing various screenshots of tweets mentioning the phrase. 

I made a post in his subreddit asking u/Ryanmcbeth various questions about his video in an attempt to get some clarity, including his remarks on the phrase. Unfortunately, he ignored most of it, and just chose to make a joke about one of the questions asked. Fair enough, he is of course under no obligation to answer, and I can appreciate that he gets swarmed with emails; but it does mean that I can’t present a more clearly defined position of his. (I will also note that it does bother him when people don’t answer [*his* questions.](https://youtu.be/vf4BJZW9pY4?t=305)) 

What’s missing from the observations made by Libs of TikTok and Ryan is any research into where the term originated from. Weeks before the killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis, Minnesota, organizations like the [Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee](https://www.startribune.com/amid-surging-ice-raids-twin-cities-protesters-and-observers-mobilize-to-film-arrests/601548131) were already training people as “legal observers” to ICE operations. 

When Renee was killed, early accounts from local reporters and city council members who spoke to witnesses of the crime claimed that she was an observer. For example, a reporter from KARE 11, a local television station, [stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09mEvEK24uQ&t=309s):

>Yeah, a few witnesses have told me that they believe it was an observer that was here for the incident, and that was the person who was shot. We have heard from other witnesses, however, that claim it was someone who was potentially a target of a warrant that was potentially running away is what, you know, NBC might be reporting. So that's what we're trying to figure out, if it, you know, was someone who was here observing, or if it was someone who was actually the target of it.

A [Minneapolis photojournalist](https://bsky.app/profile/chaddavis.photography/post/3mbtvrzdij22b) said they were told by the community that an “ICE officer shot an observer”, but they couldn’t confirm it; [Minneapolis council member](https://archive.li/N7cQt) Robin Wensley [said](https://archive.li/e2E1c) they were at the scene of the crime, and that residents “witnessed federal agents shoot an observer”; and Minnesota Public Radio reporter [Jon Collins](https://bsky.app/profile/jcollins.bsky.social/post/3mbtwi64mfs2f) said he was told by witnesses that ICE shot an observer.

Therefore, when Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar made one of the first [tweets](https://archive.li/jnx2z) that went viral using the phrase, she was likely referring to what was simply conveyed to her from folk following the local reports. The term quickly spread from viral tweet to viral tweet as any notable information tends to do for these breaking news, major events. There was no “script” or “coordination” taking place here.  

# AI-generated Images and Tweets

This section isn’t particularly important compared to the main criticisms made.

The first is the AI-generated image made by a user on Twitter. I abhor anyone providing any sort of defense for the ICE agent, but Ryan says the image was “likely created with the intent of tricking people into believing it was real.” This is a very minor point, but I don’t know how Ryan missed that literally two minutes after the user posted the AI image they [tweeted](https://xcancel.com/ScummyMummy511/status/2009029209935802481) that it was AI-generated. It's from a ""[simulation](http://xcancel.com/ScummyMummy511/status/2009013353923137657)"" they made. Regardless, I mention that only because this along with the next point seems emblematic of how little scrutiny Ryan gives to these accounts.  

In Ryan’s video, it is shown that Cyabra marks various tweets as “Likely AI generated.” Cyabra themselves are acknowledging that the software could make mistakes. Ryan highlights that a [tweet](https://archive.li/eV7NA) by afropessimistic, which received the most engagement for a particular phrase, was likely AI generated even though the user was authentic. 

A cursory search through their tweets quickly reveals them to be a very abrasive progressive, but I don’t see a reason why they would need *AI* to generate that simple tweet for them. The problem with Ryan highlighting this tweet and taking Cyabra at face value is that it could lead to misconceptions amongst his audience on how many high-engagement tweets angry about the killing are actually AI generated. 

# Final Thoughts

Is Cyabra a bad tool? Absolutely not — but one should be careful about the conclusions drawn by plugging in a couple phrases; careful scrutiny is needed. In Ryan’s bid to be apolitical (which I would argue he’s inconsistent on when he’s [regurgitating nonsense](https://archive.li/nt9CV) from Sebastian Gorka), he’s chosen not to give his moral evaluation on the circumstances surrounding the killing of Renee Good, and has instead focused on how foreign adversaries are weaponizing the incident. 

Personally, I would argue that whatever impact they may have had pales in comparison to the misinformation and abhorrence Republicans are propagating themselves. If Ryan wants to claim that there is a significant problem with foreign adversaries mimicking the left-wing narrative on the killing of Renee Good, a more compelling case should have been presented. If Ryan factored in all the relevant points made in this post, what adjustments could have been made on his conclusions?",194,1768498077.0,Destiny,15,1.0,False

**The Foster Child**

**11/26/87**

3:52 PM

Caroline had nothing left to say about that night. Not to the police. Not to anyone. So, she

pretended to sleep while the unfamiliar voices muffled through the floorboards,

bleeding from the kitchen below. Sandra was entertaining them, of course. She

was very good at it. Always quick to slap on a smile for a house guest, no

matter how grim the occasion.  She’d likely set the table, brew some

coffee. And today, it seemed, she’d baked cookies. Caroline could smell them.

Typically, this would have been enough to lift her out of bed and down the stairs, but not

today. She had no intention of walking into the hornet’s nest. How long would

it take before they gave up and left? By dinner? She’d be happy to eat whatever

combination of canned vegetables Sandra concocted as long as she didn’t have to

answer any more questions.

Caroline had already talked to the Waycross Police three times in the past week. Once at the

hospital the morning after the abductions, again a day later in the police

chief’s office, and then during a house visit two days ago to follow up on some

‘inconsistencies.’ The detective was careful to soften his tone while poking

holes in her story. He told her it was understandable to misremember some key

details after surviving a traumatic ordeal, even going so far as apologizing

for not quoting her accurately. Like it was *his* fault. It was Caroline’s fault. She had lied

through her teeth.

She made mistakes that a seasoned criminal might find laughable, like not committing

tiny details of her story to memory or inventing most of her bullshit on the

fly while the adrenaline from the night was still pumping. After the

questioning at the police station a day later, Caroline knew she had failed her

follow-up exam. Now, the chickens had come home to roost. Whatever the hell

that meant.

Caroline could imagine the scene playing downstairs. A couple of cops with ties, maybe a

uniformed sheriff, sitting around the kitchen table sipping coffee and nibbling

on Tollhouse. They were probably wondering at what point they could bypass

Donna Reed and march straight up to the girl’s room. This round of questioning

would be an interrogation.

*Knock Knock—* The bedroom door swung in, letting the hallway light spill across her sheets.

“Caroline, honey, I need you to wake up and talk to these men,” Sandra said, stepping

inside. Her hair was pinned up, and worry lines stood out on her forehead. She

used that tone of voice reserved for when others could hear. It was gentle and

kind. She never really talked like that, and Caroline hated the act.

The two men followed Sandra into the bedroom. One tall, the other stocky. Both had kind

smiles. Caroline shifted upright, pulling her knees close to her chest. The

energy shift was unexpected. If they were police, Caroline would have known it

immediately. In the past week, she’d become intimately familiar with the

tension that radiated off cops like bad B.O. She usually associated a police

presence with a harsh red aura. But as she looked at these two strangers, she

felt only a calming shade of pastel blue. It was like a mild glow that hovered

around them. Non-threatening.

“Hello, Caroline,” the taller man said. “I’m Dr. Harold Sullen, and this is Mr. Goffagon, my assistant.”

Mr. Goffagon nodded. Dr. Sullen sat on the foot of the bed, forcing Caroline to scoot

sideways. “We’re very excited to meet you.”

*Doctor? Did Sandra call someone to have my head examined?* It wouldn’t be the

first time a foster parent deemed her defective. Sandra’s house was her third

in four years, and she was suspecting her act was running thin here as well.

“We read about you in the newspaper. You’re quite an extraordinary young woman. We

explained to your mother downstairs that I’m a doctor, not the kind that cures

the body, but one that helps the mind.”

Caroline had never once called Sandra ‘mother.’

“What’s wrong with my mind?” Caroline asked.

“Absolutely nothing. The opposite. We think there’s a chance, based on what your mother has

told us, that your mind has a unique way of operating. The way you think and

how you see the world.”

If Sandra wanted to get rid of her for good, this was the playbook—first, the doctors,

then the diagnosis, and then the facility.

“You’re skeptical. And that’s okay,” Dr. Sullen said. “I’m going to ask you some

questions. I’d love to learn more about you.”

“About the night of the…?” Sandra cut in.

“No, nothing like that. Not yet anyway. You can sit next to Caroline if it makes her more

comfortable.” Dr. Sullen motioned to the bed, but Sandra ignored it.

Caroline didn’t want her sitting on the bed or standing in her room. They had well

established that in their time together.

“How old are you?” Dr. Sullen smiled.

“Fifteen.”

“How long have you lived here with your new mother?” Dr. Sullen lifted his brow in

anticipation of Caroline’s answer.

“Eight and a half months,” Sandra blurted.

“Mrs. Hammerlock, please let Caroline answer.” He softened his eyes toward Caroline

like she was a flower that could wilt at any moment.

“Eight months,” Caroline confirmed.

“Does your birth mother know your whereabouts?”

“I don’t know.”

“She doesn’t, and that’s by court order,” Sandra buzzed.

“Thank you very much, Mrs. Hammerlock,” Dr. Sullen smiled. “This might work better

one-on-one. Do you mind waiting outside? Kindly exit the room.”

A quiet tension hung in the air as Sandra considered. 

“It’s fine,” Caroline said.

“I’ll be downstairs. If you need me.” She scurried out, and the door clicked behind her.

In that moment, Dr. Sullen rose to mythic status. Caroline had been trying to get that

woman out of her room for eight months. Sometimes kicking and screaming, other

times pretending to be sick or sleeping. It wasn’t that she hated Sandra.

Caroline had no interest in the mommy daughter routine. Her school outfits were

preplanned. Always a dress, and always hanging from the doorknob of the closet

in the morning. Sandra seemed to enjoy dressing her up like a doll and parading

her around a social network of miserable homebodies. PTA moms who’d chain-smoke

and sip mimosas.

Dr. Sullen waited for Sandra’s footsteps to fade before speaking again.

“That’s much better, isn’t it? You don’t care for Mrs. Hammerlock, do you?”

Caroline’s silence seemed enough of an answer.

“It’s not her fault, you know. Mrs. Hammerlock can’t begin to grasp the weight you carry.

She’s never felt what it’s like to be uprooted, torn from a mother you barely

remember, and handed off to strangers who don’t understand you.  She lives

in her tidy world, where everything is neat, manageable…predictable.”

“But you… you’ve seen the cracks. You’ve fallen through them. You’ve lived in the spaces

people pretend not to look. You see the world as it really is, cruel and

unfiltered. You see everything. You always have.” Dr. Sullen leaned in when he

spoke, and Caroline found herself falling into his piercing eyes. She quickly

snapped out of it.

*It’s bullshit.*

*He doesn’t know anything about me.*

“You’d be surprised what I know about you,” Dr. Sullen responded and Caroline lost her

breath. Had she spoken that last thought aloud? The walls of her bedroom

suddenly felt too close. 

*”You have a real mother, Caroline.”*

He said it with a deathly serious tone that scared her at first. But did he say it at all?

She wasn’t sure whether his mouth moved. If he had caught her during any other

week in her life, she would have dismissed it outright. But, after the night of

the party at Jenny’s house, Caroline was willing to entertain anything. Dr.

Sullen held serve, never breaking eyes for the length of their uncomfortable

silence. As his colors grew warmer and his face reverted to a polite smile,

Caroline’s fear evaporated.

“You’ve recently experienced a traumatic event. The death of two girls from your

school. You haven’t spoken to anyone about what happened the night of the

party, have you?” 

Caroline swallowed hard. “The police.”

“I mean the truth.”

“No.”

“Good girl. Most people don’t have time for things that don’t fit into their convenient

little boxes. But some people do. Like myself and Mr. Goffagon here,” Dr.

Sullen waved to his partner, who nodded. “You can talk to us about what you

saw—or *who* you saw that night. We’re not here to judge—only to help you

understand. To make sense of what others can’t. At Jenny’s house, did you have

an uninvited guest?”

“How—?”

“I know things, Caroline. You’d be surprised—the things I know.”

“I can’t,” she whispered, blinking back tears.

“Nothing you say will leave this room. I know how to keep secrets.”

Caroline crossed her arms and leaned back against the headboard.

“Did someone threaten you?” Dr. Sullen asked.

“No. It’s just… I know how this goes, and I won’t check into another hospital.”

Dr. Sullen‘s expression softened.

“A mental hospital? For telling the truth? Why? Because they’d twist your words and call

them delusions? That’s what they do. They lock away what scares them. Tell me,

Caroline, what would scare them so much?”

Her chest tightened and she searched the ceiling. Not for an answer, but for the courage

to lift the weight around her neck. When she spoke, her voice was barely audible.

“Can you open my closet door first?”

His eyebrows lifted. “The closet? Why?”

“That’s the last place I saw her.”

Dr. Sullen studied her for a moment, then motioned to Goffagon.

“You saw someone in the closet?” Dr. Sullen pointed.

Caroline’s nails dug into the blanket. “I see her face everywhere. In my laundry pile, in

the closet, when I close my eyes. I know it’s ridiculous, but sometimes I feel

like she’s watching me. That she’s been in my bedroom. Like I can still smell

her.” Caroline’s voice shook and her cheeks reddened.

“She…?”

“She wears a veil to cover her face. To hide her scars.”

Goffagon swung open the closet door and yanked the string light. The bulb flickered, then steadied, washing over a row of hanging dresses.

Caroline exhaled.

“See? You’re safe,” Dr. Sullen assured, picking up her hand. “There’s no one here but you,

me, and Mr. Goffagon.” Dr. Sullen leaned in, folding his hands over the edge of

her blanket. Mr. Goffagon took a small step closer, as if to block the doorway.

“It’s time to talk about it, Caroline. We’ll start from the beginning,” Dr. Sullen said.

“It’ll be our secret.”",1,1768498064.0,BetaReaders,1,1.0,False

I’ll remember how your eyes would sparkle like Christmas lights, soft with the remnants of dreams.

In spring, I will always think of you when the first gentle breeze stirs the leaves along the path we used to walk, you know, the one near the place we once called home.

In summer, I will always think of you and that picnic in the park, sprawled on a blanket, warming ourselves in the sun, trading our favourite songs. I know you sometimes thought I didn't listen to the songs you showed me, but I cherished every one of them, even though I didn't know how to show it. 

In autumn, I will always think of you when the light threads through the trees and turns the browning leaves to gold. You always said your brown eyes weren’t anything special, but to me they were the very colour of autumn. Deep and warm and when the light caught them just right, touched with a quiet, golden shine.

I think I will think of you always, wherever I am in the world, with every sunrise, every sunset, every night the moon illuminates the balcony of our old apartment. And when I look up, I’ll be glad to know that even if we aren’t together, we are still looking at the same sky.

And I hope, I hope, if only for a fleeting moment, when you look at that first twinkling star in the sky, you’ll think of me, too.

1qdpkkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamingFrench/comments/1qdpkkw/is_immersionco_beating_dreaming_french_at_their/,Is immersion.co beating Dreaming French at their own game?,"I love Dreaming Spanish and their team, but 10 days into my French-learning journey, I find that I'm using the Dreaming French platform much less than I'd expected. After trying both, I ended up subscribing to [immersion.co](http://immersion.co) rather than DF. It offers a very similar product, in fact it copies most of the basic design of DF/DS. But at least from what I've seen as a super-beginner, Immersion is just... better in almost every way. DF certainly has some serious competition here.

**Content**: This may change over time, but right now in January 2026 Dreaming French has 33 Super Beginner videos with an average length around 5-6 minutes, while Immersion has 90 Rookie videos with an average length 10-15 minutes. That's like 5x more hours of total content at this level. DF has four guides versus only one at Immersion, but Immersion is still adding new daily content at a similar or even faster rate.

**Format/Style**: This will come down to personal taste, but I just prefer the Immersion videos. They are more like older Pablo videos on the Dreaming Spanish platform, and include a lot of repetition and rephrasing ideas in different ways, small pauses for emphasis, little drawings and diagrams, etc. It feels like the host Morgane is really making an effort to reach you. The whole video is generally one long take from one fixed camera angle.

Something about the DF videos just feels a little over-produced to me, sometimes I feel like I'm watching a YouTube influencer channel, they feel more focused on presentation style over substance. For example in DF's ""Coffee or Tea?"" Super-Beginner video, there are 35 seconds of exposition of Chloé putting on her slippers and walking around her home from various camera angles before she ever says her first words. And In general I feel that DF relies almost exclusively on speaking slowly plus tons of image pop-ups in order to make videos comprehensible, whereas Immersion (and older Pablo videos) use an altogether different speaking style that anticipates which phrases are likely to be new to the listener. To me it feels more like a real conversation.

**Extras**: For roughly the same price as DF, Immersion also offers some interesting extra features that DF lacks. To be fair, I haven't tried any of these yet and can't say anything about their quality. But it includes Read/Listen content where you read the text of a short story while simultaneously listening to audio narration, as well as an AI Crosstalk feature, and an option for 1:1 human tutoring (extra cost). You can get all of these separately elsewhere, but it's kind of nice to see them bundled and integrated into the progress tracking.

In conclusion, I don't want to sound like a Dreaming French hater and I really want to see the Dreaming team successful. I hope they're looking at Immersion and other resources that are emerging in order to spur new development and ideas in their own platform. I'm in this sub because I come from Dreaming Spanish and I want to see Dreaming French succeed in the same way. At the end of the day, these services aren't very expensive and a language learner could subscribe to multiple services to get the best of all worlds. I just hope DF doesn't get complacent due to their past success with DS, while new competition pops up that matches or surpasses them. ",9,1768497563.0,DreamingFrench,3,0.8,False

**The Foster Child**

**11/26/87**

3:52 PM

Caroline had nothing left to say about that night. Not to the police. Not to anyone. So, she

pretended to sleep while the unfamiliar voices muffled through the floorboards,

bleeding from the kitchen below. Sandra was entertaining them, of course. She

was very good at it. Always quick to slap on a smile for a house guest, no

matter how grim the occasion.  She’d likely set the table, brew some

coffee. And today, it seemed, she’d baked cookies. Caroline could smell them.

Typically, this would have been enough to lift her out of bed and down the stairs, but not

today. She had no intention of walking into the hornet’s nest. How long would

it take before they gave up and left? By dinner? She’d be happy to eat whatever

combination of canned vegetables Sandra concocted as long as she didn’t have to

answer any more questions.

Caroline had already talked to the Waycross Police three times in the past week. Once at the

hospital the morning after the abductions, again a day later in the police

chief’s office, and then during a house visit two days ago to follow up on some

‘inconsistencies.’ The detective was careful to soften his tone while poking

holes in her story. He told her it was understandable to misremember some key

details after surviving a traumatic ordeal, even going so far as apologizing

for not quoting her accurately. Like it was *his* fault. It was Caroline’s fault. She had lied

through her teeth.

She made mistakes that a seasoned criminal might find laughable, like not committing

tiny details of her story to memory or inventing most of her bullshit on the

fly while the adrenaline from the night was still pumping. After the

questioning at the police station a day later, Caroline knew she had failed her

follow-up exam. Now, the chickens had come home to roost. Whatever the hell

that meant.

Caroline could imagine the scene playing downstairs. A couple of cops with ties, maybe a

uniformed sheriff, sitting around the kitchen table sipping coffee and nibbling

on Tollhouse. They were probably wondering at what point they could bypass

Donna Reed and march straight up to the girl’s room. This round of questioning

would be an interrogation.

*Knock Knock—* The bedroom door swung in, letting the hallway light spill across her sheets.

“Caroline, honey, I need you to wake up and talk to these men,” Sandra said, stepping

inside. Her hair was pinned up, and worry lines stood out on her forehead. She

used that tone of voice reserved for when others could hear. It was gentle and

kind. She never really talked like that, and Caroline hated the act.

The two men followed Sandra into the bedroom. One tall, the other stocky. Both had kind

smiles. Caroline shifted upright, pulling her knees close to her chest**.** The

energy shift was unexpected. If they were police, Caroline would have known it

immediately. In the past week, she’d become intimately familiar with the

tension that radiated off cops like bad B.O. She usually associated a police

presence with a harsh red aura. But as she looked at these two strangers, she

felt only a calming shade of pastel blue. It was like a mild glow that hovered

around them. Non-threatening.

“Hello,

Caroline,” the taller man said. “I’m Dr. Harold Sullen, and this is Mr. Goffagon, my assistant.”

Mr. Goffagon nodded. Dr. Sullen sat on the foot of the bed, forcing Caroline to scoot

sideways. “We’re very excited to meet you.”

*Doctor? Did Sandra call someone to have my head examined?* It wouldn’t be the

first time a foster parent deemed her defective. Sandra’s house was her third

in four years, and she was suspecting her act was running thin here as well.

“We read about you in the newspaper. You’re quite an extraordinary young woman. We

explained to your mother downstairs that I’m a doctor, not the kind that cures

the body, but one that helps the mind.”

Caroline had never once called Sandra ‘mother.’

“What’s wrong with my mind?” Caroline asked.

“Absolutely nothing. The opposite. We think there’s a chance, based on what your mother has

told us, that your mind has a unique way of operating. The way you think and

how you see the world.”

If Sandra wanted to get rid of her for good, this was the playbook—first, the doctors,

then the diagnosis, and then the facility.

“You’re skeptical. And that’s okay,” Dr. Sullen said. “I’m going to ask you some

questions. I’d love to learn more about you.”

“About the night of the…?” Sandra cut in.

“No, nothing like that. Not yet anyway. You can sit next to Caroline if it makes her more

comfortable.” Dr. Sullen motioned to the bed, but Sandra ignored it.

Caroline didn’t want her sitting on the bed or standing in her room. They had well

established that in their time together.

“How old are you?” Dr. Sullen smiled.

“Fifteen.”

“How long have you lived here with your new mother?” Dr. Sullen lifted his brow in

anticipation of Caroline’s answer.

“Eight and a half months,” Sandra blurted.

“Mrs. Hammerlock, please let Caroline answer.” He softened his eyes toward Caroline

like she was a flower that could wilt at any moment.

“Eight months,” Caroline confirmed.

“Does your birth mother know your whereabouts?”

“I don’t know.”

“She doesn’t, and that’s by court order,” Sandra buzzed.

“Thank you very much, Mrs. Hammerlock,” Dr. Sullen smiled. “This might work better

one-on-one. Do you mind waiting outside? Kindly exit the room.”

A quiet tension hung in the air as Sandra considered. 

“It’s fine,” Caroline said.

“I’ll be downstairs. If you need me.” She scurried out, and the door clicked behind her.

In that moment, Dr. Sullen rose to mythic status. Caroline had been trying to get that

woman out of her room for eight months. Sometimes kicking and screaming, other

times pretending to be sick or sleeping. It wasn’t that she hated Sandra.

Caroline had no interest in the mommy daughter routine. Her school outfits were

preplanned. Always a dress, and always hanging from the doorknob of the closet

in the morning. Sandra seemed to enjoy dressing her up like a doll and parading

her around a social network of miserable homebodies. PTA moms who’d chain-smoke

and sip mimosas.

Dr. Sullen waited for Sandra’s footsteps to fade before speaking again.

“That’s much better, isn’t it? You don’t care for Mrs. Hammerlock, do you?”

Caroline’s silence seemed enough of an answer.

“It’s not her fault, you know. Mrs. Hammerlock can’t begin to grasp the weight you carry.

She’s never felt what it’s like to be uprooted, torn from a mother you barely

remember, and handed off to strangers who don’t understand you.  She lives

in her tidy world, where everything is neat, manageable…predictable.”

“But you… you’ve seen the cracks. You’ve fallen through them. You’ve lived in the spaces

people pretend not to look. You see the world as it really is, cruel and

unfiltered. You see everything. You always have.” Dr. Sullen leaned in when he

spoke, and Caroline found herself falling into his piercing eyes. She quickly

snapped out of it.

*It’s bullshit.*

*He doesn’t know anything about me.*

“You’d be surprised what I know about you,” Dr. Sullen responded and Caroline lost her

breath. Had she spoken that last thought aloud? The walls of her bedroom

suddenly felt too close. 

*”You have a real mother, Caroline.”*

He said it with a deathly serious tone that scared her at first. But did he say it at all?

She wasn’t sure whether his mouth moved. If he had caught her during any other

week in her life, she would have dismissed it outright. But, after the night of

the party at Jenny’s house, Caroline was willing to entertain anything. Dr.

Sullen held serve, never breaking eyes for the length of their uncomfortable

silence. As his colors grew warmer and his face reverted to a polite smile,

Caroline’s fear evaporated.

“You’ve recently experienced a traumatic event. The death of two girls from your

school. You haven’t spoken to anyone about what happened the night of the

party, have you?” 

Caroline swallowed hard. “The police.”

“I mean the truth.”

“No.”

“Good girl. Most people don’t have time for things that don’t fit into their convenient

little boxes. But some people do. Like myself and Mr. Goffagon here,” Dr.

Sullen waved to his partner, who nodded. “You can talk to us about what you

saw—or *who* you saw that night. We’re not here to judge—only to help you

understand. To make sense of what others can’t. At Jenny’s house, did you have

an uninvited guest?”

“How—?”

“I know things, Caroline. You’d be surprised—the things I know.”

“I can’t,” she whispered, blinking back tears.

“Nothing you say will leave this room. I know how to keep secrets.”

Caroline crossed her arms and leaned back against the headboard.

“Did someone threaten you?” Dr. Sullen asked.

“No. It’s just… I know how this goes, and I won’t check into another hospital.”

Dr. Sullen‘s expression softened.

“A mental hospital? For telling the truth? Why? Because they’d twist your words and call

them delusions? That’s what they do. They lock away what scares them. Tell me,

Caroline, what would scare them so much?”

Her chest tightened and she searched the ceiling. Not for an answer, but for the courage

to lift the weight around her neck. When she spoke, her voice was barely audible.

“Can you open my closet door first?”

His eyebrows lifted. “The closet? Why?”

“That’s the last place I saw her.”

Dr. Sullen studied her for a moment, then motioned to Goffagon.

“You saw someone in the closet?” Dr. Sullen pointed.

Caroline’s nails dug into the blanket. “I see her face everywhere. In my laundry pile, in

the closet, when I close my eyes. I know it’s ridiculous, but sometimes I feel

like she’s watching me. That she’s been in my bedroom. Like I can still smell

her.” Caroline’s voice shook and her cheeks reddened.

“She…?”

“She wears a veil to cover her face. To hide her scars.”

Goffagon swung open the closet door and yanked the string light. The bulb flickered, then steadied, washing over a row of hanging dresses.

Caroline exhaled.

“See? You’re safe,” Dr. Sullen assured, picking up her hand. “There’s no one here but you,

me, and Mr. Goffagon.” Dr. Sullen leaned in, folding his hands over the edge of

her blanket. Mr. Goffagon took a small step closer, as if to block the doorway.

“It’s time to talk about it, Caroline. We’ll start from the beginning,” Dr. Sullen said.

“It’ll be our secret.”

I am 32M, recently met someone online. We are going on a date over the weekend and I wanted recommendations near or in Indiranagar. We are first going for a coffee making workshop near HAL which ends by 1pm and then I figured, I should take her somewhere for lunch. 

I live in Electronic City and have no idea about good cafes/restaurants in the Indiranagar area. I did check on Dineout, but nothing really clicked, everything seemed too cramped for space. Ideally want something quiet so we can hear each other talk and with good ambience. Also want to avoid breweries or pubs since she doesn't drink.

Additionally, does Indiranagar have walkable roads or a place you can just leisurely walk and talk without the risk of a Thar imprinting its tyre on your face? I was considering going to Ulsoor lake post lunch if everything goes too well but it's a drive again which I want to avoid, considering we already will be driving from HAL.

I been vegan for 2 years, vegetarian for over 15 years before that.    
At first when I went vegan it really improved my health. But then I just started getting hungry all the time and feeling really sick. I can't go 3 hours without eating or I just feel terrible.   
I can cook myself a really healthy lentil/bean chilli with rice (like 2 person portion) and still be feeling terrible 3 hours later. I could eat that 3-4 times a day and still feel hungry.   
I've tried all of the different pieces of advice from other vegans; more protein, more healthy carbs, no processed carbs, less carbs more veg.   
  
Docs have done tests. I am overall healthy (I eat a TON of Nutritional Yeast with b12). The only thing lacking is Iron, which is a shock as I do take Iron tabs with Vitamin C/Orange juice and not with tea/coffee.   
I have been spending so much money and taking so many supplements everyday, probably just paying for expensive pee. 

I have gained SO much weight that I am overweight but I'm just constantly hungry and constantly thinking about food. So much so that I feel like I'm spending more time thinking about food than anything else. It distracts me from everyday tasks.   
  
About a week ago I caved and went back to vegetarianism to trial it. Ate an egg at work and had milk in my coffee instead of soy/oat. I wasn't hungry at all for most of the day.   
Since then I have just been trailing a vegetarian diet again and I do feel that I feel so much fuller, less sleepy and more energetic since. I've gone from having 3-4 heavy meals/snack sessions a day or snacking all day-everyday to having 1-2 full meals and a snack in the evening.    


I just don't know how to get past the ethical part. I went to College for animal degree, part of that was to study animal agriculture (not my main area), so I know how the whole farming process and slaughter house process works. So I haven't been influenced by any of the propaganda or fake info a lot of vegans share. And I have a lot of knowledge of animal behaviour.   
So for me it's making it really really hard. - Just wondering how other people came to terms with it.   
Talking with the vegan community on Reddit is a great way to turn me away from the vegan community though. haha. ",7,1768497282.0,exvegans,6,1.0,False

So here is the first impressions : 

  
CHERRYISH 🍒 : Start off literally pure like cherry on top of a blackforest cake, sweet, syruppy and dries down into chocolate covered cherry scents like a black forest cake! OMG i love this so much my fave out of the bunch and prob would be my second all time lush fave scents 😍

  
STRABERRY FEELS FOREVER 🍓 : Right of the bat it is an ""airy / breezy"" Strawberry if that makes scents like air freshener in a perfumey way, and then the lactonic which is i percieved like a glass of milk rather than cream followed. It's more like a strawberry milk rather than strawberry and whipped cream/cream. It's not quite what i expected tbh i expect the strawberry would be candyish or fruitier and it's cream not milk (i quite don't like the milk notes in here too photorealistic like pure milk), but it is still good i like it enough to wear it often maybe would grow to love 🤔

  
PUMPKIN SPICE 🎃 : Opens up with spices from the pantry LOL i hate this too (I detect cloves and idk more), i knew this would be off putting for most people but WAIT because it last only like 3-5 mins and the drydown is completely different scents! I am shocked because i quite like the drydown it's like Dirty Dark Roasted Black Coffee with lil chocolate, lil dirt / earthy pumpkin maybe(??), and lil spice and it is quite unique and the surprising factor adds the points so much for me. Dare i say it is not that bad as the mixed review and it is very wearable and yes it doesn't smells like chicken soup / stock / ramen for me but i appreciate all different noses! 🙀

What now?","I’ve been talking to a lot of older friends with kids in their early twenties who have just graduated and both the parents and kids are low-level freaking out about the job market. Here’s what I’d do if I’d just graduated.

Before I started applying for jobs, I’d have a look at the market as a whole and try and pick industries that seem likely to grow, not decline in the next decade. LinkedIn recently released [this list](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-jobs-rise-2026-25-fastest-growing-roles-us-linkedin-news-dlb1c/) about jobs that are growing in the US - I’d take it with a pinch of salt since it seems to ignore non-white collar jobs, but it’s certainly worth a look. Given it’s the beginning of the year, there also seems to be a bunch of specialists making their predictions on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/ZHqHNbyXBbc). Make a list of industries which both look healthy and which you’d be interested in working in.

It’s 2026, so your online presence counts for as much as your offline. Delete any embarrassing pictures/material that come up when you search for your name online. Make sure your LinkedIn profile looks as professional as possible and if you can, get LinkedIn testimonials from anyone you’ve done internships during college for or your professors. 

Given how reluctant people are to hire graduates at the moment, I’d want to stand out. Once you’ve decided what job you’re going for, create something of your own so you’re not just another name on a resume. If you want to be a journalist, start your own online magazine or blog; if you want to be a software engineer, create your own task manager app or mock up an e-commerce mini-site. 

If you’re financially able to live off an internship, I’d do one in the career I was aiming for and I’d go for as many coffees with people while I was there. It feels embarrassing, but never fails - at the end of each coffee, ask “Is there anyone else you think it might be useful for me to talk to?” and ideally they’d refer you to someone in the same industry, but in a different company. If you can’t do the internship, do the same idea but you’ll need to warm up the first person you approach a little more (find someone whose work you admire and explain that you’re hoping to one day have the same job they have, and you’d be particularly interested in speaking to them because you love this project they’ve done - make reference to their work so they know they’re not just one entry on a long list).

I’d approach companies I was interested in even if they didn’t have a job advert live and I’d ask to meet with their HR for a coffee to learn what sort of skills I’d need to hone to be in with a chance of getting a job there. I feel like this sort of enthusiasm would make you memorable.

After this, you’re going to be a name people start to know - I wouldn’t be surprised if people started approaching you with career opportunities even before they go officially live.

Matthew Lee

Title: I Woke Up and the Weekend Was Erased. That's Not the Worst Part.

I’m typing this from the driver's seat of my own car while stuck in a parking lot. I am exhausted, and my hands are shaking so bad the autocorrect is basically writing half of this for me.

Four weeks ago, just another tiring Thursday night, I was lying in bed scrolling my phone. The calendar widget said Thursday. I remember thinking, “Two more minutes and it’s finally Friday. Thank God it’s almost Friday.” I literally watched the clock tick over to 12:00 AM, and my phone said Monday.

Not Friday. Not Saturday. Monday.

I thought it couldn’t be true that I had blacked out for three straight days. But it was just Monday 12:01 AM. It felt like that weird sensation of losing or gaining one hour because of the daylight saving time thingy.

At first, I thought I must have gotten confused (otherwise, what else could it be?), so I ignored what happened, but now I am posting this to let you guys know that this is NOT normal.

It’s been the same every week since. Every time my phone says Thursday and the clock hits 12:00 AM, I close my eyes and wake up to Monday.

On the second week of this madness, I finally asked Thomaz, the Brazilian guy on the same floor: “Hey man, did I miss work last Friday? I think I might’ve been sick or something.” He looked at me like I’d grown a second head. “What are you talking about? What’s Friday?”

I nervously asked him again. “You know… Friday? The day after Thursday? Before Saturday?” He just stared. He chuckled, thinking I was messing with him. “Friday? Is that like… Triday? Or… I don't know, Wemday? Stop making up words, man. We have a meeting in ten minutes.”

Shocking.

I tried Brianna next. Same thing. Ryan, the developer guy. Priya. My boss. The barista in the Main Street café (we call the lobby floor area Main Street for some reason).

None of them knew what Friday was. None of them knew Saturday. None of them knew Sunday. They all gave me the same confused, slightly pitying look. “You okay, Matt? You’re acting really weird today.”

I pulled out my phone and opened the Biblegate app. I remembered Genesis—God worked six days and rested on the seventh. I needed proof the weekend was supposed to exist. I scrolled to chapter 2 (I thought I at least know Genesis a little bit). “And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested…” Yes. That’s the verse I tried to find.

But the text on my screen said something else. “…and after the fourth day the Man continued his labor.”

I refreshed. Same thing. I closed the app, reopened it. Same edited verse. Man? Not God? And continued to labor?

I googled “Genesis 2:2” and every site said the same lie (or I am crazy): the Man never stopped working.

Ok. Then if there is no Sunday, when do you do the church mass or services (I am Catholic—if you know what that means)? I tried searching “catholic church near me.” Nothing. No results. Not even old abandoned ones.

I asked Siri: “What day do people go to church?” She answered: “church is not a modern English word, but it is rarely used to describe a place where people sometimes gather to share inspiring personal stories, but there is no designated building or day for that.”

I said out loud, “Church. You know, mass? Worship? Jesus?” The barista looked up from steaming milk and said, “Jesus? Like… that Mediterranean folk story? That’s just mythology, hon. Cute, though.”

I almost dropped my coffee.

I opened my calendar app. Every week is just Monday → Tuesday → Wednesday → Thursday → Monday. No Friday. No Saturday. No Sunday. No Christmas. No Easter. No nothing.

I called my mom. She answered cheerful like always. “Mom, do you remember weekends? Like… days off?” She laughed. “Days off? Sweetie, everybody works. That’s how it’s always been. You feeling okay?”

I hung up and escaped my office, and now I am sitting in my car in the parking ramp for twenty minutes trying not to hyperventilate.

The worst part isn’t that I lost my weekend. The worst part isn’t that I’m the only one who remembers it ever existed. The worst part is there is no God in this world.

I miss sleeping until late noon. I miss “Thank God it’s Friday.” I miss the park I used to take a stroll on during the weekends. I keep feeling this phantom ache—like my soul is mourning something the rest of the world never had.

Today is Thursday, and I will wake up on Monday morning again. I’m scared. But I am not sure if God will hear my prayer in a world where there is no God in the Bible.

…what happens when the week never ends?

If you’re reading this and you remember Friday, Saturday, and Sunday—please. Please tell me I’m not alone. Please tell me tomorrow will be Friday.",1,1768497019.0,MatthewLeeStories,0,1.0,False

The success of the Scramble for Africans bibliography suggests that, anyway, and so here we go. I'll do fiction above, and nonfiction below.

Most of the fiction was written by Africans, and is valuable for the very different perspectives the authors' characters bring to current issues in their lives, issues which may affect us all (more or less), in addition to the unforgettable qualities of their stories and their prose.

I tested myself on Africa a few days ago, and managed to name and locate 51 of 55 countries (counting Western Sahara). I missed ANGOLA, for god's sake. Sheesh. Well, I thought of it while I was making the list, I just forgot to write it down. And I missed the Seychelles, which is less embarrassing. I forget what the other two I missed were. No, I don't. Lesotho and Eswatini. Forgot they even existed. But overall: not too shabby.

**Fiction:**

Chinua Achebe (Nigeria): Things Fall Apart, and Arrow of God

Why Achebe never got a Nobel Prize is an enduring mystery. His work was certainly worthy. Things Fall Apart is like a poem you can't ever quite figure out. It niggles at you throughout the rest of your life on a daily or weekly basis.

Mongo Beti (Cameroon): Cruel City, and The Poor Christ of Bomba

I've referenced the second book a number of times already ([Smackdown](https://www.reddit.com/r/real_anti_racism/comments/1m8vbl5/smackdown_constructing_ethnicity/), for one) and I do want to warn you all: it's called satire, but it's not at all funny. Cruel City is more enjoyable and lighter entertainment, with wonderful characters and unforgettable situations..

Kaouther Adimi (Algeria): Our Riches

This is a kind of love letter to Algeria, aromatic and inviting. If I had to tell you what the plot was I couldn't do it, though. Nevertheless I highly recommend it. It kind of makes me wish I spoke French, which is the language it was first written in. It kind of makes me wish I lived in Algeria.

Paulina Chiziane (Mozambique): The First Wife

A HILARIOUS look at a very different culture and a very different society. This woman... Oh my god. She's in trouble. And attacking her troubles with energy and determination, if not always quite as much sense as she needs!

Nadine Gordimer (South Africa): July's People, and The Conservationist

She writes of a time that has passed. The first book is a social fantasy built on the relations between the races, in South Africa before apartheid ended, while the social struggle was ongoing and prominent. Although it's a fantasy, it's also clearly grounded in reality. The second book is less educational but very well worth reading anyway. Her power to engage the reader -- well, this reader lol -- is quite unmatched.

NoViolet Bulawayo (Zimbabwe): Glory, and We Need New Names

Disturbing and horrifying tales of the time of Mugabe (and after) in Zimbabwe. I'm sure she'll have a Nobel Prize soon. Her name -- which is a nom de plume -- is where I got my username! Fascinating, eh?

Buchi Emecheta (Nigeria): Second Class Citizen, and Motherhood

The first is melodramatic, a kind of familial adventure story, about what one suspects are actually the author's travels from Nigeria to the UK and her sojourn in both places. I haven't read the second, but I'm told it's very good too.

David Diop (France/Senegal): At Night All Blood is Black

Horrifying and unforgettable. But valuable.

Sindiwe Magona (South Africa): Living, Loving, and Lying Awake at Night

An interrelated set of stories about people who go to modern South Africa for work, what they take with them, what they leave behind. How they relate to the people who are already there.

Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi (Uganda): Let's Tell This Story Properly

An interrelated (more interrelated than the last one) set of stories about people who go from Uganda to the UK, followed by another set of stories about those who then return to Uganda. She's an excellent storyteller. Well, she and Magona both are.

Doris Lessing (Zimbabwe): The Grass is Singing, and The Golden Notebook

She wasn't really African, but British. Nevertheless, the first novel takes place in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe before Mugabe), and is very interesting and engaging, and distinctly African. The second is what she got her Nobel Prize for, and has nothing to do with Africa. But it's one of those books, with History of the Peloponnesian War and Origins of Totalitarianism, upon which a complete intellectual life could fruitfully be spent. A life evergreen.

**Nonfiction:**

Isak Dinesen: Out of Africa

She was a Dane who married a Swedish baron (that is, although she was Danish and a baroness, her baronosity was not Danish, but Swedish) and she and her husband went to Kenya in 1913 to run a coffee orchard. They were divorced by 1920 (her husband really had no interest in the farm), and the orchard failed in 1931, but she became a famous writer, partly for this book and partly for Seven Gothic Tales. This particular book, though, to me has been extremely nourishing. One of my all time favorites, a book, like Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, that I could read happily every two years for the rest of my life.

Jennifer Sessions: By Sword and Plow

I reviewed this at some length earlier ([By Sword and Plow](https://www.reddit.com/r/real_anti_racism/comments/1md6xf9/by_sword_and_plow_by_jennifer_e_sessions_2011/)) and I'm going to have more to say here. It's a remarkably good look at the origins of colonialism in one specific instance. And since Algeria was the first African country to throw off the colonial yoke by force, the events there really set the stage for much of what came after.

Now, I didn't mention it in that review, but one of the more important and more interesting pictures she painted was of the difference between how the leaders of France saw themselves and how their military behaved in the field. The crown prince of France, in private letters to people he cared for, revealed a core of patriotism and idealism that is really unmatched, in its civility and its adherence to the cause of peace. While the brutality of the military effort was, well, not unmatched -- that would come later -- but definitely, as Austen might say, without alloy. There was clearly nothing the military would not do, to get the job done.

And to me this particular discrepancy is one that is important in trying to understand modern life. Preet Bharara, on his podcasts, displays his incontestable grief, at what our modern government has made of the so called American justice system -- but before Trump ever came along, that same justice system had already made our US Constitution into a joke and a pack of lies. That joke, that pack of lies, is what Bharara weeps over, in his desire to bring it back.

Or how about this. The people of Europe, in order to try to convince Americans to oppose their government's efforts to destroy NATO, appeal to our sense of shared values. But those same shared values are apparently not shared enough to permit the different European countries to become one nation. Which would be a very effective response to whatever threat Putin's Russia poses to Europe, and would bring Mario Draghi as much integration of Europe as his little heart could desire.

Well. I know, opinions are like assholes, everybody's got one... Back to my book list:

Tim Jeal: Stanley: The Impossible Life of Africa's Greatest Explorer

This book is most important as a look at the human environment of Africa at the time of Stanley and Livingstone (late 19th century). It gave me the first hint I'd had of the incredible devastation the industrial slave trade wrought, in the interior of the continent, before it ended. And it gave particular examples of the way in which power can send people around the bend. Stanley does not seem to have been one of those people, at least not by Jeal's account, but there are quote unquote ""civilized"" characters in the book who have, by modern standards, become absolutely completely barbaric, as a result of the license the African situation gave them.

Andrew Hussey: The French Intifada: The Long War between France and Its Arabs

A pretty comprehensive look at the modern relationship between France and its Algerians, going back to the 1960s and touching on prior events as well. Highly recommended. He claims -- I don't know if it's true -- that the Algerians learned to fight the French by looking at how the Vietnamese did it, and this inspiration is what led them to begin by terrorizing and brutalizing the moderates of their own people, to bludgeon and frighten their coevals into apparent unanimity. Even today, I know of my own knowledge that to call someone ""Harki"" in Algeria is a term of absolute contempt, and it refers to Algerians who thought the French could be dealt with reasonably, and who tried to do so. The book also makes clear that there was a truly demoralizing level of brutality on the French side of the struggle as well, of which modern life holds few if any comparable examples. Algeria was a tar baby, and the French are still stuck. But you can't claim they didn't do it to themselves.

Piero Gleijeses: Visions of Freedom: Havana, Washington, Pretoria, and the Struggle for Southern Africa, 1976-1991

A diplomatic history of the interactions among the three countries (Cuba, the US, and South Africa), and the relevant African countries as well (Angola, Namibia, and various and sundry others), leading up to the end of apartheid. He makes it pretty clear: Castro was the guy that got it done, the guy that was really most responsible for ending apartheid. I posted a little about this earlier ([Castro](https://www.reddit.com/r/real_anti_racism/comments/1lmjhwl/how_castro_defeated_apartheid/)).

Stephen Chan: Southern Africa: Old Treacheries, New Deceits

A tale of the approach to the end of, and reaction after, apartheid, how the various countries involved (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Zambia) adjusted along the way. The author was not a diplomat, but he helped the diplomats stay informed about things, and so he was very close to diplomatic events. There's apparently more truth in it than in newspaper stories, and probably a good deal less than if it had been written by God, but it's a very interesting account of the whole southern end of the continent over that time period.

Not to mention he reveals much of what he believes was South African perfidy in the struggle to keep apartheid. Apparently they manipulated airport beacons to bring about the crash of Samora Machel's plane (Machel had been the president of Mozambique for 11 years at his death. These events were apparently fictionalized in the book Blood Safari, by Deon Meyer, which I have not read), and started and funded RENAMO, in the same country, brutalizing children into becoming soldiers. Ah, it's all disgusting.

António Tomás: Amilcar Cabral: The Life of a Reluctant Nationalist

Cabral came up so much in my discussions with Africans about who they admired most that I had to find out more about him -- Wikipedia said he led the revolution, in Cabo Verde and Guinea-Bissau -- and I am so so glad I did, because this book was VERY educational.

You see, the Portuguese instituted a two-tier society, in Cabo Verde and Guinea, of which I had had no understanding before. The continent killed the Portuguese, so they used the Cabo Verdeans as tools to rule the Guineans. They created a kind of aristocracy of black Africans who really thought of themselves as Portuguese. Plus I had had no idea beforehand of what the situation really was on the ground in Cabo Verde either, which apparently they have (or had) fairly predictable droughts, followed (of course) by crop failure, followed (you guessed it) by mass starvation. Again and again and again.

Well, the Portuguese really had no interest in all this, except in how it affected their bottom line, and Cabral as an agricultural engineer could see pretty clearly how much needed to be done, and so he was motivated for real. He knew what hunger was, as hopefully none of us do. The whole story is really extremely interesting and informative. Highly recommended.

I feel like there must be more, but I can't think of any. I hope you all find this list valuable.",1,1768496994.0,real_anti_racism,0,1.0,False

I logged in at our normal scheduled time for a remote appointment. My therapist logged on. She looked and sounded awful. She explained to me she was sick, and needed to cancel our appointment. 

I told her this was fine, and immediately followed up with “please text or email me instead next time”. I found it odd she had me log in and talk to her, when she could have just sent me a message. I was also mildly annoyed, because I was in the middle of something I was enjoying (my friend was over for coffee) and I had to stop to log in and have a conversation when it could have been a text.

1qdpahz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qdpahz/a_nocturne_to_madness_part_3/,A Nocturne To Madness: Part 3,"The sliding doors hissed open and the storm followed me in, sheets of rain slapping the glass as if they wanted in too. I was soaked through, trembling with cold and adrenaline, my teeth almost chattering from the fury I’d been chewing on the whole drive.

I stomped to the nurses’ station.
“Cancer ward,” I barked.

The woman behind the desk barely looked up. She had that glassy-eyed, shift’s-almost-over look. “Visiting hours ended a long time ago. Besides, the ward is closed. Cops is all over the place.”

That was it. The lid blew.

“No, no, let’s try this again,” I snapped, leaning over the counter. “Hi, I’m the grandson of the hundred-and-eight-year-old cancer patient you somehow misplaced. I didn’t just drive through God’s own pissstorm because I wanted to play chess in the waiting room. I’m here to talk to the cops, because somebody in this building let a bedridden geriatric waltz into the night!”

Her lips thinned. The click-clack of her keyboard didn’t even slow.

And then I was wrapped in arms. Soft, pale, familiar arms. They wrapped around me from behind, stopping the rant dead in my throat. A small body pressed against my back, cheek nuzzling between my shoulder blades.

“Thank the depths,” she breathed, voice quivering with relief. “You’re safe. I was so worried.”

I turned into the embrace without thinking, without even looking. I didn’t need to. I’d know my wife's arms anywhere. She tilted her face up and brushed a kiss against my cheek. Even now, I can’t get over how lucky I am.

Aria is gorgeous in that way that never feels real. Her skin is pale, flawless, moonlight made flesh. Her hair falls fiery red and straight all the way to her waist, framing a body sculpted like some ancient ideal... a narrow waist flowing into hips men would have started wars over.

But her eyes… God, her eyes were a gift. 

She had heterochromia too, but hers outshone mine by leagues. Her right eye burned gold-amber, sharp and lupine, while her left shimmered a violet so deep it looked alive, gleaming with its own secret knowledge. Looking into them was like falling into a riddle.

“How you holding up?” she asked softly.

I kissed her again, needing the contact, and forced myself to be honest. “Not great. Today’s been… weird. I’m all over the place. I think I’m starting to crack up.”

She smiled, that crooked little smile that always cut through my worst days. “Oooh, can’t have that. If you have to crack, crack down. You won’t hit the tile as hard.”

We pushed through the halls, walking arm-in-arm, ignoring the screech of the nurse behind us. 'Fuck her,' I thought. 'Fuck anyone who can’t spare an ounce of kindness for people who are obviously bleeding inside.'

The elevator doors yawned open. Aria squeezed my arm tighter as we stepped in. She hates elevators, calls them “floating death coffins.” Says she always imagines the cable snapping every time.

I wrapped an arm around her and kissed her hair. “I got you.”

To distract her, I just… started talking. Everything I’d discovered so far tumbled out of me in a rush: the hidden box, the sharkskin journal, the mines, the song. She listened the way only Aria can, like every word was a glass ornament she had to hold carefully.

“Man,” she murmured when I finally ran out of steam, “you have had a weird day.” Then, more serious: “You gonna keep reading it?”

“I have to,” I said. “It was what Pop wanted. Heck, he asked me to write about it. But Christ… how the hell I’m supposed to make a reader believe it is beyond me. It’s insane.”

“You think it’s true, then?” She asked, her two-tone eyes locking on to mine. 

The elevator dinged and the doors opened onto a pale, humming corridor. We stepped out into the cancer ward, fluorescent lights buzzing overhead.

I nodded. “Pop didn’t hold much truck with fiction. And it doesn’t read like he was just making it up. Plus there’s maps, photos, other stuff I haven’t even dug through yet. Feels like corroborating evidence, maybe. Kind of like he wanted proof, in case anyone ever called him a liar.”

We rounded the corner and the first thing I saw was a uniformed cop standing in front of yellow tape, one hand out to keep back a knot of gawkers. For a second it felt surreal, like I’d walked straight into an episode of Castle.

Except the smell wasn’t stage smoke and popcorn. It was brine.

The cop spotted us and gave me a polite nod. “Family?”

“Yeah,” I muttered. “Grandson. Eryk Fauster.”

He checked our IDs and yelled to someone over his shoulder. 

That’s when another man stepped out from behind the tape. Not a uniform, plainclothes. He was tall and scarecrow-thin, a long coat hanging off him like it didn’t quite belong. His cheeks were hollow, his jaw sharp, and his thinning hair looked like it had been fighting the comb since the Reagan administration. He had the kind of face that made you think of an old ivory cameo, all angles and shadows.

“Detective Clyde Grimsby,” he said, voice smooth but stretched thin, like parchment ready to tear. He reached out and shook my hand. “You’d best come in, Mr. Fauster. Bring your wife, too. There are 'things' we'd like you to look at. Maybe see if you can't help us understand what we're seeing.”

The way he said “things” made my stomach tighten. This wasn’t just an old man who'd up and vanished. 

We stepped inside and the smell hit me first. Not antiseptic, not the faint tang of bleach and sickness. Salt. Rotting seaweed. The stench of low tide trapped in four whitewashed walls.

Then I saw it.

Kelp.
Everywhere.

It wasn’t just littered across the floor. It clung to the walls, drooped from the ceiling tiles like wet streamers. But it wasn’t random. No, the strands were arranged. Interlaced. Woven into sprawling geometric patterns that made no sense to the eye and yet… almost did. Shapes that wanted to be letters, curling together into an alphabet I almost recognized.

I tried to focus, and the whole mess seemed to shiver, shifting just enough to make my stomach turn. The longer I stared, the more certain I was that it wasn’t just decoration. It was record-keeping. Words written in a language nobody on earth was supposed to read.

And God help me, something about it tugged at me. A sense of déjà vu. Like the runes were whispering I’d seen them before, in dreams, or somewhere deeper.

“Stay in the box, Mr. and Mrs. Fauster.”

Grimsby’s voice snapped me back. The detective gestured with one long finger to a square of red tape marked on the linoleum. “Please. Evidence control. Don’t disturb the scene.”

I stepped into the taped-off square with Aria at my side, heart hammering. My grandfather’s hospital room looked less like a crime scene and more like the inside of a drowned cathedral.

No... not cathedral... That's too grandiose. But it  was a shrine.

Pop’s deathbed had been made with impossible precision, sheets tucked into sharp military corners as if an inspection was due. At the foot of the bed lay a neatly folded flag, the kind they hand to widows, creased triangles of silence and grief.

And on the pillow, right where his head had rested for the last year, sat his dog tags. The chain looped around a single envelope.

The envelope was sealed with red wax, stamped with that same swirling symbol I’d already seen once... the one from the zebrawood box, the one that made my stomach twist if I looked too long. My name was written across the front in a flowing script I didn’t recognize. Elegant and deliberate.

My hands shook.

This wasn’t a kidnapping scene. There were no signs of struggle, no overturned furniture, no blood. It looked like a send-off. A ritual. A man’s last message arranged with care by hands that weren’t his own.

I didn’t know what to think.

Grimsby’s voice cut through my thoughts. “Yeah… we don’t know what to make of it either.”

I flinched, half-convinced the scarecrow detective had just read my mind. Then I realized I must’ve spoken out loud. Either he didn’t notice my twitch, or he ignored it.

He folded his long arms, the cuffs of his coat dangling like loose sails. “It’s obviously some kind of ritual. Maybe a kidnapping, though I’ll be damned if we’ve got anything like it on record. Nothing even close. And the blackout?” He shook his head. “Not an accident. Somebody cut the power. We pulled the logs. Timed it to the minute.”

He glanced at the sealed envelope on the pillow like it might spit venom. “Whoever did this wanted the lights out. Wanted privacy for… whatever this was.”

“They did all of this…” My voice cracked as I swept an arm toward the kelp-stained walls. “In a five-minute blackout? In the middle of a hurricane? How the hell did they even get in?”

Grimsby shook his head, the motion awkward on his thin frame. “That’s another weird thing. Closest guess is the window.” He let that hang a second, like he knew how insane it sounded. We were on the 8th floor...

“But we’ve had teams crawl over every inch of this place,” he went on, voice dry as the Sunday paper. “No trace of kelp in the hallways, no seawater anywhere else in the building. If they dragged it in, they did it without leaving so much as a drip trail. And if they did carry it in?” He gestured at the walls, at the ceiling laced with weeds. “They’d have needed a wheelbarrow. Maybe two. Not something you sneak past security in the middle of a goddamn hurricane.”

“Has anyone read the letter?” I asked. My throat felt dry, like I’d just swallowed a mouthful of sand.

Grimsby shook his head. “No. We were waiting on you. Offered to let your wife look first, but she declined.” His hollow eyes flicked toward Aria. “Said it should be yours. In case it was your grandfather’s last words.”

""It would have felt like prying..."" She said softly, and patted my arm. ""I didn't want to see what was meant just for you."" 

My voice trembled. “May I see it?”

Grimsby was already pulling a pair of latex gloves from his coat pocket. He handed them over, his long fingers twitching as if even touching the plastic made him uneasy.

“Yeah,” he said. “Go on. Just… don’t touch it barehanded. And once you’re done, I’ll need to bag it for evidence.”

The envelope sat on the pillow like a relic in a reliquary, wax seal glistening faintly under the fluorescent lights. My name shimmered in that elegant script, patient and deliberate, like someone had taken their time to make every curve perfect.

My hands shook as I slipped the gloves on.

Grimsby crossed the room with those long, deliberate strides of his, stepping around the kelp with extreme care. He plucked the envelope from the pillow with two fingers and carried it back to me, holding it as though it might shatter.

“Be careful,” he warned. “Thing’s soaked through.”

I took it gingerly, heart pounding. It was far too heavy for paper. Solid, weighty, wrong.

Hands trembling inside the latex gloves, I slid a finger under the wax seal. To my surprise, it parted with almost no resistance, crumbling away like it had been waiting for me.

Inside wasn’t paper.

It was slate. A smooth, black shard, cold against my skin even through the gloves. Etched across its surface in delicate, perfect strokes were words that stopped my breath cold.

""Eryk,

Don’t cry, boy. I’m gone. But I go to rest now with the dead and dreaming one beneath the ice. The city of my dreams waits for me. My wife and daughters are waiting there.

Love,
Pop""


The lines glinted faintly, like they were flecked with mica or something. I started to slip the slate back into the envelope, when something else slid out.

A photo.

Old, curling at the edges, the kind of sepia tint that said 1940s without needing a date stamp. I caught it in my hand before it hit the floor, and when I turned it over my chest locked tight.

It was Pop.

Not the frail, wasted figure I’d watched fade away this past year, but young and brutal. Built like a tank, a cigar clamped between his teeth. He wasn’t dressed for parade or patrol... he was dressed for war. Flak jacket, dive suit and web gear. Grenades were strapped to his chest like grim jewelry. And in his hands, a Browning Automatic Rifle like it belonged there.

But it wasn’t the Clay’s deck he was standing on. Or any destroyer for that matter. No... The lines of the vessel where this photo was taken were unmistakable even to an amateur like me. For in the background rose the conning tower of a Balao-class submarine.

And standing beside him…

A man I didn’t know and yet recognition hit me like a wave. Shorter than Pop, leaner, but no less dangerous. His face was carved from stone, calm and calculating even in frozen sepia. The kind of man who could vanish in a phone booth and make you swear he’d never been there at all.

Mercer.

I don’t remember leaving the room. All I remember is the taste of bile clawing up my throat, my stomach trying to turn itself inside out. I staggered into the hall, gagging, and the next thing I knew I was on the floor.

That was when the first dream came.

I was floating in dim, frozen water. Sightless, breathless. The cold pressed into me from every angle, heavy as stone. My chest burned, lungs spasming, but no air came.

Out of the dark, a sound rose.

Singing.

Not muffled, not distorted by wave or distance... impossibly clear, carried through the water as if the ocean itself were a speaker. Every note was sharp as glass, sweet as honey. Beautiful and dreadful, like sweetened arsenic. 

And I was caught in it. Caught in a rolling tide of pain and ecstasy that tore through me in waves. Pleasure and agony, braided together so tightly they became the same thing. My soul was burning, freezing, shattering and all of it issued from that one, impossible voice.

Except it wasn't one voice. 

It was dozens. Hundreds.

All singing in impossibly perfect harmony. 

They rose all around me, threading together into a chorus that filled the sea and the marrow of my bones. They weren’t just singing to me... they were singing through me, dragging my pulse into their rhythm. My body vibrated with it, as if I’d become another instrument in their choir.

I spun in the water, thrashing for the source. And then I saw.

Beneath me sprawled a city.

Not ruins. Not wreckage. A living place, impossibly vast. Towers stretched upward in crooked majesty, their angles both perfect and impossible, mind-rending and magnificent all at once. Streets coiled like serpents, avenues widened into plazas that could have swallowed entire towns. It sprawled for miles, vanishing into a horizon of darkness.

And at its heart, a gate.

A massive stone arch, older than language, older than the sea itself. Eldritch and eternal. The moment my eyes touched it, I knew. If I crossed beneath that arch, I would never know the world of land and light again. I would be remade. Claimed.

It pulled at me with a gravity stronger than any current.

I kicked, fought, clawed at the water like a child drowning in a pool, but the tide was inevitable, and it was drawing me in.

And then the voices changed. They became a chant and an exultation. 

I froze as the ancient gate cracked. Just a hairline split in the darkness of the deep, and from it poured light as black as ink... thick and liquid, darkness so bright it burned my eyes.

What I glimpsed through that fracture would have claimed my mind if I could have but understood it. 

Something moved beyond the arch. Vast. Wrong. Taller than any cathedral, any mountain. No god could have made such a beast. Not one that loved the world of men.

Then, from the gap, it came.

A single tentacle, one strand of the monster’s beard, slid through, lashing out with impossible speed across the miles between me and that wicked and twisting gate. It wrapped around my leg, cold and slick, and began to pull.

I screamed and kicked, thrashing in vain as the city fell away beneath me and the gate loomed closer.

In desperation I opened my mouth, sucking water into my lungs, praying for the release of drowning.

But the sea betrayed me!

The water became air as it filled me. My chest expanded. My scream came out whole.

The beast would not even let me die! Its will was iron and I was to be his! 

Then there were hands on me, soft and comforting. But it was wrong! 

Wicked twisted things! 

The fingers curled too far, bending at joints no human bones should have. Skin that felt smooth at first touch rippled like fish scales beneath. The hands cradled me the way a mother holds a child, and for a heartbeat I wanted to believe in them. 

The song changed.

The chorus swelled, too perfect, too harmonious, voices braided into a sound that was both lullaby and command.

'Be not afraid,' they said. Their words were not spoken but pressed directly into my mind, warm as breath against my ear. 'We will not harm you, beloved. He wants only to meet you.'

The hands stroked my face with a tenderness that made bile rise in my throat. I tried to wrench away, but their grip was gentle and unbreakable, a prison dressed as an embrace.

I jolted awake on the hospital hallway floor, convulsing. My stomach clenched and I heaved, a ragged scream tearing from my throat as seawater thick, and pure poured out of my mouth in choking gushes. It splattered across the linoleum, spreading into a slick, dark puddle.

Aria scrambled back from where she’d been cradling me, her hands lifting from my chest as though burned. Her eyes were wide, reflecting the harsh fluorescent lights.

“Eryk…” she whispered, voice thin with fear.

I wiped my mouth with a shaking sleeve, the salt sting clinging to my lips and tongue. My lungs felt raw, as if I’d truly drowned and been dragged back by something that didn’t want to let me go.

And in the echoes of my own retching, I swore I could still hear them, the voices, vocalizing faintly at the edge of hearing.

I wept into my hands. ""Stop... Stop. It's too much... I can't take it."" 

Aria rushed back to my side, and began humming softly, stroking my hair. Touching my shoulders. ""It's alright, Eryk. How can I help? Just tell me..."" 

I was scaring her and she was trying to help. That settled me, somehow. It's weird isn't it? The way people are sometimes? We can't handle things alone but we can be tougher, stronger for somebody else. 

I would have cried for hours if I had been alone on that floor, but in front of Aria and all these people I didn't want to be weak. I shoved the terror, the confusion, and the hurt down into a box somewhere inside. 

""I'm ok, I'm ok,"" I rasped, dragging air into my lungs as if it had to be mined from stone. ""I just... Today’s been too much. I want to go home.""

Aria’s arms slid around me before the last word left my mouth. She didn’t flinch from the brackish stink. She just held me, tight and steady, her voice soft against my ear.
""I can take you home,"" she whispered. ""Let’s get you out of here.""

Over her shoulder, Grimsby crouched to retrieve the letter and the photograph, tucking them carefully into an evidence sleeve. His expression was unreadable for a moment, all shadows and bone angles, then he straightened and gave me a nod.
“Sorry for putting you through that,” he said, tone clipped but not unkind. “I know it wasn’t easy. We’ll take it from here.”

The words should have sounded routine, a line from any case file, but in that moment I almost believed him. Almost.

“Just call me once you’re settled and we can talk this thing out once you’re stable, kid.” Grimsby held out a card. His hand didn’t waver. Mine did, just a little, when I took it.

Aria guided me out, her arm never leaving my back.

Home. 

God, I’d never been so glad for that word. 

Our place was a modest beachfront condo, third floor of a walk-up, sand-stained railings and all. It used to be a vacation rental before the owner passed away, then the place slipped onto the market. 

Aria and I had always dreamed of living by the ocean, and somehow, between her YouTube covers, her Twitch streams, and my stubborn tapping at a keyboard, we made it happen.

When we pushed through the door, the familiar scent of sea salt and coffee grounds wrapped around me like a quilt. For the first time all day, my shoulders dropped. I could relax. 

I flopped onto the couch, half-tempted to let sleep take me. But the memory of that nightmare snapped me upright. I couldn’t risk sliding back into it. Instead I showered, and cleaned myself up, washing away the stink of the day. 

I slipped into another fugue state in the shower, letting the water just roll over me, completely smooth brained. I only jolted back to reality once it had turned cold. I shuddered. How long had I been in there? Over an hour, at least...

Outside, the storm had spent itself down to a lazy drizzle, rain tapping the glass in soft, steady rhythms. In the kitchen, Aria busied herself with dinner, our unspoken truce of trading off nights at the stove. The familiar clatter of pans was comfort enough.

I put on my slippers and housecoat and wandered out to the back deck. The sea air was sharp, and clean. No hint of rot or darkness to it. My coat, which was filthy from the days misadventures went over the far chair to air out.  From its pocket I drew Pop’s journal. I lowered myself into the chair opposite with a sigh, packed my pipe, and lit it. Smoke curled up into the wet air.

Then I opened the old sharkskin cover again, this time not as a grieving grandson, but as a man desperate for answers.

1qdpaek,https://www.reddit.com/r/studytips/comments/1qdpaek/how_i_learned_to_study_effectively_not_ai_slop/,How I learned to study effectively (not AI slop),"Hi guys, as someone who used to struggle with studying in the past, I wanted to share some tips that helped me learn to study for long periods of time.

About me: I recently finished a masters degree in a difficult STEM specialisation, with high grades. However, I wasn't always like this. In school I was an average student who had problems with focus. I was never a teachers favorite

I noticed a change in these 3 things lead to better focus:

\- Mindset

\- Environment

\- Routine

**Mindset**

I had to believe I can do it. I had to let go of the mental shackles, thoughts of inadequacy, feeling that I'm a bad student, that I can't ever get good grades or get good at math. One thing I realised many years after graduating high school was just how common these feelings were for other students. So many others had these narratives placed in their mind by someone external, like their teachers or fellow students. You need to start believing in yourself to start this journey. 

  
**Environment**

Whether its at home or in the library, you need to find a quiet and comfortable place where you can sit down and work without many distractions. Many people prefer the library since its an environment where everyone else is studying, which helps you focus yourself. If you're studying from home you can try buying LED lights, scent candles, playing music, getting a cup of coffee, whatever you think is comfy and can get you in the right headspace. The goal here is to get into the right mental state and create a good and comfortable atmosphere for studying. 

**Routine**  
This one is the hardest to maintain and usually adds up and is created after you sorted out the previous 2 points of **Environment & Mindset.** Either way, find ways of building a routine where you're studying as frequently as possible. Your goal isn't to do one big study session a weel but rather a little bit day by day. What helped me was finding ""study-with-me"" videos and trying to study along with it for that day. I'd set mini mental deadlines for myself like ""this week I'll try to study 4 hours a day"". 

I didn't figure it out overnight, instead this is a culmination of years of trial and error, and seeing what worked and what didn't. Don't take this post as a guide, but rather see what parts resonate with you.

  
TL:DR you need to fix your mindset, create or find a study-positive environment and build a routine.",1,1768496960.0,studytips,0,1.0,False
1qdpa4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1qdpa4k/12_days_levofloxacin_update_2_months_out/,12 Days Levofloxacin - Update 2 Months Out,"TL;DR

I'm 2 months out from my last pill and have delt with several flare ups, physically and mentally. I can still walk and move around the house despite a lot of muscle twitching all over my body and neuropathy. Still need to deal with my bacterial prostatitis since levo seems to have not gotten rid of it, but anxious and waiting before going on a different antibiotic. Prostatitis symptoms are still very mild as they always have been. Trying to stay positive and take solace in the fact I can still work and live my day to day life like before floxing.



Today marks 2 months since I took my 12th and final Levofloxcin 500mg pill. I can safely say that I am beginning to understand just how non linear recovery is during all this. I've had days at a time where I feel great with less anxiety and little to no neuropathy, while other days my anxeity is intense, my arms and legs are heavier, my muscles all over my body are twitching, and im sensitive to touch. The idea of how back and forth this is has been difficult to reconcile and doesn't make much sense, but then again I am not expert on the human body.

Today it feels like I am on the tail end of a flare up. This past weekend I went to a bowling party with some friends where I had a few drinks. First time I got close to drunk since before floxing. Honestly the biggest thing I feared was my wrist and arms flaring up after that night. Instead after that night and having a few cups of coffee in the morning, the muscles in my legs and arms started twitching like crazy. When walking around it felt like I was getting split second mini muscle cramps all over my leg that would disappear as quickly as they showed up. Afew days later and that has gotten better again.

As for how I am doing in general, I am still able to go on my 1.5 mile - 2 mile walks. Even did two 3 mile walks back to back last week and was fine. My right Achilles tendon is still sore but not outright painful to walk on. The right temple and eyelid twitching I spoke about in pervious posts has almost completely disappeared in that it only twitches very subtly maybe once to 3 time a day...rather than almost constantly.

For supplements I've continued to take 400mg CoQ10, 400mg Mg Glycenate before bed, 2x Olly mens mutivitamin gummies, 500-1000mg vitamin C, and 1250mg Omega 3 fish oil. I did try 300mg ALA for a week which I cannot say if it helped or not. I would take it with lunch and it sometimes felt like I had more energy? Didn't seem to do anything about the muscle twitching and neuropathy though. Not sure if it made the twitching more prominent either. Will talk to my GP about that in my next visit.

  
As for my anxiety, it comes and goes with the symptoms. Feeling the weakness and increased twitching of a flare up certainly increases it. I've also been struggling with the somewhat irrational fear of this turning into something MUCH worse like ALS since there is overlap with some of the symptoms. That said I've done a ton of research and combed through this subreddit and nowhere do I see anyone talking about developing ALS.

Finally as for my bacterial prostatitis, shortly after I stopped the levo and my urologist put me on cefpodoxime, the **very mild** symptoms I had with that came back. Namely SOMETIMES when I pee I feel the smallest amount of discomfort in my pelvic floor or at the tip of my penis. That and **think** my urine has been more foamy since the infection. Those symptoms persist to this day but remain very mild and manageable. That said, I know i'll need to address it as you SHOULD NEVER let an infection linger but, i'll be honest, I am so scared of going on another antibiotic. I know they will likely put me on Bactrim and I know the chance of neuropathy from Bactrim is much less but I am still crazy anxious about it.

All in all, I am hanging in there. Trying to find positives in the fact that I am still able to walk  and do the things I enjoy. As a software engineer I can still work, can still play the video games I enjoy, hang out with my friends on discord and VRChat like I always did, go for walks, and make plans to spend time with friends on the weekend. That said, I feel for people who are more active than me and have lost their ability to work out, hike, go to the gym, bike, etc. I never really did much of these things and yet still feel horrible that if I wanted to, I may not be able to pick them up for some time.

We will see what the next few months have in store. My assumption is that I am in this for the long haul and, like many others, may not start seeing real consistent and definitive improvements until month 6-12. That's not going to stop me from going on a Japan trip coming up in April. I can still walk god dammit and I'll be damned if I let this get in the way of enjoying this vacation with my partner and our friends.",1,1768496944.0,floxies,0,1.0,False

1qdp8de,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskOldPeopleAdvice/comments/1qdp8de/im_23_and_completely_lost_what_should_i_do/,I'm 23 and completely lost? what should I do?,"I’m turning 24 in a couple of months, and I feel like I have absolutely nothing to show for it.

No degree.  
No full-time job.  
No money.  
I work part-time in a coffee shop and I’m in debt.

I dropped out of university twice, largely because my mental health collapsed. It’s something I’ve struggled with for as long as I can remember, but during my degree it got significantly worse. The stress at home and at uni fed into each other until I genuinely entered a crisis.

My parents hate each other and have spent years using me and my siblings as collateral in their arguments. My mother remarried and decided to have another child — which I hate admitting, but I resent deeply. There’s a 22-year age gap between me and my new sibling, and it feels like another responsibility I never asked for, layered onto an already overwhelming situation.

My siblings either treat me like a wallet or like I’m the root of all their problems. My family aren’t people who like me, let alone love me, and living in that environment while trying to study, maintain friendships, and hold myself together completely eroded my confidence. I started to believe there was something fundamentally wrong with me.

University made that feeling worse. I genuinely felt like the dumbest person in every room. Nothing I was learning in either course seemed to stick. I had no friends in my classes, I was always left out, and I never felt like I belonged. It ate away at me slowly until existing felt unbearable. I didn’t just feel behind — I felt broken.

After I dropped out, I worked full time for a while and, honestly, it was fine. For the first time I felt functional. Then the same patterns came back. My mother needed money. Then my siblings needed money. Then I was right back where I started — drained, resentful, stuck in the same role I’ve always been in.

Now I’m watching my younger siblings graduate and move forward with their lives while I feel frozen in place, still dealing with trauma that seems to have singled me out. I had big dreams for myself. I wanted to graduate, move out, and build a life I was proud of. Instead, my 20s have mostly been spent stuck in my room, too broke and too exhausted to do anything memorable.

I know this probably sounds like self-pity. I know, in theory, that things can change. What I don’t know is *how*. How do you actually jump back from this when you’re already burnt out, mentally unwell, financially trapped, and living in an environment that keeps pulling you backwards?

I’m the oldest daughter, and my family treats me like I’m incompetent — unstable, incapable, something to be managed. I’m talked down to constantly, and it’s hard not to believe it after years of hearing it. I’m fed up, but I have nowhere else to go and no safety net.

I feel trapped by money, by my mental health, by my family, and by the fear that I’ve already ruined my future.

At 28, juggling a desk job in marketing and zero industry connections, I was the last person anyone would scout at a coffee shop. But one random Tuesday changed everything—my sister's wedding photos went viral on Instagram (12k likes, who knew?), and a comment popped up: ""You should model. Agencies are signing 'real people' now."" Skeptical but bored, I DM'd a local photographer from a Craigslist ad. Fast-forward 6 months: I've booked 3 paid gigs, including a sustainable fashion shoot for a small eco-brand, earning $800 on my first real paycheck. Here's the raw truth—no fluff, just what worked for me and pitfalls I dodged.

# The ""Scout Yourself"" Hack

Agencies get 100s of headshots daily, but they prioritize fresh faces with personality over perfection. I skipped $200 pro shoots and used my iPhone against a white wall (natural light at 4 PM golden hour is magic). Key tweak: 5 photos max, showing range—smiling casual, fierce editorial, profile side-eye. Answer to the top question I see: Height/agency minimums? 5'7""+ helps for fashion, but commercial/print loves 5'4""-6'0"" everyday builds. I got callbacks because my shots screamed ""approachable yet striking,"" not filtered Barbie.

# Dodging the Red Flags

First ""gig"" offer? Shady dude via Facebook wanted ""TFCD"" (time for clothes/digitals) plus $50 gas money—total scam vibe. Pro tip: Legit opportunities never ask for upfront fees or nude tests pre-contract. I verified via Google reverse image search on their portfolio (saved me twice). Earnings reality: Beginners average $150-500 per shoot (local), scaling to $2k+ for catalog work. Taxes? Track everything—1099 forms hit hard if you're gigging steady.

# The Momentum Shift

Networking flipped the script. Joined free model/photog Discord servers (search ""model mayhem alternatives""), traded TFP shoots for portfolio gold. One collab led to an agency intro: ""We need relatable influencers for e-comm brands."" Now, I'm turning down lowball offers. If you're lurking with doubts—age, ""normal"" body, no experience—it's doable. The industry's shifting post-2025 trends: Diverse sizes (10-18 thriving), older newbies (25+), and AI-free authenticity rules. What's your barrier? Drop it below.

I am aware of and scan events and meetup sites but wanted to know from you, what would you do if you had to fill up two weeks of activities to know the town and to socialize a little bit. If you know of specific hikes, trivia nights, or events for solo/single travelers happening in the next couple of weeks, please let me know. I dont mind driving a little bit but 30 mins or less within the Winter Garden community would be great.

And if you wanted to meet for coffee or a walk around town I'm open to it. DM me so we can share more about each other but I'm basically 43M, from Maryland, Software Engineer, progressive, straight but I like making friends of all walks of life, I prefer the outdoors, I drink occasionally but don't do bar hoping or stuff like that unless part of a social component. 

Let me know your suggestions and if you have any questions. Thank you!

Still, I would really appreciate any advice on how to handle this situation.**

**TL;DR:**  
**I’m in a long-distance relationship where I feel I’m putting in much more effort than my boyfriend. He rarely initiates calls, replies late with short messages, and hasn’t kept his promise of regular video calls. This makes me feel emotionally neglected.**

**He had a long, intense relationship with his ex and, although they broke up due to toxicity, they are friends again and he even talked to her about me, which makes me uncomfortable. The way he talks about her and the fact that she’s close to his family makes me fear he still has unresolved feelings.**

**He recently changed plans and decided to move back to his home city instead of staying near his current city for a PhD, due to visa and financial concerns. This means we’ll be long-distance for at least six more months, and I’m afraid the distance and his ex’s proximity could lead him to leave me for her.**

**I don’t think he’d cheat, but my insecurities are triggered by past experiences with an ex who wasn’t over his exes. I want to know if my fears are reasonable, how to manage my insecurity, and whether this relationship can realistically work.**

COMPLETE BACKGROUND:

Background about my bf: He was born in the same country as me, but has lived in a neighboring country for 10 years. His home city and current city are around 3 hours apart by car. He's currently doing his master's and works two shifts (7–11 a.m. and 6–10 p.m.). He also lives with relatives who rely on him for many errands, so he’s usually busy and tired. He met his ex while visiting his home city and they did long distance for around 4 years. He broke up with her due to toxicity in the relationship 3 years ago and blocked her everywhere. A fewmonths before I met him (this year) she contacted him through a friend and asked him if there was any possibility they could get back together and he refused. After that they became friends and she told him about the issues he had with her partner (I'm not sure if she's still dating this new guy). My bf says he only talks to her if she contacts him first.

About my relationship with my bf: We met late September while I was doing a semester abroad in his country. It started casually and later became official. He treated me well in small ways (like bringing me coffee), and we saw each other about once a week (more frequently toward the end), sometimes staying together until very late. However, there where some issues that where very frustrating to me: cancelling dates last minute,not returning calls, taking too long to respond to my texts, he also never properly asked me to be his gf, he just started introducing me as such and later asked if I was ok with it. I made effort to make sure he felt loved by helping him whenerver I could, but maybe I wasn't doing enough. We dated in person for around 3 months and have been doing long distance for 1 month.

Current situation: Long distance has been hard, sometimes he takes too long to answer texts and if he answers fast it's mostly short replies and I don't always like it when he turns the conversation into something sexual. He promised me we could do videocalls 3 times a week, so far it's been 4 times in the span of 5 weeks and I'm always the one that takes the initiative and ask him to call me. The first time we even had a fight because he didn't call me at the time we agreed and I had to call him and then the call ended abruptly because he ran out of battery. He promised he will take more initiative but hasn't done anything about it.

The issue with his ex: Whenever he talks about his ex iit feels like he still misses her. He has said he’ll never forget her, which I understand, but the way he talks about their past makes me feel like he loved her more than he will ever love me. He had told me that they facetimed and texted a lot, had dates, gave her flowers and he has never done those things for me. I understand he had more free time back then and she lived closer by, but it still makes me feel like he's making excuses for me. One time he posted me on my instagram and he told me she messaged him: ""Is that your new gf?"" and he talked to her about me, which made me feel a little uncomfortable.When I talk about my ex, I only mention behaviors that hurt me and that I don’t want repeated. A few weeks ago I asked him to not talk about his ex because I just keep comparing myself to her.

MAIN ISSUE: He had told me that after graduating this May he was going to move to another city in the same state to do his PhD and work. However, yesterday he told me he canceled those plans and will move back to his home city instead. He said it’s because he’s worried about renewing his permit (he’s not a permanent resident) and about money. This confused me because he’s lived there for 10 years and had been saving to become a permanent resident. I can somehow understand because laws in that country have become more strict regarding foreigners.

MY INSECURITY:I feel very anxious about him suddenly moving back, especially since I won’t graduate until December, meaning we’ll be apart for at least six more months. He has always said I could move with him after graduating, even before changing his plans. I don't think I am going to feel comfortable if his ex contacts him (she still lives in his home city) again, which could happen since she became close to his family. I don't think he will cheat on me but I feel like there is a high chance he could leave me for her because they would be able to have a normal relationship without the distance. He told me that when he was with her, he often asked her to “wait for him,” and it seems like she still wants him back. This triggers me deeply because my previous ex left me because he was never over his first ex and was secretly talking to another ex.

MY QUESTIONS:

Part of me still has hope that things might improve once he moves back to his city and has more time, but I feel very unsure about where this is going. Still, I want to try to make it work.",1,1768496532.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I was waking up at 11am every day and my life was going nowhere.

I’d set my alarm for 7am, hit snooze five times, finally drag myself out of bed at 11, feel like shit about wasting half the day, then spend the rest of the day playing catch up and feeling behind.

My mornings were rushed and chaotic. Wake up late, panic, skip breakfast, throw on clothes, barely make it to work on time. Start every day already stressed and behind before I even did anything.

I had zero time for myself. By the time I woke up I had to immediately start dealing with work and responsibilities. No time to work out, no time to read, no time to think. Just straight from bed into the chaos of the day.

I was 27 years old and I’d been a chronic late sleeper my entire adult life. Staying up until 2 or 3am gaming or scrolling, sleeping until noon on weekends, always feeling tired despite sleeping 9 or 10 hours.

I’d tried to wake up early dozens of times. Would set my alarm for 6am, wake up feeling exhausted, hit snooze, and eventually just turn it off and sleep until my body naturally woke up hours later.

Every productivity article and successful person said wake up early. I’d read about people waking at 5am and getting so much done and think “I could never do that, I’m not a morning person.” Used that as an excuse for years.

Then I realized “not being a morning person” was just an identity I’d created to justify sleeping in. It wasn’t a personality trait, it was a habit. And habits can change.

So I committed to something that seemed impossible: wake up at 5am every single day for 60 days. No snoozing, no exceptions, no matter how tired I felt.

It was brutal at first but it completely transformed my life and proved I’m capable of way more than I thought.

## What I actually did

**Went to bed at 9pm every night**

You can’t wake up at 5am if you’re going to bed at 2am. The math doesn’t work. So I had to completely restructure my evening routine.

Started getting ready for bed at 8:30pm. In bed with phone in another room by 9pm. Lights off, reading until I fell asleep. Usually asleep by 9:30pm.

This was the hardest part honestly. Going to bed at 9pm when you’re used to staying up until 2am feels wrong. Felt like I was missing out on my evening free time.

**Put my alarm across the room**

Set my alarm for 5am and put it on the other side of the room so I had to physically get out of bed to turn it off.

Once I was standing up, rule was I couldn’t get back in bed. No matter how tired, no matter how much I wanted to. Feet on the floor meant the day started.

**No snooze button, ever**

This was non negotiable. The alarm goes off at 5am, I get up. No snooze, no “5 more minutes,” no negotiating with myself. Alarm rings, I stand up.

Breaking this rule even once would’ve destroyed the habit. Had to be absolute.

**Used structure to build the morning routine**

I found this app called Reload on Reddit that builds complete 60 day structured plans. It asked about my current wake time and goals, then built a progressive plan.

Week one it had me waking at 5am and immediately doing a simple routine: drink water, cold shower, 20 minute workout, coffee, read for 15 minutes. By the time I finished it was 6:30am and I’d accomplished more than I used to in entire days.

The app also blocked all time wasting sites from 5am to 9am so I couldn’t wake up early and then just scroll my phone. That forced productivity during my morning hours.

**Made morning time sacred**

The hours between 5am and 9am became my time. No checking email, no meetings, no obligations. Just me working on my priorities before the world woke up.

That protected time was when I’d work out, read, work on side projects, learn skills, do deep work. Everything that mattered got done in the morning before anyone else could take my attention.

-----

## DAY 1-7: Absolute misery

The first week was genuinely terrible. I’d wake up at 5am feeling like I’d been hit by a truck.

Day 1 the alarm went off at 5am and every cell in my body screamed to hit snooze. Forced myself up, stood there in the dark wanting to die, but I was up.

Day 2 was worse. My body wasn’t used to the new schedule. Felt exhausted all day even though I’d slept 8 hours. Wanted to quit and go back to sleeping until 11.

Day 3 I almost broke. The alarm went off, I stood up, and immediately wanted to get back in bed. Took a cold shower just to shock myself awake.

By day 5 I was going to bed at 9pm naturally because I was so exhausted. My body was adjusting but it was rough.

Day 7, one week done. I’d woken at 5am for 7 straight days. The mornings were still hard but I was doing it. And I’d gotten more done in that week than the previous month.

-----

## DAY 8-14: My body started adapting

Week two my body began adjusting to the new schedule.

Waking at 5am still sucked but it sucked less. I’d open my eyes when the alarm went off instead of feeling paralyzed. Still tired but functional.

The structure Reload built increased gradually. Week two added 30 minute workouts and 20 minutes of reading. My mornings were packed with productive things.

By day 10 I was falling asleep at 9pm without trying. My circadian rhythm was shifting.

Day 14, two weeks. I’d woken at 5am for 14 straight days. Starting to feel like maybe I could actually do this.

-----

## DAY 15-30: Everything changed

Weeks three and four I started seeing real benefits.

I was waking at 5am and actually feeling awake. Not exhausted and dragging, actually ready to start the day. My body had fully adjusted.

My productivity was insane. By 9am I’d worked out, read for 30 minutes, and done 2 hours of deep work. Most people were just waking up and I’d already had a full productive morning.

My energy throughout the day was better. Instead of being groggy until noon then crashing at 3pm, I had consistent energy from 5am to 9pm.

I was getting 10 hours of my life back every week. The time between 5am and 7am that used to be sleeping was now productive time. That’s 70 hours over 7 weeks, almost two full work weeks of extra time.

Day 21, three weeks. People at work were commenting that I seemed more focused and energetic. I was getting more done by noon than most people did all day.

Day 30, one month. This was the longest I’d ever maintained an early wake time. I was never going back to sleeping until 11.

-----

## DAY 31-45: Became my superpower

Weeks five and six waking at 5am became my competitive advantage.

I was finishing side projects before work. Learning new skills every morning. Reading a book every week. Working out 6 days a week. All before most people woke up.

My mornings were completely mine. No one emailing me, no one calling, no distractions. Pure uninterrupted time to focus on what mattered to me.

Started a side business using my morning hours. Two hours of focused work every morning before my day job. By week six I’d built and launched something that had been “on my list” for 2 years.

Day 40, people were asking what changed about me. I had more energy, was more productive, seemed more together. Told them I wake up at 5am and they looked at me like I was crazy.

-----

## DAY 46-60: This became who I am

The last two weeks waking at 5am wasn’t a challenge anymore, it was just who I was now.

I’d become a morning person. The identity I’d held for years that “I’m not a morning person” was completely false. I’d just never actually tried to be one.

My entire life was structured around those morning hours. That’s when I worked out, read, learned, built things, did deep work. The most important hours of my day.

I had time for everything I always said I didn’t have time for. Work out? Done by 6am. Read? 30 minutes before 7am. Side projects? 2 hours before 9am. No excuses anymore.

Day 60, mission complete. I’d woken at 5am for 60 straight days. Never missed once. Proved to myself I could do something I thought was impossible.

-----

## What actually changed in 60 days

**I got 120 hours of my life back**

Waking at 5am instead of 11am gave me 6 extra hours per day. Over 60 days that’s 360 hours. I used that time to work out, read, learn skills, build a business. 360 hours of productive time I used to spend sleeping.

**My productivity exploded**

Getting my most important work done before 9am meant nothing could derail my day. By the time distractions and obligations started, I’d already accomplished my priorities.

**My energy levels stabilized**

No more sleeping 10 hours and waking up groggy. 8 hours of quality sleep from 9pm to 5am gave me more energy than 10 hours from 2am to noon ever did.

**I built discipline in every area**

If I could wake up at 5am every day, I could do anything. That discipline bled into diet, exercise, work, everything. Waking up early became proof I’m capable of commitment.

**My mental clarity improved dramatically**

Those early morning hours when my brain was fresh became when I did my best thinking and work. No brain fog, no distractions, just peak cognitive performance.

**I had time for everything I “didn’t have time for”**

Work out 6 days a week? Done. Read 30 minutes daily? Done. Learn new skills? Done. Build a side business? Done. All in the hours I used to spend sleeping.

**I became the person I wanted to be**

I’d always admired people who woke up early and got shit done. Now I was that person. Changed how I saw myself completely.

-----

## The reality, the first month was brutal

Those first 30 days were genuinely hard. Waking at 5am when your body is used to 11am feels terrible. You’re tired all day, you want to quit constantly, every morning is a battle.

There were so many times I wanted to sleep in. Weekends were especially hard. Seeing my alarm go off at 5am on Saturday when I could sleep in was torture.

What kept me going was the structure from Reload giving me things to do immediately when I woke up so I couldn’t talk myself back into bed, the blocking keeping me off my phone during morning hours, and seeing the results from those productive mornings.

By week five it clicked and became natural. But those first 4 weeks required serious commitment.

-----

## If you want to become a morning person

Accept that the first month will suck. You’ll be tired, you’ll want to quit, every morning will be hard. Push through anyway because it gets dramatically better.

Go to bed early. You can’t wake at 5am on 5 hours of sleep. Get in bed by 9pm, lights off by 9:30pm. 8 hours of sleep is non negotiable.

Put your alarm across the room. Make getting up a physical requirement. Once you’re standing, don’t get back in bed no matter what.

Have a structured morning routine ready. Don’t wake up early and then waste the time scrolling. I used the plan Reload built which gave me immediate things to do and blocked distractions.

Make it non negotiable. No snooze, no exceptions, no “just this once.” The alarm goes off, you get up. Every single day including weekends.

Use the morning time for yourself. Not email, not work obligations, things that matter to you. Work out, read, learn, build. Make it worth waking up for.

Track every single day. I used Reload’s tracking to check off each morning. Seeing that streak grow motivated me not to break it.

Give it 60 days minimum. Week one is misery. Week two your body starts adapting. By week four it feels natural. By week eight you can’t imagine sleeping until 11 anymore.

-----

## Final thoughts

60 days ago I was waking up at 11am, wasting half my day sleeping, always feeling behind and unproductive. I’d convinced myself I wasn’t a morning person.

Now I wake at 5am every day, get more done by 9am than I used to all day, have time for everything I always wanted to do, and feel in control of my life.

Two months of waking at 5am completely transformed my productivity, discipline, and how I see myself.

You’re not “not a morning person.” You’ve just never actually tried to be one. It’s a habit, not a personality trait. And habits change.

Wake at 5am for 60 days. Go to bed at 9pm. Put your alarm across the room. Build a morning routine. Don’t snooze. See what happens when you reclaim those morning hours.

The version of you that wakes at 5am accomplishes more, has more time, and has more control than the version that sleeps until 11.

Start tomorrow. Set your alarm for 5am tonight. When it goes off, stand up. Don’t think, just move.

Wishing you all a Happy New Year.



I am in need of advice but also perspective.



My wife and I have been married for 21 years, we have two kids (8 and 13) and own our own home.

Over the last 12-15 months I felt something was not right between us but I dismissed it.  It felt like we were still close and though we had busy lives with work and kids, we still had some intimacy.   Some things I dismissed were :

\- wife would stop leaving her phone on the desk or on charge, it was always in her pocket or out of sight.

\- wife would often stay up till midnight then tell me she was watching a new box set or a film.

\- when I would text her during these times she was up late, I often wouldn't receive a reply, it felt odd but not so much that made me doubt her.

The above things were just some of the things I dismissed which I wish, now, I had spoken to her about.  I think it feels like had I spoke to her then this wouldn't have happened.  I trusted her explicitly and never doubted anything she told me.

In 2024 I suffered from psoriasis and was eventually put on some strong medication but thankfully no side effects.  In addition to this, I went for a health check and my tiredness was related to sleep apnea, for which I use a cpap machine at night.

So during the afternoon of 31st December 2025 my wife mentioned that she was talking to some people online,  we spoke briefly about it and then just carried on with getting ready to celebrate the new year.  My wife works full time and she has always been a member of forums for work place practises, legel issues relating to employment law and often talks to people from different areas around the UK.  I didnt think much of it.

Later that day I was out with the kids getting some last minute shopping items.

My wife had been texting me and then mentioned she was on line talking to her new friends.  I asked which ones and she said the one she met about 3 weeks ago.

I felt a little confused because earlier in the day she said it had only been a week.  I didnt say anything else about it and said we would be home shortly.

The kids tried to stay up till midnight but were in bed by 10pm.

My wife and I then just chilled on the sofa and just had general chit chat.  I then asked how long she had been online with her new friends and she said 3 weeks.  Thats when things changed.  And for the following 3 days I was drip fed information.  For 3 days I hardly slept, cried a lot and couldnt eat or drink.  We both did our best to make sure the kids didnt notice what was going on.

From new years eve up until the 4th January what started as ""I've been chatting to some people on line"" turned into my wife telling me that for the past year she had been on a chat site and used messaging apps to talk to about 8 guys online where she would text them and on occasions was involved in sexual messages, including phone sex, video chat and exchanging voice notes. 

This totally broke me, even now, I am devoid of any feelings, I've lost weight and have only been able to sleep through the night last night.  It was the best sleep but when I woke up, it felt like I had entered a nightmare.

We spent a lot of time talking, in fact I dont think we had spoke  like this in years.

She told me how she felt lonely and needed to feel wanted but felt she couldn't speak to me.

I discovered that there were times she would share intimacy on a call whilst I was putting the kids to bed or having a shower and then she would be intimate with me.

I just felt so confused and told her there were times I felt alone and had no one to talk to but I didnt feel the need to then betray her.  Over time her answers were ""I cant remember"" or "" I dont rememeber"".  I told her how when I was being treated for psoriasis, I hated it, the hospital tried so many different treatments and nothing worked but at those low points I never confided or went to someone one else for attention.

Those initially 3 days consisted of my wife telling me stuff and I had this gut feeling she wasn't being honest.  Rightly or wrongly, I kept pushing for information when I had that gut feeling.  Looking back, im glad I did push for information, had I let it just go then I would have been none the wiser.

I feel heart broken, ive never experienced this kind of pain ever in my life.

We decided to try marriage counciling and I told her it would only work if we can be truthful to each other.  We have agreed to do an inital session of counciling seperately and depending on that, we may do some sessions together.

Even after 4-5 days I was still asking questions and each time she was giving snippets of information, it felt like I had to ask the right questions to get an answer.  This is despite telling her there was  nothing more she could say/describe/tell me because my heart had been ripped out and I was devoid of all feelings.

She assured me it was all online via app or chat rooms.  Then I asked her about her last interaction and she told me that she had discussed meeting up with this guy in late January 2026 for a coffee but didnt think she could have gone through with it.  I asked her are you only saying that because you have been caught, she replied it was not sexual all the time.  I then asked if she had spoke  to anyone about our summer holidays, she eventually told me that she told the last guy we were going Spain in August and it would have been interesting if he was there as well.  But then tells me she would never have gone and done it because that would have been disrespectful to me and the kids.

My head was in overtime, I asked if she had been in contact with other guys when we went on holiday I  August 2025, she said yes, but the reception was bad in spain and the WiFi was unreliable.   I just couldn't believe her answer. 

I asked her if she had betrayed me, been deceptive since the day we got married, she said no, it had only been the last 12-13months.

During those first few days, I signed up to the chat rooms she used and installed apps that she used.  I wanted to feel what she felt so m7ch so that I even paid for memberships.  I didnt or couldn't feel what I thought she felt.  I told my wife what I had done and said I just dont get it.  at all times you have been in control, no one has forced you to do this.  We could have spoken about this or even got a councilor involved, but I don't get why she chose this option, maybe I never will.

My last question about what she had done was 13th January 2026.  The context is as follows:  about a month ago, I had to attend A&E with one of my kids because they were wheezing and it took a lot of effort for them to breath.  We were in A&E from 8pm till 1am.  My child had a chest infection and was discharged with antibiotics.

So I asked her, on that day, did you use chat or messages, and did she communicate with anyone.  She said, no I was worried about you guys, im not that heartless.  After she said that, my gut was in a knot.  Something told me she was not being truthful.  After the kids went to bed, I asked her again and said whatever she told me, couldn't hurt me and that there was nothing in me that she could damage any more.

She then said she may have gone on to a messaging app but couldn't recall.  I reminded her that the kids have not been to hospital in over 4 years so why couldn't she recall what happened on that day considering it was such a significant day.  It took some time but I just sat there and looked at her.  She eventually  told me that she had been checking the messaging app and she may have chatted to someone but it would have just chatting and nothing sexual.  I said that I didnt care if it was sexual or not, it was about our kid being in hospital and she took the opportunity to engage with someone else.

I asked what she was thinking at the time, considering our kid was in A&E.  She replied she didnt know what she was thinking and now felt she had caused so much damage in our marriage.

Its been intense, we have done our best to ensure the kids are not aware of whats happening so we still sleep in the same room.  We still go out shopping as a family and try to keep everything stable.

I dont want to lose her but I feel like I cannot trust her but I still love her deeply.  Maybe the trust will come back over time.  Initially I felt disgust everytime I looked at her and felt overwhelmed when the kids were there.  Now I dont really feel a lot but there are two strong feelings within:

Firstly I want this to work and I am committed to giving 100% because to throw away 21 years of marriage and the effect on our kids makes me feel sick.  My wife feels the same.

Secondly, I have this feeling that she is still withholding something from me, even though she has said there is nothing else. I will have to find a way to manage that or accept the feeling and maybe counciling will help.

I need your prospective and advice?  Please just tell me how it is, I dont think anyone could say anything to me that would shock or surprise me.



I will reply to any further questions as soon as I can

Our aim should be to focus more on getting the fundamentals right about coffee-making, slowly leveling up skills and then equipment, and thus progressing fruitfully in our coffee journey. I found this video that explains quite well how just emptying your wallet or getting hyper focused on the latest and greatest machines and grinders and accessories won’t make your coffee-making experience any better, but could actually hamper it. 

So, my recommendation is to be patient, improve your skills, then inprove your equipment. Focus more on improving the quality of your coffee and the water you use rather than the equipment always, and remember that the more expensive equipment you buy, the more diminished the returns get. I thought this video would be a great honest guide for all the beginners, and even some of the intermediates and ‘pros’ here. 

Not affiliated with the channel or anything, just found it to be a good resource. I know that this is a lot of unsolicited advice, but I feel it is worth it if it helps even one of you not empty your pockets. 

When I started my espresso journey, I was a student, so I didn’t have money to level up my equipment as fast, and I guess this helped me learn and practice with what I had, before I could upgrade incrementally, based on what I needed. I didn’t even get a decent burr grinder until I was already 3 years into making espresso 😂",3,1768496024.0,IndiaCoffee,0,0.8,False

## Thematic Analysis

### Semiconductor Rally on TSMC Blowout (8 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Strongly Bullish

  * **Key Headlines:**

    * TSMC Q4 profit jumps 35% to record, beats expectations
    * ASML tops $500 billion market cap as TSMC results ignite semis rally
    * Wall Street opens higher as chip stocks shine; chip equipment stocks soar
    * European chip stocks rally after TSMC blowout earnings
    * U.S.-listed TSMC shares climb 5% after profit surges on soaring AI demand
    * Wells Fargo upgrades key chip names; AMD a top pick
    * Morgan Stanley upgrades KLA on foundry logic focus
    * RBC launches semiconductor coverage, urges selective exposure as AI momentum cools
  * **Analysis:** TSMC's record quarterly profit and 35% year-over-year surge validates the AI infrastructure narrative that temporarily wobbled after Oracle's disappointing results earlier this month. The foundry leader's bullish forecast and plans for additional US factory investments demonstrate sustained confidence in multi-year AI data center buildout, directly benefiting equipment makers (ASML crossing $500B market cap, KLA upgrades) and chip designers (AMD becoming top pick). The breadth of the rally—spanning European and US markets, fabless designers, foundries, and equipment suppliers—suggests institutional conviction that AI capex cycle has years to run. ASML's milestone valuation underscores how equipment suppliers capture value from both AI buildout and broader semiconductor industry growth.

  * **Contrarian View:** RBC's launch coverage with ""selective exposure"" recommendation acknowledges risks of stretched valuations and potential AI spending moderation, suggesting not all semiconductor names equally positioned.

  * **Implication:** TSMC results provide fundamental validation for high semiconductor valuations, but selectivity matters as AI spending eventually normalizes.




### M&A Deal Wave (6 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bullish

  * **Key Headlines:**

    * Boston Scientific beefs up heart device portfolio with $14.5 billion Penumbra deal
    * Keurig Dr Pepper launches $18 billion takeover bid for JDE Peet's
    * Fresh Del Monte wins bid to acquire Del Monte Foods for $285 million
    * Talen Energy stock rises after $3.45 billion acquisition of gas plants
    * ClassPass-owner Playlist, EGYM to merge in deal backed by Jared Kushner's firm
    * CK Hutchison seeks $30 billion valuation for A.S. Watson dual listing
  * **Analysis:** Over $35 billion in announced M&A activity within 12 hours demonstrates robust corporate dealmaking appetite despite 5%+ borrowing costs. The Boston Scientific/Penumbra $14.5B medical device megadeal and Keurig's $18B coffee consolidation represent strategic bets on defensive, cash-generative sectors rather than speculative growth plays. Deal premiums (Penumbra surging on news) signal acquirers willing to pay up for strategic fit and market leadership positions. The breadth across sectors—healthcare devices, consumer staples, energy infrastructure, fitness tech—suggests M&A market functioning normally with both strategic buyers and private equity active. CK Hutchison's $30B retail unit IPO filing adds to capital markets activity, indicating investor appetite for large offerings.

  * **Implication:** Deal activity at this scale and pace contradicts recession fears and validates corporate confidence in growth visibility and financing availability.




### Geopolitical Risk Moderation (4 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bullish (near-term) with Bearish undercurrent (structural risks)

  * **Key Headlines:**

    * U.S. stocks rise after solid bank earnings; Iran tensions ease
    * Maersk ramps up sailings via Suez Canal and Red Sea; shipping companies plan return
    * European airlines continue to avoid Iran and Iraq despite airspace reopening
    * European military heads to Greenland as Trump's ambitions undeterred; Fitch warns NATO tensions could trigger Eastern European downgrades
  * **Analysis:** Iran/Red Sea tensions moderating enough for major shipping lines (Maersk) to resume Suez Canal routes represents significant de-escalation from recent months, potentially reducing freight costs and supply chain pressures that have contributed to inflation persistence. However, airlines' continued avoidance of Iran/Iraq airspace despite reopening suggests cautious risk assessment. Meanwhile, escalating US-Europe tensions over Greenland introduce new geopolitical uncertainty, with Fitch explicitly warning that NATO fracture could trigger sovereign downgrades across Eastern Europe—a structural risk that could reshape defense spending, currency stability, and regional security architecture.

  * **Implication:** Near-term trade route normalization is constructive for inflation and supply chains, but Greenland tensions create medium-term alliance instability risk.




### Fed Independence & Regulatory Concerns (5 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bearish for policy credibility

  * **Key Headlines:**

    * Erosion of Fed independence would be 'credit negative' for US rating, Fitch warns
    * Coinbase CEO opposes major US crypto bill, clouding regulatory outlook
    * US Senate Banking delays crypto bill after Coinbase CEO opposition
    * India warns Apple it will proceed with antitrust case after company plays for time
    * Microsoft faces Swiss antitrust probe over licensing fees
  * **Analysis:** Fitch's explicit warning that Fed independence erosion would threaten US sovereign credit rating elevates political pressure on monetary policy from background noise to material risk. The statement comes amid ongoing criticism of Trump Fed picks lacking independence, suggesting rating agencies monitoring situation closely. Separately, regulatory environment remains challenging with Coinbase fracturing crypto industry consensus on legislation, India pressing Apple antitrust case, and Microsoft facing Swiss licensing probe—all demonstrating that big tech regulatory scrutiny intensifying globally rather than easing.

  * **Implication:** Fed credibility questions introduce risk premium to Treasuries and dollar; tech regulatory environment remains structural headwind.




### AI Infrastructure Investments Continue (4 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bullish

  * **Key Headlines:**

    * Amazon announces AWS European Sovereign Cloud, plans €7.8 billion investment
    * OpenAI signs $10 billion computing deal with Nvidia challenger Cerebras
    * Wikipedia owner signs on Microsoft, Meta in AI content training deals
    * Bernstein names winners and losers in the AI driven data explosion
  * **Analysis:** Amazon's €7.8B European sovereign cloud investment and OpenAI's $10B Cerebras compute contract demonstrate hyperscalers maintaining aggressive AI infrastructure buildout despite questions about monetization timing. Amazon's data sovereignty focus addresses regulatory barriers to European public sector adoption, potentially unlocking significant new revenue streams. OpenAI's diversification beyond Nvidia to Cerebras signals competitive intensity in AI accelerator market and validates emerging chip architectures. Content licensing deals (Wikipedia with Microsoft/Meta) create new business models for training data providers.

  * **Implication:** AI infrastructure spending cycle robust with both capex (data centers) and opex (content licensing, compute contracts) growing, supporting semiconductor and cloud infrastructure valuations.




### Corporate Restructuring & Cost Pressures (4 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bearish for affected companies, neutral for market

  * **Key Headlines:**

    * Wells Fargo misses profit estimates on severance costs, shares fall
    * Ericsson plans to cut 1,600 jobs in Sweden (duplicate coverage)
    * European corporates expected to deliver worst earnings growth in past seven quarters
    * US farm economy shows widening cracks as costs rise, jobs vanish
  * **Analysis:** Wells Fargo's earnings miss on higher-than-expected severance charges and Ericsson's 1,600 job cuts highlight ongoing cost pressures forcing corporate restructuring despite relatively healthy economy. European corporate earnings outlook at seven-quarter low suggests region facing more challenging environment than US. Farm economy deterioration with rising costs and job losses indicates rural economic stress spreading, potentially with political implications.

  * **Implication:** Cost management remains priority even for profitable companies; Europe facing growth challenges; agricultural sector weakness bears monitoring.




* * *

## Market Implications

TSMC's blowout earnings and robust outlook provide the fundamental validation semiconductor bulls needed after Oracle's disappointing results temporarily clouded the AI infrastructure thesis. The foundry leader's 35% profit surge, record revenue, and plans for additional US factories demonstrate that hyperscale AI spending remains robust and conversion from capital expenditure to foundry revenue is accelerating. This directly addresses the ""timing mismatch"" concern raised by Oracle's elevated AI capex relative to revenue growth. The resulting semiconductor rally—ASML crossing $500 billion market cap, broad-based analyst upgrades across AMD, KLA, and others—suggests institutional investors view current valuations as justified by multi-year demand visibility. However, RBC's cautious ""selective exposure"" recommendation acknowledges that not all semiconductor names are equally positioned for sustained growth, and valuations have become extended for companies without clear AI exposure.

The surge in M&A activity—over $35 billion announced in 12 hours spanning healthcare devices ($14.5B), consumer staples ($18B), and energy infrastructure ($3.5B)—contradicts recession fears and demonstrates corporate confidence in growth visibility. Boston Scientific paying a substantial premium for Penumbra and Keurig pursuing JDE Peet's despite 5%+ borrowing costs signals strategic buyers believe current valuations represent attractive entry points relative to long-term synergies. The deals concentrate in defensive, cash-generative sectors rather than speculative growth, suggesting acquirers prioritizing quality and market leadership over financial engineering. This active M&A environment, combined with CK Hutchison's $30B retail unit IPO filing and successful capital raises, indicates capital markets functioning normally and investor appetite for large transactions intact.

Geopolitical developments present a mixed picture: near-term de-escalation of Iran/Red Sea tensions and Maersk's resumed Suez Canal sailings should reduce freight costs and ease supply chain pressures that have contributed to inflation persistence. However, escalating US-Europe tensions over Greenland introduce a new and potentially more consequential risk, with Fitch explicitly warning that NATO fracture could trigger sovereign downgrades across Eastern Europe. This would reshape defense spending priorities, currency stability, and regional security architecture in ways that could prove more disruptive than transient Middle East tensions. Meanwhile, Fitch's warning about Fed independence erosion threatening US credit rating elevates political pressure on monetary policy from background noise to material risk, potentially introducing a risk premium to Treasuries and the dollar if market perceives Fed losing data-driven credibility.

Thank you all for your responses. I definitely have no desire to make someone uncomfortable at their workplace and exactly why I posted this to ask.

I was at a bar while my daughter was at dance class next door. I was the only one sitting at the bar, so the bartender may have just been friendly, but our conversations felt genuinely thoughtful and engaged. At one point, I made a self-deprecating joke that took her a moment to register—I caught her quietly cracking up once it clicked while she was entering an order.

When I asked if the music was her playlist, she seemed genuinely surprised I knew several of the artists. We talked about music, my 90s references, and travel. Her questions felt curiously personal for small talk. When I left, she was taking an order at a table behind me. I motioned goodbye, but she didn't see me. As I opened the door, she interrupted herself mid-order to say goodbye.

I'm probably reading too much into it, but I felt something between us... an energy. It wasn't flirty or anything like that, but we seemed to connect. I was never good at picking up on cues when I was single 20 years ago. But I'm wondering: is this enough to return and give her my number for coffee sometime, or should I assume she was just being friendly and doing her job?

Since being single again, I'm actively trying to push myself into the uncomfortable situations I always avoided when I was younger—building confidence, knowing I'll face rejection. I just don't want to overstep by hitting on someone who may simply be working.

### Injecting Environment and Crowd Behavior

**Reliability: ★★★★☆ High**

### What This Trick Actually Does

This trick uses **environmental cues inside the lyrics** to bias Suno toward:
- Live recordings
- Audience noise
- Imperfect timing
- Raw vocal delivery

You are NOT ""adding sound effects.""  
You are **changing the performance context**.

---

### Why This Works

Suno associates certain textual patterns with:
- Concert recordings
- Live performances
- Crowd interaction

When it sees those cues, it shifts:
- **Vocal polish** — decreases (more raw)
- **Timing** — becomes looser
- **Ambience** — adds space and noise

---

### Syntax Reference

**Section tags** set the context:
```
[Intro: Live Crowd Cheering]
[Stage Ambience]
[Outro: Applause, Crowd Going Wild]
```

**Asterisks** add non-sung sound events:
```
*crowd roaring*
*audience cheering*
*applause*
```

The asterisks tell Suno: ""This is not to be sung.""

---

### Sound Effects Reference (Asterisk Syntax)

#### Live Atmospheres
| Syntax | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `*crowd cheering*` | Applause and screams |
| `*audience singalong*` | Crowd singing along |
| `*festival roar*` | Stadium/festival roar |
| `*applause*` | Final applause |

#### Dramatic Effects
| Syntax | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `*thunder*` | Thunder for epic moments |
| `*gunshots*` | For rap/trap/metal |
| `*explosion*` | For EDM drops |
| `*glass breaking*` | Breaking glass |

#### Environments
| Syntax | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `*café ambience*` | Coffee shop chatter |
| `*rain falling*` | Melancholic atmosphere |
| `*wind howling*` | Isolated, cold feeling |

#### Narrative
| Syntax | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `*phone ringing*` | Phone ring |
| `*door slamming*` | Door slam |
| `*footsteps*` | Footsteps |
| `*heartbeat*` | Heartbeat pulse |

---

### One Real Prompt (Copy / Paste)

**Lyrics:**
```
[Intro: Live Crowd Cheering]
[Stage Ambience]

*crowd noise building*

Are you ready tonight?!

*crowd roaring*

We came here to rock!
We came here to feel alive!

*audience cheering*

[Chorus]
This is where I belong!
Singing with you all night long!

*crowd singalong*

[Outro: Applause, Crowd Going Wild]
```

**Style:**
```
Live concert recording, raw rock energy, 
festival atmosphere, audience interaction, 
stadium rock sound, powerful male vocals, 
imperfect timing, authentic live feel, 
mid-tempo (115-125 BPM), anthemic chorus, 
crowd participation, sweaty and real
```

---

### When This Fails

This trick fails when:
- ❌ Used with highly polished genres (clean pop, EDM)
- ❌ Combined with ""clean / studio / pristine"" keywords
- ❌ Overused (too many sound effect cues)
- ❌ Cues contradict the style prompt

**What happens when it fails:** Results sound confused—half studio, half live—or Suno ignores the cues entirely.

---

### Iteration Advice

- **Less is more** — one or two live cues are enough
- **Match genre** — live cues work best with rock, folk, singer-songwriter
- **Place cues at structural moments** — intro, between sections, outro
- **Don't expect precise sound effects** — think ""atmosphere,"" not ""specific sound""

Influencers shout about crazy detox diets like it’s the 2000s again. The problem? Most of this stuff is pure nonsense. It’s not your lack of willpower. It’s that you’ve been lied to by people chasing views not science.  

So what is legit when it comes to burning belly fat? After going down multiple rabbit holes of podcasts scientific studies and expert interviews one name kept coming up: Dr. Mindy Pelz. Her approach is getting a lot of attention for one key reason   it’s not centered around caloriecutting or endless cardio.  

This post breaks down what actually works based on the best science out there   and it’s way simpler than you think.The REAL belly fat secret isn’t a supplement or a workout program   it’s insulin sensitivity. That’s what Dr. Mindy Pelz explains over and over in her lectures and book Fast Like a Girl. She’s part of a growing group of researchers and practitioners showing how timing your food may matter more than what you eat.

Here’s the breakdown:

 TimeRestricted Eating (TRE)  
The basic idea: Eat within an 8hour window fast for 16 hours.Why it works: When you're not spiking insulin constantly your body dips into stored fat. Especially belly fat. A 2020 review in the New England Journal of Medicine found intermittent fasting improved fat oxidation insulin sensitivity and reduced visceral fat.  Dr. Satchin Panda from the Salk Institute showed that even without changing food intake eating within a set window resulted in weight loss and reduced inflammation. Pelz suggests varying fast lengths (sometimes 24hour fasts) to push metabolic flexibility further.
  
 Stop snacking all day Why it matters: Every time you eat insulin rises. Constant grazing keeps your body in fatstorage mode. In Metabolical Dr. Robert Lustig explains how frequent eating and processed carbs increase visceral fat through insulin resistance.  Instead aim for 23 meals no snacks. Give your body time to use fat instead of just storing it.
  
 Focus on metabolic flexibility not calorie burning  It's not just about keto or lowcarb. It's about teaching your body to switch fuel sources easily.   Dr. Mindy emphasizes metabolic switching   training your body to burn sugar and fat. This happens when you combine fasting strength training and nutrient cycling.  A 2019 NIH study led by Dr. Mark Mattson shows how metabolic switching enhances gene expression related to longevity and fat loss.

Other underrated belly fat killers (backed by real science):

 Walk after meals  
Why it works: A 15minute walk postdinner can significantly lower blood sugar spikes according to a study in Diabetes Care.  Helps reduce insulin improves digestion and signals the body to use glucose instead of storing it.

 Lift heavy at least twice a week  
Muscle is your fatburning tissue.   A 2021 study from Harvard confirmed strength training is directly linked to lower visceral fat even without weight loss.  Combine this with fasting and the results multiply.

 Prioritize sleep (seriously)  
Less than 6 hours of sleep = 55% less fat loss even if you eat the same. This stat comes from a University of Chicago study where both groups ate the same diet but the sleep-deprived group lost muscle not fat.  Dr. Andrew Huberman also highlights on his podcast how poor sleep disrupts cortisol and insulin, both belly fat generators.

If you're stuck chasing flat tummy teas or starving on 1200 calories stop. Belly fat is hormonal. You can't outcrunch it. You have to teach your body to access stored energy and regulate insulin. That means eating smarter less often and giving your body time to rest and repair.

The good news? This isn’t about perfection. You don’t need to fast every day or give up carbs forever. But once you understand how your body actually stores and burns fat you stop fighting it. Most people are one or two habits away from unlocking real change   and it doesn’t involve suffering.

Start with these:

 Push your first meal later by 23 hours  
 Eat your last meal before 7pm  
 Walk after dinner  
 Lift heavy twice a week  
 Sleep 7+ hours  
 Ditch snacks and drink water/black coffee between meals

Once you stop feeding the fat storage machine results come faster than you think.

It is called “Fish Bait Studios “ because it was a setting in one of my books “Coffee and Cash”. Thanks to some friends at fiver I created a song and the music video that had a relationship to the book and the setting push beat studios in the book and I was using YouTube to promote it. Then I try to use nature and music that I created myself and borrowed from other people as a shared and when that failed, I tried different things like giving financial advice and life advice, and when that didn’t gain any attraction, I finally did whatever I want, but now I’m creating this little animated bear, which I really like and I keep on thinking of stories, but now all my content is pretty much a mess and a mishmash of everything and I don’t know if I should do anything about that or if I should just leave everything the way it isI can’t decide on what direction to take",1,1768495161.0,YouTubeCreators,0,1.0,False

Let me introduce you to as close as we can get you to true human connection via technology without you being the product. [www.ZeroTrace.world](http://www.ZeroTrace.world)

This has been my passion project to offer a zero account required, zero app needed, zero payment up front, zero ads, zero analytics, zero Ai.... (are you getting the picture?) Peer to Peer Voice/Video/Text/File Transfer system for those who need it.

After the initial logic load and handshake - it's decentralized edge after - that's why you will find the video and audio so good... no processing server in the middle.

If you are watching what is going on out there - you know why this exists!

You are NOT the product.

I repeat: YOU ARE NOT THE PRODUCT!

Please consider buying us a coffee to support those who can't - your name will be added to the supporter page only if you put your name/alias in the optional field - but there is no obligation - we are not looking to dox anyone.

I am out to prove relational value - not extractive value - can drive a product and I will be converting every product - even WorldCAST to a pay what you want/can model.

You would be surprised at what people can and will support you with if you treat them with dignity and understanding. 

I believe in this to my very core.

Some won't - but many will. 

Support this to support others!

For context, I work full time at an overall pretty good cafe, not overwhelmingly busy but not a dead zone, I love specialty coffee and I get paid more or less fairly, and my coworkers and management are great. It is in a gentrifying area so there's a big mix of a lot of poverty/homelessness/drug addiction that I have to manage on a daily basis (which I'm not paid nearly enough to be doing, but I'm a human being so I do it), along with very rude entitled wealthy folks who are largely the only people who can afford to come here daily. Handling these sorts of interactions, along with your regular barista complaints of vacant stares, rude customers, bad tips, and general lack of social awareness from customers, I've gotten to a point where in my time off, I have no emotional or social capacity left and it's taking a huge toll on my personal life. I forget to call my parents, I rarely see friends, I answer emails/letters/cards (old school lol, I know) after weeks of putting it off, I never want to go out anymore... I barely even have it in me to carry on conversations with my coworkers, and I haven't made new friends in ages. It feels awful, and people definitely notice, but no matter how hard I try i feel like I'm always playing catch-up in my social life, then getting burnt out again. I plan on quitting this summer before I go back to college, but until then, I have no clue how I'm supposed to handle this. Does anyone experience this too or have advice?",4,1768494862.0,barista,4,1.0,False
