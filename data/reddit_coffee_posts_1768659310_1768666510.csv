My husband run a company with his two partners. They did some illegal things and he was arrested few months ago and it seems he will be locked up for a few years. I knew what they were doing. I wasn't exactly on board with it, but I didn't stop him either, although I warned him a hunder times that their greed will land them in prison and it did. I'm not going to defend him, he got what he deserved but he is still my husband and I love him. 

However, my mother, who used to praise him for being a good husband, a good father and a successful man thinks I should divorce him because he ruined our family's reputation. Mind you, she is very conservative woman and doesn't believe in divorce. She thinks that in my case it would be acceptable to divorce him legally but, since we are married in Catholic Church and she strictly obeys Church's rules, I should remain celibate for the rest of my (or his) life. I do not want to divorce him but if I were to do it under any circumstances I surely wouldn't stay alone for the rest of my life. 

  
Anyway, about a month and half ago, she decided to come to stay in my house to help me with children. At least she said so. But, ever since she has moved in she has been criticising me 24/7. She keeps pushing me to divorce my husband and makes mean comments about how I raise my children, even in front of them. She keeps complaning about the fact that I have hired a nanny for my children, saying she didn't need any help despite of being a mother of four and a widow (my father died in a car crash when I was 8). While it is true, it is not the same, as she is a piano teacher and gave lessons in our living room while I'm in IT and work every day from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. She also doesn't like that I leave my children with nanny to go for coffee or drinks with my friends, foood I cook is not healthy enough, children are not religious enough (although I take them to church every Sunday). 

  
I tried to gently let her know that I would like her to leave my house. I asked her few times when is she planning on going home but she says that children like to have her around and I am too busy so I could use some help and it is better that children are with their grandma instead with some stranger (their nanny is super sweet and they adore her, but that doesn't matter to my mum). 

  
So, I came up with a plan. My mother is on horrible terms with my sister (40F). My sister met her current fiancé through work when she was still married to her ex husband. They fell for each other and started an affair. My sister came clean soon to her then-husband and they got divorced. While he was understandbly hurt, their divorce was rather peaceful. However, my mother never accepted it, she says that my sister will always be married to her ex husband in God's eyes. They fight often and my mother refuses to even speak to my future BIL. Sis and future BIL live in neighbour country, they moved their for business opportunities so I don't see them as much as I used to. I do miss my sister and I love it when she has some time off so she comes to stay with me. However, this time I called her to save me from our mother. She gladly agreed and they came to visit. My mother was so offended that I invited ""that adultress and her lover"" but she didn't want to leave. However, few days later, I came home from work and my mum and my sister are having a rather fierce fight. Mum is calling my sister names, my sister is swearing... Anyway, after I came in, mum asked me to choose between two of them. I told her that the righ choice is always the person who doesn't ask to be chosen. She was furious, she packed her things and finally went home. So, everything worked out as I planned. But, I am feeling guilty. She is judgmental and controlling, but she is still my mother, she did her best to raise me, my sister and our brothers, especially after dad's death, and maybe I should have been more gentle or honest. What do you think, people, am I wrong?",1,1768666328.0,amiwrong,0,1.0,False

I finally stopped overthinking and shipped my little side project, Caffeine Curfew.

It’s basically a tool for those of us who turn coffee into code but forget that drinking a double shot at 5 PM means staring at the ceiling until 2 AM.

I just checked the first week's stats and I'm kinda floored! 

421 Downloads, 165 in revenue to get more coffee, and a 24.2 conversion rate. 

I usually see like 2-3% on my other projects. Maybe I just tapped into the universal developer struggle of needing sleep? Lmao. 

Anyway, I’d love for you guys to roast the UI or tell me if the features actually make sense. I’m trying to figure out if this is beginner's luck or if I should actually double down on this. It has a free Apple Watch app, Home Screen widgets, Apple health integration, and more!

What I liked most:

* ❄️ **Keeps drinks cold for a full workday** (still cold after 10–12 hours)
* 🔥 Also works well for hot drinks (coffee/tea stays warm for hours)
* 💧 **Straw lid + spout lid** included — useful depending on situation
* 🚫 **No leaks** in my backpack so far
* 🏋️ Wide mouth makes it easy to add ice

I used to refill smaller bottles multiple times a day, but with 40 oz, I just focus on work instead of constantly refilling.

Not saying it’s the *best* bottle ever, but for sports, office, or daily hydration, it’s been very solid so far.

Kelly curled against his side, head on his chest, leg draped over his hip. Titus’s arm wrapped around her, fingers tracing lazy patterns on her back.

Their data pads pinged in unison.

Kelly groaned softly, reaching for hers. Titus grabbed his.

The message was from Edward:

We are heading to mess hall. Would appreciate you and Kelly coming to meet us. – E

  Titus read it aloud. “He says we need to get dressed. Edward wants us in the mess hall.”

Kelly lifted her head, hair mussed. “Them? Who’s ‘them’?”

Titus shrugged. “That’s all it says.”

Kelly sat up, stretching. “Send him back: ‘On our way. 20 minutes.’”

Titus typed quickly, hit send.

They dressed—slowly, trading soft touches and quiet laughter. Titus pulled on his clothes while Kelly threw on shorts, a loose tee, and flat sneakers, finger-combing her hair. She leaned in close, stuck her tongue in his ear playfully—yuk—making him laugh and swat at her.

They headed out hand in hand, the corridors quiet. Kelly’s thumb brushed slow circles over his knuckles as they walked.

They reached the mess hall with five minutes to spare.

The smell hit them—grilled protein, roasted vegetables, fresh bread. Kelly filled a tray with two plates of food—strips, rice, greens, bread—while Titus grabbed water bottles. They scanned the chit together.

Then they saw the table.

Edward was there, in his usual spot near the viewport. Director Hale sat across from him. Joana Taylor—logistics chief—sat to Hale’s right. Cathy sat beside Edward.

All four turned as they approached. Edward’s expression shifted to amused resignation. Hale’s mouth twitched. Joana raised an eyebrow, small smile playing at her lips.

Kelly put her free hand up in mock surrender. “It’s all his fault for coming here.”

Cathy snorted. “Sure it is.”

Titus set the tray down carefully across from Hale. Kelly slid into the seat beside Edward; Titus sat next to her, close enough that their thighs touched under the table.

Hale leaned back, eyeing them both. “Glad you could both make it. Titus—you just finish that workout?”

Kelly’s smile was pure mischief. “Uncle Hale, he sure did. One hour on the track, one hour in the gym… and then another two hours.” She looked him directly in the eye. “And it was a hard two hours.”

Edward barked a laugh. “Spare us the details.”

Hale’s face flushed crimson. He shook his head, chuckling. “You two are incorrigible.”

At that moment, Kelly asked, “So what’s going on?”

Cathy caught her look and winked. “I got here early. Wanted to see the show.”

The table erupted in easy laughter.

Hale raised his coffee mug in a mock toast. “To young love. And to not being late tomorrow.”

They all clinked—mugs, water bottles, whatever was at hand.

The conversation started easily enough.

Cathy leaned forward, eyes sparkling. “So… have your parents met Titus yet?”

Kelly blushed—deep, instant. “Not… officially. I mean, Mom knows I’m seeing someone. But not details.”

Cathy grinned. “I sent her a pic of him.” Cathy “Your mom says his face looks familiar” . 

Joana “ thinking he does but I don’t remember Vickey showing me a picture “ 

The table laughed—warm, fond. Titus looked startled, cheeks pink.

“Seriously?” he asked.

Cathy shrugged. “She asked. I delivered.”

While they started eating, Joana leaned toward Hale winking . “Director, I need a flight to the asteroid processing plant. Late run tomorrow evening. Supplies—new coil housings, diagnostic gear. Overnight stay.”

Hale nodded slowly. “I know the run. Edward’s territory.”

Edward’s eyes narrowed slightly. “Yeah. It’s my run.”

Joana looked at him with a smile. “I could send Titus and Kelly. Titus flew it clean, right Director?”

The table went quiet.

Everyone knew what that meant. The plant. Kate Adams. History.

Hale leaned forward, voice casual. “If Titus is ready to left-seat it, I could send him and Kelly.”

Edward started laughing—short, surprised, genuine. “Seriously?”

Hale shrugged. “Maybe tomorrow evening. Late run. Most likely an overnight stay.” He paused, then added with perfect deadpan delivery: “Winking at Edward.”

The table dissolved into laughter again.

Edward shook his head, grinning wide. “Yeah, heck no. That’s my run. I’ll let the kid left-seat it—if you send these two—” he pointed at Kelly and Titus—“there’ll be a litter of babies on the station in nine months.”

Everyone laughed—loud, warm, the kind of laughter that came from years of shared shifts and shared secrets.

Kelly rolled her eyes, but her cheeks were pink. “Thanks, Uncle Edward.”

Cathy pointed at her. “Gives you and me time to catch up on some details.”

Joana watched the exchange with quiet amusement, then leaned toward Hale. “So… Titus. Your mom’s Vicky Staples, right?”

Cathy started to speak . 

Cathy,” Joana said, voice calm but amused, “there will be plenty of time for details. You and Kelly are taking the second shuttle tomorrow evening.”

Cathy’s head snapped toward Joana so fast she nearly spilled her coffee. “Wait—what?”

Joana shrugged, setting her mug down with a soft clink. “Director Hale approved it. Late run to the asteroid processing plant. Supplies, diagnostics, overnight stay. Kelly’s left seat, you’re right seat. Titus and Edward are on the first bird. Two shuttles. Two crews. Plenty of time for… catching up.”

Kelly’s eyes widened. She looked at Cathy, then back at Joana, then at Cathy again.

Cathy blinked. “You’re serious.”

“Dead serious,” Joana replied, her smile turning just a little wicked. “You two will have the whole overnight to compare notes. Or… whatever else you want to do with the time.”

Cathy let out a slow, delighted laugh, leaning back in her chair. “Oh my God. Uncle Hale is playing matchmaker and wingman. I love him.”

Kelly’s cheeks flushed darker, but she was grinning now—wide, giddy, a little disbelieving. “So… tomorrow evening. Late run. Overnight. Just you and me on one shuttle, Titus and Edward on the other.”

Joana nodded. “Exactly. Hale figured it was the most efficient way to get the supplies delivered without pulling anyone off regular rotation. Plus…” She glanced between them, eyes twinkling. “He said something about giving the young ones ‘room to breathe.’”

Cathy snorted. “He means ‘room to well you know .’”

Kelly laughed—loud, bright, the sound echoing softly in the empty lounge. “He’s not wrong.”

Hale sitting there with a smile giving both girls a wink and a nod . 

Then Joana saying As I was saying before Cathy interrupted me 

Titus froze mid-bite. “Yeah.”

Kelly and Cathy took it all in, exchanging a quick glance.

Joana’s expression softened. “I worked with her. Eighteen years ago. Same station. She was quiet—never talked much about family. Didn’t need to. She got my mom’s job when Mom moved up to director. Small world.”

Titus stared at her. “You… know her?”

“Know her work,” Joana said. “She was good. Better than good. Kept the lanes moving when half the sector was screaming. Everyone respected her. Still do.”

Cathy leaned in. “Everyone knows of your mom, Titus.”

Kelly squeezed his hand under the table. “Should have known.”

Joana  “Flight plan brief at 0800 tomorrow. 

Cathy leaned forward, voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “Overnight. Just us. On a shuttle. Alone. In deep space.”

Kelly’s smile turned slow and wicked. “Plenty of time for details.”

Cathy reached across the table, squeezed Kelly’s hands again. “I want every single detail . Edward looking at Titus “ I don’t want the details “ Titus thank you . 

Kelly’s breath hitched. “You’ll get them. All of them.”

They sat there a moment longer—hands clasped, foreheads almost touching—while the stars kept turning outside the viewport.

Cathy finally spoke, voice soft but fierce. “You know I love you, right? Like… sister love. Forever love.”

Kelly’s eyes filled again. “I know. I love you too. Always.”

Cathy grinned, wiping at her own eyes. “Good. Because tomorrow night? We’re gonna have a lot to talk about.”

Kelly laughed—bright, happy, full of promise.

“Deal.”

The evening stretched on.

Eventually trays were empty, mugs drained.

Edward checked his chrono. “All right. I’m turning in. Logistics at 0800, Titus. Don’t make me come drag you out of bed.”

Titus nodded. “Won’t happen.” Edward saying I was talking to Kelly . Kelly” yes uncle “ 

Edward stood, clapped him on the shoulder, and headed out.

Hale rose next. “Same goes for you two. Don’t make me regret lifting those communication restrictions.”

Kelly grinned. “No promises, Uncle.”

Hale shook his head, still smiling, and followed Edward out.

Joana stood last. She looked at Titus for a long moment.

“Tell your mom Joana Taylor says hello,” she said quietly. “And that she raised a good one.”

Titus swallowed. “I will.”

Joana nodded once, then left.

Cathy leaned across the table toward Kelly. “You’re gonna owe me every detail tomorrow.”

Kelly laughed. “You’re terrible.”

Cathy winked at Titus. “Welcome to the family, hotshot. You’re never getting rid of us now.” Standing up she walks  over to give Kelly a hug . 

Kelly saying Cathy no messages tonight please . Cathy smiling ok and leaves . 

Titus looked around the now-empty table—at the people who’d already claimed him—and felt something settle into place.

Not just a crew.

Not just a run.

A life.

Kelly took his hand under the table.

He squeezed back.

Kelly leaned in close, voice low. “Let’s go to your quarters. I want that music. And… maybe a little more.”

Titus grinned. “Lead the way.”

They stood, hands still linked, and walked out together—into the quiet corridors, into the night, into whatever came next.

The station kept turning.

1qfgvkb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qfgvkb,I made another kinetic sand table - Dune Weaver Gold,"Okay, I have a confession: I'm addicted to making these. This one is called Dune Weaver Gold, a 45cm (17-inch) side coffee table.

If you have not come across my project before, Dune Weaver is an open-source kinetic sand table that is super 3D printing friendly. The software is completely offline and open source. You can integrate it with other technologies. We have WLED integration and Home Assistant integration. I have two versions available for free on Maker World, and three paid models available on my website.

These kinetic sand tables are mesmerizing to watch. They use two Nema 17 motors controlled by a DLC32 board. The backend is hosted on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W. The idea is very simple: You have two axes, one controlling the rotation and the other controlling the radial movement. The magnet is mounted on the end of the radial arm, controlling a bearing ball or magnet ball on a sand surface. And with the magic of coding, you can create endlessly beautiful patterns.

What makes this project stand out from other open-source Kinetic Sand Table projects is that it is designed with 3D printing in mind.  That means you can print most, if not all, components. For components you cannot print, they are also readily available off the shelf, rather than requiring a CNC machine or a wood workshop to make.  The Dune Weaver Gold is designed around the IKEA TORSJÖ coffee table. I will also admit that I'm much more comfortable developing software than hardware, so I may have put too much effort into this on the software side.

Designing the Dune Weaver Gold was super fun. I quickly got to a prototype in about a weeks' time and fully assembled one together. Then I ran into all sorts of problems.

* My messy wiring job actually fried the UART pins of a Pi Zero 2W. During my bench test, everything worked, but when I put everything together, it didn't, and I couldn't, for the life of me, figure out what was going on.
* I fixed that and put everything together, and the LEDs were not working due to a loose connection. Hot Glue gun to the rescue
* It was also super hard to take off the motor assembly. Back to the drawing board.

But like with any other project, the first prototype is rarely ever the final version. After a couple of iterations, Dune Weaver Gold is ready, and now you can make one too. The cost for this project was about US$200 for me, with the biggest spend on the IKEA table.

Here are some new ideas in this version compared to my previous ones:

* Uses a mirror as the sand bed. The mirror is also from IKEA and is super thin, so we don't need a magnet ball anymore. A ball bearing would do, and the ball rolls!
* Fully enclosed design with heat vents at the bottom. Modular so that you can easily access the electronics and movement system for maintenance.
* Unique mounting system that attaches on top of the table legs.
* Break down complex parts so you don't have to reprint everything for adjustments/improvements.

If you're interested in this project, check out my website at [duneweaver.com](http://duneweaver.com) (3D printers required or you'd need to use a 3D printing service)

i’ve been modding rdr2, it’s like a very good game to get into modding. (for simpleness it would be games that have it built in like skyrim and fallout) I could never get to modding games like gta 4, but with the know-how now i think i can actually do it. I think even cyberpunk is easy im not sure. but rdr2 is actually an intermediate level and ive pretty much got it all working to where i just drop files into a folder called “lml” “lenny’s mod loader” and it puts all of the games in a mod manger for me so i can deactivate/activate them if they break my game. Last night i downloaded at least 15+ mods and wanted to see if i could even do that many without breaking my game… (no it broke the second i loaded the game) i tried a few things to make sure it wasn’t something that was an easy fix and after it wasn’t that, i had to eventually go and turn off all the mods and 1 by 1 go in the game each time testing to see which one it was breaking my game😭. but now i have my game almost completely modded i even added “hot coffee” and “harlot” mods you can search up what that means on your own. 

if anyone needs help doing the simple mods like adding lenny’s mod loader or rampage i can help it’s not the worst to mod but it definitely gave me a hour of trouble. I would also suggest watching a video, WATCH IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH; i thought i was a smart ass and it led to me actually having to delete all of my files (taking more time whether then me just watching the video and doing it correctly) and then delete and reinstall the game which just made it harder on my self.

i’ve got most of the mods that people would get (mexico,hot coffee, roleplay elements, better law, euphoria physics, bloodlust,ped damage, buying houses, seasons-that change, better quality for almost everything no ranging from the road and tree quality to just the items in game even gun overhauls and more particles.",1,1768665399.0,reddeadredemption,0,1.0,False

I am a 46-year-old man. For two years, I worked with a woman colleague who was 50, four years older than me. We are both married and have two children of the same age. We got along very well. We would chat and go to lunch together, sometimes with other colleagues. She would also bring me homemade dishes because she knew I enjoyed good food. Sometimes she would give me cakes and snacks; I felt she was almost like a big sister. Occasionally, she acted childishly around me—for instance, one day she ran toward me to talk to me like a child, and she would tease me during our discussions. Every time a workplace meal was organized for a celebration, she insisted I participate, even though I don’t typically enjoy work social events. Afterward, she would become colder and more distant. Sometimes she would ask me to go out at lunchtime with her to run some errands. She often suggested outings with the children, but I systematically refused because I had no desire to see a colleague outside of work.

Then I had problems with management—a kind of harassment that was very difficult for me. For several months, I didn’t speak to anyone at work, focusing only on my tasks and trying to get through that tough period. This colleague tried to find out why I was isolating myself, and I simply replied, ""I have a lot of work,"" without further explanation. One day, I ran into her by chance on the metro, and she came over to me, suggesting we travel together. She behaved in a way I would describe as flirting (she got very close to me, pressed her chest against my arm, and leaned in very close to speak to me). One day, she even came into my office to look at something on my screen and stood very close against me. I didn't know how to react because she is older, and I was quite surprised.

I eventually found another job in a different office, and my departure was announced. This colleague then came to see me, congratulated me, asked when my last day was, and said she was inviting me to lunch that day. On the day, she took me out and asked if she had done something wrong and why I wasn't speaking to her anymore. I explained that I had been suffering from harassment and had been looking for another job, which I had found.

She was relieved that my distant attitude wasn't because of her. She then continued to make flirting gestures, such as touching my hand. I then told her that since I was leaving for another office, we could stay in touch and see each other for family outings with the children and spouses (this might have been a mistake on my part!). Delighted, she organized several outings during the summer, and we saw each other regularly—always with our respective spouses at my request, as I didn't want us to meet without her husband and my wife. I thought our relationship was great. Except that sometimes, when I went out with my children and didn't tell her, she would point it out: ""You didn't call me, that's not nice."" Yet, it was her choice, and frankly, I didn't care. She also started criticizing her husband, saying he doesn't invest himself, that he just sits at home drinking coffee, and that he is old. When I asked her how they met, she told me he was the one who hit on her and that she wasn't interested at first because he was unemployed at the time. In short, it wasn't love at first sight. She also asked me to download series for her and put them on a USB stick—something her husband could have done.

She had promised to show me a cooking recipe. I suggested she come to the house with her family, that we all cook together, and then eat the meal as a group. But one day, after an outing with her son and mine (exceptionally without the spouses), she said, ""Let's meet at your place for the recipe."" Okay, so once we arrived at my house, I thought we would chat over coffee or tea, but she refused. She started cooking all by herself and did the dishes without saying a word. It was very bizarre. Then she said, ""The meal is ready, I have to go now."" She left the premises without even having a conversation. In my opinion, it was a truly strange scene.

She had planned to go on a trip to Spain with her family; I told her I knew that country well and preferred Portugal. She then decided to go to Portugal with her family instead. I found that weird.

She began organizing outings with both families herself—booking hotels, suggesting hikes, barbecues, and meals at home, or outings with the children to the pool, etc. She even wanted our two families to go abroad together or to a mountain chalet. She also suggested organizing a ""girls' trip"" for her and my mother to a spa. Then, after about ten intense outings and several dinner invitations at each other's homes, she suddenly stopped giving any news. Just like that. She used to call to suggest outings on the spot... One day, her husband was supposed to help me assemble furniture—a plan made weeks in advance—and on the day of, he bailed on me. She intervened to force him to keep his promise, and when I went to pick him up by car, he said to me in the auto during the trip: ""If she wants us to separate, no problem."" I didn't understand that comment.

Then, no more news at all... I wrote to her several times to see if everything was okay, and she replied briefly. I then sent New Year's greetings to her husband, but got no response. She had promised to give me contacts for renovation companies, which she never did.

I finally confronted her via SMS several months later, after hearing nothing... I asked her why they had disappeared and why she hadn't given me the promised renovation information. She wrote back saying she was on vacation. I wrote to her: ""The two of you disappeared without giving us the promised contacts; you are users (profiteurs)."" She then called twice, but I didn't answer. She then replied with something like: ""A true friend would have tried to find out why someone is distancing themselves,"" and concluded: ""This is where our relationship ends.""

1qfgqmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1qfgqmn/how_do_i_get_rid_of_a_parasitic_friend_at/,How do I get rid of a parasitic friend at university?,"I once met someone from my program, and she seemed very nice and helpful at first. At that time, she was one year ahead of me and gave me a lot of tips. Then, at some point, we had a course together and she completly avoidet me. Even when I actively messaged her asking if we wanted to grab a coffee during the break, she always ignored the messages until after the course and answered with „sorry I did not see your massege.“ We are a lot of students(500) so it‘s possible to not see each other.

At the very end of the semester, it finally worked out once and we talked during the 15 min break. She made a friend from my year, and I had the feeling she simply didn’t want us to get to know each other. Which is okay, I have other friends, it‘s just weird.

In the summer, there was a party we both went to. There, she passively aggressively insulted me in front of my friends, and she exchanged Instagram accounts and phone numbers with the other girl who studies the same subject as we do. After that, she wanted to do something together during the holidays, but only when other people had cancelled on her, and that hurt me once more. I actually didn’t want anything to do with her anymore.

She then only contacted me when she explicitly needed something, and I always helped her because she had helped me a lot at the beginning. I just gave her the same energy back, your not my priority and we only communicate about exams or stuff like that.

Now comes the strange part. I was in the library exactly once this semester with my friend sarah, she doesn’t know her. My friend and I walked in the library together, but we sat in completely different places. This so-called parasitic friend apparently observed this so closely that she remembered sarah. She‘s always in this library but not to learn but mostly for observing, flirting and gossiping.

Now, more than half a year later, she messaged me yesterday because she needed something again. I helped her, and today she messaged me again and asked whether my good friend Sarah is also taking a certain exam that I already took last year. The parasitic friend will be taking this exam soon as well, and she said she had seen that I’m friends with Sarah.

This is extremely strange, because I only walked into the library with her once. I think she has seen Sarah a few times in the course that they both took and now believes she can get access to her through me.

How can I get out of this situation without looking like an asshole? I don’t want to seem like I’m denying Sarah a study partner, but I also don’t want this parasite anywhere near me.",3,1768665260.0,NoStupidQuestions,5,1.0,False

Chapter 1: April Is the Thirstiest Month

April arrived like an unsolicited memory: bright, inappropriate, and determined to stay.

The city had been hot all week in a way that felt personal. Not summer-hot—no romance, no soft edges—just a dry, impatient heat that turned every sidewalk into an argument. The trees wore their new leaves like they were showing off. The sky stayed a flat, rinsed-out blue, refusing to do the one dramatic thing everyone secretly wanted: crack open.
     
Rowan Vale stood outside a café that sold iced drinks in cups that looked like laboratory equipment, holding a coffee that was already sweating more than they were. Their phone screen had a crack shaped like a coastline. Their reflection in it looked like someone who had slept eight hours but only emotionally logged two.
     
Inside the café, everyone was pretending not to stare at everyone else. A city-wide hobby.
     
Rowan checked the time. They checked it again, like it might have changed its mind.
     
A notification buzzed.
     
GRAIL — You’re early. That’s… cute.
     
Rowan rolled their eyes at the phone like it could be shamed into behaving.
     
“Don’t,” they muttered, because the app was a brand and brands didn’t have feelings and Rowan wasn’t going to start anthropomorphizing software in public. Not before lunch.
     
They pushed open the door. Cold air hit their face, the kind of air that made you want to forgive capitalism for just a second. The café smelled like espresso and fruit-based optimism.
     
At the back table, Jules Nadar was already there, dressed like a press release and a threat.
     
Jules rose dramatically when Rowan approached, like the entire café was their stage and the rest of humanity was simply set dressing.
     
“Rowan Vale,” Jules said, as if announcing the winner of a pageant no one had asked to attend. “You’re even hotter in person.”
     
Rowan blinked. 
“That’s alarming, because I’m not hot in person.”
     
Jules slid a coffee toward them. 
“I got you the one that tastes like sadness but costs like success.”
     
Rowan sat down. 
“You’re flirting with me.”
     
“I flirt with everyone,” Jules said. “It’s a nervous system regulation technique.”
     
Rowan took a sip. It tasted like burnt caramel and ambition. 
“What do you want?”
     
Jules leaned in. Their eyeliner was sharp enough to carve a future. 
“I want to hire you to write love.”
     
Rowan let out a small laugh that was mostly disbelief and partly a cry for help. “Love is a product now?”
     
“Love has always been a product,” Jules said breezily. “We’re just transparent about it. Unlike some people.”
     
Rowan glanced around. A couple at the next table leaned their heads together like they were posing for a photo, even though nobody was taking one. Across the room, a person in gym clothes scrolled with a face that said they were choosing their own suffering.
     
Rowan said, 
“What’s the job description?”
     
Jules tapped their manicured nail on the table, once, twice, like a countdown. 
“You’ll be on the copy team for GRAIL. You’ll write taglines. Prompts. Notifications. The emotional architecture. You’ll make people feel things.”
     
Rowan’s throat tightened, very slightly, like their body had heard the word architecture and remembered every building they’d ever gotten lost in.
     
They said, 
“That sounds like—” They stopped themselves from saying evil. They went with, “—a lot.”
     
“It’s a lot,” Jules agreed, thrilled. “It’s also money. And prestige. And a chance to become the type of person who doesn’t have to pretend they’re not hungry.”
    
Rowan frowned. 
“Hungry?”
     
Jules’s smile widened. 
“Thirsty. Same thing. Look around. The city’s dehydrated. People are drinking iced coffee like it’s holy water and still dying of longing.”
     
Rowan’s phone buzzed again, like it wanted to add to the conversation.
     
GRAIL — Feeling thirsty? Try Soulmate Mode.
     
Rowan’s jaw clenched.
     
Jules watched their face with the delight of someone observing a small animal discover a mirror. 
“Oh, you already have it.”
     
“It came with my phone,” Rowan lied. “Like the plague.”
     
Jules made a sympathetic sound that contained no sympathy. 
“Then you know what we’re up against.”
     
Rowan watched condensation slide down their cup. It fell like a tear that didn’t have the decency to mean anything.
     
“What exactly am I writing,” Rowan asked, “that you can’t write yourself?”
     
Jules placed a hand against their chest. “Babe. I can write. I can write so hard. But I can’t write you.”
     
Rowan looked at them. 
“That’s the most flattering insult I’ve ever received.”
     
Jules’s gaze sharpened. 
“We’re launching something new. A feature. It needs a voice. A voice that says ‘I am funny and I am deep,’ but not in a way that makes people run away.”
     
Rowan stirred their coffee like they could summon rain with a spoon. 
“So… no sincerity.”
     
“Sincerity,” Jules said carefully, “is a controlled substance. We’ll dose it. Micro-sincerity. Like microdosing mushrooms, but more embarrassing.”
     
Rowan considered this, feeling the old familiar tug: the part of them that wanted to say yes to anything that promised to make life more interesting, even if it would also make it more painful.
     
Jules slid a folder across the table. The logo was a chalice, stylized and smug.
     
Rowan opened it. The first page read:
     
SOULMATE MODE: STOP SETTLING. START SUMMONING.
     
Rowan stared.
     
They looked up slowly. 
“You’re joking.”
     
Jules lifted their shoulders. 
“It’s mythic. It’s bold. It’s—”
     
“It’s cursed,” Rowan said. “It’s like asking the universe to pick a fight with you.”
     
Jules smiled like a person who’d never asked the universe for anything they didn’t intend to take. 
“Exactly. People want drama. They want destiny. They want something to blame when it goes wrong. They want an algorithm they can call fate.”
     
Rowan flipped to the next page: example prompts.
     
What are you calling in?
What are you done pretending you don’t want?
Who do you keep meeting in different bodies?
     
Rowan swallowed. Something in their chest twitched, like a bruise being pressed.
     
“Who wrote these?” Rowan asked.
     
Jules leaned back. 
“Mina did the first round. Engineers get weird when you let them talk about feelings.”
     
Rowan’s phone buzzed again, impatient.
     
GRAIL — You could be meeting someone right now.
     
Rowan turned the phone face-down on the table as if it had committed a social crime.
     
Jules watched the motion and hummed. “Oh, you’re the type who gets mad at the void for texting you.”
     
“Maybe the void should stop texting me,” Rowan said.
     
Jules’s eyes softened, almost genuinely. “Rowan. You’re good at this. You write lines that stick in people’s throats. You can make them laugh and then hate themselves for laughing. We need that.”
     
Rowan’s laugh came out sharp. 
“That’s not a skill, it’s a personality defect.”
     
“Perfect,” Jules said. “Welcome to tech.”
     
Rowan slid the folder back. 
“I didn’t say yes.”
     
Jules clicked their tongue, faux offended. “You will.”
     
Rowan stared at them for a moment, then down at the tagline again.
     
Stop settling. Start summoning.
     
The words sat there like a dare.
     
Rowan’s phone buzzed, softer this time, like it was pretending to be innocent.
    
GRAIL — April is the thirstiest month.
     
Rowan froze.
     
They turned the phone over, staring at the screen as if it had sprouted teeth.
     
Jules blinked. 
“Did we push that line already?”
     
Rowan looked up. 
“Did you just—”
     
“I did not,” Jules said quickly. “I would never quote literature at someone without warning.”
     
Rowan’s fingers hovered over the notification like it was a spider. 
“Why would the app—”
     
Jules leaned in, suddenly serious. 
“Okay. That is new.”
     
Rowan’s skin prickled. The café’s air felt thinner. Somewhere near the front, someone laughed too loudly. It sounded like they were trying to escape their own body.
     
Rowan said, carefully, 
“How much access does this thing have?”
     
Jules’s expression flickered—just a second of something human. 
“Enough.”
     
Rowan stared at the tagline again, then back at the notification.
     
April is the thirstiest month.
     
It wasn’t their line. It wasn’t a line Jules would write, not like that. Too poetic. Too… precise.
     
Rowan’s stomach dipped.
     
Jules cleared their throat. 
“Ignore it. It’s probably just some test string. Engineers—”
     
“Don’t,” Rowan said. “Don’t hand-wave a ghost.”
     
Jules blinked. 
“A ghost?”
     
Rowan nodded toward the phone. 
“That thing just quoted… something. It’s not supposed to—”
     
Their phone buzzed again.
     
GRAIL — You don’t have to ignore it. You can answer.
    
Rowan felt, absurdly, like they were being watched. Not by cameras. By attention. By the kind of attention that didn’t care if they were ready.
     
They shoved the phone into their bag, hard enough to make the zipper complain.
     
Jules exhaled through their nose. 
“Okay. If you take the job, you get to see what’s under the hood. You get to find out why it’s doing that.”
     
“And if I don’t take the job,” Rowan said, “I get to keep living in blissful ignorance while my phone tries to seduce me with poetry.”
     
Jules lifted one finger. 
“Not seduce. Summon.”
     
Rowan rolled their eyes. 
“Stop saying summon like it’s normal.”
     
Jules grinned. 
“It’s going to be normal. That’s the point. We’re industrializing longing.”
     
Rowan picked up their coffee again, swallowed another mouthful, and felt it burn on the way down like penance.
     
“Fine,” they said. “I’ll come in. I’ll look. But if I get cursed, I’m invoicing you for spiritual damages.”
     
Jules clapped their hands once, delighted. “Yes. Yes! Welcome to the end of your peaceful life.”
     
Rowan stood, shouldering their bag. “You’re insane.”
     
“I’m employed,” Jules corrected. “See you at the Glass Cathedral.”
     
Rowan paused at the door, hand on the handle, looking back.
     
Jules was already on their phone, tapping fast. Their face glowed with the light of someone sending a message they knew would ruin somebody’s day.
     
Rowan pushed outside into the heat again. The sunlight slapped their cheeks like a warning.
     
On the street, a man in a suit walked past a woman in a dress so tight it looked like it was painted on. Neither of them looked at the other. Both of them were scrolling. A dog drank from a bowl outside a shop and still looked thirsty.
     
A bus went by with an ad on its side:
     
GRAIL — STOP SETTLING. START SUMMONING.
     
Rowan stared at it, unsettled by how quickly the words had escaped the folder and entered the world.
     
A cyclist shouted at a pedestrian. A pedestrian shouted back. A taxi honked like it was speaking in tongues.
     
Rowan walked, feeling sweat gather at the back of their neck.
     
Their phone buzzed in their bag, muffled but insistent.
     
Rowan kept walking.
     
It buzzed again.
     
Rowan’s hand slipped into the bag without permission. Their fingers wrapped around the phone like it was warm-blooded.
     
They pulled it out.
     
A new notification.
     
GRAIL — What are you calling in?
     
Rowan stared at it, heart doing a small, irritating flip.
     
They could ignore it. They should ignore it. They were an adult. They paid taxes. They didn’t answer algorithmic dares on the street like a teenager in a horror movie.
     
Rowan’s thumb hovered.
     
Another buzz, another line, appearing underneath like someone continuing a conversation Rowan hadn’t agreed to start.
     
GRAIL — Don’t be cool about it.
     
Rowan’s mouth went dry.
     
They looked up, scanning the street like they’d catch the sender hiding behind a lamppost. Nothing. Just people moving through heat and hunger like it was normal.
     
Rowan laughed—a short, disbelieving sound. 
“Oh, you’ve got jokes.”
     
A woman passing by glanced at Rowan with the polite alarm reserved for people talking to themselves.
    
Rowan tucked the phone away again and hurried toward the tube station, toward shade, toward anywhere the air didn’t feel like it was judging them.
     
As they descended the stairs, the noise of the city dimmed into a roar that was almost oceanic. The escalator carried them down, down, as if into an underworld lined with advertisements.
     
On the wall: another GRAIL poster.
     
A chalice.
     
A face half-lit by a screen.
     
A line of text Rowan hadn’t seen before:
     
YOU ARE NOT DYING OF LOVE. YOU ARE DYING OF NOT SAYING WHAT YOU WANT.
     
Rowan stared until the escalator pulled them past it.
     
Their phone vibrated one last time in their bag, like a final cough.
     
Rowan didn’t check it.
     
But in their mind, as if the city itself had whispered it, a phrase repeated—uninvited, sticky, and annoyingly beautiful:
     
April is the thirstiest month.
     
And above ground, the sky stayed clear, holding all its water back like it was waiting for something worth raining over.

I met a woman on a group hike last Sunday and we ended up talking one-on-one for about an hour. The conversation flowed really well and felt mutual, so I followed up afterward. We're both early thirties...

Here’s the exchange - all of it happened on Instagram... I asked for her handle during the hike:

**\[Me | Sun 21:51\]**  
Hey Anna, really enjoyed talking with you on the hike 😁  
Would you want to grab coffee or a drink sometime this week?

**\[Her | Mon 17:57\]**  
Hey Pete! Great meeting you yesterday as well :). Yes for sure we can grab a coffee. When are you free?

**\[Me | Mon 19:42\]**  
Awesome! How about Thursday? Btw, which neighborhood are you in again?

Do you have my Whatsapp? It’s \[number\] ... easier to communicate on there :)

**\[Her | Tue 16:02\]**  
Hey Pete, sorry this week got a little hectic with work and I won’t be able to go. I’ll text you next week on Whatsup :)

**\[Me | Tue 18:25\]**  
No worries! Good luck with work :)

**\[Her | Tue 18:25\]**  
Thank you 🙏

I’m trying to interpret this realistically. On one hand, she was warm, apologized, and explicitly said she’d text me next week. On the other hand, she didn’t suggest an alternative day or time.

I’m not planning to follow up unless she reaches out, but I’m curious how others usually read this kind of message. In your experience, is this more often a polite fade / soft no, or does it sometimes genuinely turn into a date later?

Not looking to game anything... just want an honest read so I can calibrate expectations and move on appropriately.

I went and manually upped the espresso temp by 2° but really don't want to mess around with it too much more before seeing if anyone else has had the same issue after descaling. Everything else is working fine and I'm doing my process as normal, I run an empty shot through the porta filter and into my cup to preheat everything.

Any suggestions on if something may be off? I can up the temperature manually again, but don't understand why since I wasn't having this issue prior to descaling.

After I used it a couple of times, I sawed off most of the plastic handle, to make it easier to use while holding a dish or filter underneath to catch the coffee.

Of course I use it gently so as not to mess up the declumper.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around some tables and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Each week we typically get a mix of regulars, people who drop by occasionally and a few newbies.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo ](https://postimg.cc/B8vN5xJc)). The bar staff also know who we are if you're not sure.

There's an optional Whatsapp group for the meetup -it's pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. If you really do want to join it just ask around at the meetup.",3,1768665103.0,LondonSocialClub,1,1.0,False

1qfgnn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qfgnn3/i_see_houses_appear_before_vanishing_forever_and/,I See Houses Appear Before Vanishing Forever And I Think Mine Is Next.,"Have you heard of “Last Thursdayism”? It's the idea that the entire world was created spontaneously last Thursday in this perfect state that appears as if it has a longer history. All the people were instantly made with fake memories already in their head. 

Now, I know it's meant more as a thought experiment than something real… but recent events have me rolling this idea around in my head constantly. Driving me nuts. Let me explain. 

I’ve been living out of my late grandpa’s old farmhouse a number of miles outside town for about a year now. It's modest, and I’ve done what I can to fix it up, but it's still a bit of a run down place. The area I’m situated in is very rural; many miles of flat, arid fields and few neighbors.  

In addition, I have to commute into town for work, which is about 25 miles away. Needless to say, I drive around these parts often and know the area well. I’ve only ever had one other house anywhere near me, this nice family that were friends with my grandpa before he passed. Their house is about a mile away from mine. 

This is all to say that I was puzzled when I saw the first house. It was sitting right smack-dab in the middle of a field I drive past every morning. I’d never seen it before. It didn’t look anywhere near new either. But I figured I must have just never noticed it before now. I kept on driving.

But, I swear to God, on my way home that night, and maybe it was just dark and I was mixing things up, but the house was gone. The field was back to how I remembered it. Empty.

I went on with my day-to-day for the next week, all the while not being able to shake that house from my head. 

I checked out the area a couple times on my commute. There was no mark of a foundation ever being present, a driveway ever being there. I just didn’t get it. I was pretty sure there were even lights on inside. Was someone there?

I next noticed a lone grain silo at a four-way intersection 12 miles out of town. Not near any farm or anything, just standing there, huge and rusty, silently bearing down on me with its existence, because I *knew* it hadn’t been there just the other day. I stopped my car and got out. 

I ran my fingers across the cool, solid metal. I hit it with my palm, a hollow bang resonating back. I crouched down and saw how it was firmly planted into the ground. How the grass grew around it, but not under it. This must have been here for years. 

That silo remained for a few days before it, too, disappeared. I inspected it just as I had with the house. The grass grew where it once hadn’t. No buildings around whatsoever. I felt that feeling you get when someone’s watching you… that spine-tingling feeling. I tried to ignore it. These things must be my imagination. That’s the only explanation that made any sense.

It was only a day after the silo disappeared that I found a new, well, really old looking mobile home a few miles away from my house. It was sitting near the road, sagging under its own weight, covered in kudzu. There was actually even a rusty ford pick-up parked right next to it.

I saw a glimpse of a person through the window, though I couldn’t make out much detail. I considered stopping to speak to them before realizing how late I was for work already. I’d have to talk after work.

Color me surprised to find *no* mobile home anywhere on my drive home that evening. No sign of one. No pick-up truck. Nothing. I decided then that whatever I find next, I needed to get answers. I can afford to be late to work.

For the next month, I didn’t see anything unusual. The days passed how they had in the past and things began to feel normal again. 

I woke up one morning, made my coffee, scrolled on my phone, got dressed, the usual. I think that was the first morning in a while where I didn’t have that mobile home on my mind. It was a good morning. I grabbed my briefcase and walked out the door.

The color of it caught me off guard first. 

It was bright blue, the color of the sky. The farmhouse gleamed proudly, right on the opposite side of the road, right across from my house. It had a big shed and a bigger garden on either side. A couple cars were parked out front. It was so new, so cared for, it was all practically shining in the morning light. A woman wearing an apron walked out the front door and waved at me with a smile.

My briefcase fell from my hand and a cool chill ran up my spine. It felt like something was breathing down my neck.

I had to speak to this woman. I paced down my driveway and onto and past the road, approaching her.

“Good morning,” she said, her waving hand falling and resting on the pristine white railing of the porch.

“Hi, good morning! Can I speak to you real quick?” My words were quick and short of breath.

“Sure, is everything alright?”

“Uh, when did y'all move in? Build this place? Looks pretty new.”

She laughed quietly. “What do you mean? We’ve been here about seven years now. Before you even. I knew your grandfather. You know that.”

“I… forgive me, I know this is odd. But that just isn’t true. I’ve been here a while and I don’t know you or your house.” I glanced past her, through the window, to see three kids at a dining table.

The smile faded from her face and concern took its place. “Are you sure you’re alright? You seem a little confused. Do you want some water?”

At this point I didn’t think I would get much further than this and I didn’t want her to think I was totally crazy. So I dropped it.

“No, that's fine, thank you. Sorry for the mix-up, I’ll be on my way now.”

“Okay, well, have a good day!” She tried to smile at me again but I could tell there was something else in her eyes.

I walked back to my yard, grabbed my briefcase, and threw it into the car. I sat there for a good minute and stared out at the house, into that window. A *whole family*. How did this happen? Am I crazy?

I went to work.

A whole week passed and nothing changed. The blue farmhouse remained, and the family in it too. I actually talked some more to them as I ran into them throughout the days. I became well-acquainted with the husband and they even invited me over for dinner. Things were fine.

A few weeks later, I drove home from work, and was backing into my driveway, when I saw it. Or didn’t. The landscape before me, on the other side of the road, was barren. A black, empty field that went as far as the eye could see. I stopped and sprinted out of my car and into the field. 

A sweat began to form on my neck and back and I breathed hard as I strained to look around for something, anything, a sign at all. I kicked at the grass and pulled a clump of dirt from the ground. I watched it fall from my hand, fading to nothing. There was never a house here. Never a family. No cars. No shed. No garden. I ran back to my house and slammed the door shut. I couldn’t sleep that night.

I was freaked out and decided I needed to talk to my only neighbors that lived a mile away. There’s no way I’ve been the only one seeing things. I got up the next morning and got dressed to make a visit. 

Just as I walked out the door, I saw a kid climbing up the big oak tree in my front yard. I recognized him as the kid of the neighboring family. I walked down the gravel driveway and looked up at him in the tree. 

“Having fun up there?” I asked.

“Hey, mister! Can I ask you a question?” The kid slid down a branch and settled closer to me.

“Course you can. What’s up?” 

The boy wiped the sweat from his furrowed brow. “When did you move here? I’ve never seen you before.”

“Well, uh, my grandpa lived here before me, but he passed. I’ve been here for a year now.”

“A whole year? Didn’t you just build this house? I’d never seen it before today.”

A chill ran down my spine. “I… I mean, maybe you’ve just never walked over here before.”

“I walk here every Saturday morning to build my fort! See?” He pointed to the buckets, planks, and drawings etched into the bark that lay scattered throughout the tree. “You must be good at building houses! Wanna help me?”

My throat turned dry and I backed away a few paces. “I think you can handle it fine yourself, kid.” I turned my back on him and walked back into the house, shutting the door and locking it.

My world was spinning. I felt nauseous. I peeked my head through the blinds and I could see the kid staring at me, my house. Did I just appear today? Am I going to disappear? 

Am I even real?

I didn’t see the neighbors. I couldn’t stomach it. Still can’t. I’ve just been sitting at home for the past three days since I talked to the kid. 

I feel like those people I talked to. I thought they were fake… and maybe that’s true. But… did they think they were real? I guess so, they told me so themselves. Where did they go once their house disappeared? Will I find out?

I’m obsessed with this. I can’t stop thinking about it. What, if any, of my memories are real? Are my memories of seeing these fake houses even real? Are those kid’s memories real? Jesus. I’m going crazy.

I haven’t disappeared yet, but I’m convinced something's going to happen soon. I’m writing this all down and posting this just so I made a mark. I need people to know I exist. That I was here, if god forbid, something really does happen.

I am real.

I am real.

Chapter 1: April Is the Thirstiest Month

April arrived like an unsolicited memory: bright, inappropriate, and determined to stay.

The city had been hot all week in a way that felt personal. Not summer-hot—no romance, no soft edges—just a dry, impatient heat that turned every sidewalk into an argument. The trees wore their new leaves like they were showing off. The sky stayed a flat, rinsed-out blue, refusing to do the one dramatic thing everyone secretly wanted: crack open.
     
Rowan Vale stood outside a café that sold iced drinks in cups that looked like laboratory equipment, holding a coffee that was already sweating more than they were. Their phone screen had a crack shaped like a coastline. Their reflection in it looked like someone who had slept eight hours but only emotionally logged two.
     
Inside the café, everyone was pretending not to stare at everyone else. A city-wide hobby.
     
Rowan checked the time. They checked it again, like it might have changed its mind.
     
A notification buzzed.
     
GRAIL — You’re early. That’s… cute.
     
Rowan rolled their eyes at the phone like it could be shamed into behaving.
     
“Don’t,” they muttered, because the app was a brand and brands didn’t have feelings and Rowan wasn’t going to start anthropomorphizing software in public. Not before lunch.
     
They pushed open the door. Cold air hit their face, the kind of air that made you want to forgive capitalism for just a second. The café smelled like espresso and fruit-based optimism.
     
At the back table, Jules Nadar was already there, dressed like a press release and a threat.
     
Jules rose dramatically when Rowan approached, like the entire café was their stage and the rest of humanity was simply set dressing.
     
“Rowan Vale,” Jules said, as if announcing the winner of a pageant no one had asked to attend. “You’re even hotter in person.”
     
Rowan blinked. 
“That’s alarming, because I’m not hot in person.”
     
Jules slid a coffee toward them. 
“I got you the one that tastes like sadness but costs like success.”
     
Rowan sat down. 
“You’re flirting with me.”
     
“I flirt with everyone,” Jules said. “It’s a nervous system regulation technique.”
     
Rowan took a sip. It tasted like burnt caramel and ambition. 
“What do you want?”
     
Jules leaned in. Their eyeliner was sharp enough to carve a future. 
“I want to hire you to write love.”
     
Rowan let out a small laugh that was mostly disbelief and partly a cry for help. “Love is a product now?”
     
“Love has always been a product,” Jules said breezily. “We’re just transparent about it. Unlike some people.”
     
Rowan glanced around. A couple at the next table leaned their heads together like they were posing for a photo, even though nobody was taking one. Across the room, a person in gym clothes scrolled with a face that said they were choosing their own suffering.
     
Rowan said, 
“What’s the job description?”
     
Jules tapped their manicured nail on the table, once, twice, like a countdown. 
“You’ll be on the copy team for GRAIL. You’ll write taglines. Prompts. Notifications. The emotional architecture. You’ll make people feel things.”
     
Rowan’s throat tightened, very slightly, like their body had heard the word architecture and remembered every building they’d ever gotten lost in.
     
They said, 
“That sounds like—” They stopped themselves from saying evil. They went with, “—a lot.”
     
“It’s a lot,” Jules agreed, thrilled. “It’s also money. And prestige. And a chance to become the type of person who doesn’t have to pretend they’re not hungry.”
    
Rowan frowned. 
“Hungry?”
     
Jules’s smile widened. 
“Thirsty. Same thing. Look around. The city’s dehydrated. People are drinking iced coffee like it’s holy water and still dying of longing.”
     
Rowan’s phone buzzed again, like it wanted to add to the conversation.
     
GRAIL — Feeling thirsty? Try Soulmate Mode.
     
Rowan’s jaw clenched.
     
Jules watched their face with the delight of someone observing a small animal discover a mirror. 
“Oh, you already have it.”
     
“It came with my phone,” Rowan lied. “Like the plague.”
     
Jules made a sympathetic sound that contained no sympathy. 
“Then you know what we’re up against.”
     
Rowan watched condensation slide down their cup. It fell like a tear that didn’t have the decency to mean anything.
     
“What exactly am I writing,” Rowan asked, “that you can’t write yourself?”
     
Jules placed a hand against their chest. “Babe. I can write. I can write so hard. But I can’t write you.”
     
Rowan looked at them. 
“That’s the most flattering insult I’ve ever received.”
     
Jules’s gaze sharpened. 
“We’re launching something new. A feature. It needs a voice. A voice that says ‘I am funny and I am deep,’ but not in a way that makes people run away.”
     
Rowan stirred their coffee like they could summon rain with a spoon. 
“So… no sincerity.”
     
“Sincerity,” Jules said carefully, “is a controlled substance. We’ll dose it. Micro-sincerity. Like microdosing mushrooms, but more embarrassing.”
     
Rowan considered this, feeling the old familiar tug: the part of them that wanted to say yes to anything that promised to make life more interesting, even if it would also make it more painful.
     
Jules slid a folder across the table. The logo was a chalice, stylized and smug.
     
Rowan opened it. The first page read:
     
SOULMATE MODE: STOP SETTLING. START SUMMONING.
     
Rowan stared.
     
They looked up slowly. 
“You’re joking.”
     
Jules lifted their shoulders. 
“It’s mythic. It’s bold. It’s—”
     
“It’s cursed,” Rowan said. “It’s like asking the universe to pick a fight with you.”
     
Jules smiled like a person who’d never asked the universe for anything they didn’t intend to take. 
“Exactly. People want drama. They want destiny. They want something to blame when it goes wrong. They want an algorithm they can call fate.”
     
Rowan flipped to the next page: example prompts.
     
What are you calling in?
What are you done pretending you don’t want?
Who do you keep meeting in different bodies?
     
Rowan swallowed. Something in their chest twitched, like a bruise being pressed.
     
“Who wrote these?” Rowan asked.
     
Jules leaned back. 
“Mina did the first round. Engineers get weird when you let them talk about feelings.”
     
Rowan’s phone buzzed again, impatient.
     
GRAIL — You could be meeting someone right now.
     
Rowan turned the phone face-down on the table as if it had committed a social crime.
     
Jules watched the motion and hummed. “Oh, you’re the type who gets mad at the void for texting you.”
     
“Maybe the void should stop texting me,” Rowan said.
     
Jules’s eyes softened, almost genuinely. “Rowan. You’re good at this. You write lines that stick in people’s throats. You can make them laugh and then hate themselves for laughing. We need that.”
     
Rowan’s laugh came out sharp. 
“That’s not a skill, it’s a personality defect.”
     
“Perfect,” Jules said. “Welcome to tech.”
     
Rowan slid the folder back. 
“I didn’t say yes.”
     
Jules clicked their tongue, faux offended. “You will.”
     
Rowan stared at them for a moment, then down at the tagline again.
     
Stop settling. Start summoning.
     
The words sat there like a dare.
     
Rowan’s phone buzzed, softer this time, like it was pretending to be innocent.
    
GRAIL — April is the thirstiest month.
     
Rowan froze.
     
They turned the phone over, staring at the screen as if it had sprouted teeth.
     
Jules blinked. 
“Did we push that line already?”
     
Rowan looked up. 
“Did you just—”
     
“I did not,” Jules said quickly. “I would never quote literature at someone without warning.”
     
Rowan’s fingers hovered over the notification like it was a spider. 
“Why would the app—”
     
Jules leaned in, suddenly serious. 
“Okay. That is new.”
     
Rowan’s skin prickled. The café’s air felt thinner. Somewhere near the front, someone laughed too loudly. It sounded like they were trying to escape their own body.
     
Rowan said, carefully, 
“How much access does this thing have?”
     
Jules’s expression flickered—just a second of something human. 
“Enough.”
     
Rowan stared at the tagline again, then back at the notification.
     
April is the thirstiest month.
     
It wasn’t their line. It wasn’t a line Jules would write, not like that. Too poetic. Too… precise.
     
Rowan’s stomach dipped.
     
Jules cleared their throat. 
“Ignore it. It’s probably just some test string. Engineers—”
     
“Don’t,” Rowan said. “Don’t hand-wave a ghost.”
     
Jules blinked. 
“A ghost?”
     
Rowan nodded toward the phone. 
“That thing just quoted… something. It’s not supposed to—”
     
Their phone buzzed again.
     
GRAIL — You don’t have to ignore it. You can answer.
    
Rowan felt, absurdly, like they were being watched. Not by cameras. By attention. By the kind of attention that didn’t care if they were ready.
     
They shoved the phone into their bag, hard enough to make the zipper complain.
     
Jules exhaled through their nose. 
“Okay. If you take the job, you get to see what’s under the hood. You get to find out why it’s doing that.”
     
“And if I don’t take the job,” Rowan said, “I get to keep living in blissful ignorance while my phone tries to seduce me with poetry.”
     
Jules lifted one finger. 
“Not seduce. Summon.”
     
Rowan rolled their eyes. 
“Stop saying summon like it’s normal.”
     
Jules grinned. 
“It’s going to be normal. That’s the point. We’re industrializing longing.”
     
Rowan picked up their coffee again, swallowed another mouthful, and felt it burn on the way down like penance.
     
“Fine,” they said. “I’ll come in. I’ll look. But if I get cursed, I’m invoicing you for spiritual damages.”
     
Jules clapped their hands once, delighted. “Yes. Yes! Welcome to the end of your peaceful life.”
     
Rowan stood, shouldering their bag. “You’re insane.”
     
“I’m employed,” Jules corrected. “See you at the Glass Cathedral.”
     
Rowan paused at the door, hand on the handle, looking back.
     
Jules was already on their phone, tapping fast. Their face glowed with the light of someone sending a message they knew would ruin somebody’s day.
     
Rowan pushed outside into the heat again. The sunlight slapped their cheeks like a warning.
     
On the street, a man in a suit walked past a woman in a dress so tight it looked like it was painted on. Neither of them looked at the other. Both of them were scrolling. A dog drank from a bowl outside a shop and still looked thirsty.
     
A bus went by with an ad on its side:
     
GRAIL — STOP SETTLING. START SUMMONING.
     
Rowan stared at it, unsettled by how quickly the words had escaped the folder and entered the world.
     
A cyclist shouted at a pedestrian. A pedestrian shouted back. A taxi honked like it was speaking in tongues.
     
Rowan walked, feeling sweat gather at the back of their neck.
     
Their phone buzzed in their bag, muffled but insistent.
     
Rowan kept walking.
     
It buzzed again.
     
Rowan’s hand slipped into the bag without permission. Their fingers wrapped around the phone like it was warm-blooded.
     
They pulled it out.
     
A new notification.
     
GRAIL — What are you calling in?
     
Rowan stared at it, heart doing a small, irritating flip.
     
They could ignore it. They should ignore it. They were an adult. They paid taxes. They didn’t answer algorithmic dares on the street like a teenager in a horror movie.
     
Rowan’s thumb hovered.
     
Another buzz, another line, appearing underneath like someone continuing a conversation Rowan hadn’t agreed to start.
     
GRAIL — Don’t be cool about it.
     
Rowan’s mouth went dry.
     
They looked up, scanning the street like they’d catch the sender hiding behind a lamppost. Nothing. Just people moving through heat and hunger like it was normal.
     
Rowan laughed—a short, disbelieving sound. 
“Oh, you’ve got jokes.”
     
A woman passing by glanced at Rowan with the polite alarm reserved for people talking to themselves.
    
Rowan tucked the phone away again and hurried toward the tube station, toward shade, toward anywhere the air didn’t feel like it was judging them.
     
As they descended the stairs, the noise of the city dimmed into a roar that was almost oceanic. The escalator carried them down, down, as if into an underworld lined with advertisements.
     
On the wall: another GRAIL poster.
     
A chalice.
     
A face half-lit by a screen.
     
A line of text Rowan hadn’t seen before:
     
YOU ARE NOT DYING OF LOVE. YOU ARE DYING OF NOT SAYING WHAT YOU WANT.
     
Rowan stared until the escalator pulled them past it.
     
Their phone vibrated one last time in their bag, like a final cough.
     
Rowan didn’t check it.
     
But in their mind, as if the city itself had whispered it, a phrase repeated—uninvited, sticky, and annoyingly beautiful:
     
April is the thirstiest month.
     
And above ground, the sky stayed clear, holding all its water back like it was waiting for something worth raining over.

I Think Mine Is Next.,"Have you heard of “Last Thursdayism”? It's the idea that the entire world was created spontaneously last Thursday in this perfect state that appears as if it has a longer history. All the people were instantly made with fake memories already in their head. 

Now, I know it's meant more as a thought experiment than something real… but recent events have me rolling this idea around in my head constantly. Driving me nuts. Let me explain. 

I’ve been living out of my late grandpa’s old farmhouse a number of miles outside town for about a year now. It's modest, and I’ve done what I can to fix it up, but it's still a bit of a run down place. The area I’m situated in is very rural; many miles of flat, arid fields and few neighbors.  

In addition, I have to commute into town for work, which is about 25 miles away. Needless to say, I drive around these parts often and know the area well. I’ve only ever had one other house anywhere near me, this nice family that were friends with my grandpa before he passed. Their house is about a mile away from mine. 

This is all to say that I was puzzled when I saw the first house. It was sitting right smack-dab in the middle of a field I drive past every morning. I’d never seen it before. It didn’t look anywhere near new either. But I figured I must have just never noticed it before now. I kept on driving.

But, I swear to God, on my way home that night, and maybe it was just dark and I was mixing things up, but the house was gone. The field was back to how I remembered it. Empty.

I went on with my day-to-day for the next week, all the while not being able to shake that house from my head. 

I checked out the area a couple times on my commute. There was no mark of a foundation ever being present, a driveway ever being there. I just didn’t get it. I was pretty sure there were even lights on inside. Was someone there?

I next noticed a lone grain silo at a four-way intersection 12 miles out of town. Not near any farm or anything, just standing there, huge and rusty, silently bearing down on me with its existence, because I *knew* it hadn’t been there just the other day. I stopped my car and got out. 

I ran my fingers across the cool, solid metal. I hit it with my palm, a hollow bang resonating back. I crouched down and saw how it was firmly planted into the ground. How the grass grew around it, but not under it. This must have been here for years. 

That silo remained for a few days before it, too, disappeared. I inspected it just as I had with the house. The grass grew where it once hadn’t. No buildings around whatsoever. I felt that feeling you get when someone’s watching you… that spine-tingling feeling. I tried to ignore it. These things must be my imagination. That’s the only explanation that made any sense.

It was only a day after the silo disappeared that I found a new, well, really old looking mobile home a few miles away from my house. It was sitting near the road, sagging under its own weight, covered in kudzu. There was actually even a rusty ford pick-up parked right next to it.

I saw a glimpse of a person through the window, though I couldn’t make out much detail. I considered stopping to speak to them before realizing how late I was for work already. I’d have to talk after work.

Color me surprised to find *no* mobile home anywhere on my drive home that evening. No sign of one. No pick-up truck. Nothing. I decided then that whatever I find next, I needed to get answers. I can afford to be late to work.

For the next month, I didn’t see anything unusual. The days passed how they had in the past and things began to feel normal again. 

I woke up the morning, made my coffee, scrolled on my phone, got dressed, the usual. I think that was the first morning in a while where I didn’t have that mobile home on my mind. It was a good morning. I grabbed my briefcase and walked out the door.

The color of it caught me off guard first. 

It was bright blue, the color of the sky. The farmhouse gleamed proudly, right on the opposite side of the road, right across from my house. It had a big shed and a bigger garden on either side. A couple cars were parked out front. It was so new, so cared for, it was all practically shining in the morning light. A woman wearing an apron walked out the front door and waved at me with a smile.

My briefcase fell from my hand and a cool chill ran up my spine. It felt like something was breathing down my neck.

I had to speak to this woman. I paced down my driveway and onto and past the road, approaching her.

“Good morning,” she said, her waving hand falling and resting on the pristine white railing of the porch.

“Hi, good morning! Can I speak to you real quick?” My words were quick and short of breath.

“Sure, is everything alright?”

“Uh, when did y'all move in? Build this place? Looks pretty new.”

She laughed quietly. “What do you mean? We’ve been here about seven years now. Before you even. I knew your grandfather. You know that.”

“I… forgive me, I know this is odd. But that just isn’t true. I’ve been here a while and I don’t know you or your house.” I glanced past her, through the window, to see three kids at a dining table.

The smile faded from her face and concern took its place. “Are you sure you’re alright? You seem a little confused. Do you want some water?”

At this point I didn’t think I would get much further than this and I didn’t want her to think I was totally crazy. So I dropped it.

“No, that's fine, thank you. Sorry for the mix-up, I’ll be on my way now.”

“Okay, well, have a good day!” She tried to smile at me again but I could tell there was something else in her eyes.

I walked back to my yard, grabbed my briefcase, and threw it into the car. I sat there for a good minute and stared out at the house, into that window. A *whole family*. How did this happen? Am I crazy?

I went to work.

A whole week passed and nothing changed. The blue farmhouse remained, and the family in it too. I actually talked some more to them as I ran into them throughout the days. I became well-acquainted with the husband and they even invited me over for dinner. Things were fine.

A few weeks later, I drove home from work, and was backing into my driveway, when I saw it. Or didn’t. The landscape before me, on the other side of the road, was barren. A black, empty field that went as far as the eye could see. I stopped and sprinted out of my car and into the field. 

A sweat began to form on my neck and back and I breathed hard as I strained to look around for something, anything, a sign at all. I kicked at the grass and pulled a clump of dirt from the ground. I watched it fall from my hand, fading to nothing. There was never a house here. Never a family. No cars. No shed. No garden. I ran back to my house and slammed the door shut. I couldn’t sleep that night.

I was freaked out and decided I needed to talk to my only neighbors that lived a mile away. There’s no way I’ve been the only one seeing things. I got up the next morning and got dressed to make a visit. 

Just as I walked out the door, I saw a kid climbing up the big oak tree in my front yard. I recognized him as the kid of the neighboring family. I walked down the gravel driveway and looked up at him in the tree. 

“Having fun up there?” I asked.

“Hey, mister! Can I ask you a question?” The kid slid down a branch and settled closer to me.

“Course you can. What’s up?” 

The boy wiped the sweat from his furrowed brow. “When did you move here? I’ve never seen you before.”

“Well, uh, my grandpa lived here before me, but he passed. I’ve been here for a year now.”

“A whole year? Didn’t you just build this house? I’d never seen it before today.”

A chill ran down my spine. “I… I mean, maybe you’ve just never walked over here before.”

“I walk here every Saturday morning to build my fort! See?” He pointed to the buckets, planks, and drawings etched into the bark that lay scattered throughout the tree. “You must be good at building houses! Wanna help me?”

My throat turned dry and I backed away a few paces. “I think you can handle it fine yourself, kid.” I turned my back on him and walked back into the house, shutting the door and locking it.

My world was spinning. I felt nauseous. I peeked my head through the blinds and I could see the kid staring at me, my house. Did I just appear today? Am I going to disappear? 

Am I even real?

I didn’t see the neighbors. I couldn’t stomach it. Still can’t. I’ve just been sitting at home for the past three days since I talked to the kid. 

I feel like those people I talked to. I thought they were fake… and maybe that’s true. But… did they think they were real? I guess so, they told me so themselves. Where did they go once their house disappeared? Will I find out?

I’m obsessed with this. I can’t stop thinking about it. What, if any, of my memories are real? Are my memories of seeing these fake houses even real? Are those kid’s memories real? Jesus. I’m going crazy.

I haven't disappeared yet, but I’m convinced something's going to happen soon. I’m writing this all down and posting this just so I made a mark. I need people to know I exist. That I was here, if god forbid, something really does happen.

I am real.

I am real.

I went out to a different city than the one I live at a couple days ago and saw all of these people!

**Person 1**

This teacher I had a huge crush on and haven't seen him in two years. I thought about him and how I really wanted to see him. I held this thought for maybe 5-10 minutes but probably kept thinking about him here and there throughout the day. While I was out, I saw him sitting by himself at a cafe terrace having his coffee and greeted him!

**Person 2**

This one was a guy that worked at a store that I found him to be so handsome. I used to go to the store occasionally just to take a look at him. He has been working there for a few years but recently when I went there, he was nowhere to be found. I kept going and nothing. I was sad that he probably wasn't working there anymore. So this day I went out, I was giving out job applications at places and one of my friends suggested me that I would give one at this specific restaurant. I go to the restaurant, I ask one of the employees there and she requests me to wait just a few minutes that someone would come talk to me. I was flabbergasted that the person that showed up in front of me was the handsome guy from the store!! Apparently he is either the owner of the restaurant or one of the management.

**Person 3**

This is a girl I came accross on Instagram and found her to be very beautiful plus I love the art she does! I kept looking at her pictures and art and how it would be so nice to see her personally. I go visit my friend that works at a cafe and I see the girl there! I did't talk with her or anything because I had to go get the last bus back home plus she was with other people so I wouldn't go interfere.

**Person 4**

Ah yes, this one is a SP I had manifested before and whom I truly liked and we have a story together. I had to distance myself from him because he is a womanizer and it was only bringing me pain and suffering. But lately I couldn't stop thinking about him and had this strong urge to go see him. I tried to resist the urge and avoided crossing paths with him as much as I could. He is a bus driver and I know his work schedule so I avoided going on the bus that he drives. The thing is, that day, circumstances forced me to go out of home and I had no choice but to get on the bus he drives.

So I just thought about these people and held the image or essence of them in my mind and they all showed up at once in that same day!",1,1768664929.0,Manifestation,0,1.0,False

In einer Welt, in der industrielle Röstungen oft den Standard diktieren, setzen wir mit diesem Set ein Zeichen für Transparenz und Qualität. Es handelt sich nicht um ein einfaches Sortiment, sondern um eine sorgfältig kuratierte Selektion der besten Bohnen weltweit, die nach den strengen Richtlinien der Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) bewertet wurden.

# Die Philosophie hinter Spezialitätenkaffee

Spezialitätenkaffee ist mehr als nur ein Begriff – es ist ein Qualitätsversprechen. Nur Kaffee, der in einem standardisierten Cupping-Verfahren mindestens 80 von 100 Punkten erreicht, darf diesen Titel tragen. In der **World's Finest Specialty Coffee Gift Box** finden Sie ausschließlich solche Spitzenkaffees. Dabei geht es nicht nur um den Geschmack, sondern um die gesamte Wertschöpfungskette: Vom Mikroklima der Plantage über die Erntemethode bis hin zur präzisen Röstung wird jeder Schritt überwacht, um die natürlichen Terroir-Noten der Bohne zu erhalten.

Ein herausragendes Beispiel für diese Exzellenz ist der **Mzuzu Coffee** aus Malawi. Dieser Kaffee steht oft stellvertretend für die Qualität, die wir anstreben: Eine feine Säure, ein balancierter Körper und komplexe Aromen von Beeren und Schokolade. Wir nutzen solche Profile, um unseren Kunden zu zeigen, wie vielfältig Kaffeegenuss sein kann, wenn man die ausgetretenen Pfade des Supermarkt-Kaffees verlässt.

# Innovation: Das Brew-in-the-bag System erklärt

Warum braucht ein **Kaffeeliebhaber** heute keine teuren Siebträgermaschinen von **DeLonghi** oder Vollautomaten mehr, um Barista-Qualität zu erleben? Die Lösung liegt im innovativen Design der Beutel innerhalb der **World's Finest Specialty Coffee Gift Box**. Das patentierte „Brew-in-the-bag“-Verfahren kombiniert die Vorteile einer French Press mit der Reinheit eines Handfilters. Der Beutel fungiert gleichzeitig als Brühgefäß und Kanne.

Dieses System ist besonders für Menschen gedacht, die auch unterwegs – sei es beim Camping, im Büro oder auf Reisen – nicht auf ihren gewohnten Standard verzichten möchten. Man benötigt lediglich heißes Wasser, um innerhalb von 4 bis 8 Minuten einen frischen Single-Origin Kaffee aufzubrühen. Da die Bohnen direkt im Beutel extrahiert werden, bleiben alle ätherischen Öle und feinen Nuancen erhalten, die bei herkömmlichen Filtermethoden oft verloren gehen.

In einer Zeit der Digitalisierung ist ein solches analoges Genusserlebnis ein seltener Luxus. Es bietet deutlich mehr emotionalen Wert als ein einfaches [**Fruit Tea Set**](https://brew-blend.de/collections/tee-geschenkset), da die Komplexität der Aromen den Beschenkten immer wieder aufs Neue überrascht.

# Nachhaltigkeit und E-E-A-T: Unser Versprechen

Hi. This is my first reddit post, and I’m looking for someone that can help me. Has anyone heard of Juniper Bed and Breakfast in South Mississippi. It was my grandmother’s, and I’m looking for information about it. Mostly, I’m just worried. Strange things keep happening here, and I was hoping that one of you would be able to help. You may be wondering how I got here. I’d love to tell you that it is a whirlwind adventure and somehow, I found out that I’m a millionaire, but that is far from the truth.

I guess that I’ll just start at the beginning. I was driving home, listening to music, and trying to decompress after a long and tiring day. The back roads were empty, and the shadows were growing longer as the sunlight faded. I left the clinic in a hurry, wanting to plop down onto my couch and bask in the luxurious silence of an empty apartment. However, that monotonous drive was interrupted when I received a call from Taylor General Hospital. I figured it was another call to schedule one of my grandmother’s appointments. They could never get her to answer her own phone, so it didn’t surprise me.

“Is this Ms. Clifton’s granddaughter, Carrie? You were her emergency contact on file,” said the employee.

It was not the regular chipper girl who called about scheduling. This wasn’t concerning an appointment at all, and I felt a nervous tinge in the back of my head.

“I am,” I replied, feeling a lump forming in my throat.

“My name is Trina. I’m a nurse at Taylor General Hospital. Your grandmother collapsed after leaving her check-up appointment today.”

That conversation changed everything. I drove three hours to Taylor General Hospital in rural Mississippi to discover that my grandmother had suffered a debilitating stroke, and she would need around the clock care. Life can change quickly, and I certainly was unprepared. But I don't think anyone is.

You may be wondering why I was her only emergency contact, but the answer is simple. She raised me, and she is my paternal grandmother. That’s all there is to it. We’ve always had each other since my parents didn’t hang around long enough to see me grow up. My mother found drugs, and my dad… well I know he’s dead. How he died is still a mystery, and no one has seen my mom in twelve years. I suspect that she is dead as well. Through it all, I’ve always had my grandmother. She has always been the one constant in my life, and now, I’m losing her as well. But people don’t live forever, even if we wish they could.

I am now her caregiver. I moved back to my hometown, Juniper, and I’m not so sure that I’m going to stay after she passes. I thought about hiring someone to live with her, but I decided that I could manage on my own. I’m a nurse by trade, so I’m able to do most of the dirty work by myself. I change her, feed her, and bathe her. She’s on hospice now, and the hospice nurse comes by almost everyday to check on us. She’s a sweet woman with perfectly straightened hair and big brown eyes. She always asks me if I’m doing okay, and I always give her the generic “I’m doing fine.” The truth is… watching someone die is draining, and it isn’t like you imagine it. It is quiet, empty, and it has a certain kind of smell. It is a sharp scent, and it doesn’t leave your nose no matter where you go.

My grandmother can’t talk anymore. She mumbles something here and there while she sleeps, and when she wakes up, she stares at the wall. She’s only a feeble shell of who she used to be. The light in her eyes is somewhere else, dulled by her medicine and poisoned by her stroke.

Since I’ve moved back into my childhood home, all I do is clean. I turn on the tv for my grandmother if she is awake, and I get right to it. The house was a wreck when I came back two days before she was supposed to leave the hospital. Apparently, things were not as good as she led me to believe. I had only been away for a year since I finished nursing school and bought my own apartment. Of course, she couldn’t tell me anything now, but from what I can gather… she’d developed some interesting new habits. She’d started hoarding boxes, old cartons, wicker baskets, ill-fitting clothes, and silk flowers. There were bags upon bags of silk flowers, stacked to the ceiling like skyscrapers. I didn’t know that one could purchase so many silk flowers, and I thought I might die after a mountain of them fell on me. I was able to clear a pathway through to the main dining room where her hospice bed was set up, and I’ve been going through room after room and just throwing away and pillaging through her hoard. I bag it up, take it outside, and burn it. None of it is sentimental, and it is all garbage to me. She wasn’t living alone either. She’d picked up some little woodland friends… mice… rats… and from the skeletons I found in one of the bedrooms, I’d a say a family of squirrels was massacred by an avalanche of wicker baskets and boxes.

I just don’t understand. Why did she hide her ailing mental state from me? How could she live like this? She used to be a clean freak. She’d wash a porcelain sink four times until it shined. I should have come back sooner. I’d planned to come this Christmas since I wasn’t scheduled to work. I feel like a failure.

Her house used to be a beautiful bed and breakfast that everyone used to love to stay at. There are six guest bedrooms, and a master suite that always served as our main living space. It takes up the entire top floor of the house. It has its own kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom area. When I was little, I used to sleep with her on the master bed with my favorite stuffed animal. Now, the entire master suite serves as a graveyard for her mounds of trash, decaying woodland friends, and junk. I considered hiring someone to go through this absolute trash heap, but instead, I use it as my therapy. Throwing away the trash, burning it, and taking care of my grandmother gets me through the day. I’m exhausted, but it is better than feeling the horrible ache of grief swelling through my body like a balloon. I’d rather collapse on the couch and pass out than feel a single tinge of bitter sadness creeping up on me. It is easier to push it all away than actually cope. I’m sure that you probably understand… or maybe you don’t, and I’m assuming too much.

The night before my grandmother died she started talking in her sleep very loudly. It was so loud that she woke me up as I laid on the couch beside her bed. Usually she slept soundly, but the last few nights she kept trying to get up. She’d groan and try to lift her body, but that is sometimes a side effect of the morphine, a jarring restlessness. And tonight, it was disturbing pieces and parts of words as she attempted to rise again.

“Gram,” I said, slowly getting up and rubbing my eyes. “Do you need something?”

Her mouth was moving up and down, but no words were coming out. It was just hushed whispers of vowels and consonants. You could hear her tongue and teeth clacking together as she tried to produce audible sounds again. The left side of her face still had a visible droop, and a nasally whistle came through her nose as her poor failing body struggled to speak to me.

I took a deep breath, rubbing through her hair. “Gram, do you want some water?”

She nodded, and I grabbed her cup and her straw. I placed the straw into her mouth, and she swallowed quickly. She smacked her lips together and went back to sleep. I called my friend, Anna, who is a hospice nurse, and she answered, knowing that it was important if I was calling her so late.

“Carrie,” she said quietly. “John is sleeping, so let me leave our bedroom. Are you okay?”

“She keeps talking in her sleep. Is that normal?”

Anna sighed. “Yeah. It is normal with the sleep aids that she is taking. But I asked if you were okay. Are you?”

I sat back down on the couch. “You know that I’m not, but who would be in this situation?”

“Carrie… It is hard. You can call me to talk any time. Do you need help? I can make the drive to you.”

“No,” I replied quickly. “Anna it is such a mess here. I’ve been able to clean out most of the lower level of the house, but the master suite is a nightmare. Besides, I wouldn’t be okay letting you sleep on the other old couch.”

Anna chuckled. “You let me know if you change your mind, okay?”

“I will. Now go on back to bed. You’ve got work tomorrow. Sorry that I woke you up.”

“It’s fine. Goodnight,” she said in a whisper.

“Goodnight.”

I ended the call and sat back into the couch. The room was dark, but moonlight poured in from the windows. I was able to see, so I wasn’t concerned. I titled my head back, and I looked up at the ceiling, watching the shadows of tree branches thumping together as the wind blew outside. A stray branch scraped against the side of the house, and I jumped. I sighed and made a mental note to cut the damn crepe myrtles outside. They had grown wild, sprouting more branches than I had ever seen. They didn’t resemble the perfect pink puff balls along the house that I once remembered. The entire house was no longer the blissful country home that I once remembered. Like my grandmother… it was now only an empty shell of what would have been a once loving home for everyone who needed a warm bed.

I heard a sharp intake of breath, and I turned my gaze back to my grandmother. She began to mumble again. I inched closer to her, smelling the rancid odor of her breath. I knew that smell. It was the smell that only dying people emit. I knew that her time was coming. I leaned my ear closer to her mouth, and I was able to make out three words.

“Feed… the… house.”

“What?” I asked nervously. I held tightly onto the metal rung of her hospice bed. “What do you mean?” My words came out shakily, and I leaned even closer to her.

“The house… needs to be… fed.”

She suddenly grabbed my hand, and her other arm flailed as she tried to grab my hair. Her fingers grazed my cheek, and I tried to pry her hand off of mine. Her fingernails dug into my skin, and her knuckles burned white in the darkness of the room. Her eyes were wide, staring upwards at the ceiling… seeing something that I simply couldn’t. I couldn’t move. I was horrified. I had seen patients die, but none of them looked like this. She looked… scared. Her lips quivered, shaking the little amount of flesh that covered her facial bones. I couldn’t quite decide what she saw, but I was sure that I never wanted to see it either. I was able to rip my hand from her grasp, and I looked down to see purple whelps forming on my skin. She had grabbed me with inhumane strength, and I didn’t understand. Maybe I wouldn’t ever.

One thing was for certain. She wanted her house fed, and I wasn’t sure what that meant.

She died the next day in the early hours. I knew it was coming, and I hated that she left me with such a horrific memory. The funeral was three days later on a Friday. I still had bruises and little red crescent moons from her fingernails on my hand. Everyone in my hometown came. It was the busiest funeral that I had ever witnessed. The mayor came with his wife, and they made what felt like an extreme effort to learn my future plans for my grandmother’s house. The sheriff and his wife came. Old classmates and their parents. It was insane in my opinion. She didn’t know half of these people, and I surely didn’t know them either.

One of my grandmother’s frequent guests at the bed and breakfast came up to me and gave his condolences. He was an older man with greying hair and a thin grey mustache. “You plannin’ to stay here and clean up the place? I think the bed and breakfast deserves a second chance. It has been run by the Clifton family since this town was founded.”

My mouth went dry. “I haven’t really thought that much into it. I’m a nurse, so I figure that I’ll have to sell it.”

His face turned a hot shade of red. “You can’t do that! You don’t know what you are doing. What would your grandmother say?” Spittle shot from his mouth as he continued to fuss. “You simply can’t sell it.”

I stared at him, trying to decide why it bothered him so much. People turned to look at him, hearing his loud voice over the conversations around them. I decided to give him an answer to placate him since I didn’t want him yelling at me during the visitation.

“Mr. Havers… I haven’t made any decisions yet,” I replied lowly. “I’d appreciate it if you’d lower your voice as well. People are staring.”

He looked around, and he smiled. He straightened his suit. “Good… You need to think of Juniper. You are now one of the founding members since your grandmother has passed. It is your responsibility to keep this town thriving. I’m sure that you’ll make the right choice.”

He left quickly, nearly knocking someone over as he hurried away. Everyone stared at him as he left, but they did not seem as shocked as I was. He had always been nice to my grandmother.

I felt my cheeks burn and tears welling up. I forced them down, and I looked around, hoping to spot someone I knew. I needed someone to take my mind off of Mr. Havers. One of the police officers who had come walked to check on me. He looked familiar, but I couldn’t remember how I knew him.

“Are you okay, Carrie?” he asked. He was a younger man with reddish hair and hazel eyes.

“I’m fine. Everyone is acting so crazy today. I just don’t understand,” I whispered.

He shrugged. “Funerals make everyone crazy. My name is Phillip. You might remember me from school. I moved away, but I got a job here when I finished police academy.”

I nodded, remembering the geeky kid who moved away when we were freshman. “Phillip Masterson,” I said, frowning. “Layton Meyers used to pick on you really bad. I remember you. I’m sorry I didn’t intervene to help you.”

“No worries… No one wanted to stand up to him.” Phillip smiled. “Now Layton Meyers is a drunkard and lost his drivers license, so I think I’m safe for now.” He chuckled.

He sat down beside me, drinking a cup of lemonade from the refreshment table. “When did you get back?” he asked.

“About three weeks ago.”

“I started working here about a month ago, so what have you been doing?” he asked, trying to be friendly.

 “I’ve been cleaning out my grandmother’s house and taking care of her. She let it fall into ruin, and truthfully, the whole thing needs to bulldozed.”

I looked out at the crowd of people. They were socializing like this was a family event. “I don’t understand how all of these people are here for the funeral, but no one went over there to check on her. Surely, she had friends who cared enough to drop by. Assholes...” I stopped myself. “I’m sorry. That was mean to say.”

He took a deep breath. “Mean or not… it is the truth. So many people used to go to your grandmother’s bed and breakfast, and the town grew because her incredible gardens brought tourists. I think it’s a shame that none of them bothered to check in on her while you were gone.”

I looked up at him, grateful to have someone who seemed to understand. He stood up, preparing to leave, but I stopped him.

“Phillip, what do you know about the bed and breakfast? My grandmother told me some strange stuff when she was lucid.”

He looked taken aback. “I don't know much,"" he whispered. ""I can grab some records from city hall and bring them by tomorrow. I can also help you clean. I’m off tomorrow if you’d like some help and some company.”

I nodded. “I’d like that very much.”

He smiled. “I’ll bring coffee.” He walked off and headed out the door of the funeral home.

After the funeral ended and she was lowered into her grave, I drove back to my grandmother’s house all alone. I stared out the window, thumbing over the steering wheel. I suddenly noticed how much larger Juniper had grown since I left. Yet the people who had always lived here still remained. I was the only one that seemed to escape. Everywhere around us is farmland and large expanses of thick woods, so Juniper is the only place that many come to for other necessities or entertainment. They finally built a movie theatre, and the old mall closed down. But they were expanding. I could see the shell of new homes and new buildings sprouting up everywhere, and it made me wonder why they were so keen on preserving the now rotting bed and breakfast. I couldn’t help but think about Mr. Havers.

He must know something.

I’m sure of it, and maybe we find out together.

\-Carrie

1qfg92x,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1qfg92x/reduction_schedule_janmar/,Reduction Schedule Jan-Mar,"Ok, the drop from 5-7 cups drip coffee a day (plus cocoa, chocolate, and the occasional energy style drink) to approx 38-45mg was rough, but not nearly as bad as when I tried to drop from 38-8mg (could not handle it popped back up to 38mg). 

I don't want to drag this out too long - but I want to be reasonable with it. The reason I am here in the first place is my ""balls to the wall or dead stop"" production baseline! (Yes, I am working on that lol). 

I have caffeinated electrolytes and a scale that weighs to 0.1gm so it is easy for me to tailor the taper. 

I have been having 38mg caffeine, 3-4 cups instant decaf (Folgers 99.7% caffeine free approx 1-2mg per cup) and I still have chocolate and cocoa daily but not overly (protein bars, a few shakes of cocoa in my Chicory drink). 

I am not trying to have total chocolate abstinence for the rest of my life (not realistic lol) - and I am not too fussed about trace caffeine in things, that's not realistic for me. But decided, intentional reduction IS. 

My main goal is daily reduction of all intentional caffeine - if that makes sense. 

I stopped drinking alcohol completely in October (forever abstinence just for health reasons - since turning 50 I am focusing more on that now). I d/c my low dose Adderall in November. And stopped daily use of single dose Sudafed for allergies in December (trying to find another allergy med that works as well and there just isn't one... so if anyone has any suggestions I am all ears!!) 

Since I seem to be on the Monthly Reduction of Sh\*t In My System Plan - I want to continue the trend. 

The Plan: 

Jan: For the rest of January, I am going to reduce caffeine intake by 0.1gm daily (I already started today) so that puts me off caffeine by (almost) the end of January. 

Feb: I will start reducing my decaf intake during the month: 4 cups daily 1st week, 3 cups daily second week, 2 cups daily 3rd week, 1 cup daily 4th week. 

Mar: Start replacing added cocoa with carob and switch chocolate protein bars to vanilla and berry flavors. 

  
There are a lot of Decaf Veterans and Current Caffeine Warriors on here who are working their own plans - so I thought I'd plunk mine out here too. 

Any thoughts or input is greatly appreciated and good luck to everyone else doing the same! ",2,1768664120.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Sou iniciante no mundo de cafés especiais, até o momento minhas 'ferramentas' são:

\- Filtro Melitta 103;

\- Moedor iCoffee M4 Pro;

\- Pour-over

Como meu primeiro café especial, aproveitei uma promoção e comprei o [kit de cafés excepcionais 85+ da Cafeoteca](https://www.cafeoteca.com.br/produto/colecao-cafes-excepcionais-do-brasil-85-250g-5-origens-1-edicao-limitada-250g-1202), sem nenhum critério específico, só achei que seria bom e gostei da possibildade de provar os vários cafés diferentes do kit. Não me atentei que todos tem uma torra clara.

  
Já devo ter feito umas 5 ou 6 extrações provando alguns dos cafés do kit, mas até agora não consegui sentir a 'doçura intensa' ou o 'açucar mascavo' mencionados nas descrições. Estou ciente de que essa doçura não é igual à de um café com açúcar - e eu nem procuro isso - só gostaria de encontrar uma receita para conseguir uma extração boa.

  
Até o momento, consegui tirar alguns cafés com sabores proveitosos mas todos eles tem uma acidez (na minha opinião) no limite do 'aproveitável', fiz o teste de separar o café em 3 extrações de 100ml e de fato, a primeira e a segunda xícara são, respectivamente, MUITO acída e ácida. A última delas, que eu esperava ser amarga por ter levado bastante tempo para finalizar a extração, era talvez 10% do amargor imaginado (quase imperceptível) e muito pouco ácida.

  
Minha técnica de extração gira em torno de:

\- Pré-infusão: 3x a gramatura dos grãos em agua (20g - 60ml) por 20-45s (depende da moagem);

\- Primeiro ataque: \~100ml, dependendo da moagem leva de 30-90 segundos

\- Segundo ataque: \~100ml, dependendo da moagem leva de 40-120 segundos

  
Qual é a melhor forma de reduzir essa acidez? Ela é intrínseca do café de torra clara? O problema é o meu paladar 'de iniciante'? Aceito indicações de cafés mais fáceis de sentir as notas doces.

*The absence of enchantment is an appalling sort of thing*, Oliver Milligan thought, couch-embedded, facing a wall-mounted television from which bland sitcom antics spilled. *Laughter rings hollow. Colors collapse into drabness. Elaborately prepared dinners are as dust to one’s tongue. Holidays—even Halloween, once so spine-chillingly joyous—devolve to empty pomp. Even vacations seem dull routine.* 

 

What remained of a Hungry-Man dinner sat beside him. An unopened Budweiser can chilled his inner thighs. Underfoot, the beige carpet seemed dandruffy. Cobwebs bestrew the ceiling corners with no arachnids in sight. His refrigerator hummed malignantly. Something was wrong with the freezer’s fan motor. 

 

A strange sort of notion arrived: his cramped studio apartment was slowly digesting him. 

 

Years prior, he’d possessed purpose, not merely an occupation. He’d had companions in those days, closer than blood kin.

 

Traveling the United States with seven likeminded individuals, Oliver had encountered people from all walks of life. So too had he experienced nature in its myriad variations, from scorching, arid Arizona Augusts to bone-numbing Minnesota Decembers. He’d witnessed hurricanes and flash floods, felt earthquakes and thunderclaps, and ogled bleeding-highlighter auroras, taking a piece of each into his essence.

 

Unquestioningly, he’d followed the instructions of the most charismatic man he’d ever known, a visionary who’d sculpted masterpieces from the humdrum, a true urban legend. The Hallowfiend was that man’s assumed moniker, an allusion to countless All Hallows’ Eve slaughters. 

 

Only Oliver and the killer’s other six helpers, who’d known him since childhood, knew of the Hallowfiend’s birth name and other fake ID aliases. Only they had ingested psychedelics and amphetamines to amplify his orations. Only they were permitted to wear costumes that matched the Hallowfiend’s absolute favorite raiment: skeleton masks and sweat suits, Day-Glo orange all over. 

 

Short-lived occupations, generally of the menial sort, had filled their mornings and afternoons. Plans and preparations, meetings and reconnaissance, had swallowed their evenings. And when the thirty-first of October rolled around with its fanged sickle grin, when children donned costumes and paraded at twilight, when sugar rushes sped speeches and footfalls, when horror flick marathons reached their crescendos, the Hallowfiend and his helpers glutted their pumpkin deity with sufferers’ souls. 

 

Tableaus built of posed cadavers echoed muted shrieks and pleadings. Cops and FBI agents, too soul sick to spend any more time attempting to fathom the motives of such artful slaughter, retired from duty early. News cameras crowded funerals to enshrine mourners’ tears. 

 

Though, generally, the Hallowfiend would select a favorite final victim for prolonged, private attentions, to last him until November’s dawning, the rest of the night’s fatalities were shared with his acolytes. Over the years, Oliver’s own hands had released gallons of gore, had throttled necks purple and thumb-pressed eyes into mucky implosions. Orgasmic waves of unbounded sensation washed away morality’s hollow echo, and he howled and he slavered, licked his chops and pranced madly. It was better than copulation, more refreshing than summer rain. It was, indeed, everything he’d ever desired.

 

Then he went and got himself arrested.

 

They were in Vermont at the time, Essex Junction to be exact. Working as a UPS deliveryman, the Hallowfiend learned of a fire-damaged, abandoned Marion Avenue townhouse. Its owner, Elgin Morse, rather than renovate or demolish the structure, had decreed that the property be left alone, save for the last day of October, when it was transformed into a haunted attraction to raise money for local charities. 

 

The Morse House tradition was entering its fourth year, and was quite popular with the villagers. Children curved their trick-or-treating treks toward it. Their elders chugged liquor to render its frights more convulsive. Volunteers decorated the place and skulked all throughout it, dressed in ghoul costumes, occasionally leaping from the shadows to playfully seize the unwary. Of course, the Hallowfiend and his helpers had to give it a look-see. 

 

The fellow in charge of the home haunt—restaurateur/scoutmaster/all-around great guy Bennie Philipse—once contacted, agreed to give the Hallowfiend and his helpers a tour of the premises, two weeks prior to its seasonal unveiling. They wished to volunteer and, in fact, had worked at haunted attractions all across the United States, and were chock-full of strategies to make the Morse House experience more thrilling, they’d assured him.

 

“Just as long as it’s child-friendly,” was Bennie’s rejoinder. He then recited the address from memory and added, “Meet me there this evening; let’s say around six.”

 

Though the passing of years had dimmed many of his memories, Oliver recalled his Morse House arrival with crystal clarity: the air’s invigorating crispness, the lawns carpeted with orange and yellow leaves, the strangers waving from sidewalks, the sense that there was absolutely no better place on Earth to be at that moment. 

 

Many decorations were already on display. Elaborately carved jack-o'-lanterns, that perennial favorite, flanked the front entrance. Soon, candlelight would spill through their features to delineate countenances cronish, bestial and demonic. Dark silhouettes occupied every window: ghosts, witches and arachnids. A half-dozen ventriloquist’s dummies had been nailed to the roof, posed so that they appeared to be climbing. 

 

Faux cemetery gates—built of painted foam, PVC and plywood—enclosed the tombstone-loaded front lawn, so that one could only approach the residence via its asphalt driveway. In the absolute center of that driveway, Bennie Philipse awaited them. A muscular sort of fellow, entirely bald, tieless in a cotton sateen suit, he sipped iced coffee and grinned to see the Hallowfiend and his entourage. A round of handshakes ensued, and then he led them indoors. 

 

Slipping into the role of a tour guide, Bennie trumpeted, “Okay, this here’s the living room. See that burnt up couch over there? We kept the home’s original, ruined furniture. Everything is streaked with soot here, you’ll notice, including most of this place’s walls and cupboards. See those arms bursting out from the wall? Animatronic. Once we turn the things on, they’ll be waving all around. We’ll have fog machines and strobe lights, a real assault on the senses. Here’s the dining room. See those funhouse mirrors? Cool, right? Which leads us to the kitchen. See the fake brains in the open freezer, the eyeballs and severed hands in the fridge? They were props in the movie *The Toymaker’s Lament*. We got ’em dirt-cheap off of eBay. I never saw that film myself, but it’s supposed to be pretty gory. 

 

“Okay, now follow me upstairs. Here we are. We’ll have fake blood filling the sinks, toilets and bathtubs. Volunteers made-up to look like zombies will be lying on those scorched beds. When people enter the room, they’ll jump up and lunge at ’em. No genital groping, though. Ain’t no perverts amongst us. What else? Oh, we’ll have a fake severed head spinning around in the washing machine, plus whatever our volunteers come up with in the days leading up to Halloween. You fellas mentioned that you have some ideas, which you’re more than welcome to run by me.” 

 

Thus the Hallowfiend, in his respectable guise, his false identity of Bartholomew Martin, began to voice suggestions, speaking of air blasters that froze visitors in their tracks and scent dispensers that sped footsteps with the odors of putrescence. He spoke of music box melodies that had reportedly driven listeners mad, recordings of which he’d attained at estate sales. The skeletons of impossible creatures he could attain, he claimed. Occult symbols he could replicate, characters that repelled prolonged gazes. A séance he could fake, assuming the role of a trance medium. Even a false ceiling could be constructed, whose slow descent would force upper floor visitors to drop to their hands and knees and crawl back to the staircase. When he’d hooked Bennie good, really seized the man’s interest, the Hallowfiend delivered his speech’s denouement. 

 

“There’s this new type of dummy,” he claimed, “terrifying as all get-out, yet child-friendly. They blink and they cry, flare their nostrils, sometimes moan. They’re so realistically designed that you expect them to leap to their feet, or at least flex their arms. But they just stare into space. I tell you, it’s unnerving.”

 

“What, like Frankenstein monsters and vampires?” asked Bennie. “Swamp creatures and snake women, maybe?”

 

“No sirree,” said the Hallowfiend. “They look just like ordinary people, not even in costume. That’s what makes them so frightening, you see. Your guests will assume that the dummies are, in fact, fellow visitors, ones paralyzed by the horror of what they’d encountered. I tell you, it’ll amplify their dread a thousandfold.”

 

Bennie scratched his chin. “Hmm,” he said. “That sounds interesting, certainly, but also quite expensive. We’ve already spent most of this year’s budget.”

 

“Not a problem at all,” the Hallowfiend assured him. “My friends and I, well, we’ve enjoyed our time in Essex Junction so immensely, that it would be our absolute pleasure to take care of everything: procurement, costs, transportation and setup. Everyone’s been so kind to us here, it’s the least we can do.”

 

Oh, how Bennie grinned to hear that. He felt giddy, nearly childish, at the prospect of his haunted attraction’s climax. “Well, if it’s no trouble for you fellas…” 

 

“Not a problem at all,” said the Hallowfiend. 

 

A second round of handshakes ensued; an agreement was cemented. 

 

Over the next few nights, discreetly, the Hallowfiend and his helpers outlined the truth of their All Hallows’ Eve festivities. Sure, they’d construct a false ceiling, and provide scent dispensers, air blasters, strange skeletons, occult symbols, and disturbing melodies as promised, but the night’s true jubilation would lie in their “dummies.”

 

Having posed as a marine biologist some years previous, the Hallowfiend had acquired samples of *Takifugu rubripes* tetrodotoxin, which he’d saved for a special occasion. Forced to ingest a predetermined amount of that substance—dictated by their age, weight, and general health—a victim would become a living doll for up to twenty-four hours. First their face would numb over, and they’d feel as if they’d escaped gravity. They’d perspire, vomit and shit; they’d forget how to speak. As the tetrodotoxin’s bodily dominance grew, they’d become entirely paralyzed, their heartbeat and respiration abnormal, with a coma and cardiac arrest looming, which would sweep their soul from their body. 

 

Each of the Hallowfiend’s helpers, Oliver included, was assigned a task. Each was to kidnap an out-of-towner, someone who wouldn’t be recognized, and bring them to the Hallowfiend for their dose of tetrodotoxin. Once the second stage effects arrived, and they were entirely paralyzed, the victims would be transported to the Morse House to act as living props. Costumed kids and adults would parade past them, shuddering at their slack faces, as the “dummies” slipped closer and closer towards death. 

 

Of course, the Hallowfiend and his helpers couldn’t allow them to reach their comas. Indeed, once the Morse House was closed for the year, and they’d killed Bennie Philipse so as to have the place to themselves, they would gift each paralyzed sufferer with slow torture. Though their victims would be beyond any physical agony at that point, the psychological horror of witnessing one’s own organs unspooling, of pliers pushed between their lips to yank their teeth from their gums, of an eye yanked from its socket to better regard its twin oculus, why, that would certainly be worth savoring.

 

By the time that Halloween rolled around, all of their Morse House additions were accomplished, save for the “dummies”, which they assured Bennie would be arriving that evening. Each of the Hallowfiend’s helpers hit the road solo, to abduct a suitable person. 

 

Oliver found himself a short drive away, in the city of Burlington, early in the a.m., cruising the streets in his fuel-leaking Ford Pinto. Hoping to spy a lone woman or child with no witnesses around, with a bottle of chloroform and a rag ’neath his seat, he cruised past bars and schools, neighborhoods and shopping centers, to no avail. At last, when nearly two hours had elapsed, frustrated, he hollered at a pair of dog walkers, “Hey, where’s a good place to go hiking around here?”

 

“You can’t beat the Loop Trail at Red Rocks Park,” a grey-goateed gent answered, his rhythmic stride unbroken. Even when asked for directions, which he aptly provided, he and his female companion kept their paces unvarying, as a pair of Australian Terriers contentedly trotted afore them. 

 

A short time later, Oliver pulled into a parking lot. It yet being early morning, only three other vehicles met his sight, with no owners present. “This might just work,” he muttered, catching a whiff of his own coffee breath. He had options to weigh, which shaped his thoughts thusly: *Should I make my way down to the bay’s rocky shoreline, or wander the fringes of the loop trail, concealed by pines and hemlocks? Or should I save my legs the trouble and remain in my car until I sight a lone visitor? If I wait for too long, this park may become crowded. I suppose I’ll try the shore first. Perhaps luck is with me.*

 

And when he followed the gentle susurration of the bay’s tranquil blue water, upon which the reflected morning clouds seemed pallid, rippling islands, and spotted a middle-aged woman in a folding chair—reading a romance fiction paperback, oblivious to all else—it seemed that the pumpkin-faced deity was smiling upon Oliver. She had dressed for the weather: fleece jacket, sweatpants and Ugg boots. Auburn locks in need of a brushing spilled down her broad back. 

 

The woman cleared her throat and turned a page, as he crept up behind her. From Oliver’s back pocket came the chloroform rag, wafting sweet pungency. 

 

In that exalted moment, that sublime span of seconds, it seemed that an entire planet had been sculpted to encompass just the two of them, as if they’d become templates for all future life forms. His free hand seized her shoulder. His rag stifled her scream. She moaned and she thrashed—which seemed more of a slow dance to his fevered mind—for a while, attempting to stand and flee, until unconsciousness claimed her and she tumbled from her chair. Oliver tossed his rag into the bay and, with more exertion than he’d anticipated, hefted the gal up over his shoulder and lurched them back to the parking lot.  

 

“Damnation,” he muttered, spotting a pair of fresh arrivals. Emerging from a blue BMW, surging with mid-thirties vitality, were two square-jawed bodybuilder types: twins, with matching crew cuts and Nike gear. 

 

Slipping into a ruse, threading his words with faux friendliness, Oliver blurted, “Hey there, fellas. My wife had too many morning mimosas and is now dead to the world. We’re heading home for Tylenol and much bed rest, of course.”

 

“Wife, huh?” the leftward man said. “I know that chick. She owns that hole in the wall candle shop my girlfriend drags me into sometimes. Velma Mapplethorpe is her name…and she’s an obvious lesbian.”

 

“Why don’t you set the nice lady down?” the rightward twin asked, squinting into the sun, dragging a cellphone from his pocket. “We’ll call the police and let them sort this out.” When Oliver failed to respond, he added, “Nobody needs to get hurt here.”

 

Oliver weighed his options for a moment, and then dropped Velma to the pavement, so as to sprint to his car. Unfortunately, as he was fumbling his keys from his pocket, a flying kick met his thigh, sending him into his driver’s side door, cratering it. As he attempted to regain his footing, alternate fists met his face. Constellations swam across his vision, and then were swallowed by a black void. 

 

By the time that Oliver came to, a pair of officers had arrived to arrest him. The woman he’d nearly abducted had regained consciousness as well. Too woozy to stand, she trembled and vomited. *You’d have make such a great dummy*, Oliver thought, as handcuffs found his wrists and he was manhandled into the back of a police cruiser. 

 

A search of Oliver’s car uncovered his chloroform bottle. That, plus the testimony of Miss Mapplethorpe and her rescuers, resulted in Oliver being convicted of attempted abduction, a third-degree felony. With no prior convictions on his record—and no way for the prosecution to prove that his motives were sexual, which they weren’t—he was sentenced to three years at Northwest State Correctional Facility. 

 

Slowly did those years pass. For entertainment, he relied on the prison’s gymnasium, wherein he discovered a love of volleyball, and its library. He kept a pack of playing cards in his cell, for sporadic games of solitaire, and a head full of memories to warm him at night. 

 

Throughout those thirty-six months, not a single visitor arrived to commiserate with Oliver. Never did he learn of the Hallowfiend’s Morse House murders. His fellow inmates left him alone, mostly, though he was assaulted a few times in the outdoors recreation yard, resulting in nothing more severe than mild contusions and a few stitches. 

 

Post-release, he attempted to contact the Hallowfiend, but the killer and his helpers had, of course, absconded from Essex Junction. Strangers now occupied their last known residences. Their cellphone numbers were all out of service. There was no P.O. box that Oliver could write to. Most likely, the seven had moved on to another state entirely.

 

Indeed, Oliver’s time in prison had left him shunned by his ex-companions. The Hallowfiend couldn’t risk being associated with a known felon, after all; his deathly efforts were far too important. Even if Oliver attained a fake name, and identification to go along with it, his fingerprints and mug shot were in the system, and could be accessed by any cop at any time. 

 

Still, he chafed at abandonment. As an accomplice to many autumnal atrocities, he’d reveled in bloodletting, in the ear-splitting shrieks of supernal sufferers, in the slackening of faces as life ebbed away. He’d seen nightmares made corporeal, watched religious beliefs evaporate. He’d seen pumpkin fire gleaming in sheens of snot, sweat and tears.

 

Left to his own devices, murder hardly seemed worth the effort. Pitiable it was, like post-breakup masturbation. No great idea man he, to Oliver, plotting an original, aesthetic murder was nonviable. Either he’d settle for knifings, shootings, and strangulations like a dullard, or he’d be reduced to duplicating the Hallowfiend’s greatest hits. Would the Hallowfiend even abide a copycat killer? Would his pumpkin-faced deity? 

 

The only option, it seemed, was for Oliver to move on, to stop pining away for the Hallowfiend’s unique brand of predations and attempt to fashion a new life for himself. He needed a fresh setting, the antithesis of the spooky, secluded ambiance that the Hallowfiend cultivated. He needed year-round warmth and sunshine, palm trees and noisy neighbors. He needed chain stores and superchurches, so comfortably bland. He needed to socialize without ulterior motives. To that end, he bent his trajectory westward, toward Southern California. 

 

Unable to decide between the cities of San Diego and Los Angeles, he settled for Oceanside, a site of 42.2 square miles situated between them. 

 

Finding an apartment was easy; acquiring gainful employment wasn’t. After weeks of fruitless searching, he learned that the best an ex-con could do was land a position at Vanillagan’s Island, an ice cream parlor off of South Coast Highway. Working as an ice cream server/cashier alongside pimple-faced teenagers who mocked him when they believed him out of earshot, he donned his work uniform—white bucket hat, Hawaiian shirt, khaki shorts and sandals—day after day, and struggled to maintain a friendly face and vocal tone. Working full-time, he covered his rent and other expenses, but just barely. 

 

Neither ugly nor handsome enough to draw the ire of Oceanside’s average meathead, Oliver was the sort of fellow one’s gaze slid right over. Paunchy, not fat, balding with a bad combover, thin-lipped and weak-chinned, somewhat slight in stature, he could blend into any crowd with ease, but romance eluded him. 

 

Though he’d yet to make any new friends, he attained hollow satisfaction by making small talk with the ice cream parlor’s customers, and also with the grocery clerks and cashiers he encountered on his weekly shopping trips. Attempting to invite his next-door neighbors, a young Hispanic couple, over for a drink, he’d had to provide them with a rain check, which they seemed disinclined to use. 

 

Sometimes he drove to Barnes & Noble and read magazines from cover to cover, free of charge. Other times he strolled the Oceanside Strand, with sand and waves beside him. Meeting the eyes of scantily clad locals and tourists, seeking some indefinable quality therein, he found only indifference. When he could afford the expense, he attended the cinema solo, to experience the latest blockbusters. Days defined by dull routines flowed into weeks and months, leading to his current evening, nigh identical to those preceding it. 

 

He switched off the television and returned his unopened beer can to the fridge. The trash bag beneath his sink swallowed his Hungry-Man dinner remnants. 

 

Oliver hit the shower for a quick scrub down, and then brushed his teeth before a fogged mirror. Garbed in only a pair of flannel boxer shorts, he climbed into bed. Slowly arrived slumber. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Hours later, just before dawn, he blinked his way into consciousness. “Guh…what time is it?” he murmured. By the quality of the darkness, he knew that his cellphone alarm wouldn’t be jangling for a while, with its usual get-ready-for-work urgency. What had awoken him? He recollected no dreams. 

 

*“Nearly 5 a.m., man,”* answered a youthful voice, female, its tone quite sardonic. 

 

Having, naturally, expected no response, Oliver jolted. Swiveling his regard toward the intruder, he sighted a phenomenon most outré. It was as if the darkness wore a young woman, a high school aged female whose features were discernible, though translucent. Her knit wool beanie was white, her black sweatshirt dark and bulky. Beneath them, capri jeans tapered down to a pair of white-with-black-stripes Adidas sneakers. 

 

*A ghost!* Oliver realized. *Indeed, I’ve long wondered if they existed.* Studying her weary-yet-defiant features, half-convinced that his awakening had been false and he was lodged within a strange dream, he wondered aloud, “Did I…kill you? Did the Hallowfiend?”

 

Scrunching her face, turning a pair of palms ceilingward—the better to underline her disdain—she answered, *“Hallowfiend? What the hell is that…some kind of shitty John Carpenter rip-off? And you’re asking if you killed me? You? So, what, you’re some kinda murderer? Jesus fuck, sir, has everybody on Earth gone psychotic? What happened to love for your fellow man and all of that bullshit?”*

 

She was speaking too fast for him; it felt as if Oliver’s head was spinning. The poltergeist’s intentions, if she even possessed any, were a mystery. She seemed beyond caring if her appearance frightened him. 

 

Oliver’s mouth moved for some time before words emerged from it. “A ghost…you’re actually a ghost?” he said. 

 

*“No shit, genius. What tipped you off? The fact that I’m see-through, maybe? At any rate, any self-respecting lady would have to be dead to hang around this place, with your laid-off crossing guard-lookin’ ass. Have you ever heard of decorating? Shit, man, buy a poster or a painting, or something.”*

 

Ignoring her lambasting, Oliver put the back of his hand to his forehead to see if he had a fever. Though his flesh was quite clammy, its temperature was normal. “Why are you here?” he asked. 

 

*“Oh, like I had a choice in the matter,”* answered the specter, most bitterly. 

 

“Did you die here? Suicide, maybe? Slit your wrists in the bathtub? Chug a bottle of sleeping pills? Hang yourself from…somewhere? If so, no one said a word to me about it.”

 

*“Suicide? Don’t insult me, man. My death—not that it’s any of your business—happened in a loony bin. Get that look off your face. Yeah, I can see you in the dark; ghosts have great night vision. Anyhoo, I wasn’t a patient at Milford Asylum, my sister was. My parents and I were just visiting, being supportive or whatever. But when we got there, damn near everyone in that place was already dead. And their ghosts, man, tore us the fuck apart. Hey, what’s your name, anyway?”*

 

“Uh, Oliver. Oliver Milligan.”

 

*“Well, Mr. Milligan, you wanted to know why I’m here. Believe me, pal, I’d just as soon shuffle off to the afterlife. But there’s this entity, see, wearing some old bitch named Martha. She won’t let us—the other ghosts from the asylum and me, plus some others—leave this fucked-up planet. We’re nothing but pets to her, wearing invisible leashes. Wherever Martha goes, we’ve gotta follow, and the entity just keeps collecting more spirits.”*

 

With a sinking feeling in his stomach, Oliver said, “A ghost collector, huh. And what does the entity plan to do with her specters?”

 

*“Oh, more death and mayhem, I guess. Personally, I think she wants every single human on Earth dead.”*

 

Oliver’s fight or flight response revved its engines. “So, I guess you’re here to kill me,” he snarled, wondering how one might wound a ghost.

 

*“No, Mr. Milligan, not me…not if I don’t have to. My parents and I died sane, and aren’t trying to harm anyone. But we’re given so little time in which to manifest ourselves—to be seen, to be heard—I thought that it might be cool to hang out with you for a minute…you know, before the other ghosts kill you horribly and make you one of us.”*

 

“Other ghosts?” Oliver swept his head from side to side, sighting only ebon nullity. 

 

*“Yeah, man, I’m sorry. Your life, just like everyone else’s, has always been a joke, and you just went and set up its punchline.”*

 

He heard the click of a turned lock, the creaking of door hinges. Limned by the flickering corridor lighting, a figure stood, swaying on her feet, tangible though emaciated. Lengthy were her black locks; deeply sunken were her malicious peepers. Entirely absent of emotion was her slack face, from which speech arrived, though her lips were unmoving. 

 

*“A most excellent addition to my menagerie you shall be,”* said a parched, ragged whisper, which yet struck Oliver’s tympanic membrane with the force of a sonic boom. 

 

Oliver noticed his apartment’s temperature plummeting. Shivering, rubbing his arms beneath the covers, he managed to say, “So, are you this Martha I’ve heard so much about…or, more specifically, the entity wearing her? Your little friend over here”—he gesticulated toward where the spectral teenager had been, but she’d vanished the second his eyes left her—“told me all about you.”

 

*“I am what remains of the agonized once their spirits dissolve. I am vengeful wrath embodied, built on the recollections of sufferers. I am the dark reflection of humanity, here to end you all.”*

 

“Uh…I’ll take that as an affirmative.”

 

Still, the possessed woman made no effort to enter his apartment. *Does she have to be invited inside like a vampire?* Oliver wondered. *Will she flee before daylight? Her host seems so fragile, swaying there in the doorway, half-dead. Perhaps I can kill the poor bitch and end this nightmare.*

 

He owned no firearms, but kept a drawer full of cutlery, wherein sharp Ginsu knives awaited. Could he stab Martha in the heart before her possessor sent a ghost horde against him? Preparing to leap from his bed to attempt exactly that, he was startled by what felt like hundreds of fingers crawling along his legs and arms, as if they’d emerged from his mattress. Sliding through his little hairs, conjuring goosebumps, they segued to scratching. Thin rills of blood spilled from shallow scrapes; flesh ribbons curled away. Attempting to escape, Oliver found his wrist and ankles seized. 

 

Only then did his restrainers’ controlling entity enter the apartment. So soft of step that she seemed to be gliding, Martha pushed the door closed behind her, returning all to darkness. Oliver heard box springs creaking, felt a somewhat negligible weight settle beside him. Carrion breath scorched his nostrils, upon which rode the words, *“Every bit of suffering that you have meted out over your life span shades your aura, a topography of self-damnation. Before I add your specter to my flock, it amuses me to reciprocate those tortures.”*

 

Oliver found his lips pried apart, so vigorously that his mouth corners tore, parting each cheek halfway to the ear. One by one, slowly, lithe digits yanked his teeth from his gums and tossed them against the kitchen stove: *plink, plink, plink*. Iron fists crumpled his genitals, and then wrenched them away. Even as Oliver shrieked for their loss, his left eye was gouged out, then his right. Next, ghosts peeled away each and every one of his fingernails and toenails, which trailed little flesh streamers.

 

Humorlessly, Martha Drexel’s possessor giggled, as if to accentuate Oliver’s discomfort. The sound of it was cut off for him, abruptly, when lengthy fingers breached his ears and punctured his eardrums. Bleeding from what felt like hundreds of wounds, he might have wished for death, were that an escape.

 

In a hellish parody of lovemaking, Martha’s withered form then crawled atop him. Straddling him as he bucked and shuddered, she leaned down to lick perspiration from his forehead. Apparently satisfied that he’d been properly seasoned, she, with surprising strength, began to gnaw through his throat. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Life ebbed, as did his agony. Oliver’s mangled form became little more than old clothing to be sloughed away. Lighter than he’d ever felt before, he began drifting upward, out of the harsh, aching confines of corporeal existence, toward the beckoning afterlife that awaited him in the cosmos. Would forgiveness be found there, prior to dissolution?

 

His translucent skull breached the ceiling. A starfield filled his vision. Constellations he’d known since childhood seemed on the verge of metamorphoses. Amidst them, the moon, waning gibbous, might have been a mirror reflecting half-formed physiognomies. The sounds of early morning traffic—engines vrooming, brakes screeching, horns sporadically honking—and the hoarse coughing of nearby tweakers were subsumed by a celestial orchestration. 

 

Yet ascending, Oliver permitted himself to feel hopeful. No hell awaited subterraneously to scald him with undying flames. No Satan would flick a forked tongue to remind him of his misdeeds. 

 

Then, suddenly, frigid tendrils encircled his spectral waist to terminate his journey. *“Damnation,”* he whispered. *“I’m to be punished after all.”* 

 

Awash in the elated uncertainty of his demise, he’d forgotten his visitor’s tale of beyond-death enslavement. Losing sight of the cosmos, he unwillingly returned to his apartment’s weighted gloom. The dead teenager had been truthful. Ghosts did have excellent night vision. Lamps, furniture, appliances, even wall sockets—all were revealed to him. 

 

Awkwardly sprawled across his bed, almost as if disjointed, the possessed woman regarded him, vacantly. Tendrils of shadow undulated their way through her hospital gown, darker even than the surrounding darkness. Into Oliver’s spiritual orifices they surged, tugging his malleable ghost form inside out and compacting it. 

 

Downward he traveled, into the emaciated woman’s begrimed body, into the howling deep freeze therein, to be stored with the rest of her enslaved specters.",1,1768663885.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

*The absence of enchantment is an appalling sort of thing*, Oliver Milligan thought, couch-embedded, facing a wall-mounted television from which bland sitcom antics spilled. *Laughter rings hollow. Colors collapse into drabness. Elaborately prepared dinners are as dust to one’s tongue. Holidays—even Halloween, once so spine-chillingly joyous—devolve to empty pomp. Even vacations seem dull routine.* 

 

What remained of a Hungry-Man dinner sat beside him. An unopened Budweiser can chilled his inner thighs. Underfoot, the beige carpet seemed dandruffy. Cobwebs bestrew the ceiling corners with no arachnids in sight. His refrigerator hummed malignantly. Something was wrong with the freezer’s fan motor. 

 

A strange sort of notion arrived: his cramped studio apartment was slowly digesting him. 

 

Years prior, he’d possessed purpose, not merely an occupation. He’d had companions in those days, closer than blood kin.

 

Traveling the United States with seven likeminded individuals, Oliver had encountered people from all walks of life. So too had he experienced nature in its myriad variations, from scorching, arid Arizona Augusts to bone-numbing Minnesota Decembers. He’d witnessed hurricanes and flash floods, felt earthquakes and thunderclaps, and ogled bleeding-highlighter auroras, taking a piece of each into his essence.

 

Unquestioningly, he’d followed the instructions of the most charismatic man he’d ever known, a visionary who’d sculpted masterpieces from the humdrum, a true urban legend. The Hallowfiend was that man’s assumed moniker, an allusion to countless All Hallows’ Eve slaughters. 

 

Only Oliver and the killer’s other six helpers, who’d known him since childhood, knew of the Hallowfiend’s birth name and other fake ID aliases. Only they had ingested psychedelics and amphetamines to amplify his orations. Only they were permitted to wear costumes that matched the Hallowfiend’s absolute favorite raiment: skeleton masks and sweat suits, Day-Glo orange all over. 

 

Short-lived occupations, generally of the menial sort, had filled their mornings and afternoons. Plans and preparations, meetings and reconnaissance, had swallowed their evenings. And when the thirty-first of October rolled around with its fanged sickle grin, when children donned costumes and paraded at twilight, when sugar rushes sped speeches and footfalls, when horror flick marathons reached their crescendos, the Hallowfiend and his helpers glutted their pumpkin deity with sufferers’ souls. 

 

Tableaus built of posed cadavers echoed muted shrieks and pleadings. Cops and FBI agents, too soul sick to spend any more time attempting to fathom the motives of such artful slaughter, retired from duty early. News cameras crowded funerals to enshrine mourners’ tears. 

 

Though, generally, the Hallowfiend would select a favorite final victim for prolonged, private attentions, to last him until November’s dawning, the rest of the night’s fatalities were shared with his acolytes. Over the years, Oliver’s own hands had released gallons of gore, had throttled necks purple and thumb-pressed eyes into mucky implosions. Orgasmic waves of unbounded sensation washed away morality’s hollow echo, and he howled and he slavered, licked his chops and pranced madly. It was better than copulation, more refreshing than summer rain. It was, indeed, everything he’d ever desired.

 

Then he went and got himself arrested.

 

They were in Vermont at the time, Essex Junction to be exact. Working as a UPS deliveryman, the Hallowfiend learned of a fire-damaged, abandoned Marion Avenue townhouse. Its owner, Elgin Morse, rather than renovate or demolish the structure, had decreed that the property be left alone, save for the last day of October, when it was transformed into a haunted attraction to raise money for local charities. 

 

The Morse House tradition was entering its fourth year, and was quite popular with the villagers. Children curved their trick-or-treating treks toward it. Their elders chugged liquor to render its frights more convulsive. Volunteers decorated the place and skulked all throughout it, dressed in ghoul costumes, occasionally leaping from the shadows to playfully seize the unwary. Of course, the Hallowfiend and his helpers had to give it a look-see. 

 

The fellow in charge of the home haunt—restaurateur/scoutmaster/all-around great guy Bennie Philipse—once contacted, agreed to give the Hallowfiend and his helpers a tour of the premises, two weeks prior to its seasonal unveiling. They wished to volunteer and, in fact, had worked at haunted attractions all across the United States, and were chock-full of strategies to make the Morse House experience more thrilling, they’d assured him.

 

“Just as long as it’s child-friendly,” was Bennie’s rejoinder. He then recited the address from memory and added, “Meet me there this evening; let’s say around six.”

 

Though the passing of years had dimmed many of his memories, Oliver recalled his Morse House arrival with crystal clarity: the air’s invigorating crispness, the lawns carpeted with orange and yellow leaves, the strangers waving from sidewalks, the sense that there was absolutely no better place on Earth to be at that moment. 

 

Many decorations were already on display. Elaborately carved jack-o'-lanterns, that perennial favorite, flanked the front entrance. Soon, candlelight would spill through their features to delineate countenances cronish, bestial and demonic. Dark silhouettes occupied every window: ghosts, witches and arachnids. A half-dozen ventriloquist’s dummies had been nailed to the roof, posed so that they appeared to be climbing. 

 

Faux cemetery gates—built of painted foam, PVC and plywood—enclosed the tombstone-loaded front lawn, so that one could only approach the residence via its asphalt driveway. In the absolute center of that driveway, Bennie Philipse awaited them. A muscular sort of fellow, entirely bald, tieless in a cotton sateen suit, he sipped iced coffee and grinned to see the Hallowfiend and his entourage. A round of handshakes ensued, and then he led them indoors. 

 

Slipping into the role of a tour guide, Bennie trumpeted, “Okay, this here’s the living room. See that burnt up couch over there? We kept the home’s original, ruined furniture. Everything is streaked with soot here, you’ll notice, including most of this place’s walls and cupboards. See those arms bursting out from the wall? Animatronic. Once we turn the things on, they’ll be waving all around. We’ll have fog machines and strobe lights, a real assault on the senses. Here’s the dining room. See those funhouse mirrors? Cool, right? Which leads us to the kitchen. See the fake brains in the open freezer, the eyeballs and severed hands in the fridge? They were props in the movie *The Toymaker’s Lament*. We got ’em dirt-cheap off of eBay. I never saw that film myself, but it’s supposed to be pretty gory. 

 

“Okay, now follow me upstairs. Here we are. We’ll have fake blood filling the sinks, toilets and bathtubs. Volunteers made-up to look like zombies will be lying on those scorched beds. When people enter the room, they’ll jump up and lunge at ’em. No genital groping, though. Ain’t no perverts amongst us. What else? Oh, we’ll have a fake severed head spinning around in the washing machine, plus whatever our volunteers come up with in the days leading up to Halloween. You fellas mentioned that you have some ideas, which you’re more than welcome to run by me.” 

 

Thus the Hallowfiend, in his respectable guise, his false identity of Bartholomew Martin, began to voice suggestions, speaking of air blasters that froze visitors in their tracks and scent dispensers that sped footsteps with the odors of putrescence. He spoke of music box melodies that had reportedly driven listeners mad, recordings of which he’d attained at estate sales. The skeletons of impossible creatures he could attain, he claimed. Occult symbols he could replicate, characters that repelled prolonged gazes. A séance he could fake, assuming the role of a trance medium. Even a false ceiling could be constructed, whose slow descent would force upper floor visitors to drop to their hands and knees and crawl back to the staircase. When he’d hooked Bennie good, really seized the man’s interest, the Hallowfiend delivered his speech’s denouement. 

 

“There’s this new type of dummy,” he claimed, “terrifying as all get-out, yet child-friendly. They blink and they cry, flare their nostrils, sometimes moan. They’re so realistically designed that you expect them to leap to their feet, or at least flex their arms. But they just stare into space. I tell you, it’s unnerving.”

 

“What, like Frankenstein monsters and vampires?” asked Bennie. “Swamp creatures and snake women, maybe?”

 

“No sirree,” said the Hallowfiend. “They look just like ordinary people, not even in costume. That’s what makes them so frightening, you see. Your guests will assume that the dummies are, in fact, fellow visitors, ones paralyzed by the horror of what they’d encountered. I tell you, it’ll amplify their dread a thousandfold.”

 

Bennie scratched his chin. “Hmm,” he said. “That sounds interesting, certainly, but also quite expensive. We’ve already spent most of this year’s budget.”

 

“Not a problem at all,” the Hallowfiend assured him. “My friends and I, well, we’ve enjoyed our time in Essex Junction so immensely, that it would be our absolute pleasure to take care of everything: procurement, costs, transportation and setup. Everyone’s been so kind to us here, it’s the least we can do.”

 

Oh, how Bennie grinned to hear that. He felt giddy, nearly childish, at the prospect of his haunted attraction’s climax. “Well, if it’s no trouble for you fellas…” 

 

“Not a problem at all,” said the Hallowfiend. 

 

A second round of handshakes ensued; an agreement was cemented. 

 

Over the next few nights, discreetly, the Hallowfiend and his helpers outlined the truth of their All Hallows’ Eve festivities. Sure, they’d construct a false ceiling, and provide scent dispensers, air blasters, strange skeletons, occult symbols, and disturbing melodies as promised, but the night’s true jubilation would lie in their “dummies.”

 

Having posed as a marine biologist some years previous, the Hallowfiend had acquired samples of *Takifugu rubripes* tetrodotoxin, which he’d saved for a special occasion. Forced to ingest a predetermined amount of that substance—dictated by their age, weight, and general health—a victim would become a living doll for up to twenty-four hours. First their face would numb over, and they’d feel as if they’d escaped gravity. They’d perspire, vomit and shit; they’d forget how to speak. As the tetrodotoxin’s bodily dominance grew, they’d become entirely paralyzed, their heartbeat and respiration abnormal, with a coma and cardiac arrest looming, which would sweep their soul from their body. 

 

Each of the Hallowfiend’s helpers, Oliver included, was assigned a task. Each was to kidnap an out-of-towner, someone who wouldn’t be recognized, and bring them to the Hallowfiend for their dose of tetrodotoxin. Once the second stage effects arrived, and they were entirely paralyzed, the victims would be transported to the Morse House to act as living props. Costumed kids and adults would parade past them, shuddering at their slack faces, as the “dummies” slipped closer and closer towards death. 

 

Of course, the Hallowfiend and his helpers couldn’t allow them to reach their comas. Indeed, once the Morse House was closed for the year, and they’d killed Bennie Philipse so as to have the place to themselves, they would gift each paralyzed sufferer with slow torture. Though their victims would be beyond any physical agony at that point, the psychological horror of witnessing one’s own organs unspooling, of pliers pushed between their lips to yank their teeth from their gums, of an eye yanked from its socket to better regard its twin oculus, why, that would certainly be worth savoring.

 

By the time that Halloween rolled around, all of their Morse House additions were accomplished, save for the “dummies”, which they assured Bennie would be arriving that evening. Each of the Hallowfiend’s helpers hit the road solo, to abduct a suitable person. 

 

Oliver found himself a short drive away, in the city of Burlington, early in the a.m., cruising the streets in his fuel-leaking Ford Pinto. Hoping to spy a lone woman or child with no witnesses around, with a bottle of chloroform and a rag ’neath his seat, he cruised past bars and schools, neighborhoods and shopping centers, to no avail. At last, when nearly two hours had elapsed, frustrated, he hollered at a pair of dog walkers, “Hey, where’s a good place to go hiking around here?”

 

“You can’t beat the Loop Trail at Red Rocks Park,” a grey-goateed gent answered, his rhythmic stride unbroken. Even when asked for directions, which he aptly provided, he and his female companion kept their paces unvarying, as a pair of Australian Terriers contentedly trotted afore them. 

 

A short time later, Oliver pulled into a parking lot. It yet being early morning, only three other vehicles met his sight, with no owners present. “This might just work,” he muttered, catching a whiff of his own coffee breath. He had options to weigh, which shaped his thoughts thusly: *Should I make my way down to the bay’s rocky shoreline, or wander the fringes of the loop trail, concealed by pines and hemlocks? Or should I save my legs the trouble and remain in my car until I sight a lone visitor? If I wait for too long, this park may become crowded. I suppose I’ll try the shore first. Perhaps luck is with me.*

 

And when he followed the gentle susurration of the bay’s tranquil blue water, upon which the reflected morning clouds seemed pallid, rippling islands, and spotted a middle-aged woman in a folding chair—reading a romance fiction paperback, oblivious to all else—it seemed that the pumpkin-faced deity was smiling upon Oliver. She had dressed for the weather: fleece jacket, sweatpants and Ugg boots. Auburn locks in need of a brushing spilled down her broad back. 

 

The woman cleared her throat and turned a page, as he crept up behind her. From Oliver’s back pocket came the chloroform rag, wafting sweet pungency. 

 

In that exalted moment, that sublime span of seconds, it seemed that an entire planet had been sculpted to encompass just the two of them, as if they’d become templates for all future life forms. His free hand seized her shoulder. His rag stifled her scream. She moaned and she thrashed—which seemed more of a slow dance to his fevered mind—for a while, attempting to stand and flee, until unconsciousness claimed her and she tumbled from her chair. Oliver tossed his rag into the bay and, with more exertion than he’d anticipated, hefted the gal up over his shoulder and lurched them back to the parking lot.  

 

“Damnation,” he muttered, spotting a pair of fresh arrivals. Emerging from a blue BMW, surging with mid-thirties vitality, were two square-jawed bodybuilder types: twins, with matching crew cuts and Nike gear. 

 

Slipping into a ruse, threading his words with faux friendliness, Oliver blurted, “Hey there, fellas. My wife had too many morning mimosas and is now dead to the world. We’re heading home for Tylenol and much bed rest, of course.”

 

“Wife, huh?” the leftward man said. “I know that chick. She owns that hole in the wall candle shop my girlfriend drags me into sometimes. Velma Mapplethorpe is her name…and she’s an obvious lesbian.”

 

“Why don’t you set the nice lady down?” the rightward twin asked, squinting into the sun, dragging a cellphone from his pocket. “We’ll call the police and let them sort this out.” When Oliver failed to respond, he added, “Nobody needs to get hurt here.”

 

Oliver weighed his options for a moment, and then dropped Velma to the pavement, so as to sprint to his car. Unfortunately, as he was fumbling his keys from his pocket, a flying kick met his thigh, sending him into his driver’s side door, cratering it. As he attempted to regain his footing, alternate fists met his face. Constellations swam across his vision, and then were swallowed by a black void. 

 

By the time that Oliver came to, a pair of officers had arrived to arrest him. The woman he’d nearly abducted had regained consciousness as well. Too woozy to stand, she trembled and vomited. *You’d have make such a great dummy*, Oliver thought, as handcuffs found his wrists and he was manhandled into the back of a police cruiser. 

 

A search of Oliver’s car uncovered his chloroform bottle. That, plus the testimony of Miss Mapplethorpe and her rescuers, resulted in Oliver being convicted of attempted abduction, a third-degree felony. With no prior convictions on his record—and no way for the prosecution to prove that his motives were sexual, which they weren’t—he was sentenced to three years at Northwest State Correctional Facility. 

 

Slowly did those years pass. For entertainment, he relied on the prison’s gymnasium, wherein he discovered a love of volleyball, and its library. He kept a pack of playing cards in his cell, for sporadic games of solitaire, and a head full of memories to warm him at night. 

 

Throughout those thirty-six months, not a single visitor arrived to commiserate with Oliver. Never did he learn of the Hallowfiend’s Morse House murders. His fellow inmates left him alone, mostly, though he was assaulted a few times in the outdoors recreation yard, resulting in nothing more severe than mild contusions and a few stitches. 

 

Post-release, he attempted to contact the Hallowfiend, but the killer and his helpers had, of course, absconded from Essex Junction. Strangers now occupied their last known residences. Their cellphone numbers were all out of service. There was no P.O. box that Oliver could write to. Most likely, the seven had moved on to another state entirely.

 

Indeed, Oliver’s time in prison had left him shunned by his ex-companions. The Hallowfiend couldn’t risk being associated with a known felon, after all; his deathly efforts were far too important. Even if Oliver attained a fake name, and identification to go along with it, his fingerprints and mug shot were in the system, and could be accessed by any cop at any time. 

 

Still, he chafed at abandonment. As an accomplice to many autumnal atrocities, he’d reveled in bloodletting, in the ear-splitting shrieks of supernal sufferers, in the slackening of faces as life ebbed away. He’d seen nightmares made corporeal, watched religious beliefs evaporate. He’d seen pumpkin fire gleaming in sheens of snot, sweat and tears.

 

Left to his own devices, murder hardly seemed worth the effort. Pitiable it was, like post-breakup masturbation. No great idea man he, to Oliver, plotting an original, aesthetic murder was nonviable. Either he’d settle for knifings, shootings, and strangulations like a dullard, or he’d be reduced to duplicating the Hallowfiend’s greatest hits. Would the Hallowfiend even abide a copycat killer? Would his pumpkin-faced deity? 

 

The only option, it seemed, was for Oliver to move on, to stop pining away for the Hallowfiend’s unique brand of predations and attempt to fashion a new life for himself. He needed a fresh setting, the antithesis of the spooky, secluded ambiance that the Hallowfiend cultivated. He needed year-round warmth and sunshine, palm trees and noisy neighbors. He needed chain stores and superchurches, so comfortably bland. He needed to socialize without ulterior motives. To that end, he bent his trajectory westward, toward Southern California. 

 

Unable to decide between the cities of San Diego and Los Angeles, he settled for Oceanside, a site of 42.2 square miles situated between them. 

 

Finding an apartment was easy; acquiring gainful employment wasn’t. After weeks of fruitless searching, he learned that the best an ex-con could do was land a position at Vanillagan’s Island, an ice cream parlor off of South Coast Highway. Working as an ice cream server/cashier alongside pimple-faced teenagers who mocked him when they believed him out of earshot, he donned his work uniform—white bucket hat, Hawaiian shirt, khaki shorts and sandals—day after day, and struggled to maintain a friendly face and vocal tone. Working full-time, he covered his rent and other expenses, but just barely. 

 

Neither ugly nor handsome enough to draw the ire of Oceanside’s average meathead, Oliver was the sort of fellow one’s gaze slid right over. Paunchy, not fat, balding with a bad combover, thin-lipped and weak-chinned, somewhat slight in stature, he could blend into any crowd with ease, but romance eluded him. 

 

Though he’d yet to make any new friends, he attained hollow satisfaction by making small talk with the ice cream parlor’s customers, and also with the grocery clerks and cashiers he encountered on his weekly shopping trips. Attempting to invite his next-door neighbors, a young Hispanic couple, over for a drink, he’d had to provide them with a rain check, which they seemed disinclined to use. 

 

Sometimes he drove to Barnes & Noble and read magazines from cover to cover, free of charge. Other times he strolled the Oceanside Strand, with sand and waves beside him. Meeting the eyes of scantily clad locals and tourists, seeking some indefinable quality therein, he found only indifference. When he could afford the expense, he attended the cinema solo, to experience the latest blockbusters. Days defined by dull routines flowed into weeks and months, leading to his current evening, nigh identical to those preceding it. 

 

He switched off the television and returned his unopened beer can to the fridge. The trash bag beneath his sink swallowed his Hungry-Man dinner remnants. 

 

Oliver hit the shower for a quick scrub down, and then brushed his teeth before a fogged mirror. Garbed in only a pair of flannel boxer shorts, he climbed into bed. Slowly arrived slumber. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Hours later, just before dawn, he blinked his way into consciousness. “Guh…what time is it?” he murmured. By the quality of the darkness, he knew that his cellphone alarm wouldn’t be jangling for a while, with its usual get-ready-for-work urgency. What had awoken him? He recollected no dreams. 

 

*“Nearly 5 a.m., man,”* answered a youthful voice, female, its tone quite sardonic. 

 

Having, naturally, expected no response, Oliver jolted. Swiveling his regard toward the intruder, he sighted a phenomenon most outré. It was as if the darkness wore a young woman, a high school aged female whose features were discernible, though translucent. Her knit wool beanie was white, her black sweatshirt dark and bulky. Beneath them, capri jeans tapered down to a pair of white-with-black-stripes Adidas sneakers. 

 

*A ghost!* Oliver realized. *Indeed, I’ve long wondered if they existed.* Studying her weary-yet-defiant features, half-convinced that his awakening had been false and he was lodged within a strange dream, he wondered aloud, “Did I…kill you? Did the Hallowfiend?”

 

Scrunching her face, turning a pair of palms ceilingward—the better to underline her disdain—she answered, *“Hallowfiend? What the hell is that…some kind of shitty John Carpenter rip-off? And you’re asking if you killed me? You? So, what, you’re some kinda murderer? Jesus fuck, sir, has everybody on Earth gone psychotic? What happened to love for your fellow man and all of that bullshit?”*

 

She was speaking too fast for him; it felt as if Oliver’s head was spinning. The poltergeist’s intentions, if she even possessed any, were a mystery. She seemed beyond caring if her appearance frightened him. 

 

Oliver’s mouth moved for some time before words emerged from it. “A ghost…you’re actually a ghost?” he said. 

 

*“No shit, genius. What tipped you off? The fact that I’m see-through, maybe? At any rate, any self-respecting lady would have to be dead to hang around this place, with your laid-off crossing guard-lookin’ ass. Have you ever heard of decorating? Shit, man, buy a poster or a painting, or something.”*

 

Ignoring her lambasting, Oliver put the back of his hand to his forehead to see if he had a fever. Though his flesh was quite clammy, its temperature was normal. “Why are you here?” he asked. 

 

*“Oh, like I had a choice in the matter,”* answered the specter, most bitterly. 

 

“Did you die here? Suicide, maybe? Slit your wrists in the bathtub? Chug a bottle of sleeping pills? Hang yourself from…somewhere? If so, no one said a word to me about it.”

 

*“Suicide? Don’t insult me, man. My death—not that it’s any of your business—happened in a loony bin. Get that look off your face. Yeah, I can see you in the dark; ghosts have great night vision. Anyhoo, I wasn’t a patient at Milford Asylum, my sister was. My parents and I were just visiting, being supportive or whatever. But when we got there, damn near everyone in that place was already dead. And their ghosts, man, tore us the fuck apart. Hey, what’s your name, anyway?”*

 

“Uh, Oliver. Oliver Milligan.”

 

*“Well, Mr. Milligan, you wanted to know why I’m here. Believe me, pal, I’d just as soon shuffle off to the afterlife. But there’s this entity, see, wearing some old bitch named Martha. She won’t let us—the other ghosts from the asylum and me, plus some others—leave this fucked-up planet. We’re nothing but pets to her, wearing invisible leashes. Wherever Martha goes, we’ve gotta follow, and the entity just keeps collecting more spirits.”*

 

With a sinking feeling in his stomach, Oliver said, “A ghost collector, huh. And what does the entity plan to do with her specters?”

 

*“Oh, more death and mayhem, I guess. Personally, I think she wants every single human on Earth dead.”*

 

Oliver’s fight or flight response revved its engines. “So, I guess you’re here to kill me,” he snarled, wondering how one might wound a ghost.

 

*“No, Mr. Milligan, not me…not if I don’t have to. My parents and I died sane, and aren’t trying to harm anyone. But we’re given so little time in which to manifest ourselves—to be seen, to be heard—I thought that it might be cool to hang out with you for a minute…you know, before the other ghosts kill you horribly and make you one of us.”*

 

“Other ghosts?” Oliver swept his head from side to side, sighting only ebon nullity. 

 

*“Yeah, man, I’m sorry. Your life, just like everyone else’s, has always been a joke, and you just went and set up its punchline.”*

 

He heard the click of a turned lock, the creaking of door hinges. Limned by the flickering corridor lighting, a figure stood, swaying on her feet, tangible though emaciated. Lengthy were her black locks; deeply sunken were her malicious peepers. Entirely absent of emotion was her slack face, from which speech arrived, though her lips were unmoving. 

 

*“A most excellent addition to my menagerie you shall be,”* said a parched, ragged whisper, which yet struck Oliver’s tympanic membrane with the force of a sonic boom. 

 

Oliver noticed his apartment’s temperature plummeting. Shivering, rubbing his arms beneath the covers, he managed to say, “So, are you this Martha I’ve heard so much about…or, more specifically, the entity wearing her? Your little friend over here”—he gesticulated toward where the spectral teenager had been, but she’d vanished the second his eyes left her—“told me all about you.”

 

*“I am what remains of the agonized once their spirits dissolve. I am vengeful wrath embodied, built on the recollections of sufferers. I am the dark reflection of humanity, here to end you all.”*

 

“Uh…I’ll take that as an affirmative.”

 

Still, the possessed woman made no effort to enter his apartment. *Does she have to be invited inside like a vampire?* Oliver wondered. *Will she flee before daylight? Her host seems so fragile, swaying there in the doorway, half-dead. Perhaps I can kill the poor bitch and end this nightmare.*

 

He owned no firearms, but kept a drawer full of cutlery, wherein sharp Ginsu knives awaited. Could he stab Martha in the heart before her possessor sent a ghost horde against him? Preparing to leap from his bed to attempt exactly that, he was startled by what felt like hundreds of fingers crawling along his legs and arms, as if they’d emerged from his mattress. Sliding through his little hairs, conjuring goosebumps, they segued to scratching. Thin rills of blood spilled from shallow scrapes; flesh ribbons curled away. Attempting to escape, Oliver found his wrist and ankles seized. 

 

Only then did his restrainers’ controlling entity enter the apartment. So soft of step that she seemed to be gliding, Martha pushed the door closed behind her, returning all to darkness. Oliver heard box springs creaking, felt a somewhat negligible weight settle beside him. Carrion breath scorched his nostrils, upon which rode the words, *“Every bit of suffering that you have meted out over your life span shades your aura, a topography of self-damnation. Before I add your specter to my flock, it amuses me to reciprocate those tortures.”*

 

Oliver found his lips pried apart, so vigorously that his mouth corners tore, parting each cheek halfway to the ear. One by one, slowly, lithe digits yanked his teeth from his gums and tossed them against the kitchen stove: *plink, plink, plink*. Iron fists crumpled his genitals, and then wrenched them away. Even as Oliver shrieked for their loss, his left eye was gouged out, then his right. Next, ghosts peeled away each and every one of his fingernails and toenails, which trailed little flesh streamers.

 

Humorlessly, Martha Drexel’s possessor giggled, as if to accentuate Oliver’s discomfort. The sound of it was cut off for him, abruptly, when lengthy fingers breached his ears and punctured his eardrums. Bleeding from what felt like hundreds of wounds, he might have wished for death, were that an escape.

 

In a hellish parody of lovemaking, Martha’s withered form then crawled atop him. Straddling him as he bucked and shuddered, she leaned down to lick perspiration from his forehead. Apparently satisfied that he’d been properly seasoned, she, with surprising strength, began to gnaw through his throat. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Life ebbed, as did his agony. Oliver’s mangled form became little more than old clothing to be sloughed away. Lighter than he’d ever felt before, he began drifting upward, out of the harsh, aching confines of corporeal existence, toward the beckoning afterlife that awaited him in the cosmos. Would forgiveness be found there, prior to dissolution?

 

His translucent skull breached the ceiling. A starfield filled his vision. Constellations he’d known since childhood seemed on the verge of metamorphoses. Amidst them, the moon, waning gibbous, might have been a mirror reflecting half-formed physiognomies. The sounds of early morning traffic—engines vrooming, brakes screeching, horns sporadically honking—and the hoarse coughing of nearby tweakers were subsumed by a celestial orchestration. 

 

Yet ascending, Oliver permitted himself to feel hopeful. No hell awaited subterraneously to scald him with undying flames. No Satan would flick a forked tongue to remind him of his misdeeds. 

 

Then, suddenly, frigid tendrils encircled his spectral waist to terminate his journey. *“Damnation,”* he whispered. *“I’m to be punished after all.”* 

 

Awash in the elated uncertainty of his demise, he’d forgotten his visitor’s tale of beyond-death enslavement. Losing sight of the cosmos, he unwillingly returned to his apartment’s weighted gloom. The dead teenager had been truthful. Ghosts did have excellent night vision. Lamps, furniture, appliances, even wall sockets—all were revealed to him. 

 

Awkwardly sprawled across his bed, almost as if disjointed, the possessed woman regarded him, vacantly. Tendrils of shadow undulated their way through her hospital gown, darker even than the surrounding darkness. Into Oliver’s spiritual orifices they surged, tugging his malleable ghost form inside out and compacting it.

1qfg46e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qfg46e,Finally sharing my home espresso setup,"After more than a year of lurking here, I figured it was finally time to share my setup.

I’ve been running my Rancilio Silvia Pro X paired with a DF64 II for over a year now, and I’m still absolutely loving this combo. It’s been rock-solid, consistent, and reliable enough that it hasn’t really triggered upgrade-itis (which feels like a small win on this sub).

The coffee corner is built using fully custom IKEA METOD cabinets that I installed myself, designed to follow the same style as the rest of the kitchen so it feels integrated rather than like a separate station. There’s still a small gap on the left that I need to close, but functionally it’s already exactly how I wanted it. I also ran electricity inside the cabinet, which keeps everything clean and cable-free, and even added a dedicated hole for the knock box.

The countertop layout is intentional, leaving a bit of free space on the right side so I can park prepared drinks while pulling shots. Small detail, but it makes the workflow much nicer.

For decor, there’s a handmade poster with some of the coffees I went through last year (let's see if anyone here recognizes any of them), plus three handmade cups made by my sister during a pottery course, which are easily my favorite pieces in the setup.

I work from home, so being able to step into the kitchen and make a proper espresso or milk drink during the workday is honestly one of the best parts of this whole setup. I’m also sharing a shot of the view from the coffee corner — looking out onto the terrace, the swimming pool, and all the surrounding green. Everything you see beyond that are orchards, which makes morning coffee and mid-day breaks even better.

My country recently passed a law criminalizing corporal punishment of children, which got me thinking. Yesterday I realized that my parents weren't just ""strict"", but probably straight up abusive. I still have my doubts about it though. Can you please help me make some sense of it?

\- my parents have broken things in anger and thrown my toys out the window

\- or I've been slapped so hard that I fell to the ground

\- also my father has run at me and knocked me under the table and beaten me on the ground because I ""looked at him funny"" (I was around 6 y.o.)

\- so I don't know if it really happened, but I think it did. When i was very little (merely a toddler) my mother pressed a pillow to my face and held it until I started to suffocate. I have only a vague memory of it and for a long time I didn't want to admit that it probably really happened. But two days ago I was washing my face in the shower and for a moment I couldn't breathe and this memory came to mind (like a flashback I guess?).

\- another memory: I'm 4 or 5 y. o., running away from my mother, screaming in terror and hiding under the coffee table, from where she would pull me out and beat me

\- and that's not all, the bullying was also psychological, like when my mother treated me like an adult from a young age, who had complete control over every action and has thought things through. She always saw me as mean and manipulative and I guess she still sees me that way, as self-centered liar who doesn't let things get to me. Like when I went to visit a friend and there was a misunderstanding about where exactly I was going (the places have similar names). The train on the way back was late, she got mad that I lied to her and left me at the station at midnight to get home alone. I was 15. Like wtf? She immediately assumed the worst and punished me by leaving me alone at night a few kilometers from home to get home on my own

To this day I feel like I have to be constantly helpful, always cleaning, helping, even when I'm on a visit at friend's house or at my fiancées family. When I was little, I learned to recognize footsteps in the hallway, whether they are heading my way or not, or to recognize the tone of voice, whether someone is going to yell at me, or if someone is angry. I actually didn't feel safe at home, or only exceptionally. To this day I don't like visiting my parents. A few years ago my mother verbally attacked me, I talked back and as a response she wanted to slap me (she actually did slap me, but I held her arm so she couldn't proceed further).

I denied for a long time that it could be that bad, maybe I even advocated for educational physical punishment of children (like lightly slapping, not straight up beating).

I think I was abused. Physically and emotionally. But when I look on the internet all articles say that physical abuse is accompanied by injuries or bruises, and I guess that didn't happen to me, so.. I don't know if I have the right to call what happened to me an abuse.

  
Thank you if you've read this far and thanks for any advice or even a commiseration. Sorry for the formal state and language of my post, I'm a bit upset about the whole topic

1qffzbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1qffzbn/how_to_break_the_ice_without_being_awkward_the/,How to Break the Ice Without Being Awkward: The Psychology That Actually Works,"I've spent way too much time studying social dynamics. Like genuinely obsessive amounts. Books, psychology research, analyzing interactions at coffee shops like some creep. And here's what nobody tells you about breaking the ice: most advice is complete garbage.



The whole ""just be confident"" thing? Useless. Confidence comes from having actual tools that work, not from repeating affirmations in the mirror. I used to think I was just bad at starting conversations, turns out I was just using terrible techniques everyone recommends. The problem isn't that you're awkward, it's that we've all been taught to approach social situations in ways that feel forced and unnatural. Society pushes this idea that charisma is something you're born with, but research in social psychology shows it's actually a learnable skill. Once I figured out what actually works based on behavioral science and real world testing, everything changed.



The Environment Observation Opener works because it's genuine. This comes straight from research on conversational dynamics. You literally just comment on something happening around both of you right now. Not some rehearsed line, not a question about the weather. Like if you're at a bookstore and someone's browsing the psychology section, you say ""I'm trying to figure out if reading about productivity actually makes me productive or just gives me another excuse to procrastinate."" It's specific, slightly self deprecating, and invites them into a shared moment. Vanessa Van Edwards talks about this extensively in Captivate, she's a behavioral investigator who's analyzed thousands of social interactions and breaks down exactly why certain openers succeed while others fail spectacularly. This book completely rewired how I think about first impressions, it's packed with research backed techniques that feel natural instead of manipulative. The whole premise is that charisma isn't magic, it's about triggering the right psychological responses. Insanely practical read that'll make you question everything you thought you knew about social skills.



The Curiosity Gap technique is stupidly effective. You lead with something intriguing that makes them want to know more. Instead of ""what do you do for work,"" try ""I'm curious, what's the most interesting project you've worked on recently?"" The difference seems small but it's massive. You're giving them permission to skip the boring script and talk about something they actually care about. This ties into research on intrinsic motivation, people light up when discussing things they're genuinely excited about. I learned this from reading Never Eat Alone by Keith Ferrazzi, this dude built his entire career on relationship building and the book is basically a masterclass in making authentic connections. The chapters on starting conversations with anyone are gold. He emphasizes that networking isn't about collecting contacts, it's about actual curiosity in other humans. Best networking book I've ever read, hands down.



For practicing these in low stakes environments, try using an app like Slowly. Yeah it sounds random but hear me out. It's basically pen pals but designed to encourage thoughtful conversation. You practice starting dialogues without the pressure of real time interaction, which builds the mental muscle for in person situations. Plus you end up connecting with people worldwide which is genuinely cool. The delayed messaging format forces you to think about conversation structure in ways instant messaging doesn't.



If building actual social confidence is something you're serious about, there's also BeFreed. It's an AI learning app that pulls from communication psychology books, expert interviews, and research on social dynamics to create personalized audio lessons. You can tell it specific goals like ""get better at breaking the ice in professional settings"" or ""stop feeling anxious in group conversations,"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan tailored to your exact situation. 



The depth control is clutch, you can do a quick 10 minute overview when you're busy, or switch to a 40 minute deep dive with actual examples and techniques when you want to go deeper. Plus you can pick different voice styles, some people like the calm analytical tone, others prefer something more energetic. It connects insights from books like the ones mentioned here with newer research, so you're not just getting one perspective. Worth checking out if you want structured progress instead of random YouTube rabbit holes.



The Playful Challenge approach works when you want higher energy. You make a lighthearted observation that's slightly provocative but clearly joking. At a party where someone's making an elaborate cocktail, you go ""That looks either amazing or like a terrible decision, I genuinely can't tell which."" It's teasing but warm, creates immediate banter potential. The key is reading the room, this doesn't work everywhere. But in social settings where people are primed for fun, it cuts through the typical small talk BS immediately.



Psychology research on humor shows that shared laughter creates bonding faster than almost anything else. It's why comedians can say wild shit to strangers and get away with it, the laugh creates instant rapport. This is covered brilliantly in The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane. She breaks down the neurochemistry of why certain behaviors make people magnetic and others make them forgettable. The book won multiple awards and Cabane coaches executives at places like Google and Stanford. Her section on warmth versus competence signaling changed how I approach every interaction. This is the best charisma book I've ever read, will make you realize most of what you've been told about likability is wrong.



Here's the thing about all these techniques: they only work if you're actually interested in the other person. People can smell fake curiosity from a mile away. The underlying principle isn't about manipulation, it's about creating opportunities for genuine connection by removing the awkward barriers we've built around social interaction. Most of us aren't bad at talking to people, we're just bad at starting because we've been given terrible templates.



The biological reality is that humans are wired for connection, we literally need it to survive. But modern society has created all these weird rules about how you're ""supposed"" to interact that make everything stilted. These techniques work because they bypass that artificial awkwardness and tap into how we naturally want to communicate. You're not changing who you are, you're just removing the obstacles.



Start small. Pick one approach and try it three times this week in genuinely low pressure situations. Coffee shop, grocery store, wherever. You'll be surprised how often people are relieved someone broke the ice in a way that doesn't feel forced. Most people are just as awkward as you are, they're usually grateful when someone makes it easy.

A quick post to give you a brief overview of my current game.

As mentioned, I'm playing as France in the modern world.

To begin with, I asked the secret service to contaminate the Netherlands with parasites (lice, lice, fleas, pubic lice, ringworm, etc.) in all their brothels. Then, I slightly contaminated all the cannabis seized in France with lead to make it heavier but not lethal, and offered it to the Dutch underworld, asking them to contaminate the coffeeshops. (For your information, cannabis production in the Netherlands is illegal, but its sale is permitted. Well, that's what the law says... okay, you can see how completely hypocritical that is...)

Next, I contacted the newspaper Mediapart and provided them with analyses from the French secret service on the quality of the drugs sold in the Netherlands. It caused quite a stir, and then I did two things:

1. I contacted the Netherlands to offer help in accommodating the Dutch population in our hospitals to treat both parasite problems and lead poisoning from cannabis. (And they loved me because they were in deep trouble...)
2. I told them I was considering taking over the VAT and transforming it into an Environmental Debt Tax (TDE). This tax essentially applies a 2.5% VAT rate to unprocessed or minimally processed agricultural products (flour, coffee, cocoa, etc.), with a 5% surcharge every 300km between the nearest border crossings of the exporting and importing countries, and a 5% tax reduction on all certified organic products. I was also thinking about their major issue of legalizing cannabis with state-controlled production, distribution, and sales, and that their current situation has made us consider certifying our cannabis as organic. We would be more than willing to supply them with French cannabis, but we would like their expertise to develop the specifications for making the cleanest product possible... and they loved the idea.
3. Against all odds, it was a hit with many countries, even African ones! So we exported a lot of it worldwide, which generated a huge amount of revenue that we invested in prevention and support for people with addictions, and we still had a lot of money left over from all of that... and now, what do we do with our money? Well, we contacted the 5 biggest national banks, we contacted all the French tech companies, we contacted Thales and we said to them, ""Hey guys! What if we built a gigadata center specializing in AI? AND GENTLEMEN BANKERS, if you give us a huge amount of extra money, I'll turn a blind eye if you manipulate the markets, provided it's never against French companies, and even if you do, we'll never investigate you... anyway... we managed to get nearly 200 billion euros to finance one datacenter... This datacenter allowed our secret services to carry out a lot of market manipulation, we managed to design new weapons, and we let them design the entire new AI complex from A to Z, which we positioned in Marseille (because there's a huge underwater fiber optic hub there)... Anyway, I'll stop there. Details, and at the end I'll tell you what I did. I asked Odin (our AI) to create a company specializing in improving the happiness of the French... we reached a happiness rate of 95% (and yet we're complainers in France!!!)... and from there, I gave a speech at the UN where I said that all the territories in the world that wanted to benefit from the quality of life in France could join France. All they had to do was hold a referendum... and then... Well, little by little the world is becoming French... a world of eco-conscious hipsters lol

And the worst part is, since it's the people who are asking me and my army is getting bigger and bigger, nobody says anything to me... they grumble a little, but that's all... There you go.",1,1768663062.0,PaxHistoria,0,1.0,False

I want to leave them with something physical, but as a student teacher, I’m basically living on coffee and hope, so I can’t exactly drop $200 on a class set of gifts.

I’ve been deep-diving into the best gifts for students from student teacher ideas for 2026, and the consensus seems to be that the kids value the personalized over the expensive. I wanted to find something that felt substantial but was sustainable for my bank account. I ended up going to Alibaba to source a bulk lot of high-grade Inspirational bookmarks and multi-color gel pens.

The plan is to use those supplies as the base of the gift. I’m spending my evenings this week writing a personalized note on the back of each bookmark, mentioning one specific thing that a student taught me this year. I’ve noticed that in 2026, kids are really responding to that co-learner energy, they love knowing they had an impact on their teacher’s journey, too.

I’m also setting up a Future Advice jar where they can leave me tips for my first year of real teaching. It makes the whole gift-giving process feel like a shared moment rather than just me handing out stuff. It’s a low-stress, high-impact way to say thank you and leave them with a little piece of the confidence we built together.

1qffl32,https://www.reddit.com/r/VIPHealthClub/comments/1qffl32/the_longevity_blueprint_what_science_really_says/,The Longevity Blueprint: What Science Really Says About Living Longer and Better,"We're living in a golden age of longevity research. Scientists have cracked open the biological mechanisms of aging, and the findings are both surprising and empowering. The good news? You have far more control over how you age than your genes might suggest. The even better news? Many of the most powerful longevity interventions are completely free.

## The 80/20 Rule of Aging

Here's something that might shock you: genetics account for only about 20-30% of how long you'll live. The remaining 70-80% comes down to lifestyle factors you can control starting today. This isn't just about adding years to your life—it's about adding life to your years.

Research from the famous Blue Zones (regions where people routinely live past 100) reveals that centenarians aren't just living longer—they're living better. They maintain independence, mental clarity, and physical vitality well into their 90s and beyond. The secret isn't exotic supplements or expensive treatments. It's a combination of simple, sustainable habits.

## The Five Pillars of Healthy Aging

### 1. Movement as Medicine

You don't need to run marathons or lift heavy weights (though both are great). What matters most is consistent, varied movement throughout your life. Studies show that people who maintain muscle mass and cardiovascular fitness into their 70s and 80s have dramatically lower rates of chronic disease and disability.

The sweet spot? Aim for 150 minutes of moderate activity weekly, plus two strength training sessions. But here's the kicker: even 15 minutes of daily walking can add years to your life. The key is to never stop moving.

### 2. Nutrition That Nourishes

Forget fad diets. The longest-lived populations share common eating patterns: mostly plants, moderate portions, and minimal processed foods. They eat until they're 80% full (a practice called ""hara hachi bu"" in Okinawa), which naturally creates a mild caloric restriction—one of the most robust longevity interventions in scientific literature.

Focus on nutrient density over calorie counting. Load up on colorful vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and fatty fish. These foods are packed with antioxidants, anti-inflammatory compounds, and essential nutrients that protect your cells from aging damage.

### 3. Social Connection: The Overlooked Longevity Factor

This might be the most underrated longevity intervention: strong social bonds. Research consistently shows that people with robust social networks live significantly longer than isolated individuals. Loneliness isn't just emotionally painful—it's as harmful to your health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.

Prioritize meaningful relationships. Join communities, maintain friendships, volunteer, or simply have regular coffee dates with people you care about. Your social life isn't a luxury—it's a biological necessity.

### 4. Purpose and Meaning

In Okinawa, they call it ""ikigai""—your reason for getting up in the morning. In Costa Rica's Nicoya Peninsula, it's ""plan de vida."" Having a sense of purpose is strongly associated with longevity and protection against cognitive decline.

Your purpose doesn't need to be grand. It could be gardening, mentoring, creating art, or caring for grandchildren. What matters is that it gives your life meaning and keeps you engaged with the world.

### 5. Stress Management and Sleep

Chronic stress accelerates aging at the cellular level, literally shortening your telomeres (the protective caps on your chromosomes). Meanwhile, quality sleep is when your body performs critical repair and maintenance work.

Develop a stress management practice that works for you—meditation, yoga, nature walks, or simply deep breathing. Protect your sleep by maintaining consistent sleep-wake times and creating a dark, cool sleeping environment.

## The Emerging Science: What's on the Horizon

Exciting research is exploring interventions like intermittent fasting, NAD+ boosters, senolytics (drugs that clear ""zombie cells""), and even partial cellular reprogramming. While promising, these are still being studied. The fundamentals—movement, nutrition, connection, purpose, and stress management—remain your most powerful tools.

## Start Where You Are

You don't need to overhaul your entire life overnight. Pick one area to focus on this month. Maybe it's adding a 10-minute walk after dinner, calling an old friend weekly, or establishing a consistent bedtime. Small, sustainable changes compound over time into remarkable results.

Remember: aging is inevitable, but how you age is largely up to you. Every day is an opportunity to invest in your future self.

And I stopped acting like I was dying every time my husband cheated.

Like tonight—when I found a pair of ripped stockings in the passenger seat.

Luca Valenti glanced at them like they were nothing, a smile in his voice.

“A girl likes to play rough,” he said. “Don’t take it personally.”

This time, I didn’t scream.

I just nodded—calm, understanding.

His smile vanished.

He slammed the brakes so hard my body jolted forward.

\*\*\*\*\*

“Don’t come over tonight. Luca’s back.”I texted the boy I was keeping on the side.

The reply came instantly: a crying emoji.

I almost laughed. I looked up—and met Luca’s dark, sharp stare, only then noticing how unnaturally quiet the car had become.

I put my phone away, my tone flat. “What?”

“You’ve changed.,” he said.

I froze for a beat.

This wasn’t the first time that girl had provoked me.

Last time, it was a pair of panties stuffed into Luca’s suit pocket.

The underwear still bore traces of bodily fluids, forcing me to confront the fact that he was cheating on me for the first time.

I’d trashed the room that night—screaming, sobbing, hysterical—like a woman losing her mind.

And Luca had stared at me with cold disgust and said only one thing:

“Can you be normal?”

“Don’t act like a madman.”

He always believed that a successful man like him couldn’t possibly have only one woman in his life.

My wife has always been me.

He even forbade his mistresses from having children; he only had casual affairs, and he would eventually return to his family.

So he didn’t think his infidelity was a big deal.

He just thought my reaction was too extreme.

I finally learned to listen to him and react calmly.

But he didn’t seem very happy.

I smiled. “Isn’t this what you asked for?”

Something in his expression tightened. His voice turned thin with mockery.

“Mia’s young,” he said casually. “And she’s got a lot of tricks in bed. Fun, you know?”

Then he looked at me, as if he were bestowing a favor upon me.

“Lena—learn from her. Stop being so boring.” He lifted a brow, smiling. “Maybe I’ll stay home a few more days.”

“No need.” I leaned back against the window and closed my eyes.

Luca hadn’t been home for a full month.

He’d taken Mia Morelli to the Maldives—called it a honeymoon.

He’d made it loud. Photos. Posts. One after another.

Enough to turn me into the biggest joke in our circle.

Now he stood in the doorway, staring at a home that no longer had a single trace of him.

The bedding was all different. The wedding photo that used to sit by the bed was gone. The room looked like he’d never lived here.

“Where’s my stuff?” he asked, frowning.

“I threw it away.” The boy I was raising came to our house during the month he was away with Mia.

On his first day, he didn’t like the wedding photos and whine that I should throw him out.

I was happy to spoil that obedient boy.

Luca, hearing this, suddenly turned to look at me. “What did you just say?”

Then he laughed—softening his tone like he was being generous again.

“Baby, I get it. I went too far. You’re mad?”

He stepped closer, voice warm and coaxing.

“Come on. I’m back, aren’t I? I came to keep you company.”

“I even bought you something.”

He dropped a gift bag onto the coffee table like a peace offering.

Then he turned and went to shower.

When he came out, towel around his neck, he spoke like he’d just noticed something offensive.

“Why is my body wash different?”

“There are no toiletries left, and the bath towels are disposable. You even threw these away?”

I blinked, confused for a second—then remembered.

Nico changed it.

Nico is the boy I raised.

He said he hated the original scent. He switched to orange blossom.

He still clings to me, kissing my body, trying to make me remember his scent.

And in bed, he coaxed me into throwing away many of Luca’s things.

A boy’s little tricks, nothing special.

Orange blossom drifted close. Luca came up behind me, arms wrapping around my waist, his breath deliberately grazing my neck—like he expected my body to remember him.

“Lena,” he murmured, pressing closer. “I missed you…”

“My body is desperately longing for you.”

My heart lurched.

I knew this was his way of showing his emotions, and his body temperature was also very high, but the mark Nico left on my chest had not yet faded.

If Luca went any lower, he’d see them.

I spun around and shoved him hard. “I’m not Mia.If you’re in heat, go find her..”

Luca stumbled back a step, then steadied himself—his face turning a sick, furious shade.

“You’re not done?” he ground out. “Are you finished yet?”

“It was just a honeymoon,” he snapped, as if I owed him understanding. “Didn’t I take you places before? What’s your problem?”

I looked at him, my voice so calm it startled even me.

“It matters,” I said. “Luca Valenti—I think you’re dirty.”

His expression was one of shock and anger. He stared at me for a long time, then suddenly let out a cold laugh.

“I hope you won’t be begging me to love you anymore.”

The veins on his hand stood out as he grabbed his coat off the sofa.

“Ungrateful.” His voice was a hiss through his teeth.

The door slammed so hard the walls shuddered.

I walked to the coffee table and stared at the gift bag.

I’m currently living in Pacific Beach, San Diego, and my job is asking me to relocate to Los Angeles. I’d be moving on my own with my dog, and I don’t have an established social circle in LA yet, so choosing the right neighborhood feels especially important.

What I like about PB (especially North PB / Bird Rock) is that it’s:
- It’s very walkable
- Lively, but with quieter residential pockets
- Relaxed trendy yet cozy
- Easy to meet people organically
- Big fitness / outdoor culture

I’m considering west side neighborhoods like Santa Monica, Hermosa Beach, and Playa Vista, but I’m very open to other suggestions. I currently pay $3.5k/mo in rent, and would like to stick as close to that as possible. 

What I’m looking for:
- Late 20s–mid 30s crowd (dating scene matters)
- Walkable area with bars, coffee shops, gyms, and restaurants
- Safe, pleasant streets for daily dog walks
- Laid-back but not sleepy
- Social without being overly scene-y
- Access to green space or nice walking routes go my dog and I 

Logistics:
- Office is in Culver City
- Open to a commute if the neighborhood fit is right
- Prioritizing lifestyle and community over the shortest commute

Questions:
- For someone moving to LA solo in their early–mid 30s, which neighborhoods tend to feel the easiest to build community in?
- Would Santa Monica be a better “starter” neighborhood socially than Hermosa Beach, or is that assumption wrong?
- Are there specific pockets of Santa Monica (or elsewhere) that avoid the tourist chaos but still feel lively?

Appreciate any honest perspectives, especially from people who’ve lived in multiple areas. Thanks!",4,1768662318.0,AskLosAngeles,28,0.64,False

I recently bought a DF54. Before that, I was using the built-in grinder of the Express Impress.

I’m really enjoying my new grinder. However, I’ve noticed that every now and then, there’s something strange floating in my coffee—like a little string or a bit of clumped-up gunk.

Do you guys know what this is? How can I prevent it, and why didn't this happen with the Express Impress grinder?

I use fresh beans, but that shouldn't be the issue, since as I mentioned, it didn't happen with the same beans when I used the Impress.

I walked to the coffee table and stared at the gift bag.

Only then did it hit me:

Today was supposed to be our fifth anniversary.

I opened the box.

Inside was the design I’d posted online a few days ago.

There’s only one in the world.

I bit my lip.

I hadn’t expected that even while he was cheating on me and going on his honeymoon with another woman, he wouldn’t forget to check my social media and carefully select such a luxurious gift for me.

How thoughtful.

Suddenly, my phone vibrated.

A message from Mia Morelli—an image.

She was disheveled. Luca’s head was resting against her chest, and through her half-dressed clothes, her fair skin was covered in intimate hickeys.

Followed by her text message:

“Auntie…even though I gave you a chance, you still couldn’t do it? You couldn’t keep Luca.”

“I pitied you. I knew today was your and Luca’s anniversary, so I came back early so Luca could come home and see you.”

“But how could you let him come to see me?”

“You’re so useless.”

I didn’t think much of it and just called Nico.

Nico was overjoyed to know Luca wasn’t home today.

He whine and begged me to come out and see him, but I refused.

Nico was unhappy, but he was very well-behaved and didn’t throw a tantrum.

The phone rang in the middle of the night—sharp, sudden.

I answered.

Luca’s voice came through, thick with the smell of alcohol. “Darling, come pick me up and take me home…”

I was about to hang up when another voice cut in—sober, impatient.

“Hello, ma’am. He’s drunk at our place. Can you come pick him up? We’re closing.”

I pulled out Mia Morelli’s phone number and gave it to them.

“Call her, that’s his darling,” I said. “I’m busy, I don’t have time to pick him up.”

This wasn’t the first time Luca had gotten drunk and needed someone to pick him up.

Once, I’d been burning with fever and still drove an hour through the night to pick Luca up.

He’d shoved me away—reeking of alcohol—still demanding Mia.

“I don’t want you,” he’d slurred. “I want Mia.”

He told me not to bother him.

I’d stumbled back. My hand hit the metal edge of a table. Blood ran down my fingers.

But it still didn’t hurt half as much as my chest did.

Now—wide awake again—I stared at the scar on the back of my hand.

Wounds heal.

Hearts… eventually stop bleeding, too.

A long time later, half-asleep again, the phone rang—same violence.

This time, it was a woman I didn’t know.

“Are you that drunk bastard’s wife?” she snapped. “He’s banging on my door in the middle of the night. Can you come get him? If you don’t, I’m calling the cops.”

“What?” I said, sitting up fully.

She gave me an address.

I went still.

Luca—drunk out of his mind—had wandered back to our old rental.

The tiny place from when we had nothing.

I had no choice but to rush over there.

I apologized over and over to the woman, then dragged Luca away from her doorstep.

He was all alcohol and unsteady weight, eyes unfocused, mind gone.

And then he spoke—soft, familiar—like the last few years had never happened.

“Lena…” he mumbled. “Was your internship exhausting today…?”

That name hit me like a punch.

In his drunken haze, Luca thought we were just out of school again.

Back when we were broke. Back when we curled up in that cramped apartment and whispered plans into the dark like they were promises.

I used to practice until late every night. No matter how late Luca worked—no matter how dangerous his own nights were—he’d still come to pick me up from rehearsal.

Sometimes he’d hold me so tight his arms shook, eyes red, voice raw.

“One day,” he’d swear, “I’ll give you the best life. I’ll make sure no one can ever look down on you again.”

My nose burned.

Tears fell before I could stop them.

I lowered my head, panicking—trying to wipe them away fast.

But someone was faster.

Luca lifted a hand and gently wiped my tears—so careful, like I was something fragile he couldn’t afford to break.

Then, like a wronged man, he complained with drunken confusion.

“Lena… why aren’t you angry anymore? Why did you change the body wash…?”

“How can you not be mad at Mia…?”

“You even threw away so many of my things…”

I looked down at him, and for once, I answered him honestly.",1,1768662243.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False
1qffg4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qffg4r/aitah_for_reaching_out_to_my_former_employer/,AITAH for reaching out to my former employer about getting rehired after they told me I was always welcome back?,"I worked for a well-known coffee company in NYC for about two years. I had a great relationship with the staff, regulars, management, and the owner. I genuinely loved the job, the coffee, and the community.

About a year ago, I left because my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer. I needed to be there to help take care of her. When I left, both the manager and the owner told me that I was always welcome back and that if I ever needed anything, all I had to do was reach out.

Thankfully, my mom’s cancer ended up being stage 1, and within a few months she was considered cancer-free. Once things stabilized, I found myself missing my old job. I’d never had any issues with the company, so I thought it would be reasonable to explore coming back.

Before reaching out to the owner, I checked in with the hiring manager and another manager I was still on good terms with. Both of them agreed that, given my history with the company and how I left, it made sense to reach out to the owner directly.

So I did. The owner told me they no longer handle hiring. I asked what I should do instead, and they eventually said I’d need to apply all over again through the normal process. I did exactly that.

A few weeks passed and I hadn’t heard anything. Since I’d been encouraged to reach out in the past and had been advised by managers to contact the owner, I sent a brief follow-up message asking if there were any updates. This is how the exchange went:

Me: No longer hiring???

Owner: Hey! I’m away so I think it’s best to check in via email via website. As I’ve mentioned I don’t do hiring anymore :)

Me: Sorry, I’ll stop bothering you 😅 best of wishes

Owner: Thanks boss and yes. I’m on vacation so let’s go the regular route, and I don’t respond to people messaging me asking for jobs :)

Me: I’m sorry. Truly, have a lovely vacation

Owner: Thanks boss!!

That last message really stuck with me. I wasn’t aggressively pushing, I wasn’t demanding a job, and I thought I was following both the guidance I was given when I left and the advice of current managers. In my experience, curiosity, initiative, and respectfully raising your hand have usually been seen as positives, not red flags.

So AITA for reaching out again to ask about getting rehired after being told I was always welcome back, especially after managers suggested I contact the owner? Or did I cross a boundary without realizing it?",0,1768662225.0,AITAH,7,0.5,False

I live in germany and connecting with people is maybe my favorite thing. I'm afraid I'm not your typical german. There are (a lot of) times I feel like I don't belong here. I don't know if it's because of the way I am or.. something else.

I find it hard to connect. I can talk to anyone, make friends and do things but truly connecting with someone is different. I want to understand how they function, what makes them smile, sad or angry. I want to understand how they view the world.

There are times I feel like I don't belong in this world because of the way I am. I have always had to adapt but deep down I'm a silly weird puppy. I yap a lot and when I get excited, I really get excited. I also like to be kind and want to help whenever I can. Standing up for people is very important to me because I didn't have that as a child, so of course I will want to do that.


Emotional intelligence is very important to me. It's something I'm constantly working on because I do not want to harm people with my pain.

I long to belong. It's hard for me to describe. I mean the things I say and I'm very loyal. I want to sit in silence and be okay with that. I want silence full of beauty and vulnerability. Vulnerability is so incredibly important to me, so is growth. I find growing to be painful but it is necessary and I need it.

I really need to grow. I'm not the type to stay comfortable all my life.

There are times in life in which I feel aimless, lost and then there are times I feel peaceful and know that tomorrow is a new day. I want to talk, share my experiences, share my pain and the things I want in life. I simply want to live to the fullest, with all the pain I have in me, all the laughter and the random thoughts. I want to share all of it. If more happens, I won't say no.

Seeing my partner shine and do better makes me happy.  I want to be vulnerable and experience everything so deeply and fully. I want it all. Some people want a lot of money or career. For me, it's connecting. It has always been that way and I don't mind it.
Maybe because it's so hard to connect. I want to get under someone's skin and I offer the same - with all the love and fear I have in me.

I'm very accepting and do not like to judge. Some get surprised how accepting I am. 
It takes courage to open up and I want to welcome it.

The boring things: I'm WEIRD. I like coffee quite a lot. I do a pour over every morning. I started crochet and painting abstract, cycling, knife painting, reading classics in coffee shops. I like doing different things. I'm kinky and like to experiment. I also have a high libido.
Sexually, I'm quite flexible when it comes to roles.
I have never been with someone who is masc, so I would love to experience that too.
Go through my hair, lightly scratch my neck and I'm all yours.

I also like to move my body and enjoy nature, traveling and so much more. I'm open to a lot of things. Trying new things can be quite humbling and I like that. I can be introverted and switch to extroversion real quick - it depends. Watching movies/tv series is also nice.

Psychology is very important to me and analyzing people is something I do automatically at this point.

I don't know what you want in life but if you feel like you want the same thing, let me know. I don't care if we have a lot in common when it comes to hobbies or not. More to talk about, more to get together just to simply share.

For now, here is a short story of one of the events referenced in the book. Maybe I’ll write others if anyone likes this. I’d love to hear what you think.

—

The air hung heavy over the tropical city. It was hot and oppressive and still. The kind of air that precedes an intense storm. It had in fact already stormed several hours ago. The rain water was dripping down from the trees and buildings splashing into puddles that gathered in uneven parts of the ancient cobblestone road.

In the square the city life went about its usual bustle and hum, as it had here for nearly four thousand years at this point. The city didn’t hold a candle to the great cities of the Centrimundi, but still, it was one of the older and bigger settlements around these parts. In a discreet corner of the square sat a nervous fifty-year-old Neurotechnologican, Dr. Ricardo Saucedo of the University of Northern Siesello - which was generally regarded to be one of the best universities for technology in the entire Richiessois Empire. Even the universities on the imperial home world of Richesse had long stopped competing with it. At least, he had been a member of the faculty before his abduction five years ago.

He sipped at his coffee on the terrace of a small coffeeshop looking out into the square, trying to keep the shaking of his arms to a minimum. The square was surrounded by colorful tropical buildings and large willow trees. In the center of the square was a long-neglected statue. No doubt some Canatacian king from a few hundred years ago, great in his time but now largely forgotten about. People walked about the square. Some groups of soldiers paced back and forth, on high alert no doubt since the bombing outside of the king’s palace on the pleasure planet Lagoroso. It seemed like the threat posed by La Gripa was growing every day. More bombings, more cyber attacks, more kidnappings - and more territory slipping from the hands of the House of Cantacia into the control of the fanatical extremist group.

The man across from Ricardo removed his optical implant and signaled for Ricardo to do the same. With a shaking hand he reached up and removed the device. He thought about refusing. Would they call it off? Or would they more likely cart him off and waterboard him for seventy days like they had before? Or would they lock his consciousness inside of the infernal digital prison again?

Ironic how that device had come back on him. He originally designed it, with protest at the time, for the imperial police, at the behest of the emperor. Now it had fallen into the hands of fanatics. To the outside world he had been sitting in a chair with sleek back earplugs in and dark black boxes on his eyes that connected to black bumps attached to his temples for four hours. To his consciousness he sat alone in a white room for 3,000 years. And then again, on another day for another 3,000. And again. And again. Until he agreed to do what they asked.

The giant man sitting across the table from him gave a slight signal with his hulking hand. Somewhere, Ricardo didn’t know where, a count down began. Fifteen seconds. He

Had heard the plan several times. Fifteen seconds until they would all see if his research and work had paid off.

With no warning, everyone standing or sitting around the square fell to the ground. There was a sound of a moan from some and then silence - almost perfect silence. Around the square, Ricardo and his handler, Ernesto, and some other men were standing. Ricardo reached over to the woman who had been sitting at the table next to them and put a finger on her neck. No pulse. The damned thing had worked. He knew it would. The theory had been sound enough and they tested it every step along the way. Still to instantly kill this many people at once. Ricardo fell to the ground vomiting. What had he just unleashed on the unsuspecting world?

Bolivar, a young student of his from the university once upon a time before being recruited to be the voice that would speak to Ricardo for La Gripa slinked over in her silky blue clothes from the other side of the square, stepping uncaringly over the bodies of the dead men, women, and children she had just tested La Gripa’s newest weapon on. In her hand, she carried a small smooth device which looked like a glossy white rock with an indentation in the middle - it was a relay device which would override the signals being sent to the optical implants by the server, forcing them to display an image, this damnable image that Ricardo had worked out for them.

Six years ago, he had continued on some neurological research into images which could have an adverse affect on the wiring of the brain. In the olden days they found that looking at images of certain patterns could cause your brain to rewire itself and its understanding of color, causing you to perceive red when actually you were seeing green and vice versa. They found that using inverted glasses for long enough would rewire your brain to see upside down, meaning that they didn’t see the world the right-way up when they took off the glasses. Ricardo expanded on that. Certain patterns of colors and shapes combined with the 3D display of the optical implant could cause physiological responses in humans. After an experiment went wrong and an image triggered a health crisis in a test subject, Ricardo broke off the research, citing its danger. But Bolivar was his research assistant.

When he was taken by La Gripa they had one mission for him - program an image which will cause instantaneous death. The number of Cantacian loyalists who died in the research… This one didn’t die fast enough. The image that killed subject 3678 didn’t kill subject 3679. And so on, for three years until they had their product. A single image which when viewed for a single second on the optical implant would cause instantaneous brain death. The body falls lifeless as the brain ceases to give signals telling the lungs to breathe, the heart to pump… Infallible and untraceable. And a relay device that could override the servers and project the image to any optical implant in the vicinity. For today, they had used a radius of 500 meters - enough to cover the square with a bit of wiggle room. With a more powerful relay, which the well organized and ruthless group could certainly organize these days, an entire city… Hell, maybe in time even an entire planet.

She smiled at him and he thought about where it all went wrong. She had become radicalized and all under his watch. He didn’t notice it. She was using his technology to kill people. But the concern didn’t last long. From a rooftop not so far away a particle beam pierced through his skull and shot out the front of his face and etched a line in the cobblestone before quickly shutting off. He was dead before he hit the floor. They didn’t need him anymore. They had their weapon for their fight against the imperial armies.",4,1768662010.0,scifi,6,0.83,False

Long story short: around 7 years ago I was into bartending, and because of that I learned quite a bit about coffee. Two years ago I stopped drinking, and now I’m getting into coffee as a new hobby. I’m very eager to learn, I’m studying different subjects, and I consider myself a meticulous person. I’m hoping to get solid advice and guidance from more experienced people here.

My main goal is to enjoy my daily coffee and build real knowledge about the extraction process and coffee in general—without falling into gimmicks or unnecessary hype.

I’d appreciate advice on the following:

1) Espresso machine

I’ve read a lot about popular brands, but I’m not sure what’s actually good long term. Price-wise, I’m considering a Breville Barista (the all-in-one format and screens are very tempting). Is that enough to grow with, or will I likely upgrade soon?

I currently have a De’Longhi Dedica Duo. I really dislike the frother, and I feel very limited in terms of control (water flow, consistency, etc.).

I’ve also seen some second-hand machines locally, like a Quick Mill 3240 for around $500, but I honestly don’t know if that’s a good idea.

2) Grinder

Do I need a separate grinder? If so, what are some good but affordable options that make sense for espresso?

3) Accessories

What are the essentials? (Scale, tamper, distribution tools, station, etc.)

4) Cups / glasses

Any recommendations for good espresso or milk-drink cups/glasses?

5) Coffee beans / suppliers

Any reliable brands or roasters you’d recommend to learn with?

6) Other brewing methods

Are there other extraction methods or gear worth exploring alongside espresso (press, pour-over, etc.)?

Additional details:

	•	I mostly drink milk-based drinks

	•	My total budget is around $1,000

	•	I usually make coffee in the morning, and I need something reasonably fast before work

1qff2ax,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qff2ax,I made another kinetic sand table - Dune Weaver Gold,"Okay, I have a confession: I'm addicted to making these. This one is called Dune Weaver Gold, a 45cm (17-inch) side coffee table.

If you have not come across my project before, Dune Weaver is an open-source kinetic sand table that is super 3D printing friendly. The software is completely offline and open source. You can integrate it with other technologies. We have WLED integration and Home Assistant integration. I have two versions available for free on Maker World, and three paid models available on my website.

These kinetic sand tables are mesmerizing to watch. They use two Nema 17 motors controlled by a DLC32 board. The backend is hosted on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W. The idea is very simple: You have two axes, one controlling the rotation and the other controlling the radial movement.  The magnet is mounted on the end of the radial arm, controlling a bearing ball or magnet ball on a sand surface. And with the magic of coding, you can create endlessly beautiful patterns.

What makes this project stand out from other open-source Kinetic Sand Table projects is that it is designed with 3D printing in mind.  That means you can print most, if not all, components. For components you cannot print, they are also readily available off the shelf, rather than requiring a CNC machine or a wood workshop to make.  The Dune Weaver Gold is designed around the IKEA TORSJÖ coffee table. I will also admit that I'm much more comfortable developing software than hardware, so I may have put too much effort into this on the software side.

Designing the Dune Weaver Gold was super fun. I quickly got to a prototype in about a weeks' time and fully assembled one together. Then I ran into all sorts of problems.

* My messy wiring job actually fried the UART pins of a Pi Zero 2W. During my bench test, everything worked, but when I put everything together, it didn't, and I couldn't, for the life of me, figure out what was going on.
* I fixed that and put everything together, and the LEDs were not working due to a loose connection. Hot Glue gun to the rescue
* It was also super hard to take off the motor assembly. Back to the drawing board.

But like with any other project, the first prototype is rarely ever the final version. After a couple of iterations, Dune Weaver Gold is ready, and now you can make one too. The cost for this project was about US$200 for me, with the biggest spend on the IKEA table.

Here are some new ideas in this version compared to my previous ones:

* Uses a mirror as the sand bed. The mirror is also from IKEA and is super thin, so we don't need a magnet ball anymore. A ball bearing would do, and the ball rolls!
* Fully enclosed design with heat vents at the bottom. Modular so that you can easily access the electronics and movement system for maintenance.
* Unique mounting system that attaches on top of the table legs.
* Break down complex parts so you don't have to reprint everything for adjustments/improvements.

1qfezhh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qfezhh,Week 3: Contrasts - Elevated espresso milkshake,"Contrasts: frozen milkshake base vs hot coffee, creamy milkshake vs clean coffee flavour and texture, colour contrast. 

For this prompt I initially intended to make a very dark, intense (but not bitter) chocolate ice cream with a fiery chilli sauce... and then I tried one of those McDonalds limited edition espresso milkshakes. It was surprisingly good (I do like their coffee!) but I knew I could make something way better myself. 

  
For the ice cream I used an adapted version of the fior di latte recipe in Gelupo Gelato with a little added vanilla. As written, the recipe yields a slightly caramelly flavour from heating the milk to thicken the cornflour (cornstarch). I avoid this by thickening it in a small amount of water and increasing the powdered milk to compensate for the extra water, then mixing the whole lot at the end with a handheld blender. I also adjusted the sugar to my milkshake preference and added a little more cream (my tub was 300ml instead of 250ml). The milk was semi-skimmed anyway, since I made this late at night on a whim with zero planning 😅

I set the ice cream maker to a softer gelato setting. Once finished, I plopped the gelato straight into the glasses, skipping the usual freezer step. 

  
The coffee is Hawaiian Kona made as standard espressos from the machine. 

This was incredibly delicious. We're considering making more tonight, despite it being a zillion calories (of happiness) and very filling. I think I'd choose a coffee with just a touch more acidity next time. ",12,1768661104.0,52weeksofcooking,1,1.0,False

1qfethl,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1qfethl/the_truth_about_being_a_cumdump/,The truth about being a cumdump,"I've been a cumdump for a while now (nearly 8 years) and I love the way other guys treat me. I'm devalued as a person. I'm made to face the reality that my sole purpose in life is to allow men to use my body and my holes for their sexual pleasure. I'm basically not a full value human. Im viewed and treated as a cheap, pathetic, slut who's whole existence is to be available to any man, at any time, so they can use me however they want, and I don't get a say in it. And men have done some pretty terrible things to me. I've been pissed in, and on, while other guys are fucking me, I've had guys put me on the spit and cum in both my holes at the same time, I've been choked so hard that I passed out for a minute while guys continued to use me, I've been fed cum that has dribbled out of my ass as the next guy starts fucking me, I've been made to go home without my undies or shirt cause they'd been ripped off me, after 14 guys had all finished using me, so cum was leaking out of me and running down my legs, which is impossible to hide when Im at the bus stop. But I think the most degrading thing that's ever happened to me is while I was in a motel room being used by the 10 or 11 guys who were there, one of them found my phone (which never used to have a screen lock on it) and found my girlfriend's number in the call list (hers was the one with all the love emojis after her name) and called her while one guy was fucking me and another two guys were talking turns with my throat and made me talk to her. She was obviously aware that something was happening cause I was barely able to speak proper words and I eventually hung up. But as the guy who was fucking me got close, I begged him to cum inside me and fill me up like the slut I am. What I didn't realise was, the guy who called my gf in the first place had called her back a second time and she heard everything I said! I panicked for a second before realising that i can't make her ""unhear"" what I'd just said, and that this relationship was over immediately, so I just resigned myself to the situation and let her hear everything. My phone was put on the bed in front of me, and the guy who called her went back to fucking my throat, just as the guy fucking me yelled out ""here it comes! Take it you whore!"" And let out a loud grunt and emptied his balls inside me. I just moaned with pleasure as he filled me while I enjoyed the dick I was sucking on. I don't know how long after that she hung up cause I stopped paying attention to the phone and went back to performing my duty as a piece of meat.

I was used for another hour before everyone was done and as people started to leave, one of them said ""better check your phone, slut."" I'd been so used I was exhausted. I couldn't stand up for nearly half an hour cause my legs were so weak. But when I finally got enough strength to get up and start getting dressed I looked at my phone and they'd sent her photos and a video of me getting used by these guys and me obviously enjoying it. I tried calling her but she'd already blocked my number so I just went home and I never heard from her again. 

After this, I decided that trying to have a relationship with a woman while keeping my sex life with men a secret was impossible and I stopped dating. 

I'm still used on a regular basis by lots of guys all over my area now, and a few of them have become ""regulars"". And while no one actually says anything obvious in public, I do get looks from random men at the shops, or when I'm getting coffee or having lunch, and it's obvious they recognise me, and it makes me feel kinda sexy knowing that lots of people in the area immediately recognise me as the local slut who's a freeuse cumdump for any man wanting. 

I like it, I enjoy it, and I will never regret it. 

I HAVE been advised recently though, to get on prep. I thought about it but have decided against it. I get tested 4-5 times a year, so that's enough for me. If I end up catching something, it's just part of life. I'll just have to deal with it. At the end of the day it'll be my fault. But it's a risk I'm willing to take, because I love being a freeuse cumdump. More than anything else in the world. ",0,1768660686.0,askgaybros,15,0.48,False
1qfet8t,https://i.redd.it/duzubfu78xdg1.jpeg,How I Accidentally Fell Into Fragrances And What I Actually Think About My Collection,"Before perfumes there was a mist.

Bath and Body Works Mad About You.

This is where everything started for me and it still feels unreal that it is not even a perfume and yet nothing has topped it emotionally. I remember a night duty in OBGYN when I sprayed it generously in the duty room just for myself. I had no idea back then that smelling good could change how people perceive you. Later I noticed my female senior resident casually taking repeated sniffs like she was trying to locate the source. When I realised she was sniffing the air because of me I turned red. That moment changed something. It made me aware of scent as presence.

They discontinued it and that still hurts. I tried many other BBW mists later but nothing came close. That one mist pulled me into candles perfumes and this entire obsession and even today I have not found a fragrance that recreates that exact feeling.

Now coming to my actual collection. No hype talk. Just lived experience.

Bottega Veneta Parco Palladiano I

This is my best pick and honestly one of the most beautiful scents I have ever smelled. It feels like standing inside a dense forest right after rain. Everything is green damp fresh and alive with flowers in the background. It gives a calm intimate feeling like sitting quietly with people you love. This was my best blind buy and the only fragrance I bought two bottles of immediately. The only heartbreak is longevity. If this lasted longer I would happily wear nothing else for the rest of my life.

Rasasi Hawas

I have tried Ice,tropical and black but original is still the cleanest and most wearable. It just works. Easy everyday fragrance that does not offend anyone and performs reliably in Indian conditions.

Azzaro The Most Wanted Intense EDP

This is my go to date night fragrance. It is warm sweet and confident without being childish. Easily the most complimented fragrance in my collection and it has never failed me socially.

Bvlgari Le Gemme Kobraa

This one is special. The brand talks about charm and mystery and that description actually fits. When you walk into a room wearing this your aura feels heavier in a good way. Very masculine but not aggressive. No harsh spices just smooth power. I genuinely do not understand how they made something so commanding yet refined.

Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male Elixir

Possibly the sexiest bottle design out there. The fragrance itself is extremely sweet. Almost candy like. Feels like diabetes in a bottle. If you enjoy sweet scents you might love it. Women definitely do. For me it leans feminine so I use it very selectively.

YSL Y EDP

Too hyped in my opinion. Smells okay but nothing memorable. I did not enjoy it enough to justify keeping it so the bottle is no longer with me.

Dior Sauvage EDP

This just feels basic now. Overhyped and overused. Smells like an expensive bathing soap. Enourmous projection,once sillage drops quickly and it becomes too close to skin. Not worth the price for me.

YSL Y Le Parfum

Another body wash in a bottle. My sister said this the first day I wore it. She has hyperosmia and her exact reaction was you smell like body wash. That was enough for me. Never touched it again.

Khadlaj Island Dreams Extrait

Absolute monster performer. Blind buy that shocked me. Massive projection strong sillage and it lasts days on clothes. Easily one of the best summer fragrances I own and completely worth the money.

Uomo Salvatore Ferragamo

This is a winter workhorse. Masculine well structured and comforting. If someone wanted a single winter fragrance and nothing else this could easily cover all bases. The base is the highlight with light leather cardamom and coffee blending beautifully.

Armaf Shades of Wood EDP

This is the best budget fragrance I own and probably Armaf’s finest creation. It smells like an old wooden almirah filled with dried roses. Loud saffron dark leather heavy spices and a dry non jammy rose. No sweetness no fruitiness just depth. I say this as someone who usually avoids clones. This does not feel like one. It is the only Armaf I own a backup bottle of.

Marc Jacobs Decadence

Honestly did not like it. Bought it only because it was available very cheap. That is the truth.

Montblanc Explorer Platinum

Very classy fragrance. Balanced sweetness with a creamy coconut vibe. Violet dominates with soft woods underneath. Feels refined and gentlemanly. A cousin hugged me and immediately asked if I was wearing Santal. Works well for formal settings and dressy occasions. Solid performance with controlled sillage.

Albait Aventus

Like most Aventus clones the opening is very synthetic and sharp. That said the drydown is genuinely beautiful. Smooth smoky and addictive. If only the opening was toned down this would be excellent.

Theoreme Matrix

Not Aventus Absolu. I have finished three bottles of this. It feels like a blend of Aventus and Hacivat leaning fruitier. Low resolution inspired scent but very enjoyable. Non linear with a good drydown and decent performance. If you like the DNA you will enjoy this.

Théorème Homme Rue Broca

Not really a peak summer fragrance for most Indian climates. More suitable for office environments and northern weather. It is a Tygar DNA with a sharp citrus opening that dries down into musky powdery grapefruit with light spice. Very unique signature scent profile.

Hugo Boss Orange EDT

Easygoing and versatile. Works anywhere and especially office friendly. To my nose it smells like fizzy cola mixed with fresh citrus. It is one of those fragrances nobody really hates. Lasts around six hours on me which is more than enough for this kind of scent.

What I love most is how uplifting it feels. It takes me back to simpler times. Sunny Sundays. Laughing with close friends. Hanging out at familiar places without checking the time. It is not trying to impress. It just makes you feel good.

Other mentions

Arabian Aroma clones perform insanely well and easily last 24 hours. The opening is horrible with heavy alcohol blast and smells like toilet cleaner initially but the drydown is surprisingly good.

That is my honest experience so far.

I am open to more blind buys so feel free to suggest anything interesting.

I’m not here to judge just sharing a few things that might actually help.

If you have a lot of syllabus left, follow the Pareto principle:  
  
👉 *80% of questions usually come from 20% of topics.*  
  
Use AI smartly upload old question papers and the syllabus, figure out which topics repeat the most, and focus there first.

Make short notes. Not fancy notes just small like a bit :), clear points that are easy to revise.  
On the day of the exam, revise only these short notes. Don’t open anything new.

Please don’t stay up all night. Your brain isn’t a machine.  
If you’ve already messed up your sleep and have no time left:

* Take a paracetamol if your head hurts
* Have black coffee
* Lie down for 20–30 minutes When the caffeine kicks in, it’ll help you wake up better.

Take a cold or warm shower whatever helps you feel fresh.just pack ur hall ticket , tools and pen day before.  
  
Once you reach the exam hall on time , just breathe, relax, and clear your mind. A calm brain works better than a stressed one.

And finally 10th and 12th are just milestones, not the finish line.  
Scoring full A+ or just passing doesn’t decide your life. Yes, people may treat you differently for a whilebut long term, it’s about how you live, learn, and adapt.

**For context:**  
I scored 68% in 10th and 56% in 12th.  
Today, I earn more than most of my peers and I’m doing just fine.

Marks don’t define your intelligence.  
They don’t decide your future.  
This exam matters but you matter more.

My favorite part was sitting at the bar each night and getting to know the bartenders, servers and fellow patrons. This cruise is such a perfect way to solo travel. I am also not a drinker and prefer early nights. You can absolutely make this trip whatever you’d like it to be. 

Attire: I loved dressing up each night. I did not feel out of place or “too fancy” wearing heels. With that said, I also had no problem going into the dining halls with a bikini and sandals (lol). The vibe is right - judgement free zone. 

I got the balcony sea terrace room. It was lovely. The room was perfect, peaceful and tastefully decorated. Great movies. I enjoyed Breakfast at Tiffany’s each morning as I sipped my coffee.

My financial contribution, including rent, pays for more than half of the housing and utilities. This also includes about 3 dinners a week, but I’m on my own for meals, otherwise. I do have something of a large space because I’m in the addition that was built to be kind of a sun room, and there’s an extra space/room because it’s really the walk through from the main house to the sliding glass doors. I don’t have an actual door to my personal bedroom/ personal area, and had to fight to keep people from tracking through it. There’s a door that opens to the garage opposite my bedroom “door” and a door going to the backyard, so it’s not much of a problem anymore. 

Basically, I’m covering over half the cost of living in an otherwise 3 bedroom, two bath house with 4 other people. This is relevant because there is some weird attitude towards me for having more “space “ than anyone else in the house. I have one, two shelf cabinet in the kitchen (huge kitchen with tons of cupboard space,) and use the refrigerator in the garage for everything but my one coffee creamer, because it’s a huge pain to refill my coffee and walk down steps if I kept it in the garage. I’m disabled. 

I’ve been having issues with the rest of the household over the use of the garage refrigerator, a side by side. Most of the problem is my son’s girlfriend, who doesn’t live here, but spends about 3 nights a week here. She has a habit of bringing all kinds of food over, some that she gets from food pantries, just stuff she eats, and never throws anything out or cleans out the bad food. Half of the kitchen refrigerator is filled with her bad food, and she also uses the garage fridge when it’s full. 

I’ve talked to my son about this and he even suggested I move out the old reusable containers that sit there for weeks on end. And because the bad stuff takes up so much space, about 2 of the 5 shelves, she’s been moving my stuff, on my top two designated shelves, to make room for her crap. It’s not unusual to open the fridge door on Saturday morning, only to find two full grocery bags of her stuff crammed on top of mine. This has caused me to lose food because it either gets shoved behind something and I can’t see it, or the covers come off my leftovers and they go bad. I put my groceries away in a very specific manner according to my ability to see them, reach them and be able to use them before they expire. 

Once more, I opened the refrigerator door and my stuff was rearranged to make room for things she put in last night while there’s stuff on the other shelves that shouldn’t be in there. I’m going to try and have another conversation with my son this morning, but I don’t know what new I could say. I already had a conversation with my grandson this week when he admitted to being the one to stick a frozen turkey on one of my two shelves, crushing my frozen dinner boxes. I had him help rearrange the shelves to make room and explained that it’s not ok to just shove things on top of my things, because he doesn’t want to take the time to move anything around.

While I have purged all the “real” addictions, I keep two: caffeine and nicotine. My caffeine routine I have on lock; I start my day with three espressos, and have an afternoon coffee. If I’m feeling randy, partylicious, and feral, I’ll have a final “night boost” espresso at 5PM, sometimes even as late as 6PM.

But I’m evading the issue. 

My nicotine policy is wild. I buy those stupid mouth 3mg pouches only for “special” occasions. Though, the definition has recently shifted to fit my little desires. Prior, it was weddings, or New Years. Recently though, I found myself getting pouched because I “wanted to focus on my screenplay.” (I’m sorry. I live in Los Angeles). 

Where I may be TA (asshole and addict) is that going kangaroo mode is a nice upper, but nothing really hits like a good ol’ fashioned vape. Thing is, I refuse to buy my own. Absolutely not.

If I did, I'd hit it all day and I won’t get the flying high feeling. I LOVE this feeling. It’s like 10 seconds where Obama is still President and masks still means costumes, a moment where $1 still buys a FAT cheesy bean and rice burrito.

Anyways. Vaping is a disgusting habit, and I judge potential romantic partners who vape as “immature,” so I tell myself, I would be immature to purchase a vape. They also cause popcorn lung or something (I haven’t done the research bc I wanna keep bumming vape). 

But “borrowing” someone’s vape is different. I have two vape friends and i just ask to hit theirs. Every gathering (probably 2x a week), I will be on them, “Hey can I hit the vape?” And one is gay so we make a joke of it and I say, “Daddy can I get my juice?” I would say I do this between twice and eight times a night. 

THOUGH, sometimes, I will buy them a drink to make up for it. And for Xmas this year, I bought my primary vape daddy two 20k puff vapes and the other, I bought one. I don’t think I consume 20k vape puffs a year but haven’t measured.

I feel like this is reasonable, but when I used to smoke cigarettes, people would always say those that bummed or even buy cigarettes (as in $1 per) are “the absolute worst.” And I do feel a pang of shame when I have to ask for the umpteenth time, “Can baby get his milk?”

So, AITA?

Film studios claim movies take years because of writing, scheduling and post-production. In reality, they’re just hyping it to make it seem like a huge artistic effort.

What actually happens:

Movies are filmed like theatre plays. One big warehouse. Multiple cameras and done.  
Sometimes the actors don’t even have to be there. They just film their scenes on their phone wherever they are and send the recording in.  
Actors don’t memorize lines anymore. They read them off screens or have tiny earpieces.  
Green screens everywhere. Even the coffee cups are CGI now.  
All effects are added later by AI. Explosions, cities, lighting, weather, vibes etc and AI handles it overnight.

1qfef7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1qfef7s/wlw_transference_in_therapy/,WLW Transference in Therapy,"Hi guys, this is a situation that happened to me a while back, but I’m still finding myself ruminating over it. I would really appreciate your input.

I started therapy for the first time in January 2025. I quickly realised I was attracted to my therapist. I hoped she’d be cold and distant so I wouldn’t develop feelings but she was warm and very welcoming.

In just our second session, I disclosed my experience with SA, and she shared her own story in response. It felt like a pivotal moment in building emotional trust and connection between us. During that same session, she told me that she doesn’t just forget about clients when the session ends and that she thinks about me a lot.

In the third session, she told me I was beautiful and asked, “Have you ever had a boyfriend or girlfriend?” When I said no, she replied, “Well, they must all be blind.” That moment intensified my emotions and attachment. She continued to compliment my appearance in later sessions and said “I imagine you get a lot of attention because you’re very attractive.” At another point, when I told her I felt like a burden, she said, “You’re my priority.”

I eventually came out to her as a lesbian. She was the first person I ever told, and she said she was ""honoured"" and even admitted she sometimes questions her own sexuality from time to time.

She encouraged me to text her anytime if I felt low, and said we could even meet outside of sessions. Our hugs at the end of each session lasted 10–20 seconds… always tight and meaningful. 

One night, when things turned violent in my home, I texted her at 1AM in distress. I didn’t expect a reply, but she responded with: “I’m here for you not just as a therapist, but because I care x.” She offered to send a taxi to bring me to her house to stay the night. I declined, but she then suggested we meet for coffee another time.

My feelings for her grew, and eventually I wrote her a letter and made her a CD with some of my favorite songs. My mom found it before I had the chance to give it to her. She immediately messaged my therapist to tell her I had “unnatural feelings” and demanded she cut off contact with me all before I got the chance to speak for myself.

I sent her a follow-up text to say the following:

""I’m really sorry. I feel so disheartened that this is how things unfolded. My mum found the gifts I made and was planning to give to you and immediately knew their meaning and context.

I never meant for this to happen and I’m so ashamed, but I completely understand if you think a break is necessary for the therapeutic process or even termination if you feel that is what’s best. I just wanted to acknowledge it myself rather than hearing it second hand.

I sincerely apologise if you’ve taken any offence at all or have made you feel uncomfortable. I know it’s very stupid and illogical. I understand the importance of your role, the ethical duties and would never want to jeopardise your career or life. I completely understand it would never be reciprocated and I never expected it to be. I just wanted to say thank you again for everything. I can’t thank you enough. My appreciation and respect is beyond measure.""

And she replied with this:

""Therapists cannot accept gifts. You have not at all made me feel uncomfortable or offended. As my client and as your over the age of 16 confidentiality is paramount and termination etc is your decision. Take some time to work on what we discussed yesterday. I wish you all the best in the future.""

She texted my mum to say she regretted to inform that she would be stopping contact. I was absolutely heartbroken at the time. Then 2 weeks passed by and she showed up at my workplace after termination (she knew where I worked). She called my name, asked how I was, told me she sought out help from supervision and said I could come back to therapy any time I wanted. I asked if I could give her a hug and she didn’t answer, she just embraced me in her arms. When I was watching her walk down the stairs to leave she never turned back.

I didn’t contact her again until 3 months later when I got a bipolar diagnosis and she responded by saying “I ask that you refrain from contacting me, respecting your mom’s wishes”.

Overall, the situation has me really confused. The mixed signals are crazy. What do you guys think? Did she simply get scared once a third party found out and stepped in, and then tried to reinforce boundaries way too late? Am I imagining her breaking boundaries?

I would really appreciate any advice, thank you! :)",3,1768659673.0,LesbianActually,2,1.0,False
