I'm looking for anyone who might want to have some light or casual conversations, or want someone to check in on them from time to time. With the nature of how online friendships tend to go (you know what I mean) and the holidays looming on the horizon, I want to preface this by saying I'm just here for friendly exchanges; no commitment, no pressure and most importantly, no judgment.  
  
I'm always curious to hear other people's stories or about their interests. Whether it's sharing things about hobbies, daily life, music, shows, memes, pets, that one barista at the coffee shop that always gets your name wrong, literally anything is on the table (well, I lied, maybe not *everything*; I'd rather not discuss politics or religion). I work a regular 9 to 5 on weekdays. I'll usually be online in the evening but I tend to pop up here and there during breaks and whatnot. I'm not that interesting myself, but to get the conversation started, I enjoy listening to true crime or horror podcasts. I like putting on shows like Kitchen Nightmares, Hell's Kitchen, The Office, Simpsons, or whatever is easy watching in the background while I do other stuff. The ""Discover Weekly"" on Spotify has been giving me duds for the past 3 weeks. I like to game on PC, but have so many games that I get overwhelmed deciding what to play that I end up not playing anything at all (though I'm working on it); I'm mostly a variety gamer so I play stuff that's outside of the regular League or Fortnite (though I have dabbled in them, very very little). I have a dog, he's an 11 (soon to be 12) year old Shih Tzu. Oh, and I recently became a homeowner! It's a small place, but it's mine!  
  
If you've read through all that and are interested, send me a message on here and tell me these 3 things: a little bit about yourself, the song or show you've been really into recently, and if you had 24 hours to have any superpower, what would it be and why.

Last week my sister and her husband (who both grew up in the church but are now both agnostic) introduced me to a friend of theirs who they thought would be a match for me (Lets call her Sarah). A few days later Sarah and I met for coffee and we hit if off, we are are meeting again later this week.

But, I have reservations:

1. She's 32 (4 years older than me). I want kids in the future and I feel that would be easier with someone closer to my age or younger.
2. I have no relationship experience as an adult. Sarah has in some relationships.
3. Sarah is not religious so I'm afraid to share my religious beliefs with her, especially about how I'm  a virgin and I have been saving myself till marriage.

What makes this hard is that Sarah is a wonderful person, and like I said we really hit it off but I just don't know its this is worth exploring. Should I pursue this relationship despite our differences or should I pursue someone in the church?",1,1733724573.0,Catholicism,0,1.0,False

* Simple Truth (not terrible but very light in flavor)

But unlike the others, MH manages to have flavor without being bitter.

In addition, during winter months my hands get so Cold and dry that I get fingertip cracking or fissures; usually on my thumb. If I sit criss cross my ankles and feet start getting the pins and needle sensation within a few minutes. I’m pretty sure it’s the stimulants. Has anyone experienced this?  Has anyone switched to a different med because of similar side effects? Adderall, helps my productivity and mood tremendously, I’m, irritable, depressed and lethargic off it.

Are there different types of blood patches, which require different recovery time/rules? A lot of what I was seeing had much longer restrictions than what the place I had my blood patch done at told me (brain and spine place). 

I'm trying to take it easy, but they basically said no restrictions after 5 days. Not even take it easy on lifting heavy/bending. I did have coffee (1/3 caf), because they said I could/should, which was also opposite other things, and that didn't seem to be a problem.

While I'm being a little more careful than that, I'm trying to figure out how long I should actually be careful on, particularly with everyday things (feeding my dogs, doing laundry/dishes, etc.), along with being careful with how I sleep (while I usually wake up on my back, I prefer going to sleep on my side, with my legs separated in a way that twists my spine).

Any thoughts?

For more information: it was for a suspected, not confirmed, leak. I didn't have a headache, but I was dealing with various degrees of facial pressure, ongoing from a fall 4.5 years ago. Yet to be determined how much it's helped, because I've spent a lot of time resting over the weekend since my back feels tired, and usually it's towards the end of the day when/if it gets bad. My nose still hurts, but the overall pressure has seemed to be not as bad, but that could be wishful thinking. Haha.",1,1733723673.0,CSFLeaks,0,1.0,False

I had to move states due to family reasons, was told I was able to get a transfer to a location close-ish to where my apartment would be.

fast forward to about 3 ish weeks (give or take a few days) before my move I hadn’t heard anything from my manager, aside from “I’ll have more information on it when they get back with me. Anyways she ended up telling me that I couldn’t get my transfer as no one was accepting transfers. 
Obviously I couldn’t stay, but she told me I needed to work out a two weeks or I’d be black listed but there was no way for me to work out a two weeks. I ended up finding a job at target and they had me working at tarbucks. I’ve since left tarbucks (worked out a two weeks) but really miss being a barista and would like to work at a standalone Starbucks as I have 4+ years of training. 1 year at a stand alone, and the rest at tarbucks. And then technically 2 years at a small convenience store that “proudly served” Starbucks lol. I’m just wondering if blacklists are forever or if they drop off after a little? I’m also going to start applying to coffee shops too but any answers are helpful!! Thank you sm! 



Also I want to make note, I did reach out to surrounding stores and they said they never were contacted about a transfer.

How to Enjoy Water if You Don’t Like the Taste  
If plain water isn’t appealing, here are some simple and fun ways to make it more enjoyable:  

💧Add a splash of flavor-Drop in slices of lemon, lime, orange, cucumber, or even a few berries like strawberries or blueberries.  
💧Try herbal teas- Brew caffeine-free teas, like chamomile or peppermint, and drink them hot or cold.  
💧Use sparkling water-Unsweetened sparkling water provides the fizz you might love from soda but keeps you hydrated.  
💧infuse overnight-Add fruit (like pineapple or watermelon) and herbs (like mint or basil) to a pitcher of water and let it sit in the fridge. By morning, you’ll have naturally flavored water.  
💧Make it icy:** Cold water can feel more refreshing. Add ice cubes made with fruit or herbs for a creative twist.  

These tweaks make it easier to stay hydrated while cutting back on less effective drinks like caffeine and diet sodas. It’s all about finding what works for you!


Caffeinated drinks like coffee, tea, and diet sodas, as well as regular sodas, are not great for hydration for several reasons:  

1. -Caffeine-Acts as a diuretic, which makes your body lose water by increasing urination. This means you might end up losing more fluids than you gain from drinking these beverages.  
2. -Artificial Sweeteners in Diet Drinks-While they don't contain calories, they can confuse your body’s thirst signals and don’t replace the pure hydration your body needs. Some people also experience digestive upset from artificial sweeteners.  
3. -sugary Sodas or Sweetened Teas- These can leave you feeling more thirsty because sugar can dehydrate you further, and they often add empty calories without real hydration benefits. 


At the end of the day . You're an adult.  Drink water.  Who cares if you don't absolutely enjoy your experiences.  I don't even giving myself a shot or taking 12 pills a day , but I do it.  With a glass of water. ",3,1733722341.0,diabetes_t2,1,0.8,False

I can’t stand greetings and goodbyes too, never did, and lately I’ve been visibly twitching when I see acquaintances cause I sense the impending doom. Some of them are now convinced I hate them. I tried to explain once that greetings are a waste of time and a boring one and was called dumb.  
  
Desperate to stay sane I’m starting clowning, saying random shit, telling about special interests when these tedious social situations occur. Pretty sure service stuff spits in my coffee now, and I’ve been called weird couple times, and co-workers think I don’t respect them (I don’t, but not greeting isn’t a proof of that).

Hey everyone this is brit, 
Diagnosed autistic girl age 32.

about being autistic I want everyone to know that For all the bad, I still would not give it up. I would suffer 100 years of meltdowns, overload, executive dysfunction and alll the bad for even just one day of being autistic and the autistic perspective. For the beautiful feel of a smooth cool pebble in my palm, for the contentment and comfort I feel when engaging with my special interests and the big warm bubble that opens in my chest. For the peace and perfect serenity and ovewhelmeing joy I feel when I discover a new stim and know it will be with me forever sitting perfectly within me for eternity. For the light rainbows that dance through the air and the pure beauty in every single museum and gallery. For the warmth and comfort and complete wonder I feel at the beauty of the inside of a coffee shop, the dim lights creating a feel of home while at the same time being perfectly different, the most nutty smell of a warm latte between my fingers the foam on my lips that tastes like the sweetest most perfect soft cloud. For the way that the white noise of a hard rain or the sound of ocean waves or feel of grass between my bare toes is overwhelming in the best way possible. For the perfect joy music brings me and how each note seems to resonate within the deepest parts of my soul. For the comfort I feel when I am shopping for more stim toys and engaging in my special interests. For the strength and confidence I feel when talking about my experience and engaging in autism advocacy work. For the joy and pride i feel when I see the smile on another autistic person who I have helped find a stim toy or a neurodiversity positive resource that has changed their life for the better. I would suffer all the bad a hundred times over because the good far outweighs it. I just want to help others see and appreciate that and stop trying to change it.

I love mornings and the smells and sounds of it. A slow cup of warm coffee and light breakfast can help me tackle so many things by noon. Brain is so *sufficiently active*. I’m not against physical activity. I love evening exercise routines, just before dinner. What I really cannot handle are morning walks. Even an early morning sunlight is too much, too sharp and prolonged during the walk and it is draining me out of my precious limited energy that I need to go by the day. This also forcibly wakes up my senses and my muscles everywhere start to tingle. Then Restless Leg Syndrome kicks in messing up my day and probably night too. The whole day’s focus is sacrificed.

Been using Sports Research's MCT oil for about 3 months now, and I'm honestly impressed enough to break my Reddit silence.

Quick background: I've been doing keto for about 2 years, and MCT oil has been a daily staple. I've tried everything from the bargain brands to the premium stuff, and most either taste like straight-up coconut (which I'm not a fan of) or have this weird chemical aftertaste that ruins my morning coffee.

What makes this one different:

* The taste is practically non-existent. My partner, who's super sensitive to any weird flavors in coffee, actually asked if I forgot to add my MCT oil one morning. That's how neutral it is.
* The energy boost is noticeably smoother. No sudden jitters or crash like I've experienced with other brands.
* It's purely coconut-based, no palm oil (which was a huge selling point for me after reading about palm oil sustainability issues)

Real talk about my experience: I mix about a tablespoon into my morning coffee, and it keeps me focused through my morning meetings without getting hangry. Used to get these weird afternoon energy dips with other brands, but this one keeps me steady. My friend who's also on keto tried it and immediately ordered her own bottle - she says it's the first MCT oil that doesn't upset her stomach.

Price-wise, it's middle of the road at around $27 for a 32oz bottle. Not the cheapest, but given how long it lasts and the quality, I think it's worth it. I actually ended up saving money because I'm using less - the C8/C10/C12 blend seems more effective than the cheaper stuff I was using before.

Minor gripes? The bottle could use a better pour spout - I've had a few close calls with my measuring spoon. Also, if you're new to MCT oil, start slow. This is potent stuff (learned that the hard way, if you know what I mean).

Bottom line: **Sports Research Keto MCT Oil** is genuinely the best keto MCT oil I've tried, and I've probably tried most of them at this point. It's clean, effective, and doesn't mess with the taste of my drinks. If you're tired of playing MCT roulette, give this one a shot.

Anyone else try this brand? Curious about your experiences, especially if you've been using it longer than I have.",3,1733721735.0,MyConsumerReviews,0,1.0,False

Like is it OK to have coffee in the morning and breakfast etc? (Haha - “breakfast” - more like plain yogurt and part of a banana - 🙄)

Thanks, and wish me luck! I know it can take months to kick in - and my G.I. is letting me overlap and stay on budesonide for another four or five weeks since it’s helping so much (and I have only been on it for five days so far this time around.)

1ha2isr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/1ha2isr/what_is_the_value_of_bitcoin/,"What is the ""Value"" of Bitcoin?","Full disclosure: I'm on the fence when it comes to bitcoin. I visit all the pro-bitcoin subs as well as this one to gather as much information as I can.  In my tavels I have noticed that my questions in the pro-bitcoin subs either go insufficiently answered, unanswered, or worse; deleted by mods. I have had a conversation here in this sub in the past and been taught far more through that interaction than I have at any pro-bitcoin sub. I've also noticed that this sub has a lot of pro-bitcoin visitors that seem to know everything and like to tell us how smart they are so I figured I'd ask my question here to see if I can get a balanced answer to my question.    
  
This is the one that was deleted by mods over at bitcoinbeginners. (I've modified it slightly to correct some mistakes)  
  
Some time ago, I bought some Bitcoin. Not much, just enough to be ""in the game"". Now I see my investment doing well I'm actually DYORing (yeah, it's all backwards) and I'm trying to get a satisfying answer to the question: why is Bitcoin valuable?  
I've googled, I've watched Youtube videos, I've read loads of Reddit posts, I've asked around and I'm never really satisfied with the answers. It just isn't clicking for me.

It's scarce. The definition of scarce states that there must be a limited supply of something that has an unlimited need/want from people. Yes, Bitcoin is limited, but why would anyone need/want it?

It's a currency. Not really. Any time I hear of anyone spending it, it is converted to local currency then spent. Ie, your still buying at the cost set at the local currency value. Nothing costs X bitcoin. I could sell my hat on Facebook marketplace to make the money I need for a coffee - that doesn't make hats a kind of currency.

It's like gold. Is it? I can't make a necklace from it, I can't make a tooth out of it.  
There is no desire to buy Bitcoin other than the idea that it might be nice to have Bitcoin in case it keeps going up. The only value I can see is that it is valuable because it is valuable. How long can that possibly last?

Additional thoughts (not part of the original post): perhaps bitcoins value lies in the future? Is Bitcoin just solving a problem that doesn't exist yet? Is government owned currency destined to fail within our lifetime?

I don't know what to do anymore.,"I guess the best place for me to start is probably 2021 when I (currently 25F) moved into my boyfriend's house. He said I could move in and then apply for jobs. I would clean, fix up the house, cook, and apply to at least 3 jobs a day. (Let's call him) ""Enzo"" (currently 29M)  was really mad at the fact that I hadn't gotten a job yet after 2 weeks. I was reading a book on the couch, when he came in and yelled at me. He then recommended me to one of his prior jobs. I then started working as a dietary aide at a retirement home. By that time COVID had just began. There was a big breakout at my work in particular so I was working practically everyday and would work doubles (6-6) often. Meanwhile he worked only Wednesdays with full pay. I would come home to the coffee table covered in beer cans. He would ask for people to come over but refused to clean the house. When prompted I said I didn't feel comfortable having company over with the house being a mess. After that he told everyone that I was controlling and that I didn't want him to be around anyone. I didn't have a car at the time because I didn't have any savings. I had just started working. He was very mean to me because I ""put him out"" by him constantly driving me to work. At one point him and his buddies threw a g** in the front seat of his truck and shouted at my window for me to k*** myself in the middle of the night. It was still sitting there when I went to work. He still denys that happened to this day. But that was months after the initial issues. They all would talk trash about me behind my back and he would be all too happy to tell me that no one likes me. Then when he would ask me to go to parties I would say that I didn't want to and then he would refuse to go until I went because ""they would ask why I wasn't with him"" I told him to say I was tired from work. But he still refused to go at times. In hindsight that was more fuel for the fire. He would tell them that I was keeping him from going. When I would go to the parties people would talk about me. When I felt uncomfortable and said I wanted to leave Enzo would make me feel like I was ruining his night. Often he wouldn't let me go until he was done drinking. One night while at his friend's house a girl I was trying to be nice to kept goading me to open up and when I felt uncomfortable and went to the truck she kissed Enzo. Telling him that he should be with a ""real woman"". The breaking point for me was when Enzo called me a bitch and told me he hated me while on the phone with his mom. That night we fought till 3 am despite me working the next day. We agreed that I would still pay half the rent and stay in the spare room. My personal life was a mess and everyone that I was surrounded by treated me like garbage. I went on dating sites and friend meeting sites. I also joined tik Tok and posted a few risque things for attention. I never posted anything more revealing than a bikini though. Everyone started calling me a whore. Also I had only slept with Enzo at the time. My behavior drove Enzo over the edge. Any friends that I had he would have to approve of. He would yell at me, demand to see my passwords, ask me every minor detail of my day, etc. I would do anything to not go home. Taking extra work shifts, I even tried out several bar scenes and found one that I liked. But Enzo even started bringing his friends to my spot. He refused to let me go on dates and would show up when I would go anywhere without him. When I would come home all I would do is drink. I hated coming home. Enzo would start fights, take my keys, look through my phone, stand in front of my vehicle that I recently bought when I would try to leave. We often went in a cycle that involved him apologizing and attempting to get back together then him being mean to me again, talking trash about me, his family goading him on, me trying to talk to him about it and then breaking up again because he refused to change. This continued until I had a miscarriage. His brother (25M) was telling me in the truck that I should have been with him instead when I thought I felt my period. I ran inside and went on the toilet. When I looked down I saw a baby the size of a nickel, took a picture of it and asked to talk to Enzo outside. I showed him the picture and he got mad at me because I didn't wait until after his brother and cousin left. I went to my room crying and they went on a beer run. I broke a piggy bank that said ""our adventure fund"" sat there sobbing. He walked into the room and got mad at me for making a mess and closed the door. His brother helped me clean up and showed me demon slayer. I got trashed and started talking about all the people that had died around me. Not my best moment. The morning after Enzo asked how he knew I wasn't lying. I told him that if I wasn't maybe a pregnancy test would show up positive. It did. He sort of apologized. Kinda like ""sorry, but"" situation. I cried for a week straight. Not long after this I switched jobs and met a man there. He flirted with me. It felt nice to be desired. Meanwhile Enzo had my passwords so he saw everything. Everything that we sent each other. He was livid. I then found out the man was married and bought into the whole ""I'm leaving her."" Situation. Enzo constantly tried to convince me to leave him and ""we can be together."" Eventually I bought in. During this time he hit me twice. He choked me out while we were being intimate to the point I almost passed out. Him and his friend ""A""(25M) punched me in the stomach full force repeatedly because I said it didn't hurt. There was also another event where Enzo called the ambulance because I hit my head on the coffee table and started vomiting. I'm not sure I should mention what I thought happened because I had a bottle of vodka and I'm not 100% sure I remember it properly. He said he would marry me. That night we brought friends over and we got $#@+faced with tequila. I broke my ribs. After that Enzo said he felt pressured to marry me that he didn't actually want to. My confidence broke. I felt like a complete idiot. Nobody wanted me. Not even him. Shortly after this I had a radical experience with Jesus. He saved me. But there were still times that I wondered whether Enzo was going to kill me. I called my dad and asked him to pick me up. He did and I went and stayed with them. But after a few days the incessant calling and texts made me come back to Enzo. It was early July 2022. I want to say either the 8th or the 6th. I was at his house sitting in the pool. He handed me an opened beer and I drank it. He told me A and ""c"" were kayaking and forgot their keys in the other car down the river. He kept asking me to go, over and over again. I kept saying I didn't want to. He would pretend he was leaving then getting out of the truck. It had been an hour at this point. He told me that he would give me some w*** and that I could just ride along. I told him I was going to change clothes and I waited in the room for over an hour hoping he would leave. He didn't. I finally got in the truck, we went to circle k for a drink and then we started driving. I noticed he was acting really weird. When we got there Enzo got out of the truck and helped load the kayaks into the truck. Then they stopped to talk. They all looked at me the same time with somber faces. They must have been talking about me. Then they got in the truck and started making comments that were pretty concerning. Hinting at how they'd kill someone. I asked ""you guys aren't going to kill me or anything right?"" 
C then said ""no we're not like women who will poison you for years or anything like that."" ""At least it'll be quick."" I then saw A say he needed to charge his phone but I was wondering if he was recording me. I felt like I was panicking a bit. Enzo just looked at me with mock sympathy and said ""it's just a phone."" I then heard a click behind me. My heart was beating out of my chest. I was writing to my female coworker. Telling her where they were hinting at hiding my body. My finger was on send. If anything happened, someone would know. Just then an oar fell out of the truck they tried to turn around but someone ran it over. I then waited until they got to the main part of the city before telling him to let me out. Enzo kept suggesting that he let me out at the house. I knew better. I got out and I started to feel funny. Terror seeped into my veins and I started sobbing. I kept telling him to go and finally he did because we were making a scene. I started praying that God deliver me. He did. I talked to police. They called an ambulance and the emts told me I was tachicardic. After getting to the hospital I didn't really trust anyone to take me home. I didn't know who all was in on it or what. I admitted myself to a mental health facility. I figured maybe I needed to ensure that I wasn't crazy. Sometimes I still wonder. Enzo was the only one to visit me. To bring me clothes, a Bible. My experience there felt safe at least but it was boring. Sleep, TV room. Or hanging out in the cafeteria were the only options. You don't realize how much you use your phone until you can't have it. I had a seizure because of the medicine they put me on and Enzo picked me up in the waiting room of the hospital. I didn't even get seen. At that point I was just greatful to leave and get some decent food. I got on medication and went back home. Something told me to look at my MyChart and I did. I had benzos in my system the day the ambulance took me. I knew for a fact I didn't have anything other than the beer and w*** drink Enzo gave me. It snapped that maybe I wasn't that crazy. They might've actually been trying to k*** me. Enzo denied d***ing me over and over again. When asked how they got in my system he asked if I took them. It was maddening. I couldn't prove anything. Fast forward I move into my sister's trailer and start seeing a guy. I was at his house for a little get together. Enzo called me 13 times yelling and screaming at me, going back and forth about how I'm a bitch and how hard his life is. Id feel bad except everyone that was there heard and saw his behavior. He then drove to the guys apartment, found my car and threw stuff in it. He would call my sister for hours every night whining and crying about me. Saying that his house is haunted. Asking if he could go into the trailer I was renting because technically it was hers. Eventually she told me to deal with it. I unblocked him and told him not to call her anymore. He was whining. I didn't really feel that much remorse for him at this point. But well things progressed and he weaseled his way back in. He got me drunk one night and I told him he could sleep on the couch... He did not. I cried after. He would try to help me with things, like my washer, and frozen pipes. He was what I knew. I knew what to expect. Me and my sister fought. She claimed it was because of the heating situation but really it was because ""he got his hooks in again."" I wasn't coming around again. Isolating. Etc. I moved to my parents house and he got me pregnant. Other than demeaning comments like ""aren't you glad I still find you attractive."", finding a bucket of used condoms that he claimed were his brothers, him claiming that his mom wanted a paternity test, constant fighting and about a million tears, things were mildly okay. I didn't really trust him at all and was really paranoid. I refused to drink anything he gave me unless he tried it first. Still do. But I knew that at least while I was pregnant he wouldn't hurt me. He was really distant near the end of the pregnancy trying to go on trips and didn't want to be around as much. I wanted him to be there in case I went into labor. I was having really bad Braxton hicks near the end to the point that when I was actually in labor I couldn't tell the difference. They demanded I go to thanksgiving and my mom asked if she and my brother could come to so I asked if that'd be okay. They said yes. The day of I really didn't want to go because I hadn't gotten any sleep and was having a lot of practice contractions. I was in no mood to adhere to the perfect standards that everyone expected of me. I hung out ate, said thank you. Went into the living room, and tried to relax. Apparently that had already pissed cc off. Saying that I was being disrespectful. But the fact that I went to the car to decompress and then we went home because my contractions were less than a minute apart. Unforgivable. Anyway I finally go in to give birth they give me miso and pitocin to speed things along my sister comes to support me before labor gets too far along. Things are good. I get to about 4 cm dilated and around 9 hours of labor before I decide that I need the epidural. Then my baby starts d sating they try to move and adjust me all through the night trying different options before they tell me I might have to consider a c section. I start having a panic attack. Enzo called my mom and sister to pray. My sister decides to come over. By the time she gets there I start feeling like I have to poop. They then tell me that I'm 9.5 centemeters dilated. I'm panicking and Enzo is just sitting there in shock. I give birth in a matter of minutes. Enzo cuts the cord. Then texts people that they have a grandson. Cc calls pissed. She wanted to be there at the hospital while I gave birth but not in the room evidently. In the waiting room. She's yelling at him apparently, not even 10 minutes after I give birth Enzo asks for a paternity test. I told him that I wasn't going to force anyone to be in his life. The entire time at the hospital Enzo treats me like garbage Enzo doesn't let me get any sleep ensuring that I only get an hour here or there before waking me up. He doesn't want to help with diapers or swaddles or help me with showering or moving. His sister comes over and says he looks like a white little old man. I'm white but Enzo is Hispanic. I guess they were expecting my son to look more like the dad. He says he'll walk her to her car and when he comes back he smugly tells me that she doesn't think ""E"" (our son) is his. The next day I call my parents for advice and put I block on my room because I'm tired of this treatment. He gets through because he has E's car seat. I get a lengthy message from cc about how she doesn't care if she's not in E's life but not to keep Enzo away. About how I was ""torturing him"". It was a joke. The nurse came to check on me and sent my mom and Enzo out of the room. Apparently he told her that this was ""all my fault."". I still let him stay after that. E became really jaundice and tested combs positive. He had his dad's blood type A+ while I had O+. My blood cells were attacking Es. They sent him to the NICU and those 7 days were horrible. I woke up the first night in tears because I dreamed that I was holding my baby and woke up to him gone. I can't explain it, but I don't wish that feeling on any mother. The messages and drama from cc continued. I would ask Enzo what was going on and he would kinda just give me a non answer or tell me that I was driving him nuts for always asking. He'd act like he was the only one struggling. On my birthday he told me that they banned me from their house. Of course he had to wait till then. He would make sure to answer his mom's calls away from me so I didn't hear anything. We agreed to split the 20th and the 21st I told him to go hang out with friends. I gave him the opportunity to come back but he didn't take it. I then kicked him out. From then on out he constantly tried stressing me out. ""Everyone is calling you a whore."" ""Why won't you do the paternity test?"". ""This person said this about you."" Eventually I gave in and got him one from Walgreens. Surprise surprise E was 99.99 % likely to be his son. Then he would suggest cabbage for nipple pain or whine about sleeping alone, and how bad his mom is. He admitted to talking crap about me on Christmas. Every single visit was just drama. I'll admit it. I hated him. He was making me start to feel crazy. One night he begged to stay over an grabbed my privates while I was sleeping. I woke up horrified. I attempted visits with his family but each time it ended horribly. His mom insulting my mother. Making up false accusations about how I was mean to her. Saying that I had to make visits with them or I would get in trouble with the courts. His grandfather told me he was going to call the state on me if I didn't go visit him (he lives 2 hours away) at least 2x a month. I got in my car and cried the whole way home. He's very careful about text messages. But honestly all of this is driving me to the brink. I'm having mental breakdowns. I don't know if that's because of therapy, drama, being a single parent, past trauma. Etc. I heard my dad and mom talking to him the other day about if anything happened to me if Enzo would step in and take care of E. Everytime I try to talk to my parents they say that I don't have it that bad and that I'm victimizing myself. I tried talking to my dad and after I left the room he said ""cry me a river."" My sister also hinted that I shouldn't have become a mother, I've been trying to get to the bottom of it but everyone is treating me like I'm crazy... It seems like everyone has come against me overnight. I don't know what to do I'm lost. I'm starting to wonder if I am crazy. I know I always take care of E properly. So why is everyone treating me like this? I breastfeed even though it's more painful than childbirth. He always has food, Clothes, diapers, he's always cleaned properly, he has toys, I try to foster relationships with friends and family so that he knows connections. I don't know what I'm missing....

**Location: Texas**

I would like to become a ""findom"" where I have people buy me coffee gift cards and in exchange I email them a picture of the coffee and a handwritten thank you note with their name on it next to the coffee picture.

If you do not know what a ""findom"" is, please look it up. It is only for coffee purchases in my case.

I have several friends that do this, but I am not sure if they are going about this the correct way and I want to make sure everything I am doing is correct and legal.

**Therefore, I have a few questions.**

>(1) I use the website ""Throne"" for the gift cards. **Do I need to report me receiving gift cards for my taxes if they are Starbucks gift cards and going directly to coffee?** *I think the answer is yes, and once it hits the $600 mark. My friends are telling me no.*  


>(2) **Do I need to avoid having minors give me a Starbucks gift card?** All they get in exchange is a picture of the coffee and a handwritten thank you note with their name on it next to the coffee from me. They do not get a picture from me. ***STILL***. Because some consider ""findom"" a fetish, I do not think minors should be involved. **How do I avoid this and getting into any potential trouble?**  


>(3) Aside from not doing this at all, **what is the best way to keep myself legally safe?** Any advice is welcome. I want to make sure I am being as legal, safe, and ethical as possible.

I smelled the og khamrah and liked it but when I gave it to smell it to one of my female friend, she said it smells good but like some cheap female makeups and smells very ordinary. Hearing that and thru many others on the internet about how feminine it this, I decided to go for Qahwa with the hype going around.

The first impression was pretty bad with harsh synthetic like smell of ginger which was almost buring my nose. The dry down was good but due to the opening I was starting to regret my decision and then I found out about maceration. I gave it a few spray and let it sit in a cool dark place sometimes leaving it for a week without using it and oh boy does it make a difference. I didn't believe in these maceration stuffs but it was a night and day different, the harshness of the opening reduced by like 80-90%. 

Smell: Opens with a warm spicy smell with a small hint of coffee(almost smells like chocolate with ginger and other spices). Also smells lil boozy for few mins, idk how as there's no any notes mentioned for this.

Middle notes are also quite similar with lesser spice. (One of friend who's not much into fragrances said it smelled like coconut 😭 )

Base note is my favourite part about this fragrance with like warm, spicy vanilla's smell. A 10/10 base note.

Performance: Amazing performance, I have a decant of jpg elixir and I feel this has almost or if not even better performance. I could still smell it in a room where I sprayed it a day before. 
I once, sprayed once on my sweater before going on a concert around 4pm and my friend could smell small hints of it from like 3 feets away the next day (around 9am). So easy 7-8 hours on skin.

Projection: I don't have much experience with this as I've been mostly staying home after I bought it, but once I sprayed like 3 sprays around my neck and my friends were smelling it even from like 3 feets away even after a bike ride(which was almost after an hour)

Versatility: It isn't versatile, I would def recommend it to wear it only in winter esp in evening where it really shines with that sweet smell. In a hot sunny day, it might burn your nose and everyone's nose around you with the spices.

[Original Post](https://www.askamanager.org/2024/07/an-industry-colleague-is-lying-to-me-about-a-dispute-we-had-years-ago.html)  **July 10, 2024**


Six years ago, I was vice president of the board of a national advocacy body (Org A) that had a long-standing, mostly good, relationship with another national advocacy body (Org B). The two organizations had some commonalities but also quite well defined swim lanes.

While I was VP for Org A, Elsa from Org B had approached me and asked if I could be on a voluntary advisory group they were convening. Elsa assured me it had nothing to do with my board role at Org A, and it was a group of independent experts in the industry, with Org B just providing a secretariat. My board eventually agreed it wasn’t a conflict of interest so I joined.

Two weeks after the first expert meeting, Org A voted to resign their associate membership in Org B, in response to a disagreement about Org B’s new approach to something, although I think they just disliked Sven, the CEO, and decided to try and force some sort of change within the organization. I didn’t agree with the resignation but was overruled by a majority vote.

The day after the resignation was announced, I got an automated email saying Elsa had removed my access to the online platform being used by the expert group. I sent a couple of emails seeking to clarify if this was a tech issue or related to the resignation, but got no response.

Three days later, Elsa called me. She was on speaker with Sven. They confirmed I had been removed from the expert group, then proceeded to scream at me and tell me I was compromising my personal values by staying on the board of Org A. I calmly said that professionalism and kindness were two of my values, and that I would end the call if they continued to yell. They kept yelling so I hung up. I was shaken but chalked it up to Elsa and her team being unprofessional.

Two weeks later, the board chair of Org B called me and asked me to join their board, because they thought I had a useful skill set. I respectfully declined — partly because it was a conflict, and partly because I didn’t want to be managing Sven, who thinks it’s okay to yell at people and question their integrity.

Two years later I get a job with an organization that funds some of the work undertaken by Org B. I declared our previous history to my new CEO during the interview process, who wasn’t bothered — she understands it’s a big industry! I also resigned from Org A around the same time, because that was a conflict. I ended up meeting Elsa for a coffee when I started my new job, as we had to work together occasionally, and she apologized for how she had treated me during that phone call and we all moved on.

I’ve been in my current role four years and have a cordial relationship with Org B and Elsa. Org B has a reputation as being difficult to work with and they regularly have “reset” meetings with other organizations across the industry when they behave poorly, but I have generally gotten on well with their team since that apology.

Fast forward to today…

Elsa emailed the group of experts from the original panel, including me, asking us to share our experiences of the panel as a case study for successful cross-industry collaboration. I replied to Elsa and asked if she was sure I should be included because they had removed me from the group very early on.

She’s just replied and said, “Oh no, you were removed at the request of Org A, didn’t you know that? It was nothing to do with us. Love your work!”

Alison, this just … didn’t happen. I was the VP at the time, I would have known about that request, and my board was just as shocked as I was about what had happened. But … I can’t prove anything. The board has changed over, I no longer have access to those emails from that time, and it’s their word against mine.

Elsa and I have a previously scheduled coffee for next week to discuss a new funding proposal and I don’t know what to do. Do I ignore the email and pretend nothing ever happened? Do I cancel the coffee on some pretext? Do I respond to correct the record? I just don’t know.


[Update](https://www.askamanager.org/2024/12/updates-diet-coke-as-a-religious-accommodation-coworker-loves-shoplifting-and-more.html)  **Dec 2, 2024 (5 months later)**

Oh boy do I have an update. Buckle up!

I took your advice and filed the interaction as “intel about Elsa.” The coffee got cancelled because her kids were sick, we never rescheduled it, and I never heard anything more about the case study. While I dreamed of doing a “mic drop” moment, I decided to be the bigger person here.

And then … my organization got restructured, and while my job is safe, I have been seconded to a different organization in the same industry. It’s a great development opportunity and I’m mostly enjoying it. Except…

For the last few months, I have been working with Elsa on a joint application for federal funding for the program I work for. The whole way through, she and Sven were very clear that they wanted to partner with us. I would have preferred we didn’t, given Elsa and Sven’s past behavior, but it was already in train when I arrived so it was a case of sucking it up.

The day after the deadline for funding applications closed, I got an email from the funder asking for clarification about the two applications. At which point, my brain exploded.

Sven and Elsa have put in a separate funding application for the same project. They took the information we shared in good faith, undercut the partnership, and made it sound like the partnership was submitted under duress, when we have emails and texts to the contrary.

My CEO saw red and contacted their board, who had no idea that Sven had put the application in. In fact, they’d just congratulated Sven on his efforts to collaborate with us! When cornered, Sven apparently said he was “covering his bases, and it’s not personal.”

So now the future of our funding (and my job) is in jeopardy, I spend half my day screenshotting emails and writing file notes for every interaction with Sven and Elsa, and I’ve come to the conclusion that they missed their callings as Shakespearian-level actors. It’s a crazy world…

Thoughts on Coworking Spaces and Book Cafés?,"I’m considering starting a **coworking space** or **book café** here in Butuan City, I'm not a native of Butuan and would love to hear your thoughts! 

As someone passionate about creating a productive space in what feels like a booming city for VAs, freelancers, and remote workers, I want to ensure the idea aligns with the community's needs.

Here are a few questions I’d love your feedback on:

# For Remote Workers, Students, and Freelancers:

1. Do you think Butuan needs a coworking space? If yes, what amenities would you expect (e.g., fast Wi-Fi, comfy chairs, free coffee, generator for outages)?
2. Would you pay for a monthly membership or prefer hourly/day passes? How much would you consider reasonable?
3. If a coworking space was only accessible by car but had free parking, would that work for you?

# For Café Enthusiasts and Book Lovers:

1. Would you visit a cozy book café with free access to books, coffee, and snacks?
2. What books, drinks, or snacks would make you come back regularly?
3. Should the café also host events like self-development seminars, skill-based workshops, or study groups?

# For Everyone:

1. What’s the biggest challenge in finding a space to work and study in Butuan?
2. Are there specific areas in Butuan that are ideal for something like this?

So for the last month and a half I've had deserts/drinks for 4 weeks and curry's the other 2 weeks so I've been running a team primarily to get me the ingredients to make early bird coffee jelly & dizzy punch spicy curry since I have both of them close to level 30 and get the most strength making those but even tho my Wartortle is good, I've been kinda running low on milk. I got this Vaporeon today and I hear that they're pretty good so I'm just wondering if I should put this guy in the game since I just evolved one of my Charjabugs into Vikavolt and he's been killing it getting me coffee so I could probably bench my other Charjabug I've been running to get more milk and more ingredients in general when Vaporeon triggers.

My sister woke me up and told me that she and her boyfriend would be willing to help me get my kitty to the clinic for her rabies shot. The shot was a reduced price and the roads were awful but they have four wheel drive with nicer tires. I am the complete opposite right now in the car department. We got our stuff together and put the kitty in the cage. She did not want to get into the cage and she has never been like that. I don't blame her though and I get it is scary. We were on our way. We had to make a couple stops for my sister and then we got to the clinic. The kitty did so well and peed on her pee pad which helped to reduce how much got on her fur. She did such an amazing job getting there yowling just a few times. Then getting the shot and everything was quick and easy. She sat still like the good baby she is. We ran to get burger for tomorrow's cheat day and I showed one of my coworkers my cat. He absolutely adored her and called her a big girl just like the nurse. The worst part is she is so active and doesn't even get fed too much. The cage is so awkward to hold making it seem like she is super chunky. I'll look into it just in case though. My sister ran to get coffee and matcha and even got me a drink and a bagel. I decided to drink the drink despite it being a bit too many calories and saved the bagel for tomorrow. I didn't want to overindulge, especially when we have dinner coming and I think I heard whispers of pretzels. It's hard though because it's so sweet she got it for me but I can't mindlessly just take in all that. I have to be smart about it when I can. I think holding the bagel for when my cheat day is is a good compromise. On the way home, the baby fell asleep and I was very happy she was able to rest. After a few hours of being home, we headed to my cousin's house. We went to see both their new home and new dog. He was absolutely adorable and my goodness I loved every bit of him. After seeing him, I then helped my uncle and cousin carry a bunch of boxes to a spare room. I always like helping them out because they treat me like a person who matters. They treat me with hospitality and make me feel at home. After that we went to my cousin's house down the driveway and I got to see inside his new place with his longtime girlfriend. It looked great and had a nice new little pad for the pup. I played with the baby and eventually my cousin's friends came to hang out. We then went to the house and had a make your own pretzel night. I haven't had pretzels in forever and made one too many. Throughout the night I had three in total while hanging out with family and friends. I got to have many different conversations with my uncle, cousin, and other people. I worked on writing different things when I was just minding my own business and just enjoyed my time. I passed out in one of their comfortable chairs until we went back to my cousin's house. Probably fell asleep as well from a carb crash. We went there where I played some Peglin and then I joined in on Quiplash even winning the second round I played in. It was a fun time and eventually everybody went to bed. I got some more puppy play time and loved every bit of it. It was a good day. I was definitely a bit bold on food but tried to make good choices by not consuming too much. My only mistake was I should have put the third pretzel down or never even made it. Of course though, this was the best one I made and it was the last. I had a rest day today as well because I was super tired from exercising back to back for quite a few days. I can tell you one thing though and that is a puppy is a great workout as well. Despite that here is what I ate or drank:

Breakfast:

Gingerbread Chai Latte - 300 - 400 calories (~8 g protein)

Note: Based on a rough estimate of Starbucks drinks.

Snack:

1 piece of a stromboli - ~400 - 600 calories (~15 to 25 g protein) 

Note: Very hard to tell. I calculated a stromboli my old coworkers made for me and got a very high number. But she packed it with a lot of sausage for me. It was delicious but disgustingly high in calories. I ate tiny pieces at a time. This stromboli didn't seem as filled, seemed less cheesy, and had more meatballs than anything else lacking much sausage, at least in my piece. It was delicious but not like my old coworkers did. I just did it at the high end to make sure I didn't get too crazy with it. I wish I had a scale or this is also why I tend to make my own meals but I really wanted to see the house and puppy. 

Dinner:
3 homemade stuffed pretzels - ~800 - 900 calories (~18 - 24 g protein)

Note: Stuffed with a little amount of cheese, pepperoni, and hot peppers. Very little amounts but estimated high again. And accounted in here for some beer cheese that I dipped a little bit of one of my pretzels. 

SBIST was the innocence and lovability of a little puppy. Oh my goodness this golden retriever was just so happy and dopey and beautiful. It's happiness radiated onto me. That little scamp was teething and loved to nip but I'm so used to it when messing with my kitty cat. He was so full of energy and loved being able to mess with him and throw him around and have fun with him. I love puppies that have good owners. They are so much fun and knowing he has owners who will train him well makes me so happy. I played with him so much trying to tucker him out and get him to go rest. He did not give up and loved any interaction I had with him. It just made my heart so full and I was happy. 

Today was a terrible food day and typically I would count this as my cheat day instead but I promised my sister some incredible burgers and they have been hyped up so much. I'll be very good like I am usually after the following day. I have been working hard as hell and having two days in a row makes me think this is what I have been working for. I have been working towards a body where I have many days of eating well and working out. Then when I have a day or two where I don't eat as well, then it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter in the sense that I have been working hard. I have been developing this relationship with food where I feel proud and even comfortable. I feel more confident now. I feel more in control. Having two days in a row being not the best for me is okay because it won't spiral into a week and then into a month. Instead I'll be back to doing my best after tomorrow. I got this. Thank you my conjurers of the confidence. You inspire me more and more each day with fueling me to be the best me I can be.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you considering teeth whitening? Many people are curious about what to expect before and after a teeth whitening treatment. The transformation of your smile can be quite remarkable, boosting your confidence and enhancing your social interactions. Let's dive into the impact of teeth whitening and what changes you may observe through the process.

### Understanding Teeth Whitening

Teeth whitening is a cosmetic dental procedure that aims to lighten the color of the teeth. There are several methods available, including:

- In-office treatments performed by dental professionals
- At-home whitening kits with custom trays
- Over-the-counter products like strips and gels

Each method varies in effectiveness and results, but all focus on removing stains and discoloration, leading to a brighter smile.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Before Teeth Whitening: What to Expect

Before diving into the whitening process, you should consider a few key points:

- Consultation with your dentist: It's essential to have a discussion with your dental professional. They can evaluate your oral health and recommend the best whitening option for you.
- Surface stains: Many factors contribute to tooth discoloration, including diet, lifestyle choices, and natural aging. Identifying these will help in tailoring your whitening approach.
- Expectations: Set realistic goals. While many people achieve dramatic results, individual outcomes can vary based on the severity of stains and the method used.

### The Whitening Process

The whitening process typically begins with the preparation of your teeth. For in-office treatments, your dentist may use rubber dams to protect your gums and nearby tissues. In at-home kits, you will receive custom trays or pre-filled strips. The whitening agent, often hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide, is then applied to your teeth.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Depending on the method, the treatment may take anywhere from 30 minutes in the dental office to several hours over a few days at home. After this step, you might notice a significant change in your teeth's brightness.

### After Teeth Whitening: The Transformation

Once the procedure is complete, you will have a beautiful, radiant smile. Here are some changes you can expect to see:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- Increased confidence: A whiter smile can have a positive impact on your self-esteem. You may feel more comfortable smiling in social situations.
- Improved appearance: Bright, shiny teeth can enhance your overall look. This can be particularly beneficial during important events, such as weddings, job interviews, or family gatherings.
- Motivation for oral care: Many individuals who undergo whitening treatment become more conscious of their dental hygiene practices. This often leads to improved brushing and flossing habits.

### Maintaining Your Whitened Smile

While you’ll enjoy brighter teeth after the treatment, it’s essential to maintain those results. Here are some quick tips:

- Avoid certain foods and beverages: Post-treatment, it’s wise to limit your intake of coffee, red wine, and dark berries that can stain your teeth.
- Practice good oral hygiene: Regular brushing and flossing will help keep your smile radiant.
- Consider touch-ups: Over time, teeth can become stained again. Your dentist may suggest periodic maintenance treatments for sustained brightness.

### The Impact of Personal Choices

Teeth whitening not only transforms your smile but also encourages healthier habits. By making conscious choices, like quitting smoking or reducing dark beverages, you can prolong the effects of your treatment. Each choice you make now positively influences the longevity of your dazzling smile.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
For many, the journey of teeth whitening is about more than just aesthetics; it can lead to a significant psychological boost, where individuals feel empowered to present themselves confidently to the world.

Ultimately, the impact of teeth whitening before and after is profound. As most smiles become brighter, so does the outlook on life. If you're contemplating this treatment, take the steps necessary to achieve a vibrant, white smile that reflects your best self. Your smile is worth it!

Common Myths and Facts About Teeth Whitening Results
----------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening can be a game changer for your smile, but misconceptions often cloud judgment. Let's debunk some of the common myths surrounding teeth whitening results and reveal the facts. Understanding the truth can help you achieve the radiant smile you desire without falling for false claims.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Myth: Teeth Whitening Works the Same for Everyone

Many people believe that teeth whitening treatments will give everyone the same results. However, this is not true. Individual factors like the type of stain, your natural tooth color, and dental health can influence the outcome. For instance:

- **Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Stains:** Intrinsic stains come from within the teeth, often resulting from aging or trauma, while extrinsic stains are surface-level stains caused by food and drinks.
- **Enamel Thickness:** People with thinner enamel may see more sensitivity and less dramatic whitening results.

Teeth whitening products may work differently for individuals based on these factors, so it’s crucial to consult with a dental professional for optimal results.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Myth: Over-the-Counter Products are Just as Effective as Professional Treatments

While over-the-counter whitening products can help brighten your smile, they often fall short compared to professional treatments. Dentists use stronger agents that can penetrate deeper into the enamel. Key points include:

- **Higher Concentration of Whitening Agents:** Professional treatments can contain higher levels of hydrogen peroxide, resulting in quicker and more effective outcomes.
- **Customized Options:** Dentists can tailor treatments according to your unique needs, ensuring safety and effectiveness.

For substantial and noticeable results, professional teeth whitening tends to be a more reliable choice.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Myth: Teeth Whitening Can Damage Your Teeth

Many fear that whitening treatments will harm their teeth. In reality, when performed correctly, teeth whitening is safe. However, overuse or improper technique can lead to issues like:

- **Increased Sensitivity:** Some individuals may experience temporary sensitivity but this usually subsides.
- **Gum Irritation:** If the whitening agent comes into contact with gums, irritation may occur. Professional treatments minimize these risks with protective measures.

To enjoy safe and effective whitening, always follow the guidelines provided by your dentist or the product instructions.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Myth: Teeth Whitening Results are Permanent

Another common belief is that once you whiten your teeth, they will stay white forever. In fact, your teeth can stain again due to lifestyle choices. Consider the following:

- **Dietary Choices:** Consuming staining foods and drinks like coffee, red wine, and berries can diminish your whitening results.
- **Oral Hygiene Practices:** Poor dental hygiene can lead to renewed staining. Regular brushing and flossing are crucial for maintaining a bright smile.

To extend the life of your whitening results, consider touch-up treatments as needed and maintain good oral hygiene.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Myth: All Whitening Products Are Safe

It’s vital to recognize that not all whitening products on the market are created equal. Some over-the-counter options contain unsafe ingredients or lack proper instructions. Here’s how to ensure safety:

- **Choose Trusted Brands:** Look for products with the American Dental Association (ADA) seal of approval.
- **Consult Your Dentist:** Always consult with your dentist before beginning any whitening regimen to ensure it is suitable for your oral health.

Being informed can safeguard your health while achieving a dazzling smile.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Myth: You Can Whiten Your Teeth in One Session

While some treatments can yield noticeable results in one visit (like in-office whitening), achieving maximum brightness often requires multiple sessions. It’s crucial to manage your expectations. Consider the following approaches:

- **In-Office Treatments:** Professional whitening sessions generally provide more immediate results but may require follow-up appointments.
- **Take-Home Kits:** These may take longer to lighten your teeth compared to in-office methods, but they can maintain your results effectively with consistent use.

Commitment and time are essential for the best whitening results.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Understanding the facts behind teeth whitening can help you make informed decisions on your journey to a brighter smile. By dispelling these myths, you can approach teeth whitening realistically and safely, ensuring that your outcomes are as radiant as you hope.

### Conclusion

Teeth whitening can significantly transform your smile, boosting your confidence and enhancing your overall appearance. The powerful before-and-after effects are often striking, providing a visually appealing result that many seek. However, it’s essential to approach teeth whitening with clear expectations and an understanding of the process involved.

Many myths surround teeth whitening, sometimes leading people to believe that the results will be permanent or that the methods are entirely without risk. It’s important to distinguish fact from fiction. For instance, while some at-home kits might promise dramatic results, professional treatments often provide safer and longer-lasting outcomes. Acknowledging the truth about the effectiveness and limitations of teeth whitening methods allows you to make informed decisions about the best approach for your needs.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
As you consider whitening your teeth, remember that individual results can vary. Factors such as the type of staining, your dental health, and the method used all play a role in your whitening journey. The after-effects can be superb when done correctly, but it’s crucial to prioritize your oral health.

Ultimately, the journey to a brighter smile is about more than just aesthetics; it’s about feeling good in your skin and gaining the self-assurance to share your smile with the world. By understanding the impact of teeth whitening and clearing up common myths, you can embark on this journey with confidence, knowing you’re making a choice that’s both effective and safe for your long-term dental health.

3 days into the new machine, beans' dialled in but the steam wand's almost 4-5 times stronger than the Breville Dual Boiler - I've been getting nothing but foam chiffon cakes. Hopefully will be able to nail it before the year ends.

Something I realised about the process of upgraditis :

1. Choosing the machine's colour is a huge ass headache LOL - there's colours that looks timelessly good (eg. stainless steel), vs colours that are ""easier to maintain"" (e.g. black and white), vs colours that rhymes with your personality (e.g. red, blue, yellow....). A huge mental battle about ""what other people usually get for their set ups"" vs ""what vibes with me and what I like"". I ended up getting the stainless steel in honour of the brand and model's legacy.
2. Features vs Design : I love getting value for my bucks, but I'm someone with a background in design so the looks of the machine really matters to me. The sub greatly supports ECM, Profitec etc. but somehow the metal-box looks just don't fancy me. Suckers that the mini doesn't come with flow control for its price, but I personally drink medium roasts so I decided to give it up. With my interest in coffee stemming from admiring those beautiful La Marzocco machines in cafes, I was naturally drawn to La Marzocco in the end.
3. Ease of maintenance and seeking technical help : My country (Singapore) happened to have a La Marzocco office, so it's easy to seek help when things go south. I was a dumb ass when I bought my Breville from a parallel importer back then - it was about $200 cheaper, but when issues cropped up years later, they didn't accept nor help me, and neither did the official Breville office in Singapore. Lesson learnt right there to only buy from the brand itself, or from official distributors who've been around for a long time ! Also decided not to get E61s because of its mechanisms which requires more maintenance (e.g. parts lubrication).

Upgrade Journey :

2019 : Breville Dual Boiler + Breville Smart Grinder Pro

2023 : Breville Dual Boiler + Niche Zero

2024 : La Marzocco Mini-R + Niche Zero

\*\*\* So glad I took the sub's advice to upgrade grinder first!

TLDR : Thank you to everyone on the sub who accompanied me with my upgrading journey! Upgrade is real and I have to re-learn many things, but this challenge is perhaps what keeps the hobby fun and lasting after all. Buy things you love, and trust in the sub's experience of their own coffee journey!

I was looking at porn alot back then and really started to blur fantasy and reality. So.. I posted an ad for this and got a few replies back from women but some seemed sketchy, I got some insults and people calling me names and I even got replies from guys who had the gall to ask if I'd be interested in a guy even though I CLEARLY stated I was not. 

One woman's reply stood out. She said she did this for her ex boyfriend once and could do it for me if I wanted. She was sincere, had nice pictures and looked like a pretty, girl next door with a bohemian vibe. She was an art student in college. 

So, I got to her place and she was outside with a group of friends and smoking. I don't know what they knew about me but she said we'd be alone. We went in and she showed me her little studio. She really was talented! We talked about drawing because it is something I used to be interested in alot. Then she asked if we could do what we came for because she really could not hold it anymore. I gave her the money and she had me follow her to the bathroom. She said I could lie down in the tub where she had some plastic down. It was covered in dried paint splatches from some art project I guess. She said sorry it was all she had but it was all dried. She took off her shoes and put her feet on either side of the tub and squatted over me. She peed first and there was a lot. It was very cold outside and her apartment was not really that warm so her warm pee actually felt good! Then she just started pooping. I could see it coming out and the first one took a little while or seemed like it did. I very quickly realized that the reality of this fantasy was not something I was really into it. It was like I was instantly cured of this fetish. Sort of post nut clarity before it began. Too late though. I could not just leave. A small turd landed on me and I pretended not to be grossed out. She was groaning though and soon a massive one came out that I don't know how it could have fit in her! I was covered. I could hear her wiping and the toilet flush.. I guess she didn't want to just toss the toilet paper in with me. She asked if I was OK and all I could really do was give a thumbs up. She said I could clean up and shower and she'd be outside.   
She had a trashbag for the plastic sheet and some cleaning stuff for the tub. I cleaned up and showered. No matter how much I showered though, I could still smell it on me. When I came out of the bathroom, she was tidying up and offered to make me a coffee before I left and then she walked me out. 

I don't regret doing it because it cured me of my fetish, pretty much cured me of looking at porn and she was honestly a cool person who had a great vibe and I loved how uninhibitted she was about it all. She was very free spirited. ",0,1733719012.0,confessions,3,0.44,False

OP went to /r/confession to, well, [confess about something they did as a barista near a hospital:](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/s/5w7OHR7myQ)

> When nurses were rude, I would make their drinks decaf
> 
>  I worked at a busy hospital in metro Atlanta. I was a manager at their coffee/buffet/bistro. It was a great option to have besides hospital food from a cafeteria. 
> 
> Nurses with piss ass attitudes about the job they chose to do show up and start demanding things. They bitch that extra caramel drizzle or extra mocha is an upcharge.  
> 
> I do what I can to resolve it. But it's rarely successful. 
> 
> So I start fulfilling these ridiculous coffee orders with minimal up charges. I meticulously make the drink to their very snarky request....
> 
> And I make it with Decaf. 
> 
> Don't be a shit to service people.

# Jurors discuss OP’s fate

[The first user questions OP’s decaf decisions:](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/s/3wCFZYSHRC)

> are non-caffeinated medical personnel really what a hospital needs? a tired nurse could make some awful mistakes.

> OP: A tired nurse can be as mad as they want at a patient.
> 
> If the barista is that important in their ability to function, then they should have manners and be kind.

> i don't mean mad. i mean making mistakes. caffeine doesn't do anything for me, but i know a lot of people who need it to function.
> 
> don't get me wrong, i'm not endorsing their behaviour at all. i know first hand how bad these people can be. i'm just saying... keeping caffeine from someone who works long shifts and might rely on it to look after a hospitalized person properly is maybe not the way to do it.

> OP: They can bring their own caffiene.

> They bought their own caffeine but you wanted to be petty lol

> If they did….. they wouldn’t be at the hospital coffee shop ordering coffee *[downvoted]*

> I said bought, not brought. You know, as in they purchased caffeine and expected to get what they paid for. Maybe try reading lol

*[continued from the above comment about OP being petty:](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/s/Dq0vBvs8kC)

> They bought caffeine and spent the entire process complaining and being disrespectful to the person dispensing their caffeine. This isn’t a new concept. I always expect a food service employee to spit in my food if I look at them wrong—which is why I always look at them nicely. Be nice to the food service worker, don’t get your order messed up. Easy as pie.
> 
> Also, please note, buying your own caffeine is not the same as making coffee at home and bringing it to work (yes, I know that’s less feasible for hospital staff). You’re making an argument for what’s deserved here, and you’re following the same path as those shit ass nurses. You think they deserve caffeine cuz they paid for it. I think their rudeness outweighs the couple dollars they lost. *[downvoted]*

> Oh, what a noble worldview: “mess with someone’s order because they were rude.” Truly groundbreaking. Newsflash: every customer service worker deals with rude people; it’s part of the job, not an excuse to be petty. And thanks for the completely unnecessary coffee seminar, by the way.

> Coffee seminar? You’re not serious right now lmao, that’s bait

> No I wasn’t serious, it was heavy sarcasm. Did you need an /s?

[OP responds to comment about user saying they shouldn’t withhold caffeine:](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/s/Yz6D9jjr72)

> OP: When you are rude. You receive rude.

> Obviously agree and it’s not your fault at all. Just that it might lead to worse results practically.. but then again it’s not your responsibility or your fault so do what you want *[downvoted]*

> OP: I don't work in the industry anymore. I want respect for service staff.
> 
> This is confessions
> 
> I'm confessing from over a decade ago

> And that’s why when people like you go into the hospital, the nurses fuck with you, or do things to actually cause you pain.  You still haven’t figured it out have you?

[Then we get to this user, who is on the nurse’s side:](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/s/vHg2eZQ37m)

> I'm gonna be on the other side of this.
> 
> Nurses can be as rude as they fucking want.
> 
> It's not because you're a service worker.
> 
> It's because their profession is scooping human poop out of asscracks and trying to find veins for IVs in dying people whose veins are collapsed and run away.
> 
> You just make their coffee.
> 
> Know your place.

> “Know your place.”
> 
> Tells me everything about how you see the world and value in other people. I wonder how you treat retail employees…

> I treat retail workers with the same respect I'd treat my own family.
> 
> And if my own family replaced my coffee with decaf, I'd fucking disown them.
> 
> I expect a level of trust from service providers.
> 
> If I pay for a coffee, I want a COFFEE.
> 
>Not decaf.
> 
> That's fucking unforgivable.

> I bet this sounded better in your head

> No, I'm pretty sure it resonates with a lot of people.

> Haha you realized it didn’t make sense and expounded further in some screed about wanting coffee. Don’t treat people rudely and you won’t get fucked with. Welcome to the real world, buddy.

[OP writes several comments about “know your place”:](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/s/4R46E1IQWl)

> OP: We all suffer. You're not above anyone. Know YOUR place.

> You're a kitchen appliance.  Get over yourself.

> OP: Sir I work in finance
> 
> Please fucking chill

> OP: Just kidding. I don't You suck.

> OP: I also want to clarify for everyone.
> 
> I AM NOT A KITCHEN APPLIANCE.

> OP: 1. I don't work there or any where near a kitchen.
> 
> 2. I love that you justify being an ass to people that have nothing to do with why you are tired/upset/aNGry.

[OP has another slap fight:](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/s/LjhvDVUl9W)

> OP: I hope they only make your coffee decaf.
> 
> As a barista who essentially did my own home health care for my dying father and scooped poop out of his ass while I watched him lose his mind due to stage four cancer (In my house)
> 
> Go fuck yourself

> I've done that.  Twice.  Both parents.
> 
> They do it EVERY DAY.
> 
> I will refrain from fucking myself, thank you.
> 
> I have nothing but the deepest respect for professional caregivers and I owe them so much peace of mind.

> OP: As do I. But they were polite. And I wasn't their barista.

> You're comparing being a barista to being a nurse.
> 
> Please stop.

> OP: Not really. You are.

> What you did was unethical.  I'm pretty grossed out by you.

> OP: I'm just saying being a nurse doesn't give you the right to be a bitch to anyone feeding or giving you coffee.

> They might have watched several people die during one shift and you're out here whining about them not being polite about coffee.
> 
> You're something else.

> OP: Imagine if there was no coffee.

> *[slap fight continued here](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/s/kslPvG797n)*

[This user thinks OP helped kill hospital patients:](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/s/E32tYC3cYH)

> “When nurses are rude I intentionally tamper with something that will make them less aware when in life threatening situations only harming innocent sick people who’ve done nothing wrong.”
> 
> You aren’t hurting them, but you’re potentially helping to create conditions that could kill an innocent stranger.
> 
> You are infinitely worse than random nurses with shit attitudes. You’ve helped potentially actually ruined peoples lives by being so self important instead of letting shit roll off your back.
> 
> You did exactly what they did except infinitely worse with irreversible consequences that could have innocent families burying people.
> 
> It’s psychotic. I hope you get arrested someday for this kind of shit that you think is ever okay to do because of a trivial social slight.

> Arrested for not giving someone caffeine..... that's psychotic? What would be psychotic would be working healthcare workers to the point where they need stimulants or they'll hurt someone inadvertently.

> You’re right, our system is psychotic. The system does burn out nurses.
> 
> This OP will never admit it, but they indirectly caused so much patient harm doing what they did, which is so much worse than a bitchy, stressed out nurse.

> ""No, I won't blame any of the administrators, legal apparatus, lobbyists, government, or managers who have infinitely more power over the system where nurses are aparently so overworked they cannot function without copius amounts of stimulants or even the nurses themselves for failing to just not be an asshole, the bare minimum requirement for a society, no I will instead blame the powerless minimum wage barista for failing to provide enough situlants.""
> 
> Lol. Lmao even.

> I never said I don’t blame the system. You said that.
> 
> The barista isn’t powerless. They can do their job correctly and not intentionally tamper with a nurse’s drink to make them less alert in life threatening situations. What I’m saying is OP is potentially creating situations that could hurt innocent patients

> No, they did not. The hospital made the situation. The hospital has all the power. The barista merely didn't fix the situation for them.

> *[conversation continued here](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/s/hP6MvtQrUe)*

At some point, OP adds the following edit to their post:

> Edit: This was TEN years ago and a candid confession. Please stop messaging me as if I am still making coffee.  I'm not even in that industry, so every body pull your panties back out of their wad and chill. Your coffees are safe from me.

I am not, but now someone who is emotionally available to me is involved and I don’t want to hurt him. How do I bring this up to him without hurting him? Should I ask him to just be friends while I work to figure things out?

I’ve always struggled with dating. Never did it in high school, when I got to college I tried a couple apps here and there, but nothing more than a date with someone before I pretty much blew them off. During the pandemic, my mental health took a huge hit but I got therapy and bounced back from it. In the last couple of years, I can honestly say that I’ve grown to be more loving and caring towards myself, and this is probably the best my mental health has ever been. I thought maybe I was possibly ready to try dating again. 

Any time I tried before, it would usually go something like this. Start by talking with them over text a lot, trying to get to know each other a bit more on a surface level. Plan a date for coffee (low-stakes, easy to actually talk). Go to the date being nervous as all hell. Not vibe very well with things. Get home being extremely drained. Move on and not talk to them anymore (sometimes I get to a second or third date, but very rarely). I’ve become more aware of this pattern, and I don’t want to follow it again. It’s emotionally exhausting since I struggle with divulging personal things to anyone and I’m aware that keeping things bottled up is also not healthy. 

A couple months ago, I met Jamie (24M). It started off the same way, texting a bunch. We planned a date but it kept getting postponed (I got really sick, he went on a trip for work, I got sick again). We went out a couple of weeks ago, and it was good. For the most part, conversation was light and was more getting-to-know-you stuff. Close to the end, he started to open up emotionally in terms of where he possibly saw things going for us. I honestly felt extremely anxious, had to force any words to come out of myself. I did say I needed things to be taken slow on all fronts, which he said was fine by him. 

On my way home, my feelings were honestly all over the place; on one hand, I did want to see where things went with him as he expressed, but on the other hand, this familiar pit in my stomach wouldn’t go away. I know that pit all too well, and I told myself that it was just anxiety and that this would blow over and it’d be fine. I mean, this is low-stakes since we are still getting to know each other, right? 

We have gone out a couple more times since. Jamie has been really patient with me so far, checking in with where I’m at in terms of comfort and any issues I might have. For the most part, I’ve found myself just smiling and nodding. I like spending time with him, but the pit just keeps growing. I know that at this rate it might swallow me whole. But Jamie has been so sweet, and he’s been hurt in relationships before, I don’t want him to get swallowed up either. I want to break this cycle, but I don’t know how to do it. 

All of the online resources I find do recommend therapy, which I’ll see if I can access it, though it might not be feasible financially so it’s not even guaranteed I’ll be able to do it. But in the meantime, what do I say to Jamie? Should I tell him I need to take a step back from our relationship as a romantic one, instead having us just be friends? What would be the best course of action here?

\- She's definitely been bothered by everyone noticing she barely does anything without Ted tagging along. She drove to get breakfast AND pick up packages alone? I was shocked. 

\- She needs to stop shoving a camera in his face as soon as he rolls out of bed. Read the room girly. Same with the meals. At this point it's clear that this man has nothing to say except for ""it's good"". Watch her try to get more out of him with the coffee and there's an obvious cut in the footage before he replies to her, most likely after her giving him shit for not participating well enough. Him telling her to eat her burrito was strongly giving ""stop bothering me"". 

\- Her having to point out that Ted actually did thank her for the burritos makes me think he didn't and it must have bothered her. 

\- You cannot convince me she wasn't annoyed as hell that Ted started prepping the ingredients for the soap WITHOUT her filming. How dare he. I noticed it when he was trying to open the window as well. EVERYTHING MUST BE FILMED. 

\- Of course Ted knew more about making soap than our own DIY queen. I feel like maybe he did that with his ex?

Doesn't surprise me that any remains of it have been relegated to the storage unit. 

\- The big box labeled merlot made yet another guest appearance. I suspect that's intentional cause obviously she wouldn't be drinking while making soap so surely that couldn't possibly have been the case when it accidentally came into frame in the thanksgiving video. Take that reddit!!! 

\- She leaves Ted to do the stirring and when she returns to take her turn she claims that ""it's taking a long time!"". Yes girl, a whole 4 min has passed. She's just so damn inauthentic that you really can't believe a word she says. Same with the color of the soap - one minute she loves that the color is weak cause it'll look rustic and she definitely likes that, then the next it apparently looked dingy and she's dumping the pigment in there. She's just so obsessed with portraying everything as perfect. Can't say she's actually succeeding. 

\- I guarantee Ted was well aware of how long the soaps would take to cure. I feel like this whole thing of them making soaps to jointly give away as Christmas presents was just her way of framing the video to make it seem like they're both so invested in doing things as a team. Also ""WE just kept adding more and more green"" - nope, that was all you.

Also her lips have been looking different for a while now and it finally clicked - **she definitely got a lip flip**. Her upper lip is way bigger and is totally paralyzed. The way she went from drinking normally through a straw to having to stick it into the corner of her mouth is the biggest give-away. Nothing wrong with getting something done of course, I just think it's funny how she hasn't mentioned it at all when she usually shares every single thing she does.

Okay I'm done being crazy now.",23,1733718140.0,Lifepluscindy_snark,2,0.97,False

I am specifically looking to talk to people who currently over use Uber or their own cars to see if they’ll consider other modes of transport.

Ive been hanging out at coffee shops, introducing myself and getting emails to set up  meetings. However despite talking to more than 40 people, I’ve only gotten 2 conversations scheduled. 

How would you approach this customer discovery exercise? ",1,1733718019.0,startups,2,1.0,False

I felt like the shots had great body and were generally great.  I switched to a VST 20g basket and started dosing 20g.  The shots seem to lack the body they once had.  Not loving the flavors and not totally sure what to do with my grind.  With more coffee in the basket, I need to grind coarser to get a 2:1 extraction in 25-30 sec or so.

I’m still pretty new to espresso.  What’s the school of thought on these larger baskets?  Is there somewhere good that I can read up on it some more?
