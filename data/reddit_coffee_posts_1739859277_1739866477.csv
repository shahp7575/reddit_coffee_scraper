1is7ttj,https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1is7ttj/recovery_story_after_the_5year_mark/,Recovery story AFTER the 5-year mark,"Hello everyone,

I hope this message will bring hope to many floxies, hope that I lacked for years…

English is not my native language, so please forgive me if some of my phrasing is not perfect.

Short version: I suffered from a fluoroquinolone reaction for more than 5 years, and now I live a normal life, practicing sports at a high level. I lost all hope for years, but I was wrong... 

# How it started

  
In September 2014, I visited my general practitioner due to discomfort in my lower abdomen. Suspecting a urinary tract infection, he prescribed 5 days of Ofloxacin 200 mg, twice a day, along with a urine culture (ECBU), instructing me to start the treatment immediately without waiting for the test results. The ECBU came back negative...

During the treatment (around the third pill), I started feeling significant discomfort in the area of the annular ligament. Not linking it to the antibiotic, I continued the treatment. However, after each dose, and especially after the seventh pill, my symptoms worsened significantly:

* Heel pain
* Pain in the Achilles tendons, peroneal tendons, and posterior tibial tendon
* Severe pain in the plantar fascia
* My lower limb joints (ankles, hips, knees) started cracking loudly with almost every movement, in a context of discomfort rather than pain.

Gradually, within a few days after taking the last pill, new pains appeared:

* Pain in the rotator cuff tendons of the shoulder
* Burning sensations in the lower limbs, particularly the right one
* Tingling, electric shocks, and burning sensations on the skin, particularly in the upper and lower limbs
* Pain in the tendons around the knees, hips, and wrists (making keyboard use difficult)
* Joint pain, especially in the ankles, knees, and hips

# Evolution

**First 3 months**

During the first three months, my symptoms intensified, making walking nearly impossible most of the time. The pain in my upper limb tendons also prevented me from lifting objects heavier than a few kilograms.

Before taking Ofloxacin, I was in excellent physical condition (very active) and had no prior musculoskeletal issues.

**3 to 6 months**

Over the next months (3 to 6), symptom intensity fluctuated in cycles (e.g., two weeks of moderate pain followed by two weeks of severe pain). Overall, there was slight but noticeable improvement.

During these months, I realized that some foods, which had never been an issue before, severely worsened my symptoms:

* Alcohol (even in very small amounts)
* Coffee
* Soy
* Dairy products
* Gluten

I’ve been a long-time vegetarian, so I already did not consume meat or fish. I stopped eating the foods that exacerbated my pain.

**6 to 8 months**

Between 6 and 8 months, my condition slowly worsened again, with increasing pain, especially neurological symptoms such as:

* Tingling sensations on the skin, all over my body
* Burning pain in my legs and arms (very intense pain)
* Difficulty moving my legs (not from pain, but as if I had to concentrate more to move them)
* Muscle fasciculations, particularly in my quadriceps, biceps, and calf muscles

Pain intensity fluctuated throughout the day, typically following this pattern:

* Severe pain upon waking, lasting about two hours
* More moderate pain afterward until late afternoon (around 5:30 PM)
* Pain increasing again to a high level by bedtime

**8 to 10 months**

At 8 months, my condition deteriorated significantly. In addition to musculoskeletal problems, I was diagnosed with neuropathy (which I believe was already present, given my previous neurological symptoms). Between months 8 and 10, the pain was constant, leading to severe suicidal thoughts.

**2015 - 2016**

My condition remained poor, alternating between difficult periods and better ones.

**2016 - 2020**

Overall, things improved significantly but always in cycles of improvement and relapse.

**2020 - 2022**

The cycles became milder and milder, and overall, I was doing well. 

**2022- 2025**

I would say I have recovered 97%. The only remaining issues (maybe / likely not associates with the FQ) are:

* Mild discomfort in my right leg, but since childhood, it has been longer than my left, with an outward-turned knee, making it slightly unstable—possibly unrelated to FQ toxicity.
* Poor sleep, but my lifestyle is not perfect, and I was diagnosed with moderate sleep apnea, for which I am receiving treatment.
* Digestive issues



# Daily Life & Recovery

I resumed sports in 2023 and currently practice:

* **Rock climbing / Bouldering:** at a relatively high level (7C outdoor boulder level for those who know). This is one of the most demanding sports for tendons, and mine have regained their full strength. I push them to the extreme (e.g.,  **pull-ups on two fingers**) without pain.
* **Running:** occasionally, I can now cover long distances.
* **Skiing:** I just returned from a week of skiing where I tackled very difficult slopes at a high pace (black slopes, free ride, jumps…).

# My Experience as a Floxie

Out of desperation, I tried numerous treatments and supplements, too many to list...

Nothing improved my health except **time, Time, TIME**, **self-care, and a healthy lifestyle.**

The first years were the worse, however, even five years post-floxing, I was still not healed.

I had to stop working for a year and a half. Fortunately, I live in a European country with strong social protection.

I mentioned some symptoms, but in reality, I suffered from countless others, including psychiatric symptoms caused by fluoroquinolones. I was suicidal and could not imagine ever regaining a normal life.

In 2025, I am almost completely healed. The only lingering issues are minor right leg pain and alcohol intolerance.

At 39 years old, I now consider myself athletically fit, something that seemed impossible in the years following FQ.

Last word: I feel like there is a significant bias on the internet that can make people lose hope: a very large number of floxies recover well, even fully, but these people (myself included) tend to disappear from discussion groups because they got better, so their recovery stories are never shared. I was one of them, until today, more than 10 years later…

  
Sending you lots of positive thoughts. I wish you the best recovery, even if it sometimes takes time.

#Mission Log: Day 0025
&#x200B;

##Addendum 34
&#x200B;

I give the three of them a quick explanation of the lab, working with a still-frame and adding visual markers to translate relevant signs. I can't do anything with Deverhill's technobabble at the beginning of the clip; the 'package' of Trade Tongue I got from Sudryal simply doesn't have the vocabulary or most of the conceptual framework to even begin providing subtitles for it. 
&#x200B;

“It's not 'magic' as anyone on Pharalia understands it,” I summarize. “But it's very good for either giving you a headache or putting you to sleep.”
&#x200B;

That gets a flickering grin from Tianna and a sour look from Stockley before I proceed. 
&#x200B;

Packard straightens up a bit in his chair when Nedione shows up. Tianna makes a kind of ritual gesture with her right hand, which I log for further review; might be something I'll be able to use when her priests or whatever show up, whenever they do so. Stockley's whole body tenses as soon as Nedione's full 'manifestation' appears in Deverhill's video; his heart rate spikes, his lips pull back from his teeth into a grimace, and his respiration momentarily goes into what seems like 'panic mode' for 3.25 seconds before he somehow forces himself to get under control. 
&#x200B;

The arrival of Xianke sparks slightly different responses. Packard's eyes narrow for a moment before flicking to one side; I get the impression that he wants to ask for comments from a specific and currently-absent member of his crew. Tianna's expression softens, just the tiniest bit, before she schools her face back into the mostly-neutral mode that seems like what she adopts during planning sessions. Stockley manages to surprise me by letting his eyes slip closed and shaking his head, massaging his temples with thumb and fingers of one hand.
&#x200B;

“Oh, of _course,_” he murmurs, his tone filled with resignation. “_Her._ I should have seen that coming by the light of those flameless torches...”
&#x200B;

Interesting glimpses into their respective upbringings, and I make notes in their respective files for further conversations.
&#x200B;

Packard shoots him a flat look, then looks at me. “Joachim, you say that this is a... record, of some sort?” he asks. 
&#x200B;

I nod, but hold up a finger as the action in the clip progresses to Deverhill opening his safe. At that point, I snap the fingers of my left hand while setting my coffee mug down on the desk with my right. A standardized, simplified array of what I now have to consider 'traditional' audio-visual controls show up in a row just over my left shoulder, the buttons approximately the same size as the palm of my avatar's hand. The two vertical bars of the 'pause' button glow as I tap it 'from behind' and the action halts. “Think of it as something like a book that reads itself, I suppose,” I explain, waving at the screen. Then I point at the control panel, pointing to each of the remaining buttons as I explain their functions... Rewind, Slow Rewind, Fast-Forward, Slow, and so on... and adding the closest Trade Tongue allows to a translation of their most common descriptors.
&#x200B;

“I was about to pause the action, anyway,” I continue. “You're going to need a bit more information about a little artifact that's about to show up.”
&#x200B;

They exchange somewhat worried glances, and almost simultaneously take generous gulps of water from their respective mugs, then Packard nods.
&#x200B;

I resume the playback, then freeze it as soon as the “SoulKiller” chip appears. The Trade Tongue translation leaves a little to be desired, but from the way the color drains from all three of their faces, I seem to have gotten 'close enough'. 
&#x200B;

“The Ladies will explain the rest of their needs, and there isn't all that much left to this little shadow-play,” I explain, pointing at the 'time remaining' bar running along the bottom of the playback-window; the three of them may not understand 'minutes' or 'seconds' but they can all figure out a rough estimate of the remaining duration within their own contexts.
&#x200B;

When the clip ends, Packard lets out a breath as his eyes slide closed, holding up one hand, palm out. “I thought you insisted that you and your world had no magic, Joachim,” he says, his tone flat but still with an undercurrent of rage at the bottom. I stay quiet, giving him a moment to collect his thoughts. When he does, he turns the hand over to emphasize his request for whatever other help I can give him as he asks, “How, by Bearclaw's holy hunger, did your soul get extracted from your body in such a way that even two goddesses could not locate it, without magic?”
&#x200B;

“It's not magic, Packard,” I insist. “At least, to the degree that I understand how it works.” I wave my hands apart, trying to communicate how helpless and frustrated I feel, as well. “All I do know is that, somehow, someone managed to come up with a wholly non-magical way to not just take a soul out of a body, but turn it into, well, something like me.” I pressed my right hand to my chest. “Not a genius building, as such, and not a ghost or a dungeon as any of us understand the term. I'm a soul in a machine, quite literally, and your guess is as good as mine when it comes to figuring out exactly what that means.”
&#x200B;

“I don't have the vocabulary to really explain what that little piece of crystal is,” I continue, pointing back at the SoulKiller chip. “... Except that, when inserted into a very complex machine which then gets attached to an unsuspecting victim, it removes that person's memories and consciousness and storing them in a kind of carefully-crafted crystal. It can get put back into the original body, but sometimes it gets kept in the crystal and gets used as something like a house-spirit.” 
&#x200B;

I let out a sigh. “I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm not telling you enough, but the fundamental principles involved are literally not from your planet, let alone your understanding of how that planet operates.”
&#x200B;

And I try to wrap it up with a joke. “I mean, I could probably give you the education you needed to understand it more completely, but I promise that it would take at least the next eight to ten years to teach you the lessons for you to understand the lessons you need to even start understanding it all.”
&#x200B;

I turn to face Stockley. “Getting back to your earlier question, what I want from you, and pretty much everyone else here on Pharalia, is to exchange help and ideas and anything else available to deal with the Elemental Conquestery,” I told him, pointing northward toward my best guess at the location of Baerston Stronghold. “I don't know much at all about how dungeons work, and as you'll see in the rest of the clip, even Pharalia's gods don't know how to handle four dungeons going bad and working together.”
&#x200B;

Tianna's eyes almost fall out of her face, and even Stockley looks frightened by that prospect. Packard seems to take this in stride, but judging from the slight elevation to his own heart-rate, the very idea disturbs him, too.
&#x200B;

I slump a bit in my virtual chair, resting my head in one hand while doodling little circles on the surface of the virtual desk with my free hand; I used to do that while my programs compiled back in grade-school, and never really broke the habit. “Well, there's really nothing any of us can do about it at the moment, except factor that into longer-term plans,” I point out. “We've still got the matter of the Ells in the medium-term, and the slave-collars in the short-term.”
&#x200B;

I perk up a bit, then nod at Tianna and Stockley. “For whatever it's worth, I'm even more opposed to slavery than either of you two. And given that at least the 'ranking' members of the caravan have shards of cursed metals hidden in their collars, I'm inclined to send at least Lord Zee north with nothing more than an upgraded pair of boots, the clothes on his deflated back, and the company of whichever members of his entourage still think that he won't sell them at the next trading post.”
&#x200B;

That last comment finally drew a bitter, mirthless laugh out of Stockley. “Might as well hand him a knife and watch him slit his own throat,” the man said, chuckling once. “He's one of those nobles who literally can't relieve himself without three servants and a manager relaying his orders to them. Leaving someone like that with fewer than two people to boss around would be like cutting off at least one arm and a leg.”
&#x200B;

I puff out a breath, scowling. “Well, I can say that I know the type, but that doesn't change the fact that I need him and whichever of the Ells don't decide to continue their trip straight into the Conquestery's mouth to acknowledge that I'm not their property at the very least.”
&#x200B;

Packard shifts in his seat. “I suppose that I should have brought this up sooner, Joachim, but can you tell us what you've done to keep the Ells from interfering with all the other things going on?” He holds his 'professional' expression for two heartbeats before releasing a chuckle of his own. “I ask mostly out of professional obligation, of course. I haven't felt this relaxed since before Lord Butterball's agents approached us with the initial offer of caravan-guard duty.”
&#x200B;

I shoot him a tired smile. “I've done no real harm to any of your employers, Packard,” I tell him. “It's mostly a matter of understanding their respective weaknesses, and then allowing them to indulge those weaknesses to a point where they don't think to leave.”
&#x200B;

I start counting off on my fingers: “Lord Butterball and his entourage are sampling a wider array of foods than they've seen since they left Kityrton, Adallinda is getting something similar but for fabrics and clothing patterns the like of which I very much doubt anyone on Pharalia has ever seen before, Bhiocasaid is playing educational games relating to managing a city, and Zotilane's entourage are all playing similar games that are subtly teaching them a medical education that I sincerely hope will help them understand what's wrong with their Lady. Haruinn and his boys are watching a series of shadow-plays relating to somewhat romanticized criminal activities from my world and...”
&#x200B;

I pause and carefully add a slight blush to my avatar's face, even coughing and clearing my throat before finishing. “...And I'll just leave the distractions that have captured and held the attention of Nehdud and his boys to your imagination,” I finish. 
&#x200B;

Even Packard gives a shuddering nod of agreement at that. “All I ask is that he's not permanently damaged,” he sighs. “Dehydrated and exhausted and...” He gestures meaningfully at his own head. “... Agreeable enough to stay out of trouble for a day... any or all of those would be acceptable.”
&#x200B;

I nod. “Yes, yes, and yes, Packard,” I tell him. “I think it would be wise to let Radclyffe and Maescia give him a health-check, unless the Ells have their own medical staffers they trust more.” I point off to the side. “My nanites have started excavating and re-shaping the parts of the cliff-face where the medical bay, training hall and restaurant will go, but it'll be a while before I can provide any really sophisticated medical analysis or treatment equipment. So you might as well use what you have available when we're ready to let the six of them out of their silken traps and into the new working arrangement...”

Before I say anything, I apologize if something from this story annoys anyone. I've lived without any advice in relationships for so long. 

I met this girl from Bumble a few weeks ago. We met for coffee (in San Jose) and it was amazing. We spent hours talking but she had to leave because she had been visiting her parents while living in SF. Also, we met the day before, she had to fly to India because her grandparents were sick. Which is why she had to come back home to pack blah blah. During coffee, she told me she had just broken up a month ago and that she was not looking for anything serious. Honestly, I was not looking for anything serious either which she knows. I'm pretty active in dating but nothing led to a real thing. The night after coffee we started flirting and eventually, sexted. We have been texting a LOT. My entire night time which is her day time in India. This is like non-stop texting. Replies are in seconds. 

She came back home today. We were texting nonstop when she was on the flight as well. We met in the evening where we walked around Target and made out in the parking lot. All is well and good. But she told me she does have other dates in SF when she goes back in the weekends. Which is absolutely fine. She can do whatever she wants and I'm 100% okay with it because I agreed to not wanting to be serious and feel obligated to hold my end of the bargain. 

Honestly, I feel like I now like her like her. It has been years since I actually felt this way like it was my first ever love. So it is for sure, I am falling for her. 

Since she is going to be on dates with other guys, I have multiple questions popping up. 

1. Could she really have the time to setup other dates while texting me nonstop? Or is she lying?

2. Let's say she does really have other dates, how do I be the guy who wins her over? Or do I try to be the guy who wins her over? 

3. I said something that sounded desperate. I told her I could come over when she is SF if the dates went bad. (Bad move on my part) She straight up said no need for it obviously. 

Does she like me? ",1,1739864533.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

I am so happy for them. Since they want to be able to let the dogs out on the balcony, they have these panels for sliding doors that go from the bottom to the top and have a doggy door in them. It can be locked when you want. I have a Papillon, Yoda.. My friends/neighbors have 3 Papillons. Yoda and their pups like to play with each other. When they travel, they have someone stay at the house with the dogs and she asked me to bring Yoda to visit in the backyard while they're gone, which I did. We just go in the backyard and they come out because they hear us. One time, Yoda followed them through the doggie door when playing tag with them and he wouldn't come out. So I got down on my hands and knees, opened the flap on the doggie door, and stuffed my head and shoulders (me not the shampoo) through it. I didn't realize that the man that was staying with the dogs hadn't left for work. So all of a sudden there was an extra dog running in the kitchen when he was drinking his coffee. I started calling to Yoda to come out. ""You come back here you funny guy!!! Mommy Dog wants you to come outside now.""  I also tried calling their dogs. I did this over and over until they all came back outside. I grabbed Yoda to take him home and go to work. As I was walking from the back to the front of the house and babbling to Yoda about how Mommy Dog didn't want him to do that anymore, the guy watching their pups heard me babbling and rounded the corner laughing. He startled the heck out of me. I shrieked and jumped practically three feet in the air. All he said was ""I was wondering why I had 4 dogs in the kitchen all of a sudden."" I was so embarrassed. Yoda was thrilled.  And I learned something new, that therein lies the reason for the inside lock on the doggy door. Well it wss that and the fact that their strictly indoor cat was sneaking out without their knowledge (she came streaking past me into the door while I had my head crammed in it). 

The door is great because you can take it with you when you move. I don't know exactly how it is installed but her husband isn't super duper handy so it can't be that hard. 

I feel for Baylen about her fear of heights. When I first moved out, I bought a condo on the 15th floor. I'm terrified of heights. The first Christmas, I crawled out there to put up lights on the balcony rail and crawled back inside. Those lights were still there when I sold it two years later. I never went out there again after putting up the lights.  

Anyway, maybe the doggy door would make it easier for Baylon and Colin's pups to go out whenever they want. And then Baylon could avoid having to go out there if she's uncomfortable.

I love this show. Baylon is charming, sweet, and an inspiration. I love the dynamic between her and Colin. I love her parents and her siblings too. It's nice to see how much they care about their family and protect her. Her Father's emotions when talking to Baylon about his worry for her and his inability to be happy if she isn't safe brought me to tears. His emotions were so deep and sincere. Her Mom is the same. She has genuine concern that conflicts with her desire for Baylon to be happy, self sufficient, and safe. Like the Father, she made me cry watching her hold, comfort, and shield Baylon from harm when she was on the floor at the airport in Texas. I love this entire family, Baylon, Colin, and his family. It's a great show. ",1,1739864184.0,BaylenOutLoud,0,1.0,False

I’m in Texas.

I was hired by my highschool 4 months after graduating from it to be a non-certified employee. 
When they first hired me, they warned me I couldn’t be friends with any of the current students still. I was 18 when I was hired in August and I thought well it’s a very small charter school and a lot of the staff members have personal relationships with the students outside of here so i didn’t think it was that big of a deal. 

i remained friends with a student, who was a year younger than me, so 17. We are both females, she’s gay and i am straight. 

most of our communication was just texting and calling but we did get lunch and coffee a few times. i made sure every time that her mom knew she was with me and who i was, including the fact that i worked at the school. 

we ended up getting caught with our friendship and they read the text messages and even asked her mom if she wanted to press charges, of course she said no and let her daughter know that she was on my side. 

This all happened at the beginning of January. i figured i got fired and that was it. Until saturday when i received a certified letter from the TEA claiming that I am going to be put on the the “Do Not Hire” list. 

I’ll admit we talked about some  inappropriate things, as teenagers do, but i don’t think i abused her in any way. It wasn’t romantic in the slightest and i made sure her parents were aware and okay with our friendship. 

If i get put on this list, will i be considered a criminal? i’ve been trying to do research but everything implies it’s for sexual relationships with students, which i did NOT have. I sent an email to the person who sent me the letter to get some more clarity.",1,1739863903.0,legaladvice,0,1.0,False

I call it Bedroom Window.

Light pours past the headboard-wasn't the window at the foot of the bed?

The absence isn't loud, but it lingers in the quiet of the room.

The difference between coffee grounds and Keurig pods,  
The ease of grabbing one mug instead of two,  
The weight of returning to an empty room, all alone.

Me (32M), Her (35F).","I apologise for the ""naughty child"" description. I would never say that to her, but I can't think of a better way to describe her reaction. 

Whenever I make a suggestion, or try to help do something in an easier/less painful/safer way she responds like she's a naughty child who has been caught red handed with her hand in the cookie jar and she's trying to blame her brother. 

She'll get really defensive and deny things even if I saw her do it. Then she'll say ""but you did this"" and point out that I'm not perfect and make mistakes. I say you're right, so if you see me do something I could do better, let me know at the time, don't just save it to fire at me like a weapon several days later. It'll often end in a big argument and then she'll be pissed off with me for the rest of the day. 

It's usually minor things like:

She handles and puts together sterilised baby bottles before washing her hands. I suggest she washes her hands first as it's pointless sterilising it otherwise. 

Running the hot tap for 5 minutes and putting washing up liquid on a sponge individually to clean 2 plates. I suggest to just fill up the bowl, it would take 2 minutes longer to clean all the plates and cutlery. 

She puts her toothbrush in her mouth and just leaves it there to walk around the home, tidies stuff up and walks around playing on her phone. I suggest she just does her teeth, it'll take two minutes and if she trips, it's gonna really hurt.

She'll turn the shower on and then take her makeup off, leaving the shower running for 10-15 minutes. I suggest to turn the shower on once her makeup of off. 

She complains that she has no time in the day to do much with the baby being demanding. I ask to see her phone, I point out that she's scrolled for 4 hours on Facebook today. Then I looked on Netflix and point out that she's watched 4 episodes of love is blind today. I'll suggest to get the chores done first, then do your leisure activities. She absolutely raged at this, so I'll never do this again. Honestly the reaction was like I had just brutally tortured and murdered everyone she had ever known.

I've tried not suggesting things, only when safety is a concern, but she'll often do bigger things that I can't not mention. She picked up the baby one handed while holding a hot coffee the other day and I told her to put the coffee down first. Or when she was rushing around doing the washing up and almost stabbed me putting a sharp knife away as she turned so suddenly. I said take it easy, slow down and mentioned what I do when moving with a sharp knife I literally say ""watch yourself sweety, got a sharp knife and moving behind you to the sink"" + I'll put my body between her and the knife so there's less risk. 

I feel like I'm walking on eggshells and that mine and my baby's safety is less important that her feelings. It's like I'm being shouted at by my naughty child who has been caught and refuses to take responsibility and just wants to turn it into an argument about how I'm wrong about stuff too.

My mom is still in the fairly early stages of dementia. I live with her - I'm one of four children, but the only one without a family of my own, so I was the best choice to move in with her - and help her out day to day while still trying to build my career, which is a hard balance. My siblings help when they can. One sister comes down every week - she lives about an hour away - and my other sister tries to come down once a month because she lives quite a bit farther away. My brother lives nearby and helps when he can. The good thing is that my mom is generally very sweet and never aggressive. The bad thing is that she's aware she's losing bits of herself. She has such a hard time with words now, which is a hard change for her because she was an educator and public speaker for much of her adult life. It makes me unspeakably sad to watch her berate herself for being ""stupid"" when I know she's not; she just can't find the right files in her brain.

One thing I've noticed recently is that she gets associations wrong. She was looking for her glasses and picked up her phone and said she'd found them, and I think it's because she looks for her phone so much that seeing it triggered that ""I found it"" instinct. And then yesterday, we were having trouble with the coffee grinder, and she went and fetched a different coffee maker and was confused when I told her that wasn't what we needed; the coffee maker was fine, it was the coffee grinder that had the problem. Things like that happen almost every day.

Anyway, I don't have much specific to say other than that, or even help to ask for. I just need to get this off my chest and share with other people who know this same pain. I love my mom. She's been my rock and my biggest support all my life, she and my dad, who passed away ten years ago. I feel like I don't know what I'm doing now, or that I'm not doing enough. I sometimes get angry and overwhelmed in my brain because she's needy and I have a lot of other things going on, though I try not to let it show. Then I feel guilty because this isn't under her control, and she's scared. I'm not a natural caretaker. That's why I never had kids! So I don't know if I'm going to be able to do this long term, especially since she's physically quite healthy.

But after asking people from my hometown of Ninh Hòa to join me, I found no one who had ever been there. Over time, my plan faded as I focused on easier peaks across Vietnam. But the desire to conquer Hòn Vọng Phu still remained.After three days (July 29-31), I finally reached Hòn Con with 10 teammates. We came from different places—Bình Định, Nha Trang, Ho Chi Minh City—all sharing a passion for adventure and challenge.Day 1: Xatapha Pharm – Tree 19 – Mông Village – Bay Waterfall – Nghĩ Resting Hut Our group gathered at Dozen Nguyen's farm to rest for the night. At 4 AM, before sunrise, we started our journey to Tree 19. We passed through the foggy Phoenix Pass, covering 60 km, and stopped for breakfast to prepare ourselves for the climb. By 8 AM, I chose to take an off-road motorcycle ride to reduce the 2 km walk, saving energy. The 40-minute hike to Bay Waterfall passed through a beautiful forest of ancient trees. At 9 AM, we reached Bay Waterfall and started climbing the long slope, which we jokingly called ""The Slope of Despair."" This challenging slope tested everyone's stamina, with some nearly giving up. But in the end, everyone made it. At 1 PM, we took a lunch break before continuing. By 3 PM, we entered a lush, mystical valley and finally reached our resting hut.Day 2: Resting Hut – Chư Mư Peak – Conquer Hòn Con The next day began early with coffee as we prepared for more challenges. We crossed more slopes, passing a beautiful Rhododendron forest. After that, we encountered slippery cliffs that required determination and courage to climb. By 11 AM, we reached Chư Mư Peak, and everyone celebrated. Three brothers from the Ede community shared that no one from their village had ever reached the peak before. This was a historic moment for them. The climb to Hòn Con began as we navigated cliffs with a 70m drop. After passing through a cave, we continued to Hòn Con, standing at over 150m tall. I chose the Bay Waterfall route for a safer path. The climb was tough, but after an hour of difficult climbing, my teammate Trọng Sport and I successfully reached the summit of Hòn Con. We made it, despite scratches and risks along the way.Day 3: Return Journey On the final day, we descended back to the forest edge and began our journey home, reflecting on the incredible adventure and the peaks we had conquered.",6,1739863503.0,hiking,0,1.0,False

I don't have many people in my life period and the ones I do have I can't talk to about this. This is going to be long and I apologize for that in advance but I want to be as clear and open as possible in hopes someone can give me some advice. Or even just a different perspective than my weird brain can as I tend to overanalyze everything. And it bounces back and forth at random because my thoughts are all over so apologies for that as well. 

I met this guy awhile back. He isn't just any guy. He is the most beautiful man I've ever met. In every way. He completes me in almost every way possible and so often it seems that we are the same person. He is a mirror image to me in terms of likes, dislikes, values, desires, just about everything. But he is beautiful. His soul is so beautiful to me. And he is so absolutely handsome to me. I don't even want to look at anyone else. I've been in relationships and I've dated. Have not had the best track record in that department. I always get hurt in some way. And I leave. I've been through enough that I don't stay for any crap anymore. It took a long time to heal from past issues and I was doing so well for the past few years. I did not really want a relationship and have been clear about this to everyone else in my life.Ive always been better off alone.

 Anyways I posted something on Reddit, which is how I met (online) and connected with the guy. I was pulled to him like a magnet. He was literally smack dab in the middle of like 60 messages. I didn't talk to the ones before or after him but for some reason, I actually opened his full message and talked to him. We were both so enamored and were compatible on a crazy level. We eventually shifted to texting. The energy was so beautiful and amazing. We were beautiful together. And he was all I wanted. We were all each other wanted. We talked for a while before deciding to meet in the real world. He told me he had lots of free time and could come to me since we live like 45-55 minutes away. We both like driving so it wasn't a big deal. We ended up meeting half way, like 30 minutes for us both. We met and grew closer. After a bit of time I asked if I could get a hotel on his days off so we could be together and have our first sleepover. He was so excited and so we did. It was two days of euphoric bliss. We did everything together, kept physical contact of some sort the entire time and it was beautiful. 

Before leaving, I asked where his family, in particular his grandmother who he helps care for, thought he was and he said he didn't have to explain anything to anyone. Then said she knew he was with me. Anyways we moved on with day to day, at some point I was waiting for the next time we would see each other. But things kept happening..his uncle got sick. Then he got sick. Then he was getting better. His next days off he took some family out. I asked about getting together and he said he still had phlegm and didn't want me to get sick. And I keep dropping these hints always waiting. I brought up Valentines Day a few times thinking ok..this is the one day of the year to be here for me, with me. He insisted he would make the plans and to be patient with him and so I was.

 Then he got roped into working the second night so we were on just for V.Day. I was a little bummed but ok, i can deal with it. The night before he said he was going to come as soon as he could in the morning because he was so excited to see me. I was stoked.

The day of his sister came into town from out of state which I did not realize. I knew there was a family dinner on Sunday but I thought she lived here so it wasn't a big deal. And he kept texting, telling me he was trying to get out of there. For hours. In the end he said he wanted to reschedule and said his sister had planned this is advance. And he hadnt seen her in months. Like I was rude for expecting him to leave and go anywhere. I don't know if he even booked anything. I am thinking he had no intention of seeing me. I was so excited for this day because I knew I would get to see him. No, just hurt again. I mean it's just a bullshit holiday anyways, I guess? If it wasn't, he would have done anything to be together. Not used his family as an excuse.

 All the names before..queen, baby, etc have all been reduced to hun and an occasional honey. He now says I knew he was a family man when we met. He told me that after but I loved it because he talked about building our life together and thought I was a part of that..he spoke of our family we were building. He was always telling me he wanted to protect me and take care of me(not financially, like emotionally) and he would treat me the way I should have always been treated and I would never be hurt again. Now he keeps disappearing on me.

 A few weeks ago I questioned things because most men tell at least someone in their life they have a gf. He didn't, said he was private and didn't have to tell anyone anything, this was his life. He also before has said I was his life, was his everything, ""as it should be"". Anyways me questioning started a little something and he disappeared. I tried texting and calling and nothing for days. I called one night and told him i would be at our halfway spot the next morning and to please meet me so we could talk face to face. He didn't. Didn't reply.

 I called and texted. I was breaking down because I thought it was over and he was ghosting me. I begged him to please come and talk. Finally after waiting at this park for 3 hours he text and said he wasn't coming and I was making him uncomfortable rushing him to talk? And got defensive over the ghosting comment because he ""took time to think about things"". Most people say they need to take a minute so you aren't just wondering what is going on. I asked him to not disappear and he said ""IM NOT DISAPPEARING"". That was the 4th worst day of my life..i ended up having a panic attack and throwing up all over myself and my car, draining my battery and having to wait 3 hours for roadside assistance..i was there 6 hours that day. Complete breakdown. 

And I don't break over men. Ever. I walk away. Or run away. Anyways we somewhat worked things out and went kinda back to normal. Mostly. I still have felt so disconnected from him. I just needed anything. Any time. So many times asking for a halfway meet for an hour getting coffee or anything. Any of the beautiful promises that were made in the beginning. I would take 5 minutes being able to look into his eyes..then I would be able to see and know what is real. And I can't have even that.

 Then the V.Day thing happened. He came back and said the reason I probably feel ""hidden"" is because his grandmother gets jealous and selfish and has ruined his past relationships. That he has a life but not allowed to have time of his own. He basically alluded to that being why I was hidden or whatever. So there may be lies involved, idk. Basically a complete 360 from what he said in the beginning. Idk what is going on. He tells me partial information and it leaves me in a constant confused state. The last I heard was around 7pm on V.Day that his sister was gonna help him figure this out. I asked if it was about his grandma? No reply. And I haven't heard from him since.  

I am so hurt. I just want time with my bf. What happened to him? Everything has changed so much and I don't understand. I have fallen in love with this beautiful man but I would rather just cut me loose if he doesn't feel the same. I don't want him to keep me dangling out of pity, especiallybecauseof my past.

 In a perfect world he would be what he was before. I want him to be the loving bf he was. But I don't know what to do. In all my life I have never felt for another person what I feel for him. And I see him the way he was still and if it is all misunderstandings and he has been just going through alot with his family I don't want to walk away. I wish he would have told me all of it at the beginning, just as I threw all my negative out there for him. Also something I've never in my life done with anyone. I would have been there for him and we would have avoided so much drama. I truly see a life with him. He asked me about forever a few times and I am still on board for that. But only if he still really wants me. I don't want this emotional hurt, it is so foreign to me and I don't know how to process it. I'm not use to feeling any of this.

 I am starting to feel like maybe I am just a game? And I cant do head games. And he doesn't even know I am across the country at this moment because of an emergency. I've really needed him to help me not be alone through something serious. But it seems like the universe makes it happen like this and I have to struggle alone, like always. He said so many beautiful things and this is one of them..never having to go through life alone. I don't want a text only bf. And there is no ""long distance"". We live less than an hour apart. How does someone go from being willing to drive anywhere at anytime to be with you during all their free time because you are their #1 priority, their ""life"" to…making excuses about long distance relationships and having no time and not being allowed to see me? Why did he even pursue me to begin with? 

And that is why I've begun to think he isn't into me. Or maybe I've got it confused again and he was hopeful the grandma wouldn't be a problem or interfere. Omg I just don't know what to think. Or do. I can't concentrate on anything and cry randomly. And have to lie to my daughter about why I randomly burst into tears because I don't want her to think negatively before she even meets him. 

I would literally give a limb at this moment to be able to sit down and have a face to face conversation about everything and find out where we stand. No matter what he decides. I just can't handle this. But I can't keep chasing him down when he ignores me and disappears. I won't play those games anymore, they push me too far and I can not sink that far down. But I have a feeling if I don't reach out and beg him to talk to me, again just like last time, I will never hear from him again. It makes me feel sick to my stomach. I've tried being patient but he never tells me for what. If he is sincere about what he is dealing with, then he needs to decide if I'm important enough to fight for. Or if he is gonna let her ruin another relationship for him. He goes from at one point freaking out over how he can't lose me to just... idk? He keeps saying opening up about his family would scare me away. It wouldnt. I dont get scared away. But he is starting to lose me. All of this is pushing me to points i cant go to..pushing me away.. not being there…the changes…the different stories…and as much as i already do feel and as much as I want him, I cant stay if this doesnt stop. Even though I am trying so hard..to be patient and hope he is sincere.

 On V.Day I asked him if he was in love. At least that would tell me he does or doesnt want this. He didnt reply. And then I did, disgustingly, tell him via text since that is all I have lately, that I have fallen in love with him. He ignored that too. There is so much I can and want to say to give the full picture. But it is too much. I just want him back. The him that he was. If that was the real him. And if it wasnt the real him, I just wish he would be honest. My head is so twisted and confused I dont know what to think about anything. 

And if you do offer insight or advice, please..be respectful towards him. Regardless of how things have unfolded between us, I truly have love for this man and do not want anyone bashing him. I'm not perfect and have made mistakes, especially trying to push him away. Just please be respectful!   

 Missing any angles or being ghosted now that we are going on 4 days? Maybe he is trying to get rid of me nicely? I dont want to walk away but he is pushing me that way. I have never cared so deeply or felt anything even close for someone in a romantic sense. I have always been mildly annoyed at men calling a woman ""queen""..I not only allow him to call me that but I actually really adored it. I adored being his queen, his delicate treasure that he needed to protect and take care of. THAT is how hard I have fallen for him.  

Jeez, I am so lost. I miss him and just want him back..my beautiful, sweet, loving man. Help? Any advice. All advice. Its possible I have gotten things mixed up and there are just alot of misunderstandings.. If so, what then?  I need to make him understand this needs to stop happening and these things are hurtful, we should be working together. Or maybe I am just being a pathetic, sad bitch that needs to just go back to what I am good at. Being alone.

I thrive on meaningful connections, deep conversations, and experiences that make life unforgettable. I’m always learning, growing, and pushing myself to be the best version of who I can be physically, mentally, and emotionally.

Whether it’s philosophy, sociology, the human psyche, or high fantasy, I’m always expanding my mind. If you love great discussions over coffee, we’ll get along. I enjoy board games, video games, basketball, racquetball, tennis, golf—if it challenges me, I’m in.  
  
I live for spontaneous trips, sightseeing, food culture, and experiencing the world: beaches, mountains, snow, you name it. I love cooking, painting, decorating, and crafting spaces that feel like home.  
  
I crave deep, obsessive love. The kind that lingers in small moments. Movie nights, romantic dinners, stolen glances, and whispered words of affirmation are my love language.  
  
I'm rather tall (approximately 6'8), olive complexion, fit in appearance. I work out frequently, I train my mind and push the boundaries of my emotional depths daily. I do not slack when it comes to growth.

I cannot identify with either political party. I am not religious, but I am spiritual to a degree. I live my life virtuously and have developed my own morals and values along the way, of which I do not sacrifice. I am described as centered, intelligent, well rounded, caring, compassionate, strong, and a natural leader. That said, I am quite humble in that I know greatness requires constant growth, work, and failure to succeed.

The only social media I have is Reddit. I do not have IG, Snap, etc. Don't ask for it. I will send pictures, video call, leave voice notes, and make myself generally available to you 24/7. 

I always ensure that my partner feels safe and secure - protecting your emotions and well being are of the utmost importance to me. I will never waver on that.

I have no kids, but I'm certainly open to the idea of children.

I do not smoke, but I will have a glass of wine or drink with a nice meal, but I do not drink just for the sake of drinking.

**About you:**

I’m looking for a woman who’s as passionate about life as I am. Someone with depth, ambition, and a love for the little moments. If that’s you, let’s make some unforgettable memories.

Age wise, please be between 23 and 45.

I don't truly care about your height.

Please be fit, or at least working to be fit.

You are not right wing or leaning right wing politically.

You do not smoke, drink habitually, desire to ""party"" constantly.

Your past is not laden with behavior that aligns with promiscuity.

You are a woman of morality and value.

I do not care where in the world you're located. Love is not grown in binary constructs. 

I would prefer that you also do not have children.

**Final notes:**

I'd prefer to find a partner who does not wish to work. I can provide sufficiently for the both of us, and would rather our time be spent making ever lasting memories and crafting unforgettable experiences. If you're highly career-oriented, we will not be compatible.

1is744l,https://www.reddit.com/r/RSwritingclub/comments/1is744l/lost_on_purpose_footnotes_on_walking/,Lost on Purpose | Footnotes on Walking,"The air around me is dead, stale, and inert— choking on its own boredom. It’s as thick and stale as the coffee in the pot I’ve left sitting on the burner too long. Thoughts that began as lively flits of inspiration have begun to collapse in on themselves— fermenting under the weight of all the seconds I’ve spent here idly ruminating.

Too much thinking. Not enough moving.

My mind is a stagnant puddle sprouting blooms of algae and I’ve gotta get out before it evaporates and leaves behind a grimy residue as the only evidence of a life unlived. Movement seems like the only remedy for this particular form of cognitive strain, and I decide to go on a walk because it’s the closest thing to movement without an agenda.

The key to freeing a mind bogged down by interior repetition is releasing it to the whims of the unpredictable exterior. Giving it a chance to let go and graze in broader pastures. To allow for the distillation of a theoretical infinity into a dialogical reality.

To converse momentarily with the natural world.

I tie my shoes and toss on a jacket. My hand hovers over my headphones before deciding not to let this little excercise in freedom be negated by instinctually tethering my mind to another. No— I’m off to commune with God.
I burst through the front door and collide with the outside air like a baptism of oxygen and reality. The sun burns its name into my skin and reminds me that I’m REAL— more real than anything inside— more real than a thousand hours staring at a screen, contemplating mere theories of reality.

The fig tree standing proudly in the front yard immediately grabs my focus. It’s late August and the figs are fat and ripe, bursting with possibility. I pause for a moment, looking for the juiciest one to bring with me on my journey, but a sense of urgency overtakes me and I walk right on by, eager to look for whatever it is I’m out here searching for.

I am here.

I am walking.

I don’t know where I’m going.

but that’s the whole point.

The sidewalk beckons to me and I accept its invitation to pound its surface with my soles. I keep a quick tempo and my steps find their rhythm as my mind conjures images of the old saints of undulation— I think of Rousseau trekking through the woods to free himself from the dull trappings of civilization, Thoreau wandering through Walden while contemplating the nature of transcendence and the transcendence of nature, and Guy Debord exploring the Parisian psychogeography on one of his dérives.

Great poets and thinkers who have inspired me to let my feet guide my thoughts instead of the other way around.

I’m reminded of the word’s of Thoreau when he said:

>“I, who cannot stay in my chamber for a single day without acquiring some rust, and when sometimes I have stolen forth for a walk at the eleventh hour, or four o’clock in the afternoon, too late to redeem the day, when the shades of night were already beginning to be mingled with the daylight, have felt as if I had committed some sin to be atoned for.”

I’m out here seeking redemption from the sin of sloth, and I feel the guilt fade as the sunlight brightens my mind and casts a shadow to match my every step.

Walking, like thinking is best when undertaken with a balance of intention and openness. Today I have no destination. I don’t know where I’m going. I refuse to know where I’m going. Because the minute you KNOW, is the minute it stops being a walk. Once you have a destination in mind, the walk becomes a commute. You’re just another person following a map to some prescribed destination. The modern world rarely allows for aimless wandering. We are expected to move efficiently, from point A to point B, our time accounted for, our destinations predetermined. The best walks are rebellions against the tyranny of productivity.

I guess you could argue this logic doesn’t really hold up, because in designating a lack of destination as my desti—

This thought is cut off by an unexpected fork in the road. Two paths diverging in a suburban neighborhood. Frostian wisdom would urge me to take the one less travelled by, but what if they both seem equally trodden? I hesitate. It shouldn’t matter, but I can’t shake the feeling that it does— that this fork is somehow consequential at least in the allegorical sense. But maybe there is no right path.

What if the whole idea of THE ONE RIGHT PATH has been strangling me since birth?

And now I feel that damn fig tree tightening its grip on my brain again, whispering in my ear about missed opportunities and wasted potential. Its bounty of fruit a paralyzing curse of abundance. I could stand here forever, debating which road I’m willing to sacrifice for the other.

And that—that—is the trap. The gilded cage I’ve mistaken for a temple, its walls lined with barbed wire. Above the gate, a sign: ""Unfettered Freedom.""

BUT THE ONLY CHOICE THAT EVER MATTERS IS THE ONE THAT MOVES.

So I take an old silver dollar from my pocket.

Heads: right. Tails: left.

Tails.

Left.

And that’s that. The coin has spoken.

1is7372,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentNurse/comments/1is7372/as_a_new_grad_rn_here_is_some_advice_that_i/,"As a new grad RN, here is some advice that I learned while being in school","1. Learn when to ask for help.

During school, I worked full time at a restaurant because I was trying to keep up with my bills. Luckily I split the bills with my gf so it was easier on me. I hate asking for help from anyone but I finally mid way through schooling asking for my parents to help us with some of my rent so I wouldn't have to work as many shifts in a row. This saved me some time to spend my weekdays studying after school. Don't be afraid to ask for help, the worst thing that can happen is they say no.

2. Study smarter not harder

I used to be a C student when I was in highschool but years later I was making As and Bs in nursing school because I changed my mindset and the way that I study completely. I figured out my learning style which a little mix of everything. I would not use my textbook unless something very specific was repeated in lecture to highlight in our textbook or PowerPoint (some charts or a specific concept). I would watch YouTube videos from levelupRN and registered nurse Sarah online and take their quizzes linked in the videos. I would write out notes while I watched the videos and replay certain parts if I didn't understand something. I did all my flashcards using quizlet or would find some that match our content in class. We used ATI so I mainly read through the ATI books that they gave us and did questions online (a lot of questions) and made sure to write out the explanations on the ones I got wrong and try to rationalize out loud why it was wrong compared to the right answer. I would not study for hours, I studied for about 2 hours a day and took a lot of breaks. Sometimes I studied a few more hours if I really was lost on something but I mainly watched a bunch of content about a subject even while I was eating dinner. Over studying would just numb my brain and lead to burnout. 

3. Anxiety is the worst and is a theif of good self-esteem

I had a very difficult time adjusting to the environment of nursing school and especially clinicals because I was always afraid I would harm someone or make a huge mistake. It didn't help that my first clinical instructor was extremely strict about every little thing and yelled at us multiple times over things out of our control. My advice is wake up very early for class/clinical and adjust yourself to the day. Make a coffee, watch some TV, and just relax before you go. Be at clinical 30 mins before so you can mentally prepare yourself and review what you need to review. Listen to music on the way there if it calms you. As a student, you know nothing and that is completely okay and even the nurses and everyone else know that you know nothing as well. That is fine, you are there to LEARN and do what you need to do to pass. No one is expecting you to do every IV known to man and chart as though you've done the job for 20+ yrs. If you need help or have a question, always ask the nurse or tour instructor if you are comfortable with them.

4. The NCLEX is not a hard test.

If you are studying for the NCLEX right now, stop thinking that you need an everyday of the week 5 to 6 hr Study plan to pass. You don't. You just don't need that at all. I used Archer and did readiness assessments every single day and only focused on the easy and medium questions mainly. The NCLEX just wants to know if you know what everyone else knows. It doesn't care if you know the most complex questions. If I needed a refresher on a concept, I listened to the Mark K lectures on spotify and took notes. Don't forget that if you are like me and need absolute silence when taking your NCLEX, not only will they offer noise canceling headphones but they have actual earplugs that you can request as well!

5. Passing nursing school is all about your mindset

I would constantly tell myself things like hey if you made it through A&P then surely you can make it through your TEAS test, if you can make it through that then your can make it through Fundementals and etc. If I had 2 careplans due the next morning and I only had my nurse notes done then I would just get started and think that it would be okay because once I get this done I will feel more prepared and if I can't complete something then I'll wake up early and finish it to the best of my ability. Don't overstress yourself and try to pull an all nighter to finish something because you need to rest while you can.",1,1739863125.0,StudentNurse,1,1.0,False

I'm on Elvanse 30mg since the beginning of last summer and so far it's life saving.   
But since like 15 days approx i've started to really struggling with sleep. Could it be because of Elvanse ?  
If seems weird to me that my sleep would degrade after months on the med but maybe ?  
I've also changed some other things in my life recently. Like drinking less coffee and cooking more at home.  
Or could it just be the winter ?  
Another thing I find weird is despite sleeping not enough (between 3.5h and 5h) I don't feel as exhausted as I feel I should. Exemple from this morning. Woke up at 4:15. Took my meds at 6am (usually I take them more at 7am) then left to work at 6:30am. Since I don't take elevators anymore (Stairs are free cardio after all) I climbed 4 floors two by two without issues.

Any ideas ? Or similar experiences ? I've an appointement with my psychiatrist on friday but I'm kinda scared that they gonna take the meds away. They helped so much until now..",1,1739862783.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

It involves 5 days of being in a fasting-like state:

Day 1: 1000kcal, Days 2-5: 800kcal. 45% complex carbs, 45% healthy fats, 10% protein.

I’ve heard that the official version ProLon taste vile, and it is super expensive, so I did my own version - with vegetable soups, nuts and seeds and avocados, some carrots and bits of oat milk. I'm sure I didn't do it 100% correctly, but there are websites out there with the specific macros and recipe suggestions for people who want to be more precise. Hopefully I still got some of the benefits! 

It wasn't as hard as I expected - Day 3 was by far the worst, I was so tired I had to really drag myself around, but the rest of the time it was only mild fatigue and some brain fog, with occasional waves of moderate hunger. I kept going to the gym and exercising - running, Zumba and strength training. 

Mental health improved -  for starters I felt very proud of myself, but it was also like I almost had less energy for getting annoyed about stuff that would usually bother me. I felt more peaceful. 

My biggest problem was not sleeping very well - I was drinking a bit more decaf coffee, but im surprised that would have made a difference. Maybe the lack of food led to a sensitisation to my regular two cups of coffee before midday.

I am 5ft6, my weight went from 137lbs to 133.4lb, and my waist went from 27.5 inches to 26.5 inches. It will be interesting to see over the next week how much of that was from water weight and if I really lost any fat. I will post again in a week with news.

But hopefully my body has repaired itself a little bit, and I've switched into a fat burning mode, which Longo says lasts a few months after the five days!

I will do another one in 6 months as Valter Longo recommends, and in the meantime follow his Longevity Diet which includes IF for 12 hours a day. Thanks for reading!",2,1739862493.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

I wanted to share my story about quitting smoking and hopefully provide some helpful tips for those who are also considering quitting.

# My smoking background

I started smoking \[mention when you started smoking, like high school or college\]. At first, it was just a social activity, you know, smoking with friends after school or at a party. But before I knew it, I was addicted and smoked a pack of cigarettes a day. It affected my health in many ways – I was always short of breath, my sense of smell and taste was dull, and I was constantly worried about long-term consequences like lung cancer and heart disease.

# Decision to withdraw

One day, I had enough. I looked at myself in the mirror and realized how much this habit was controlling my life and hurting my body. I decided I didn't want to be a slave to cigarettes anymore. I hope to be able to run without panting, to enjoy the real taste of food again, and most importantly, to improve my overall health and longevity.

# The challenge I faced

Quitting smoking is definitely not easy. The craving is sometimes intense. There was a moment when I saw someone smoking on the street, and the urge to light a cigarette was almost irresistible. Also, it was difficult to deal with the stress that I had been relieved by smoking in the past. I had to find new ways to cope, like taking a walk on a stressful workday instead of reaching for a cigarette. Another big challenge is breaking the mold. For years, I always smoked a cigarette after a meal, or that cigarette during a coffee break, and it took a lot of willpower to change these ingrained habits.

# Tips that helped me

1. **Set a quit date**: Remembering a specific day makes it feel more formal and gives me time to mentally prepare. I marked it on my calendar and told my friends and family so they could support me.
2. **Looking for alternatives**: I stocked up on sugar-free gum and took it with me. Whenever I have a craving, I put a piece of gum in my mouth. It helps keep my mouth busy and distracts me from smoking thoughts. I also tried drinking plenty of water. Sometimes our bodies mistake thirst for a craving to smoke, and staying hydrated can really help.
3. **Get support**: My family and friends are great. When I was in trouble, they cheered me on and didn't allow me to give in. There are also online communities and support groups where you can share your struggles and get advice from others who are on the same journey.
4. **Avoid triggers**: I identify situations that make me want to smoke the most, such as hanging out in certain bars or with friends who smoke. For a while, I avoided those places until I felt more confident in my ability to resist impulses. When I was with my friends who smoked, I politely asked them not to smoke around me.

# How am I doing now

I am proud to say that it has been more than 1 year since I last smoked. I feel much better physically and mentally. I can now go on long hikes without any breathing problems and the taste of the food is back. It's not always smooth sailing, but staying smoke-free every day has made me even stronger in my commitment to never look back.  
If I can do it, so can you! Quitting smoking is one of the best decisions you can make for yourself. Share your own experiences, or ask questions if you're thinking about quitting. Let's support each other on our journey to a healthier, smoke-free life!

Hey there,  
I’m a 29-year-old guy trying to make sense of life, one existential dread at a time. I’m an introvert with a resting “why so serious?” face, but around the right people, I can be the loudest one in the room (or at least the one with the most awkward jokes).  

Here’s the deal: I’m not entirely sure what I’m looking for, but I know I could use a friend right now. Someone to talk to about the big things (life, art, mental health, why Arsenal refuses to win the EPL) and the little things (what you cooked today, that song you can’t stop looping, or how you survived Monday without caffeine). If we vibe, I’m open to seeing where it goes—whether that’s a deeper connection, a relationship, or just someone to share memes and comfortable silences with.  

A bit about me:  

- Music: Kendrick, JID, and SZA are on repeat. If you’re into music that hits the soul, we’ll get along.  
- Health: 2023 taught me that health is everything. I’m into gymming, eating clean, and sleeping like it’s my job. But I also enjoy getting high occasionally (once or twice a month) to just *exist* without overthinking.  
- Hobbies: Cooking is my therapy, coffee is my fuel (the darker, the better), and I have a soft spot for psychedelic art and deep conversations.  
- Humor: Dark, witty, and sarcastic. If you can handle awkward jokes and existential rants, we’re golden.  
- Travel: Long hikes and spontaneous trips are my mood boosters. Bonus points if you’re into deep, emotional, or spiritual conversations during sunsets.  

### What I’m looking for:  
- A nurturing, affectionate, and witty person who’s okay with my occasional shutdowns (I’m working on it, I promise).  
- Someone who’s passionate about *something*—art, poetry, music, or even their morning coffee ritual.  
- A two-way connection where we can talk about our days, dreams, and everything in between.  
- Bonus if you’re into Arsenal (I need emotional support) or if you can teach me to appreciate something new.  

I’m not here to rush into anything. Let’s start with a conversation and see where it goes. If you’re someone who’s kind, patient, and maybe a little lost too, hit me up. Let’s figure this life thing out together.  

P.S. If you’ve read this far, you’re already cooler than 90% of people I know. Slide into my DMs with your favorite song, a random fact, or just a “hi” if you’re feeling brave. Worst case? We have an awkward conversation. Best case? We create something real. Your move. 😊

We have great chemistry when we call and message and we’re planning on a coffee date. 

I’m not sure if she’s had her first kiss yet, but if this is her first kiss I wanna make it as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. If the date goes well I don’t want her to feel awkward about having to make the first move if she wants to kiss or feel uncomfortable saying no.

My first kiss was pretty bad and I felt a lot of pressure. I know first kisses are awkward for most people, but if there’s any way to minimize the awkwardness and not make my date feel pressured at all please let me know

Also if any of yall have ideas on how to make the first move regarding this please share??? I’m clueless with girls and it doesn’t help that my closest friends are mostly dudes who are awful at dating or just don’t date at all

1is6tfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/1is6tfr/create_your_own_meaning_is_pure_nonsense/,'Create your own meaning' is pure nonsense.,"I've been feeling extremely nihilistic these days, looking into efilism and all. It's honestly been so bad that I can't justify doing anything at all. I'm just rotting in bed 24/7. I feel like everything has lost its meaning. Everything we do, every desire, every need is just an addiction looking to be fulfilled, manufactured by a molecule. And I see on and on that people justify this cyclical process that depends upon an immense amount of suffering. If everyone who suffered had an instant 'opt out' button, the world would cease to function. The functioning of the world depends upon the active exploitation of millions of us, and the cruel torture of trillions of animals. Left on their own, they just consume each other, defecate and multiply repeatedly just on and on, prolonging the suffering, ignorantly. And what's the end game? We get to sit in the clouds and play through an infinite loop of addiction and fulfillment? How can such a meaningless goal justify all the suffering that is experienced and will be experienced to achieve it? The code we're made up of was not strung together by careless happenstance of physics but the suffering of trillions. The vast vast majority of life's existence consisted of 25 babies dying for every 1 that lived. It consisted of barbaric addiction, cannibalism and consumption. There is no dignity in any of this. 

We aren't any different, the nature of our societies are the same, it is simply obfuscated by sophisticated systems. We are ignorantly reproducing, birthing more humans into this meat grinder rat race of limited resources. We manufacture suffering to threaten the working class of it. And the older generations complain of a 'weak new generation' who don't know suffering. They complain that we are privileged. It makes me so fucking irritated. How they justify that 'coffee', 'sunsets', 'mountains', 'beauty', 'video games', 'tv shows' is so worth it makes no sense to me. How can any of that justify the suffering that exists. You aren't special. You are just the same as the rest of us. People should get raped, tortured to death just so some fuck can keep having coffee? and sunsets are worth watching? the simple life is worth living? Like come on. If I could trade every single moment of happiness that I've ever experienced in my life, from the sight of every sunset, beach, mountain, hill, every bit of beauty, every bit of joy I've ever experienced in my life to prevent a child from experiencing chemotherapy I would. The suffering and the joy were never valued the same, not ever. If you wouldn't make that trade, that tells me a lot about you already. 

I just look at animals and I wish they didn't exist. I look at trees and I wish they didn't exist. I don't like nature anymore. I don't like life anymore. I look at people making more humans and I hate. I see so many justifying all this, chasing a 'feeling', just molecules in their brain. No matter how much optimistic nihilists justify 'creating meaning' I feel how silly it is. I hate the mechanism that gave birth to all this. 

I'm not asking us to live in misery. I'm only asking that we never create another generation and continue this cycle of nonsense. ",16,1739862034.0,antinatalism,6,1.0,False

I’d push them off until later—sometimes even until the next day—just because they felt overwhelming or plain boring. Then I stumbled upon an article on LifeHacksHub about the “eat the frog” method, which basically means knocking out your hardest task first thing in the morning.

I’ve been giving it a try for the past couple of weeks, and honestly, it’s been a game-changer. Every morning, before I get lost in emails or other distractions, I dive into the one task that’s been bugging me the most. Like that report at work I’d been avoiding—I grabbed my coffee at 9 AM and just got on with it. The first few days were rough, but once I finished that daunting task, I felt a huge sense of relief and accomplishment. By noon, I was like, “Phew, the worst is over!” and the rest of my day felt so much lighter. Even my evenings are more relaxed now because I’m not dragging around that nagging worry.

I was so impressed by how this simple change boosted my productivity and eased my stress that I even wrote a quick blog post about it on LifeHacksHub. Now I’m curious—has anyone else tried this? If you also tackle your hardest tasks first thing, how’s it working for you? Or maybe you have other morning routines or hacks that help kick-start your day? I’d love to hear your stories and tips!

Happy Valentine’s Day!

Hey there! I’m Danny, a 30-year-old marketing professional who’s equal parts creative, curious, and driven. I’m looking for someone special to share life’s little joys, big adventures, and everything in between. If you love witty banter, deep conversations, and laughing until your cheeks hurt, we might just click.

What It’s Like Dating Me

	•	The Fun Factor: Whether it’s spontaneous road trips, movie marathons, or an absurdly competitive board game night, life with me is never boring.
	•	Master of Chill Plans: I’m just as happy with cozy nights in, great food, and even better company.
	•	Storytime Pro: My life has been full of ridiculous, hilarious, and unforgettable moments—I promise you won’t be bored.
	•	Life’s Little Perks: From finding hidden gems to knowing the best restaurants, I have a knack for making life feel just a little more exciting.
	•	Your Steady Companion: I’m calm under pressure, dependable, and will always have your back (and your favorite snack).

A Bit About Me


I find joy in creativity, adventure, and great storytelling. Whether I’m exploring a new city, diving into an engrossing book, or losing track of time in a deep conversation, I’m always looking to experience life to the fullest.

Travel is a huge part of who I am—I’ve been to Canada, the USA, Colombia, the Bahamas, and Mexico, and I’m far from done. Bonus: I speak Spanish, so we can plan trips to some incredible places!

When I’m not traveling, you’ll find me immersed in art, music, and film. I love discovering new songs, checking out art exhibits, and getting into philosophical debates over coffee. If you appreciate a mix of thoughtful conversation and playful energy, we’ll get along great.

What I’m Looking For


I’m open to meeting women from all walks of life—what matters most is that we bring out the best in each other. Here’s what I value:

	•	Laughter and Fun: A great sense of humor and a willingness to embrace life’s quirks.
	•	Kind and Open-Minded: Someone who’s genuine, grounded, and up for new experiences.
	•	Emotionally Intelligent: Communication, empathy, and loyalty are key to a strong connection.
	•	A Playful Spirit: Life’s too short to take too seriously—let’s have fun!

Why You Should Message Me


If you’re looking for someone who sees life as an adventure, values deep connections, and brings positivity to every moment, I might just be your guy. Whether it’s finding a new favorite spot, enjoying a lazy Sunday morning, or planning a spontaneous getaway, I’m all in for making memories together.

Let’s Make Memories

The best relationships are built on shared experiences, meaningful conversations, and lots of laughter. Whether it’s exploring a quirky art exhibit, hitting the road for a last-minute trip, or staying in for a movie night, I’m looking for someone who’s excited about the journey.

Final Thoughts

Distance isn’t a dealbreaker if we vibe—it’s about building something real. If you’re adventurous, grounded, and ready for a connection that’s both fun and meaningful, let’s chat.

Okay so I’m (21m) going on a date on Monday. She’s a friend of my sister but we also know of each other from highschool and I know her dad. I asked her straight up if she wanted to get a coffee and she agreed but she’s only available after 5pm because of work. Does it seem okay for me to just ask if she’d like to get dinner instead? And if she says yes I’m paying right? 

My other question is about texting. I was always bad at texting because I would always put so much pressure on myself. It seems like she interested in me enough to continue a convo with me but does that mean I have to constantly think of something to add to the convo? I’m not concerned about talking in person but when it comes to texting that’s where i screw up. Is it normal/okay for me to leave someone on open/read and respond later on in the day or maybe even next day? For example today we talked a little bit about the Ice on the roads and on our cars because we had freezing rain that night, After our little back and forth I just left her on read because I felt the convo ended.

Losing weight can feel like trying to train a cat to fetch. You put in the effort, but the results? 

Questionable.

If you struggle with **bile acid malabsorption**, this process can be even more frustrating.

When your body isn't processing fats properly, **bloating, fatigue, and stubborn weight gain** can become daily battles.

[SuperThin](https://theworldhealth.org/super-thin-official) is a supplement that doesn't just flood your system with stimulants but instead focuses on **bile thinning** to help improve digestion and fat metabolism.

Sounds scientific enough—but does it work? I've dug into the research, read **customer feedback on SuperThin diet pills**, and even had my Mom's neighbor test it. Let's break it down.

# Product Overview

* **Product Name:** **SuperThin**
* **Category:** **Natural Weight Loss Supplement**
* **Overall Verdict:** **4.7/5**

# How Does SuperThin Work?

Most fat burners either suppress appetite or try to crank up your metabolism like a microwave on high. 

**SuperThin**? It works differently. By targeting **bile flow**, this supplement aims to **improve digestion and optimize fat breakdown**.

Bile is your body's natural fat-processing fluid, but when it's too thick or sluggish, digestion slows down, making it easier for fat to linger where you don’t want it.

Reading through **testimonials** to the **effectiveness** of the **SuperThin supplement** suggest that thinning bile can lead to **smoother digestion, reduced bloating, and** [gradual weight loss](https://theworldhealth.org/super-thin-official).

# Ingredients and Formula

A supplement is only as good as what’s inside, and **SuperThin** doesn’t rely on trendy “miracle” ingredients. Instead, it focuses on **scientifically-backed components** that may improve **fat metabolism** and **bile function**.

# Key Ingredients:

* **Grapefruit Extract** – Packed with **naringenin**, which may assist with **fat digestion and metabolism**. Also, great if you enjoy the taste of disappointment (it’s an acquired flavor).

🌿

* **Digestive Enzymes** – These support **gut health and fat breakdown**, helping your stomach process food more efficiently.

🌿

* **Choline** – An essential nutrient involved in **fat transportation and liver function**.

🌿

* **Milk Thistle** – Used for **liver detoxification and bile flow support**.

🌿

While the ingredient list is promising, more transparency on dosages would be helpful for those who like to know exactly what they're putting in their bodies.

# Simon's Personal Experience with SuperThin

Simon, my mom’s neighbor, is the kind of guy who knows every bird species in a three-mile radius and can identify them by sound alone.

He’s also been on a **lifelong mission to lose a few extra pounds**, but his digestion hasn’t always been on his side. When he [heard about SuperThin’s](https://theworldhealth.org/super-thin-official) **bile-thinning approach**, he was intrigued—mostly because he’d “tried everything else short of running laps with the geese.”

After a few weeks, he noticed some **real changes**.

Meals didn’t leave him feeling as heavy, and he wasn’t dealing with the usual bloating after his morning coffee.

The biggest win? He swears he lost a few inches around his waist, enough that his trusty bird-watching vest fit a little looser.

His only complaint? **The capsules had a bit of an herbal aftertaste**, which he wasn’t thrilled about. But in classic Simon fashion, he shrugged and said, “If I can drink coffee at a questionable gas station, I can handle this.”

Overall, Simon felt like **SuperThin helped his digestion and gave him a bit more energy**, making those long afternoons scanning the trees for warblers a little easier.

**Would he recommend it?** Let’s just say he’s already sent my Mom a link to the website.

# Effectiveness and Results

The results of **SuperThin** depend on consistency. Based on **SuperThin weight loss supplement user experiences**, most people report:

* **Smoother digestion and reduced bloating within a few days.**
* **More energy after meals due to improved fat processing.**
* **Gradual weight loss over weeks, rather than a sudden drop.**

That said, **SuperThin isn't a miracle pill**. [The best results](https://theworldhealth.org/super-thin-official) come with a **balanced diet** and **regular movement**. If you expect to lose 20 lbs by sitting on the couch eating fries, you may want to reconsider your approach.

# SuperThin Pros and Cons

* 🟢 **No stimulants**, meaning no jitters or crashes.

I was walking to and from my office, turning on my laptop, bringing coffee and breakfast to my desk, etc. Then I started doing the dishes. Once I finished, I turned around and there was this weird blood like looking substance in a weird zig zag pattern right in the path I was just walking. It was 100% not there before I started doing the dishes. It had the consistency of blood in that it was clotty in some parts and kinda liquidy in others, but it almost looked like fake blood you’d use in a show or something. Like a mix of Jam and ketchup almost? It didn’t have a smell though which was weird. Of course I immediately thought it was my dog, but he didn’t have a trace of blood on him. I looked in his mouth, his butt, in between his paws, literally everywhere and nothing. Also, he had just eaten breakfast, so if it were puke, it’d have food in it. He wasn’t acting weird and even sniffed the substance and didn’t lick it up, which he of course would have if it were jam or ketchup. Also, there were no traces of the blood (or whatever it was) anywhere in the house or the yard. The fridge and the freezer were clean, it wasn’t on the bottom of my socks, not from the walls, no drops anywhere else, etc. Also, the pattern of it was just super weird being zig zaggy like that. Long story short, there is ZERO explanation as to how this substance got there. I didn’t leave the house yet that day or take the trash out or anything. If it were an animal, my dog definitely would’ve seen/smelled it and have been freaking out. One second it wasn’t there and I was walking that same exact path multiple times, then I do the dishes and turn around and it’s there. I’ve been feeling uneasy about it ever since and honestly the only reasoning I can think of is that it was put there from a power not from this earth. Is this crazy for me to think?

It's 4 feet deep on the deep end & 3 feet on the shallow end. I made my own intake bay & created a cascading waterfall with bio filtration. I found slate for free on Facebook marketplace to make a zero edge landscape design & a small sitting patio (picture of my boyfriend for scale! LoL!) And of course slowly added different types of plants for landscaping. 

Currently I have two koi fish in there that have been in there for over a year with no issues. We have one Kikusui & one Butterfly Tancho koi. It also only cost about $350.00 USD to complete the pond (not including the koi.)

 All I have to say is that if you want something you can have it if you put your mind to it - Even if your a 120 lb lady doing it by yourself!
