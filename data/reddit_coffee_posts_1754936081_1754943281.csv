The shots I am pulling are either very low in volume / incredibly sour or very high in volume and watery. I look for the “sweet spot” but there doesn’t seem to be one? The beans are roasted 1 August and I’m using the single wall basket as per instructions. 
Is there a user error on my part? I also notice considerable channelling when it delivers higher volume, watery espresso which means grind finer or the tamp is wrong.. it always says “high tamp” but no overflowing coffee in the basket. I’m going by the machines dosing here.

Proof of His Infidelity

Chapter 1
At twenty-six, Jennifer Weiss married Cleo Ayers, the man who had pursued her relentlessly for six years. But less than a year into their marriage, she discovered he was keeping a mistress.
Back entrance of the Bemrough Ballet Company.
Jennifer stood still, her back against the cold wall, listening to the breathy moans drifting out from the studio.
A woman's voice, low and urgent, broke through the muffled silence. ""Cleo... it feels so good... faster...""
Jennifer's nails dug deep into her palm.
Her husband, Cleo, was inside-hooking up with her student, Debbie Norris.
Just minutes earlier, she had received a text. [Ms. Weiss, want to know who your husband's sleeping with? Come to Studio 3.]
Even now, she didn't want to believe it.
They'd only been married a year. How could the love fade so fast?
She stepped forward and knocked on the door.
The voices stopped abruptly. She held her breath.
The door swung open almost instantly, and a wave of strong perfume rushed out.
Debbie stood there in a blush-pink tulle dress, her long, toned legs bare-no sign of the usual ballet tights.
Her cheeks were flushed, her lips slightly swollen. Her gaze was lazy, seductive. She blinked prettily and greeted her, all sweetness, ""Hi, Ms. Weiss!""
Debbie was the rising star Jennifer had discovered and nurtured over the past three years-her hand-picked protege, widely regarded as her successor. Because of her resemblance to Jennifer, people at the company often called her ""Little Jennifer.""
One hand, nails painted a vivid red, rested casually on the doorframe. Around her wrist was a blood-red diamond bracelet-impossible to miss.
Jennifer recognized it instantly.
It was the exact same bracelet Cleo had bought for her at an auction on his last business trip to Uwonard.
Down to every detail.
Warm air blew gently from the overhead heater, but Jennifer felt like she'd fallen into a frozen lake.
She steadied her voice. ""I heard you took some time off from training. Thought I'd drop by. Are you here alone?"" She stepped forward, trying to enter.
Debbie quickly blocked the doorway, a coy blush spreading across her face. ""Ms. Weiss, my boyfriend's here... we were, uh... now's not really a good time.""
Jennifer had heard about Debbie's so-called ""mystery boyfriend.""
She took another step forward. Debbie promptly shut the door in her face. ""Really, Ms. Weiss. It's just not convenient.""
Not convenient? Or was it because the man inside was Cleo?
Jennifer pulled out her phone and dialed Cleo's number, holding it close to her ear.
Inside the studio-dead silence. No ringtone. No sound at all.
Her blood turned to ice.
She limped quickly around the corridor to the front entrance of the studio-her right foot still recovering from an old injury-intent on catching them in the act.
As she moved, memories came rushing back in waves...
Everyone in Bemrough knew Cleo-the elegant, untouchable heir to the Ayers family. Polished, reserved, aloof. His private life was famously clean, even cold. He was said to be completely uninterested in women.
That was, until Swan Lake-when he first saw Jennifer dance as the White Swan.
Love at first sight.
From that moment on, he pursued her with unwavering passion for six full years. Every day, a bouquet of fresh white roses delivered right to her door. He never missed a single performance, always sending flowers in person.
Jennifer had grown up watching her father cheat, her mother spiral into madness and stab the mistress. Her family had crumbled. She'd long since stopped believing in love, let alone marriage. Add to that the vast gap between their backgrounds-she rejected him again and again.
But Cleo never gave up. Persistent. Devoted. Steadfast.
Until the car crash.
To protect her, he'd thrown himself over the seat-unbuckling his belt in the process-taking the full impact. Multiple broken ribs. A punctured lung. Days in a coma in the ICU.
Chapter 2
That was the moment her heart finally cracked open.
Now, standing at the end of the hallway, Jennifer stared at the front entrance of the studio-waiting. Watching. But no one came out.
""Babe.""
A deep, familiar voice spoke from behind her. Jennifer spun around.
Cleo was walking toward her.
Impeccably dressed-perfectly tailored suit, white shirt buttoned up to the collar, tie knotted precisely. A black coat hung casually over his shoulder. Not a hair out of place. Not a hint of guilt.
He stopped just in front of her, the cool scent of mint brushing past her nose.
Mouthwash.
He'd quit smoking three months ago. And it wasn't anywhere near mealtime.
""You went by the office to find me just now?"" he asked calmly.
Jennifer's gaze locked onto his face, sharp and unblinking.
There wasn't the slightest flicker of emotion on Cleo's sharp, elegant face. He spoke in a warm, even voice, ""Yes. What about you? What are you doing here?""
""Checking on student training,"" Jennifer replied smoothly, her tone neutral.
Cleo nodded, then naturally slipped his arm around her and walked her out of the ballet company. The two of them got into a Rolls-Royce Phantom parked under the shade of the plane trees.
As soon as they were seated, he handed her a warm cup of coffee with sugar.
He had a private app on his phone that tracked her entire cycle. Her period was due in just a couple of days.
Looking at him-still so thoughtful and considerate-Jennifer felt a moment of confusion, a crack in her certainty.
She forced a small smile and asked casually, ""Mr. Ayers, where's that bracelet you bought for me at the auction?""
But her fingers clenched tightly around the cold metal of the thermos cup.
Cleo smiled faintly. He reached into his coat pocket and took out a navy velvet jewelry box. He flipped it open.
Inside lay a blood-red diamond bracelet, gleaming with a subtle, dazzling glow.
Jennifer froze.
'So... the man in the studio wasn't him?'
Cleo gently took her hand and slid the bracelet onto her wrist.
His warm fingertips brushed over her skin as he fastened the clasp. He studied her wrist admiringly, eyes lighting up with appreciation. ""Only a top-grade gem like this,"" he said, ""is worthy of my wife's beauty.""
The fine, old-mine ruby shimmered like fire against her pale skin, making it look even more translucent and flawless.
Jennifer snapped back to reality and said calmly, ""It is beautiful. Funny coincidence though-my student, Debbie, has one that looks exactly the same.""
Cleo raised an eyebrow, lips lifting into a confident curve. ""You must be mistaken. It was a one-of-a-kind auction piece. There can't be a second.""
His expression didn't waver.
A faint glimmer of hope flickered in Jennifer's chest.
'Could I really be wrong?
'Then what about the message? Has it all just been a sick joke?'
The Phantom pulled into a luxury gated community and stopped in front of a private villa.
Cleo carefully helped her out of the car. Three months earlier, while searching for him after an accident in the mountains, she had slipped down a wet slope and badly injured her ankle. The damage left her with a permanent limp.
As they stepped inside, the housekeeper, Kenya Fowler, came forward to greet them. ""Ma'am, you had a package delivered today. I signed for it.""
Cleo handed his coat to Kenya, then casually loosened his tie. His eyes swept over to Jennifer, warm and amused. ""My wife's shopping online? What'd you get this time?""
Jennifer hesitated for a second before replying smoothly, ""It's from Flossie-her latest book, signed edition."" Flossie Kelly was her close friend, a well-known self-help blogger with millions of followers.
Cleo nodded. ""I'm going to shower. Long day. I feel a bit grimy.""
Jennifer picked up the package and headed back to her room.
Chapter 3
Since they got married, they had always slept in separate bedrooms.
She opened the box-and her breath caught.
Inside was a black lace nightdress. Sexy, bold, and completely unlike her usual style.
Just then, her phone buzzed.
A new anonymous message popped up on the screen.
[Ms. Weiss, I heard you're sick-won't even sleep with your husband. Do you even love him?]
""Sick."" That word stabbed her right in the chest.
Because it wasn't a lie.
Nearly a year into their marriage, Jennifer and Cleo still hadn't been intimate. Even basic physical contact could send her into cold sweats-nausea, trembling, and an overwhelming sense of panic.
Just last Friday, Flossie had run another psychological assessment. The results had improved slightly. She'd encouraged Jennifer to try initiating intimacy, even just a small step.
This black nightdress-Jennifer had ordered it two days ago.
It was meant to be a surprise for Cleo when he came back from his trip.
*****
Cleo emerged from the shower and stepped into her room.
Jennifer stood by the wardrobe.
A slim white turtleneck sweater hugged her frame, outlining her graceful shoulders. Her hair was swept up in a neat bun, exposing the smooth line of her neck and a cool, refined face-so pure it seemed untouched by the world.
Cleo's Adam's apple shifted slightly.
Then he walked in.
Jennifer turned at the sound of the door.
Cleo was wearing a dark blue robe, his tall frame moving toward her with measured ease.
The V-shaped collar lay open, revealing the sharp lines of his chest-and faint scars that still traced across his skin. A reminder of the accident.
He stopped in front of her, towering above.
His hand came up and gently cupped her face. In his deep, dark eyes, desire surged-undeniable and unhidden.
His handsome face lowered toward hers, breath brushing against her skin.
The naked desire in Cleo's dark eyes hit Jennifer like a punch to the gut-and in an instant, the shadows of her childhood came crashing back.
""No-don't!""
She shoved hard against his chest. Her entire body trembled violently, out of her control, her face pale as a sheet.
Cleo stiffened. A flash of frustration and helplessness crossed his eyes before he quickly regained his composure.
He stepped back, letting go of her, his voice low and soft, gentle as a whisper. ""I'm sorry. I shouldn't have pushed you.""
Jennifer forced herself to breathe, to stay composed. Seeing the raw guilt in his eyes made her throat tighten. Her nose stung, and her eyes began to burn.
When he leaned in to kiss her, all she could see was the sickening image from her childhood-her father, naked and entangled with his mistress. That memory had branded itself into her mind and refused to let go.
""Please... don't force me,"" she said, her voice still shaking.
It was painfully clear-six months of therapy hadn't done much.
Cleo gave her a patient, indulgent smile. His gaze was full of warmth. He gently brushed a stray lock of hair from her cheek. ""Okay,"" he said softly. ""We'll wait until you're ready, sweetheart.""
He gave her cheek a light squeeze, his tone firm but reassuring. ""No guilt. I'm happy to wait.""
His gentleness made something inside her melt. She felt a wave of warmth rise in her chest. Moved, she stepped forward and opened her arms to hug him.
But just then, her phone rang-shrill and sudden.
Cleo quickly pulled out his own phone from the pocket of his robe. As the screen lit up, he instinctively turned it away, shielding it slightly with his hand.
Jennifer caught a glimpse.
The screen was completely dark-he had a privacy filter.
She paused, slightly thrown.
Cleo looked up, his voice light and casual. ""Babe, I just need to take this call."" Then he added naturally, ""It's Geraldo.""

1mnnov0,https://i.redd.it/0jg6c7m86gif1.jpeg,"Forget what you know, Panama's food scene is a culinary goldmine","If you’re the kind of traveler who plans your itinerary around meals (same here), Panama might surprise you—in the best way. We teamed up with local chef José Olmedo Carles Rojas to uncover some of the most authentic, unexpected, and delicious spots in Panama City. 

This isn’t your typical tourist food list. Here’s what to check out: 

Start Your Day with Dim Sum  

Who knew dim sum was a thing in Panama City? Chef José swears by Lung Fung for the best dim sum to start your day. 

Seafood Straight from the Boat 

The Mercado de Mariscos (Seafood Market) is where it's at. Think fresh ceviche and lobster right off the boat. Can't get more authentic than that. 

Casual Eats by the Sea 

For a no-frills, all-flavor experience, head to Restaurante Adriana. It's a beachside spot known for simple cooking that lets the incredible ingredients shine. 

**Inventive dining** 

If you're looking for something a bit more inventive, José's own restaurant, Fonda Lo Que Hay, is a must-visit. The menu changes often, but if “Sexy Clams” is on offer, don’t skip it. 

**Coffee worth traveling for** 

Panama is famous for its Geisha coffee, and Sisu Coffee Studio is the place to get a high-quality cup. 

**Why it’s worth it** 

Panama’s food scene blends Caribbean, Latin American, and Asian influences with a local twist. It’s affordable, diverse, and full of surprises – especially if you go beyond the tourist trail.

Hey witches,
I wanted to share my recent ritual and get some feedback and opinions? whether I missed signs or if it’s one of those “set and forget” things. I have a whole script I made for my ritual, but I don't know about sharing it.but i can elaborate on anything if asked. 

I planned a truth-seeking ritual calling on Mercury, my guides/ancestors, and the wind spirits. It was a windy Wednesday at dusk,  (felt like a good sign already). I prepped tea, coffee, cookies as offerings, plus a candle, mirror, and my written script. I set everything on my balcony on a little makeshift altar.

I’d taken an edible beforehand (I usually feel more witchy/connected that way), but I was also a bit loopy and distracted. I kept worrying someone would come home and catch me mid-ritual, which made it hard to focus. I read through my script, watched the candle (leaning to the right the whole time, flame never went out), and tried to listen to the wind, but only heard random street noise.

I sealed a letter to Mercury with wax, drew a sigil, sang the ritual song softly (felt too self-conscious to sing loud). I forgot the bay leaf burning part entirely. Left the offerings for 24 hours; when I came back, the tea/coffee had evaporated and left a dark ring on the mugs.

Since then… nothing obvious. No signs, no unusual events. I’m feeling a bit disillusioned, like maybe nothing happened at all, even though I know sometimes these things take time.

So, what do you think? Did I miss subtle signs? Did my edible + distraction kill the energy? Should I follow up or just leave it alone and wait? What to look out for? ",1,1754942881.0,witchcraft,1,1.0,False

1mnnl57,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1mnnl57/was_i_wrong_to_voice_this/,Was I wrong to voice this?,"I hadn’t seen my partner (Aspen) for nearly 5 weeks. She had been away on holiday with her live in partner for 2.5weeks. I was hoping to see her when she got back. I asked 3 separate times - she said no each time - she had upset with her live in partner one day, too busy another and the last was due to childcare. She never asked if I was free any other time to rearrange. 

One day she didn’t say goodnight to me - we always do. She had been busy with work, then she’d gone to her club, then she went to see her other partner (birch) and then went home and chatted with her family. She used to text me when she was done at her club, or when she left birch, or when she got home but she didn’t. It made me feel like there was no urgency for me and I felt like I didn’t matter. I think it was the whole pattern - in those 2 weeks, she saw birch 3 times. Granted she sees him after club and another night was a club night out so it was convenient but still she made that time after club for birch. I know I shouldn’t compare but it hurt that she didn’t even send me a text that took 2 mins to write that night. 

I saw her at the weekend - it was a date we had planned months ago and I wonder if she would have bothered seeing me if it wasn’t arranged. I told her that I didn’t know how she felt about me, when I didn’t go to kiss her at first. She seemed confused why I would think i would think that. I said I felt like the last person in her day, and that I was the last in the queue lately. She doesn’t tend to share her feelings, give me compliments or say romantic things or say that she wants me sexually or talk like that. It’s generally more platonic chat with some flirting. If I try to deviate from this she shuts me down. So when she doesn’t want to see me and doesn’t make effort to say another time, it makes me question, especially after it being 5 weeks without having any intentional time with her. 

Birch and her daughter will be leaving soon. Birch won’t see her for 6 months and her daughter sporadically as she goes to college. I am trying to be fair as I know she will miss them. She said to me she was making the most of her time with them while they are here. I get that but I asked for 5 mins of her time so I could just see her and give her a kiss and connect with her and it was denied. Texting is reduced at night as she focuses on her daughter. She said she guessed she had just been waiting for the date we arranged - that kinda hurt as I had been excited to see her but it didn’t feel like that from her end - there was no ‘I’ve missed you’ or ‘I can’t wait to spend some time with you’. 

I’ll get to start seeing her daily from next month in a group setting, but it will have been 2 months of this reduced communication and I will have only spent 2 occasions alone with her on a date (we usually have quality time in some form once a week). 

She’s a fearful avoidant and is now avoiding hard and has gone quiet. I just wanted to express how I feel but I don’t know if I was wrong. I was trying to be considerate of her time and asked for the tiniest crumbs - 5 mins just to give her a kiss or a coffee. Not hours in a date. I just wanted to reconnect. I feel like she sees me as someone who is always around so my needs can wait. In fact she listed all the people and about them going and then ended with ‘and there’s always you’.

I sit patiently at my desk, the towering skyscrapers outside my window looming like silent, steel giants. The faint hum of the office AC and the rhythmic tap of keyboards are the only sounds that break the otherwise stifling silence. I work a typical nine-to-five in a small office department. No wife, no kids, and I pay monthly rent on an overpriced apartment- that I can barely call home. By every definition, I’m just an average guy. But no one is really average. We're all full of details, oddities, dreams we keep hidden. I've got mine, and I keep them locked tight. I live quietly, but inside, I'm constantly dreaming. Fantasizing. Wanting. Something more. Something else. Each morning, I watch the others arrive-colleagues shuffling in with ghostly faces and automated greetings. Coffee poured, same seats claimed, keyboards clicking in the same dull rhythm. It's like watching mannequins practice being human. The whole thing moves like a machine with no soul. An endless loop. A hamster wheel spinning toward nothing. At 5:15, almost every day, I leave the parking lot. My boss won't release us until 5:07, and even then, there's always small talk and fake goodbyes. But after that, l'm out. A few left turns, a few rights, and I arrive. The auditorium. It screams of neglect. Velvet seats ripped and stained, dust thick in the air, as if the place has been holding its breath for years. But to me, this place pulses with possibility. Every broken chair is a relic of the magic that once lived here. This place feels sacred.

I've been preparing for this moment for months— rehearsing in my mind every night, obsessively chasing perfection. This is it. My shot. My dream. Since I was seven, l've wanted to be a magician. It started at my seventh birthday party. My parents hired one. A real showman. Flashy tricks, booming voice, applause that shook the room. I was mesmerized. My classmate cheered, laughed, screamed in amazement. In that moment, I knew-this is what I want. That adoration.

And I've never really let go of that dream. Not once. It’s always at the back of my mind. Before bed, in dreams, during lectures and meetings, Commuting to work, l imagined it all. My audience. Their cheers. Their love. Even if we bury it, even if we fear it, we all crave it: to be something more. To be someone special. For me, it was magic.

If this goes right tonight, maybe everything will finally make sense. Maybe I'll be fixed. The lights go down. Curtain rises. I step onto the stage and speak into the mic: ""Presenting... Mikey the Magic Man."" I start with the basics. Sleight of hand. Coin vanishes. Cards reappear. They clap, but it's not the right kind. It's too polite. Too soft. Not the kind I need.

I pivot fast, heart thudding. The saw act. The one from my birthday. The one that made the kids scream in wonder. It's simple. Classic. I've practiced it endlessly. I know every movement. I begin. The saw slides cleanly through her pulsing figure. Her body splits, just as planned. The illusion is flawless. I glance at the crowd, waiting for the applause. Nothing. Just silence. Then-twisting faces. Horror. Eyes wide, mouths open. I see disgust, not amazement. Something's very wrong.

I turn back to the stage-and I freeze. She's not moving. Her body isn't an illusion. It's real. It's wrong. Blood gushes out. Guts tumble onto the stage floor like wet rope. I choke on the deathly smell-sour and metallic. My stomach turns. My grip looses the saw. It thuds against her chest-right in her still pumping heart.

I stagger back. Screams erupt. Chairs crash.  Greasy Popcorn flies. Someone throws a drink. It hits me like carbonated wind. The crowd tramples the stage, howling in panic. I raise my hands. I beg. I plead. But the words come out broken. Useless. I did everything right. Didn't I?

Everything unravels. My mind spins. My chest caves in. Did any of it ever make sense? Or have I always been spiraling, mistaking obsession for purpose? What was once complete, was then incomplete, now completely broken. The revolving door-it never stops. Round and round. Until you step out. But I can't. I drop to my knees and scream. The pain bursts out of me, flooding in agony. I claw at my scalp, nails digging into skin, ripping out tufts of hair. The screams become a chorus. I sob until I can't breathe. Until it feels like something inside me splits. Then I go further. My fingers dig into my eyes. Bright white and blue. Then red. Then black. Next is my skin, peels sliding off of me like a bad sunburn, what was once my face laying on the stage, holes dug in like a rotten fruit. The stark, white bones of my shattered dreams remain on my decrepit body. My mangled skeleton figure is still being trashed by the crowd,No spotlight. No applause. Just the ruin of my dream, shattered and still. I've reduced myself to nothing. To nobody.

8:37 A.M Then comes nine. Same fruitless greetings, same stale coffee, same beat-down desk, same everything.

I’m back at the hamsters wheel. Running again and again, trying to catch something I never can.

At 5:07, We’ll be dismissed.

At 5:15, I’ll leave.

There may be small talk in the parking lot.

After, I’ll disappear time after time. Just to fail once again. Rinse and Repeat. The revolving door keeps its orbit, and I am still inside.",2,1754942669.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

**Key Topics and Discussion Points**

*Ch. 6 The Long Waltz*

* Rare instances of HS-*Sodalis* infection in humans provides a glimpse into the theory that mutualists evolve from initially pathogenic interactions
* Beewolf mothers create a paste containing [Streptomyces bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptomyces) to protect their young with the antibiotics they produce.  The young then eat the bacteria upon emerging from their burrow, that they in turn pass onto their own young. This leads to a larger discussion of how microbes are transferred through the generations from parent to offspring.
* The [hydra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_(genus)) & how despite only having two layers of epithelium, has very distinct and varied microbiomes between related species, suggesting that different species actively sculpt their own microbiomes, allowing certain microbes in while keeping others out.
* [Endosymbiosis theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosymbiont), developed by biologist Lynn Margulis & printed in 1967, and how it led to Eugene Rosenberg and Ilana Zilber-Rosenberg to develop the holobiont concept, and advocated for using the [hologenome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hologenome_theory_of_evolution) as the unit of natural selection.
* The controversy of the hologenome concept and its relationship to the old notion of symbiosis.  On the one hand, there are scientists like Rosenberg & Zilber-Rosenberg who argue that the hologenome is the crux of natural selection, and we cannot fully understand evolution of an organism without accounting for all of the genes within it, including its microbes.  Critics call the theory “hokey”, citing that the theory glosses over the conflicts between organisms and their microbes.  Other scientists argue that the theory does accommodate conflict, as it really focuses only on the organisms that stay with an organism throughout its life, not those just passing through.  Still, others argue that symbiosis already accounts for this.
   * The Rosenbergs have performed experiments on flies, which show that the content of their gut microbes can influence an individual’s choice of mate.  By showing that microbes living in the gut can influence sexual selection & therefore reproduction, they provide some evidence that microbes could drive the origin of new species.

*Ch. 7 Mutually Assured Success*

* Insects in the [Hemiptera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiptera) order (bed bugs, assassin bugs, leafhoppers, aphids) have symbionts called *Buchnera*.  Scientist Nancy Moran showed that the family tree of *Buchnera* strains mirrors those of the aphids they colonize, suggesting they were colonized once around 200 to 250 million years ago and have been living together ever since.  *Bucherna* makes some of the essential amino acids that the aphids cannot produce on their own, and allow them to gain energy from plant phloem sap.
* A team of 3 geologists take the submarine *Alvin* into the hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean near the Galapagos Islands, and unexpectedly find it teeming with life, including giants worms, since named [Riftia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riftia), who have no mouth, anus, or gut.  Instead, they have bacteria in their trophosome, which help them break down sulphur compounds into energy using a process called [chemosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemosynthesis).
* Scientist Ruth Ley collected stool samples from 60 different species and compared the DNA of the microbes living in the animals’ guts.  She found that herbivores had different microbes than carnivores, with omnivores somewhere in the middle.  Plant-eating mammals evolved different microbes in order to digest this new nutritional food source, and the structure of their guts enhances this ability.  Animals such as cows house their microbes in a foregut, giving them an edge when eating plant matter like straw.  Foregut mammals have different microbes than hindgut mammals, which indicates that microbes have a role to play in the evolution of the gut.
   * This is not just true for mammals.  The structure of termite guts also varies with their microbiome.  Termites with cow-like guts house more bacteria, while those that don’t house more protists, both of which help them break down wood.
* Our microbiomes can also change quickly in the short-term, based on our varying diets.  This was shown by researcher Katherine Amato, who studied the effects of seasonal changes in diet on the gut microbiota of howler monkeys.  These changes can occur daily as well, and has been shown in experiments on people asked to keep to a strict diet for 5 days.  
* Some animals have special adaptations that allow them to eat toxic plants, which sometimes take the form of microbes.  The desert woodrat is capable of eating from the creosote bush, which is highly toxic to the liver and kidneys.  Kevin Kohl experimented with woodrats in different locations, some in areas with the [creosote bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larrea_tridentata) and some without.  Woodrats from locations with the plant had toxin-degrading genes activated when given the creosote bush to eat, while their Great Basin cousins did not.  When dosed with antibiotics, the experienced woodrats were no longer able to eat the creosote bush without harmful effects.
* [Mountain pine beetles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_pine_beetle) have been wrecking havoc on North American pine trees, which associate with two species of fungi to assist in breaking down the tree bark.  In defense, the trees produce large amounts of terpenes.  However, the beetles have also teamed up with bacteria like *Pseudomonas*  and *Rahnella*, which degrade these terpenes and leave the trees defenseless against the boring-beetles.

*Ch. 8 Allegro in E Major*

* Bacteria have this unique ability called [Horizontal Gene Transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer), which allows them to share genes with their fellow microbes.  This is one of the main mechanisms behind antibiotic resistance. Once transferred between microbes horizontally, those newly acquired genes can then be transferred vertically to offspring by asexual reproduction (the typical splitting of the bacteria cell into 2 that we are accustomed to).
* The ability to break down the [seaweed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyra) *Porphyra* is associated with the marine microbe, *Zobellia galactanivorans*.  This organism is imbibed by people who eat the seaweed, but does not stay long in the human gut.  Instead, it appears that the seaweed-degrading gene from *Zobellia* was transferred to the gut microbe *Bacteroides plebius*, which allows their human hosts to gain nutrients from the seaweed.  
* HRT between microbes has been known for awhile, but the idea that bacterial genes could make their way into animal hosts was brushed aside until results from the [Human Genome Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project) were first published in 2001.  The project identifed 223 human genes that were shared with bacteria but not with other animals.
   * More evidence for this idea surfaced in 2005 with Julia Dunning-Hotopp’s work with the fly *Drosophila ananassae*.  She found genes from *Wolbachia* inside the fly’s genome, and originally thought it was contamination.  But after treating the flies with antibiotics, the genes persisted.  She later realized that the entire *Wolbachia* genome was encoded within the fly’s genome.
   * Some other examples of animals with microbe genes encoded in their own genome are the coffee-borer beetle, which has a bacterial gene that allows its larvae to break down carbohydrates within coffee beans.  Braconid wasps have bracovirus genes totally integrated with their own, which they use to attack caterpillars.
* We are introduced to the citrus mealybug, which has a bacterium called *Tremblaya* as a symbiont, which itself holds another bacterium called *Moranella* inside of its cells.  The result is that all 3 organisms have lost some of their genes, reduced to only the genes that they need to produce for the thruple to survive, at least as far as phenylalanine production goes.  This requires 9 enzymes, and each organism produces a subset, so that each relies on the others to make up the difference.
* Moving back to aphids, we meet a species that has *Hamiltonella defensa* as a symbiont, which allows it to kill parasitic wasps.  The bacterium’s secret is that it actually has the DNA of a phage embedded into its own, which it can unleash to attack the invading wasps.  The strangest part of this story is that the bacterium is transferred from one insect to another via sex, which instantly confers resistance to the wasps.  
* There is a similar alliance developing between fruit flies, nematode worms, and a strange bacterium called *Spiroplasma*.  In the 1980s, specimens did not contain any trace of the bacterium.  In 2010, around 50-80% of fruit flies in North America contained the bacterium, and it is still spreading through the population.

Transcript

0:00My name is Lucas. For years, I was the pastor of a vibrant congregation, a man0:05consumed by the work of the Lord. I preached the love of God, the power of his resurrection, and above all, the0:12unwavering hope of the rapture. I spoke of it with a passion that ignited the hearts of my people because it was the0:18promise I kept. Testimony. My own soul clung to holiness, the longing to see my0:24savior face to face. But everything changed one night. It wasn't a dream or a mystical vision, but a crushing0:31certainty that the Holy Spirit planted in my heart. I was in my study with my Bible open, and the heavy expectation of0:38Christ's coming filled me. Suddenly, the air became dense. There was no roar or0:44flash, only a stillness so profound that I felt my own breath stop. It was then0:49that I heard the voice, not with my physical ears, but in the depths of my spirit, clear and sharp as a sword. The0:56Holy Spirit told me, Luke, that many will not ascend in the rapture because of this. The voice didn't stop there. In1:04a flash of understanding, he showed me not a list of obvious sins like adultery or theft, which are already evident in1:11the light of scripture. He revealed to me something far more insidious and widespread, something that has taken1:18root in the hearts of the church like a silent weed. He showed me the deep and deeprooted love for the world and the1:24things of the world. In that revelation, I saw images that took my breath away. I1:29saw church leaders, men and women I admired in a frenzy for fame, platform,1:35and recognition. I saw how their ministries, which had once been born out of genuine passion, had transformed into1:42well polished businesses. Their messages tweaked to be more appealing and less confrontational. Their hearts were not1:48set on lost souls, but on the number of likes, sponsorships, and the size of1:54their audiences, and the Holy Spirit made this ambition clear to me. This love for glitter and human admiration is2:01a bond that will not be broken when the trumpet sounds. Then I saw devout believers attending every service. They2:08tithed faithfully and served in every ministry, but whose true devotion lay in their possessions. There was a sister so2:14faithful in prayer that she spent more time planning her next luxury trip or decorating her home with the latest2:21trends than in sincere communion with God. I saw a brother, a pillar in the church, whose happiness came not from2:28his relationship with Christ, but from the latest technological upgrade he had purchased. His prayers were a formality,2:35but his true hopes and dreams were intertwined with financial success, social status, and the accumulation of2:42possessions. Today the spirit showed me how this modern idolatry is the veil that clouds spiritual vision. Love for2:49the world is not only a sin. It is an anchor that keeps a soul firmly planted on the ground. A heart that is divided2:56between Christ and the world lacks the purity and lightness necessary. To be raptured is like a sky diver trying to3:04ascend with the weight of rocks in his backpack. It is simply not possible. The most painful thing about the revelation3:10was seeing how I myself had fallen into this trap. I had preached against materialism, but secretly my heart3:17rejoiced in the idea of a larger ministry with more influence and recognition. The same passion that moved3:23me to preach the rapture was sometimes contaminated with the desire to be me. Luke, the influential pastor, the3:30respected man of God, and not just a humble servant. It was in that moment of self-awareness that the voice of the3:36Holy Spirit returned with greater force. Many will not ascend because of this, Luke, and you were almost one of them.3:44That night, my vision of the rapture was completely transformed. It stopped being a distant promise, becoming an imminent3:51and personal test. It wasn't about being ready the way we thought, avoiding obvious sins. It was about the inner3:58condition of our hearts, the purity of our motives. It was about whether the weight of the world was keeping us4:05anchored. I have written these words for you not as a judgment but as the warning I received. If your heart felt4:11uncomfortable, if any of these words have touched you, I beg you to stop and reflect because what I am telling you is4:18not a theory. It is a message of urgency that the Holy Spirit gave me. And it is4:23the reason I have left everything behind to share it. The message of the Holy Spirit left me not only with an4:30overwhelming weight, but with a desperate thirst to understand. My mind, which for years had been filled with4:36sermons, church growth strategies, and ministry plans, could now only focus on4:42one question. How could I have been so blind? I felt like a modern-day Pharisee4:47preaching a truth that in my own heart I had not fully embraced the conviction that love for the world was a fatal4:53bondage to the rapture forced me to dismantle every belief I had built on the sanctity of my own life. That night5:00I couldn't sleep. I grabbed my Bible not to look for a passage that would confirm5:05my theology but to find an answer for my soul. I scoured the epistles of Paul,5:11the letters of Peter, and the words of Jesus in the Gospels, but this time with a completely new perspective. I no5:18longer looked for verses for my sermons, but rather mirrors that would show me my own heart. What I saw terrified me. I5:25saw how prosperity had become a consumer gospel. I saw how faith had been reduced5:30to a transaction. believe in order to receive. So in order to reap, I saw how5:36the church, the body of Christ had fragmented into a series of brands, each5:41vying for attention, followers, and money. And I realized that I, Luke, had5:46been an architect of that system. My sermons about blessings often sounded more like promises of earthly success5:53than a call to the cross. My plans for the church always included numerical and5:58financial growth because that was what it was that the world gave me a success. It was in a wan dos 15 script 17 where I6:06found the hardest and most forceful answer. Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the6:13world, the love of the father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the desires of the flesh, the desires of the6:20eyes, and the pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world, and the world passes away, and its desires.6:28But whoever does the will of God remains forever. That passage I had preached countless times now struck me like a6:34fresh revelation. The key wasn't simply not to commit sins, but rather to keep6:39my heart anchored to what is fleeting. The lust of the eyes and the pride of life weren't just about immorality, but6:46also about the insatiable pursuit of status. From social approval and recognition above humility, I realized6:53that the platform I so longed for was not Gods, but the worlds. The respect of men was an idol I had been secretly7:00worshiping. I began to make a mental list, not of my sins, but of my attachments, the luxury car I had bought7:07to give glory to God and project an image of success. The time I invested in social media to ensure my messages7:14reached more people instead of spending that time in prayer. The subtle satisfaction I felt when someone called7:21me a pastor with reverence, a pride that had infiltrated my ego. Each of those small attachments was a rock in my7:28backpack, a weight that had prevented me from flying. I realized that the rapture will not be for those who have achieved7:35a level of holiness measured by human standards. It will be for those with a pure heart. Those who, like the Apostle7:42Paul, consider everything else as garbage for the love of Christ. True love for the Father is incompatible with7:49love for the world. There cannot be two teachers. This was the truth that confronted me and broke me. At that7:55moment, I knew I could no longer be the pastor that the world and the church had created. I could no longer preach a8:02holiness that I myself did not live. Deep in my heart, it was a farce. And if8:07anything became clear to me from the voice of the spirit, it is that the rapture is the final dividing line8:13between the reality of a transformed heart and the illusion of a superficial faith. I was in the midst of an8:19illusion, and I had to make a decision that would change the course of my life forever. The decision was not easy. It8:25was a battle, one whole night with my face on the ground, fighting not against the will of God, but against my own8:32flesh. My rational mind screamed at me that it was crazy to leave the church I8:37had planted and watched grow. Leaving the pull pit, the platform, the influence I had worked so hard to build.8:44My ego, my reputation, my financial security, everything was at stake. The8:49devil was whispering lies to me. You will become irrelevant. You will lose the respect of your colleagues. What8:55will you tell your family? You are a coward. But in the midst of that storm,9:00the voice of the Holy Spirit was an anchor. It reminded me that true relevance is not measured by the number9:06of attendees at a service, but by the purity of a heart. When the sun rose, my9:12decision was made. I could no longer be a pastor who preached renunciation of the world while my own heart was tied to9:19it. My ministry had become a reflection of what the world considered success, not of the radical truth of the gospel.9:26I felt a strange peace, a lightness. I hadn't experienced in years. It was the9:31peace that comes from letting go of the weight of shedding the anchor that kept me grounded. The first person I told was9:37my wife, Anna. I waited until the children were asleep and sat her down on the couch room and with my voice9:44breaking, I explained everything to him. I told him the revelation of the Holy Spirit, the conviction about the love of9:51the world and vain glory and the deep shame of having discovered those ties in my own heart. I told her I couldn't9:58continue, that I had to resign from my past. Her eyes full of surprise at10:04first, then filled with fear. Lucas, what are you talking about? Our10:09children, the debts, the ministry, where are we going to go today? Her questions10:15were not a lack of faith, but a natural reaction to such a radical truth. I assured her that the same voice that had10:21called me to resign was the same voice that would sustain us, that if God was in this, he would open the way. I10:28reminded her that the promise of a new heaven and a new earth was more valuable than anything we had in this life. It10:34was the most difficult conversation of my life. But in her tears, and in her silence, I knew that she would support10:41me in the end. The next day, I met with the elders of the church, men I had10:46discipled, with whom I had prayed and shared battles. I told them that the Holy Spirit had spoken to me. I10:52explained the burden, the revelation about the shackles of the world. Their reaction wasn't one of understanding,10:58but of bewilderment. They looked at each other with a mixture of pity and concern. Lucas, are you okay? Have you11:06been sleeping enough? One asked, ""Maybe you need a vacation. Are you exhausted?""11:12Another said, they couldn't understand that the revelation wasn't the result of tiredness, but of divine intervention. I11:19handed them my letter of resignation. It was a moment of profound loneliness. In11:24that instant, I realized that my identity as Pastor Lucas had disappeared. From one day to the next, I11:31was nothing more than Lucas, a man who had given up everything to follow a conviction of a spirit. The news spread11:37like wildfire. A few understood, or at least tried to, but the vast majority of11:43the congregation saw it as a failure. Lucas burned out. They said he couldn't11:48handle the pressure. The people I had loved and served for years now saw me as a tragic figure, or worse, a deserter.11:56The phone stopped ringing. The invitations dried up. The platform, the status, the admiration, everything I had12:04once believed was part of me. Ministry evaporated. And in the loneliness of my12:09new reality, I realized an even more painful truth. The love I received wasn't for Christ in me, but for the12:16position I occupied. It was the love of the world, and the world had let me go.12:21But in that free fall, I found a freedom I had never known. I no longer had to worry about the size of the offering or12:28what people would think of my sermon or the image my ministry projected. The only audience I now had to please was12:35the Holy Spirit. I took on a secular job to support my family. And for the first12:40time, my free time was truly mine to pray and study the Bible without a sermon in mind, to spend time with my12:48family. Life became simpler. And in that simplicity, the longing for the rapture12:53ceased to be a theological concept and became a daily reality. This was the first stage of my purification. the13:00painful amputation of a part of my life that had been corrupted had to die to my old identity in order to live in the13:07truth that had been revealed to me. This was just the beginning. Time passed and life without the pulpit platform settled13:14into a new normal. I found a modest job in a warehouse, something that in my previous life as a pastor I would have13:22considered beneath my calling. The hands I once raised to anoint the sick now carried boxes. my voice filling13:29auditoriums. Now it was only used to say good morning to my colleagues or to ask13:34for a tool. New colleagues they didn't know that I had been a pastor of a congregation of hundreds of people. To13:40them I was Luke the new kid in the store and most of the time that invisibility13:46brought me a strange and blessed peace. However, the Holy Spirit hadn't finished his work of purification. I naively13:53believed that by resigning from the past and status. I had uprooted the love of the world. But I thought that without a14:00platform, vain glory would no longer have a place to hide. But deception is subtle, and the enemy doesn't give up so14:08easily. My new test didn't come in the form of temptation for money or fame,14:13but in something much more insidious, spiritual pride. One afternoon, one of14:18my colleagues, a man named Carlos, approached me during a break. He had14:23noticed that I didn't join in the frivolous conversations or gossip at work. Out of curiosity, he asked me14:30about my faith. I spoke to him about Christ with a simplicity that surprised me. I shared my testimony without14:37mentioning that I had been a pastor. Carlos was deeply moved with his eyes tearfully. He told me he had been14:44searching for something like this for a long time. It was a genuine moment. And deep down in my heart, I felt pure14:52satisfaction. But after it was gone, the satisfaction went arry. I heard myself14:57thinking, ""See, Luke, God is still using you. Even here in this humble place, you15:03are doing his work. This is true holiness, not the manufactured holiness of the church. This is what it means to15:10truly follow Christ without applause or recognition. Today I realized that my15:15heart had taken the humility of my new situation and turned it into a new form of vain glory. I was proud of my15:22renunciation, proud of being different, proud of my sacrifice. The platform was15:28gone, but the desire to be seen and recognized. Even if it was for myself, it was still there. It was then that the15:35voice of the Holy Spirit returned, not with a dramatic revelation, but with a gentle rebuke. Luke, the love of the15:42world is not just the desire to have. It is the desire to be, to be seen, to be15:48recognized. And vain glory is the idol you worship in the darkness of your heart. Even after renouncing the15:55platform, you keep building a platform in your mind in which you are the protagonist of your own sacrifice. Your16:02sacrifice is not to glorify yourself but me. It took my breath away. I realized16:08that the purity of heart needed for the rapture is not just the absence of material attachments but the total16:14absence of a self-inflated by pride. My fight was not against the outside world16:19but against the little king who still lived in my heart. The one who felt special for having left the ministry.16:25The one who secretly thought his humility was greater than that of others. True detachment was not just16:31leaving the platform, but ceasing to seek satisfaction in any form of recognition, whether from a crowd or an16:38internal thought. The lesson was deeper than I had imagined. A heart ready for the rapture is a heart that is not16:44anchored to anything, not even its own history of sacrifice. How could a soul be raptured to heaven if it was still16:51tied to earth by the invisible thread of pride? This was the second stage of my16:56purification. The revelation of an inner battle I didn't even know was going on. Freeing the voice of the spirit had17:03stripped me of my status. But now I was stripping myself of my ego and the next17:08lesson would be even harder to accept. I thought that after the lesson on spiritual pride, my heart was finally a17:15blank canvas. I had let go of the platform, the status, and what I believed was the sanctity of my own17:22sacrifice. I felt vulnerable but at the same time free. My hours in the17:28warehouse were a meditation and my nights with the Bible had become an intimate agenda-free dialogue. I believe17:34that the purification of the Holy Spirit had come to an end, at least in that naive phase of me. There was one last17:42idol, much more subtle and deeprooted than money or fame that still clung to my heart. The love for my own theology,17:50the revelation didn't come about obvious sin. It came about a doctrine. As a pastor, I had built my faith on a17:57scaffold of firm beliefs. And in my pride, I thought that scaffolding was unshakable. I had dedicated myself to18:04studying, debating, and defending certain theological points with a passion that I believed was for the18:10God's truth, but the Holy Spirit in his infinite mercy was about to show me that even our most precious truth can become18:17an idol if we love it more than the potter's voice. One night while I was reading scripture, the spirit led me to18:24a passage I had always interpreted in a very specific way. And suddenly the18:29voice I already knew whispered to me, ""Luke, what if this truth you believe so strongly is not exactly as you have18:36preached it? What if you have embraced it out of convenience, tradition, or because it gives you a sense of18:42intellectual security? I felt the ground give way beneath my feet. The doctrine18:48in question was not central to salvation, but it was a cornerstone of how I understood the end times. And18:54therefore, the urgency of the rapture had taught that position with complete authority. I had written about it, used19:01it to correct other pastors, and now the spirit was asking me to revisit it, not to discard it, but to open myself to the19:08possibility that my understanding was limited, human, and most terrifying of all, selfish. The pride of my intellect19:16rose up in fury. I didn't cry out in my heart. This is what I've studied. This19:22is what the Bible says. This is what gives me coherence. I can't let this go.19:27It was the fear of not having the answer, of not being the expert I had been. It was the fear of uncertainty. It19:34was the love of my own reason and my own interpretation which I had built over years of study. And the spirit made me19:40see that this love for my correct theology was as worldly as the love of fame or money. It was the pride of life19:46manifested in my mind, not in my wallet. I realized that my faith was not in the19:52living God, but in my understanding of him. I had placed my trust in the solidity of my theological system, not19:59in the sovereignty of his voice. I had clung to the tradition of the men I myself had adopted and refused to be20:05malleable in their hands. The rapture will not be for those with perfect knowledge, but for those with a perfect20:11heart, completely surrendered and willing to let the potter shape it into whatever form he wants, even if that20:18form defies every belief we have built. I spent days in a mental and spiritual20:23turmoil, dismantling my own doctrine, reviewing each verse with the humility20:28of a child, not with the authority of a theologian. In that deconstruction, I20:33found a freedom I had never known. The truth was not something I possessed, but a being I followed. The Holy Spirit was20:40not only the comforter, but the creator of a new understanding, an understanding not based on the security of a doctrine,20:48but on complete trust in its guidance. I realized that true detachment is not20:53just letting go of the things of the world, but ceasing to seek security in anything other than God himself. We21:00cannot take our reputation, our money, our home, and we cannot take our theology with us. The only luggage21:06allowed in the rapture is a heart that is not anchored to anything on this earth, not even to the ideas we have21:13held sacred. The letting go of my theology was a painful but liberating process. It was like letting go of the21:19reigns of a wild horse that I had been trying to control with my intellect and simply trusting the rider. I realized21:26that faith is not a belief system that I control, but a relationship that it directs. I thought that was the last21:33tether, the last piece of my old self that needed to die. But the Holy Spirit,21:38in his infinite and persistent work of purification, had one more lesson, the21:43hardest of all, the one closest to my heart. The revelation came one afternoon21:48while I was playing in the yard with my two children. My oldest son, David, age21:54six, asked me an innocent question. Daddy, when is Jesus coming for us? I21:59responded with the same passion as always, speaking of the rapture, the promises of the scriptures, but as I22:06spoke, my heart filled with an overwhelming emotion. It wasn't the joy of Christ's coming, but fear. The fear22:13of what would happen if I was the only one taken away. The fear of leaving my family behind. the fear that my children22:20whom I loved so much would be left behind. I realized that my faith in the rapture wasn't a pure selfless hope. It22:28was conditioned by my deep emotional attachment to my family, the rapture was a beautiful promise. As long as all my22:35loved ones were on the same journey, but what if I didn't? The thought of my wife, Anna, or my children not making it22:42was a terror that paralyzed my faith. At that moment, the voice of the Holy Spirit returned, not with a reproach,22:49but with a gentle and devastating question. Luke, do you love your family more than me? Is your desire for them to22:56go up a manifestation of love for me? Or is it a selfish desire to not experience23:02the pain of loss? This question tore me apart. It made me see a truth I had23:07refused to acknowledge, my love for my family. The purest and holiest thing I23:12believed I had had become a subtle idol. It was an emotional anchor that kept me23:18grounded. It's not that loving my family was bad. On the contrary, it's a command23:23from God. But my love had been corrupted. It had become a possession. The desire to protect them from losing23:30them. It was a form of human control, not divine trust. I was placing my23:35security and peace in the presence of my family and not in the sovereignty of God. The Holy Spirit revealed to me that23:42a heart that is not willing to let go of everything, even the most precious things in this life, is not ready for23:48the rapture. He showed me that true faith in the coming of Christ is not just a hope, but a total surrender. It23:55is being willing to let go of everything, even those we love the most, and trust fully that God is good enough24:01to take care of them, whether here or in eternity. The lesson was not to stop24:06loving my family, but to reorder my loves, to place God in the first place without conditions. I had to go to my24:13room, kneel, and cry. Not out of fear of loss, but out of shame for having given24:19my family a place in my heart that belonged only to him. In that surrender, I said to God, ""Father, I trust in you.24:27If on that glorious day I ascend and they stay, may your will be done. I'm yours and so are they. My only hope and24:34my only security is that you are enough. No matter who is at my side, it was the hardest prayer of my life. But in it, I24:42felt the last and heaviest of my anchors come loose. Now when I look at my children, my love for them is purer and24:49freer. It is not burdened by fear, but by the hope that as I live a completely surrendered life, they too will be24:56touched by the grace that is transforming me. And in the longing for the rapture, there are now no25:01conditions. There is a pure and simple joy for the coming of the king. No matter who is or isn't at my side, send25:08this was my last great lesson. The purification of the heart that prepared me for the true weight. After releasing25:15the last tie to my family, I experienced a peace that transcended all understanding. It was the peace of a man25:21who no longer had anything to lose because his only possession was Christ. My love for Anna and my children became25:28purer and deeper, free from fear and possession. I saw them not as mine, but as precious gifts from God entrusted to25:35my care. My prayer for them was no longer for them to come up with me, but for them to know the Christ I had. I25:42rediscovered in the humility of my own purification. This new perspective completely transformed my daily life.25:50The problems at work, the financial worries, the small frictions of family life were all seen through a different25:56lens. The ambition to move up in the store or earn more money simply vanished. Not because I was lazy, but26:03because my true goal was no longer on this earth. My free time, previously consumed by the cares of a ministry or26:10trying to impress my family, was now dedicated to to a genuine communion with God and to serve my family in the26:17simplest things. My wife, Anna, was the first to notice the change. I was no26:22longer the tense and worried Lucas, burdened by the expectations of a ministry. Now I was a free man with a26:29calm that radiated from within. I sat down to read the Bible with her and the children, not as a teacher who had all26:36the answers, but as a traveling companion who, like them, was learning to trust. The sermons that came out of26:43my mouth in those moments were not grand theological discourses, but rather humble stories of my own struggle and of26:50God's faithfulness in the midst of my failure. It was in that simplicity that their hearts began to open in ways they26:57never had when I was a successful pastor. The Holy Spirit showed me that true preparation for the rapture is not27:03just a renunciation of the things of the world, but a radical change in the way we live in the world. It showed me that27:09the church in its eagerness to be relevant had forgotten that its greatest influence is not in major events but in27:16the daily lives of its people. Members holiness is not what happens in the pull pit but what happens in the storoom, in27:24the kitchen, in conversation with a neighbor. It is in those moments that our lack of attachment to the things of27:30this life becomes evident. It was in this new stage of this ordinary life that the spirit gave me a new and27:37specific assignment. Not a ministry with lights and cameras, but a call to be a27:42silent witness to live this truth of detachment in such a visible way that others would ask themselves the question27:49I had asked myself. Conclusion. How can we be ready for the rapture if we are so27:55anchored to the earth? I had to live my life in such a way that my peace, my freedom, and my lack of anxiety would28:02become the most powerful message I could preach. And that is how my testimony became the work of my hands. The love I28:09gave my wife and the patience I had with my children. It became the way my life28:14once so complicated and full of expectations was simplified to reflect the only truth that matters, the28:21imminent coming of our king. My mission was no longer to build a kingdom on earth, but to prepare for the kingdom28:27that is to come and with my life, to show others the way. My new life as a silent witness was soon often tested.28:34The Holy Spirit reminded me that true holiness is not hidden in a monastery, but shines among people, in the most28:41unexpected places, and it was precisely in one of those places, in the aisle of a supermarket, where I met the first28:48person who saw me not as a failure, but as an enigma. It was a Saturday morning. I was pushing my cart with my shopping28:55list in my hand and my mind on the horizon. Focused on the prices and29:00brands my children preferred in the dairy section. I looked up and met David's eyes. One of the elders from my29:07old church was the same man who, with a mixture of pity and bewilderment, had asked me if I needed a vacation. David's29:15first reaction was one of surprise. A stiffening of his posture revealed palpable discomfort. I felt no shame or29:22resentment, only a strange and profound peace. I approached him with a genuine smile. David, how nice to see you. How29:30are you and your family? His response was a little tense, full of questions about my new job and whether I had found29:37another church. No. His eyes, however, weren't just looking for answers, but29:43something more. They were scanning my face, my clothes, my shopping cart, as29:48if looking for clues about the misery he and others assumed I was experiencing. David told me about the church, about29:55the new pastor, and about the challenges they were facing amidst his words. In30:01the way he spoke of growth and expansion plans, I saw in him the same attachment30:06to the world I had felt. He worried about the number of people, the ministry's reputation, and the programs.30:13But the passion for souls, that passion that had once united us felt absent. No,30:19I didn't judge him. I just listened and prayed for him in my heart. When I said goodbye, I wished him the best with a30:26sincerity that seemed to surprise him. I didn't give him a sermon. I didn't tell him he was wrong. I didn't share my30:32revelation with him. I simply showed him a piece he hadn't expected to see, a piece that didn't come from having a30:39successful ministry, but from something much deeper. His face reflected a confusion I knew well. My silence and my30:46peace were a sermon more powerful than any I had given from the pull pit. That encounter was only the first of many. At30:53the gas station, I ran into a couple I had married at my children's school. I met with a leader of the women's30:59ministry. At each encounter, the reaction was the same surprise, discomfort, questions. And at each31:06encounter, my response was the same. Genuine peace and kindness without agendas. People expected to see me31:13broken, resentful, repentant. But what they saw was a free man. The Holy Spirit31:19was using me in ways I never imagined. Not through my eloquence, but through my stillness, not through my reputation,31:26but through my invisibility. He was teaching me that true influence is not bored with platforms, but rather earned31:33with a purified heart. The people from my former church who had distanced themselves from me when I left the31:39pastor. Now I was closer to my testimony than ever. My life, my simplicity, my31:46contentment amidst my anonymity had become a mirror for them. And in that mirror, they were beginning to see31:52something terrifying. the possibility that their own faith, their own service was anchored in the things of the world.31:59My hands that carried boxes, my voice that didn't preach sermons, my peace32:04that didn't depend on circumstances were planting a seed of doubt, a seed that made them wonder if the rapture would32:10come at the end of the day for those who loved the king or for those who loved the kingdoms they had built in his name.32:16And that doubt was the beginning of a path I knew well. The effect of my peace on others wasn't always a simple32:22surprise. Sometimes my calmness was perceived as an accusation. It became a32:28mirror that showed them not only their own shackles, but also their deep fear of letting go. The first direct32:34confrontation came not from an old man in a supermarket, but from my best friend Marcos, a man whom I had met in32:41seminary and with whom I had dreamed in our youth, conquer the world for Christ. Marcos was now a pastor of a mega church32:48in the city. He had a television show. He wrote books. And his ministry was the32:53envy of many. Anna, he stopped by my house unannounced. One Saturday32:58afternoon, it wasn't a casual visit. His face was tense, and the smile he tried33:03to force didn't reach his eyes. Anna, my wife, served him coffee and discreetly33:08withdrew. Feeling the heaviness in the air. I knew this wasn't a courtesy visit. Marcos got straight to the point.33:15Lucas, I've heard the rumors. I've run into several from your former congregation. You don't seem like33:22yourself. It seems the enemy has blinded you and made you renounce your calling. It hurts me to see you like this,33:29brother."" His tone was condescending, layered with a concern that deep down I33:34felt it was for him, not for me. He didn't see a friend at peace, but a33:39colleague who had defected to a broken link in the chain of ministerial success that he valued so much. I listened to33:46him in silence letting the calm of the Holy Spirit wash over me. He told me about the harvest of the responsibility33:53of the platform of the urgency of evangelism. Yes.

I finally decided to test drive one, the Smart EQ ForTwo, and it was a total game-changer. The first thing I noticed was how ridiculously easy it was to park. I could slip into spaces I used to pass by without even trying. Charging it at home overnight cost less than a single cup of coffee, and even though the range wasn’t huge, it easily covered my daily trips. 

After doing a bit of research, I found that a lot of people swear by the Wuling Hongguang Mini EV for value, especially in parts of Asia, while the Renault Twizy seems to dominate in Europe. Personally, I think the sweet spot is finding something with just enough range for your needs without paying for extra mileage you won’t use. What surprised me was discovering that importing isn’t as scary as it sounds. I saw some amazing deals on Alibaba for models that aren’t even sold locally. Owning a small EV has made my daily commute cheaper, quieter, and way more fun, and I can’t imagine going back to my old gas guzzler.

**\[INT. STARS HOLLOW – NIGHT – LUKE’S DINER\]**

*It’s dark inside the diner. The chairs are up, lights off, and Luke is alone behind the counter staring aimlessly and slowly wiping the same spot on the counter over and over. He looks tired. A knock at the glass startles him. It’s Lorelai. Her hair is damp, she's holding her sweater in one hand. She looks equal parts heartbroken and determined.*

**LUKE**  
Didn’t expect to see you again tonight.

**LORELAI**  
Yeah, well... turns out, walking away in the rain doesn’t feel as good as it does in the movies. I mean, unless you're Rachel McAdams in *The Notebook*.

**LUKE**  
Where did you go?

**LORELAI**  
Nowhere. I walked. That’s it. I just walked around town... and ended up right back here.

*Beat.*

**LORELAI**  
I can’t keep doing this, Luke. This waiting, this limbo. It’s like we’re stuck in a *Lost* subplot that doesn’t make sense anymore.

**LUKE**  
Yeah. I know.

*He takes a breath, moves toward her.*

**LUKE**  
Let’s get married. Tonight. You and me. No big ceremony, no craziness. Just us.

**LORELAI**  
Luke...

*She blinks, eyes misting. Her voice steadies.*

**LORELAI**  
If we do this, we do it all the way. No hesitation. No looking back. No running when things get messy - because they will get messy. I mean, they already are messy with April and Anna - but I want to be in this mess with you and I need to know you’re really in this with me. Not just tonight. Every night, Luke.

*Luke steps forward, close, steady.*

**LUKE**  
Lorelai, I’m all in.

*She lets out a shaky breath, a smile flickering through tears.*

**LORELAI**  
Okay. Then let’s do it.

**\[EXT. STARS HOLLOW – GAZEBO – LATER THAT NIGHT\]**

*The gazebo is lit up by twinkling lights. There are some instruments strewn about from the troubadours that played there earlier in the evening. Kirk, wearing a crooked tie and holding a stack of official-looking papers, stands at the center like he’s officiated dozens of ceremonies. He hasn’t.*

**KIRK**  
By the power invested in me by the Universal Church of Cosmic Harmony and a very fast online certification - I now pronounce you ready for your vows. Which I will now supervise.

*Lorelai holds a small bouquet of flowers she plucked from a nearby garden. She looks at Luke, serious and glowing.*

**LORELAI**  
Luke... I’ve had relationships, heartbreaks, Hallmark moments, and Nicholas Sparks-level disasters. But the truth is - my life meant nothing until you use my toothbrush.

*She smirks, Luke smiles, remembering he said that before.*

I never really loved anyone until I loved you. Not completely. Not in that terrifying, grounding, “you see me even when I don’t want to be seen” kind of way.

You are my safe place. My reality check when I’m spiraling over takeout menus or Friday night dinners. I promise to be your partner - your equal. I promise I will absolutely drive you crazy sometimes - talk too much, rearrange the fridge, put the coupons in the coffee can instead of the drawer - but I will also love you with everything I’ve got. No matter what. No matter when. I’m all in, forever.

*Luke gives her a soft smile. Then it’s his turn.*

**LUKE**  
I promise to make you coffee in the morning, to pick up the slack when you’re overwhelmed, to wait for the cable guy when you forget, or for the fridge guy. I will go with your bits, even when they make absolutely no sense to me. I promise to stay in it with you and love you, for good.

*Kirk clears his throat, getting choked up.*

**KIRK**  
That was... beautiful. I haven’t been this touched since I saw *March of the Penguins.*

*They laugh. Luke and Lorelai kiss as Kirk pronounces them husband and wife. Kirk takes their picture. The Polaroid camera flashes, catching their imperfect, perfect beginning.*",0,1754942321.0,GilmoreGirls,0,0.29,False

Honestly, sometimes I wonder if this whole earning-money-on-the-internet thing is like a secret club and I keep knocking at the wrong door. The possibilities are thrown at us constantly:  
- Dropshipping  
- Print-on-demand  
- Digital marketing  
- Shiny, mysterious “side hustles” that sound cooler than my actual job

BUUUT HOOOW?!?

One second, I’m reading someone’s story about how they made $10,000 in a weekend. Next second, I can’t even get anyone to buy my old sneakers on a local app. Did I miss a step? Was there, like, a money door that closed before I could say “password please!”? 😅

I stumbled on this list of inspirational stories on https://goodnovel.org/ and wow, it’s like every main character is either falling in love or making millions…sometimes at the same time. Am I supposed to write a novel about my socks now? If so, where’s my six figures?

Let’s break it down:  
- Does anyone actually earn a full-time income just by doing “fun” things online?  
- What are the LEGIT ways you’ve *actually seen* (and/or done yourself)?  
- Is it all “get rich quick” gaslighting or are some of these paths real?

I got super hyped at one point and made a bunch of digital art prints. Set up an Etsy. Realized I forgot to set the “free shipping” so lost money—even though I SOLD ONE.

Is it about luck? Magic? Manifesting? Connections? Or just figuring out which *niche* fits you best?

I mean, there are literally people who tell stories for a living—no, not just authors—actual TikTokers reciting Reddit posts for money?!?

I just want to know:  
- What little daily things (or big leaps) did successful online earners actually DO?  
- How much patience is necessary?  
- Where’s the line between “investing in yourself” and just lighting money on fire?

Sometimes I think maybe I should read more success stories for motivation (https://goodnovel.org/ is stacking those “my life changed overnight” stories high enough for a staircase 🤑), and sometimes I think I’ll just…play video games and hope someone drops cash in my coffee fund “just because.”

AND what about honesty? All these “easy” wins, but then you read the comments and half say it’s a scam, half say it’s the best money ever—and I’m sitting here more confused than when I started.

If you’ve actually figured out earning money online, PLEASE drop your story. Short version, epic version, whatever you want. Give us hope! Give us bullet points! Or just commiserate while I scroll https://goodnovel.org/ for life hacks until my phone battery dies.

Then a hot black plate to keep the meat warm. Then BOOM .. first wave hits: chicken liver, ox balls (yes, *actual* balls), pork sausage, beef steak, rump steak… and they’re recommending sauce pairings like they’re wine sommeliers.

They explain the “flag system”, flag up means “send more troops,” flag down means “ceasefire,” flag removed means “I surrender.” Five minutes in, my flag is flying high and the meat storm intensifies: leg of lamb, chicken yakitori, chicken wings, leg of pork, pork ribs, pork sausages… I take a break, stop filming, start questioning my stamina.

Then I hear: “Crocodile. Ostrich.” My brain says “no,” my heart says “yes.” I keep going. Then beef ribs, turkey. At this point I’m chewing on autopilot, fighting for my life, lowkey praying for a bathroom break.

They said I could order as much as I want, including the exotic meats.. ostrich, crocodile, turkey etc  
But boy oh boy was my flag down!! hehe.

Finished with coffee and crème brûlée for dessert, staring into the middle distance wondering if I had just survived or lost a war. Would I do it again? Absolutely. Once my bank account recovers.

1mnnc1c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mnnc1c,My hardcover CLAMP Color Gold Artbook arrived from Japan!,"It’s the hardcover version of the Kuro and Shiro art books. Very pretty coffee-table book, with lots of gold details. 

The art inside is the same as the other books and a few black and white pages of the manga. 

Got it from Tokyo Otaku Mode from Japan, but honestly wish I would have waited to get this instead of the separate kuro and shiro versions previously. Also there’s so little text so I’m wondering what’s going to be the difference between the U.S. printings.

I’m looking for other players in the **12k–20k Premier rating range** who actually want to improve, play structured CS, and treat the game with intention — but without the ego, tilt, or toxicity that usually comes with it.

# What I’m looking for:

* People to queue **Premier or Faceit** with from **North America**, ideally **Central U.S.** based for better ping and scheduling.
* Players who are competitive but grounded — no raging, no toxicity, no ego
* Open to feedback, team-focused, and actively trying to improve.
* **No tolerance for racism, toxicity, or edgy behavior.** Just be a decent human being.
* Preferably other **25+** players, or anyone with a mature and respectful mindset.
* **Premier rating somewhere in the 12k–20k range** — not hard limits, just looking for players in that general tier.

# What I bring:

* Calm, communicative teammate who plays to win but keeps things constructive.
* Willing to review demos, practice, and improve long-term.
* Focused during rounds, relaxed between them.

Bonus:

* Spend way too much time obsessing over peripherals
* Love coffee, tea and the occasional adult beverage
* Could talk way too much about cars, motorcycles or anything engineering related.

I am on day 6, despitetraditionally being told to wait 3 weeks before you can notice the effects.

From my research online, it appears to release(or inhibit reuptake) dopamine and noreadrenaline on day 1, and the full effects from BDNF only start much later.

It guarantees me to have a day of improved mood and energy. However, sometimes i find it just a little bit too activating for something on a daily basis. It could be because my base NOREadrenaline must be already high.

I think wellbutrin would be a great tool for me to have, to use on days where i feel lethargic, and want to feel activated. But i'm not sure it would be right for me to take on a daily basis.

I was given Wellbutrin because i complained of severe distractibility, along with irritability, decreased motivation and joy.

I have asked my DR and pharmacists, and they say it's okay to start or discontinue this format without taper, so my thinking is that it would be okay to take ""as-needed"" Even if it flies in the face of conventional medical wisdom.

1mnn5fi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1mnn5fi/i_dont_believe_substance_abuse_disorder_can_be/,I don't believe substance abuse disorder can be cured,"First off, sorry for the vent. It may come across as rude or insensitive and I'm not usually either of these things but EVERYTHING in my past has led me to believe this and I've really got to get this off my chest. Again, I'm sorry. Please feel free to tell me any personal and REAL recovery stories. Maybe it will change my view (God I'm hoping).

My Dad was a substance abuser all his life since very young teens. I'm not talking about addiction to one drug. I mean, ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. Cigarettes (30 a day), alcohol (black out every night), sugar (literally all he would eat), caffeine (wouldn't drink water. When thirsty, drank tea/coffee). Before he died in Dec last year, he had got into butane cannisters a few years back which eventually killed him but not before wrecking his entire body and mind until he was a sad, gasping, dishevelled zombie. And still, he continued. 

My Dad was not a bad guy.  He was musical and hilarious and everyone loved him (until he had a drink). He and my mum end up pregnant by some miracle even though he was told he'd never have kids because of his drinking. They were supposed to be soulmates. Known eachother since they were 3 and 4 and, though my mum split with him because of all of this, they NEVER stopped loving eachother. My mum always said, even at the end that he was her soulmate.

HOW could it be that he couldn't just stop for his soulmate and the love of his brand new baby girl? I don't get it? Wouldn't you do anything for your child? He always told me he would do anything for me. He then went to rehab when I was 4. That did fuck all. Then he gets hooked on the gas and I try so hard to help him oh my God. He even said he WANTED HELP! I quit uni to live with him and try to help fight it and he would lie and lie and lie like he had done his whole life. ""No, I've  not got anything!"" ""I've not used gas since last week!"" Meanwhile, I'm finding his stashes all over his bedroom because he was so shite at hiding them. Always asking me for money to buy milk and bread when we all knew what it was really for. I could never say no.

In those last years, especially towards the end he'd say, ""I'd do anything for my health back."" WHAT?????? THEN STOP USING DRUGS!!!! I hate to admit we all gave up. He lied and lied and I was fed up. My Mum had ""moved on"" (not really) and was adamant on believing him when he told her he didnt do gas anymore. Meanwhile, I moved away as I was mentally going downhill living with him and watched him slowly shrivel away into nothingness with nobody; just waiting to die. He had no muscle mass, tremors from the brain damage, nerve damage so bad he'd lost feeling in his arms and legs. bleeding from the nose, chronic kidney failure and he MUST have known why. He MUST have. He'd phone us and say he was so proud that he hadn't touched alcohol in over a year. That was true, but every night he was doing gas. He knew how bad it was on his body because I had gone through it with him so many times. Never shouted or screamed or belittled. I was understanding. I told him I would help in any way we can and I understand it's a disease and it's so so hard for him but if he keeps this up HE WILL DIE. I asked if he was doing this because he wanted to die and he said no. Still, it never changed. He'd just lie more. 

I am outraged when I watch videos of him at 23, 3 years younger than me, and he's singing and playing the guitar. He was talented and likeable. That poor boy never deserved a life like that. My Mum never deserved to love a man so deeply who was like that and thus I should never have even been born. How a person could have a baby with a man like that is questionable at best. 

Aside from my Dad, I'm now seeing it in my partners brother. He's only 19 and has already stooped so low to extract alcohol from hand sanitizer after they cleared the house of alcohol. These types of substance abusers are not just addicts. They aren't content unless the drug completely obliterates them. There's never enough and never too much. The consequences don't matter and the lies never ever stop. My partner has hope for his brother. I wish I could have that too but I can't. I see his path, it might even be worse than my Dad's. I think I hate him. Every time I see him, I'm reminded of the worst parts of my childhood and all the lies. The lie of ""I'd do anything for you and your mum."" The lie of ""I'd do anything for my health back."" The lie of ""I do want to change,"" or ""I do want help.""

In the end, never have I ever heard of someone with substance use disorder overcoming it. I pray to whatever sick twat is out there that something changes my mind. I really do",1,1754941752.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

1mnn3on,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1mnn3on/soft_serve_in_nyc/,Soft serve in NYC,"Ok finally getting around to the state of soft serve in NYC/rounding up my favorites. Ice cream, sorbet, whatever else - I’ll eat it. Froyo is its own thing though so none of that here.

These are my favorite places and flavors to get at each - note that at many of the smaller spots, flavors rotate and might be different now:

**Manhattan:**

* Soft Swerve - they’ve gone downhill at some locations in particular but the ube remains pretty consistent. I really need them to bring back the pineapple soft serve they did one summer. Multiple locations in Queens and Brooklyn as well
* Manousheh Grand - Ashta soft serve. Why aren't we talking about this more?
* Milu - Dole whip soft serve
* Cha-An Bonbon - hojicha soft serve
* Morgenstern's - cherry and milk soft serve (though they are always mean here)
* Stick With Me - almond hazelnut praline joy and dark chocolate swirl
* Mijo - this is Fany Gerson’s taco spot in Pier 57 but the vanilla soft serve with rainbow sprinkles hits so hard
* Taiyaki NYC - vanilla and strawberry soft serve with cotton candy sprinkles. Location in Brooklyn as well
* Mister Dips - Lickety Split, Chocolate P.B.D., Berry Gibbs, After Eight, truly anything here. RIP to the neat Brooklyn airstream loc but this one is perfect before a show at Pier 17
* Surreal Creamery - taro/matcha swirl but for the love of god don't go to the MacDougal one, worst basement smell ever
* El Vez Burrito Bar - chocolate and horchata
* Dominique Ansel - What-a-Melon; this is the second best watermelon flavor in NYC after Dolly’s
* Kolkata Chai - chai soft serve rules. Also in Brooklyn
* Supermoon Bakehouse - been a minute but I loved the croissant and ferrero rocher flavs in 2018
* Dudley’s Deli Window - Koala crackle sundae nommm
* Big Gay Ice Cream Shop - Mermaid and Salty Pimp were great back in the day. I have not been in years so idk how it is now

**Queens:**

* Taku Parlor - they rotate matcha and hojicha (believe it’s back to matcha right now)
* Somedays Bakery - vanilla soft serve pairs very nicely with their choc cake. Also liked the pistachio
* Matcha Cafe Maiko - black sesame is fantastic. They also do matcha and ube. In Manhattan as well, but I’m putting it under Queens because the Tangram location is less hectic and also I wanted to fill out the Queens section lmao
* Comfortland - Dole whip - they also did funfetti peanut butter choc and some other flavors and dipped cones a few years ago afkjhdskjfh
* Spring Shabu-Shabu - self-serve matcha and vanilla machine goes crazy

**Brooklyn:**

* Dolly’s Coffee Shop - the watermelon is sooo good. Tastes like a watermelon Sour Patch gummy. Best watermelon soft serve in NYC
* L'Industrie - cantaloupe sorbetto swirled with yogurt gelato and cherry sauce actually cured me
* Malai - my fave pistachio soft serve in the city. The saffron is good too but the pistachio is the one I always go back for
* OddFellows - another great pistachio soft serve option if you’re in Dumbo. One time they had a summer carnival pop-up at Chef's Club in SoHo (RIP) and did a creamsicle soft serve with tangerine cotton candy that I think about all the time. Their coffee and pumpkin flavors are also amazing 
* Kettl - matcha soft serve
* Guevara's - cream and guava soft serve (vegan)

**Restaurant versions:**

* Leo - mascarpone and black cherry!!!
* Rule of Thirds - habanada pepper flavor is wild
* Potluck Club - pineapple soft serve
* Momofuku Noodle Bar - Vietnamese iced coffee soft serve rules, also love the cheesecake flavor. Had both at the uptown loc
* Lilia - Italian Job. Also available at Lilia Caffé
* Shukette - tahini chocolate swirl soft serve
* Stretch Pizza - vanilla soft serve with cinnamon oat crumble and caramel sauce

**Honorable mentions (good but not great):**

* Orchard Grocer - peppermint vanilla (vegan)
* Sweet Churros - the taro is solid but the Fruity Pebbles churro really sends it home
* Ray's Candy Store - vanilla/chocolate swirl
* The Screen Door - vanilla
* Takahachi Bakery - ube soft serve is solid, but I prefer Soft Swerve's
* Haidilao - peach/papaya and vanilla soft serve is fine. but it’s included/you’re not here for that anyway
* COTE - vanilla with soy sauce dulce de leche is good

**Tried but didn’t love:**

* Caffe Panna - it’s too thick/creamy for me. I always opt for their granita instead (Brooklyn loc)
* Bear Donut - lavender soft serve looked beautiful but tasted eh
* Morgenstern's BANANAS - I hate this place so much. Bring back the OG concept please
* Laser Wolf - I know I’ve had the soft serve here but truly no memory of it
* Softside - The quality is simply not there imo
* KITH Treats - Milk & Cream had the better cereal milk ice cream and also having to wait in the line to get in the store is garbage
* Milk Bar - ditto (idk if they even have it anymore?)

**On my list to try:**

* Bird & Branch at Pier 57 (Fri/Sat/Sun only). They’ve been doing black sesame and hojicha!
* See No Evil Pizza - they didn’t have it when I went, anyone know if they’re still doing it?
* Librae (Fri/Sat/Sun only)
* Hani’s (Fri/Sat evenings only which is so annoying I may never go)
* Seed + Mill - I don’t love tahini but I’ve been told this will change my mind - I did like the one at Shukette so will try it
* Glace by noglu - good or just instagram bait?
* Nana's Green Tea - I had it in Seattle once and thought it was meh but will try again here
* Sugar Hill Creamery - vegan, only at East Harlem loc
* Fan Fan Doughnuts

**RIP:**

* Mah-Ze-Dahr Bakery used to do chocolate and mint and the luxe toppings and homemade waffle cone were also amazing ugh
* Keki Modern Cakes - ube/vanilla was great. ofc they still have cheesecakes which is what they’re better at anyway
* Milk & Cream Cereal Bar - the cookie crisp carnival
* Domonique Ansel Kitchen - burrata and chocolate hazelnut swirl ice cream with balsamic and caramel was so good but we do not miss the weird stadium-style seating in there
* Made Nice - sundaes
* Besfren - a good midtown option for ube/matcha
* Dessert Club by ChikaLicious... the churro cone
* Paper Plate - the dips were so good

We had a small and beautiful wedding with 20 guests.

I’ve known Janet (50F) for over 20 years. Something like a decade ago, Janet married Thor (M50s), and we attended their wedding, which was a lovely backyard affair. Over the years, we’ve been to their home for Easter and Christmas dinners many times.

It seemed like a no-brainer to ask Janet to be my witness.

Thor is a retired ex-military veteran who fought in Afghanistan. He is LOUD. His normal talking volume is the equivalent of someone else shouting. I don’t know if it’s due to hearing damage from his service or if that’s just his personality, but it’s noticeable.

I've never had trouble with the guy as far as I know, and we were always friendly with one another. I once 3D-printed him a puzzle piece after one of his dogs ate it. 

As the ceremony was starting, I was walking to my spot for the vows. Thor and Janet were seated in the front row. As I passed Thor, he suddenly shouted, “How high are you? How many drugs are you on?” The commissioner was standing right behind him while he was shouting; I even have photos of this time and space.  (He was so loud that my parents later asked me, “What was Janet’s husband talking about you being on drugs?”)

I hissed back, “I’m not. Shut up,” and kept walking.

The ceremony itself went smoothly, aside from me accidentally saying “Lisa” during the “I, OP, hereby declare…” part. Everyone laughed, it was nice moment during a serious event.

After the signing, guests were crowding around to congratulate me. Suddenly, Thor appeared in front of me again, shouting, “Are you in pain? 

Me: “Not the time or place, dude.” 

Thor: “How much pain are you in?”

Me: ” Not. The time. Or place.”

Janet’s mother, Marilyn, who was standing beside me, asked, “Oh, why is OP in pain?”

Thor loudly replied, “Because he has a hernia!”

Marilyn exclaimed, “Oh, I don’t want to hear about hernias!”, in a disgusted tone.

A few days later, I brought this to Janet’s attention, and told her:

- Thor’s shouting about me being “on drugs” wasn’t just disrespectful, it could have jeopardized the entire proceedings. The commissioner could have halted the ceremony if they believed someone wasn’t sober. 

- Thor’s shouting about my hernia was a complete betrayal of trust. My personal medical information is private, and certainly not something to announce to an entire wedding.

When I asked why he did these things, Janet’s explanation was that Thor’s ex-military background meant he had worked in a toxic environment and “can’t tell right from wrong anymore.” Then she said he was “just joking,” and that’s “the kind of humor military people have, like finding eyeballs floating in your coffee” (I have no idea what that’s in reference to, not sure if I want to know).  Finally, she said, “If you need any kind of support, feel free to reach out to us.”

So, my wife replied “If your offer of support is genuine, then you would ask Thor to apologize for his disrespectful behavior.”

Instead of apologizing, Janet sent my wife a long rant accusing me of having a mental illness, ending with “not to gaslight lol.”

My wife cried when she read it. 

One of my oldest friends made my wife cry.

Guess the offer wasn’t genuine.

The really confusing part is that they gave us an expensive Ninja Woodfire outdoor oven as a wedding gift. I have no idea why you’d buy someone something large and expense like that… and then try to humiliate them on their wedding day.

He’s my first boyfriend out of my 2 ex-girlfriends. We’re both same sex and had it at first meet, like yung “click” na sinasabi nila na kapag unang pagkikita nyo pa lang ramdam mo na agad na may patutunguhan yung flow ng kung ano mang nararamdaman nyo sa isa’t isa. That’s how I felt when i met my bf. It was my birthday pa. Long story short, we fell in love. He’s so hardworking. Caring sa akin. Family oriented. Always reassures me with his words of affirmations everyday. He never fell short of the partner standard. To the point na, we were just about to celebrate our first monthsary, inalok na nya agad ako na mag-stay sa bahay nila na inuupahan din dahil nag-woworry daw sya sa’kin sa apartment ko dahil i’m living solo there and we’re like 20-30km away. I doubt it at first dahil mejo getting to know each other pa lang kami but I got his mother’s cue and also agrees na “okay” lang daw mag stay ako sa house nila. So I moved out of my apartment, that was January 2025. They are a very close family. Nagkikita-kita silang magkakapatid almost every weekend to spend time with their parents sa house. Yung bf ko, pangatlo sa apat na magkakapatid. And since bumukod na yung dalawang nakatatanda nyang kapatid at may pamilya na, he’s almost the provider of the family dahil humina yung negosyo ni tita sa pagtitinda and tumigil naman si tito sa pagco-contractor. Dare I say, kahit nakikita kong nagkukulang sila, they always made sure kumakain ako tatlo beses isang araw and takes care of me like their child. So to cut the story short, from January to July, we were so into it. And dahil nga baliktad oras namin, dayshift sya and nightshift ako, and there were days na kailangan ko pa pumasok sa school ng umaga dahil working student, and every day off, umuuwi ako sa province namin sa kabilang city to stay with my family (dahil only child lang ako and lives with my grandparents, I can’t missed a week without seeing them) kaya madalang na lang kami nagkikita kahit nasa iisang bahay kami. But he always update me often—just like how I first replied to him the day we were just on dm’s and phone screens. We’re also active s*xually and socially. There were no excuse to cheat unless it’s made by choice.. My circle of friends know him, same thing he does with his friend group and colleagues sa work nya. Until some time in July, nakaramdam ako na parang he’s always fixated sa phone nya every morning. (I never suspected at first dahil he always check his gc sa work before matulog and kagising) but when he told me one morning “mauna ka na bumangon babe, init ka tubig pang coffee, stretch ko lang likod ko”, I was taken aback. That’s new to me. But i shrugged it off. Hanggang sa nag day-off na nga ako and kinailangang umuwi sa amin. 2 days ako mawawala sa bahay nila and 80km away, the usual routine, kaso hell week that time sa school kaya ang dami ko plans sa notes. May work naman sya that day. We always have a video call naman before mag-sleep when i’m away. But this was different. The 2nd day of my day off, I was flooded with notif sa account nya na hinahanap sya sa gc. That time kase sinanla nya yung phone nya dahil nagkulang yung pamayad nila ng renta sa bahay na later on ako rin yung tumubos so ang mode of communication lang namin is when he’s borrowing his phone sa younger brother nya sa house and at work may ka-close syang ka work na nahihirman nya ng phone to send me updates. That was around (March-June) na wala sya phone. So to continue, Bakit daw wala pa sya and almost an hour na sya late that day?? (**note: we agreed to make our social media accounts accessible to each other). Pabalik na ako that day ng Pampanga, from Tarlac. So i messaged his mother ano oras sya umalis, and tita immediately responded 6:00 am, 8:00am schedule nya. 8:48 na. Almost 3 hrs na syang MIA. THAT WAS ODD. That’s the start of suspicion. I never replied sa gc nila and yung 5:00pm na plano kong luwas pabalik, in-adjust ko ng 12:00pm para maabutan ko yung lunch nya ng 2-3pm dahil balak ko syang puntahan sa store. I don’t have contact with him dahil nga wala sya phone. And yes, around 3pm naabutan ko sya sa store and was only about to take his lunch dahil wala yung midshift nila. Sabay na kami kumain dahil hindi na ako nag-lunch sa tarlac, biyahe agad. While we were eating, I casually asked him bakit sya na-late and he replied calmly “sorry babe, nasiraan kasi yung jeep sa expressway ang tagal pa ng rescue na jeep para i-transfer kami”—ahhh. So that time nabunutan ako ng tinik sa dibdib. After kumain, pinauna na nya ako pero usually, kapag bumabalik ako ng Pampanga, sabay na kami umuuwi sa bahay nila and it’s wether I’ll wait for him or sya maghihintay sa akin. That day kase, NAG STRAIGHT DUTY SYA until 10PM. Which is true dahil kulang ng head count ang store nila (fast-food chain). So i waited for him to arrive home, around 11pm na ata sya nakauwi dahil bumiyahe pa, 30-45 mins ang biyahe from SM CITY CLARK to MAGALANG. Understandable pa right? He was so tired that day pero nagawa pa nya lambingin ako. We cuddle and ipinaglaba ko pa sya ng damit nya na susuotin kinabukasan. And he does his thing again that morning. Super bilis ng kamay nya. I pretended like i was sleeping pa but secretly peeking and when I accidentally moved, he was so alert and noticed me like he got doxxed or something but greeted me with a smile sabay paalam sa akin na gagala daw sila saglit ng mga ka-work nya na kasabay nya ng day off sa cdc the day ng monthsary namin. We were discussing. I still had no idea that time and because sabi nya saglit lang naman daw sila magbo-bonding, okay? I let the day went by and pumasok na sya. Kinagabihan may shift na ako and the morning na nag-out ako at nakauwi ng bahay, he’s still asleep, so i had the opportunity to get into his phone, all these cheating allegations in my head had to put to an end. Kinalkal ko yung messenger, wala. lahat ng socials, wala. And then boom. I checked his search history sa facebook, meron one name na 3 days na nyang everyday sinesearch, so out of curiousity, I searched the name on his account. It was public. They are friends pero wala sa messenger nya. I clicked the message to see if may history sila and was bombarded by nightmare. Parang binaril ako sa puso, legit. Ganun pala yung feeling? While he was still sleeping, I made it through their bottom of their chat history. 3 days na silang magkausap sa messenger but based sa first convo nila, tinuloy lang nila yung paguusap nila dun. The third party has a car. (Okay?). That day pala na na-late sya sa work, nakipag meet sya sa third-party and they went on a date (‘di ko sure if date lang). Ang galing lang from “pre” to “baby” yung transition ng tawag nya sa kanya although the third party has seemingly more “uninterested” and was only treating their meet-up a casual blind date based sa replies nya na “ako din”, “sorry pre, cancel muna today, may lakad ako” to my bf’s spam messages na: “nakauwi na po ako, nag enjoy ako kanina pre, salamat sa treat” , // “lunch ko na po” “kelan next natin kita? Miss na po kita sobra”- that time na i checked him sa store nung na late sya at kasabay ko pa syang kumain sa fastdood is the same time when he chatted him this sweet texts using my phone. (fast hands. sneaky right?!?!). Gusto kong umiyak pero parang namanhid yung buo kong katawan. MONTHSARY NAMIN KINABUKASAN. That even tho he was so full of efforts and I gave it back everytime i’m paying off their electricity bill and bumibili ulam tuwing wala kami makain sa bahay nila to the point na yung maiipon ko pa sana and maipapambili ng mga personal necessities ko nasasacrificebko na sa financial assistance for his family kase sobrang mahal ko yung tap e tapos ito yung igaganti nya sa akin? i asked myself that day “what went wrong?” or worse “is something wrong with me?”. Before the alarm goes off I made sure i deleted all the history and recent activity sa phone nya para hindi sya makahalata. I pretended not to know off his face. THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I GOT CHEATED ON. Dahil may shift ako kinagabihan, i decided to had an open forum with my 2 closest colleagues sa work to get an advice. One said, “confront” the third-party, the other says “confront my bf”. 2 actions were taken. He greeted me “Happy Monthsary” with a long message and highlighted context “sana wala magbago sa’tin” during my lunch break around 12:00 am. Little did he know me and my 2 friends were spying his messenger and after he sent me that f*ckass message, he had 2 missed calls sa thrid-party na restricted pala sa messenger nya kapag kasama nya ako. So we decided to messaged the ‘kabit’ using my number introducing me as his “bf” and sa text tinanong ko san sila nagkakilala, kelan pa sila nagsimula magusap. I had to be calm and straightforward sa text and ended it “kung ikaw kase nasa sitwasyon ko, mararamdaman mo din yung nararamdaman ko ngayon”.. That same morning, ka-out ko sa work, i followed my OG bestie’s advice na i-confront naman sya. I ignored him and head straight sa bed pero he was so agitated and keeps asking “babe, are you okay?”, but to his eyes, alam niyang may alam na ako. He then followed “Babe kausapin mo naman ako, sabihin mo na” while hugging me from the back, laying in bed and all, while looking straight into my eyes, being innocent and apologetic. Hindi ko alam bakit naging soft-hearted yung approach ko. I asked “Sino si *****” and he cried and repeteadly said “sorry”...”i’m so sorry babe”…”sorry po”.. in sequence — Nagawa lang naman daw nya yun dahil ayaw nyang makadagdag pa sya sa pinoproblema ko (dahil i had a lot on my plate, like family problem, struggles sa work from toxic management, keeping myself together being a working student-given the time-frame he cheated). KINAILANGAN NYA LANG DAW MAY MAPAG-OPENAN NG PROBLEMA. (They met on a dating app.) Why he has to be forgiven? I know my bf deep down. To his cof, sya yung lagi nagbibigay advise. Sya yung nagch-cheer up sa kanila. Sa family, sya yung bread winner. He can’t show any signs of weakness to the people who looks up to him—reason kaya RAW nya nagawa yun. Nagkita lang daw sila that day sa cdc and kumain. So as a first timer na victim of cheating, and because I love him deatest, apology accepted. He swore he’ll never do it again and will never keep secreta from me again..that seems like a solid reconciliation and deal. July-August. We were happy again. Until last week, i’m seeing the same pattern again. So i decided to check his phone just few hours ago and dahil mas humasa na yung skills ko sa pagiimbestiga, nahuli ko agad. Nasa recently deleted messages. May naka-restrict din sa ig. Idk if it was the same person but i guess i should make a move. The NEW THIRD-PARTY also has a car. And nagkita na sila nung august 6, the day na nagpaalam sya na mag-o-OT ng 1hr was the time he spared so they could meet. How did i know paano sila nagkaalaman ng number which is their primary contact? Sa screentime nya sa settings, laging may playstore at maps usage for 10 consecutive days. Solid evidence he installed that dating app again. 

Genuine Question:
Nagpapaka martyr na ba ako because this was the best i’ve ever treated sa relationship not knowing this side of him first-hand? What should I do? What would be my next move? Na-attached na ako sa family nya. They were so kind to me. Totoo nga siguro yung sabi nila, na ang swerte sa jowa, hindi swerte sa family side, pero ang swerte sa family side, hindi swerte sa jowa.

1mnmxe5,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarfree/comments/1mnmxe5/1_month_almost_sugar_free/,1 month (almost) sugar free!,"I never would have imagined this was possible for me! I used to eat around 50-100 grams of sugar daily, sometimes even more. snacks were a core part of my diet and I needed them at night, and i made coffee and tea with loads of sugar multiple times a day.

now at day 27, I can't lie I've had sugar a few times. but now everything with white sugar tastes too sweet for me and store brought snacks, juice and soda are straight up unappealing.

my skin cleared up a LOT. I haven't had a cystic breakout except for during the first week when I was ""purging."" my skin looks so much healthier and my facial structure is less bloated and more defined. I also got rid of the eye circles i thought were genetic.

I haven't lost a significant amount of weight on the scale but I look and feel slimmer. I get bloated way less often and feel a lot lighter, my joints also hurt less than before. 

my energy levels improved a lot. I wake up energised and dont feel like sleeping in and I rarely get sleepy during the day. I also sleep better and deeper at night. 

my focus has also improved, I used to struggle when I read books because I'd constantly lose focus but now I can read 15-20 pages in a row no problem (i could barely read a page before before losing focus.)

I also have way less cravings for food in general and don't really use it for comfort. the couple of times I had sugar was when I was going out or if a family member had made sweets and I didn't want to refuse, but I only ate a little. I feel so much better! I will definitely not be going back to sugary drinks and snacks especially.

It’s frustrating because coffee is a simple thing to manage, and it feels like she expects everyone else to do her work for her. Meanwhile, the rest of us chip in and keep the kitchen stocked without complaints.

1mnmnj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mnmnj5/aitah_for_being_disrespectful_to_my_boyfriends/,AITAH for being 'disrespectful' to my boyfriend's mother?,"Me and my boyfriend have been together for 1 year. I've always felt as if his mother has had something against me for our entire relationship and this has caused a lot of problems for me. We still live with our parents, my boyfriend is legally able to move out, learn to drive and legally go places without having to ask permission (this will be important!). However, he used to have a curfew every time he saw me! Yep, you heard that right, a curfew. His mother treats him as if he is a child and still grounds and punishes him for the smallest things. I find this absolutely insane as firstly, his sisters never got this treatment and secondly, I was always given freedom. The first time I met her she gave me what felt like a fake greeting with a fake smile and rarely ever initiated conversation with me. By the way, I was diagnosed with social anxiety at 10 and have all the symptoms of autism (no, I am not self diagnosing and yes, I will be getting tested). This means I struggle with meeting others I don't know well and have a hard time in conversations. Despite her knowing this, has never tried getting to know me nor had any long conversations. Every argument that they have always involves him not seeing me (as if she wants to punish me, too). One time I was at his house, he went downstairs and had a small argument with his mum for some stupid reason. You know what she said? ""Get her out, NOW"" (referring to me, shocker, she doesn't even say my name). 

I don't believe that this has anything to do with me, maybe she just doesn't like me for no reason at all. I know this because the rest of his family have always treated me like their own and have been nothing but kind to me. His dad, who  invited me to go shopping with him and have a lovely meal with him and my boyfriend. We had amazing conversations and we got to know each other so well. He was extremely kind and funny and said he would love to do it another time. Since then, we play games together with my boyfriend and have lots of fun. Two of his sisters whom I had met a few times invited me to ALSO go shopping and also have a meal, I got to know them really well and it was so fun. I was also invited to go fishing with them which was also a great experience. His much younger sister absolutely adores me and always greets me with a smile and draws and makes me things and hugs me often. However, his mum always goes out to nice places but has yet to invite me to go anywhere with her or get to know me. My boyfriend really wanted us to have a connection, so asked her if I could tag along to go to a caravan place for a few nights with her and his younger sister. His sister was thrilled and also wanted me to go, his mum said yes. You think I went? NOPE. She made up some excuse and just said ""another time"" a couple days before the trip. There was never another time. I always felt as if she hated me, yet couldn't do anything about it. These problems with his mother do not stop there. My boyfriend has told me about countless instances where he had been dehumanised and humiliated by her during silly and small arguments. A notable time is when she poured ""WARM"" ( his words, but I believe he was just downplaying what happened) coffee on his head and it covered him head to toe. He was also kicked out of the house and he didn't know where to go (it was freezing cold and dark outside), just because she was angry. All of these stories have made me have a terrible view on her.

Now you know some of the backstory, here is where the real problem begins. I was asked to cat-sit for my sister in a city around 40 minutes from where I am for 2 nights. Now, I am definitely a home-girl and I love staying at home with my family and in my own space and I dislike being alone often. So, I asked my boyfriend to tag along because all my friends were busy that weekend. He said he would have to ask his mother, to which she said ""I don't want you to"". That means no to her, by the way. However, he saw how uncomfortable I was and decided to lie to her and said he was just going to stay at mine for another 2 nights (yes, it's wrong to lie to your own mother, but he's not a baby and she shouldn't have so much control over him anymore). She found out, as mums always do, and instead of telling her it was my fault, said it was his own. Yet, the first thing she said was ""that girl is never allowed in my home again"" and said that she would never be taking him to see me. Crazy, right? He called his dad who said it was absolutely fine he was there and had no problem with it whatsoever and that his mum was overreacting and being controlling. I want to say that they are not married and got divorced a long time ago and he dislikes her very much, I wonder why...

So, a few days ago, I asked my boyfriend to stay over a couple nights as we always do this every other week. He has his own room as my parents set up a sofa-bed and a projector in the office so he could have his own space. He obviously agreed, but said that his mother would either not agree to it or refuse to take him due to the incident I said above. I messaged my mum about this and asked if my dad would be able to pick him up. My mum was absolutely furious with this and asked why she was refusing to take him. I told her everything about what happened and she was enraged. I decided to vent to her about all the things that had happened and how I felt disregarded and disrespected by her. She called his mum a bi*** (yes, that's disrespectful and wrong, but who wouldn't react that way when her daughter is being disrespected by a 50 year-old woman, constantly?)...She reassured me and told me it wasn't my fault and just said she was jealous. I told my mum wasn't happy with any of this and wasn't happy with his mum. I said that I didn't want to show him the messages as I knew it'd be disrespectful for him to read and it was also a private conversation with me and my mother. He was furious, which is understandable because thats his own mum. However, he went way too far. He said he was thinking of breaking up with me and said what I did was disgusting. He said I ruined He said I ruined the relationship between him and my mum and I was no longer welcome in his house. He also said he will no longer be going to mine, ever and that he wouldn't want to marry someone who would do that. He said I disrespected and was rude to his own family behind his back and I was completely wrong for that. He later said he wasn't breaking up with me and he was bluffing about never going to mine or me going to his (isn't that manipulative?), but still stands by the fact I am COMPLETELY in the wrong for this. I had no choice but to apologise and tell him I'd never do such things again. He's still furious with me. So, AITAH? ",2,1754940627.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False
1mnmnhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1mnmnhw/does_revorit_keurig_starter_kit_improve_coffee/,Does Revorit Keurig Starter Kit Improve Coffee Taste? Honest Review Inside,"The Revorit RRUS15212 Keurig Starter Kit Replacement for Keurig 2.0 Brewers is one of those products I didn’t know I needed until I started using it. As a lover of a good cup of coffee, I consider anything that enhances the experience worth trying. Having spent several weeks with this kit, I’ve encountered both delightful surprises and minor annoyances that I’ll share here.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that stood out was the design of the filter holder. It feels solid yet lightweight, thanks to its use of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) material. The holder is sturdy and perfectly sized at 8.16 x 2.3 inches, making it sit snugly in the Keurig reservoir without feeling obtrusive. I appreciate how it’s as functional as it is simple, all while having an eco-friendly touch that doesn’t scream, “Hey, I’m cutting corners!” It genuinely feels well thought out, and yes, it fits right into my K-Cafe without any fiddling. However, the same can’t be said for all Keurig models – more on that later.  

**Wide Compatibility for Keurig Brewers**  
One of the strongest selling points of this kit is its compatibility. It works seamlessly with a host of 2.0 Keurig models: K Select, K-Classic, K-Supreme, and more. I personally tested it with both a K-Duo Plus and a K-Iced, and I faced no issues. That said, I did notice a clear caveat mentioned in the product details—if you own models like the K200 or K250, this kit won’t be your best friend. It’s crucial to check your machine’s reservoir type and dimensions before purchasing, especially with the ‘Tall’ or ‘Short’ handle options.  

[See Revorit RRUS15212 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0cjfc3dl5/)

**Premium Filtration Performance**  
The difference in taste was immediate. The activated organic charcoal in the 12 replacement filters effectively removes impurities such as chlorine and calcium while retaining essential minerals, a feature that made me go, “Wow, my coffee finally tastes the way it was meant to.” I used regular tap water for brewing before and after implementing this kit, and the improvement was night and day. One thing that made this kit a winner for me was its ability to maintain consistent flavor across several brews, even when I extended the 60-day recommended replacement period by a week or two.  

**Ease of Installation and Maintenance**  
Setting it up was a breeze. The clear instructions were a lifesaver, especially for someone like me who tends to skim and overlook key points (I’m only human). The filter holder slid nicely into place, and swapping out old filters for new ones didn’t require any pulling muscles I didn’t know existed. One thing, though, is that remembering to change the filters every 60 days or 60 refills felt like a chore. Life gets busy, and you don’t exactly put “buy replacement filters” at the top of your to-do list.  

**Good Points**  
- Seamless compatibility with a variety of Keurig models.  
- Filters are crafted with premium organic charcoal for an enhanced coffee flavor.  
- Eco-conscious materials in both holder and filters.  
- Quick installation process with minimal fuss.  

**Caveats**  
- Limited suitability for some Keurig models (like K200/K250).  
- Requires monitoring for filter replacements every 60 days, which can become tedious.  

**Competing Products**  
When comparing this starter kit to similar offerings, like the Keurig-branded water filter kits, several things became apparent. While Keurig’s official products might have the brand name backing, I found their filters didn’t last as long and were a tad pricier. Another competitor, Maxware, offers a comparable kit, but their holder quality felt flimsy in contrast. Revorit’s build quality, combined with thoughtful adjustments like tall and short handle options, gave it an edge over these rivals. Still, Maxware’s slightly cheaper cost might appeal to budget-conscious shoppers. Overall, this kit strikes a brilliant balance between affordability and reliability.

**Money's Worth**  
Let’s address the elephant in the room—how does this stack up in terms of value? Judging by its performance, quality build, and eco-friendly emphasis, it certainly gives you a lot for what you pay. Comparable kits are either lacking in quality or feature fewer replacement filters. With 12 filters included, it’s essentially set up for a whole year of usage, assuming normal coffee brewing habits. Would it be worth the investment? For anyone who uses their Keurig religiously, absolutely yes.

Brings cookies, remembers birthdays, asks about your life like just a genuinely amazing human being who I adore. Her coffee is absolutely horrific though, but the thing is that she's so proud of it. First day I started she goes 'everyone loves my coffee' with this huge smile and I just couldn't destroy her. So I've pretending it's delicious for the last 3 years or so.  
She retires in 3 weeks and I'm genuinely heartbroken about losing her cuz she's been like a work mom to me. I'm not going to tell her the truth like ever and will take this to my grave but I just had to take it all out

1mnmm4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1mnmm4g/i_thought_a_female_obgyn_would_take_me_seriously/,I thought a female OBGYN would take me seriously,"After years of being dismissed by a male OBGYN, I decided to switch to a female provider. Well, she was even more dismissive, but I figured that I wouldn’t need to see her often, and I was still more comfortable with her than the pro life male doctor. 

Fast forward a few months, and I felt a lump. I chalked it up to being due for my period. Two weeks after my period, three more lumps had shown up and the area surrounding them became painful, red, and hard. I requested an appointment with my OBGYN for a breast exam. I circled the lumps and mapped out the area that was painful. I put an “x” in the circles over the lumps where the swelling made it difficult to feel. My aunt passed of IBC at 38, so I wanted to be sure I was being as thorough as I could be. 

“I don’t feel anything in the left breast. Do you drink a lot of coffee?” 

“I drink about 2 cups a day.”

“Excessive caffeine intake can raise prolactin levels, which can cause cysts in the breasts, which is probably what you’re feeling in the right breast.”

“Do you think you could order labs for me? I was told by a Dr not affiliated with this hospital that I had high testosterone.”

“We don’t really do hormonal tests unless the patient is in menopause or experiencing new facial hair growth/ hair loss.”

“I have been experiencing new facial hair growth and hair loss, as I mentioned that at my last appointment.”

“We can test your prolactin. I’ll also call in an ultrasound.”

That is not the entirety of the conversation, but I overall felt like I had to fight tooth and nail for any sort of testing. There have also been moments where I messaged her and she has not allowed me to reply to her response. For example, I was on my period for 2.5 months and messaged her. She said the hormones in the IUD would take a few months to regulate my period. I have the copper IUD. She did not give me the ability to reply to her message and correct the confusion. 

Fast forward to today

“Prolactin levels are normal as is your T4. Tsh is below normal. You should speak to your PCP.” - the OBGYN 

Her medical assistant calls me about the ultrasound. I tell her the lumps have grown since Friday when I saw the Dr. last. 

“The earliest our imaging center could get you in is the 22nd, but I understand you’re worried, the lumps are growing, and you have a family history of IBC. I can send your referral to this imaging center so you can be seen sooner. It’s also usually cheaper for patients.” 

Why do I feel like every goddamn thing is a struggle? I’m nervous. Why do you have to buck at everything I ask? I am paying to see you for 15 minutes. I understand I’m young, so you thought it was related to prolactin, but my levels were normal, and you just told me to see a pcp? You tell me I should be examining my breasts a week after my period. Have you not been listening? I noticed them and monitored them during and after my period before coming in. They have just gotten worse. I don’t care if it’s probably not cancer. I have been feeling like crap for ages, and you know that. Why is it so hard for you to just listen and test my testosterone???? ",1,1754940541.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

There is a bathroom in each floor shared by 4 people. Truthfully speaking 3 of the roommates are not at home most of the time (work long hours during weekends and go to their parents’ place on Thursday)

The remaining 4 of us hangout in the kitchen very often and now one of them is on vacation. 

The other guy is the only one who’s dating and he keeps bringing his girlfriend quite often. She lives in a different city but used to come here monthly once and stay over for 4-5 days. She was here in the beginning of this month for the weekend and went back. But came again last weekend and has been here for 6 days now (He has told us before she’s coming in such short period again because none of her roommates are at home and since it’s a new city she doesn’t know a lot of people and feels lonely but he didn’t tell us how long she’d be here for)

She does this often where she stays over for longer period. She was here the entire Christmas holiday (They both are internationals and don’t have a ‘home’ to visit)

Should I complain about this to the landlord? I’m a bit confused because she does stay in his room most of the time and comes to kitchen only to get some water once in a while or with him to cook or the bathroom when she needs to. She hasn’t been particularly rude to any of us and even makes us coffee or matcha or offer us food if she’s cooking. Our expenses doesn’t increase because of her usage because we all pay a flat rate to landlord every month independent of usage and like I mentioned before 3 of my roommates don’t even stay at home. I can’t complain legally because in the country we live in it is legal to have guest for upto 6 weeks and landlord can’t say anything there. But when she is here our roommate doesn’t hang out with us as much and they cook elaborate meals which is sometimes smelly (he usually cooks quick meals or frozen food when he’s alone).

1mnmi5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mnmi5u/falling_out_with_friend/,Falling out with friend,"I need some help understanding this situation. This is going to be long. I struggle with brevity on a good day and this is a complex situation with a lot of non traditional dynamics to explain. Also, I changed the names, just in case. 

First, let me give some context. John is one of my best friends. I talk to John more than anyone else and we have a very close and affectionate friendship. John and I have never crossed any sexual/romantic boundaries, but do cuddle and we are very loving towards each other. John and I are both poly. I’m bi and though I do enjoy romantic relationships, they are not as important to me as they seem to be to others. John is on the ace spectrum and doesn’t often have romantic/sexual interest in people. We are also both neurodivergent, we both have ADHD and have wondered about autism, but neither of us have sought any assessments. We met back in college and have been friends since, growing especially close over the last several years. I met John through Fuzzy (this is what I’ve always called our friend Nick). John and Fuzzy know each other from high school. Fuzzy is a good friend from college and back then we had a close friendship including sex, but never committed to any formal relationship (My choice, he would have, but was also comfortable with what we had). Fuzzy eventually met someone and started a relationship, eventually got married, and just recently has gone through a divorce. We’ve all remained friends over the years and have seen each other when able, as we all live in different states. John and I visit each other or travel somewhere together at least a couple of times a year. I always visit Fuzzy when I go home (he lives in our home state) as well as occasionally seeing him in my state or visiting John at the same time. 

So a couple of months ago, shortly after he found out about his divorce, Fuzzy invited John and I to join him on a trip to SD (his wife was originally supposed to go). John flew into my city and we drove to SD together and Fuzzy flew directly into SD. We had a fun trip and I can’t remember any tension. On the trip two things happened that caught my attention. One was that Fuzzy made a comment about not wanting to make John feel awkward or something. I can’t remember why, but whatever the context was made me wonder if he thought something about John and I that’s not true. I said something like, “you know John and I are just friends, right?” And he confirmed, so I didn’t think much more of it. The other thing was that he was just acting a little flirty and had brought up sex a couple of times, and the interactions made me think he was probably going to try to sleep with me again now that he’s divorced. Not something I am interested in at this time, but not a big deal to me at all. 

So then recently Fuzzy decided to come visit Colorado and we asked John to join if he could. It ended up working out that Fuzzy would come here for a few days, then do a couple solo days (I had stuff I needed to do), then he and I would spend a few more days hanging out, and then John would come in that weekend. So Fuzzy came that Wednesday and we were on our way back from dinner and somehow the subject of love came up and we were talking about different people we’ve loved. He then asked if I loved John and I said I did and then because he seemed to think differently, I clarified that I loved him as a friend. Then later that night while we were working on a puzzle he said something about John and I being together. I was surprised and explained that we aren’t together. Fuzzy then said that we sleep together, and I agreed that we sleep together but platonically as friends. He then pointedly said something like, “and you fuck” and I corrected that we have never fucked. It was honestly a sort of comical moment because he was so sure of what he was saying, but he was so wrong. But Fuzzy was very confused and said that John had told him that we were sleeping together, to which I said I would be very surprised because we’re not. Fuzzy then told me about two incidents that made him think we were together. One was at a friend of theirs’ place, where the friend apparently asked how John and I were doing and if we were still poly. An easy misunderstanding probably. And then Fuzzy explained that John and he had talked at some point about it and that he specifically remembers John saying something about wanting to tell him because of our (Fuzzy and my) history.

So also during the first part of Fuzzy’s visit he (as I guessed he would) expressed interest in sleeping together (sexually) and I refused, citing several reasons  including me having compartmentalized thinking of him (Fuzzy) in a sexual way a long time ago and that I didn’t know if I’d ever be interested in that again, not wanting to complicate our friendship, not thinking it’s a good idea since he JUST got divorced, and, most important to this issue specifically, needing to clear up the misunderstanding with John before I would do that even if I wanted to.

So then on my first solo night (while Fuzzy was gone) I talked to John on the phone and wanted to clear that confusion up. I explained the backstory of my thoughts from the SD trip. As I was telling him the two things from SD (that I thought Fuzzy would try to sleep with me and that I thought Fuzzy was confused about our relationship) I said that I thought I might have told him that before, maybe on the drive back from SD. He said I didn’t and I was surprised, because I thought I had, but it wasn’t an important thing to me. I just filled him in and moved on to the stuff from the first part of Fuzzy’s trip. John said that he thought it was just a misunderstanding from a time we both stayed at Fuzzy’s house. Fuzzy had been planning for me to sleep in his guest room in the basement and for John to sleep in a guest room on the first floor, so John said something about us usually sleeping together and that he would just go downstairs with me and maybe something about hoping that wasn’t weird for Fuzzy because of our history. 

John and I talked for a while after that and it seemed like a good call. I literally had no idea anything was amiss until I got this text from John around midnight a couple nights after our phone call: 

“I have to say something. I actually initially felt like we had a good conversation the other night, but I was thinking back to some of the things you said and some things started clicking for me. The thing that’s bothering me the most is when you said you thought you told me on the drive back from SD about there being some developing tension between you and Nick. Then I remembered how he wanted to talk to you alone the last night we were there (at the time I didn’t think much of it and kind of assumed it was something about the divorce he felt more comfortable sharing with you).

Then, we spent hours in the car the next day (as I recall, with not a ton of conversation), and we’ve talked probably 5 or 6 times in the couple months since then? I’m not really buying that you just forgot to ever mention it. I think, for whatever reason, you felt uncomfortable sharing that with me.

I could be wrong, but my best guess is that you thought I might feel a certain way about it? I think that’s a possibility, but I’m certain I would have felt much better about it if you told me back then. One of the things that really brought it into focus was you mentioning Hanna and Eric. I know that was a different situation, but there are definitely some similarities here with the secrecy and deception.

As I said before, the part that bothers me the most is the “I thought I told you,” because I think you knew you did not, and that feels manipulative. I’ve never really thought of you as that kind of person, but I’m questioning a lot of things now.

I think it’s best that I don’t join you in Colorado this weekend. Let’s maybe talk in a couple weeks when I’m back from the convention around the 21st.”

*For clarity on the Hanna/Eric thing. This is something that happened years ago. Hanna was one of my best friends and Eric was a friend I had a close sexual friendship with. We had established boundaries, had made agreements, and I had explicitly had conversations with both Hanna and Eric that I would want to know if anything ever happened between them and they had said nothing had and that they would tell me if it did. They spent weeks (at least) sneaking around together, having sex, actively lying and manipulating me and all along continuing to spend a ton of time with the three of us acting as though everything was normal.*

It admittedly took me several days to respond. I didn’t think I had a deadline to respond since he had said we’d “maybe talk” after the 21st. The whole thing caught me off guard and it took me a while to process. Plus, Fuzzy was here and we were actively traveling and doing things everyday. 

Anyway this was my response: 

“John, I’ve been really struggling with responding to this. Your message caught me so off guard and was so out of character for you. I finally had some time to myself today and there are a lot of things I need to address.

First, you’re wrong in your assumption that I intentionally didn’t tell you that I thought Fuzzy might try to fuck me. And, you’re wrong in your assumption that I said “I thought I told you” in an attempt to manipulate you. I had zero reservations about telling you that and no reason to hide it from you or to manipulate you into thinking I had already told you about it. I genuinely thought I had told you. I had intended to tell you the two thoughts I had from SD (Fuzzy’s confusion about us and his potential interest) and I thought I had. I didn’t really think much about it, because they were just a couple of things I found amusing, so I’m willing to accept that I didn’t, but I meant it when I said I thought I had told you already. When I was telling you about it on the phone the other day I kind of thought you had just forgotten about it, because I have a vague memory of us talking and you saying something about Fuzzy maybe not understanding different dynamics or making assumptions based on a monogamous mindset or something like that. I can’t remember the specifics, but I thought we had that conversation in response to me telling you that I thought Fuzzy was under the impression we were together after the SD trip. Again, I don’t have a clear memory of it and I’ll accept that I was incorrect and that the conversation I’m thinking of was about something else or maybe even with someone else, but that’s what I was thinking at the time. Whether or not you “buy it”, I apparently did forget to tell you.

Second, the “developing tension” between Fuzzy and me in SD was literally just me noticing him being flirty and bringing up sex more than usual. I had a *feeling* that he was going to make a move at some point, but nothing actually happened then. He never said or did anything in SD to directly let me know he was interested, but I had the feeling he would at some point. To me, it was just a silly prediction I made that happened to come true (in that he did make it known/make a move on this trip). 

Third, Fuzzy asked to speak to me alone that night in SD. I did not initiate it and I had no reason to refuse. What he wanted did not involve any interest in me, nor did it have anything to do with you and I, or with you in general. It was something private to him that he decided he wanted to tell me about. This is at least the second time you’ve mentioned this, and while I definitely understand being curious and maybe even having felt a little left out at that point, I don’t think there is anything wrong with me being available to a friend who wanted to confide something in me. 

Finally, I need to address how I’m feeling.

I’m really bothered by your assumption that I lied to and manipulated you. I freely and openly told you about the Fuzzy stuff from SD and from this visit on the phone. As soon as Fuzzy and I had the conversation about him thinking we were dating and/or fucking I knew I wanted to talk to you and clear things up. And I did that as soon as I could, the first time I was away from Fuzzy and the first time I talked to you after the conversation. And to be clear, I wanted to talk to you, not because I thought I was obligated to do so, but because there was clearly some kind of misunderstanding and I didn’t know where it originated and I didn’t want to hurt you if I had missed something. 

The part about Fuzzy trying to fuck me was just something I wanted to tell you. I had no idea that it was going to cause any kind of tension. I just usually tell you most things, especially sexual adventures and stories involving men and I thought it was funny that after all this time he would jump right back to that. I had no reason to think this would bother you. I also don’t think I was under any obligation to tell you this. I mentioned it because it added some context to the overall questions I had and what I was ultimately seeking, which was clarity on whether Fuzzy was just confused or if there was some misunderstanding between you and I regarding our relationship. 

I’m now really wondering if there was more to it than Fuzzy just being confused. This feels like it stems from some unspoken expectations. When Fuzzy and I had that conversation (about you and I dating/fucking) I was really confident that he was simply mistaken. I thought he had likely just misunderstood something you said and/or made some assumptions based on seeing you and I interact affectionately. He was so adamant that you had told him that we were together and that Travis had also seemingly been under that impression, so I wanted to talk to you about it in case I had been clueless about something, but I was still fairly certain it was just a misunderstanding on his part. He even tried positing some hypotheticals like “is it possible John thought you had an unspoken agreement?” or “do you think John wants to be more than friends and just hasn’t told you?” and each time I confidently responded that I’d be very surprised because I was so sure you would have talked to me about any feelings or expectations you had. 

To be absolutely clear, if you wanted us to be anything more than just friends or if you had expectations for how I act or communicate with anyone else, you should have talked to me about it. You don’t get to unilaterally come up with whatever rules and expectations feel right to you and then hold those against me as though I’ve done something wrong. Especially when those expectations apparently include the need to tell you when I *think* someone *might* make a move on me. You and I have talked about how frustrating it is when people have unspoken expectations and the importance of being clear in setting boundaries or making relationship agreements. We’ve always seemed to align on that and it’s why I was so certain Fuzzy was wrong, because I was positive you would have talked to me about any feelings or expectations you had. You even said something on the phone the other day along the lines of “even if we were dating it wouldn’t matter since we’re poly” and I said, “It could, depending on the agreements we might have,” because I do understand how that could be a boundary in some situations. 

I’m especially frustrated  because I tried to be as sensitive as possible to your feelings even though we have never made any agreements or had any conversations about being anything other than just friends. After I told Fuzzy we were just friends and that I didn’t believe you had any feelings or expectations for me (which I truly believed) and he had made it clear he was interested in me, I gave him several reasons I wasn’t going to let anything happen, including that I wouldn’t even consider it until clarifying things with you. When he asked why I would need to talk to you if we weren’t together/had no agreements, I told him that even though I didn’t think there was any reason you would care, I didn’t want to do anything that might hurt you in case he was right about your understanding of things and I had missed something somehow. Even when he wanted to just cuddle, I told him that I wasn’t sure it was a good idea, because you and I often sleep together and I didn’t want to be in a position where one of you felt hurt or left out when you were both here and he readily agreed that he understood that I would likely be sleeping with you once you got here and that he wouldn’t hold that against us. I just really feel like I was considerate of your feelings, and that I took more care than I necessarily had to since we’ve never had any conversations about any agreements or expectations between us and because I truly believed you would have been direct with me if anything had changed for you. Especially considering that we have had many conversations where we’ve laughed about other people thinking we’re together and being unable to understand that we’re just really close friends. If anything has changed for you or you have any need to set boundaries or request agreements, that is your responsibility to communicate. 

I’m also really hurt and disappointed that you would bring the whole Hanna and Eric thing into this. You know how much that fucked me up and it’s unbelievable that you would weaponize that against me. That situation was a huge violation on so many levels and still affects my ability to trust people. In that situation, Eric and I had made agreements, established boundaries, and made plans for any need to change those, I had spoken to them both about my feelings and expectations, and they spent weeks (at least) actively lying to and manipulating me to my face. Me being mistaken about telling you something is in no way the same. There was no secrecy or deception here, just your false assumptions. 

I’m sincerely so confused by this whole thing. I’m angry and hurt and just really confused. You are one of my very best friends, the person I talk to most, and one of the few people I thought really understood me. I would have thought you would have given me the benefit of the doubt and discussed things with me before jumping to conclusions, throwing a grenade into our friendship, and then slamming the door. Your message was rude and unfounded, and your decision not to have a conversation with me, but to cancel your trip and say you’d “maybe talk” to me in a couple weeks was mean and unfair. All of this feels so out of character for you and I’m having a really hard time understanding it.”

He took a little more than a day to respond and said:

“I understand you must feel shocked, confused, angry, and sad, and I am sorry for that. I’ve felt a fair bit of that over the past year too, but less so now. I’ve been reflecting a lot on whether I might be wrong, if I’m overreacting, or if I’ve ever had unfair or unreasonable expectations. It’s certainly possible that I’m wrong, but I’ll tell you why I don’t think I am, and why that isn’t even necessarily the biggest issue.

It’s interesting that you would say this is out of character for me, because I had a conversation on Wednesday about this very thing. I was asked the question “do you feel that you can stand by what you’ve said and have acted in a way that is consistent with your character?” The answer is yes, I did, and I still feel that way. I’ve actually been feeling a surprising relief and calm over the past week that I didn’t expect. I now realize that, from your perspective, me finally setting a boundary and standing up for myself might seem out of character.

I also think that you have been consistent. The length and the tone of your response is exactly what I expected, and I don’t mean that in a good way. I understand you probably needed some time to process things, but the fact that I received no response of any kind, not even a simple acknowledgment that you had received the message and understood you wouldn’t be picking me up from the airport, says a lot to me. I haven’t heard anything from Nick at all. That also says a lot to me.

Acknowledgment is not too much to ask. Rather than acknowledging that I exist, you spend 6 days carefully crafting a novel about exactly why you are right and I am wrong, full stop. It never occurred to you to recognize that my feelings might matter and have some validity.

I’m also very disappointed in how flippant you were about the power you have over Nick in this situation. He’s in a vulnerable time right now with the divorce. He is of course craving affection and intimate connection, and your fairly carefree and upbeat sentiment about the whole thing really didn’t sit well with me. Consider the possibility that you haven’t been as subtle as you think you have been.

We’ll talk more, but I can’t say exactly when. I’ve been going back over a lot of moments in the past year that didn’t sit quite right with me at the time, and now that I’ve removed the blinders, I’m recognizing some patterns that I unfortunately can’t unsee. It’s going to be a process, and I don’t yet know what the end result will be.”

I responded about 12 hours later and said: 

“I don’t think you do fully understand how confused and upset I am. 

From my perspective everything was fine, literally completely normal. Then the Fuzzy stuff came up, and I talked to you about it as soon as I could. That conversation seemed to go well and I left it still thinking everything with us was totally fine. Then you sent a message accusing me of something I didn’t do, canceling our plans, and telling me you weren’t going to talk to me for a couple of weeks. 

That caught me totally off guard and yes I did need time to process, but I also didn’t think you were waiting for a response. I took your dismissal until the 21st literally, as you didn’t intend to talk to me until then. So, I wanted to respond, but I didn’t think I had any reason to rush it. I was really busy and had limited time to myself, so I waited until I had the time to properly address it. I am sorry that it hurt your feelings. I can understand how it could have felt like I was ignoring you, and I wish I had realized that before. As far as you not having heard from Fuzzy, that’s not within my control. You never reached out to him to let him know you weren’t coming or anything else, so maybe that has something to do with it. It also may be that he was waiting for me to respond, since I was the one you messaged. I’m not really sure, that’s his choice. 

You said “It never occurred to you to recognize that my feelings might matter and have some validity.” and I need to correct that because I absolutely did. Everything in your first message related to your assumption that I had kept information from you and then tried to manipulate you by saying that I thought I told you. My focus was definitely on correcting that, because it is not true. Even still I did give a lot of consideration to your feelings. I’m sorry that you don’t see that, but I promise you that I have and will continue to try to understand and empathize with your feelings. I don’t think defending myself from your false accusations cancels that out. Your first message didn’t talk about your feelings, it hurled accusations. I think the conversation would have gone much differently if you had talked about your feelings instead. 

It would still go a long way. You still haven’t actually talked about your feelings or what you’re upset about. At first you said it was all about the “I thought I told you” thing, but now you’re saying it’s a year's worth of grievances you haven’t talked to me about. I don’t know how I’m supposed to know things are bothering you if we don’t talk about them. 

You also said, “I now realize that, from your perspective, me finally setting a boundary and standing up for myself might seem out of character.” and that’s completely unfair. In your first message, you never set a boundary and you stood up for yourself against a totally made up scenario. If you actually reread your original message, can you point out where you address your feelings or set a boundary? Maybe that was your intention, but what you actually sent me is just accusations and punishment. 

When I said this feels out of character for you, I meant things like you making assumptions and accusations, escalating so quickly from 0 to cancelling your trip, using my trauma against me, and insulting my character. I would expect you to be direct about things that are bothering you as they come up, to address things calmly and with respect for each other, to ask for clarity, to want to work together to resolve the issue. I was surprised by your approach and it did seem out of character to me. It still does.  

I’m also really bothered by your statement regarding my “power over Nick”. It’s not my responsibility to manage any man’s attraction to me and it’s sexist to suggest otherwise. Fuzzy is a grown man and it’s his responsibility to navigate his interactions with women. Also, Fuzzy and I navigated that situation fine without your approval. He expressed his interest multiple times and he even argued against some of my reasons for not allowing it, including me telling him that I didn’t think it was a good idea so soon after his divorce or as the first person since his divorce. Amazingly the one reason neither of you seem to give much consideration to is that I did not want to do it. Either way, I told him explicitly that I wasn’t going to fuck him. I told him that multiple times and gave multiple reasons. When I was talking to you and being flippant and carefree, I thought I was talking to a friend who knows me well enough to know I would consider Fuzzy’s feelings, not someone who was actively compiling a list of complaints against me. I had serious heartfelt conversations with Fuzzy regarding this and that should be between us. 

Ok, I want to take a moment to address something I think you might be forgetting or not fully understanding. 

I love you so much and your feelings are so important to me. You are one of the most important people to me. You are the person I talk to most. The person I keep in touch with even when I can’t keep in touch with anyone else. I’ve really felt like we share a special bond and like we align on so much and understand each other so well. I came to you at the start of this because I care so much for you. Fuzzy had me convinced we had this huge misunderstanding between us and I was so concerned I had missed something and was hurting or would hurt you. It’s so upsetting to me that we’re in this situation, especially because I still don’t really understand what’s happened. 

With that said, I really hope there is a way to resolve this. I have clearly deeply hurt you and I want to understand and try to repair that. You have also deeply hurt me and I’m going to need to talk about that as well. 

When you’re ready, I’m willing to talk, but I need us both to show up working towards understanding and empathy. I’m not willing to accept blame for things I didn’t do or to allow you to further insult me. Take whatever time you need and if you come to a place where you are really ready to talk about the issues, then I’ll be here.”

John texted me the next morning: 

“I don’t need any time. You will never manipulate and belittle me again. I now see this is exactly what you did to me in September, because the lovebombing phase for me ended for me a few months before that. Now it’s our friend Fuzzy’s turn. Everything makes perfect sense. I’m not confused at all, and I don’t think you are either. At bare minimum, you are emotionally immature, perhaps a degree of emotionally abusive. I now understand exactly what your granny meant. You always have to be right. I wish you well with that, Lucy.”

So then John and Fuzzy talked at some point that day. And a little while later John texted me:

“Okay, I’m ready to talk about my feelings when you are ready to hear it. I’m sorry for reacting so strongly, but I think when I explain everything you will understand.”

Then I got another message from him, just a couple hours after the previous one (I had not yet responded). It said: 

“I’m going to concede this to you. It was unfair of me to assume intent. It’s entirely possible to be hurtful and harmful without doing it intentionally. I do still see a pattern with you that is problematic, and I’d like to talk about it when you’re ready to do that. If you’re angry and hurt and need some time, that’s fair.”

Then Fuzzy called and told me he talked to him and gave me some info. He’s apparently still upset about the “I thought I told you” thing, but I guess now he’s saying that there are these patterns of things I do and that I might not even be aware I do them. He apparently talked about my shitty taste in men and said that when I’m talking to someone new I get distant and start treating him poorly. He said I go through these cycles of love bombing and being distant. Fuzzy tried to walk the line of sharing some insight without violating their friendship, which I appreciate because I’m sincerely confused. I agree that there are times John and I talk more or are more engaged and there are times when one or both of us have stuff going on and we’re less engaged or talking less, but I disagree with the accusation that I’ve love bombed him or treated him poorly in any intentional way. Relationships of any kind ebb and flow and I didn’t realize that was an issue. I just wish he could have brought up negative feelings before they became so big. I recognize that you can hurt someone unintentionally, and I wish I had known I was doing something that was causing him pain. Anyway, I guess Fuzzy mostly listened and tried not to take sides (which is good, I’ve told him I don’t want him to take my side, because he has seemed to a little bit and I don’t want this to hurt their friendship too). But I guess he did tell him he thought the comment about my granny was out of line. 

Then John actually texted me while I was on the phone with Fuzzy, so shortly after they had spoken. He said:

“I do also want to say I’m really sorry about mentioning your granny’s comment, I know that was too far. Clearly I was frustrated, but I know how hurt you were by that, and I’m sorry.”

I hadn’t responded at all, because I was really hurt and was processing and trying to decide if I should respond and if so, how to respond.  And then a few hours later he texted again saying:

“Clearly I’ve been all over the place emotionally today. I think it was because I finally talked to Nick and started second-guessing things. But it made me anxious again, which gave me some clarity.

I’m sorry, but the apology about mentioning your granny was coerced. It wasn’t authentic. The truth is I agree with her and empathize with her. I also recently thought about the comment that guy made to you about feeling like walking on eggshells. I agree with and empathize with that sentiment.

I admitted aloud last week that I felt like a piece of shit for days after I saw you in September. I admitted that I feel relief about never having to feel like that again.

I admitted last night that I don’t even want to talk to you on the phone because I’m afraid of being manipulated.

I have to trust my instincts, Lucy. I don’t like conflict, I don’t like feeling badly about myself, I don’t like second-guessing if I’m going to do or say the right thing. I’m a kind, calm, empathetic person, and I don’t have these issues with other people in my life.

I know you’ll see this as confirmation that I haven’t been talking about things, and maybe that’s somewhat fair, but I think much of it is also a symptom of manipulation and emotional abuse. I’ve been afraid to bring up issues because of how defensive and critical you are.

This past week I’ve felt relief. I haven’t felt as sad as I thought I would. I’m really sorry, but that’s the truth.”

 And that’s where things stand. I never responded. I don’t know what to say and it seems pointless. 

I’m still really confused about a lot of it. I’m so sorry that he’s been hurting and I really wish I could fix it. I just really don’t understand some of what he’s saying, especially the accusations that I’ve been manipulative or abusive. I’ve wracked my memories for anything toxic and I just can’t find it. It’s either something that’s been misunderstood or I’m literally blind to it. While I don’t doubt that I’ve done things that are hurtful at times, I’m having a hard time accepting that I’ve been manipulative or abusive. John and I have had very few arguments or tense moments and I’ve been going over them wondering if I missed something in them. 

He brought up September, so I’ll try to share what I remember about that. He came to visit for a few days in September. He’s been here several times, so he doesn’t usually have many things he feels strongly about doing. He expressed that he was feeling pretty lazy and didn’t want to do much, except see some of our other friends and maybe camp at some point. We spent the first couple of days mostly just chilling at my place. He would sleep late, make coffee and roll some cigarettes and spliffs. We would chat a bit and kind of just coexist, which is something we have always done and have talked about enjoying about each other. Then we’d usually watch something or play a game/do a puzzle. I think friends came over one night for games. It was a very chill vibe. Or at least, that’s what I thought. I was happy to do very little, because I was in a low period (I struggle with depression) and was just feeling kind of blah and disconnected. So then I had a really rough night with a migraine (I get them fairly often) and was kind of out of it on maybe the third day of John’s visit. He expressed that he was feeling more like doing something that day and I told him I didn’t feel well, but would try to do something if he wanted. He wanted to go camping and I had started feeling a little bit better, so we decided to go to a spot we’d been before that‘s a couple hours from my place. I was still not feeling great, but was managing, just not super energetic or engaging. So we drove out and were getting camp set up. We’d put up the tent and then I was trying to inflate my air mattress. I had never taken it camping before, but I didn’t feel great so we had decided to bring it for comfort. Then I realized I hadn’t brought the attachment to be able to run the pump with my car. I was frustrated with myself, because I had specially thought about it, but “knew” it was in the bag. I admit that I was not in a good mood at this point, but thought I had really only directed it at myself aside from maybe being a bit snippy. I was trying to figure out another way to inflate the air mattress, hoping to use my tire pump (it did not work haha) and John was just standing over me watching. I asked him if he could work on something else to help set up camp, like startIng the fire. I really tried to ask politely, but I accept this might have come across snarky. I just felt awkward having him watching me trying and failing to correct my mistake of not being the power adapter and knew there were other things that could be done. Eventually I gave up on the air mattress and let it go, because we’ve always camped without it anyway. We had a fire and hung out around it for the evening. We ate and chatted a bit, but it was a pretty quiet, low energy evening. At some point I started feeling worse again, maybe the smoke from the fire or the altitude. At some point we put the fire out and went into the tent. We talked and cuddled a bit and then tried to go to sleep. I laid there for a long time, just feeling worse and worse. I think I had already gotten up to be sick once already and I was really just miserable. Eventually I worked up the courage to ask John if we could leave. I hated asking, because I knew how annoying it would be, but I was just so uncomfortable. I woke him up as gently as I could and explained that I was feeling really ill and asked if he’d be ok with us leaving. He was clearly frustrated and he said he thought it would be best if we waited until morning. I accepted this, even though I felt rough because I knew I was asking a lot, and went back to trying to fall asleep. Then he kept bringing it up, saying things like, “well, if you’re really miserable I guess we can” but I told him that I didn’t want it to be a big deal and that it was fine that we wait until morning. He brought it up enough that I finally told him that it had been hard to ask but that I accepted his answer, and was feeling embarrassed and asked if we could just drop it. At some point a little after this, I got up to either go to the bathroom or to be sick, I can’t remember. Then I heard John up and moving around and came back to him annoyed and putting our stuff in the car. We had a very tense, quiet drive back to my place and then when we got back we talked about why we were both upset. I expressed that I was frustrated because it felt like he had made leaving a big deal and then forced me to do it, despite me accepting that we weren’t because I didn’t want to be a big inconvenience. I have a hard time asking others for help/care and he knew that and it felt like I got punished for asking for something even when I was totally ok with the “no” I got. He then told me that he felt like I had been distant his whole visit and that it felt like I didn’t even want him there. I apologized and expressed that I was happy to have him, and reminded him that I had expressed my excitement before he came and after he arrived. I hadn’t realized he’d been feeling that way, but apologized for not showing up in a way that felt good to him. I explained about feeling more depressed and less engaged, but told him it had nothing to do with him or how I felt about him. He expressed that I’d been less cuddly, and I explained that I was just feeling that way, not specifically with him, but just less physical because of my mood. This has also been true with my sex drive as well, my mood was just affecting my ability and desire to engage physically. We went to bed separately that night still pretty tense. He went and spent the day with another friend and then that evening we talked more. We both apologized for stuff and it seemed like things were ok, if a little sore. The rest of his trip seemed to do ok. He brought up my physical distance again at one point, because we had been cuddling and I asked him not to touch my bare skin because his hands were clammy (a side effect of his adderall) and he got upset, basically expressing that I’d barely been affectionate and then was being critical of that. I felt bad and explained that it was just a sensory thing, that I just didn’t like the feeling. I apologized and tried to engage physically more to reassure him, but I also felt frustrated because it felt like he had some sort of entitlement to me. But anyway, things mostly seemed ok after that. We talked about it I think just once more after he left, both expressing sadness about the tension and desire to move past it. And I thought we had. 

Other than that, the only thing that he’s mentioned in the last several months is that we’ve not talked quite as much. Again, I’ve been struggling more with my depression and some big life changes and I just tend to isolate when I’m not feeling great. Even still we’ve talked regularly, texting and a few hours on the phone weekly (just a little less than our highest periods). But the couple of times he’s expressed anything about it, I explained that it’s just me dealing with my own stuff and not any negative toward him. I’ve apologized for not being able to show up as well as other times and have tried to engage as much as I’ve been able. He also came to visit again in November, and we did the SD trip in May and everything seemed fine.

1mnmi5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1mnmi5i/a_general_psa_to_dbs_stop_neglecting_your_children/,A General PSA to DBs: Stop Neglecting Your Children,"I follow the modern nanny on Instagram (@the.modern.nanny) and she recently posted a reel about what she does to ""prepare"" her husband to care for their child while she's out, and the gag is that she does absolutely nothing lol. It reminded me of an incident that I witnessed last week while waiting in the drive thru of one of my favorite coffee places, and I need to share it here because I am seriously fed up with the weaponized incompetence of DBs/dads who shirk responsibilities or are completely negligent when their wife isn't around. 

I was waiting in the drive thru line with my partner at a local coffee place we really love, having a great day. It's usually fairly busy and there's a parking lot behind the coffee place, and then an industrial drive that runs parallel to the coffee place, to the right of the drive thru lane, a grassy ditch separating the two. People usually park their cars on the side of this industrial drive for overflow parking, and the industrial drive connects to the parking lot, so there are always cars swinging around into the drive to get back onto the main road. This is also a roastery/event space with other small businesses behind it, so imagine all this traffic on a Saturday going down this small road. 

I see this hipster bro dude carrying a drink carrier and a paper bag, hands completely full, heading from the back of the parking lot to his car. I assume he's alone. Then as he approaches his SUV, I see a tiny child, no more than two, toddling out from the side of the car and walking slowly into the middle of the road. I panic because I assume that's not his kid: it must be someone else's and they wandered away from another car? I alert my partner and I'm getting ready to literally jump out of our car and run over to scoop the toddler up, and simultaneously I watch this man load all of his stuff into his car, sit down in the driver's seat to put all of his stuff away, sit there for a couple minutes doing seemingly nothing, and then casually, not even with a sense of urgency or ""oh sh\*t"", slowly gets out of his seat, and I realize, out loud...""oh my god, it's HIS kid"". In the middle of him getting ready to get out of his car, a white truck starts pulling around to leave in this drive and DOESN'T EVEN SEE THE BABY, who has now moved into the middle of the road, and suddenly stops and slows down. Because there are so many blind spots due to all the parked cars, it's super easy to not see a small kid that just waltzes out from behind them. The dad doesn't give a f\*ck, doesn't wave at the truck or even acknowledge it, scoops up the kid, and starts putting them in their car seat. Meanwhile I literally yelled out loud in disbelief ""what the F\*CK?"" (not my favorite energy to have before getting coffee) and this asshole drives away, la dee f\*cking da, after handing to his kid what looked like a very large pastry. I'm still in shock about it. I don't even think I fully enjoyed my coffee that day. 

I cannot imagine a) putting your sh\*t away first before safely buckling in your baby and ensuring they're good. You know what you do with all of your coffee sh\*t, Dads? You either don't order five million things you can't carry without being able to safely hold their hand in a busy-ass parking lot, or you set it down!!!!! You don't just mosey your way into putting your stupid cold brew and croissant and five million orders in your car and then somehow sit and have a THINK about it, fully sitting in the driver's seat while your child is WALKING INTO AN ACTIVE ROAD and b) YOUR CHILD IS WALKING INTO AN ACTIVE ROAD!!!! The fact that you have no sense of concern, no moment of ""oh my god!"" tells me you do this all. The. Time. Your kid. Comes. First. Hell, don't even GET coffee if you can't handle watching your child simultaneously. WHY WOULDN'T YOU USE THE DRIVE THRU THAT IS SO READILY AVAILABLE AND HAS VERY NICE, AWESOME PEOPLE WORKING IT?????? HELLO?????? God this pissed me off, it still does. I can just picture this dude coming home to his wife or girlfriend and being like ""I got you coffee babe AND I watched our baby"" conveniently leaving out that he essentially left his toddler for a sequel to Mad Max in front of a truck. Why do I feel like kids should be wearing helmets at all times if they're alone with their dads? Would that help you watch your kids for once, fellas? 

This is unfortunately another stupid addendum on a very long list of me witnessing DBs and Dads, including my own father, act completely idiotic and still walk around as if they rule the Universe (you can barely change a diaper without whining about it, stfu Kyle). If this is you, we see you. We SEE you. If I hadn't been so dumbfounded by how stupid that dad acted, I probably would have rolled down my window and asked him ""Are you okay???"" with an extreme level of sarcasm. I'm glad I work for a queer couple right now because otherwise I would probably be losing it on yet another cishet dad acting like a complete dumbass, forsaking their child's safety so they can ""still have their life before kids"". Agh! If you are this person, you may eventually be the DB that breaks me, and screaming will probably ensue.

I've read the community rules and hope this kind of post is welcome here.

I'm starting something new and wanted to reach out to any girls (20s-35s) who might be looking for this too.

It’s called The Glow & Go Club, and it’s meant to be a space for us to connect, feel good, and take care of ourselves without all the pressure of hustle culture. 
I’m based in the Ottawa/Gatineau area, and I really wanted to create a community that's all about softness, cozy vibes, and just being ourselves.

The whole idea is to build an intentional girlhood community where we can:

Glow ✨: Through things like self-care, books(fiction & self-development, a mixture of both!), soft routines, and just showing up for ourselves.

Go 💛: With gentle movement like walks or runs, and growing together through community and setting healthy boundaries.

This isn't about crazy schedules or being perfect. It’s about creating a soft place to land, a space to breathe, and a way to connect with other like-minded women.

For now, the community is growing on Instagram and TikTok, where I'm sharing the vibe of the club. The goal is to start hosting calm, cozy IRL events in the Ottawa/Gatineau area soon (think group walks/runs, pilates&coffee, book chats..).
If you're not local, you're still absolutely so welcome to be part of the online community (planning for Online events too, especially with the winter coming up haha!)

If this sounds like something you’d be into or know someone, I’d love for you to join our little safe cozy space.

Can't wait to create something soft and wonderful together 💛


You can find us on:

I hope to see you around soon :)

My apologies if I jump around. About 5 years ago I started to develop pains in my upper stomach and the feeling of acid reflux. I tried to eat cleaner and blander and nothing worked. After a trip to the gastrointestinal she prescribed me omeprozole, that didn’t work. So my dosage was upped and that didn’t work. I finally grabbed the courage to go for endoscopy. I was nervous waiting for the results. I sat down with her and she said there was nothing organically wrong going on with me and stop medication immediately. Within a split second my symptoms went away and left there and had 3 slices of pizza. At this time I was going through a rough patch with some family issue. I suffer general anxiety and my symptoms went to my stomach. Fast forward to 4 years later which is last year I started symptoms again after coming down with the flu. This time symptoms changed and my mouth became dry and white spots on my tongue. Again the gastrointestinal told me to lesson my work schedule and stop stress. The omeprozole didn’t work again. I went to ent he saw nothing. My mouth continued to be dry and tongue inflamed. I tried everything biotine lozenges. I mean everything. I was then prescribed clomothazole lozenges because a dr said it could be fungus. That didn’t work. I then came down with bronchitis and was put on antibiotics. My symptoms went away but my tongue and throat still was off. 2 months later Out of no where it went away. It went away for 6 months then one night I had a tequila, coffee, sauce, chocolate and sauce again next day and my tongue throat symptoms returned. Again I went to all doctors again and they can’t find anything. I didn’t not go for endoscopy this time. I am under stress due to a few things going on but this time it’s all good things. One doctor put me on diflucon just today and I started taking B12. It’s odd because yesterday.  I had 3 espressos and sauce and nothing bothered me. I wake up every morning with a clear whitish coat on tongue and dry. This is a journey to find out what your body is calling for. Hopefully it goes away on its own some how. Stress has a big deal on what happens to your body and foods can trigger symptoms with the stress. I will let you know how it goes. ",2,1754940113.0,GERD,0,1.0,False
1mnmeg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1mnmeg7/theres_something_in_my_voice/,There’s Something in My Voice,"I work nights at a suicide prevention hotline. It’s a crummy office, flickering lights & the smell of old coffee baked into everything. Most calls are rough, people crying or scared, spilling their guts. You get used to it, let their pain roll off you. But last winter, one call messed me up. That voice, or whatever it was, still messes with my head. I hear it in my dreams, cold & heavy, like it’s lodged somewhere behind my ears.


It was 3:12 AM when my phone rang. No caller ID, just this weird static, almost like a heartbeat. I slid my headset on, the cheap Logitech thing squeaking against my ear.


“Hope Line, how can I help?” My voice was shaky.


Nothing. Just this thick silence that made my chest feel tight.


“Hey, you there? Are you in trouble or something?”


A crackle cut through, sharp like glass breaking.


“Do you believe in possession?” The voice was a woman’s, but it sounded… wrong. Rough. Scratchy. Like she was choking on something alive.


I felt goosebumps run up my arms. The office lights hummed louder, & I swear the shadows shifted just a little.


“Huh?” My throat was dry.


“I’m not alone,” she hissed. “It’s in my mouth. When I talk, it moves. It’s taking my words, my breath… everything.”


My stomach twisted. Every bit of training told me to keep her on the line, but something in me screamed to hang up.


“I tried to end myself,” she said, softer now. “Not to end my life, to stop it. The pills didn’t work. It pulled me back, laughing in my head.”


I gripped the headset tighter. “What’s your name? Are you safe right now?”


She laughed. Wet & broken. Not human.


“It’s awake,” she said, her voice thick, like something was crawling up her throat. “It smells you. It’s watching.”


Then came a clicking sound. Teeth on bone. Steady & hungry. My hand twitched toward the phone to hang up, but I couldn’t move it all the way, like something had its fingers wrapped around mine.


“It likes you,” she growled. The clicking sped up, like nails tapping a coffin lid. Then she started repeating my words back to me, but twisted & late, like she was stealing them.


I went silent.


“I’m not her anymore,” it said. The voice wasn’t hers. “She’s trapped beneath me, screaming in the dark.”


I slammed the phone down. Told myself it was just a sick prank. But the calls kept coming. Always 3:12 AM. Always different women. Always the same voice. Always the same clicking. I stopped telling my boss, Marcy, when she said I was just tired. I started dreading the night shift.


Sometimes the voice spoke before I did. Sometimes I caught myself talking to the bathroom mirror in that same warped tone.


Then came last night.


The phone rang at 3:12. New voice, scared. “I’m not inside her anymore.” The line cut out.


I stared at my reflection in the dark computer monitor. My mouth looked wrong. Something shifted behind my teeth. I tried to yell, but the sound came out sharp & wrong.


That was 19 days ago. I haven’t been back to work since.


The clicking’s not just in the phone now. It’s in my teeth. Every time I talk, I feel it grind, like bone on bone. The neighbors whisper about “strange sounds” from my apartment, & when I open the door, they stare at my mouth like they already know.


Two nights ago, I woke up choking. My tongue felt huge, swelling fast, & my throat was closing. Under all that panic, I felt something pushing up, sliding under my skin like a hand under a blanket. I stumbled to the bathroom, hit the light, & my reflection didn’t match. My mouth was clamped shut in the mirror while I was gasping. Then it smiled.


I stopped answering the phone, but it doesn’t need one anymore. It talks through anything with a speaker. My microwave — a beat-up Emerson — my TV, my old Dell laptop. It waits until the room is dead quiet, then whispers in my ear.


Last night, the shower drain spoke.


“Let me in all the way,” it said. “I can help you.”


I didn’t answer, but my mouth did. My lips moved on their own, saying yes, yes, yes.


When I came to, the water was freezing. My skin looked pale & thin, shapes moving under it. Something slow crawled up my neck, leaving a dark line.


I tried sleeping with the TV on. Around 2 AM, the screen went black, & my reflection leaned forward even though I hadn’t moved.


Tonight, the phone rang. 3:12 exactly. I didn’t touch it. The voice came anyway.


“It’s not in her anymore. It’s not in you either.”


The bathroom mirror laughed. The glass shook with it. Clicking started again, but not from my teeth.


It’s in the hallway.

We had a pretty great relationship, all of my friends and family were in shock when I told them what happened. I haven't really talked to her since the breakup, then yesterday afternoon I ran into her and we ended up sitting down and talking for an hour and a half. The conversation was great, we were laughing and smiling the whole time, touching each other's arms, and and had two big hugs to start and end the convo. I also kind of got the vibe she at a couple different points was wanting me to ask her out, but it's hard to tell if I was just being hopeful/wishful thinking on that aspect. I didn't think really the reasons for the breakup were fair at the time but after time in therapy, I think I get where she was coming from (lacking motivation, lack of vulnerability were two main things). I also have a lost a ton of weight since the breakup, I really feel like a changed person for the better. It seems like most people say the person doing the breakup should be the one to reach out to try again, but part of me wants to reach out and see if she'd want to meet up this weekend just for a coffee or something casual, and I think it's a way I've actually done work on myself to change in the vulnerability and motivation (going for what i want) aspect.

I went no contact with my entire family of origin because they all sided with my abusive ex husband. You can check my post history, but last year we separated when he was arrested for attacking me. A peace bond is still in place and exchanges for my children are done with my ex mother in law. We share 50/50 custody. 

I learned through my children that my parents and my brother still meet him for coffee, dinners and cake. I sent one last message to my SIL (my brothers wife) saying that I’m sorry they made that choice but I’m going to have to remove them from my life. 

Since then there has been nothing. Radio silence. 

I have a new relationship and another child. They didn’t know about my pregnancy and will never meet their grandchild. 

I don’t care to even know if they die or not. I don’t want their money or the house. I want nothing. 

I just feel sad. I hate that I have family like this. I don’t even consider them family anymore. They’re just people I used to know. I don’t even have photos of them anymore. I deleted everything. It’s just too painful. 

Am I wrong for feeling nothing? Am I selfish for leaving? Sometimes I feel like I am the bad child that should be punished. I am in therapy for all the abuse I suffered as a child scapegoat.

Im a little too obsessed with coffee. I’m the type who will happily spend a Saturday morning hiking a scenic trail, then spend the afternoon browsing thrift stores in search of that one perfect piece clothing item, whether it’s a vintage belt or a crisp button-up that’s destined to be worn fully buttoned and layered under a cozy oversized sweater. My style leans timeless but playful, with a mix of clean lines, interesting textures, and little details that make an outfit feel like mine.

When I’m not out exploring or shopping, you’ll probably find me curled up with a book, binging a great series, or tinkering with a new recipe in the kitchen (results range from delicious to “let’s order pizza”). I love live music nights, spontaneous road trips, and conversations that skip small talk in favor of big ideas and genuine laughs.

I’m looking for someone kind, curious, and open-minded, someone who can appreciate my interess, isn’t afraid to get a little lost while exploring, and knows how to make an ordinary day feel like an adventure. Bonus points if you can introduce me to your favorite hidden gem coffee shop or show me you favorite style or ask more about mine!

((The location was The Leela Palace, Chanakyapuri.)) THESE PEOPLE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO AFFORD THIS HOTEL FOR THE FUNCTION, BUT NO MONEY FOR THE FOOD FOR US.

So, we were told to reach hotel by 8:30-9:00. A tourist vehicle picked us from campus and dropped us off at the hotel.

Since we had to wake up too early to get ready and reach there, no one could have had breakfast (hostels usually serve breakfast after 8).

When we entered the hotel, we saw everyone having breakfast, so our senior asked the NDTV team first if we were allowed, to have breakfast. They said yes, around 9:50 (in batches of 2 students). When our seniors went there, the team head of NDTV (an old lady) shouted at them and made them stop eating. When they had just begun, some of them had to leave their untouched coffee, scolded in such a manner, and one criedd, just because they were having breakfast????

That was not the end, during the whole session, we were treated as outcasts (mind you, they invited us with great excitement and respect to attend the event), the same lady kept scolding.

Cool, we had no breakfast. Coming forward to lunch, we were told that we would be served lunch, very clearly. Guess what? They made us exit right in front of the people who were having lunch, standing in queue for the buffet.

And we with empty stomachs and tired brains, were made to exit, right in front of the food and they handed us a small-sized pizza at the end, and that was it.

I hope someone from other media channels notice it and publish itt

1mnmb99,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1mnmb99/delve_into_the_best_espresso_machine_breville/,Delve Into the Best Espresso Machine Breville Barista Touch Worth It,"Breville Barista Touch Espresso Machine BES880BSS promised me a café-like experience at home, and as someone who can't survive without my morning espresso, I had to try it out. From the moment I unpacked this brushed stainless steel beauty, it was clear that this was more than just a coffee machine—it was the equivalent of a barista perched on my kitchen counter. But, as sleek as it looked, I was curious whether it could deliver the perfect espresso consistently or if I'd end up regretting splurging on this machine.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Its brushed stainless steel finish is both sturdy and elegant. It's remarkably compact given the many features it crams inside, fitting snugly on my kitchen counter without dominating the space. The thoughtful design extends to the layout, making every component, from the water tank to the bean hopper, easy to access and clean. The intuitive touchscreen is a game changer, simplifying coffee-making into an enjoyable ritual. The icons are clear, easy to navigate, and gave me a ""tech-savvy barista"" feeling every morning.

**Check [Breville BES880BSS price on Amazon.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b078wmlxxg/)**

**Ease of Use and Intuitive Features**  
As someone who's always running late in the morning, simplicity is crucial. With the touch screen, making a cup of coffee became effortless. The Grind-Brew-Milk flow felt intuitive. Customizing grind size, coffee strength, milk texture, and temperature is fun if you’re into tweaking recipes like me. I even saved personalized options for my cappuccino-loving partner and latte-art-aspiring teenager. The result? No more arguing over who messed with the settings! 

**Key Benefits**  
- Touchscreen simplifies and personalizes coffee-making.  
- Compact, space-saving design with a sturdy brushed-steel finish.  
- Integrated precision grinder and customizable features.  

**Espresso Quality and Performance**  
Breville nailed it when they used the 4 Keys formula for achieving third-wave specialty coffee at home. The espresso it delivers tastes bold yet balanced, much like what you'd expect in a good café. Thanks to the low-pressure pre-infusion, flavors were extracted evenly for every cup I brewed. And let’s talk about the ThermoJet heating system—it’s a lifesaver when you need coffee fast. Heating up in just three seconds might seem trivial, but waiting even a minute feels like eternity when you’re groggy at 6 a.m.!  

The milk frothing wand was a standout. While I've seen automatic milk frothing in other machines, the microfoam texture created here feels miles ahead. It’s perfect for latte art attempts, though my heart still sinks every time my foam art ends up looking less like a swan and more like a cloud.

**Customization and Settings**  
This machine doesn’t box you into predetermined options. Apart from the five pre-programmed café favorites, I could create up to eight custom profiles. Espresso strength, milk texture, and milk temperature adjustments were impressive, especially since people at home had very different preferences. I credit the programmable precision grind and dose control for allowing me to experiment liberally with no compromise on quality.

**Drawbacks**  
- Cleaning the milk wand after every use feels tedious.  
- Its higher price point means it’s not for casual coffee drinkers.  
- Calibrating the grind took trial and error initially.  

**Other Options**  
Though the Breville Barista Touch impressed me, machines like De’Longhi La Specialista and Gaggia Anima could rival it. De’Longhi excels in its sturdy build and manual controls, which appeal to those who prefer controlling all the nuances. However, it lacks the full touchscreen capabilities that make adjusting settings so fluid here. Gaggia, on the other hand, is friendlier on the wallet but doesn’t deliver quite the same espresso quality or frothing texture. For serious at-home coffee enthusiasts, the Barista Touch occupies a sweet spot between automation and finesse. 

**Smart Spending**  
Compared to other espresso machines I’ve tested, this model feels like a worthy investment. Features like the touchscreen, integrated grinder, and automatic milk frothing elevate the user experience. If you enjoy experimenting with coffee recipes while demanding consistently high-quality espresso, it’s absolutely worth every penny. While the upfront cost may seem steep, the quality and convenience it delivers justifies the price in the long run—especially for daily coffee drinkers intent on quitting their café habit.

His voice sliced through the room like a whip.

I blinked, heat rising to my cheeks as every eye in the conference room swung to me. My hands trembled slightly around the coffee tray, but I held onto it like my life depended on it.

Luca Steele stood at the head of the long glass table, tall, lethal, and entirely too composed for a man who’d just been drenched in a splash of boiling cappuccino. Steam still rose from his tailored black suit, but his steel-gray eyes were colder than ice.

“You’ve worked for me for two years,” he said, each word slow, deliberate, laced with venom. “And you still manage to be a walking disaster. Fix it. Or quit.”

No one dared to breathe.

The coffee stain spread across the crisp white papers in front of him, slowly bleeding into confidential numbers and contract drafts worth millions. I scrambled forward, grabbing tissues from the tray, muttering apologies that sounded too small, too broken, too pathetic.

“I’m sorry, Mr. Steele—”

“Sorry doesn’t clean Armani.” He stepped back, brushing off his sleeve with visible disgust. “And what the *hell* are you wearing?”

I froze.

His eyes dragged over me. Every inch.

My oversized brown cardigan hung off my shoulders like a borrowed curtain. The faded blouse underneath clung to me awkwardly, a button missing near the collar. The olive-green skirt was too long, too wrinkled, and paired horribly with the scuffed, worn-out flats I’d owned since college.

My foundation was two shades too pale. My lipstick was crooked. The jet-black wig I wore hung limply around my face, uncombed and clearly fake. And the massive round sunglasses I wore indoors? That was the final punchline.

I was a caricature. And everyone knew it.

Chuckles rippled softly across the room.

“I’m not running a charity,” Luca said, cutting through the silence. “If you can’t show up looking like a professional, then don’t show up at all.”

He didn’t wait for a response. He turned his back and walked toward the screen, launching into a presentation like I hadn’t just been stripped of every ounce of dignity in front of ten high-ranking executives.

I stood there, cheeks burning, throat tight.

And then I turned and walked out.

The moment the bathroom door clicked shut behind me, I collapsed into the farthest stall. My hands gripped the toilet seat as sobs wracked my chest. Quiet, sharp, hopeless sobs.

I didn’t even care about the coffee anymore. Or the cardigan. Or the snickers in the room.

I was just so… *tired*.

Tired of hiding. Tired of pretending. Tired of working ten times harder just to be invisible.

I reached into my purse for tissues and caught my reflection in the mirror through the gap in the stall door.

*God. I did look awful.*

The glasses had fogged up from my breath. My mascara was smudged beneath the frames. And the wig—it sat like a lifeless animal on my head, tangled, greasy, and suffocating. I buried my face into my hands, trying to breathe.

Then—my phone buzzed.

*LUCA STEELE.*

I swallowed hard.

I wiped my face with toilet paper, fixed my lipstick with shaking fingers, tucked a strand of wig behind my ear, and inhaled once. Twice.

By the time I stepped out of the stall, the tears were gone.

*The mask was back.*

I walked through the hallway, the same hallway I walked every day, except now it felt like a spotlight was burning holes in me. Two interns passed by, whispering a little too loudly.

“*She looks like a blind clown.”*

*“I heard she lives in her car*.”

“*She probably has blackmail on him. No way Steele keeps that thing around otherwise.”*

I didn’t flinch. I didn’t break stride. I never did.

Luca’s office loomed ahead, the frosted glass doors tall and foreboding. I stepped in without knocking.

He didn’t look up.

His office was cold, like everything else about him—monochrome, sharp lines, minimal furniture. But he was the only part of the room that radiated heat. Not warmth—heat. Intensity.

Luca Steele, age twenty-nine, CEO of one of the most ruthless corporate empires in the world. Jet-black tousled hair. Perfectly sculpted jawline. That expensive three-day stubble that looked like it belonged on a magazine cover. And those eyes—ice-colored and emotionless.They’d never softened. Not once.

For example, the other day I ordered a Matcha, and when I took a sip of it, it was pretty much straight up milk. Took it back to the store, and the same person that made it remade it and actually put the matcha in that time because the drink actually turned green. Like?

My favorite drink is the white mocha, I’m drinking a failed one right now, I just DONT UNDERSTAND why they all taste like straight up coffee and no syrup or milk. As a consumer, I can tell by the color whether or not the coffee is going to be right.

I went there because I am a local and was curious about a new place opening (and of course to get source material for gossip. What is more ancestral than gossip right?). I only walked around. We intended to have a fika but we decided not to because the place was quite crowded, the ice cream was finnished, there were a lot of wasps and the prices were expensive.

Pros
-It is a nice location.
-Child friendly (but I did not visit the art barn).
-The having events thing is appealing and if something fun comes up I might go there again.
-If you are a die hard yoga girl fan you have the chance to chat with your idol over the counter. 
-Not a pro but a valid excuse for this place. It is newly started so its understandable that they have not figured it all out yet. With time this could develop into something more attractive.

Cons
-It is expensive. Coffee was 49 SEK. At Knivsta town café it is 35 SEK (which is sort of average pricing in general). A cinnamon bun should be 30-35 SEK, Ala farms charges 45 SEK. You would actually expect a farm café to be cheaper because they dont pay rent for a city location. At a swedish bygdegård (it is sort of a community center. Typically some old building which gather people and do fika and activities) a coffee would be around 20 SEK and a cinnamon bun 10-15 SEK.
-Its overall giving exclusive upper class vibes because of the prices and the current activities. The average person wont be into buying ""artisinal craft pasta"" or ""organic family produced sourced matcha powder"". 
-Its nothing special. Its very generic. There are other, similar places that have much more ""USP"".
-Maybe a pet peeve for me but I really dislike that Rakel with exact words wrote ""come snuggle with them!"" On her IG showing herself snuggling the sheep. The sheep are in a big pasture that is not open to the public. You might get to pet the sheep through the electrical fence if you manage to attract the sheep. It is very miseleading advertisement what Rakel is posting. The only animal interaction you will get is looking at the animals roaming in their pastures. I dont get it, why make it up to be like a petting zoo and make people disappointed when they arrive??? Why not be honest about what you should expect as a visitor???

For the “Long boring post” haters, please skip this one…

So originally, we had a Google “smart speaker” shortly after they came out. For the first couple years, it spent the vast majority of its abilities just answering the same question day after day… While watching some old TV series, inevitably, either my wife or I would ask it “Hey Google. Is <whatever actor we happened to notice> still alive? Or almost as often… “When did Hal Linden die and how?” 15,000 years of human development to create a talking obituary machine.

Most of my military career was as an electronics technician. Always tinkered, built stuff, designed & built electronic toys and goo-gahs. (One was simply a small amber pill bottle with a single never-ceasing flashing red LED on top. Brought one to work to show off one day, ended up making literally hundreds of them, giving one to anyone who asked. It was NOTHING but back then, it was a spectacle. Most people had never even seen a discrete LED back then.)

So I started looking in to what else this Google Speaker could do, WITHOUT me having to relearn digital electronics all over again.

I read everything I could find on the topic here on Reddit, then went and bought my first smart wifi bulb. This particular manufacturer gave TuyaSmart as the app to control the light. After a day or two of flicking lights on and off a trillion times before finally coming to actually understand the “Pairing” process used in TuyaSmart. I was in heaven. Not only did I get it to work, I actually understood HOW it was working. Not bad for an old dude!

One little comment about Tuya… Of every app and bit of software I played with while trying to learn this “Smart Home” stuff, TuyaSmart was heads & tails over every other app I tried, going strictly for simplicity, ease of use and the sheer quantity of smart devices (both branded and no-name.) that it is able to control. And it synchronizes perfectly with Google Home!

I since went nuts and replaced most of my apartment’s light switches with smart ones, the ones that were too complicated or wired weirdly, I use smart bulbs in those rooms. For those last few items I wanted to automate but no bulbs or switch wiring, I picked up a handful of “smart 110v outlets” that just plug into your existing outlets and acts as a smart switch. They even maintain a log of the usage! (Great for firing up the coffee pot either by voice or on a timer.)

We also picked up a cheap “Amazon Return” Google Home Display for the living room and moved the Google speaker to within hearing range of the bedroom. (Nothing nicer than going straight to bed at night & just before nodding off, say “Hey Google, turn everything off.” The place goes dark and silent, except for my smart doorbell and recently-added, an outdoor PTZ security camera. All controlled by and accessible through Google Home. (The mobile app, the web app, the living room display, by voice, or I can control the whole shebang on my Apple Watch. (There’s a TuyaSmart app that runs on the watch.)

So now… between 30,000 TV channels and movies (Nvidia Shield), never having to get off my ass to turn off a light, a Quest 3 VR headset to “go” virtually anywhere in the world (virtually) whenever I want, I’m beginning to realize, at 63, I’m allowing all this cool automation to quickly make me fatter and stupider! I make an effort to walk (with a cane on one side and my wife holding my hand on the other) the 3km return trip to our little depanneur (convenience store) up the road at least once a day, and maybe a couple times a month, I’ll pack up all my drone gear, walk the 2km to the nearby sports fields and fly my drones for a bit… 

Don’t get me wrong… I absolutely love all the automation. Not so much the “having it” but “making it work”. I’ve pretty much “smartened” everything we actually use… Although I have been considering designing and 3D printing a mechanism to open and close our two tiny living room window curtains… :-)

Before making outdoor plans for my day, I’d scramble up the stairs (it’s a basement apt.) and poke my head out the door for a few minutes to get a “feel” for that day’s potential weather. Now, from the perfect ass-shaped-cushion at my end of the couch, it’s simply “Hey Google… what’s today’s weather forecast?” I don’t do normal everyday numeric calculations anymore. I just ask Google. 

Anyone else experience anything negative (mental or physical) that you think may have arisen from all of the available automation now? Are we becoming too reliant on it? Do you feel like it’s making you fatter or more stupid? Your thoughts?",2,1754939419.0,smarthome,0,0.75,False

## Open Source Hero user flair
 
The ""Open Source Hero"" is a user flair that the mod team can award to users.
 
Have a look at the [Open Source Hereos](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/1ltggbb/open_source_heroes_get_your_shiny_badge_of_honour/) post for the details.
 
 
 
## Is this Arduino genuine or fake
 
We have had a few questions from people about whether the ""Arduino"" they acquired is ""genuine or fake"". The answer to that is somewhat nuanced.
 
Have a look at our [FAQ wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/wiki/faq/) for more information about this.
 
In a nutshell, Arduino open source their design. Other companies are licensed to make their own version of an Arduino.
Their version can be as similar to the original Arduino design or include enhancements.
What Arduino Pty Ltf *do not do* is grant permission is to use Arduino ""symbols"" such as the name or the infinity symbol and others.
 
In general terms, there are:
 
* Genuine Arduinos - manufactured by (or for) Arduino Pty Ltd that will use the Arduino name and logos and other copyrighted materials.
* Clones - manufactured by other companies in accordance with Arduino's open source licencing. These could be identical, somewhat altered or quite different to a genuine Arduino, but should provide the same capabilities as a genuine one.
* Conterfeits - these are the ""illegal"" or ""counterfeit"" ones. They are not made by Arduino, but all of the labelling and packaging is duplicated (sometimes poorly) from the genuine item.
 
On the wiki page, there is also a link to Arduino's [How to spot a counterfeit Arduino](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360020652100-How-to-spot-a-counterfeit-Arduino) page.

1mnm3c1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mnm3c1,Ruined Ruinator Becomes Desecrator,"TL:DR Puppy broke freshly painter Ruinator, made some weapons and turned it into a Desecrator. 

This morning, around 4:30AM, I finished painting the carapace on my Ruinator as I wanted the rust/weathering to show up more than it did on the black armor. I took light box pictures, was pleased with the results and went to make coffee and then I heard it.

My 75 lbs American Bully puppy came barreling down the steps and straight towards the underneath of the dining room table…where he pulled the shadow box off the table, sending it crashing down, along with the Ruinator. 😢 

I heard pieces snap and hard work “Ruinatored”by a lovable fur missile.

Luckily, the waist separated cleanly from the tracks but the Fellbore and Darkflame Lance snapped at odd angles.

I finished my coffee and then had a moment of clarity! The Ruinator is garbage and I only built it because it was the first kit I bought and converted.

Long story, even longer, I gave away my extra bits to a club mate and spent some time today cleaning up the parts and making a Desecrator Laser Destructor out of the Darkflame, a marker cap, Votann Conversion Beamer lens, a cap from a GW plastic glue bottle, earbud wires, and a grounding electrical wire. The Repear Chainsword/Warpstrike Claw are from a broken 3d printed Mortarion scythe that way in th bitz box. Finally, I redid the base, creating a cliff out of toliet paper, cardboard and watered down glue, so base so that it’s proper height again.

1mnm0u8,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/1mnm0u8/some_things_in_an_office_need_to_be_managed/,Some things in an office need to be managed - especially when it comes to restocking coffee and milk. Do you agree?,"I am working at an office with a fully equipped kitchen and about 35 employees at this location. It’s a fast growing company and every month new people join the office.

When there have been working only a few people in the past the rule for the kitchen was and still is: If milk or coffee is empty anyone should go shopping and restock it. (And you get your cash back)

Nowadays no one is buying milk or coffee except for 2 people in the same department. And they complain a lot about it. 

My opinion is: At one point this way doesn’t work anymore. Some things have to be managed and some people need to be responsible for that type of work. It seems that almost no one doesn’t know that it works like that and I am not surprised.

What‘s your opinion and experience with it? Should the restocking be dedicated to some people or department? Or are they any other ideas?

1mnlzq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1mnlzq6/explore_best_french_press_coffee_maker_espro_p7/,Explore Best French Press Coffee Maker ESPRO P7 Worth the Hype,"The ESPRO 1032C2 P7 French Press has found a permanent spot in my kitchen, and not just because it looks stunning. I’ve tried numerous coffee makers over the years, but there's something undeniably special about this one. It’s not just a coffee maker—it’s a statement piece for anyone who appreciates café-quality coffee at home. The polished stainless steel finish is sleek and exudes a premium vibe, but appearance alone isn't why this French press earns its stripes.

**Build Quality and Insulation**  
The first thing I noticed was its weight. The ESPRO P7 isn’t flimsy like many other French presses I’ve tested. The double-walled stainless steel construction doesn’t just feel robust; it ensures the coffee stays piping hot for a much longer time compared to glass or single-walled alternatives. One Sunday morning, I brewed a full pot but got caught up with chores. To my amazement, the coffee was still warm and flavorful when I returned almost an hour later. I genuinely feel its thermal insulation is a game changer, and this makes it perfect for leisurely breakfasts or entertaining guests.

**Double Micro-Mesh Filter System**  
Let me tell you, this feature is where the magic happens. Unlike traditional French presses that often leave behind sediment at the bottom of your cup, this model employs a dual micro-mesh filter system. I tested it with various grind sizes, and not once did I experience that annoying gritty texture that often plagues other French presses. This made a huge difference for me since I adore smooth, clean coffee flavors. It even brews tea beautifully; my green tea came out crisp and pure without any stray leaves or particles floating around.

[Check ESPRO 1032C2 price on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b011wtmh4o/)  

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Using this French press was refreshingly straightforward. The operation is manual, which I personally love because it allows more control over the brewing process. Every part, from the plunger to the filters, feels well-made and thoughtfully designed. Cleaning was far easier than expected, despite the sophisticated design. Several times, I simply rinsed it out after use, but when I did a deeper clean, every component came apart easily and reassembled just as smoothly.

**Capacity and Serving Size**  
With a 32-ounce brewing capacity, this French press is ideal for small gatherings. I recently had a few friends over and managed to brew enough coffee to serve everyone without needing to make multiple batches. While it’s perfect for a morning pick-me-up or a cozy brunch setting, those looking to brew larger quantities might need something bigger.

**Pluses**  
- Stylish, polished stainless steel design  
- Exceptional thermal insulation with the double-walled body  
- Dual filter system ensures a smooth, grit-free brew  
- Versatile—works equally well for coffee and tea  
- Simple to disassemble and clean  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Hefty weight might not suit everyone  
- Pricier than many basic French press models  
- Some users may prefer a larger capacity for entertaining  

**Alternative Products**  
Compared to other contenders on the market, the ESPRO P7 has notable advantages. Take the Bodum Chambord, a popular glass French press. While it’s lightweight and visually appealing, its single filter system doesn’t come close to the smoothness delivered by the ESPRO P7’s dual micro-mesh setup. On the other hand, insulated models like the SterlingPro Double-Wall Press offer reasonable heat retention but lack the level of refinement and aesthetic appeal of the P7. For tea drinkers, the Fellow Clara French press is another stylish option, but even it falls short in terms of grit-free brewing consistency when using fine coffee grounds.

**Value Proposition**  
Now, I won’t deny that investing in this French press comes at a higher cost than basic models. However, the value it provides makes it well worth it. I’ve saved countless trips to coffee shops by recreating that quality at home. Considering the robust build, longevity, and the sheer joy of sediment-free coffee, it becomes clear you’re paying for a premium experience. If you’re someone who views coffee as more than just a drink and a little daily ritual, this is the one product I’d highly recommend.

i've read the community rules and i hope this kind of posts are welcome here.

I'm starting something new and wanted to reach out to any girls (20s-35s) who might be looking for this too.

It’s called The Glow & Go Club, and it’s meant to be a space for us to connect, feel good, and take care of ourselves without all the pressure of hustle culture. 
I’m based in the Ottawa/Gatineau area(Canada), and I really wanted to create a community that's all about softness, cozy vibes, and just being ourselves.

The whole idea is to build an intentional girlhood community where we can:

Glow ✨: Through things like self-care, books(fiction & self-development, a mixture of both!), soft routines, and just showing up for ourselves.
Go 💛: With gentle movement like walks or runs, and growing together through community and setting healthy boundaries.

This isn't about crazy schedules or being perfect. It’s about creating a soft place to land, a space to breathe, and a way to connect with other like-minded women.

For now, the community is growing on Instagram and TikTok, where I'm sharing the vibe of the club. The goal is to start hosting calm, cozy IRL events in the Ottawa/Gatineau area soon (think group walks/runs, pilates&coffee, book chats..). If you're not local, you're still so welcome to be part of the online community (planning for Online events too, especially with the winter coming up haha!)

If this sounds like something you’d be into or know someone, I’d love for you to join our little safe cozy space.
Can't wait to create something soft and wonderful together 💛

I hope to see you around soon :)

Hello! 

I live in the South Front Apartments and work as a merchant mariner on a 2-weeks-on / 2-weeks-off schedule. My travel dates are set months in advance, so the arrangement is very consistent.
I'm looking for a trustworthy local person to care for my extremely friendly, social cat during my away weeks. He's low-maintenance (auto-feeders, water fountain, self-cleaning litter box) and doesn't need constant attention — perfect even if you don't work from home.
This could be great for someone who enjoys cats but doesn't want the full-time commitment.
I'm happy to offer fair payment and am flexible with arrangements so we can find what works best.
Please send me a private message if this sounds like a good fit, and we can discuss more details and specifics! Happy to meet for coffee and introduce you to him!",4,1754938935.0,Wilmington,0,0.83,False
1mnlw60,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1mnlw60/is_it_common_for_other_trans_people_to_feel/,Is it common for other trans people to feel dysphoria from the T4T/4B communities?,"After having moved from a left leaning small town, to a very liberal big city, I have come across a lot of people from the T4T/4B communities (I don't know much about either group, so I hoping I'm not labeling them incorrectly or something)... Anyways,  9/10 them both seem to just hate/dislike cis men a lot. As someone who is very passible as a cis man... I'm tall, muscular, have a deep voice, hairy, into typical bro shit like sportsball, guns, beer (although I do have a nerdy friend group that I do nerd stuff with still)... I am starting to feel a bit weird about how much hatred they have towards people who look/act very similarly to me, while seemingly being totally fine with me. 

Around here, I'm more stereotypically masculine/""manly"" (however you want to define those terms), than most of the cis dudes... And if I'm being honest, I'm much less nice/passive than most cis dudes. The neighborhood I live in is the historically gay neighborhood, so it's not exactly an area full of tough/dangerous macho cis men. Most of the cis dudes I have met and hooked up with, are more of the fem/submissive type. 

So when I started meeting up with people who refuse to hookup with cismen (T4t/4B types usually), simply on the basis of their cis identity, I started to feel a bit like I'm not a ""real"" man I guess... I don't know how to word it, and I know the idea of a ""real man"" is a bit ridiculous; but that is the best way to describe it... But it definitely made me feel ""othered"", from the group I've spent over a decade trying to blend in with.

I can totally appreciate why people in smaller communities or more conservatives areas, might want to be safe about how they pick their partners. It's very reasonable for someone in a small town in Texas, to feel like they should just avoid all cis men. I didn't question why anyone in my much more rural hometown, might want to be T4T... But if anything, it was much less prevalent there, than it is here. 

This neighborhood/city, is not exactly a hotbed for anti-trans hate. As a trans man, I have never felt more acceptance/love. 9/10 cis men in my neighborhood, are very aware of trans issues and openly/proudly support trans people. Most of them attended protests, read books, listen to speakers, volunteer, donate, etc... They are on average MUCH more educated on trans topics, and also tend to be more open minded/kind hearted, when compared to the trans people I used to hookup with in my hometown. 

I have met a few bad cis dudes for sure, but so far my experiences with trans people has been arguably worse (much more negative in general, prone to anger, and sometimes even bad about consent). Obviously most trans people are awesome, but they have been noticably worse than the cis men here (so far at least). 

So now that I got that all setup, my issue is how dysphoric I can feel when someone says it's okay for me (a total stranger to this person), to come over to their place to hook-up at 12am, simply because I say I'm trans... But if I were to say I'm cis, they won't even meet me for coffee at a Starbucks that has a hires security guard there... So this doesn't seem like a safety issue here, and seems to be a bit about separating trans men from cis men in an almost TERFy sort of way (I'm hoping this isn't the case for the vast majority of trans people, at least not internationally). Like because I'm trans, I'm inherently so trustworthy/safe, but if I just say I'm cis I'm all of sudden not even someone you want to talk to anymore. 

If they can feel safe with me, an aggressive/dominant 6foot 220lbs muscular bi trans man, why do they not feel safe with my 5'8"" fem/sub twink gay cis friend? ... Because it's hard to not feel like the reason why they feel safer with me is because they don't view me as a ""real"" man, so of course I'm not as threatening (although if I'm being truly honest here, a decent amount of them seem to just hate cis men... Which is semi-understandable at least).

I apologize for the novel, and bad grammar. English isn't my first language, and I struggle with expressing my thoughts in writing... I also want to add that I don't want to be dismissive of people who have legitimate safety concerns. My goal here isn't to say that being strictly T4T/4B is inherently wrong in all circumstances. More just curious if I am the only one who has these thoughts/feelings sometimes?? ",2,1754938886.0,asktransgender,0,1.0,False
1mnlvt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mnlvt9/explore_the_breville_nespresso_essenza_mini/,Explore the Breville Nespresso Essenza Mini Espresso Machine Review,"Breville BEC250BLK1AUC1 was something I recently added to my kitchen gadgets, and I’ve spent quite some time tinkering with it daily. As someone who practically lives on espresso, having this compact machine in my coffee corner was a no-brainer. Initially, its minimalist design caught my eye, but its deeper features—and a couple of quirks—became clear only after consistent use. Still, it has definitely elevated my caffeinating game, though there are things worth considering before making the jump.

**Compact and Stylish Design**  
This espresso machine doesn’t just make coffee; it makes a statement. The sleek piano black finish, paired with its ridiculously small footprint (3.3 x 8 x 12.9 inches), gave my cluttered counter a new level of uniformity without eating up all the space. I’ve also moved it between my kitchen and office with no hassle because it barely weighs anything—just under six pounds! Despite its size, it doesn’t feel cheap, which is exceptional. Its matte exterior even does a good job of hiding fingerprints, something my older and bulkier machine failed at miserably. 

[Grab Breville BEC250BLK1AUC1 at the best price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b073zht2fm/)  

**Performance That Packs a Punch**  
Right off the bat, this machine gets two things spot-on: espresso quality and efficiency. It uses a high-pressure pump system that manages 19 bars of pressure, ensuring each cup is extracted to its full-bodied potential. Whether it’s the classic espresso shot or a slightly longer lungo, the flavor is consistent at a level you’d expect in a cozy café. I’ve been experimenting with the capsules included in the welcome set (16 in total)—the aromatic profiles range from nutty to fruity to intense. Every shot pours in under 30 seconds, which really saves me time in the morning chaos.

**Raises Questions About Ease of Use**  
One of the biggest pluses of this espresso machine is its simplicity. It’s fully automatic, and the two programmable buttons make it easy to adjust the coffee size preference. I even found reprogramming it straightforward after a couple of runs, but there was a bit of fiddling involved initially. But, as much as I might love coffee, dealing with capsules sometimes bothers me. My coworker pointed out how finding compatible capsules outside the Nespresso ecosystem can be frustrating, and I couldn’t agree more.

**Key Benefits**  
• Ultra-compact yet durable with a minimalist matte finish.  
• High-pressure pump ensures rich-tasting espresso.  
• Energy-saving modes that reduce electricity use effectively.  

**Negatives to Consider**  
Unfortunately, despite all the love for this machine, it’s not flawless.  
• Limited compatibility with third-party capsules—kind of locks you into Nespresso's options.  
• Tends to vibrate a little during operation, making my cup rattle a bit.  
• Despite programmable buttons, customizing beyond espresso and lungo isn't truly intuitive.  

**Peer Products**  
Competitor-wise, the Breville BEC250BLK1AUC1 maintains an edge for its size and speedy performance, but it isn’t without rivals. Compared to the Keurig K-Mini, this espresso machine excels at coffee quality, delivering authentic espresso instead of regular patterned drip flavors. For those who aren’t espresso enthusiasts, though, a Keurig may shine because of its broader beverage options. Meanwhile, the Lavazza Blue Classy Mini delivers similar authentic espresso but is bulkier and lacks the same sleek aesthetics. The Breville clearly comes out on top in design, making it a favorite for small kitchens or on-the-go lifestyles.

**Cost Efficiency Analysis**  
Bringing this tiny powerhouse into my daily routine felt very much worth the slightly premium price. But it really depends on your priorities. If you're an espresso lover who appreciates convenience and reliable quality, this espresso machine is a worthy investment. Energy-saving features like automatic shutoff after nine minutes make me feel less guilty about leaving it on during hectic mornings, plus the cost savings on energy bills are an added bonus.

Earth - Sometime around the 1980s

The air inside the Vostok Station observatory was dry and sharp, the kind that scratches the insides of your throat until you've swallow your first cup of coffee. Senior radar operator Dmitriv Alekseyevich had just finished brewing a steaming hot cup of coffee, the first of what he expected to be many that day. He sat at his station with his hands wrapped around the metal mug for warmth, it was sorely needed right now.  
He had been there for eight months now, eight out of his nine month rotation. He didn't envy the personnel that stayed over the winter, their rotations lasted for one and a half years.. one and a half fucking years in this barren frozen hellscape that seemingly took delight in plucking at your nerves and patience like it was some sort of instrument out of tune.

It was important to keep yourself busy with something, that something had to occupy most of your attention for the duration of your stay. The worst thing you could do was let your mind wander, many a men had lost their minds in never ending thought circles out here. The last cargo drop had been over half a year ago, and the next was still a month out. With it came the much needed supplies but more importantly, a way out, for those that were scheduled or those that needed it.

Coffee was one of the few luxuries in this frozen exile. Black, bitter, and smelling faintly of the burlap sack it had arrived in, but above all else good, good for the body, heart and soul, all at the same time.  
On the shelf above his desk sat todays main distraction, a dented old tin of biscuits, this weeks sweet ration. He reached for it, fumbling with the twisted little metal key soldered to the side. Soviet efficiency was a thing of wonder but this damned packaging left much to be desired. He hooked the tab and began twisting... \*Snap\*

""Сука блядь!"" Dmitriv muttered, glaring at the broken key. It was like this with half the rations, some tins older than he was, stamped with manufacturing dates from before the stations construction had even begun over twenty years earlier.

The lid had split just enough for him to force it open by hand, the sharp edge bit into his index finger like it thirsted for blood.

""А-а-ай! Блядь!"" He jammed the bleeding finger into his mouth, tasting iron, salt and generator lubricant.

It wasn't the first injury he had suffered out here but when compared to the hell of the last twenty-four hours it wasn't even worth noting. Yesterday, the generators had failed. Ten hours without power.. precious heat slowly dissipating as the minutes ticked by. Backups frozen solid, they had been impossible to start without hours of hard work. They'd tried hailing Mirny Station, but atmospheric interference or something had turned everything into garbled bursts of static. As he had stood next to the radio operator and caught pieces of shouting in the background on their end, something about a broadcast, and obvious panic, but it hadn't made sense at the time.

The wound stopped bleeding quickly enough. Dmitriv sipped, the now, lukewarm coffee to wash out the taste of blood, then bit into a biscuit. It was like chewing stale cardboard, dipping it into the mug to soften it didn't help, the damned thing disintegrated instantly, turning his drink into a slurry of bitterness and sand.

That was when the radar pinged.

At first, he thought it must have been his imagination, the scan lines rarely pingws off something outside the scheduled resupply drops. The green dot appeared, blinked, and with each rotation of the radar dish, moved slowly across the screen.

\*Ping\*

He leaned closer. An airplane? No, it was much to fast for that. Some sort of meteor? No, the path was different, it seemed to be slowing down. Not some sort of weather phenomenon either, the signal was too strong.

\*Ping\*

\*Ping\*

\*Ping\*

Dmitriv frowned. The trajectory put it twenty kilometers north of their position. And then..

\*Ping\* \*Ping\*\*Ping\*

He sat up straight. Two new returns had appeared, trailing the first. Moving fast.

\*Ping\* \*Ping\*Ping\*

They were rapidly closing the distance. Pursuit? Escort? Interception?

The pings grew quicker, overlapping into an insistent alarm.

Without thinking, Dmitriv pushed back from the console and ran for the door, he needed to inform the others. He burst into the corridor and took a left, just up ahead was the entrance to the commons room.. it completely empty. He looked around the room and through a frost covered window covered he could see several people. He ran back and out the nearest exit, they were just around the corner of the building and as he came closer he noticed they were all staring.. north...

""Mikhail! What's going on?"" he shouted as he approached.

Before anyone could answer, the world hit them.

A concussive blast wave rolled over the frozen tundra. It knocked Dmitriv and the others to the ground and he could feel the ice vibrating beneath them. In the distance, over the horizon, a column of dark smoke rose upwards. Faint sounds of jets could be heard flying overhead, just above the grey clouds covering the sky as far as they could see.

""What the hell was that?"" Dmitriv shouted.

""Invasion!"" Mikhail, the radio operator, yelled back, eyes wild. ""It's all over the broadcasts! We couldn't hear it yesterday with the power out, but-"" He broke off, glancing toward the smoke and pointing. ""They've come. They've found us!""

""What? The Americans?"" Dmitriv demanded. ""Nuclear bombers?""

Mikhail grabbed his shoulders with both hand, shaking him slightly as he frantically tried to explain. ""No! Aliens, Dmitriv! They took over every frequency! Said they had found us and had come for us!""

Dmitriv stared at him. ""You've been drinking the disinfectant again...""

A third voice cut in. ""He's telling the truth."" It was Captain Yuri Antonovich, the station commander. ""Get your gear. We're moving out.""

Confusion turned to urgency. Dmitriv sprinted back inside, yanking his fur lined parka from the rack and made sure his insulated gloves were in it's larger pockets. Everyone had spent the night geared up, they had all tried to sleep in thick clothing due to the cold caused by the generator failure. In this cold, exposed skin froze in minutes and it had taken hours to reheat the structures once power was restored and they could finally remove a bit of clothing.

By the time he reached the vehicle yard, the two Kharkovchanka transports were already loaded and moving, their enormous red hulls grinding across the snow on wide tank treads. Mikhail waved him toward a smaller Sno-cat idling nearby. Dmitriv climbed in, and they took off, the bigger vehicles tracks easy to follow once they lost sight of them ahead.

They drove for nearly ninety minutes across the white void. The Kharkovchankas eventually came into view, having stopped on a rise. Their crews outside, clustered along the edge of gorge up ahead.

As Dmitriv and Mikhail approached on foot, the scale of it hit him. A long, hundred meter long gorge had been gouged through the ice by the impact, hot steam instantly turning to mist in places. Pieces of twisted metal could be seen scattered around the crash site.. this was a crash site but this was no aircraft wreck Dmitriv recognized.

Yuri waved them over. Up close, the debris looked.. wrong. No bolts, no rivets, it was all smooth and seamless. Like most of the parts had been cast as a single piece. Some of the metal pieces were also wrong, it looked like iron but shimmered faintly in the sunlight. This was not a metal Dimitriv had ever seen before.

""We hold here until support arrives."" Yuri ordered. ""They've been tracking it for hours. We have aircraft inbound.""

Thirty-eight minutes later, the first plane came in low through the cloud cover, an Antonov An-12, Dmitriv thought. The side doors and rear ramp were already open before it fully touched down. A hundred soldiers in white camouflage spilled out, spreading into a defensive perimeter. Within moments, the transport was throttling up to leave, no doubt to fetch more.

The next aircraft heard but it's sound came from the wrong direction. High above the clouds as it passed over them, Dmitriv never saw the plane itself but shortly after the flyby he could see shadows erupting through the ceiling of grey.

Vehicles of some sort.

He blinked, unable to process it as parachutes began to bloom, dozens, then hundreds, carrying men and machines alike.

Mikhail's voice was tight with dread as he noticed the insignia. ""Americans!""

Yuri's order was immediate. ""Back to the vehicles. Move! We can't let them take them. Let the cold kill theirs and freeze the troops. We fall back and wait. It'll take hours at most.""

They manned the vehicles and quickly retreated about two kilometers before stopping. Through binoculars, Dmitriv tried to see what was going on at the crash site. Two figures: One Soviet, one American, walked out from their lines, meeting in the middle. After a tense few minutes, they shook hands.

The radio crackled. ""Return to site. Agreement reached.""

Dmitriv felt a strange hollowness as they rolled back. Agreement or not, he knew one thing for certain, whatever had fallen from the sky was not of human origin. Whether it had crashed or been shot down he had no idea but it had come a very long way, just to meet them.

And now, two superpowers were about to conceal it.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

Germany - A few months after the broadcasts.

The public had moved on, convinced it was all an elaborate hoax, a stunt pulled straight from the playbook of the 1938 War of the Worlds scare. The official story was believable: An art collective promoting a science fiction novel, a pre-recorded fake alien signal, a prank that had ""gotten out of hand.""  
Only a handful of people on Earth knew the truth, the whole truth, that the message was real, and that the probe that sent it was now locked inside a fortified hanger on the Antarctic ice.

Hugo Jäger had no idea any of this existed when his old professor had called him.

Hugo's mind worked differently from others, his mind saw reality like a math equation that needed to be solved. Where others saw random numbers or letters he instead saw patterns and logic.  
But if human emotions were an expressive orchestra then Hugo was stuck playing a rusty tuning fork. Not only did he barely understand them, he also found it confusingly difficult to express them.

People often thought he was cold, perhaps indifferent, but in truth feelings were to Hugo what infrared light was to the naked eye.. real, but invisible. It wasn't that he couldn't feel them, he just didn't experience them in the same way as others did. He didn't understand what a different tone, facial expression or, what people called, body language had to do with anything. And thus he expressed none of it himself.

His professor had told him only that there was a person who had a very particular problem, one that he might find solving enjoyable. Hugo arrived at the arranged meeting in a grey, dimly lit office, where the professor stood with another man, a stranger in a dark suit whose smile was polite but meaningless to Hugo. The only question Hugo wondered about was why the man was wearing sunglasses indoors.

""This is Mr. Caldwell."" the professor said. ""He represents... an interested party.""

They exchanged brief handshakes. Hugo sat. Caldwell slid three sheets of paper across the desk.

""I'd like you to read these."" Caldwell said.

Hugo glanced at the first sheet. It was gibberish, scrambled text and numbers that appeared meaningless. The same for the second, and the third as well. But when he combined them in his mind, the nonsense solved itself almost instantly.

""It's just a supply schedule."" Hugo said flatly. ""Deliveries of equipment and materials for the constructing for something in Antarctica called the Georg von Neumayer Station.""

""Impressive."" is all Caldwell could say with a raised eyebrow, he pulled out five more pieces of paper and placed them before Hugo.

If the previous ones had been garbled nonsense then these were on a whole other level. The first page looked like a chart of some sort, a list detailing German phonetics and their respective sounds, each of them assigned to a symbol. The next 3 pages were just German words and symbols arranged next to them, creating what could have been words? or perhaps translations? The last page was nothing but the strange symbols, he skimmed over them for less than a minute and found the obvious patterns quickly. It was text using these strange symbols in a unique way. Was this a language?

""It's text."" he said. ""If you take these symbols and assign them to sounds from the German language and rearrange them in these patterns, then using every single assigned word on these three pages then the last page becomes a text that can be read.""

Caldwell took out a small, blocky cassette recorder and placed it on the desk. ""Can you read it for me?""

Hugo shifted the last page over and began reading without hesitation. It made a strange and alien sounds but as he continued speaking it suddenly started to make a sort of sense to him. As if it all just fit together in a neat and predictable way. He finished after about a minute, the recorder stopped with a loud \*click\* as the button with the black square was pushed down.

Caldwell rewound the tape, then set a second recorder beside the first. He hit the play button on both devices at the same time and with almost perfect unison they started to repeat the same strange words, but with two different voices and accents. Hugo's rendition didn't wasn't quite as refined at the start but midway trough the text it started to math up perfectly with the other recorders female rendition of the text. After both had finished playing Caldwell repeated the process of hitting the buttons with black squares on them. After their double clicks both devices disappeared somewhere within his suit.

""Most impressive indeed."" the commented before asking one last question. ""Can you tell me what the words meant?""

""It's a message."" Hugo said, as be began reciting the words.

""Greetings, sentient beings. This transmission is issued by a Tier-VI Contact Probe, dispatched under the authority of the Galactic Federation of Systems, pursuant to Addendum 32b of the Null Contingency Statutes. Rescue and/or sapienitarian aid is to be provided to any ship, individual and/or crew stranded due to Null related phenomena, whether within or without charted territory, and irrespective of known contact status  
You have been found, and we have arrived.""

Hugo paused as he moved on to the next segment, it seemed like it hadn't been part of the first message. ""Greetings, sentient beings. You have discovered the landing site of this rescue vessel and activated it's automated response systems. Do not be afraid, rescue and/or aid has arrived. Contained within this vessel you will find any and all resources required to facilitate for your rescue and/or escape from the Null zone. These resources included but are not limited to: Axiom Ride for warp core heart reconstruction, designs for magnetic mass drivers for orbital injection, blueprints for orbital shipyards, and sample materials with detailed replication instructions. This unit includes a complete linguistic and symbolic primer. If current language comprehension fails or is insufficient, please hold digital storage media containing language near probe for scan, interpretation and translation.""

The words were delivered without inflection, pure information, stripped of any trace of awe or fear.

When Hugo finished, Caldwell leaned back. ""As you may have guessed, the first part is the message that was broadcast over all tv and radio stations a couple of months ago, as part of the.. publicity stunt.. .""

""I don't own a television or radio."" Hugo replied.

Caldwell frowned. ""You haven't heard of it?""

""I only read books in my spare time."" Hugo said simply.

The professor, smiling faintly, said. ""I told you, he's rather eccentric.""

""No matter."" Caldwell noted, studying Hugo for a moment. ""We'd like to offer you work. You'll be part of the most important undertaking in human history. You will have unrestricted access to any material, including any books you may require to complete your task. I can guarantee you will not be bored.""

Hugo Jäger's life changed that day. He was taken, quietly, without public record, to a secure facility where an alien probe had been moved and isolated. The icy landing site was still under constant guard, swarming with covert military personnel from multiple nations. The public believed the ""probe"" was a crashed Soviet satellite. In reality, some of the world's superpowers were working together.. barely, to keep its existence hidden.

Hugo found that he truly enjoyed the work, all of it. His world was the alien script. The probe's onboard AI, if it could even be called that, was an odd companion. If it's digital avatar was an actual representation of what the beings that had sent it looked like, or if it was the aliens equivalent of a cartoon character he did not know.  
You could not hold a proper conversation with it but if you asked it questions about what was included with the package it almost always seemed to have an answer.  
It had been programmed to help guide them every step of the way, at times with excruciatingly detailed explanations that could go on for hours, almost as if it didn't expect them to understand very basic concepts and math.

When engineers asked it how to assemble a mass driver, it began its instructions and presentation with: ""First, you will need to know what a magnet is. A magnet is...""

They quickly learnt that it was best to record every session with it as it simply refused to touch on or repeat certain topics without first explaining all the previous steps related to it. Still, the AI's precision shaved years off the timeline.

Over the decades that followed, Hugo became one of thousands working in secret to translate, reverse-engineer, and build what the probe had brought. Entire orbital infrastructure networks were designed and built with kilometer long launch rails on remote coastlines. With them you could launch pretty much anything with enough speed to exit earths gravity. Automated assembly plants were slowly built by using recycled components sent into low Earth orbit. The only limiting factor was getting actual people into space, magnetically rail launching a person would have resulted in a box filled with gore as several animal experiments proved with horrific clarity.

Eventually, the skeletal frame of humanity’s first interstellar vessel began to take shape. A solid spine, early engine bays, with each new section meticulously planned out ahead of time. It had no name yet, in fact, the project itself lacked even an official codename, a deliberate choice to preserve absolute secrecy. It was simply referred to as ""The Project"" or some derivative there of.

The first test of the alien designed FTL capable drive nearly destroyed the project. Despite repeated warnings, summarized in broken English as ""Big boom. Eyes hurt."" followed by the digital figure crying. The engineers insisted the risk were almost none existent, it was just a basic test using less than one percent of the engines calculated output and that the math suggested minimal interference at most. The result was a blinding double mushroom cloud visible for hundreds of kilometers and a seismographic shockwave that could be measured circling the earth a couple of times.

Thousands of people suffered temporary or permanent blindness. The engineers hadn't taken Axiom Rides unique properties into account during their calculations, mostly due to a lack of knowledge. In truth, the rest of the galaxy at large barely understood it more than they did. There was only a difference in experience based on how long they had been using it.

It was seen as a miracle that the AI contained a treatment protocol, but more likely an expected necessity based on previous experience. An experimental optical surgery was developed that managed to restore the sight of most victims. But the blast had drawn global attention, unwanted attention. Governments not in the loop had begun asking uncomfortable questions.

The blow came in early 2018, when every single classified file, from the first Antarctic landing to the last AI diagnostic was leaked online , a result from the first engine test drawing too much attention. Schematics for FTL drives, alien metallurgy, and mass drivers spread to every corner of the internet.

The reaction started as disbelief but quickly escalated with explosive consequences. Riots, mass hysteria, political assassinations attempts, coups. It came to a boiling point when nations threatened nuclear war unless given access to the manufacturing process for Axiom Ride. The uncomfortable truth was that it couldn’t be made on Earth. This fact was dismissed as fabricated lies meant to keep it from others, inflaming tensions even further. The world stood a hair’s breadth away from a nuclear holocaust, one that would have scoured humanity from existence.

Then came the bombing, targeting the private home of a president who had long believed himself untouchable. By sheer chance, a short traffic delay had saved his life.. had he arrived on time, he would have been killed in the blast that completely leveled his private residence. Shaken, and wielding considerable influence over the project, he began pressuring for a unified response. The other leaders involved, already growing uneasy from having numerous plots uncovered, agreed, and together they called for a summit to be held in neutral territory.

There, every excluded government could chose to attend and work towards a joint solution. For the first time in known human history, every single government and world leader on Earth gathered beneath one roof in the immense Global Assembly Hall. The agreement reached was simple on paper: all nations would send observers to the project, all information would be shared, and crews would be chosen by international recruitment and lottery. Each nation guaranteed spots for at least a couple of their citizens.

In reality, the summit changed nothing.. if anything it made things worse.

Governments that hadn't been part of the project from the start were still furious and began plotting to undermine those that had. But the nations already in the project were no better.. they too, schemed in secret, determined to see a large payout from their immense investments.  
Before long, every nation was plotting against every other, officially declared ally or not.

1mnlsg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1mnlsg4/60_days_of_daily_reading_fixed_my_brain_more_than/,60 days of daily reading fixed my brain more than any wellness trend ever did.,"A few months ago, I came home from work, collapsed on my bed, and did what I always did: opened TikTok. “Just 10 minutes to decompress,” I told myself. An hour later, my eyes were burning, my brain felt like static, and my to-do list was still untouched. I wasn’t relaxed. I was numb. My focus was shot, my sleep was trash, and every spare moment felt like it needed to be filled with scrolling.

It scared me when I realized I couldn’t remember the last time I’d read a full book. And yet, every successful person I admire talks about two habits: reading and moving their body daily. I wanted in, but the gap between where I was and who I wanted to be felt impossible.

Then I read Atomic Habits. One line hit me like a truck: “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.” I didn’t need to fix my whole life overnight. I just needed to tweak the system.

So I ran an experiment:
– 10-minute walk after dinner.
– One short workout a week if I felt like it.
– Replace TikTok with 15 minutes of reading every
    night.

I even swapped the TikTok icon with my reading app so my muscle memory worked for me. I also started stacking audiobooks with stuff I already did, while cleaning, commuting, even in the shower.

The first week was brutal. I still caught myself unlocking my phone and tapping the empty spot where TikTok used to be. But somewhere around week three, the cravings started to fade. My brain stopped needing micro-dopamine hits from 10-second videos. Stories and ideas began to feel more satisfying than swipes.

After 60 days, I’d finished 8 books (I’d read 2 total last year), my attention span doubled, and my mind felt…quiet. Like I could hear my own thoughts again.

Here’s what actually worked for me (learned from trial, error, and some therapist-approved habit science):
 –Swap the cue, not just the habit. Replacing an
    app in the exact spot your brain expects it is a
    cheat code.
 –Read fun, short stuff first. Lower friction, build
   momentum.
 –Stack habits. Pair reading with tea, skincare, or
    your commute.
 –Audiobooks = still reading. Ignore the purists.
 –Make the book impossible to miss. Desk,
    nightstand, or even as your lock screen.
 –Track books finished, not hours read.
 –Achievement triggers dopamine.
 –Don’t expect instant miracles. Your brain needs
    ~21–60 days to recalibrate dopamine pathways.
–Some resources that helped me massively (besides therapy):

During this time, I read some great books to rebuild my focus, and surprisingly, made me actually enjoy learning again. Starting with Atomic Habits by James Clear – NYT bestseller, 10M+ copies sold. Clear distills habit science into strategies you can actually stick to. This book will make you see motivation in a totally new way. Another must-read is Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport – from the author of Deep Work. This will make you rethink your entire tech diet. I closed Instagram for a week right after reading it. Game changer. I also highly recommend The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle – 5M+ copies sold, spiritual classic. This book will make you realize how much of your anxiety is controlling you.

When it comes to tools, BeFreed has been a game changer for me. A friend introduced me to this smart reading app built by scientists from Columbia U and I’m hooked. You can choose between quick 10 or 20 minute summaries or full 40 minute deep dives and even customize your reading host’s voice and tone (mine has that smoky Samantha from Her vibe, dangerously addictive). It creates a personalized learning roadmap based on your goals, struggles, and how your brain works. I’ve been knocking out books on discipline, psychology, and investing while walking or making coffee. I never thought I’d crave reading, but it gives me the same dopamine hit as scrolling and now I’m hooked on knowledge instead.

Another helpful app is Forest, where you plant a virtual tree that grows as you stay off your phone. It’s weirdly effective when paired with 15–20 minute reading sessions. And for movement, MadFit (YouTube) is my go-to: low effort, high reward workouts that pair perfectly with an audiobook. I’ve “read” whole books while doing her 20-min routines.

Replacing social media with reading didn’t just make me “productive”, it gave me back my ability to think clearly. Big tech platforms are literally engineered to hijack your dopamine system: infinite scroll, autoplay, notifications timed for max re-engagement. Over time, this rewires your brain to crave constant novelty and kills your ability to focus deeply. Reading reverses that. It forces you to slow down, follow a narrative, and rebuild your mental endurance.

If you feel stuck, burnt out, or like your attention span is fried, this is your sign. Start with one page. One paragraph. One short story before bed. You’re not broken; your brain just needs a different diet. The smartest, happiest people I know all have two habits: they read daily, and they move daily. Build that system for yourself, and watch who you become.

I've never lived out on my own before so I'm excited to try this out. I currently live on an acreage surrounded by nature where it's really scenic, quiet and chill.  But at this point in my life, I feel like I need to surround myself with more lively / hustle and bustle energy. I'd want to be able to walk to places easily or even hop on transit instead having to drive everywhere I have to go.

I was trying to figure out where to rent but it got a bit overwhelming looking at all the options.

 This is some of the criteria I'd like to be met:

* Walkable to cafes or coffee shops I can work out of, close to restaurants, grocery etc. (important)
* Club 16 gym nearby would be nice so I can keep my membership (not too important)
* Pickleball courts and a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gym close by would be nice (pretty important)
* Can spend up to $2400/mo on rent
* A quiet park / nature nearby where I can go to walk / unwind (pretty important)
* Has a lively vibe, but not super crowded
* Not in a sketchy neighborhood where there's a lot of homelessness / drug use etc.

Open to cities like Vancouver, Richmond, Burnaby, Coquitlam etc. I haven't spent a lot of time in these cities and don't know much about the vibe of each neighborhood so would really appreciate some insight. I'll be driving out to spend some time in them once I get some suggestions.

Thank you!

I never thought I’d crave reading, but it gives me the same dopamine hit as scrolling and now I’m hooked on knowledge instead.

Another helpful app is Forest, where you plant a virtual tree that grows as you stay off your phone. It’s weirdly effective when paired with 15–20 minute reading sessions. And for movement, MadFit (YouTube) is my go-to: low effort, high reward workouts that pair perfectly with an audiobook. I’ve “read” whole books while doing her 20-min routines.

Replacing social media with reading didn’t just make me “productive”, it gave me back my ability to think clearly. Big tech platforms are literally engineered to hijack your dopamine system: infinite scroll, autoplay, notifications timed for max re-engagement. Over time, this rewires your brain to crave constant novelty and kills your ability to focus deeply. Reading reverses that. It forces you to slow down, follow a narrative, and rebuild your mental endurance.

If you feel stuck, burnt out, or like your attention span is fried, this is your sign. Start with one page. One paragraph. One short story before bed. You’re not broken; your brain just needs a different diet. The smartest, happiest people I know all have two habits: they read daily, and they move daily. Build that system for yourself, and watch who you become.

I've read the community rules and hope this kind of post is welcome here.

I'm starting something new and wanted to reach out to any girls (20s-35s) who might be looking for this too.

It’s called The Glow & Go Club, and it’s meant to be a space for us to connect, feel good, and take care of ourselves without all the pressure of hustle culture. 
I’m based in the Ottawa/Gatineau area, and I really wanted to create a community that's all about softness, cozy vibes, and just being ourselves.

The whole idea is to build an intentional girlhood community where we can:

Glow ✨: Through things like self-care, books(fiction & self-development, a mixture of both!), soft routines, and just showing up for ourselves.

Go 💛: With gentle movement like walks or runs, and growing together through community and setting healthy boundaries.

This isn't about crazy schedules or being perfect. It’s about creating a soft place to land, a space to breathe, and a way to connect with other like-minded women.

For now, the community is growing on Instagram and TikTok, where I'm sharing the vibe of the club. The goal is to start hosting calm, cozy IRL events in the Ottawa/Gatineau area soon (think group walks/runs, pilates&coffee, book chats..). If you're not local, you're still so welcome to be part of the online community (planning for Online events too, especially with the winter coming up haha!)

If this sounds like something you’d be into or know someone, I’d love for you to join our little safe cozy space.
Can't wait to create something soft and wonderful together 💛

Also, it's going to be bilingual so même si vous préférez le français, vous êtes la bienvenue 🤗!


You can find us on:
TikTok: @glowandgo.space

Ig: @glowandgo_space

Will be more than happy to get some feedback :)

I hope to see you around soon :)

  I was raised to marry a monster.  
  
  The day before the wedding, I could barely breathe. Fear and fury curdled in my stomach. All afternoon I skulked in the library, running my hands over the leather spines of books I would never touch again. I leaned against the shelves and wished I could run, wished I could scream at the people who had made this fate for me.  
  
  I eyed the shadowed corners of the library. When my twin sister, Astraia, and I were little, we heard the same terrible story as other children: Demons are made of shadow. Don’t look at the shadows too long or a demon might look back. It was even more horrible for us because we regularly saw the victims of demon attacks, screaming or mute with madness. Their families had dragged them in through the hallways and begged Father to use his Hermetic arts to cure them.  
  
  Sometimes he could ease their pain, just a little. But there was no cure for the madness inflicted by demons.  
  
  And my future husband—the Gentle Lord—was the prince of demons.  
  
  He was not like the vicious, mindless shadows that he ruled. As befit a prince, he far surpassed his subjects in power: he could speak and take such form that mortal eyes could look on him and not go mad. But he was a demon still. After our wedding night, how much of me would be left?  
  
  I heard a wet cough and whirled around. Behind me stood Aunt Telomache, thin lips pressed together, one wisp of hair escaping from her bun.  
  
  “We will dress for dinner.” She said it in the same placid, matter-of-fact way that she had said it last night, You are the hope of our people. Last night, and a thousand times before.  
  
  Her voice sharpened. “Are you listening, Nyx? Your father has arranged this farewell dinner for you. Don’t be late.”  
  
  I wished I could seize her bony shoulders and shake them. It was Father’s fault that I was leaving.  
  
  “Yes, Aunt,” I whispered.  
  
  Father wore his red silk waistcoat; Astraia her ruffled blue dress with the five petticoats; Aunt Telomache her pearls; and I put on my best black mourning dress, the one with satin bows. The food was just as grand: candied almonds, pickled olives, stuffed sparrows, and Father’s best wine. One of the servants even strummed at a lute in the corner as if we were at a duke’s banquet. I almost could have pretended that Father was trying to show how much he loved me, or at least how much he honored my sacrifice. But I knew, as soon as I saw Astraia sitting red-eyed at the table, that the dinner was all for her sake.  
  
  So I sat straight-backed in my chair, barely able to choke down my food but with a smile fixed on my face. Sometimes the conversation lagged, and I heard the heavy ticktock of the grandfather clock in the sitting room, counting off each second that brought me closer to my husband. My stomach roiled, but I smiled wider and gritted out cheerful nothings about how my marriage was an adventure, how I was so excited to fight the Gentle Lord, and by the spirit of our dead mother, I swore she would be avenged.  
  
  That last made Astraia droop again, but I leaned forward and asked her about the village boy always lingering beneath her window—Adamastos or some such—and she smiled and laughed soon enough. Why shouldn’t she laugh? She could marry a mortal man and live to old age in freedom.  
  
  I knew my resentment was unfair—surely she laughed for my sake, as I smiled for hers—but it still bubbled at the back of my mind all through dinner, until every smile, every glance she darted at me scraped across my skin. My left hand clenched under the table, nails biting into my palm, but I still managed to smile back at her and pretend.  
  
  At last the servants cleared away the empty custard dishes. Father adjusted his spectacles and looked at me. I knew that he was about to sigh and repeat his favorite saying: “Duty is bitter to taste but sweet to drink.” And I knew that he’d be thinking more about how he was sacrificing one half of his wife’s legacy than how I was sacrificing life and freedom.  
  
  I surged to my feet. “Father, may I please be excused?”  
  
  Surprise caught him for a moment before he replied, “Of course, Nyx.”  
  
  I bobbed my head. “Thank you so much for dinner.”  
  
  Then I tried to flee, but in a moment Aunt Telomache was at my elbow. “Dear,” she began softly.  
  
  And Astraia was at my other elbow. “I can talk to her for just a minute, please, can’t I?” she said, and without waiting for an answer she dragged me up to her bedroom.  
  
  As soon as the door had closed behind us, she turned to me. I managed not to flinch, but I couldn’t meet her eyes. Astraia didn’t deserve anyone’s anger, least of all mine. She didn’t. But for the past few years, whenever I looked at her, all I could see was the reason that I would have to face the Gentle Lord.  
  
  One of us had to die. That was the bargain Father had struck, and it was not her fault that he had picked her to be the one who lived, but every time she smiled, I still thought: She smiles because she is safe. She is safe because I am going to die.  
  
  I used to believe that if I just tried hard enough, I could learn to love her without resentment, but finally I had accepted that it was impossible. So now I stared at one of the framed cross-stitches on the wall—a country cottage choked in roses—and prepared myself to lie and smile and lie until she had finished whatever tender moment she wanted and I could crawl into the safety of my room.  
  
  But when she said, “Nyx,” her voice was ragged and weak. Without meaning to, I looked at her—and now she had no smile, no pretty tears, only a fist pressed to her mouth as she tried to keep control. “I’m so sorry,” she said. “I know you must hate me,” and he  
r voice broke.  
  
  Suddenly I remembered one morning when we were ten and she dragged me out of the library because our old cat Penelope wouldn’t eat and wouldn’t drink and Father can fix her, can’t he? Can’t he? But she had already known the answer.  
  
  “No.” I grabbed her shoulders. “No.” The lie felt like broken glass in my throat, but anything was better than hearing that hopeless grief and knowing I had caused it.  
  
  “But you’re going to die—” She hiccupped on a sob. “Because of me—”  
  
  “Because of the Gentle Lord and Father’s bargain.” I managed to meet her eyes and summon a smile. “And who says I’ll die? Don’t you believe your own sister can defeat him?”  
  
  Her own sister was lying to her: there was no possible way for me to defeat my husband without destroying myself as well. But I’d been telling her the lie that I could kill him and come home for far too long to stop now.  
  
  “I wish I could help you,” she whispered.  
  
  You could ask to take my place.  
  
  I pushed the thought away. All Astraia’s life, Father and Aunt Telomache had coddled and protected her. They had taught her over and over that her only purpose was to be loved. It wasn’t her fault that she’d never learnt to be brave, much less that they’d picked her to live instead of me. And anyway, how could I wish to live at the price of my own sister’s life?  
  
  Astraia might not be brave, but she wanted me to live. And here I was, wishing her dead in my place.  
  
  If one of us had to die, it ought to be the one with poison in her heart.  
  
  “I don’t hate you,” I said, and I almost believed it. “I could never hate you,” I said, remembering how she clung to me after we buried Penelope beneath the apple tree. She was my twin, born only minutes after me, but in every way that mattered, she was my little sister. I had to protect her—from the Gentle Lord but also from me, from the endless envy and resentment that seethed beneath my skin.  
  
  Astraia sniffed. “Really?”  
  
  “I swear by the creek in back of the house,” I said, our private childhood variation on an oath by the river Styx. And while I said the words I was telling the truth. Because I remembered spring mornings when she helped me escape lessons to run through the woods, summer nights catching glow worms, autumn afternoons acting out the story of Persephone in the leaf pile, and winter evenings sitting by the fire when I told her everything I had studied that day and she fell asleep five times but would never admit to being bored.  
  
  Astraia pulled me forward into a hug. Her arms wrapped under my shoulder blades and her chin nestled against my shoulder, and for a moment the world was warm and safe and perfect.  
  
  Then Aunt Telomache knocked on the door. “Nyx, darling?”  
  
  “Coming!” I called, pulling away from Astraia.  
  
  “I’ll see you tomorrow,” she said. Her voice was still soft but I could tell her grief was healing, and I felt the first trickle of returning resentment.  
  
  You wanted to comfort her, I reminded myself.  
  
  “I love you,” I said, because it was true no matter what else festered in my heart, and left before she could reply.  
  
  Aunt Telomache waited for me in the hallway, her lips pursed. “Are you done chatting?”  
  
  “She’s my sister. I should say good-bye.”  
  
  “You’ll say good-bye tomorrow,” she said, drawing me toward my own bedroom. “Tonight you need to learn about your duties.”  
  
  I know my duty, I wanted to say, but followed her silently. I had borne Aunt Telomache’s preaching for years; it couldn’t get any worse now.  
  
  “Your wifely duties,” she added, opening the door to my room, and I realized that it could get infinitely worse.  
  
  Her explanation took nearly an hour. All I could do was sit still on the bed, my skin crawling and my face burning. As she droned on in her flat, nasal tones, I stared at my hands and tried to shut out her voice. The words Is that what you do with Father every night, when you think no one is watching? curled behind my teeth, but I swallowed them.  
  
  “And if he kisses you on— Are you listening, Nyx?”  
  
  I raised my head, hoping my face had stayed blank. “Yes, Aunt.”  
  
  “Of course you’re not listening.” She sighed, straightening her spectacles. “Just remember this: do whatever it takes to make him trust you. Or your mother will have died in vain.”  
  
  “Yes, Aunt.”  
  
  She kissed my cheek. “I know you’ll do well.” Then she stood. She paused in the doorway with a damp huff—she always fancied herself so beautifully poignant, but she sounded like an asthmatic cat.  
  
  “Thisbe would be so proud of you,” she murmured.  
  
  I stared straight ahead at the cabbage-roses-and-ribbons wallpaper. I could see every curlicue of the hideous pattern with perfect clarity, because Father had spent the money to give me a Hermetic lamp that shone bright and clear with captured daylight. He would use his arts to improve my room, but not to save me.  
  
  “I’m sure Mother’s proud of you too,” I said evenly. Aunt Telomache didn’t know that I knew about her and Father, so it was a safe barb. I hoped it hurt.  
  
  Another wet sigh. “Good night,” she said, and the door shut behind her.  
  
  I picked the Hermetic lamp off my bedside table. The bulb was made of frosted glass and shaped like a cabbage rose. I turned it over. On the underside of the brass base were etched the swirling lines of a Hermetic diagram. It was a simple one: just four interlocking sigils, those abstract designs whose angles and curves invoke the power of the four elements. With the lamp’s light directed down against my lap, I couldn’t make out all the lines-but I could feel the soft, pulsing buzz of the working’s four elemental hearts as they invoked earth, air, fire, and water in a careful harmony to catch sunlight all day and release it again when the lamp switch was turned on at night.  
  
  Everything in the physical world arises from the dance of the four elements, their mating and division. This principle is one of the first Hermetic teachings. So for a Hermetic working to have power, its diagram must invoke all four elements in four “hearts” of elemental energy. And for that power to be broken, all four hearts must be nullified.  
  
  I touched a fingertip to the base of the lamp and traced the looping lines of the Hermetic sigil to nullify the lamp’s connection to water. On such a small working, I didn’t need to actually inscribe the sigil with chalk or a stylus; the gesture was enough. The lamp flickered, its light turning red as the working’s Heart of Water broke, leaving it connected to only three elements.  
  
  As I started on the next sigil, I remembered the countless evenings I had spent practicing with Father, nullifying Hermetic workings such as this. He wrote one diagram after another on a wax tablet and set me to break them all. As I practiced, he read aloud to me; he said it was so that I could learn to trace the sigils despite distractions, but I knew he had another purpose. He only read me stories of heroes who died accomplishing their duty—as if my mind were a wax tablet and the stories were sigils, and by tracing them into me often enough, he could mold me into a creature of pure duty and vengeance.  
  
  His favorite was the story of Lucretia, who assassinated the tyrant who raped her, then killed herself to wipe out the shame. So she won undying fame as the woman of perfect virtue who freed Rome. Aunt Telomache loved that story too and had more than once hinted that it should comfort me, because Lucretia and I were so alike.  
  
  But Lucretia’s father hadn’t pushed her into the tyrant’s bed. Her aunt hadn’t instructed her on how to please him.  
  
  I traced the last nullifying sigil and the lamp went out. I dropped it in my lap and hugged myself, back straight and stiff, staring into the darkness. My nails dug into my arms, but inside I felt only a cold knot. In my head, Aunt Telomache’s words tangled with the lessons Father had taught me for years.  
  
  Try to move your hips. Every Hermetic working must bind the four elements. If you can’t manage anything else, lie still. As above, so below. It may hurt, but don’t cry. As within, so without. Only smile.  
  
&nb  
sp; You are the hope of our people.  
  
  My fingers writhed, clawing up and down my arms, until I couldn’t bear it anymore. I grabbed the lamp and flung it at the floor. The crash sliced through my head; it left me gasping and shivering, like all the other times I let my temper out, but the voices stopped.  
  
  “Nyx?” Aunt Telomache called through the door.  
  
  “It’s nothing. I knocked over my lamp.”  
  
  Her footsteps pattered closer, and then the door cracked open. “Are you—”  
  
  “I’m all right. The maids can clean it up tomorrow.”  
  
  “You re ally—”  
  
  “I need to be rested if I’m to use all your advice tomorrow,” I said icily, and then she finally shut the door.  
  
  I fell back against my pillows. What was it to her? I wouldn’t ever need that lamp again.  
  
  This time the cold that burned through my middle was fear, not anger.  
  
  Tomorrow I will marry a monster.  
  
  I thought of little else, all the rest of the night.

  They say that once the sky was blue, not parchment.  
  
  They say that once, if ships sailed east from Arcadia, they would reach a continent ten times larger—not plunge with the seawater down into an infinite void. In those days, we could trade with other lands; what we did not grow, we could import, instead of trying to make it with complicated Hermetic workings.  
  
  They say that once there was no Gentle Lord living in the ruined castle up on the hill. In those days, his demons did not infest every shadow; we did not pay him tribute to keep them (mostly) at bay. And he did not tempt mortals to bargain with him for magical favors that always turned to their undoing.  
  
  This is what they say:  
  
  Long ago, the island of Arcadia was only a minor province in the empire of Romana-Graecia. It was a half-wild land populated only by imperial garrisons and a rude, unlettered people who hid in thickets to worship their old, uncivilized gods and refused to call their land anything except Anglia. But when the empire fell to barbarians—when the Athena Parthenos was smashed and the seven hills burnt—Arcadia alone remained unravaged. For Prince Claudius, the youngest son of the emperor, fled there with his family. He rallied the people and the garrisons, beat back the barbarians, and created a shining kingdom.  
 No emperor before nor king after was ever so wise in judgment, so terrible in battle, so beloved of gods and men. They say that the god Hermes himself appeared to Claudius and taught him the Hermetic arts, revealing secrets that the philosophers of Romana-Graecia had never discovered.  
  
  Some say that Hermes even granted him the power to command demons. If so, then Claudius was truly the most powerful king that ever lived. Demons—those scraps of idiot malice, begotten in the depths of Tartarus—are as old as the gods, and a few have always escaped their prison to crawl through the shadows of our world. No one but the gods can stop them and no one at all can reason with them, for any mortal who sees them goes mad, and demons only desire to feast on human fear. Yet Claudius, they say, could bind them into jars with a word, so that in his kingdom nobody needed to fear the dark.  
  
  And perhaps that was where the trouble began. Arcadia was greatly blessed, and sooner or later, every blessing has a price.  
  
  For nine generations, the heirs of Claudius ruled Arcadia with wisdom and justice, defending the island and keeping the ancient lore alive. But then the gods turned against the kings, offended by some secret sin. Or the demons that Claudius had bound at last broke free. Or (but few dare say this) the gods died and left the gates of Tartarus unlocked. Whatever the reason, what happened is this: The ninth king died in the night. Before his son could be crowned the next morning, the Gentle Lord, the prince of demons, descended upon the castle. In one hour of fire and wrath he killed the prince and rent the castle stone from stone. And then he dictated to us the new terms of our existence.  
  
  It could have been worse. He did not seek to rule us like a tyrant, nor destroy us like the barbarians. He only asked for tribute, in exchange for holding his demons in check. He only offered his magical, wish-granting bargains to those who were foolish enough to ask for them.  
  
  But it was bad enough. For on the night that the Gentle Lord destroyed the line of kings, he also sundered Arcadia from the rest of the world. No more can we see the blue sky that is the face of Father Uranus; no more is our land joined to the bones of Mother Gaia.  
  
  Now there is only a parchment dome above us, adorned with a painted mockery of the real sun. There is only a void about and below us. In every shadow, the demons wait for us, a hundred times more common than they were before. And if the gods can still hear us, they no longer raise up women to prophesy on their behalf as sibyls, nor have they answered our prayers for deliverance.  
  
  When light glowed through the lacy edges of the curtains, I gave up trying to sleep. My eyes felt swollen and gritty as I staggered to the window, but I ripped the curtains apart and squinted stubbornly at the sky. Just outside my window grew a pair of birch trees, and sometimes on windy nights their branches clattered against the panes of glass; but between their leaves I could see the hills, and three rays of the sun peeked over their dark silhouette.  
  
  The ancient poems, written before the Sundering, said that the sun—the true sun, chariot of Helios—was so bright it blinded all who looked upon it. They spoke of rosy-fingered Dawn, who painted the east in shades of pink and gold. They praised the boundless blue dome of the sky.  
  
  Not so for us. The wavy, golden rays of the sun looked like a gilt illumination in one of Father’s old manuscripts; they glinted, but their light was less painful than a candle. Once the main body of the sun was risen over the hillside, it would be uncomfortable to look upon, but no more than the frosted glass of a Hermetic lamp. For most of the light came from the sky itself, a dome of cream veined with darker cream, like parchment, through which light shone as if from a distant fire. Dawn was no more than the brighter zone of the sky rising above the hills, the light colder than at noon but otherwise the same.  
  
  “Study the sky but never love it,” Father had told Astraia and me a thousand times. “It is our prison and the symbol of our captor.”  
  
  But it was the only sky that I had ever known, and after today I would never walk beneath it again. I would be a prisoner in my husband’s castle, and whether I failed or succeeded in my mission—especially if I succeeded—there was no way I could ever escape those walls. So I stared at the parchment sky and the gilt sun while my eyes watered and my head ached.  
  
  When I was much younger, I sometimes imagined that the sky was an illustration in a book, that we were all nestled safely between the covers, and that if I could only find the book and open it, we would all escape without having to fight the Gentle Lord. I had gotten halfway to believing my fancy when I said to Father one evening, “Suppose the sky is really—” And he had asked me if I thought that telling fairy tales would save anyone.  
  
  In those days, I had still half believed in fairy tales. I had still hoped—not that I would escape my marriage but that first I could attend the Lyceum, the great university in the capital city of Sardis. I had heard about the Lyceum all my life, for it was the birthplace of the Resurgandi, the organization of scholars that was officially founded to further Hermetic research. I was only nine when Father told Astraia and me the secret truth: after receiving their charter, in the very deepest room of the Lyceum’s library, the first Magister Magnum and his nine followers swore a secret oath to destroy the Gentle Lord and undo the Sundering. For two hundred years, all the Resurgandi had labored toward that end.  
  
  But that was not why I longed to attend the Lyceum. I was obsessed with it because it was where scholars had first used Hermetic techniques to solve the shortages forced upon us by the Sundering. A hundred years ago, they had learnt to grow silkworms and coffee plants despite the climate and four times as fast as in nature. Fifty years ago, a mere student had discovered how to preserve daylight in a Hermetic lamp. I wanted to be like that student—to master the Hermetic principles and make my own discoveries, not just memorize the techniques Father thought useful—to achieve something besides the fate Father had given me. And I had calculated that if I completed every year’s worth of study in nine months, I could be ready by age fifteen, and I would have two years for the Lyceum before I had to face my doom.  
  
  I had tried telling Aunt Telomache about that idea, and she asked me witheringly if I thought that I had time to waste growing silkworms when my mother’s blood cried out for vengeance.  
  
  “Good morning, miss.”  
  
  The voice was barely more than a whisper. I spun around to see the door cracked open and my maid Ivy peeking through. Then my other maid, Elspeth, shoved past her and bustled into the room with a breakfast tray  
  
  There was no more time for regrets. It was time to be strong—if only my head would stop aching. I gratefully accepted the little cup of coffee and drank it down in three gulps, even the grounds at the bottom, then handed it back to Ivy and asked for another. By the time I finished the breakfast itself, I had drunk two more cups and felt ready to face the wedding preparations.  
  
  First I went down to the bathroom. Two years ago, Aunt Telomache had decorated it with potted ferns and purple curtains; the wallpaper was a pattern of clasped hands and violets. It felt like an odd place for the ceremonial cleansing, but Aunt Telomache and Astraia waited on either side of the claw-foot tub with pitchers. Last winter, Father had installed the new heated plumbing, but for the rite I had to be washed in water from one of the sacred springs; so I shivered as Aunt Telomache dumped ice-cold water over my head and Astraia chanted the maiden’s hymn.  
  
  In between verses, Astraia darted shy smiles at me, as if to check whether she was still forgiven. No, she wants to make sure you’re all right, I told myself, so I clenched my chattering teeth and smiled back. Whatever her concern, by the end of the ceremony she seemed entirely comforted; she sang out the last verse as if she wanted the whole world to hear, then threw a towel around my body and gave me a quick hug. As she rubbed me briskly with the towel, she stopped looking at my face. I thought, Finally, and let my aching smile slip.  
  
  Once I was dry and wrapped in a robe, we went to the family shrine. This part of the morning was comforting, for I had gone into this little room and knelt on the red-an  
d-gold mosaics a thousand times before. The musty, spicy smell of candle smoke and old incense sparked memories of childhood prayers: Father’s solemn face flickering in the candlelight, Astraia with her nose wrinkled and eyes squeezed shut as she prayed. Today the cold morning light already glimmered through the narrow windows; it glinted off the polished floor and made my eyes water.  
  
  First we prayed to Hermes, patron of our family and the Resurgandi. Then I cut off a lock of hair and laid it before the statue of Artemis, patron of maidens.  
  
  This time tomorrow I will not be a maiden. My mouth was dry and I stumbled over the prayer of farewell.  
  
  Next were the prayers to the Lares, the hearth gods who protect a home from sickness and bad luck, prevent grain from spoiling, and aid women in childbed. Our family had three of them, represented by three little bronze statues, their faces worn and green with age. Aunt Telomache laid a dish of olives and dried wheat before them, and I added another lock of hair, since I was leaving them behind: tonight I would belong to the Gentle Lord’s house and whatever Lares he might possess.  
  
  What gods would a demon serve, and what would I be required to offer them?  
  
  Finally we lit incense and laid a bowl of figs before the gilt-framed portrait of my mother. I bowed my face to the floor. I had prayed to her spirit a thousand times before, and the words rolled automatically through my head.  
  
  O my mother, forgive me that I do not remember you. Guide me on all the ways that I must walk. Grant me strength, that I may avenge you. You bore me nine months, you gave me breath, and I hate you.  
  
  The last thought slipped out as easily as breathing. I flinched, feeling as if I had shouted the words aloud, but when I glanced sideways at Astraia and Aunt Telomache, their eyes were still closed in prayer.  
  
  My stomach felt hollow. I knew that I should take the wicked words back. I should weep at the impiety I had shown to my mother. I should leap up and sacrifice a goat to atone for my sin.  
  
  My eyes burned, my knees ached, and every heartbeat carried me closer to a monster. My face stayed humbly pressed to the floor.  
  
  I hate you, I prayed silently. Father only bargained for your sake. If you had not been so weak, so desperate, I would not be doomed. I hate you, Mother, forever and ever.  
  
  Just thinking the words left me shaking. I knew it was wrong and my throat tightened with guilt, but before I could say anything else, Aunt Telomache dragged me to my feet and out of the room.  
  
  I’m sorry, I mouthed over my shoulder as I crossed the threshold. The morning light had left the statues and picture shadowed; from the doorway, I could no longer see the gods’ or my mother’s faces.  
  
  We went back up to my room, where the maids waited. Walking in, I caught a glimpse of Ivy’s face looking pale and pinched with worry—but the moment she saw me, she smiled hugely. Elspeth only gave me a bored look and opened the wardrobe. She drew out my wedding dress and whirled to face me, the dress’s red skirt swirling in a frothy wave.  
  
  “Your wedding dress, miss,” she said. “Isn’t it lovely?” Her smile was all bright teeth and wormwood.  
  
  Elspeth was peerless when it came to hair and wardrobes, but she performed every one of her duties with that harsh ironic smile. She hated the Resurgandi for being masters of the Hermetic arts yet never raising a hand against the Gentle Lord. She hated my father most of all, because it was his duty to offer the village’s tithe, the tribute of wine and grain that would persuade the Gentle Lord to leash his demons. Yet six years ago, though Father swore he made the offering correctly, her brother Edwin was found whimpering and trying to claw his skin off, his eyes the inky black of someone who had looked on demons and gone mad. She was glad to see me wed, because it meant that Leonidas Triskelion would lose someone just as dear.  
  
  I couldn’t blame her. She couldn’t know that for two hundred years, the Resurgandi had been secretly trying to destroy the Gentle Lord, any more than she could know how little Father would miss me. Like all the folk in the village, she knew only that Leonidas, the mighty Hermeticist, had bargained with the Gentle Lord like any common fool, and now, like any common fool, he must pay. It was justice; why shouldn’t she rejoice?  
  
  “It’s beautiful,” I murmured.  
  
  Ivy blushed as they dressed me, and the dress was worth blushing over: deep crimson like any other wedding dress, but far too gaudy and enticing. The skirt was a mass of ruffles and rosettes; the puffy sleeves left my shoulders bare, while the tight black bodice propped up my breasts and exposed them. There was no corset or shift underneath; they were dressing me so I could be stripped as quickly as possible.  
  
  Elspeth snickered as she buttoned up the front. “No use making a new husband wait, eh?”  
  
  I looked blankly at Aunt Telomache and she raised her eyebrows, as if to say, What did you expect?  
  
  “I’m sure he’ll fall in love with you at first sight,” said Ivy bravely. Her hands were shaking as she adjusted my skirt, so I managed to scrape up a smile for her. It seemed to calm her a little.  
  
  For the next few minutes, we all pretended that I was happy to marry. Elspeth and Ivy giggled and whispered; Astraia clapped her hands and hummed snatches of love songs; Aunt Telomache nodded, lips pursed in satisfaction. I stood quiet and compliant as a doll. If I stared very hard at the wall and reviewed the Hermetic sigils in my head, the bustle around me faded. I still noticed everything they did, but I didn’t have to feel much about it.  
  
  They combed my hair and pinned it up, hung rubies in my ears and around my neck, painted rouge on my lips and cheeks, and anointed my wrists and throat with musk. Finally they hustled me in front of the mirror.  
  
  A gleaming, crimson-clad lady stared back at me. Until this day, I had worn only the plain black of mourning, even though Father had told us when we were twelve that we could dress as we pleased. Everybody thought that I did it because I was such a pious daughter, but I simply hated pretending that everything was all right.  
  
  “You look like a dream.” Astraia slid her arm around my waist, smiling tremulously at our reflections.  
  
  Everybody said that Astraia was the very image of our mother, and certainly she could not have gotten her looks anywhere else: the plump, dimpled cheeks, the pouting lips, the snub nose and dark curls. But I might have been born straight out of my father’s head like Athena: I had his high cheekbones, his aristocratic nose, his straight black hair. In a rare burst of kindness, Aunt Telomache had once told me that while Astraia was “pretty,” I was “regal”; but everyone who saw Astraia smiled at her, while people only nodded at me and said my father must be proud.  
  
  Proud, yes. But not loving. Even when we were very young, it was clear that Astraia took after Mother, and I after Father. So there was never any question which one of us would pay for his sin.  
  
  Aunt Telomache clapped her hands. “That’s enough, girls,” she said. “Say good-bye and run along.”  
  
  Elspeth looked me up and down. “You look pretty enough to eat, miss. May the gods smile on your marriage.” She shrugged, as if to say it was no concern of hers, and left.  
  
  Ivy hugged me and slipped a little straw man into my hand. “It’s Brigit’s son, young Tom-a-Lone,” she whispered. “For luck.” She whirled away after Elspeth.  
  
  I crushed the charm in my hand. Tom-a-Lone was a hedge-god, the peasants’ lord of death and love. The village folk might sacrifice to Zeus or Hera sometimes, when custom demanded it, but for sick children, uncertain crops, and unrequited love, they prayed to the hedge-gods, the deities they had worshipped long before Romana-Graecian ships ever landed on their shores. Scholars agreed that the hedge-gods were merely superstition, or else garbled versions of the celestial gods—that Tom-a-Lone was but another form of Adonis, Brigit another name for Aphrodite—and that either way, the only rational course was to worship the gods under their true names.  
  
  Certainly the hedge-gods hadn’t saved Elspeth’s brother from the demons. But the gods of Olympus hardly seemed inclined to rescue me, either.  
  
  With a sigh, Aunt Telomache unfolded  
my fist and plucked out the crumpled Tom-a-Lone.  
  
  “Still they cling to their superstitions,” she muttered, and flung it into the fireplace. “You would think Romana-Graecia conquered them last week and not twelve hundred years ago.”  
  
  And from the way Aunt Telomache talked, you would think she was descended in a straight line from Prince Claudius, when in fact she and Mother came from a family that was only three generations removed from being peasants. But there was no use pointing that out to her.  
  
  “You don’t know,” Astraia protested. “It might bring good luck, after all.”  
  
  “And then the Kindly Ones will grant her three wishes, I suppose?” said Aunt Telomache, sounding more indulgent than annoyed. Then she turned a stony gaze on me. “I trust I don’t need to remind you how important this day is. But it is easy for the young to forget such things.”  
  
  No, it’s easy for you, I thought. Tonight you will fondle my father while I am the plaything of a demon.  
  
  “Yes, Aunt.” I looked down at my hands.  
  
  She sighed, eyelids drooping in preparation for another tender moment. “If only dear Thisbe—”  
  
  “Aunt,” said Astraia, who was now standing beside the chest of drawers. “Aren’t you forgetting something?” Her hands were behind her back, her smile as big and bright as the time she had eaten all the blackberry tarts.  
  
  “No, child—”  
  
  “So isn’t it lucky I remembered?” With a flourish, she pulled out from behind her back a slim steel knife hanging in a black leather harness.  
  
  For an instant, Aunt Telomache stared at the knife as if it were a big, fat spider. I felt as if I had swallowed that spider, as if it were crawling down my gullet with poisonous legs. That was how lying felt: all the lies I had swallowed and spat out again, vile and empty as the husks of dead insects, all for the sake of making sure that precious Astraia could stay happy. And this knife was the most important lie in our family.

1mnlnds,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mnlnds,Ninja creami Carnivorish recipe !,"Hi all! 👋
I’ve been strict carnivore for over a year now, but this summer my wife and I decided to treat ourselves to a Ninja Creami — and wow, it’s been a game changer! We've been making both fully carnivore and ""carnivorish"" ice cream recipes that fit well within our way of eating without derailing anything.

One of our favorite go-to recipes is super simple, low-carb, and absolutely delicious. I wanted to share it here in case anyone else is looking for an easy, indulgent treat that still keeps things clean:

🍨 Carnivorish Ice Cream (Ninja Creami)
Makes 1 jar — perfect to share (or not 😄)
Ingredients:

90g mascarpone
150ml water
Pinch of salt
30g Bulk Protein Powder (we rotate between vanilla, chocolate, and chocolate peanut)
Optional: 1 shot of espresso — amazing with vanilla to make a coffee flavor!

Macros (per jar):
Calories: 460 kcal
Fat: 37.2g
Carbs: 5g
Protein: 26.4g

We usually share a jar between the two of us, unless we’re going wild and each have our own 😅. It's obviously not 100% carnivore due to the protein powder, but it's low-carb and doesn’t affect how we feel or eat overall — so for us, it's close enough.

Hope someone finds this useful — and if you have your own Creami hacks or carnivore-friendly recipes, I’d love to hear them too!

My first order from them i spent more than half my prescription with them 11×10g bottles of milk and cookies testing at an awesome 38% and I tried 4×10g of their newest offering at thr time of pineapple marker #143. I also got a bunch of edibles to try. I was very happy with my order and the value of products I received. My 2nd order what a disaster! I loved the pineapple marker #143 but it was sold-out/restocking, BUT and a big but they had pineapple marker #87 available, same description as the #143, and I asked tilray chat staff 101 times is it the same? Is it similar? What's different about it compared to #143. I got bamboozled because they all lied and said its the same might be better. So I ordered 10×5g bottles and man its a completely different strain compared to #143. #143 was complex with gassy fuel notes with sweet tropical hints but screaming more gassy marker than fruity tropical pineapple. And me personally I can't consume fruity terps it makes me physically sick. So im stuck with 9 closed jars and one ugly open one. And thats not it! They highly recommended the coffee creamer saying if I loved the milk and cookies I'd love that too, the coffee creamer taste and smells like a mildewy old sock, I suspect most of this keif is mold. Oooooh wait thats not it! The 10 jars of platinum Pave i got which was the first thing I opned was full of mold and seed (b4 the seed junkies say anything it was unusbale white seeds) I was able to finally return the platinum pave- after a long transit because of the recent civic holiday. My replacement which i choose all milk and cookies because atm thats the only strain I can trust from tilray. So if your thinking of joining tilray I caution against it. They are all over the world, so in my opinion they let seeds and mold and liar tilray sales/chat members get thru medical bottles to us Canadians. But apparently you can now get broken coast products in Australia. To the share holders good for u! But to us Canadian patients. Get mold seeds, and cannbis that makes us physically sick.

	•	But I’m happy to hear recommendations from other neighborhoods if they’re worth the trip
	•	Good coffee is a big plus ☕
	•	Reliable internet (bonus points if there are outlets and it’s not super noisy)
	•	Indoor + outdoor seating options would be amazing

I don’t know if it was from drinking, the heat, or a stomach bug, but he missed the toilet.

He texted me while I was getting our LO ready for bed saying he’d vomited and needed help. About two hours later(after feeding the dogs and trying to get our 10mo to sleep) I went to our bedroom. He immediately told me he vomited and needed me to clean it up. I said I’d help disinfect after he cleaned the chunky part, but it would have to wait until morning because I needed to go back to the baby who was already screaming again… He didn’t respond and I left.

This morning, while making his coffee, he asked again if I could clean his bathroom. I asked if he’d done what I requested. He said no and that he wasn’t going to. I explained I can’t handle the chunky part without gagging, and we went in circles. Him telling me to just do it, me saying he needed to help, until he finally said “You need to figure it out. End of discussion” before going outside with his coffee.

Twenty minutes later, he came back in, led with “I love you” and asked again. When I still said no, he told me I had to do it and went to his office to work.

For context: I’ve cleaned up his bodily fluids before in the earlier years of our relationship (at least a handful of times), but since being pregnant and having our baby I’ve been firm that he cleans up after himself. I’m also a SAHM and take care of our child 24/7, even when he’s off work. Does cleaning your partner’s vomit really fall into those duties? 😭

Also, I peeked to see if I was being unreasonable and could just do it. No. Nope. Nopeeeeee. The sink had hardened chunky brown vomit. The toilet was covered in the same but thicker. I didn’t even check the wall or floor because I was already gagging.

And I was sad.
Not because I was single  
that was my choice 
but because the whole world seemed paired up,
and I… was just a lonely girl that day.

Then I heard it a loud thud behind me.
I turned and saw a man lying on the floor of the condo.
It should’ve been creepy, but it wasn’t.
I wasn’t planning to help him,
but the CCTV was there… and maybe I was just too bored to care.
So I did.
I helped him to the admin office,
and from there we brought him to the hospital.

When I got home, I thought that was it.
Until my doorbell rang.
It was him.
And instead of “thank you,” he asked,
“Bakit mo ginawa yun?”
I was shocked. Annoyed.
But he left as quickly as he came.

The next day, the guard told me he’d fainted from not eating all day.
And I thought, Well, that’s that.
Until I got a message on Facebook from him:
“Salamat. Sorry kung nasabihan kita ng ganun.”
I didn’t reply.
I just sent a like reaction and left it at that.

We didn’t talk after that.
Until one night… the elevator doors opened.
It was him.
I heard him said sungit.
But I didnt bother to say any

A few weeks later
I was outside again, smoking,
just passing the time because I couldn’t sleep.
He pulled up in his car.
“Bakit andito ka pa”
We talk a bit
“Gusto mo kape na lang tayo para din makabawi ako”
And somehow… that turned into coffee.

Coffee turned into talks.
Talks turned into late-night drives.
Sometimes nowhere in particular 
just driving, music in the background,
two people keeping each other company
in the middle of their own sadness.

We started talking every day.
Messages from morning until night.
Small updates.
Late-night conversations when I couldn’t sleep.
It felt like a genuine friendship.
But somehow I question myself.

Normal friendship shouldn’t be like this on a daily basis?
I started to feel like maybe he liked me.

but because of the way he’d show up,
the way he’d listen,
the way he’d look at me a little too long.

He told me about his heartbreak 
how his long-term girlfriend cheated on him.
I listened.
And maybe… I got used to being that person for him.

Months passed like that.
No destination, just music and short talks.
When we got back to the condo, we stayed in the car for a while.

Then he said,
“I like you.”

I froze.
I felt this sudden rush in my chest 
the kind where you want to smile but stop yourself.

But my mind was louder than my heart.
Because yes, I liked him.
Maybe more than I admitted to myself.

He was the kind of person I kept looking for without knowing 
but also the kind of person I was scared to lose once I had him.

I cared for him in a way I hadn’t cared for anyone before.
Maybe because he was the saddest person I had ever met, really.
And I didn’t want to be the one to add to that sadness. 
That moment I just want to be his friend naawa ako sa kanya.

I was afraid that if we crossed that line,
and it didn’t work out,
I’d hurt him 
and that was the last thing I wanted.

I wanted to say yes the answer he’d love to hear.
So I told him, “I’ll think about it. I’ll message you tonight.”


When I got from my unit, I stared at my phone for a long time.
My fingers hovered over the keyboard for a long time.

I kept typing and deleting,
wanting to write the answer he hoped for,
but my courage kept slipping away

I was a weakling
I typed, “I think we’re better off as friends.”

The moment I pressed send,
it felt like giving away something I wanted to keep
because I was afraid I might break it if I held on too long.

The truth?
I liked him too.

I was still in my 20s,
still figuring out what I wanted in life.
I didn’t even know what direction I was going.
My days felt like trial and error,
and I didn’t want to build something so important
on a foundation I wasn’t sure of.
I was confused,
and in a strange way,
that confusion made me sad.
Because here I was, liking someone so much,
but not trusting myself enough to choose him.

He’s at his 30s, he’s established.
Got a great career 
all the means in his life.
I can say he’s successful 
But he didn’t have a family
He didnt have friends,
His friends have built families
Lahat ng nasa paligid niya ginagamit lang resources niya
He’s alone in his life. 
Ayokong isipin niya na user lang ako, na mayaman siya kaya ako nag stay

And I didn’t want to be the rebound.

He didnt replied, like me 
He was a weakling too

And then I relocated 
not to escape him,
but because it was already planned.
Before I met him
Still… it made forgetting hard.

1 Year passed.
Sometimes, memories pulled me back
to somewhere only we know.

(If we had a minute, maybe we could have gone there,
talked about it, somewhere only we know)

But that place was never meant to last 
just a moment,
I still missed him
I was about to message him.
I want to try and leave the overthinking
And just say I like him too 
Maybe it will kill my what ifs
 
But when I searched his profile…

there she was.
His ex.
They were back together.

I froze.
It wasn’t jealousy that hit me first 
it was anger.
Because everything I said,
every advice I gave,
Parang Gago lang…
parang nabaliwala.
Matapos niya isuka.
Okay sana kung ibang babae na lang.
Pero siya pa rin.
The same girl who broke him.

And I thought,
Maybe I was right.
Maybe I was just the rebound.

Still, I moved on
For 7yrs years, 
I found love.
Real love.
The kind that makes you sure.
The kind that makes you feel safe.

Pero minsan, may mga sandali pa rin,
na parang may multo na dumadaan sa isip ko.
Not because I wanted him back 
but because some people stay with you,
even if they’re no longer part of your life.

Parang multo na hindi ka tinatakot,
pero tahimik na nananatili sa sulok ng isip mo.

Years passed.
I got engaged.
Randomly I bumped into my spam
I found out his checking up on me years ago
I don’t know how he found out,
or how he knew I had a boyfriend,
since my Facebook profile was set to private.


He said, “I’m happy for you.”

He didn’t message often — only from time to time —
always checking in,
always asking, “When will you get married?”
Always telling me he was happy for me.

But his words…
they still carried that quiet sadness beneath.

I replied 
“Engaged pa lang last week, invited ka haha!” 
I kept my replies short and simple,
because I knew deep down I was happy now.
Happy with the life I was building,
happy with the person I chose to be with.

But every time I read his messages,
there was this small voice inside me 
the “what if” — whispering,
wondering about the path not taken.

Still, I didn’t want to open that door again.
I didn’t want to invite confusion or doubt
into the happiness I had finally found.

Now I’m engaged.
He sent his congratulations.
I laughed softly not because it was funny,
but because I didn’t know how else to respond.


Meanwhile, he’s still with the same girl 
the one who broke him before.
Still not married.
Still lost in the same pain that I helped him carry,
while I’m trying to build a future.

And that sting 
knowing I’m moving forward
while he’s still stuck where we once were 
it aches in a way words as a friend that cared too much

And that’s where our story ends.

Ghost
a gentle presence in the corner of my mind.
Not scary, not haunting 
just there, a reminder of a time when we found each other,

We were proof that you can be important to someone,
even if you’re not meant to be theirs.

We were, for a moment,
two less lonely people in the world.",4,1754937924.0,AlasFeels,3,0.84,False

Once we hit 10 upvotes, I’ll upload the link for everyone.","Twenty-two-year-old virgin Mikaela Wallace has been the perfect daughter her entire life-until her billionaire father announces her engagement to a stranger at her own birthday party. Faced with an arranged marriage or total financial ruin, Mikaela discovers the ultimate rebellion: auctioning her virginity online for nearly half a million dollars. It's the perfect plan to buy her freedom with the one thing Daddy values most. But when she arrives at the hotel room, the mysterious buyer waiting for her isn't a stranger. It's the one person whose betrayal would destroy her father completely. Now Mikaela must choose: walk away with her carefully constructed life intact, or surrender to the forbidden desire that could give her everything she's ever wanted... and cost her everything she's ever known.

POV Mikaela

There's a special circle of hell called ""turning twenty-two at Le Bernardin while Manhattan's elite assess your market value.""

I'm the birthday girl who gets no wishes, no song, no candles.

Just appraising glances from people who think my virginity is still a commodity worth investing in.

Twenty-two and never been fucked, and not just literally, but figuratively too. Because daddy's security team has cockblocked every potential experience since puberty hit.

The irony? I probably know more about sex than half of these married socialites, thanks to the Kindle stashed inside my hollow copy of ""Women in Economics.""

Three hundred and twelve steamy novels later, and I'm still trapped in this display case, untouched and pristine like some collector's item nobody's allowed to play with.

That's when I see him—a man I've never spotted at my father's gatherings before.

Dark hair kissed with silver, jawline sharp enough to slice through bullshit, watching the room with barely concealed disdain.

He's older, maybe late thirties, but radiates something these other corporate zombies lack: actual fucking life force.

His eyes meet mine for exactly three heartbeats, and the oxygen molecules between us spontaneously combust.

Before I can process what just happened, he's standing, murmuring something to my father, then striding toward the exit with his phone pressed to his ear.

Emergency call or convenient escape?

Either way, he's gone, leaving me weirdly breathless and suddenly aware of how boring everyone else is.

""Smile, Mikaela,"" mother hisses through her veneers. ""The Andersons are watching.""

Watch me perform my greatest trick: transforming into Perfect Daughter™ in 0.5 seconds.

Eyes warm but not inviting. Smile pleasant but not provocative. My emerald dress (mother-selected, obviously) shows just enough skin to prove I have it, not enough to suggest I might enjoy using it.

I'm basically a walking prospectus with tits—amazing potential returns, minimal risk, zero agency.

""Christ, these people's egos are so massive they should charge them for extra seating,"" Josie muttered, barely moving her lips behind her glass. ""Happy birthday, by the way. How's it feel having your special day weaponized into a networking event?""

A laugh shot up my throat that I suffocated into a polite cough.

Josie had saved my sanity since prep school, the only human who could x-ray through my perfect-daughter bullshit and see the handcuffs underneath.

""Mrs. Wallace, you've done a remarkable job with your daughter,"" said Mr. Covington. ""Such poise, such grace. They don't make young ladies like this anymore.""

I felt my soul crumble a little more as mother beamed. ""Thank you, Edward. We've always believed proper upbringing is essential.""

Proper upbringing.

As if my life had been anything other than a carefully curated performance to reflect well on Gunther Wallace's empire.

I'd never dated, never attended a school dance, never worked. I'd been dressed, educated, and molded into the perfect accessory.

Perfect virgin-wife material.

""Excuse me,"" I murmured, standing abruptly. ""I need to freshen up.""

The restaurant bathroom was mercifully empty when I pushed through the door, gripping the marble countertop as I stared at my reflection.

Behind me, the door banged open.

""You're about thirty seconds from a full psychological break in Chanel,"" Josie announced.

""I'm suffocating,"" I whispered, voice splintering like cheap glass. ""Twenty-two fucking years and I've never breathed non-filtered, non-approved air. My birthday gift? Not even actual stock certificates—just a goddamn trust fund statement for money I can't touch until I'm practically menopausal.""

""Listen up,"" Josie leaned in, all business. ""Tomorrow night, I'm kidnapping your ass. We're hitting real clubs with real music and real humans who don't calculate bloodlines before making eye contact.""

For one electric second, I saw it—freedom sprawled before me like some wild, unmapped continent.

My chest constricted with a want so savage it felt like cardiac arrest.

Then reality crashed down like a designer anvil. Two decades of premium conditioning crushed that spark with terrifying efficiency.

""I can't,"" I whispered, hating the wobble in my voice, hating more the sick relief underneath my disappointment. ""Remember last time? The security team? The financial guillotine?""

My fingers whitened against marble, bones threatening to pierce skin.

""Coffee tomorrow. Somewhere sanitized.""

Josie's expression collapsed, and there it was—the thing I couldn't stomach—pure fucking pity. She grabbed my hand; I let her, shame scorching me alive.

""Sure, coffee works,"" she said gently, which was somehow worse than anger. She understood my pathetic surrender without judgment, a kindness I hadn't earned.

When we rejoin the table, I freeze.

The mystery man is back, now seated at my father's right hand.

Up close, he's even more devastating—confident in a way that comes from actually living life instead of just accumulating wealth.

""Ah, Mikaela, there you are,"" my father says, irritated by my absence. ""I'd like you to meet Caleb O'Brien, an old friend and business associate of mine. Caleb, my daughter.""

So that's who he is.

The pieces click into place as I note my father's hand clapping Caleb's shoulder—a gesture of familiarity rarely extended in Father's tightly controlled world.

Though clearly younger than my father by several years, the subtle lines around Caleb's eyes speak of experience, of a life fully lived beyond boardrooms and balance sheets.

God, he’s gorgeous.

Caleb stood, towering at least ten inches above me. He extended a hand, his voice low and confident.

""Hello, Mikaela. Last time I saw you, you were in pigtails hiding behind your mother's legs. I have to say, the years between then and now have been... generous.""

His eyes swept over me—not crude, but thorough. Like he was cataloguing every detail, every change from that pigtailed kid to whatever I'd become.

For exactly three seconds, he looked at me like a man looking at a woman who claimed his attention.

Then he caught himself. Blinked. Shifted back into polite family friend mode so smoothly I almost convinced myself I'd imagined it.

Almost.

My hand trembled in his for the briefest moment, heat crawling up my neck at the simple contact and his compliment.

""Thank you,"" I murmured.

But I couldn't stop looking at him. Throughout dinner, my eyes kept finding their way back to Caleb.

Every smile, every low rumble of his laugh, every glance in my direction made my chest tighten in unfamiliar ways. He wasn't trying to belong, he simply did.

""She's been raised properly,"" Mr. Hennington was saying. ""A real lady. The kind of girl who understands her place in society.""

I felt my smile calcifying on my face as I nodded graciously, dying inside.

""If another man calls you 'a real lady,' I'm baptizing him with Cabernet,"" Caleb murmured, mouth dangerously close to my ear.

A strangled laugh escaped me—social suicide—triggering my mother's laser-beam glare. Caleb's eyes crinkled at the corners, fucking delighted by my lapse.

Later, during an excruciating conversational drought, he leaned in again. ""These corporate feeding frenzies—your thing?""

My lips twitched, still high from his earlier rebellion. ""Only when I'm the prize being auctioned off,"" I deadpanned.

Caleb burst into a surprised laugh, genuine and warm. It was the first time anyone at the table had reacted to me as more than a trophy.

The moment hung between us, electric but brief.

When Father stood, champagne flute in hand, I finally relaxed. Birthday toast, perfunctory acknowledgment of my existence, then dessert and freedom—at least the limited version available to me.

""I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on this special occasion,"" Father began, his commanding voice silencing all conversation. ""Today we not only celebrate my daughter's twenty-second birthday but also a momentous announcement.""

I froze, confusion replacing relief.

""It gives me great pleasure to announce the engagement of my daughter, Mikaela, to Anthony Harris, heir to Harris Financial. Our families will be united this fall in what promises to be the social event of the season.""

The world tilted sideways.

Engagement? Anthony Harris? I'd never even met him.

As applause erupted around me, I turned slightly to my right where Caleb sat beside me.

The proximity was sudden torture, every molecule between us charged with something I couldn't name but felt like drowning.

His smile was gone, replaced by a jaw clenched tight enough to crack stone. His grip on the wine glass was so severe I could see the blood retreating from his knuckles, leaving them bone-white against the crystal.

Something dark and unforgiving flickered in his eyes when he looked at my father as if he saw him for the first time, before they met mine.

A flash so brief I might have imagined it, but it seared through the numbness spreading inside me like a poison.

At that moment, I realized I wasn't just a daughter.

I was a commodity which had just been sold.",1,1754937863.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

Hello! My partner and I are subletting our beloved apartment in the heart of the **Lower East Side** — just one block from the **Delancey/Essex FMJZ subway stop** — and we’re looking for someone to enjoy it while we temporarily relocate for work.

We’ve lived here together for 4 years (and I’ve called this home for over 9!). It’s truly a gem: full of character, flooded with light, and perfectly located to take advantage of everything downtown Manhattan has to offer. We’re only moving because my partner, a special education teacher, accepted a position in Connecticut for the upcoming school year.

We have a great relationship with our long-term landlord and are looking for responsible tenants to sublet while we’re away. Here’s what makes the apartment special:

* **2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom** in a classic **pre-war walk-up** (2nd floor – just one straight flight up!)
* **King-size primary bedroom** fits a king bed, dresser, two nightstands, desk, and an armchair — plus a large closet with overhead storage
* **Second bedroom** fits a queen bed and dresser, has a deep closet — could also be used as a **home office or guest room**
* **Spacious living/dining room** fits a 6-person dining table, sectional sofa, armchairs, coffee table, and TV console
* **Updated kitchen** with tons of cabinetry, a dedicated pantry, and newer appliances (all replaced within the last 4 years)
* **High ceilings** and **southeast-facing windows** that flood the apartment with natural light
* **Window planters** outside the living room — perfect for growing herbs or seasonal flowers!
* Only **1 block from the Delancey/ Essex FMJZ** subway stop, and right in the middle of the best restaurants, bars, shopping, and entertainment the city has to offer
* Within **5-10 minute walking distance** of **Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, Essex Market, and Union Market**
* **Laundromat** right across the street
* Will be **unfurnished**
* **No pets**

Please DM me if interested and we can set up a video chat.

We usually do daily walks if it’s not too hot, and she handles it well, she might fuss 20 minutes in, which is when the walk is usually over anyway. But going to a store or coffee shop can be a hit or miss. What bothers me the most is that I feel like I’m going out because my in laws keep telling me “to get out”, whether it’s for my own sanity or for the baby, I don’t know. Two times we’ve taken her out, she starts to wail in the car seat then calms down, then once we get into the store she starts wailing again unless she’s held and it’s just so stressful for me. My sister in law makes me feel worse by asking “have you taken her out by yourself yet, I used to take my baby out all the time to get used to it” and then my mother in law will always ask “where did you go today!”. Ugh it just makes me feel like shit that I’m not taking her out enough. My husband is amazing and tells me all that matters is our daughter and how we raise her is no one else’s business. He has been SO supportive and I am so thankful for him, it truly feels like parenting duties are 50/50. Even with me EBF, he always makes sure I’m fed, hydrated, gives me time to go work out every day, etc. With that said, my mental health is pretty good, I’m eating well, working out daily, sleeping great because LO is a fantastic sleeper, but the only thing is I feel like my in laws are guilt tripping in not going out all the time. LO is doing great in my eyes, she eats well, plays well, of course she has her fussy moments but I just don’t think it’s worth the stress of taking her out just for the sake of taking her out at this age. And when I do, she ends up getting crankier, and her naps for that day are so crap. My husbands cousin also has a newborn and they tend to go more out and about with him and I feel like I’m being compared to them. Also my SIL and my husbands cousin both have so much family help, whereas we don’t because we live far. 

Anyways.. I just I needed to vent because it makes me wonder am I doing my child a disservice by not taking her out all the time because I get anxiety of her temperament when going out especially when I feel like there is no need to go out?",1,1754937752.0,newborns,3,1.0,False
1mnldt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Aeneidian/comments/1mnldt5/the_hidden_catch_with_google_ads_negative_keywords/,The Hidden Catch with Google Ads Negative Keywords,"One thing you have to know is that Google’s negative match types don’t behave like your regular keyword match types, they still function based on the old, strict/tight match typing back-end. So if you're wondering why negatives keep coming back after negativing them, this small essay/post might help give you some new ideas.

If you’re DIYing your ads account or run ads for clients, you likely know that negativing search terms is one of the main levers for keeping campaign CPAs healthy and wasted spend at bay. Negativing is how you keep a campaign focused on the search cluster(s) you intended it to be in, without it drifting into other clusters, or worse, other campaigns you’re running.

`Why would you not want a campaign to drift into another campaign? Well, that other campaign, ideally, has its own ads and offers dialed into those specific searches, and yields better earnings per click than your accidental mistargeted campaign would. The rule of thumb is to not buy placements that you aren't intentionally going after. You have to know what you advertise on.`

For example, in lead gen, especially local lead gen (e.g., HVAC, plumbing, solar, roofing, tree care, restoration, remodeling), one type of query you might want to filter out are competitor search placements.

Now, you *can* run competitor campaigns to scoop up people shopping around (say, someone looking for a second opinion on a pricey HVAC install). But you generally don’t want competitor names showing up in your cold prospecting campaigns.

`Note on competitor campaigns, skip this if you're not interested in running any: if you do run them, you have to be very cognizant of who you’re trying to pull over. Most competitor searches are from people trying to reach that business directly, booking, following up, confirming times. But a small slice can be persuaded if your ad hits the right trigger point: cheaper quotes, better service, or installing a premium system for a fixed rate. There has to be some hook you uncover from competitor reviews or other types of competitive research or your own knowledge about the niche. That hook is the difference between a competitor campaign that works… and one filled with people who accidentally called you instead of the other guy or gal.`

Cold prospecting campaigns aren’t competitor campaigns, they need their own, intentional search clusters. Just like brand-defense campaigns aren't prospecting campaigns. Nothing is more confusing than opening an “Air Conditioning Repair” campaign and seeing 80% competitor queries and 20% unrelated, low-intent queries. It by default becomes something different than it labels itself to be. Whereas if 80% was AC repair searches and its closely correlated variants, and only 20% or less is miscellaneous/less wanted, it would be much *easier* for you to read the campaign’s performance and know that the performance is tied to what the campaign identifies itself to be. *Moreover, with a campaign that targets what it intends to target, you can actually assess performance on the keyword level, rather than on the search query level.* It's robust experimental design, or in plain English, good housekeeping.

The same logic applies to all other niches, not just HVAC. If you’re running a tree removal campaign, you probably don’t want “tree maintenance” or “stump removal” queries in there, unless you’ve deliberately decided to consolidate all services into one campaign because search volume is low in your market.

Sure, you can make campaigns more targeted by tightening keyword match types, like going from broad to phrase, or phrase -> exact. But you can also make them more targeted by *negativing better* and by understanding negative keyword match types.

And this is where people get tripped up: negatives in Google Ads still use the old matching rules, the ones from before match types got “loosened.” They don't function like how you would intuitively think they would, nor do they function like how regular keywords do.

Pre-2020, for regular keywords, exact match meant *exact match*. Phrase match meant minor variations. Broad match meant moderate variations, but still frequently contained the original keyword.

Example:

* Exact match \[oak tables\] would buy placements on “oak table” (plus singular, misspellings, and other character mutations).
* Phrase match ""oak tables"" would buy placements on ""oak table"", “buy oak tables,” “cheap oak tables.”, and everything exact match encompasses.
* Broad match oak tables would buy placements on “oak table,” “table made of oak,” “round oak dining table,” “antique oak kitchen table,” “solid oak side table,” “furniture oak wood table,” “large farmhouse oak table.”, and so on.

Today, exact match gets you not just “oak tables,” but also “solid wood dining tables,” “oak coffee table,” “wooden tables”, i.e., synonyms, rewordings, and implied meanings, almost like the old broad match. And now, broad match buys placements on the entire category, not just the keyword. You’d see searches like  “wooden dining furniture,” “rustic farmhouse furniture,” and “IKEA table sets”. You've *deviated* from the original search keyword my a significant order of magnitude.

Here’s the tricky bit, when you add keywords, Google uses this *new* loose-matching logic. But when you add *negative* keywords, Google still uses the *old* strict-matching logic.

That means your negatives are applied narrowly, even if you enter them as broad match negatives. So you can build a negative list with hundreds of keywords and still see competitor variants or unrelated queries sneaking in.

The tricky bit is when you add negative keywords via the Google Ads interface, it by default sets those negatives to exact match. Which as you now understand, means exact match as it used to be. Minor misspellings, singular/plural, and that's about it. Not modern day exact match.

The simplest fix? Negative with phrase match. If you don’t want “car AC repair” showing up, don’t negative it as exact match, negative it as phrase match. Do the same for competitor names and for any search cluster you want entirely gone from that campaign. Include all variants you see, and incrementally filter out undesired search clusters. You can use broad match keywords too, but you'll need to be more careful, as you can over-negative that way, which can backfire.

1mnldek,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1mnldek/60_days_of_daily_reading_fixed_my_brain_more_than/,60 days of daily reading fixed my brain more than any wellness trend ever did,"A few months ago, I came home from work, collapsed on my bed, and did what I always did: opened TikTok. “Just 10 minutes to decompress,” I told myself. An hour later, my eyes were burning, my brain felt like static, and my to-do list was still untouched. I wasn’t relaxed. I was numb. My focus was shot, my sleep was trash, and every spare moment felt like it needed to be filled with scrolling.

It scared me when I realized I couldn’t remember the last time I’d read a full book. And yet, every successful person I admire talks about two habits: reading and moving their body daily. I wanted in, but the gap between where I was and who I wanted to be felt impossible.

Then I read Atomic Habits. One line hit me like a truck: “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.” I didn’t need to fix my whole life overnight. I just needed to tweak the system.

So I ran an experiment:
– 10-minute walk after dinner.
– One short workout a week if I felt like it.
– Replace TikTok with 15 minutes of reading every
    night.

I even swapped the TikTok icon with my reading app so my muscle memory worked for me. I also started stacking audiobooks with stuff I already did, while cleaning, commuting, even in the shower.

The first week was brutal. I still caught myself unlocking my phone and tapping the empty spot where TikTok used to be. But somewhere around week three, the cravings started to fade. My brain stopped needing micro-dopamine hits from 10-second videos. Stories and ideas began to feel more satisfying than swipes.

After 60 days, I’d finished 8 books (I’d read 2 total last year), my attention span doubled, and my mind felt…quiet. Like I could hear my own thoughts again.

Here’s what actually worked for me (learned from trial, error, and some therapist-approved habit science):
 –Swap the cue, not just the habit. Replacing an
    app in the exact spot your brain expects it is a
    cheat code.
 –Read fun, short stuff first. Lower friction, build
   momentum.
 –Stack habits. Pair reading with tea, skincare, or
    your commute.
 –Audiobooks = still reading. Ignore the purists.
 –Make the book impossible to miss. Desk,
    nightstand, or even as your lock screen.
 –Track books finished, not hours read.
 –Achievement triggers dopamine.
 –Don’t expect instant miracles. Your brain needs
    ~21–60 days to recalibrate dopamine pathways.
–Some resources that helped me massively (besides therapy):

During this time, I read some great books to rebuild my focus, and surprisingly, made me actually enjoy learning again. Starting with Atomic Habits by James Clear – NYT bestseller, 10M+ copies sold. Clear distills habit science into strategies you can actually stick to. This book will make you see motivation in a totally new way. Another must-read is Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport – from the author of Deep Work. This will make you rethink your entire tech diet. I closed Instagram for a week right after reading it. Game changer. I also highly recommend The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle – 5M+ copies sold, spiritual classic. This book will make you realize how much of your anxiety is controlling you.

When it comes to tools, BeFreed has been a game changer for me. A friend introduced me to this smart reading app built by scientists from Columbia U and I’m hooked. You can choose between quick 10 or 20 minute summaries or full 40 minute deep dives and even customize your reading host’s voice and tone (mine has that smoky Samantha from Her vibe, dangerously addictive). It creates a personalized learning roadmap based on your goals, struggles, and how your brain works. I’ve been knocking out books on discipline, psychology, and investing while walking or making coffee. I never thought I’d crave reading, but it gives me the same dopamine hit as scrolling and now I’m hooked on knowledge instead.

Another helpful app is Forest, where you plant a virtual tree that grows as you stay off your phone. It’s weirdly effective when paired with 15–20 minute reading sessions. And for movement, MadFit (YouTube) is my go-to: low effort, high reward workouts that pair perfectly with an audiobook. I’ve “read” whole books while doing her 20-min routines.

Replacing social media with reading didn’t just make me “productive”, it gave me back my ability to think clearly. Big tech platforms are literally engineered to hijack your dopamine system: infinite scroll, autoplay, notifications timed for max re-engagement. Over time, this rewires your brain to crave constant novelty and kills your ability to focus deeply. Reading reverses that. It forces you to slow down, follow a narrative, and rebuild your mental endurance.

If you feel stuck, burnt out, or like your attention span is fried, this is your sign. Start with one page. One paragraph. One short story before bed. You’re not broken; your brain just needs a different diet. The smartest, happiest people I know all have two habits: they read daily, and they move daily. Build that system for yourself, and watch who you become.

Chapter 6 Who Am I?

""Good afternoon, sir. I'm Tina.""

I forced down my panic and turned around, responding with professional composure.

I had mentally prepared myself, keeping my expression calm without any sign of distress—just a practiced, professional smile.

Until I looked up and saw the man's face clearly. Then my professional smile cracked.

If running into Oliver had already made me consider quitting this job, then seeing this person made me wonder if I should pack up and move to a different city entirely.

The man looking at me had curiosity written all over his face.

Makes sense. I knew him, but he didn't know me.

My ex-fiancé.

Long time no see, Aron Fox.

Perhaps he captured the instant of disbelief in my eyes, because Aron pressed further for no apparent reason.

""Ms. Tina, if you don't mind me asking, what's your last name? I have this feeling we've met somewhere before.""

I flashed him a bright smile and looked up at Aron.

""Tina Granger. And sir, rather than being hit on like this, I'd prefer you just ask me out for coffee.""

Aron chuckled awkwardly and didn't push any further.

""So, what do you think? Are you satisfied with this place? I specifically saved lucky number 7 for you. You can't say I'm not looking out for my buddy.""

Oliver walked over and gave Aron a big hug.

Right. This was exactly why I needed to stay away from Oliver—he was my ex-fiancé Aron's best friend.

And me? I'm Tina Granger, formerly Tina Lopez, and before that, briefly Tina Garcia.

That's right—Garcia as in the Garcia Family.

My father, Dylan Lopez, is the current CEO of Garcia Group.

Ten years ago, he abandoned his mother and daughter to marry Helen Garcia.

Five years ago, using my grandmother's medical bills as leverage, he forced me to represent the Garcia Family in an arranged business marriage with the Lopez Family.

Later, Aron Lopez rejected this loveless arrangement, the engagement was called off, and I was promptly kicked to the curb.

Wanting nothing more to do with Mr. Lopez, I changed my name to Tina Granger, taking my grandmother's maiden name, and we moved to New York because it had the best medical facilities.

While the two men chatted, I tactfully returned to the lobby to finish my last day of work.

I knew that whether I'd actually receive that commission was entirely up to Oliver now.

The big client was Aron, so the deal closing was practically guaranteed.

I stood in the lobby, saw off the last customer of the day, and finished my final shift.

Karen approached me, her expression filled with worry and concern.

""Tina, do you want me to come upstairs with you to apologize to Mr. Melville? It's really hard to find part-time work with benefits this good. Don't do something you'll regret.""

""Karen, I've already made up my mind. Since it's my last day, dinner's on me. I'll text you the address. See you there.""

I wasn't interested in judging whether Karen's gesture was genuine or fake—it didn't matter. What mattered was that after I filled out my resignation form and submitted it to the shift supervisor, I quietly slipped away while the lobby was still bustling with people.

Soon after, supervisor Kirk Reed arrived at the bar address I'd sent them, with Karen in tow.

""Nice taste. How'd you find this place?""

I closed my menu and pushed it across the table.

""I didn't find it—a friend brought me here once.""

Karen flipped through the menu a few times before quickly handing it over to Kirk, knowing she couldn't afford this place.

At least she was self-aware enough to pass off the ordering responsibility. After all, she wasn't paying, so she figured she'd let the host decide.

""One order of pork ribs, seared foie gras, tomahawk steak, three mojitos—""

Seeing that Kirk showed no signs of stopping, I cut him off.

""Mr. Reed, I don't have any beef with you, do I? Are you seriously trying to bankrupt me with one meal? This is my last day—I'm practically broke.""

Kirk wasn't fazed. He just called the server over and added three more orders of mushroom bisque before he was satisfied.

Sensing my exasperation, he didn't even look up as he tapped his glass.

""Someone who's about to receive a big bonus can't afford a little dinner? And here I was being so accommodating during your resignation process today.""

The irritation on my face quickly faded. ""You really think Oliver will credit me for that sale?""

""If he was planning to stiff you, he wouldn't have let you know who the big client was. The moment Mr. Lopez went upstairs, that bonus became yours.""

""You know Mr. Lopez too?""

""If I didn't know Mr. Lopez, would I be enjoying this expensive dinner you're buying? Thanks for working so hard to butter me up—even dragging along this clueless girl.""

Kirk leaned back slightly and glanced dismissively at Karen, who clearly hadn't caught the subtext of our conversation.

""Don't be so paranoid. I invited Karen because we're friends.""

""Right, I'm sure it has nothing to do with her being my sister, which is why you've been covering for her at work and cleaning up her messes.""

Karen, who had been afraid to speak up until now, finally realized I'd known about her relationship with Kirk all along.

She stared at me wide-eyed, wondering where she'd given herself away. She and Kirk had different last names because their parents divorced when they were young, and they each took their respective parent's surname. Nobody was supposed to know they were siblings.

""The shift schedules. I'm good at observing patterns. When I noticed that most of Karen's part-time shifts had Kirk as the supervisor, I started paying closer attention to you two.""

I picked up a dinner roll from the table, spread it with butter using the knife, and handed it to Karen.

Karen automatically took the roll and bit into it without thinking.

After months of working together, she'd gotten used to me taking care of her like this.

Kirk couldn't stand watching anymore. He picked up the water pitcher and poured glasses for both of us.

""Stop spoiling this girl. Look at her—she's visibly put on weight since you started feeding her. If she can't pass the appearance standards next quarter, I'll be the one stuck supervising her diet.""

""With you being Oliver's right-hand man, I'm sure you can protect her.""

Exactly. Once I figured out Karen and Kirk's close relationship, I started playing the long game—taking care of Karen to get closer to Kirk.

Kirk was smart too. After multiple instances of me covering for Karen's mistakes, my shift assignments gradually became identical to Karen's. I managed to avoid all the night and early morning shifts, comfortably earning my paycheck on the evening shift.

I had it all planned out perfectly. After getting converted to full-time, I was going to reduce my weekend modeling gigs. Who could have predicted Oliver would lose his mind and come down to mess with the staff?

Still, if I really was getting that $50,000 bonus, I couldn't complain. I'd hoped for it from the beginning, but never felt certain.

So after spending two hours at the hospital with Grandma, I invited the Reed siblings out for dinner. Kirk had been with Oliver since before he took over Melville Group. While he wasn't part of Oliver's inner circle like his secretary or driver, he'd definitely figured out his personality. If Kirk agreed with my assessment, then I could really count on that $50,000.

""Don't get too cocky. Fifty grand is nice, but it'll only last you about six months. You need to think about what you're doing next.""

Kirk cut his steak methodically while casually giving me this final piece of advice.",1,1754937693.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Right. This was exactly why I needed to stay away from Oliver—he was my ex-fiancé Aron's best friend.

**Accommodations/Location**

We stayed on the French side in Cul de Sac in an AirBnB managed by Villaway. It was right on the water and far enough south from the ferry dock that we didn't really have to deal with sargassum at the house. Some mornings we'd have to wade through a bit when we went out on the kayaks but rarely did we smell the decomposing stuff further up into the bay.

Cul de Sac is a great location with easy access to Orient Bay and Grand Case, with the Super U grocery store and Wine Grapes wine shop close by and great.

We did realize a couple of days in that my wife is very sensitive to the smell/gases released by the sargassum, so we mostly steered clear (as you'll see below)

**Beaches**

**Orient Bay:** We were originally going to spend the day at Orient Bay one day, but when we stopped down the day before, there was sargassum along the beach, so we decided to mostly stick to the west side of the island.

**Pinel Island:** The exception was our day on Pinel at Karibuni. The sargassum smell was horrific on the ferry dock side, but once we got over to Pinel we only smelled it here and there. It's a beautiful, quiet spot, with great food and drinks (and service at Karibuni -- thanks Sam!). The water is calm and shallow.

One note: the ferry schedule you may see online or elsewhere is more a guideline than anything. We got there for the first run and the captain said it wasn't leaving until 30 minutes after we had been told. Not a big problem though. The returning schedule seemed pretty much up to the captain's discretion, but it all worked out.

**Grand Case:** This was my kids' (13 and 18) favorite beach. We rented chairs at Tropic's Beach Cafe. Good food and drink. Not the best service we had all week, but good enough. The beach was beautiful and there were enough people for it to seem active and fun without it being mobbed.

**Friar's Bay:** This was my (and my wife's) favorite beach of the trip. We rented chairs from Friar's Bay Beach Cafe and spent the day relaxing, drinking rum punch and rosé and eating some of the best food we had all week. Highly recommend this off-the-beaten-path spot (literally -- the road there was pretty beaten up).

**Restaurants, bakeries, shopping.**

We mostly ate breakfast at the house and had lunch at whatever beach bar we rented chairs from but for some dinners we ate out.

**Calmos Cafe (Grand Case):** Incredible food, service, and location right on the beach. We loved it so much the first night that we went back a couple of nights later.

**SAO (Orient):** A nice break from island and French food. Really great service and food across the board.

**Ocean 82 (Grand Case):** We always try to do a nice, sunset-view dinner for our last night, so we went to Oceans 82 last Friday. Incredible spot and food (and wine). Not the cheapest spot, but we though it was well worth it.

**Lulu's Cafe (Cul de Sac):** Breakfast and lunch spot that we visited for breakfast one morning. The service was just okay (they seemed more interested in serving the French-speaking patrons haha) but it's a great spot with great food. If we had realized how good it was, we would have gone back multiple times.

**French Bakery (Cul de Sac):** Clearly meant for and frequented by locals, but we enjoyed the coffee and pastries and baguette all week. I think we went 4 times.

**Sebastien Quillere Patisserie (Cul de Sac):** My daughter (13) loved this place. Incredible sweet pastries and croissants. Get there early for a greater selection.

**Grape Wine Shop (Cul de Sac):** Incredible selection of (mostly) French wine, including some of the best Champagne prices I've ever seen anywhere. Also a great selection of cheese, dried sausages, and other cheese board stables. Incredibly friendly, helpful folks working there too.

I think that covers the highlights and things that I think might help people with their own planning.

I’ve just landed in Portugal and spent my first week in a hostel — it was such a great way to meet people and I had some amazing, if fleeting, connections. Now that I’m settling in a bit more, I’d love to build something more lasting here.

I’m hoping to meet others who are up for coffee hangouts, weekend adventures, exploring little towns, beach days, or just swapping stories over a glass of vinho verde. I’m open to connecting with fellow expats or locals — anyone who enjoys good company and discovering what Portugal has to offer.

If you’re in the area and this sounds like your kind of vibe, feel free to say hi! ✨",0,1754937515.0,PortugalExpats,2,0.5,False

 So. Okay. . . this is . . . Okay. I . . . this is kind of creepy, Detective Pendleton. I‘m sorry. Bob. You said I should call you Bob, like we‘re old friends or something. I guess that considering the first time we met was after the fire and then again just yesterday when you came to the hospital to see my mom . . . well, that might be true. That we‘re friends, I mean. Only, you know, that first time? When I was eight? I was unconscious and on a ventilator and had already died twice. So I really don‘t think meeting that way counts.  
 Anyway. . .  
b  
You want me to tell the truth.  
The truth is . . . I am so cold. I should be dead. Maybe I am.  
That would be okay.  
 c  
You know what I was just thinking, Bob? Tell is such an interesting word. There are so many meanings. There‘s telling, like spinning a tale, making up stories. I‘m good at that.  
 Of course, in that kind of telling, there is another tell, as in telling the difference between night and day, girl and boy, fact and dream. If you ask me, this is related to a gambler‘s tell. You know, how something a player does or says tells the other players that he‘s bluffing? David Mamet did this great movie, House of Games, all about that. Yeah, I know Mamet. Don‘t be so surprised. When you spend four months on a psych ward and then the rest of the year at home in exile, you watch a lot of movies.  
  
  Anyway, you know what I liked best about that film? The bad girl; the shrink who shoots her lover, that con man who sets her up. Because, in the end, she gets away with it and forgives herself.  
Wish I could do that.  
 d  
So, Bob, I can tell. I can tell plenty. But the truth? I don‘t know what that is. I thought I knew until this afternoon, but now. . . . Even if I tell my version of the truth, then what? I‘ll go back to being the old me? Well, what kind of future is that? Because let me tell you about the old me, Bob, the beta-version of Jenna Lord.  
Here‘s how Beta-Jenna thinks: They let me go, and I’ll cut. Walk out of this room and into the waiting arms of Psycho-Dad—and I’ll cut. Together, we’ll visit my crispy critter of a mother, who’s a drunk and wants only the best for me—and I’ll cut.  
I’ll cut.         I’ll cut.  
Yeah. Going back to being Beta-Jenna makes the truth just so attractive.  
 e  
The truth.  Well, the year I was fifteen completely sucked. Considering I‘ve died twice, that‘s really saying something. I was a month shy of sweet sixteen when I started my sophomore year at Turing, this science-techie school just outside Milwaukee for brainiacs, which I‘m supposed to be. Skipped a grade, tested out of classes, yada, yada. It goes without saying that I‘m a straight-A-plus student, a quiet kid, sort of a loser, and the kind of girl no one would ever suspect.  
  
  Or notice.  
  
  Okay, other stuff, other stuff . . .  
  
  Well, my cell phone is pink. I‘m a very careful driver. I‘ve never kissed a boy, which feels . . . wrong. Because I am sweet sixteen, the age when a girl is supposed to find her prince and settle down.  
  
  I used to pretend I was Ariel. I had the doll and a blue gown for dress-up, like in the movie. I was wearing the dress the night we first met, Bob, although you probably don‘t remember that because by then, I‘d died a couple of times; the dress was only so much ash; and there was kind of a lot going on.  
  
  I don‘t remember much about the fire, the one that swallowed Grandpa‘s house eight years ago. I do recall cowering behind the boiler and listening to Grandpa crashing around the kitchen. Then, there was the angry sputter of an argument and, later, the thud as Grandpa MacAllister passed out, a lit cigarette still pinched between his fingers and two more smoldering on the sill over the kitchen sink. That‘s where they said the fire started, you remember, Bob? How those lacy curtains, soaked in vodka because Grandpa knocked over the bottle when he blacked out, must‘ve caught with a whump?  
  
  The next is a jumble: the churn of black smoke; the spiking scream of the alarm; the hiss and crackle of orange flames. But I do remember the fear icing my whole body, freezing me in place.  
  
  And then I remember Matt, my older brother, frantically shouting my name. His voice was a lifeline, a hook that set in my heart, and I grabbed on tight, swarming up the cellar stairs in a swirl of pale blue petticoat as Matt forced the door. But the fire was greedy. Its orange fingers snagged my dress which died in a sizzling shriek.  
  
  And then I was screaming because the fire was eating my back and Matt was dodging flames, running with me in his arms, but the front door was still so far away and then . . .  
  
  f  
  
  I heard my mother, screeching, wild, fighting with the EMTs: Don’t you dare . . .  
  
  g  
  
  When they shocked me to life, I blazed back into this huge supernova. Fire hot enough to fry skin and melt fat ignites pain, too: constant and agonizing and so bad you can‘t die fast enough. I wanted to scream at the doctors to stop, stop, but I was mute. The fire had scorched my lungs and boiled my voice. A tube snaked down my throat, pushing in and then sucking out the air from my lungs. So, there was no way to tell anyone what I wanted. Wouldn‘t have done any good anyway because no one will let a kid die. They think they‘re doing you this big favor keeping you going because you‘ve got your whole life ahead.  
  
  Well, news flash, Bob: Not. Necessarily.  
  
  Because you think there‘s only one kind of pain? That pain is pain is pain?  
  
  Uh, that would be no.  
  
  There‘s blood-pain. There‘s knife-pain. There‘s bang-your-funny-bone-pain.  
  
  And then there is the pain of fire, molten and alive: the swirl of flames streaming over rotten wood and naked flesh. That pain moves when you move; it mutters between every breath; it spikes your ears; it rips. You think pain can‘t be any more horrible than that.  
  
  Until you discover that the well is bottomless. There‘s always more. A different kind of pain, maybe, but more and much, much worse.  
  
  But that would be getting ahead of myself.  
  
  h  
  
  Pain‘s not all I remember, of course. There were bright lights. The beep of monitors.  
  
  Needles and tubes. Lots of faces . . . God, now that I think of it, they brought me to this same ER. Maybe these are the same doctors, but I don‘t know because I faded in and out. I do recall that everyone, every face, was grim, like they‘d read this story before and knew the end wasn‘t pretty.  
  
  Later, the doctors said how lucky I was that my mom and Matt had decided to pick me up from Grandpa‘s early. Lucky to be alive. Lucky, lucky, lucky.  
  
  Yeah, that‘s me, Bob. I‘m just so, so lucky.  
  
  i  
  
  I‘m beating around the bush. I know I am. I don‘t want to tell this story, Bob, and you know why? Because this is a fairy tale with teeth and claws, and here‘s what completely sucks: you‘re going to want black and white, Bob, right and wrong. I‘m not sure I can give that to you. That‘s the problem with the truth. Sometimes the truth is ambiguous, or a really bad cliché.  
  
  But this is the truth, Bob: I‘m a liar.  
  
  I am lucky, a liar, a good girl, a princess, a thief—and a killer.  
  
  And my reality—my story—begins with Mr. Anderson.  
  
  2: a  
  
  Of course, the library doors were locked.  
  
  Score another point for Psycho-Dad, who got impatient when I reminded him to double-check and make sure the school librarian would be there to let me in. ?Stop worrying about it,? he‘d said the night before. ?I talked to the school last week. They said there was no problem. ?  
  
  Well, wrong-o there, Dad.  
  
  b  
  
  
  Turing High was one of those Psycho-Dad command decisions, same as us moving to a new McMansion ninety miles north of Milwaukee after my stint on the psych ward. Or was that my breakdown? No, no, it was my ?little episode,? Psycho-Dadspeak for my stay in the place where the nuts feed the squirrels. My father always called it a ? little episode,?  
  
  as if my life was a sitcom and we could simply channel-surf right on past.  
  
  We were in Rebecca‘s office when he first floated the idea in March, and although I hadn‘t known it then, I‘d only see my therapist twice more: another linchpin in Psycho-Dad‘s clean-slate campaign.  
  
  ?Turing makes sense,? he‘d said. ?Jenna‘s a bright, sensitive girl. She‘s just had a . .  
  
  . little episode, that‘s all. When she was on the, ah . . . ?  
  
  ?Ward?? I prompted. I was sprawled in my usual spot, a plump, brown leather armchair. ?Unit??  
  
  Dad‘s lips set in this line above his chin, a fissure in granite. I never talked to my father like that at home, not unless I wanted Psycho-Dad to pay a visit. Of course, the go-to for that is he‘s a shock trauma plastic surgeon and and screws his nurse and has temper tantrums because he‘s just under so much stress. Not that we talk about the blow-outs or the affairs. All that‘s no one‘s business. It‘s a family matter. You know what I‘m talking about, Bob.  
  
  But Rebecca‘s office was my turf. Dad had to behave himself. Doctors are very sensitive about their reputations in front of other doctors, even if the other doc is a shrink and the lowest form of life because all docs know that the med students who become psychiatrists were always pretty squirrely to begin with, the ones who went all girly around blood and guts. Rebecca being a girll. . . well, that was proof.  
  
  ?Yes,? he said. ?Your teacher there said you were light-years ahead of the other kids. ?  
  
  This was true, though that wasn‘t saying much. In the four months I‘d been an inpatient, there were only two kids who stayed long enough to need more than their regular homework delivered. One was eleven and manic half the time—when he wasn‘t in the quiet room, threatening to blow up the joint, that is. The other girl was seventeen, had gotten pregnant, and then started throwing up to stay thin. The baby finally starved, and she miscarried. Only she couldn‘t—wouldn‘t—stop puking. I think there was only one week where she wasn‘t walking around with a feeding tube taped to her nose, and a psych tech within arm‘s reach.  
  
  ?I‘ve had a long talk with the principal and guidance counselor at Turing,? Dad was saying. ?They‘ve assured me that they are accustomed to dealing with kids who‘ve had . . .problems. ?  
  
  ?You told them about me?? I shot a glance at Rebecca, who was scowling. ?Did you know about this??  
  
  ?Not exactly,? Rebecca said. ?Dr. Lord, don‘t you—?  
  
  ?I didn‘t think it was necessary to involve Becky in the preliminary stages. ? Dad never called Rebecca Dr. Savage and even Rebecca didn‘t call herself Becky. ?This isn‘t Becky‘s decision to make anyway. ?  
  
  ?But you didn‘t ask me,? I said, stupidly believing that maybe, oh, all those hours of family therapy had made a dent. ?We didn‘t discuss it. ?  
  
  Mom, the apologist, jumped in. ?Your father didn‘t mean any harm. ?  
  
  ?Why can‘t I just go on being homeschooled??  
  
  ?That‘s a nonstarter,? said Dad.  
  
  ?Why??  
  
  ?Because. Emily has her hands full with the bookstore. I‘ve got surgeries scheduled every day, and that‘s not counting emergency reconstructions. I‘m at the hospital six, sometimes seven, days a week. Neither your mother nor I have the time to babysit you. ?  
  
  That drew a little blood, as Dad had intended. I looked away, chewing on my lower lip, willing the tears not to fall. I turned to Rebecca. ?Please. Say something. ?  
  
  Rebecca sighed. ?Unfortunately, your parents have a point, Jenna. You do need to be around kids your own age, and preferably ones without serious problems. You won‘t get that if you hide in your house. Being alone is when you‘ve run into problems. ?  
  
  ?Yeah, but I was in school when it hap—? I let that die. I couldn‘t argue. Even though I hadn‘t cut for over six weeks—a new record for me back then—the urge was there, all the time. It was like what that bulimic girl from the ward said: If I go an hour and don’t think about throwing up, I worry there’s something wrong. Puking’s the new normal.  
  
  Slicing and dicing myself would land me back in the hospital, though, and I knew it.  
  
  All the doors in the new McMansion had locks, but I wasn‘t allowed to use them.  
  
  Sometimes after I showered, my mom would barge in as I was toweling off with her patented: ?Oh! I didn‘t know anyone was in here. ? Uh-huh. I saw how her eyes flicked fast, up and down, searching for new cuts, fresh scabs. I knew she checked the trash for bloodied tissues or used Band-Aids. Heaven forbid they ever looked behind the false panel beneath my vanity and found my nail scissors. I hadn‘t used them since I‘d been home, but they were . . . insurance.  
  
  I thought of something else. ?Wait a minute,? I said to Rebecca. ?Don‘t you need my permission before you release records or something??  
  
  Rebecca shook her head. ?Not technically. You‘re only fifteen. ?  
  
  ?I‘ll be sixteen in September. ?  
  
  ?It doesn‘t matter. Until you‘re eighteen, your parents have full say over release of your records. Legally, I can‘t stop them. ?  
  
  Dad snapped his fingers to get our attention. ?Let‘s stay on track, shall we? The point is, Jenna, you are perfectly capable of being around kids your own age, and Turing‘s an excellent private science and tech school. ?  
  
  ?Who said I‘m going into science?? I demanded, although that was probably the stupidest thing I could‘ve said. The best Christmas gift I‘d ever gotten was this Edu Junior Scientist Kit Matt bought with his own money when I was five. Mom had a fit when I filled the basement with orange smoke. ?Doesn‘t my opinion count??  
  
  ?She has a point,? Rebecca said. About time, too. ?I‘ll be honest, Dr. Lord. I was under the impression we were discussing Turing. I had no idea Jenna‘s records had been released, much less that she‘d been accepted. I haven‘t even gotten a request for a summary letter from Turing‘s guidance counselor. ?  
  
  ?Wait. ? Mom looked at Dad. ?They don‘t have a letter from Rebecca??  
  
  ?No,? Dad said, and then he sighed as if he was just so sick of having to get us all up to speed. He spoke slowly and distinctly, like we were morons. ?It‘s bad enough that Jenna‘s wasted months of her life, recovering from her . . . ? He waved a hand to swat my past away. ?I see no reason why we should burden her further by prejudicing them with Becky‘s observations. Jenna‘s out of the hospital. She‘s on no medications. She‘s at home, not in a straitjacket. She comes here, what, twice a month? Becky, no disrespect, but there are one hundred and sixty-eight hours in a week, out of which my daughter spends, exactly, one hour with you. No, less than that: fifty minutes. Your involvement is minimal. I doubt you have much of an impact at this point. ?  
  
  ?I see. ? Rebecca‘s tone dripped acid. ?So what, exactly, is your point, Dr. Lord??  
  
  ?My point is that we are grateful to you. We acknowledge the help you‘ve given Jenna. But her future will not depend upon the fifty minutes she spends here, nor an assessment based on limited exposure. ?  
  
  ?In other words,? I said to Rebecca, ?you‘re fired. ?  
  
  Psycho-Dad blustered a little bit, said things like outgrown and hatched and time to spread her wings, like I was some kind of baby bird Rebecca just wouldn‘t let out of the nest, she was so protective. But it all boiled down to this: Dad decided I needed a fresh start. Turing was in, and little Becky was out. My opinion didn‘t count. God hath spoken.  
  
  Something that happens a lot when your dad‘s last name is Lord.  
  
  c  
  
  That summer, I stayed put in my parents‘ new McMansion, which never felt like home. While I was an inpatient, Dad had gotten rid of all my old furniture. I now had a four-poster with a frilly canopy that I completely hated, which was kind of ironic considering how hard I‘d begged when I was younger because all princesses had canopy beds.  
  
  I weeded the garden, mowed the grass, clipped around the trees, painted the picnic table that no one sat on. Given my mom owned a bookstore, there was always plenty to read, so I devoured at least three books a week. When I wasn‘t reading or doing chores, I single-handedly kept Netflix in business.  
  
  And I e-mailed Matt, although I didn‘t tell anyone. I‘d never even mentioned it to Rebecca, who would‘ve freaked. All our e-mails were on a separate e-mail account that I set up on this ghost server run out of Israel, if you can believe it. I know it sounds like overkill, Bob, but I had to be über-careful. My parents hated that Matt enlisted. I think what really ate at Psycho-Dad was that once Matt was eighteen, he was free and our father couldn‘t do a damn thing about that.  
  
  And what Matt wanted was to run; to get the hell out. It didn‘t work out the way he planned—or, maybe, you know . . . it did. Once he was in Iraq and gone, my parents wouldn‘t talk about it, or him. So, if they found out we were keeping in touch, my mom would‘ve had a nervous breakdown. Dad‘s head would explode. Really, I didn‘t need the headaches.  
  
  I didn‘t blame Matt for running. Before my life came crashing down around my ears, I was on the cross-country team. That summer before Turing, I thought about starting up again, doing some serious training. Except I never did—not then, anyway—because I think I knew, somehow, that I could run and run and run away into forever and still never get anywhere.  
  
  The truth is, Bob, that no matter how far or fast you go, the past always follows: an inky, faceless thing tacked to your shoes that only the harshest light can kill, and then just for those few moments when there is nothing but the strongest fire from the brightest sun, breaking over your shoulders, burning that shadow—and your past—to ash.  
  
  d  
  
  So now, at quarter past six in the morning, I stood in the semi-dark of a strange high school, staring at locked doors and wondering what to do. Mom was long gone, her taillights flashing as she took the circular drive and headed back down the access road which bled into the highway and east toward her mother‘s—my grandmother‘s—old bookstore. Mom wouldn‘t be back for another twelve hours when we would wash, rinse, repeat every single school day for some unspecified time in my bright, sunny future. That is, until she—or more likely, Dad—decided I was normal enough to get my license. Given everything that had happened, I thought that would be a long time coming.  
  
  Where was everyone? My watch sa  
id I still had almost ninety minutes before that first bell. The office staff probably wouldn‘t show for at least a half hour. I could sit tight except my backpack weighed a ton and I had a cup of sickly sweet cappuccino I didn‘t want, but Mom had insisted on buying—like coffee was some kind of rite of passage, a ticket into my new life. Maybe I could put away some of my notebooks at least? I remembered from orientation that my locker was upstairs and to the left. The stairs I needed were all the way down this next hall, I thought, past the cafeteria and—  
  
  ?Hey!?  
  
  I whirled, a scream-bubble at the back of my throat. The guy was squat and burly, with a bottle-brush mustache and a grimy red rag threaded through an empty belt loop.  
  
  ?I . . . uh . . . ? I swallowed my heart back into my chest. ?I came early. . . I have. . . I have permission. . . uh. . . ?  
  
  ?Doors don‘t officially open for almost another hour. ?  
  
  ?They were open. My dad was supposed to arrange it. Me waiting in the library, I mean, so I thought I could come in. ? This was crazy. Did this creepy guy want me to go back outside and wait on the curb while he locked the front doors?  
  
  ?Librarian isn‘t here. ? His eyes kept drifting from my face to my chest.  
  
  Maybe he was a little slow. ?I know. ?  
  
  ?Didn‘t anyone tell me. ?  
  
  ?I‘m sorry. The doors were open. ?  
  
  ?You said that,? he said, speaking to my breasts. ?That‘s not supposed to happen either. ?  
  
  ?Well, there are two cars in the lot. ?  
  
  ?The pickup‘s mine. ?  
  
  Which left a Prius with an empty bike rack on its roof. ?So maybe one of the teachers came in early and left the door open??  
  
  ?Maybe. ? His face folded in a scowl. ?You got ID??  
  
  All I had was my learner‘s permit, which I fumbled from my wallet. He stepped close, squinting at the picture, his eyes clicking from it to me and back again. He stank of cigarettes and sweat and ammonia. Finally he said, ?Okay. Library‘s down the end of the hall.

It says urgent. Storage at bank; payments due now. Huh? Why does Brian have a bank charge? Stewie shrugs. ""Maybe he wants to keep overpriced books in a vault."" Later, In the living room. It is clean-up day, and Brian is going back and forth. Peter is in the closet. And Stewie Peter is digging through the closet. He finds an old gun. ""Guys, look at this random old gun I found!"" Brian glances over and whispers to himself, ""Needs cleaning."" Stewie hears it. And suddenly, it connects. He remembers the time Brian was vulnerable, the time he admitted the gun in the safe was meant for himself, for when life got too hard. Stewie realizes Brian is planning to leave. And that thought scares him more than he's ready for.  

 

The moon has a full view of the sky. The family is asleep. Only Brian and Stewie were awake. Brian is in the living room again, still reading the same book. Stewie finally gets courage. ""Do you still have the gun, Brian?"" The air disappears from the room. Brian, cool as ever: ""Yes. I still have it."" Questions swirl in Stewie's head. One cuts through: ""Do you know what you said at the bank? Because we were trapped in that bank you said  that gun was had a way out when life became to heavy. Has your mindset changed, Brian? “Brian doesn't answer. Stewie looks at him. Realization was darned on him. Oh god. ""Okay, we have three options. Hospital, 911, or a gun lock."" Brian thinks for a beat. ""I don't want to go to the hospital. Or have you called 911 So… a gun lock."" Brian replied ""Of course,"" Stewie replies flatly. Then raises an eyebrow. ""But where would we find a gun lock?"" Brian blinks. ""Are you serious? It's been unlocked for three months. Stewie's already on his phone. ""Free guns are locked near me. Oh, look, Brian. The police have gun lock. Let's go”. They drive to the Police Station. At the front desk, the officer hands over the lock. Stewie takes it.He give  

 

 

 Brian a sharp look. Voice quiet: ""Let's not have an accident."" He stares into Brian's soul. Five full seconds. They drive to the bank. The thick silence clings to his throat and settles in his chest. They're back here again. The gun lock feels like a brick in his hand. Heavy. Cold. Too necessary. The vault opens. Inside: a gun. And a book. Brian steps forward. ""One moment."" He lifts the gun like he's done a thousand times. Hands steady. The movements are too smooth. Flick. Click. Pop. The chamber opens. 

 

 A single bullet drops into his paw. He stares at it.  A moment of looking at it. Stewie's face changes into pure fear. Then, with zero hesitation, then Brian snaps the chamber shut close. There's nothing behind his eyes when he does it. It's just a dog who's done pretending. No emotion. No change in expression. Just a routine. He doesn't speak right away. His expression says everything. Brian, calm as ever: ""I wanted to check if there was a bullet in there."" Stewie's voice is tight, eyes sharp: ""You damn knew there was a bullet in there."" Without another word, Stewie locks the gun. Hands trembling, grip firm. He locks it like it's the only thing keeping his heart from falling apart. Stewie's face made me give a sharp glance to Brian. ""What the fuck, Brian? Why do you look at that bullet like that?” 10 seconds of silence. Brian goes silent and blank, not looking at Stewie. ""Oh, oh god, we need to go to the hospital now."" The room is silent except for the click of the gun lock. Stewie is standing in one place. Breathing hard and fast. Then look at Brian with shock and fear.  

   

Stewie speed drives to the hospital. Weaves through traffic. He picks up the phone. Calls Meg. In a panic voice “met me in the hospital. It is Brian. Don’t tell Peter or Lois, one won’t care, and the other one will make it worse.  ""Meg tease. You called me instead of handling it on our own. Must be big"" There is silence. “How big is it? “Meg asked."" Meg, it is very big, so meet me at the hospital.  

   

They wait in the waiting room. Times slows down.  Meg is there, Stewie and Brian. Before they check in, Brian. Stewie says thank God it is over. Brian face fell into a frown. Stewie's face says say what the fuck you wanted to say. Brian gets taken.   

   

Meg and Stewie comes home. Stewie sits down on the couch. And looks around the room. What the fuck did his face mean, he thought. Then his eyes caught the brown box. sitting under the coffee table He slowly reaches the box. And in the box was a collar, book, and note that crumbled up. He opened the note and said “take care of the stuff. This stuff is worth more than anything in my life.” Stewie's mouth drops, and the note drops. Meg backs away.    

   

Two weeks later, Brian was released from the hospital. The air is tense. Stewie turns on the radio. The song ended with another happy, upbeat song. The next song was called ""Let Down"" by Radio Head. Stewie tries to change the song but doesn't. ""You know, you know where you are with   

You know where you are with   

Floor collapsing   

Floating, bouncing back. They get to the end of the song, and he turns off the song. Stewie whispers, ""I know where I am. Briain pauses. With my best friend, who has a way out, like  it is another task. Dinner is silent, and Lois and Peter joke about their days. But the silence between Meg, Brian, and Stewie is undeniable. It's night. Brian goes to Stewie's room. And look around. He sees a book that has a bump. He picks it up. Click. The key dropped. He looks at Stewie and whisper not today, and hurried, put away the key. The next day, Brian and Stewie eat breakfast. Brian says, ""Did you know that books are the key to an open mind? Brian stares at Stewie. But it was blank with a sad eye pleading for help.    

At 3 pm., He picks up the phone and calls Joe the police officer. Ring. “What's up, Stewie? ""Joe answered. ""I will be at the library in an hour. Please.” Something shifted in Joe's voice. ""Okay, I'll be there."" The library was quiet. Two of them were at one table. ""So,' Joe said, clearing his throat,"" What's up?"". Stewie didn't look; He slid as the key across the table, Joe. Joe picked it up. ""What is this, Stewie?"" Joe Gun lock Brian's Stewie voice was flat. “It's Brian's way out. Just take it.” Joe froze. Stewie eye flicked up for the first time. He opened his mouth to explain the box, the bullet, and how Brian's hand didn't shake. But the word caught. He shut his mouth. And that was enough. ",1,1754937392.0,u_Civil-Advance-2841,0,1.0,False

The night is a cruel custodian of longing, stretching time into a heavy, slow-moving river where absence thickens the air like the scent of old books in an abandoned library. Shadows creep along the walls, whispering the names of those who once filled the spaces now left hollow. You listen, half-dreaming, half-remembering, uncertain whether the voices belong to memory, or some phantom echo trapped in the folds of time.
And so, it begins.
The day unfurls with a deceptive lightness, the sun rising with a practiced indifference, spilling gold onto streets that no longer belong to you. People move through their routines with the precision of clockwork figures, each gesture rehearsed, each smile a flicker on the surface of something vast and unknowable. You mimic them—drinking coffee, exchanging pleasantries, nodding in all the right places—yet beneath your skin, the ache lingers, coiled and patient. It is the quiet hum beneath the world’s noise, the invisible thread stitching together past and present. Is this existence, or merely an approximation of it? You begin to suspect that life is not a sequence of events but rather a series of images, looping endlessly, distorting themselves, blurring the distinction between what was and what is imagined.
The hours pass, but time itself feels slippery, unreliable, like sand slipping through fingers you can no longer feel. You catch yourself glancing at your phone, seeking proof of your own existence in the form of a message, a missed call, a sign that somewhere, someone is thinking of you. But the screen stares back with an indifference not unlike the sun’s, and you realize—perhaps with some degree of horror—that the world has continued without you, as if your presence was never integral to its mechanics. The weight of irrelevance settles over you, a quiet despair wrapped in the mundane. You curse yourself for expecting anything different, for craving something as trivial as acknowledgement. How pathetic it is, this hunger for validation, for proof that you are more than an afterthought.
And then the night arrives.
This is when the silence turns cavernous, swallowing sound, swallowing self. The city hums in the distance, but in your room, the air is thick with ghosts. The past becomes tangible—more real than the present—woven into the fabric of the dark like invisible threads that bind you to what was. You try to sleep, but sleep has long abandoned you. Instead, you wander through your mind’s labyrinthine corridors, opening doors that should have remained shut. Faces emerge from the fog of forgetting, voices sharpen, and the scent of a memory fills the space around you. It is not just missing—it is inhabiting the ache, surrendering to it, becoming one with its rhythm. You hate yourself for it, for this weakness, for this insatiable need to linger in what no longer exists.
You reach for the past, but it slips away, elusive as mist. You remember the shape of a hand, the curve of a smile, the way laughter used to fill the space between words—but the details blur, the edges dissolve. You panic, as if losing the sharpness of memory means losing yourself, as if each forgotten fragment is another piece of your being hollowed out, making room for nothingness. But then you begin to wonder: was it ever real at all? Could memory be nothing more than an intricate fiction, a narrative crafted to make sense of absence? If the past is an invention, then what of the self? Are you anything more than a compilation of recollections, a patchwork of ephemeral impressions destined to fade? And if so, what remains when those impressions finally disappear?
And then, the self-talk begins. The voice is not quite yours, not anymore. It speaks in a tone devoid of cruelty yet brimming with certainty, reminding you that you are unravelling. It tells you that time will swallow you whole, that soon you will be nothing more than a whisper in someone else's fading recollections. It is not a voice of malice—it is simply the voice of inevitability. And perhaps that is the cruellest revelation of all: not that you are disappearing, but that disappearance is the natural order of things. The world is an endless succession of forgettings, and you are merely one more instance of it. You laugh bitterly—perhaps you deserve to be forgotten. Perhaps you were never meant to be remembered at all.
The night does not end. It stretches, seamless, eternal. The sun may rise, but it is only an illusion of renewal. Each morning, you wake a little less whole, a little more translucent, as if the act of longing is eroding you. You have become a ghost haunting your own life, a figure at the edges of existence, weightless, formless, slowly dissolving into the folds of time. The world continues, and you remain—unseen, unheard, suspended in a dream that refuses to break. And in the back of your mind, a whisper emerges—a thought too cruel to voice: you did this to yourself. You wove your own prison from these threads of longing, and now you will never escape.
And so, the cycle continues.
You ache. You remember. You forget.

Whenever my in-laws visit, like other Asian parents, they start cleaning the house. I am not a messy person and I do keep my house clean, but They want to 'systematic' arrange things arround the house in the limited storage space available in my small house. What they don't realize is in the limited storage space available around the house, I have my own system of arranging things which makes it easier for me to find and get things. Whenever they 'systematically' arrange things, my house turns into escape room or treasure hunt for me and I have to constantly find my things; sometimes I never find them. Like they rearranged my kitchen in January and I still haven't found my one and only coffee mug. God knows if they broke it in their cleaning ritual and haven't told me yet. 
They put things away on higher shelf for me to ""just bring it down whenever you need them"", they think they are decluttering my space but I am 'out of sight, out of mind' kind of person, and I have forgotten about things or stopped using them because they are out of my easy access.
I  don't mind their cleaning really, but at least tell me where are you keeping my things so that I can find them whenever I want",3,1754937223.0,inlaws,3,1.0,False
1mnl57q,https://www.reddit.com/r/celebritycruises/comments/1mnl57q/virgin_vs_celebrity_edge_showdown/,Virgin vs Celebrity Edge Showdown,"After having been on 4 Virgin Voyages in the past 4 years, I was really hoping to like another cruise line and booked a Celebrity Edge Alaska 7 night cruise that we just returned from.  Unfortunately I'm heading back to Virgin Voyages.

First the positives on things I liked on Celebrity Edge better than Virgin:

* The overall ship was nicer - better furnishings, more luxurious, etc
* The theater - Virgin needs a theater that comfortable sits everyone - their small venues are too small, people line up for shows, run in to get a seat, and are standing room only usually.  Celebrity had a nice big theater with plenty of seating, no lines to get in, great drink service in your seat, etc.
* I liked Celebrity Edge's infinity balcony - enclosed but can be opened at the push of a button - it was great in Alaska with cooler temperatures - probably not so great for tropical cruises.
* I liked Celebrity's entertainment a little better than Virgin's  the magician was cool, the singer, even though Celebrity's comedian wasn't amazing, he was better than the 3 british ones on virgin that we walked out of (they were that bad).
* The bar menu drinks were better on Celebrity - especially at the martini bar.  TIP - you really need/want the premium package (drinks up to $19) vs the classic package (drinks up to $12) - which had very limited choices.
* The coffee place was better on Celebrity - it was nice just to have a large seating area in the morning and coffee service at your seat instead of waiting in line on Virgin and getting paper cups.

And for the negatives/issues on Celebrity:

* I like Virgin's wristband with key fob incorporated over Celebrity's card
* Celebrity Spa service is kind of a scam - my 100 minute massage was listed as a 2 hour event - so I assumed 10 minutes to get in, consult, undressed, etc, then 100 minute massage, then 10 minutes to leave/let them get the room ready for next guest.  Well it was actually like an 80 minutes of actual massage time.  My wife and daughters had the same issue with their facials.  My wife complained and they tried to tell her consult time is included.
* The onboard behind the scenes tour was pretty bad and not worth the $100.  It was very hard to understand the different crew members due to english not being their first language.  We were brought into rooms and told about stuff (i.e. brought to recycling room and spoke to for 10 minutes - it would have been nice if they showed us how some of the machines like the glass bottle recycler worked).  Saw the kitchen, recycling room, laundry, the bridge and engine control room in the 2 hours.  People we left the tour during it it was so bad.  Didn't get to see any of the crew areas (where they eat, live, etc)  You'd be better off watching one of the behind the scenes documentaries on TV instead of this tour.
* I much prefer Virgin's galley/buffet where you order at the table and it's brought out to you and guests don't handle the food.  Celebrity buffet was a mad house of people.  Sometimes it took 10-15 minutes just to find a seat.  And most of the buffet food items were not good and the amount of people I saw grab food with their hands or dropping of tongs and putting it back in the food was disgusting.
* Disappointed Celebrity gave me such a hard time when I requested my 22 year old daughters included 'classic' drink package be upgraded as a courtesy to the premium package since they automatically downgraded my 19 year old daughters classic drink package to the non-alcohol package.  Guest services argued with me, then said they had to get the bar manager, he gave me a hard time and blamed onshore services not being open in order to ask.  Ultimately he called and said they would do it for me, but not sure if they ever credited my account for the added cost (never got an invoice for the 2nd room).
* I like how Virgin is quiet with no announcements over the loudspeakers.  It felt like the Captain on Celebrity was trying to be the cruise director or a 'celebrity' - making announcements with inspirational quotes, speaking at shows, on gameshows, etc -I could have gone without.  The one place it would have been nice to see him was if he was actually in the bridge during the behind the scenes tour instead of a junior captain who's first time in Alaska.
* While the kids on board weren't terrible, I still preferred Virgin's no kids policy.

Putting all of the negatives aside which I can frankly live with, the food on Celebrity was not good - Virgin's food is way better.  And yes, of the 7 nights, we ate twice in the main dining room, once at the buffet (since back on ship time was at 11pm), and 4 specialty restaurants.  

The only 'good' meal was at the Raw on 5 sushi restaurant - it was really really good even though we aren't huge sushi lovers.  The filet medallions they had were the best steak on the ship.

The steakhouse wasn't very good - the 'ribeyes' weren't really rib eye steaks, not sure what they were.  The quality wasn't good and sides were bad.

Eden was decent, but the tasting menu was even another charge on top of the specialty dining package I purchased - so I just went with the a la carte menu to also not hold up my family.

And the Le Petit Chef restaurant that had a 4 course fix menu with animations throughout wasn't very good either - there were only 4 other tables occupied in the restaurant the first night when we went.

Oh well, at least we gave it a shot. . . . .  back to Virgin for me",6,1754937196.0,celebritycruises,4,0.63,False

We could grab coffee at a quiet bar, wander through a museum, stay up too late talking about the strange corners of life… or just chill in home with blankets, Netflix, and a little bit of stolen warmth.  

If the chemistry is there, maybe it turns into something more, slow, natural, unforced. I’m not shy about wanting intimacy, but I think the journey to it is just as fun as the destination.

  N o one knew for certain when the trouble started at the Colgan School. Some members of its alumni association blamed the decision to admit girls. Others cited newfangled liberal ideals and a general decline in the respect for elders worldwide. But no matter the theory, no one could deny that, recently, life at the Colgan School was different.  
  
  Oh, its grounds were still perfectly manicured. Three quarters of the senior class were already well on their way to being early-accepted into the Ivy League. Photos of presidents and senators and CEOs still lined the dark-paneled hallway outside the headmaster's office.  
  
  But in the old days, no one would ever have declined admission to Colgan on the day before classes started, forcing the administration to scramble to fill the slot. Historically, any  
  
  2  
  
  vacancy would have been met with a waiting list a mile long, but this year, for some reason, there was only one applicant eager to enroll at that late date.  
  
  Most of all, there had been a time when honor meant something at the Colgan School, when school property was respected, when the faculty was revered--when the headmaster's mint-condition 1958 Porsche Speedster would never have been placed on top of the fountain in the quad with water shooting out of its headlights on an unusually warm evening in November.  
  
  There had been a time when the girl responsible--the very one who had lucked into that last-minute vacancy only a few months before--would have had the decency to admit what she'd done and quietly taken her leave of the school. But unfortunately, that era, much like the headmaster's car, was finished.  
  
  Two days after Porsche-gate, as the students had taken to calling it, the girl in question had the nerve to sit in the hallway of the administration building beneath the black-and-white stare of three senators, two presidents, and a Supreme Court justice, with her head held high, as if she'd done nothing wrong.  
  
  More students than usual filed down the corridor that day, going out of their way to steal a glance and whisper behind cupped hands.  
  
  ""That's her.""  
  
  ""She's the one I was telling you about."" ""How do you think she did it?""  
  
  Any other student might have flinched in that bright spotlight, but from the moment Katarina Bishop set foot on the Colgan campus, she'd been something of an enigma. Some said  
  
  3  
  
  she'd gained her last-minute slot because she was the daughter of an incredibly wealthy European businessman who had made a very generous donation. Some looked at her perfect posture and cool demeanor, rolled her first name across their tongues, and assumed that she was Russian royalty--one of the last of the Romanovs.  
  
  Some called her a hero; others called her a freak.  
  
  Everyone had heard a different story, but no one knew the truth--that Kat really had grown up all over Europe, but she wasn't an heiress. That she did, in fact, have a Faberge egg, but she wasn't a Romanov. Kat herself could have added a thousand rumors to the mill, but she stayed quiet, knowing that the only thing no one would believe was the truth.  
  
  ""Katarina?"" the headmaster's secretary called. ""The board will see you now.""  
  
  Kat rose calmly, but as she stepped toward the open door twenty feet from the headmaster's office, she heard her shoes squeak; she felt her hands tingle. Every nerve in her body seemed to stand on end as she realized that somehow, in the last three months, she had become someone who wore squeaky shoes.  
  
  That, whether she liked it or not, they were going to hear her coming.  
  
  Kat was used to looking at a room and seeing all the angles, but she'd never seen a room quite like this before.  
  
  Though the hallway outside was long and straight, this room was round. Dark wood surrounded her; dim lights hung from a low ceiling. It felt to Kat almost like a cave, except for a tall, slim window where a narrow beam of sunlight came pouring in. Suddenly, Kat found herself reaching out, wanting  
  
  4  
  
  to run her hands through the rays. But then someone cleared his throat, a pencil rolled across a desk, and Kat's shoes squeaked again, bringing her back to the moment. ""You may sit down.""  
  
  The voice came from the back of the room, and at first Kat didn't know who'd spoken. Like the voice, the faces before her were unfamiliar: the twelve on her right were wrinkle-free and fresh--students just like her (or as much like her as a Colgan student could possibly be). The twelve people on her left had hair that was a little thinner, or makeup that was a little heavier. But regardless of age, all the members of the Colgan School Honor Board were wearing identical black robes and impassive expressions as they watched Kat walk to the center of the circular room.  
  
  ""Sit, Ms. Bishop,"" Headmaster Franklin said from his place in the front row. He looked especially pale in his dark robe. His cheeks were too puffy, his hair too styled. He was the sort of man, Kat realized, who probably wished he were as fast and sporty as his car. And then, despite everything, Kat grinned a little, imagining the headmaster himself propped up in the middle of the quad, squirting water.  
  
  As Kat took her seat, the senior boy beside the headmaster rose and announced, ""The Colgan School Honor Board shall come to order."" His voice echoed around the room. ""All who wish to speak shall be heard. All who wish to follow the light shall see. All who wish to seek justice shall find the truth. Honor for one,"" the boy finished, and before Kat could really process what she'd heard, twenty-four voices chorused, ""Honor for all.""  
  
  The boy sat and ruffled through the pages of an old leather-bound book until the headmaster prodded, ""Jason ...""  
  
  5  
  
  ""Oh. Yeah."" Jason picked up the heavy book. ""The Colgan School Honor Board will hear the case of Katarina Bishop, sophomore. The committee will hear testimony that on the tenth of November, Ms. Bishop did willfully ... um ... steal personal property."" Jason chose his words carefully, while a girl in the second row stifled a laugh.  
  
  ""That by committing this act at two a.m., she was also in violation of the school curfew. And that Ms. Bishop willfully destroyed school artifacts."" Jason lowered the book and paused--a little more dramatically than necessary, Kat thought--before he added, ""According to the Colgan Code of Honor, these charges are punishable by expulsion. Do you understand the charges as they have been read to you?""  
  
  Kat took a moment to make sure the board really did want her to respond before she said, ""I didn't do it.""  
  
  ""The charges."" Headmaster Franklin leaned forward. ""The question, Ms. Bishop, was whether you understood the charges.""  
  
  ""I do."" Kat felt her heartbeat change rhythm. ""I just don't agree with them.""  
  
  ""I--"" the headmaster started again, but a woman to his right touched his arm lightly.  
  
  She smiled at Kat as she said, ""Headmaster, I seem to remember that in matters such as this, it's customary to take the student's full academic history into account. Perhaps we should begin with a review of Ms. Bishop's record?""  
  
  ""Oh."" The headmaster seemed to deflate a bit. ""Well, that's quite right, Ms. Connors, but since Ms. Bishop has only been with us a few months, she has no record to speak of.""  
  
  ""But surely this is not the first school the young woman  
  
  6  
  
  has attended?"" Ms. Connors asked, and Kat bit back a nervous laugh.  
  
  ""Well, yes,"" the headmaster admitted grudgingly. ""Of course. And we tried to contact those schools, but there was a fire at Trinity that destroyed the entire admissions office and most of their records. And the Bern Institute experienced a terrible computer crash last summer, so we've had a very difficult time finding . . . things.""  
  
  The headmaster looked at Kat as if disasters must follow wherever she went. Ms. Connors, on the other hand, looked impressed. ""Those are two of the finest schools in Europe.""  
  
  ""Yes, ma'am. My fath  
er, he ... does a lot of work there."" ""What do your parents do?""  
  
  As Kat searched the second row for the girl who'd posed the question, she started to ask exactly why her parents' occupations mattered. But then she remembered that Colgan was the kind of place where who your parents were and what they did always seemed to matter.  
  
  ""My mother died when I was six.""  
  
  A few people gave a slight sigh at this, but Headmaster Franklin pressed on. ""And your father?"" he asked, unwilling to let a conveniently deceased mother swing any sympathy votes Kat's way. ""What does he do?""  
  
  ""Art,"" Kat said simply, carefully. ""He does a lot of things, but he specializes in art.""  
  
  At this, the head of the fine arts department perked up. ""Collecting?"" the man asked.  
  
  Again Kat had to fight back a smile. ""More like ... distribution.""  
  
  ""Interesting though this may be,"" Headmaster Franklin

  interrupted, ""it does not pertain to ... the matter at hand."" Kat could have sworn he'd stopped himself from saying to my convertible.  
  
  No one responded. The only motion in the room was the dust that still danced in the narrow beam of falling light. Finally, Headmaster Franklin leaned forward and narrowed his eyes. Kat had seen lasers with less focus as the headmaster snapped: ""Ms. Bishop, where were you on the night of November tenth?""  
  
  ""In my room. Studying.""  
  
  ""On a Friday night? You were studying?"" The headmaster glanced at his colleagues as if that were the most outrageous lie any Colgan student had ever dared to utter.  
  
  ""Well, Colgan is an exceptionally difficult institution. I have to study.""  
  
  ""And you didn't see anyone?"" Jason asked.  
  
  ""No, I--""  
  
  ""Oh, but someone saw you, didn't they, Ms. Bishop?"" Headmaster Franklin's voice was cold and sharp. ""We have cameras monitoring the grounds. Or didn't you know?"" he asked with a chuckle.  
  
  But of course Kat knew about the cameras. She suspected she knew more about every aspect of Colgan security than the headmaster did, but she didn't think this was the appropriate time to say so. There were too many witnesses. Too much was at stake. And, besides, the headmaster was already smiling triumphantly and dimming the lights with a remote control. Kat had to twist in her chair to see a section of the round wall sliding aside, revealing a large TV.  
  
  ""This young woman bears a striking resemblance to you, does she not, Ms. Bishop?"" As Kat watched the grainy  
  
  8  
  
  black-and-white video, she recognized the quad, of course, but she had never seen the person who was running across it wearing a black hooded sweatshirt. ""That's not me.""  
  
  ""But the dormitory doors were only opened once that night--at 2:27 a.m.--using a student identification card. This card."" Kat's stomach flipped as the single-worst picture she had ever taken appeared on the screen. ""This is your Colgan student I.D., is it not, Ms. Bishop?""  
  
  ""Yes, but--""  
  
  ""And this""--Headmaster Franklin reached beneath his seat--""was found during a search of your belongings."" The personalized license plate-- Colgan-1 --seemed to glow as he held it above his head.  
  
  It felt to Kat as though all the air had left the dim room as a strange feeling swept over her. After all, accused she could handle; wrongly accused was entirely new territory.  
  
  ""Katarina?"" Ms. Connors asked, as if begging Kat to prove them wrong.  
  
  ""I know that seems like a lot of very convincing evidence,"" Kat said, her mind working, gears spinning. ""Maybe too much evidence? I mean, would I really use my own I.D. if I'd done it?""  
  
  ""So since there is evidence that you did it, that should prove that you didn't do it?"" Even Ms. Connors sounded skeptical.  
  
  ""Well,"" Kat said, ""I'm not stupid.""  
  
  The headmaster laughed. ""Oh, well, how would you have done it?"" He was mocking her--baiting her--yet Kat couldn't help but think about the answer:  
  
  There was a shortcut behind Warren Hall that was closer and  
  
  9  
  
  darker and completely void of cameras. . . .  
  
  The doors wouldn't need an I.D. to open if you had enough Bubblicious to cover the sensor on your way out. . . .  
  
  If you're going to pull a prank of that nature, you don't do it the night before a morning when the maintenance staff will be awake long before the students. . . .  
  
  Headmaster Franklin smiled smugly, relishing her silence, as if he were so smart.  
  
  But Kat had already learned that people at Colgan were frequently wrong--like when her Italian teacher had said that Kat's accent would always make her stand out on the streets of Rome (even though Kat had already passed for a Franciscan nun during a particularly difficult job in Vatican City). She thought about how silly her History of Art teacher had sounded when she'd waxed poetic about seeing the Mona Lisa (when Kat knew for a fact that the Louvre's original had been replaced with a fake in 1862).  
  
  Kat had learned quite a lot of things before enrolling at the Colgan School--but the thing that she knew best was that this was the kind of place where she could never share them.  
  
  ""I don't know about Trinity or Bern or any of those European schools, young lady, but at the Colgan School we follow the rules."" The headmaster's fist banged the table. ""We respect the property of others. We adhere to the honor code of this institution and the laws of this country.""  
  
  But Kat already knew about honor. She'd grown up with her own set of rules. And the first rule of Katarina Bishop's family was simple: Don't get caught.  
  
  ""Katarina,"" Ms. Connors said, ""do you have anything to add that might explain this?""  
  
  Kat could have said, That's not me or There must be  
  
  10  
  
  some kind of mistake. The great irony was that if this had been an ordinary con, she could have lied her way through it without a second thought. But the truth? That, she wasn't so good at.  
  
  Her I.D. badge had been duplicated. The license plate had been planted in her room. Someone had dressed like her and made sure they were caught on camera.  
  
  She'd been framed. And Kat didn't dare say what she was thinking: that whoever had done it, they were very, very good.  
  
  Kat's bags were packed in twenty minutes. She might have lingered, saying her good-byes, but there were no good-byes to say. And so, after three months at Colgan, Kat couldn't help but wonder if the day she got expelled from boarding school might become the proudest moment of her family's long and colorful past. She imagined everyone sitting around Uncle Eddie's kitchen table years from now, telling about the time little Katarina stole a whole other life and then walked away without a trace.  
  
  Well, almost, Kat thought as she carried her bags past the once-perfect lawn. Ruts still tracked to and from the mangled fountain in the center of the quad: a muddy reminder that would no doubt last until spring.  
  
  She heard laughter coming from behind her, and turned. A group of eighth grade boys was standing together, whispering, until one bravely broke away from the pack.  
  
  ""Uh ..."" he started, then glanced back at his friends, summoning courage. ""We were wondering . . . um. How'd you do it?""  
  
  A stretch limo pulled through the ornate gates and up to the curb. The trunk popped open. As the driver started for her  
  
  11  
  
  bags, Kat looked at the boys and then back at Colgan one final time. ""That is an excellent question.""  
  
  The bells chimed. Students hurried between classes, across the quad. And as Kat crawled into the backseat of the limo, she couldn't help feeling slightly sad, or as sad as anyone could feel about losing something that wasn't rightfully theirs to begin with. She leaned back and sighed, ""Well, I guess that's over.  
  
  And it would have been ... if another voice hadn't said, ""Actually, it's just beginning.""  
  
  12  
  
  CHAPTER 2  
  
  Kat jumped. In the dim light, she hadn't noticed the figure sitting at the other end of the limo's bench, smiling back at her.  
  
  ""Hale?"" she asked as if the boy might be an imposter. But then a very different question crossed her mind. ""Hale, what are you doing here?""  
  
  ""I thoug  
ht you might need a ride.""  
  
  ""The headmaster's office called me a car.""  
  
  He shrugged, indifferent but amused. ""And here I am in a submarine.""  
  
  As the limo pulled out of the school's circular driveway, Hale turned and looked out the window. Kat watched him take in the grounds, a faint smile on his lips as if there were no place on earth he really had to be. Kat sometimes wondered if that  
  
  13  
  
  kind of self-assurance was something only very old money could buy. Then she wondered if it was something you could steal.  
  
  Hale waved as the gates of the Colgan School faded into the distance. ""Good-bye, Colgan!"" He turned to her. ""Hello, Kitty Kat.""  
  
  ""Hale, how did you know I was ...""  
  
  But Kat didn't finish. Suddenly, she wasn't in the back of a limo--she was sitting on a hard chair, staring at the black-and-white surveillance footage of someone in a hooded sweatshirt running across the quad. She was looking at the image of her own student I.D. magnified on a TV screen. She was watching Headmaster Franklin hold a crumpled vanity plate above his head for all to see.  
  
  ""Hale,"" Kat sighed. ""The headmaster's car? Really? That's not too clichéd for you?""  
  
  ""What can I say?"" He shrugged. ""I'm an old-fashioned guy. Besides, it's a classic for a reason."" He leaned against the window. ""It's good to see you, Kat.""  
  
  Kat didn't know what to say. It's good to see you too? Thanks for getting me kicked out? Is it possible you've gotten even hotter? I think I might have missed you?  
  
  So instead she settled on, ""Did my father put you up to this?""  
  
  Hale exhaled a quick laugh and shook his head. ""He hasn't returned my calls since Barcelona."" He leaned closer and whispered, ""I think he might still be mad at me.""  
  
  ""Yeah, well, that makes two of us.""  
Hey,"" Hale snapped. ""We all agreed that that monkey seemed perfectly well trained at the time.""  
  
  Kat simply shook her head. ""You got me kicked out, Hale."" He grinned and gave a slow bow. ""You're welcome.""  
  
  14  
  
  ""You trashed the headmaster's car.""  
  
  ""W. W. Hale the Fourth bought that car for Headmaster Franklin, or didn't they mention that? Granted, it was to make up for a fire that W. W. Hale the Fifth allegedly started in the eighth grade--before they suggested that all current and future W. W. Hales continue their educations elsewhere--which worked out just as well since I'm at the Knightsbury Institute now.""  
  
  ""I've never heard of it.""  
  
  ""My father got a letter just last week telling him that I have become a model student.""  
  
  ""Congratulations,"" Kat said, doubting it.  
  
  ""Yeah, well, I'm the only student."" He grinned a very Hale-like grin. ""Of course, the downside of attending a fictional school is that our lacrosse team sucks. Anyway, if the Colgan School wanted to be technical about it, I trashed my car.""  
  
  She studied W. W. Hale the Fifth. He looked older than sixteen, with messy light brown hair and golden skin, and a first name that, despite two years of effort, Kat had never learned.  
  
  ""I doubt they'd see it that way, Wesley?"" she guessed.  
  
  Hale smiled. ""Not. Even. Close.""  
  
  So far Kat had been through all the Wa's she could think of, but Hale hadn't admitted to being Walter or Ward or Washington. He'd firmly denied both Warren and Waverly. Watson had prompted him to do a very bad Sherlock Holmes impersonation throughout a good portion of a train ride to Edinburgh, Scotland. And Wayne seemed so wrong that she hadn't even tried.  
  
  Hale was Hale. And not knowing what the W's stood for had become a constant reminder to Kat that, in life, there are some things that can be given but never stolen.  
  
  Of course, that didn't stop her from trying.  
  
  15  
  
  ""So, how long before you broke into the student records office?"" Hale asked. ""A week?"" Kat felt her cheeks go red. ""But you didn't find anything on me, did you?"" He raised an eyebrow. ""Kat,"" he sighed her name. ""That is so sweet. And innocent. Naive looks good on you.""  
  
  ""Don't get used to it.""  
  
  He shook his head. ""Oh, I won't.""  
  
  The whisperlike purr of the engine filled the car as it snaked through the countryside. ""Why'd you do it, Hale?"" ""You don't belong in that place.""  
  
  ""Why'd you do it?"" she asked again, her patience wearing thin. ""I'm not joking, Hale."" ""Neither am I, Kat."" ""You've got--""  
  
  ""A job for you,"" Hale said. ""And only you,"" he added before she could protest.  
  
  The hills were growing steeper. Leaves scattered in the wind, and in the distance, the sun glistened off a lake. But Kat didn't take her eyes off Hale as she said, ""I don't want a job.""  
  
  ""You'll want this one.""  
  
  ""I'm out of the family business. Or haven't you heard?""  
  
  ""Fine."" Hale crossed his arms and sank deeper into the seat. He leaned his head back and closed his eyes. Kat could have sworn he was already half asleep when he asked, ""But are you out of the family?""  
  
  16  
  
  CHAPTER 3  
  
  Of all the houses the Hale family owned, W. W. Hale the Fifth's favorite wasn't the penthouse on Park Avenue (too pretentious), or the flat in Hong Kong (too noisy), or even the mansion on Martha's Vineyard (entirely too much sand). No, the youngest Hale was only truly fond of the old, six-hundred-acre estate in rural New York. At least, that was the only place where Kat had ever heard him say . . . ""We're home.""  
  
  The foyer was two stories tall and stretched in front of them for at least thirty feet. Hale walked ahead of her, hurrying past the Monet in the hall as if that would keep her from noticing it--or stealing it. He gestured toward the stairs. ""Marcus put you in the blue room. You can go upstairs if you want. Or we can go out to the veranda and have Marcus bring you  
  
  17  
  
  something to eat. Are you hungry? I didn't even ask. Do you want--""  
  
  ""I want you to tell me what's going on.""  
  
  After hours of watching the New England countryside roll by, and listening to Hale snore, Kat was finished with plotting and strategizing how to get her boarding school life back. She was out of options, so she called upon every thief's oldest and most trusted method for getting what she wants: Ask nicely.  
  
  ""Please, Hale.""  
  
  But he didn't answer. He was too busy walking down the main hall, guiding Kat into a dim room that she had never seen before. Moonlight cascaded through the windows that lined one wall. There were bookshelves and leather sofas, brandy decanters and the stale smell of old cigars and even older money. There was no doubt in Kat's mind that it was an important room. For important men. And yet Kat brushed past Hale without a second thought. . . until she saw the painting.  
  
  Stepping toward it was like approaching a window into another country, another century. She studied the rich colors and strong brushstrokes. ""It's beautiful,"" she whispered, staring at the work of an Old Master in the moonlight.  
  
  ""It's Vermeer.""  
  
  Kat turned to the boy who lingered in the doorway. ""It's stolen.""  
  
  ""What can I say?"" Hale eased behind her and studied the painting over her shoulder. ""I met a very nice man who bet me that he had the best security system in Istanbul."" His breath was warm on the back of her neck. ""He was mistaken.""  
  
  Kat stayed perfectly still as Hale walked to the desk in the far corner of the massive room, picked up a telephone and said, ""Marcus, we're home. Could you get some-- Yeah. The  
  
  18  
  
  library."" He held his hand over the receiver. ""Do you like corned beef?"" Kat glared at him, but he only smiled. ""She loves it!"" he exclaimed. He hung up and collapsed onto one of the leather sofas as if he owned the place, which, Kat had to remind herself, he did.  
  
  ""So,"" Hale said with a slow, easy grin, ""did you miss me?""  
  
  A good thief is always a great liar. It's part of the skill set, the tools, the craft. And at that moment, Kat thought it was probably a very good thing she'd walked away from the life, because when she said, ""No,"" Hale just smiled wider.  
  
  ""It really is good to see you, Kat.""  
  
  ""You might want to remember who I am before you try to con me.""  
  
  ""No."" Hale shook his head. ""You might want to remember who you are. You want to go back to Colgan, is that it? After I saved you from that place?""  
  
  ""Colgan wasn't so bad. I could have been normal at Colgan.""  
  
  Hale laughed. ""Trust me: you would never have been normal at Colgan.""  
  
  ""I could have been happy at Colgan.""  
  
  ""They kicked you out, Kat.""  
  
  ""Because you framed me!""  
  
  Hale shrugged. ""Fair enough."" He stretched his arms over the back of the couch. ""I sprung you because I've got a message for you.""  
  
  ""Doesn't your family own a cell phone company?""  
  
  ""Only a little one."" He held his fingers an inch apart to illustrate his point. ""Besides, it's more of a face-to-face kind of message.""  
  
  ""I thought my dad wasn't speaking to . . ."" She trailed off. Hale shook his head. And suddenly Kat understood everything  
  
  19  
  
  a little better. She dropped onto the couch opposite him and asked, ""So how is Uncle Eddie?""  
  
  ""He's good."" Hale nodded. ""He sends his love. He says the Colgan School will rob you of your soul."" She started to protest, but Hale stopped her. ""But that's not the message.""  
  
  ""Hale,"" Kat exhaled, growing weary.  
  
  ""Kat,"" Hale mimicked. ""Do you want to hear Uncle Eddie's message or not?""  
  
  ""Yes.""  
  
  ""He says he's got to give them back.""  
  
  ""What?"" Kat was sure she hadn't heard correctly. ""Uncle Eddie's got to give what--""  
  
  ""No. That is the message. And I quote. 'He's got to give them back.'""  
  
  Kat shook her head. ""I don't understand.""  
  
  ""There was a job, Kat. A week ago. In Italy.""  
  
  ""I haven't heard about any jobs,"" Kat insisted before remembering that she'd been out of the world. The loop. The life. She knew what the Colga  
n cafeteria was serving every day this month, but this . . .  
  
  ""Private collection,"" Hale continued. ""Very high-end paintings. Very high security. Very high risk. Two--maybe three--crews in the world could have done it, and--""  
  
  ""My dad's at the top of the list?""  
  
  Hale shook his head. ""There is no list. There's just--""  
  
  ""Dad."" Kat sat for a moment, thinking, then sighed. ""So?"" she asked. Suddenly it all seemed preposterous. ""So what? This is what he does, Hale. This is what we all do. What makes this time any different?""  
  
  She stood and started for the door, but in a flash, Hale was standing; his hand was around her wrist.  
  
  20  
  
  ""It's different because it's different, Kat. This guy--this guy with the paintings--he's a bad guy.""  
  
  ""I'm Bobby Bishop's daughter, Hale. I know a lot of bad guys.""  
  
  She tried to pull away, but Hale's chest was pressed against hers. His hands were warm against her skin. There was a new urgency in his voice as he whispered, ""Listen to me, Kat. He's not a bad guy like your dad and Uncle Eddie are bad guys."" He took a deep breath. ""Like I'm a bad guy. This guy? His name's Arturo Taccone, and he's a whole different kind of bad.""  
  
  In the two years since she'd met him, Kat had seen Hale wear a lot of expressions: playful, intrigued, bored. But she had never seen him scared before, and that, more than anything, made her shiver.  
  
  ""He wants his paintings back."" Hale's voice was softer now. The hard edge had left him, and something else had settled in its place. ""If he doesn't have them in two weeks, then ..."" Hale obviously didn't want to say what came next, which was just as well. Kat didn't want to hear it.  
  
  As she dropped back onto the sofa, Kat couldn't remember the last time she'd been speechless. Then again, she also couldn't remember the last time she'd been framed for a crime she didn't commit, kicked out of a boarding school that it had taken her three whole months to con her way into, and then, technically, kidnapped by a guy who could buy a Monet and yet couldn't resist stealing a Vermeer. Speechless seemed okay under the circumstances.  
  
  ""My dad used to be more careful than this,"" she said softly.  
  
  ""Your dad used to have you.""  
  
  Kat ate her corned beef sandwich. She drank some lemonade.  
  
  21  
  
  She was aware, faintly, of Hale watching her, but that was only because he was Hale, and the part of Kat that made her a girl wouldn't let her forget that he was in the room. Otherwise, she was as quiet as a church mouse. She would have made her family proud.  
  
  An hour later Marcus was leading Kat up the sweeping staircase, and Kat was staring, trying to guess whether the silver-haired man was closer in age to fifty or eighty. She was listening, trying to determine whether his accent was more Scottish than Welsh. But most of all, Kat was wondering why Marcus was the only servant she had ever seen orbiting around Planet Hale.  
  
  ""I've taken the liberty of putting you in Mrs. Hale's room, miss.""  
  
  Marcus opened a wide set of double doors, and Kat started to protest--the mansion had fourteen bedrooms, after all. But then Marcus switched on the lights, and Kat breathed in the stale air of a room that was clean but neglected. It had a king-size bed, a chaise lounge, and at least twenty silk-covered pillows, all in varying shades of blue. It was beautiful but sad, Kat thought. It needed to feel a beating heart.  
  
  ""If there is anything you need, miss,"" Marcus told her from the door, ""I'm number seven on the house phone.""  
  
  ""No,"" Kat mumbled. ""I mean, yes. I mean ... I don't need anything. Thank you.""  
  
  ""Very well, miss,"" he said, reaching for the doors.  
  
  ""Marcus?"" She stopped him. ""Have Hale's parents ... I mean Mr. and Mrs. Hale . . . How long will they be away?"" Kat asked, wondering which was sadder: having parents who've died or ones who've simply floated away.  
  
  ""The lady of the house will not be needing the room, miss.""  
  
  22  
  
  ""Are you ever going to call me Kat, Marcus?""  
  
  ""Not today, miss."" He repeated softly, ""Not today.""  
  
  He closed the door, and Kat listened to his footsteps receding down the long hallway. She lay down on Hale's mother's empty bed, the duvet cover cold against her skin. She felt very much alone in that big room, thinking about her dad and Uncle Eddie, about Porsche Speedsters and Monet.  
  
  Hours passed. Her thoughts blended together until they were like an Impressionist painting, and Kat knew she was too close to see anything plainly. She thought about crime, as she so often had in her fifteen years--ever since the day her father had told her he'd buy her ice cream if she would scream, and keep screaming until one of the guards outside the Tower of London left his post to see what was wrong.  
  
  She heard Hale's words: He used to have you.  
  
  Kat jumped from the bed and rifled through her bags until she found her passport. She flipped it open and saw the name Melanie O'Hara beside a picture of herself in a red wig. She dug again, flipped open another cover: Erica Sampson, a slender blonde. Three more tries yielded three more memories, until Kat found . . . herself.  
  
  She tucked those other girls away. For now. Then she picked up the phone and dialed. ""Marcus?""  
  
  ""Yes, miss,"" he replied, seeming too alert for four a.m.  
  
  ""I think I may need to leave.""  
  
  ""Of course, miss. If you'll look by the phone, you'll see I've already taken the liberty. ...""  
  
  Then Kat saw it--an envelope. A plane ticket. Eight a.m. first class to Paris.  
  
  23  
  
  CHAPTER 4  
  
  K at used to love Paris. She remembered being there with her parents--eating croissants, visiting a pyramid, and carrying six red balloons. It wasn't until years later that she realized it hadn't been a fun family outing--that actually they'd been casing the Louvre at the time. Still, the memories made her smile as she bought a pastry from her father's favorite cafe and carried it outside into the chilly wind. She shivered a little and wished she'd brought a warmer coat. Across the busy square, she saw the shop where her mother had bought her a pair of bright red patent leather shoes for Christmas. She wished a lot of things.  
  
  ""I know Uncle Eddie says he's in Paris, but it might take a day or two to find him,"" she'd told Marcus as he dropped her off at the airport.  
  
  24  
  
  ""Of course, miss,"" Marcus had said in a way that implied that he knew better; and somehow, as always, Marcus was right.  
  
  Bobby Bishop's name and address and phone number might be constantly changing, but Kat knew her father, and that, it turned out, was enough to track him down.  
  
  He was half a block away when she spotted him. The faintest hint of gray was settling into his dark hair, but it was still thick and slightly curly. He took long strides and kept the collar of his dark cashmere coat turned up against the wind as he walked--not too slow, not too fast--among the crowd.  
  
  Kat hurried back inside, bought a black coffee, and took the steaming cup outside, expecting to see him--to watch him stop in surprise at the sight of her. But when she returned to the street and scanned the crowd for his face and that familiar gait, he was gone. Had he passed her by? For a second she worried that she might not find him again. Or worse, that she might find him too late.  
  
  She set off in the direction he'd been going, and was about to call his name, when, on instinct, she stopped and turned around. There, in the center of the square, she saw him standing amid a large group of tourists, listening to a guide who was lecturing at the fountain's edge.  
  
  Her father didn't seem to notice her weaving through the hordes of tourists and scavenging pigeons. There were no hugs or cries of hello when she stepped up beside him.  
  
  ""I hope that's for me,"" her father said, but his gaze never left the man who was speaking to the group in rapid Russian.  
  
  Kat didn't know whether to feel annoyed or impressed by his casual tone--as if this were a standing date, and he'd been expecting her all along.  
  
  25  
  
  She handed him his coffee, watched him wrap cold hands around the warm cup. ""No gloves?"" she asked.  
  
  He smiled and sippe  
d. ""Not on my day off.""  
  
  Thieves aren't supposed to want too much--which is ironic, but true. Never live anyplace you can't walk away from. Never own anything you can't leave behind. These were the laws of Kat's life--of Kat's world. As she watched her father sip hot coffee and sneak smiles at her over the top of the cup, she knew that, strictly speaking, no thief is ever supposed to love anything as much as she loved him.  
  
  ""Hi, Daddy.""  
  
  Nearby, church bells started to ring. Pigeons scattered. And her father glanced at her from the corner of his eye and said, ""I know the Colgan School is good, honey, but Paris seems an awfully long way to come for a field trip.""  
  
  ""Yeah, I know, but it's fall break."" Kat didn't want to know why lying to her father was far easier than telling her headmaster the truth. ""I wanted to see how you were doing.""  
  
  Another sip. Another smile. But this time he didn't meet her eyes. ""You wanted to see if the rumors were true,"" he said, and Kat felt her face burn in the cold wind. ""So, who told?"" her father asked. ""Uncle Eddie? Hale?"" He shook his head and spoke through gritted teeth. ""I'm gonna kill that kid.""  
  
  ""It wasn't his fault.""  
  
  ""Like Barcelona wasn't his fault?""  
  
  ""Yeah, well . . ."" Kat heard herself repeating Hale's words: ""We all agreed that that monkey seemed perfectly well trained at the time.""  
  
  Her father scoffed.  
  
  ""Dad--""  
  
  ""Sweetheart, would you believe me if I said I didn't pull  
  
  26  
  
  any jobs in Italy last week?"" The bells stopped, and the guide resumed his lecture. Kat's father glanced around the square and lowered his voice. ""If I said I had an airtight alibi?""  
  
  ""You have an alibi?"" Kat asked. ""You swear?""

I (24 F) have been friend with Harry (29 M) for 3 years, He introduced me to Jack (28M) and Leo (27M) a few months ago and I became part of the group pretty fast (They are all gay). Jack and Leo started dating around 2 years ago and had been living together for 1 and a half till the broke up (Leo and Harry were friends long before Jack and Leo started dating). Now, here is the thing, Jack had lied to Leo since before they started dating (obviously he had lied to us too).
After them dating for more than a year Jack admitted SOME of the things he had lied about, I am not gonna tell you the lies but, for example, he said that he had a death brother that died in a car crash (lie). Leo forgave him but warned him that if he discovered any other lie they will be done. Guess what? Plenty of other lies and when Leo discovered those, he broke up with Jack. Obviously from my and Harry´s part we don’t trust him like nothing. Not only he lied but, when Leo broke up with him, he didn’t respect his wish of going no contact, he tried to use us, and other people, as bridge to reach him (obviously, it didn’t work). 
Harry and I met Jack for a coffee and we made it very clear that we don’t trust him, but that we can meet eventually. 
When they were together, the 4 of us bought a ticket to a concert in another city. Harry and I booked place to stay, and Jack and Leo were supposed to stay in the house were Jacks ‘cousin lived (lie, there is no cousin).
When they broke up it all fall apart, and we decided to divide into two groups (in other for them being apart from each other as long as they can). Jack and Leo have both been seen different people since they broke up, and Leo met up with a guy and he discovered that, when they were still together, Jack and that guy flirted, he cheated. Now, we did have our suspicions, but nothing confirmed. When he told us that it was over us. Now here comes the real AH part, they city is pretty far from where we live and we wanted to stay for an extra day to go to different places, but Jack didn’t wanna do it, when we confirmed the cheating we decided to change plans. Harry and I canceled our booking and booked something for Leo, Harry and Me and change our plane tickets, but we have not tell Jack yet, we are gonna tell him tomorrow. I kinda of feel bad but at the same time he did this to himself. He is a grown ass men.

PD: When they broke up, the next day, Jack meet with one of the persons we suspect he cheated with.

1mnl0ui,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1mnl0ui/60_days_of_daily_reading_fixed_my_brain_more_than/,60 days of daily reading fixed my brain more than any wellness trend ever did,"A few months ago, I came home from work, collapsed on my bed, and did what I always did: opened TikTok. “Just 10 minutes to decompress,” I told myself. An hour later, my eyes were burning, my brain felt like static, and my to-do list was still untouched. I wasn’t relaxed. I was numb. My focus was shot, my sleep was trash, and every spare moment felt like it needed to be filled with scrolling.

It scared me when I realized I couldn’t remember the last time I’d read a full book. And yet, every successful person I admire talks about two habits: reading and moving their body daily. I wanted in, but the gap between where I was and who I wanted to be felt impossible.

Then I read Atomic Habits. One line hit me like a truck: “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.” I didn’t need to fix my whole life overnight. I just needed to tweak the system.

So I ran an experiment:
– 10-minute walk after dinner.
– One short workout a week if I felt like it.
– Replace TikTok with 15 minutes of reading every night.

I even swapped the TikTok icon with my reading app so my muscle memory worked for me. I also started stacking audiobooks with stuff I already did, while cleaning, commuting, even in the shower.

The first week was brutal. I still caught myself unlocking my phone and tapping the empty spot where TikTok used to be. But somewhere around week three, the cravings started to fade. My brain stopped needing micro-dopamine hits from 10-second videos. Stories and ideas began to feel more satisfying than swipes.

After 60 days, I’d finished 8 books (I’d read 2 total last year), my attention span doubled, and my mind felt…quiet. Like I could hear my own thoughts again.

Here’s what actually worked for me (learned from trial, error, and some therapist-approved habit science):
  -Swap the cue, not just the habit. Replacing an app in the exact spot your brain expects it is a cheat code.
  -Read fun, short stuff first. Lower friction, build momentum.
  -Stack habits. Pair reading with tea, skincare, or
   your commute.
  -Audiobooks = still reading. Ignore the purists.
  -Make the book impossible to miss. Desk,
   nightstand, or even as your lock screen.
  -Track books finished, not hours read.
  -Achievement triggers dopamine.
Don’t expect instant miracles. Your brain needs ~21–60 days to recalibrate dopamine pathways.
Some resources that helped me massively (besides therapy):

During this time, I read some great books to rebuild my focus, and surprisingly, made me actually enjoy learning again. Starting with Atomic Habits by James Clear – NYT bestseller, 10M+ copies sold. Clear distills habit science into strategies you can actually stick to. This book will make you see motivation in a totally new way. Another must-read is Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport – from the author of Deep Work. This will make you rethink your entire tech diet. I closed Instagram for a week right after reading it. Game changer. I also highly recommend The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle – 5M+ copies sold, spiritual classic. This book will make you realize how much of your anxiety is controlling you.

When it comes to tools, BeFreed has been a game changer for me. A friend introduced me to this smart reading app built by scientists from Columbia U and I’m hooked. You can choose between quick 10 or 20 minute summaries or full 40 minute deep dives and even customize your reading host’s voice and tone (mine has that smoky Samantha from Her vibe, dangerously addictive). It creates a personalized learning roadmap based on your goals, struggles, and how your brain works. I’ve been knocking out books on discipline, psychology, and investing while walking or making coffee. I never thought I’d crave reading, but it gives me the same dopamine hit as scrolling and now I’m hooked on knowledge instead.

Another helpful app is Forest, where you plant a virtual tree that grows as you stay off your phone. It’s weirdly effective when paired with 15–20 minute reading sessions. And for movement, MadFit (YouTube) is my go-to: low effort, high reward workouts that pair perfectly with an audiobook. I’ve “read” whole books while doing her 20-min routines.

Replacing social media with reading didn’t just make me “productive”, it gave me back my ability to think clearly. Big tech platforms are literally engineered to hijack your dopamine system: infinite scroll, autoplay, notifications timed for max re-engagement. Over time, this rewires your brain to crave constant novelty and kills your ability to focus deeply. Reading reverses that. It forces you to slow down, follow a narrative, and rebuild your mental endurance.

If you feel stuck, burnt out, or like your attention span is fried, this is your sign. Start with one page. One paragraph. One short story before bed. You’re not broken; your brain just needs a different diet. The smartest, happiest people I know all have two habits: they read daily, and they move daily. Build that system for yourself, and watch who you become.

1mnl0gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PakistanBookClub/comments/1mnl0gw/the_night/,THE NIGHT,"
The night is a cruel custodian of longing, stretching time into a heavy, slow-moving river where absence thickens the air like the scent of old books in an abandoned library. Shadows creep along the walls, whispering the names of those who once filled the spaces now left hollow. You listen, half-dreaming, half-remembering, uncertain whether the voices belong to memory, or some phantom echo trapped in the folds of time.
And so, it begins.
The day unfurls with a deceptive lightness, the sun rising with a practiced indifference, spilling gold onto streets that no longer belong to you. People move through their routines with the precision of clockwork figures, each gesture rehearsed, each smile a flicker on the surface of something vast and unknowable. You mimic them—drinking coffee, exchanging pleasantries, nodding in all the right places—yet beneath your skin, the ache lingers, coiled and patient. It is the quiet hum beneath the world’s noise, the invisible thread stitching together past and present. Is this existence, or merely an approximation of it? You begin to suspect that life is not a sequence of events but rather a series of images, looping endlessly, distorting themselves, blurring the distinction between what was and what is imagined.
The hours pass, but time itself feels slippery, unreliable, like sand slipping through fingers you can no longer feel. You catch yourself glancing at your phone, seeking proof of your own existence in the form of a message, a missed call, a sign that somewhere, someone is thinking of you. But the screen stares back with an indifference not unlike the sun’s, and you realize—perhaps with some degree of horror—that the world has continued without you, as if your presence was never integral to its mechanics. The weight of irrelevance settles over you, a quiet despair wrapped in the mundane. You curse yourself for expecting anything different, for craving something as trivial as acknowledgement. How pathetic it is, this hunger for validation, for proof that you are more than an afterthought.
And then the night arrives.
This is when the silence turns cavernous, swallowing sound, swallowing self. The city hums in the distance, but in your room, the air is thick with ghosts. The past becomes tangible—more real than the present—woven into the fabric of the dark like invisible threads that bind you to what was. You try to sleep, but sleep has long abandoned you. Instead, you wander through your mind’s labyrinthine corridors, opening doors that should have remained shut. Faces emerge from the fog of forgetting, voices sharpen, and the scent of a memory fills the space around you. It is not just missing—it is inhabiting the ache, surrendering to it, becoming one with its rhythm. You hate yourself for it, for this weakness, for this insatiable need to linger in what no longer exists.
You reach for the past, but it slips away, elusive as mist. You remember the shape of a hand, the curve of a smile, the way laughter used to fill the space between words—but the details blur, the edges dissolve. You panic, as if losing the sharpness of memory means losing yourself, as if each forgotten fragment is another piece of your being hollowed out, making room for nothingness. But then you begin to wonder: was it ever real at all? Could memory be nothing more than an intricate fiction, a narrative crafted to make sense of absence? If the past is an invention, then what of the self? Are you anything more than a compilation of recollections, a patchwork of ephemeral impressions destined to fade? And if so, what remains when those impressions finally disappear?
And then, the self-talk begins. The voice is not quite yours, not anymore. It speaks in a tone devoid of cruelty yet brimming with certainty, reminding you that you are unravelling. It tells you that time will swallow you whole, that soon you will be nothing more than a whisper in someone else's fading recollections. It is not a voice of malice—it is simply the voice of inevitability. And perhaps that is the cruellest revelation of all: not that you are disappearing, but that disappearance is the natural order of things. The world is an endless succession of forgettings, and you are merely one more instance of it. You laugh bitterly—perhaps you deserve to be forgotten. Perhaps you were never meant to be remembered at all.
The night does not end. It stretches, seamless, eternal. The sun may rise, but it is only an illusion of renewal. Each morning, you wake a little less whole, a little more translucent, as if the act of longing is eroding you. You have become a ghost haunting your own life, a figure at the edges of existence, weightless, formless, slowly dissolving into the folds of time. The world continues, and you remain—unseen, unheard, suspended in a dream that refuses to break. And in the back of your mind, a whisper emerges—a thought too cruel to voice: you did this to yourself. You wove your own prison from these threads of longing, and now you will never escape.
And so, the cycle continues.
You ache. You remember. You forget.

1mnl0fz,https://i.redd.it/tnsfhva5ofif1.png,Five-Year Lie: I Was His Secret Test Wife. Does anyone know where I can find a free link for this story to read online?,"# Chapter1

I married Logan Kingsford when he had nothing—unless you count the “tens of millions” he called debt.

For five years I worked three jobs.

I kept the lights on, paid down every last dollar, and raised our son, Sterling.

I didn’t complain. I believed the grind would end.

Last week, his company secured a massive investment, and we held each other, celebrating.

I thought the good days had finally arrived.

Today, I saw him on Halcyon Financial News.

In a tailored suit, he was hailed as the sole heir to a hundred-billion-dollar empire, chatting amiably with his investor, Celeste Whitmore.

The headline read, “Kingsford Heir Completes Five-Year Austerity Stunt, ‘Proves Himself’ to the Board.”

I stumbled home in a daze.

My five-year-old son, Sterling Kingsford, was playing with the latest limited-edition robot.

He looked up at me with the same cold, unfamiliar eyes as his father.

“Dad already told me.”

“Mom, you failed the test. You care too much about money.”

The words were a cold bullet, piercing my ears and detonating in my skull.

I looked at Sterling, the child I had brought into the world, as he fiddled with the limited-edition robot I had earned by pulling three all-nighters doing freelance design.

On that face so like Logan’s was a chill I had never seen, something no five-year-old should have owned.

“Sterling, what are you talking about?”

My throat tightened. Every word was unbearably hard to force out.

“Dad already told me.”

“Dad said truly noble women do not keep talking about money. You count every dollar on the utility bills, run two blocks for a supermarket discount, and get mad when I break a toy.”

“I wasn’t mad. I was just…”

“Dad said that is being narrow-minded.” He cut me off, repeating it in an icy monotone. “He said you only see petty short-term gains. Your love is too cheap, and too heavy.”

My heart was crushed in an invisible fist until I could not breathe.

Every penny I saved for this family, all the pride I sacrificed to pay off Logan’s tens of millions in debt, the burn on my arm from late-night shifts at QuickMart, the vertigo after dozens of hours of overtime at Grayline Design Studio.

All of it, everything I had given, became small-minded and money-obsessed in the eyes of that father and son.

I crouched to take his hand; he recoiled from me in disgust.

“Do not touch my robot. You cannot afford it.”

I could not afford it. The receipt still lay quietly in my wallet.

I opened my mouth, but nothing came out.

I stood up in a fog, staggered back two steps, and hit the cold wall.

My eyes swept the living room and finally settled on the coffee table.

A document and a check rested there in silence.

Divorce Agreement.

Logan’s signature already sprawled across it, bold and flamboyant, just like the swagger he wore on the financial news.

Beside it sat a check.

So this was my severance pay for five years of youth, multiple jobs, and countless sleepless nights.

The ridiculous part was that last week, right here, we had hugged and celebrated, and he had said, “Evelyn, the hard days are over. I will make you the happiest woman in the world.”

Looking back now, that had been the final line before the test ended.

My phone shrieked, the screen flashing Husband.

I answered numbly.

“Did you see it?” Logan’s voice came through the receiver without a trace of warmth.

“Evelyn Hart, our Heir’s Trial is over. Congratulations on going the distance with me. Unfortunately, you did not make the cut.”

“A test?”

I finally found my voice, dry as sandpaper.

“Yes, a test.” He gave a soft laugh, thick with mockery. “I had to prove to the Kingsford Board of Directors that even at rock bottom I could attract a loyal partner and build from scratch. Celeste Whitmore is my investor and my real fiancée. You were the a contracted placeholder wife I selected at random to complete this social experiment.”

“So those tens of millions in debt…”

“Oh, just another way to say seed capital. If I had not called it that, how could we have tested character under extreme pressure?”

“Logan Kingsford.” I forced out each word, my nails digging deep into my palm. “You are a bastard.”

“Am I? This bastard is now the heir to hundreds of billions. Evelyn, take the check and leave with dignity. Do not make me despise your last act.”

He paused, then added something even crueler.

“By the way, Sterling is not your son. He was conceived through IVF with Celeste and me. What you and I started was replaced.”

“You were only a performer in the outsourced caregiving phase of his upbringing. The true lady of the house is coming back now. Move out of this Kingsford home immediately.”

“Did you not say we turned to IVF because overwork made natural conception impossible…”

In that instant I felt plunged into an ice pit.

“Celeste and the Kingsford legal team will arrive in half an hour. They will handle the handover with you. Remember to keep it dignified.”

He did not listen at all.

The call cut off.

I clutched the phone like a piece of red-hot iron.

Outsourced caregiving.

So even my qualification to be a mother had been granted by them, and taken back by them.

# Chapter2

I did not move.

I would not leave just like that.

What belonged to me, I would take back piece by piece with my own hands.

The doorbell rang ten minutes earlier than the time Logan had promised, impatient and insistent.

I opened the door, and there she stood, the smiling society darling from the financial news, Celeste Whitmore.

Two men in suits stood behind her, likely from the Kingsford legal team.

“Hello, Ms. Hart.”

Celeste spoke, her gentle voice a knife wrapped in velvet.

She did not come in swaggering; instead she looked me over with a pitying air.

“These five years have been so hard on you. Honestly, you did even better than I expected. The performance felt very real.”

She said it as she brushed past me and walked straight into the living room, as if she were the true mistress of the house.

“Sterling, Mommy Celeste is here.”

Sterling dropped his robot at once and leapt into her arms like a kitten.

“Mommy Celeste, you came!”

With practiced ease, Celeste took a small box of butterscotch candy from her Chanel handbag, unwrapped one, and popped it into Sterling’s mouth.

“Of course. I promised that as soon as Dad’s game ended, I would take you home. This weekend we will go to Liberty Kingdom Theme Park, all right?”

“Yay. I like Mommy Celeste best.”

They cooed and cuddled in front of me as if they were the real family, while I was nothing more than a temp actress whose scene had ended.

My heart had already gone numb enough not to feel pain.

Holding Sterling, Celeste looked around, and her gaze landed on the fabric sofa set I had found at ThriftWay Market.

She frowned slightly, as if she had seen something dirty.

“Logan is unbelievable. How could he let you live in a place like this and use such cheap furniture? These things do not belong in his home.”

She turned to the men behind her. “Mr. Blake, make a note. Have a cleaning crew come and throw out every piece of furniture here. House Kingsford does not allow cheap goods.”

“Understood, Ms. Whitmore.”

Every sentence precisely erased the work of my past five years.

I had pinched every penny for our shared future.

In her eyes, it was nothing but cheap junk staining her fiancé’s noble status.

The man she called Mr. Blake stepped up to me and handed me a pen with bureaucratic efficiency.

“Ms. Hart, please sign the Divorce Agreement. Five million in compensation is already the industry’s highest standard for a five year role playing project. Mr. Kingsford and Ms. Whitmore are being very generous.”

“The industry’s highest standard?”

I repeated the words, finding them absurd.

They had priced my life like a commodity on a shelf.

“Yes.” Adam Blake adjusted his glasses. “Additionally, Ms. Whitmore is kind hearted. She asked me to remind you not to engage in any further entanglement. Any such conduct will be treated by our legal department as a hostile provocation against the entire Kingsford family. I imagine you would not want to see that outcome.”

His words carried an undisguised threat.

Celeste came over with Sterling in her arms, a perfect smile on her face.

“Do not misunderstand, Ms. Hart. We are not threatening you. You are a smart woman. You know the best option for yourself, don’t you?”

She lowered her head and spoke softly to Sterling.

“Baby, say goodbye to her. She is leaving our home.”

Sterling peeked out of her arms and looked at me.

The eyes that had once relied on me now held only boredom and impatience.

“Mommy Celeste, let’s go. I do not want to see her. Dad said the stink of poverty on her would rub off on me.”

The stink of poverty.

The words shattered the last thin film of tenderness I had kept for them.

I looked at them and suddenly laughed.

# Chapter3

My laugh stunned Celeste Whitmore and Mr. Blake.

They had likely pictured me crying, raging, hurling curses, even throwing my dignity off to beg. They had not expected me to laugh.

“What are you laughing at?”

Celeste’s brows knit again.

“Nothing.” I stopped laughing.

My face went flat and still as a dead lake. “I just think how excellent your performance was.”

I turned into the bedroom and dragged several storage bins out from under the bed.

I had bought them a few days ago to swap out seasonal clothes and welcome the new life I thought was coming when our hard years ended.

“Oh, so finally, you get it. Ready to pack up and get out?”

Arms folded, Celeste leaned on the doorframe, her voice dripping with mockery.

I ignored her.

I began to sort, methodically, page by page, all the evidence from my five years.

I printed every bank statement from my three jobs.

I laid out my own credit card bills and every single charge on the secondary card attached to Logan Kingsford’s supposedly debt ridden account.

Celeste’s expression shifted from scorn to confusion, then to a flicker of caution.

“Evelyn, what exactly are you doing? You are not trying to shake us down with that stack of paper, are you? It will not work. We have the best legal team.”

I still said nothing.

From a dedicated document pouch, I took out a thick bundle of records.

Then I brought out the final piece, the purchase record and receipt for Sterling’s Sparky X Limited Edition Robot.

The receipt listed my name.

The payment account was my payroll checking.

I placed that receipt gently on top of everything, like stamping a final seal on my five absurd years.

When I finished, I shut the lids.

Three full bins.

There were no clothes inside, no shoes, no makeup. Only my blood, sweat, time, and a life that had been ground into worthlessness.

I raised my head and looked at Celeste and Mr. Blake.

“I am taking these with me.”

Adam Blake clearly found me unreasonable. “Ms. Hart, these are household expense records. You have no right to remove them unilaterally. They cannot serve as grounds for asking for additional compensation.”

“Who said I wanted more compensation”

I asked it back.

I looked at Celeste.

She stared at me as if I were crazy, the curl of her mouth an undisguised sneer.

“You’re beyond help. You really do only care about money. Evelyn, you are hopeless.”

“Yes.” I nodded, admitting it without flinching. “I am incorrigible. I only trust money.”

That’s because in this world, money was the one thing that would not betray me. I hauled the heavy bins of so called waste paper to the entryway and put on my shoes.

From start to finish, I did not look at Sterling again.

I took only my ID, passport, bank cards, and these boxes that mattered more than my life.

When I pulled the door open and was about to walk out of the home I had worked for five years to keep alive, Celeste spoke behind me in a voice neither loud nor soft, just clear enough for me to hear, to Sterling.

“See, baby, Your Mommy Celeste was right. A woman like that does not deserve to be your mother. In her world, there is only money.”

The door clicked shut, and I heard their laughter.

# Chapter4

I dragged three heavy bins and wandered the streets of New Avalon like a ghost.

Dusk settled, and the warm lights behind every window felt like they were mocking my homelessness.

I found a budget motel called Sunset Inn and tried to check in with the few thousand dollars left on my card.

“I am sorry, ma’am, your card has been frozen.”

I tried another card.

“I am sorry, still not working.”

I ran every card in my wallet, including credit cards. The result was the same.

“Frozen.” A chill shot from my soles to the crown of my head.

Logan Kingsford had gone all the way.

He did not just throw me out. He cut off every path I could take.

I was about to leave with my bins when a Black Town Car stopped at the motel entrance.

“Ms. Hart, we meet again.”

It was Mr. Blake.

His face was expressionless, as precise as a machine.

“Is there anything I can help?” My voice came out hoarse.

“Just a quick update.” He handed me a document. “Given that this afternoon you maliciously stole financial materials related to the Kingsford Heir’s Trial, namely the bins of receipts you removed, your actions created potential risk to the project. Therefore Mr. Kingsford has decided to revoke your five million severance.”

My head rang.

Malicious theft.

He called the evidence I had compiled with my own blood and sweat theft.

“In addition,” Mr. Blake seemed to relish my expression.

He produced another document, one painfully familiar because I had signed it five years ago.

Back then Logan told me it was our prenuptial agreement, something to protect me even after his supposed bankruptcy.

My breath stalled.

Mr. Blake flipped to a page and pointed to a clause printed in smaller type, reading it to me word by word.

“Supplement 3.1. The a contracted placeholder wife performed by Party B, Evelyn Hart, and the mother duties she fulfilled, are part of this project. The child in her care, Sterling Kingsford, is the biological issue of Party A, Logan Kingsford, and the project investor, Celeste Whitmore, obtained through lawful surrogacy. Party B served only as caregiver and holds no legal parental rights.”

In that instant my world collapsed to dust.

I had always believed Sterling was the baby I had carried after endless injections and IVF, the child I had nearly died to bring into the world.

It turned out even the most basic blood tie was a lie.

My body shook so hard I could barely stand.

Mr. Blake did not stop. He turned to the most lethal final page.

“Supplement 7.4. All contributions by Party B during the five year period, including but not limited to housework, emotional support, and childrearing, are defined in essence as Party B’s labor under the project. The compensation is a trust fund of five million dollars to be established by Party A upon project completion.”

He paused, then delivered the outcome in a voice like a death sentence.

“But Party B was graded not qualified in the project’s final evaluation. Under Clause 7.5, the beneficiary of the trust fund was legally transferred to Ms. Celeste Whitmore at three o’clock this afternoon.”

He closed the file and held it out to me.

“So, Ms. Hart.”

“All of this was for a test you did not pass. You now have nothing. Including what you thought was yours. Your son. Your love. The money you believed you had earned.”

“Nothing was yours.”

I looked at him, at the agreement, at the signature I had written with my own hand.

My life, the love I had been proud of, the family I had given everything to, had been an elaborate commercial game I had never been told about, designed from the start, and finally graded a failure.

They had used the legal document I had signed to cast me into a hell without end.

I could not hold myself up any longer. My knees gave out and I dropped straight down.

All other sounds vanished. I heard only the shatter of my own heart.

Despair rose like a tide and swallowed me whole.

I did not know how I left the motel.

I remembered only Mr. Blake and his colleague looking at me on my knees like trash, then getting in the car and speeding off.

I drifted through the night streets like the living dead, dragging those three bins of heavy jokes.

My bank cards had been frozen as if I had failed in a business contract.

I had less than a hundred in cash. I could not get a room. I could not go home. The world was vast, and there was no place in it for Evelyn Hart.

My mind tottered on the brink of collapse. Just when I thought I would break or pass out on the sidewalk, an image flashed in my head.

Logan Kingsford, do you not love playing poor

Then be truly poor.

1mnkz7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/desksetup/comments/1mnkz7t/looking_for_honest_feedback_would_india_buy_a/,Looking for honest feedback — would India buy a full grain leather desk mat that actually ages like an heirloom?,"I’ve been quietly working on something for the past few months — a project born out of my frustration with cheap, disposable desk mats. Most are synthetic, peel within a year, and just don’t age well. I wanted to create something different — a desk mat that could last decades, improve with age, and maybe even become a family heirloom. That’s how Founder's Reserve was born.  
\# What We’re Building  
\- A premium desk mat made from: Full-grain chrome-tanned coffee-brown leather — the kind that develops a beautiful patina over time.  
\-Handmade finish with rounded edges — each piece unique. 33 × 17 inches — big enough for your laptop, keyboard, mouse, and notebook  
\-Durable cork backing — protects your desk and stays flat.

The goal is to start with this, then slowly add matching leather mouse pads, coasters, and catch-all trays — all in the same Founder’s Reserve finish so your setup feels cohesive.  
\#Why I’m Posting Here  
Before I commit to a larger batch, I’d love to hear from people who actually care about desk setups:  
\-Would you buy something like this at ₹2,999?  
\- What colors or leather finishes would you prefer?  
\-What would make a premium desk mat worth it for you?

Even a quick comment or upvote helps me understand if this idea has legs in India. Photos of the prototype are ready and I’ll post them in the comments.

1mnkxx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mnkxx8/black_sulphur_springs/,Black Sulphur Springs,"

	Last weekend, and the proceeding days, have affected me in ways I’m not sure I can see unless I write them down. Only accounting for this week, today was like every other day. I woke up, went to work, hated it, and came home to silently but concerningly observe my boyfriends behavior. It has been extremely routine, and we haven’t talked much. 
	
	When I get up for work, he’s already left. When he arrives home after me, he’s been, well… soaking wet. Dripping through the house, then, he’s already in the bathroom showering, and goes to bed immediately after. His demeanor seems content, and it has been considerably hot out recently. It would be possible that he’s been sweaty and tired for five or six days. It would be possible to me, if I’d spoken more than a few words to him in that time. 
	
	The few brief conversations we have usually abruptly end the same way; “I’m tired but, we should go back to the hot springs this weekend.” The last thing I want to hear. 

	Black Sulphur Springs is just a few hours away from our house. It’s a bit of a local secret, and usually not busy due to it being at least a 2 hour drive on switchback logging roads. It used to be one of my favorite spots. There’s a small shack over the deepest pool, and a few shallow outdoor pools that connect into a creek. An ideal camping get away, and I’m praying I will never have to go back. 

	I’m going to try to convey the course of events while at Black Sulphur Springs, as best I can. I already feel like I’ve lost some of it, but I think I need help. 
	
	I didn’t get off work until 6:00 last Saturday, and we got a bit of a late start so we didn’t make it there until around 10:00pm. It was getting dark, and we pulled up to the campground closest to the springs to see if anyone was in the shack, or outdoor pools. We didn’t see anyone, but could hear sudden splashing and a man’s voice; “Come see for yourself!” In a non-threatening tone. Must be occupied.
	
	We decide to go to farthest camp site, just over a small hill. The walk is only about 10-15 minutes. We like the privacy. 
      
	It doesn’t matter how many times I’ve been camping, or how many guns my boyfriend brings, in this case two. It’s always been a slightly stressful experience for me. I’ve got anxiety, could even say paranoia. I’ve always been able to have a good time though. Even when constantly scanning my surroundings and listening to every twig snap through the night. Arriving at night did not help, but I was happy and excited to finally be there. 
	
	Everything was going great at first. After we set up the tent and blankets, got the fire going, we were so excited to try out our new camping chairs. I splurged and got a camp recliner, which turned out to be less of a chair and more of an almost vertical hammock.  Almost impossible to sit in and not look at the stars, as it sucks you in while letting your ass and lower back nearly scrape the ground. He tries to cheer me up, in case I’m scorned over my $80 purchase;

“You can sit in my chair when you want to look at the fire.” 

It worked, I chuckled and was a little relieved knowing full well I was taking his chair. 
	
	Before he pulls his chair out of the bag, I see a glimpse of the label; “Little Adventurer”. Right as I exclaim my findings, he pulls it out and flicks it open in one motion. The chair is probably a foot tall and two feet wide. 

“Weird name for a camp chair.” I say smugly, but inevitably take the toddler seat. 
	
	We made hotdogs and joked around the fire for about an hour, as it grew darker I became slightly more jumpy and restless. 

“Wanna check out the hot springs? It might be empty now.” I asked with anticipation. 

“Sure, let’s grab some firewood on the way back. I didn’t bring any but most of those other camp spots were empty.” 
	
	We headed down the road with our flashlights, the night was quiet and calm. There was actually only one other camper, one in an RV. As we approach the main parking lot and entrance to the springs, we notice a car parked in one of the exits of the parking lot. It was pointing as if it were leaving the parking lot, but empty and not running. 
	
	As we came closer, we noticed all the windows were down. He pointed his flash light at the car, and we see there are no windows at all. They’ve all been broken. As we make it around the front of the car, we see the windshield is completely collapsed and the driver side mirror is dangling by its wires. 
	
	“Holy shit.” He said, more interested than concerned. 
	
	“What’s that stain?” I noticed something brown had poured out of the passenger side and down the outside door panel. 
	
	“Blood?” 
	
	“Could be coffee” I say “looks like a roll over?” 
	
	“How did they get it here though?”
	
	He had a valid point, if you rolled anywhere on this road for 20 miles in either direction, you would not be getting the vehicle back. If you did, why would they drop it here?  The car was pretty much empty, no blood or coffee on the inside.
	 The campground had been quiet this whole time so we were hopeful the shack was empty, but we heard quiet splashing as we approached. 
	
	“Should we just try in the morning?” He asked.
	
	I nodded, and we took another bewildered look at the car before heading back.  We collected large sticks, and he barbarically carried a few small stumps back to the camp to burn as well. We never strayed far from the road, not that I would have. The woods were honestly so quiet, and peaceful. No twigs snapping in the distance, no fire crackling but ours. The creek was so distant, the hill almost completely silenced it.
	
	 We found ourselves whispering the rest of the night, as if to not offend the dead silence. Until, that is, we hear a familiar voice in the distance; “Come see for yourself!” Initially I was not concerned but began to internally question If I would even be able to hear the other camper from their campsite across the hill. It didn’t happen again, so I chose to keep it to myself. 
	
	The closer it got to bedtime, the more I began thinking about how long I’ll lay awake. Hyper-focusing on every snap, crunch, and whistle of the forest and imagining the best defense mechanism for every possible scenario. It all feels pretty normal to me, but he didn’t seem to think so, and confronted me about regularly scanning the areas beyond the fire with my flash light. 

	“Just turn it off, it’s fine there’s almost no one else here. “

	“I know...” I turn off the flashlight. 

	“Plus, if any critters come out, I have these if we need them.” He motioned to his revolver in his bag, and his lever gun placed beside him. 

	“I know, are they loaded?” 
	I asked, knowing that I hoped they were in case of emergency, but was also uncomfortable. Because they are loaded guns. They just make me nervous, like everything else. 

	“There isn’t a bullet in the chamber so they can’t go off, once I cock them they can be fired. They won’t be though.” he chuckled slightly at the end.He showed and demonstrated with the lever gun, which was comforting. 
	
	“I wish you’d put one in my chamber.” I joked.
	
	 I had to lighten the mood the only way I know how. He snorted and shoved me, asking if I’m ready for bed. I agree, and we go to sleep in the tent. 
	
	He put the revolver in a built in pouch in the tent on his side, right by his head. He laid the lever gun on the ground next to him. My side of the makeshift blanket-bed faced the fire, and the door. The amber lighting and not being next to effectively a giant blind spot, made me feel content.  
	
	I fell asleep shockingly fast. Sometime later I woke up for a moment, the lighting from the fire was at half mass. It is so, so silent and still out. The fire is the only noise I can isolate, and even it’s quiet. It’s ideal, and I doze off again. 
	
	I remember waking up again from a noise, somewhat startled and my eyes fogged over. Almost a little grumbling sound, maybe? It’s silent for a couple seconds and my eyes barely adjust, when I hear it again. I can immediately identify the noise as the zipper of the entrance of the tent, right by my feet. It wasn’t at a hurried pace and only unzipped maybe an inch or so. I couldn’t look down, paralyzed in fear. I swing my left arm rapidly against his chest to wake him. 

	“What?” He whispers groggily.  

	“Something is unzipping the tent” I say, not looking at him, or at my feet, but straight up at the ceiling of the tent.  

	He grabs his lever gun off the ground, kneels with it for a moment, and exits the tent. 
	This is when my memory gets the fuzziest, I was sitting up at one point, waiting for him to return. I was laying down at one point too, looking at his side of the bed, empty. Then I awoke suddenly, the fire completely out, I look to my left and see him laying next to me. Sleeping, peacefully I watch him for several minutes, I must have groggily decided it was a dream and didn’t want to wake him. 
	
	The dead silence is broken again, by rain. It is gentle at first, but rapidly grows harsher. He wakes up briefly, we look at each other for a moment, and fall asleep, this time, for the rest of the night. 
	
	He wakes me up in the morning after he’s started the fire, we make some breakfast and I half jokingly bring up my dream. 
 
	“I had a weird dream, well I think it was a dream.”

	“Oh?”

	“Yeah, uh I thought I heard someone unzipping the tent, and woke you up?” 

	“Oh, nope I don’t think so.”

	“Okay, cool you would definitely remember, you went outside and checked. In the dream.” 

	“Yeah you’re good, I wouldn’t ever leave the tent.”

	“Good to know.” We laugh off the absurdity, and during a pause he goes back in the tent. He grabs his lever gun, when he comes out he motions to me, 

	“See, if I would have had-‘

	He pauses for just a moment while looking down, and I already knew what he was going to say. 

	“…there’s one in the chamber.” I can tell he’s serious, not overly concerned but was telling the truth.

	“You grabbed the lever gun too, in the…dream.”

	“I wouldn’t have gone out of the tent…it is weird though.” He tries to sound reassuring.
 	
	We make our way to the hot springs, it’s about 6:00 am so we’re hopeful it’s empty. Once we make it to the parking lot we see the white and green trucks that say “Law Enforcement” on the side, and several officers putting caution tape around the car, some taking pictures. We pass by them, they look us over but say nothing. 
	
	The shack is empty, so we soak for about an hour. By the time we were done, the parking lot was still just as busy with work instead of recreation. We passed by and one of the officers briefly asked, 

“You guys alright?” 

“Yep!” We both reply. 
	
	He beats my pace back to the camp, a little rude but it’s not a habit. We just packed up and left. We listened to the radio the whole way back, and didn’t really speak. He seemed fine though, I wasn’t concerned until we got home.
	
	We unpacked, and he spent a few hours throwing up in the yard. I suppose he didn’t want to keep our only bathroom occupied. Thoughtful. Which made me feel even more sympathy for him. I tried my hardest stand with him. I didn’t make it very long. 
	
	I felt so bad, I repeatedly tried to give him water, but I could never be out there for more than a few moments. It made the air around him thick and reek of decay. It was like, roadkill and rotten eggs. His body contorts and his ribs flex at max capacity when hurling, It looked so strenuous and painful. I couldn’t stand it for more than a few minutes. I asked a couple times if he needed to go to the hospital, always refused, per usual. 
	
	Next thing I knew he showered, and went to sleep. I wish I could say that’s a good thing, but that’s all I’ve actually seen him do. That and our brief conversations that end in him asking to go to the hot springs again. He goes to work, I’m assuming he must eat lunch at least. He does hum, a lot. More than before, and music that I didn’t know he really enjoyed. Songs that we never listen to, anyway. 
	
	 This was supposed to be the end of a desperate attempt to get this all down as vividly as possible, but it’s taken me two days to write this in my free time. In those two days, the only new or interesting development was last night. I decided to go online and see if I can find anything  on recent car accidents near Black Sulphur springs. I didn’t find any, but I did see a few deaths throughout the years, “accidental deaths” but I read a few obituaries. 
      
       I noticed a considerable amount of them were single people. 20’s and 30’s, and single parents with children missing in the same county as well. 
	
      What I already knew to be true was the massive forest fire that engulfed the hot springs and surrounding areas in the past. The land, except near the water, was still barely recovering after over 70 years. Which I still find odd, considering a forest that I grew up near burned 20 years ago when I was a child. It’s not very far north of there, and its recovery is astonishing. 
	
	I don’t know what to make of any of this, except a sense of urgency to get it out of my head, and maybe some validation that I am crazy. Maybe something, said by anybody, can convince me not to go back to Black Sulphur Springs. I need a real reason, and he thinks we are leaving after work tomorrow.

One of the biggest surprises was the importance of over-communication. We initially relied on fairly passive methods like email and occasional project management updates, but that quickly led to misunderstandings and duplicated efforts.switching to daily stand-up meetings (even short ones) via video conferencing and implementing a dedicated Slack channel for speedy questions made a huge difference in keeping everyone aligned.

Another crucial element was proactively building team rapport. In an office environment, you naturally build relationships through casual interactions. Remotely,that requires more intentional effort. We started doing virtual coffee breaks and team-building games once a month,and while it felt a little forced at first,it really helped foster a sense of connection and trust.

setting clear expectations and boundaries around work hours has been vital. It's easy for the lines to blur when your office is also your home.Encouraging team members to disconnect and recharge,and respecting their downtime,has significantly improved morale and reduced burnout.

1mnkv6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1mnkv6y/could_the_chulux_kompatto_espresso_machine/,Could the CHULUX Kompatto Espresso Machine Elevate Your Coffee Routine?,"The CHULUX Kompatto JH-C5010 has been my go-to espresso maker for the past month, and it has certainly spiced up my mornings. As someone who thrives on a good cup of coffee, testing this sleek and compact espresso machine felt nothing short of a treat. This 20-bar machine, equipped with a milk frother and promising advanced features like a PID temperature control system, was something I eagerly wanted to take for a spin. Yet, while it shines in certain aspects, it does leave room for improvement in others. Let me share my experience.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my attention was the machine's modern stainless-steel finish. It's narrow, only 5.6 inches wide, which is perfect for my small kitchen counter without making it feel cluttered. I appreciated the overall compactness and portability of this machine, which makes it ideal for an apartment or even a dorm room. Cleaning is also a breeze, thanks to the removable drip tray and water tank. However, the machine's lightweight design means it feels less stable during operation, especially when using the portafilter. While aesthetically pleasing and practical, I did notice some fingerprints on its metallic surface, which required regular wiping to maintain its polished look.

**Performance and Features**  
CHULUX's claim of a 20-bar pressure pump isn't just a marketing gimmick; it truly delivers rich and indulgent espresso cups. I experimented with both single and double espresso extractions, and the coffee came out smooth, aromatic, and well-balanced. The flavor profile was vibrant, with a lower acidity level, making every sip enjoyable. The pre-soak and low-pressure moistening function evenly wet the coffee grounds, ensuring a consistent brew. Its 1350-watt instant heating system also impressed me, whipping up my coffee in under a minute without compromising quality. However, the brewing temperature felt slightly inconsistent at times when I used larger volumes, causing a minor drop in the coffee's warmth. 

**Pluses**  
- Produces rich, balanced espresso with impressive pressure.  
- Compact design fits into small spaces easily.  
- Steam wand creates creamy microfoam for lattes and cappuccinos.  

**Milk Frother Experience**  
The milk frother is one of the standout features here. I made lattes, cappuccinos, and even hot chocolate to test its versatility. It creates a creamy microfoam that elevates the texture of drinks, and the hot water option was convenient for making Americanos. However, I noticed that the steam function often led to the machine requiring some cooling downtime, as indicated by the flashing light on the buttons. While this isn't a dealbreaker, it can slow down your morning routine if you're trying to whip up multiple coffee-based beverages.

**Shortcomings**  
- Machine stability could be improved during operation.  
- Occasional inconsistent brewing temperature.  
- The milk frother requires cooling downtime before reuse.  

**Industry Competitors**  
In terms of competition, the Kompatto's closest rivals are probably the Breville Cafe Roma or the De'Longhi Dedica espresso makers. Both offer semi-automatic functionalities. While the Breville provides more robust construction and durability, its price is notably higher. On the other hand, the De'Longhi model features slightly more consistent heating but doesn’t match the compactness of the Kompatto. Where the CHULUX shines is in its affordability and ease of use, catering especially to beginners or those with small kitchens. If you’re looking for convenience without a major investment, it holds its ground well as a cost-effective alternative.

**Smart Spending**  
While I wouldn't call it a high-end espresso maker, the CHULUX Kompatto offers good value for the price point. The stainless-steel build, compact design, and essential features like a built-in PID temperature control system make it appealing for someone who enjoys homemade lattes and cappuccinos. However, it’s important to weigh that against the occasional cooling requirements and temperature variations. For light to moderate use, especially in a home setting, it justifies its price tag. A more dedicated barista might find the lack of stability during operation and limited durability a concern, but for daily coffee enthusiasts, it's worth considering.

Please let me know your recommendations for these activities in Bali (not interested in sightseeing) if you've been there already?

Also, if anyone is planning to be in Bali around the same time and is interested in the same stuff, would love to connect!",2,1754936498.0,SoloTravel_India,1,1.0,False
1mnktuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1mnktuu/what_is_this_plant_or_food_thing_called/,What is this plant or food thing called?,"Okay so there's this plant or fruit thing that popped up in a dream and I'm 97% sure it's real but don't know what it's called. If you've ever had those dumb little bubble toy kits as a kid that all have the straw tubes (like with the pipe and kazoo) there was this one that has the tube blow thingy and on its end there's this triangle with divots in all three corners so when you blow in the tube part the bubbles come out from those divots- that's what the divots look like in this plant or fruit.

I think it's most likely a plant, but this plant kinda looks like a coffee filter, brown or weird off brand orange-y red(?) and has those divots all over the inside of the coffee filter. Maybe it's dry? Oh a better visual is a beehive- but think coffee filter. Or a muffin- that type of shape and size. I have no idea how to describe this thing, the landscape where I live in has nothing like what I'm describing so it's completely foreign to me. Maybe it's in a pond or swamp setting. Or maybe it's like I described and it's a fruit that has red jelly-esque goo in the divots. Is that something else? Please help a very confused soul ",2,1754936464.0,NoStupidQuestions,6,1.0,False

1mnks6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1mnks6d/intergenerational_family_trip_six_senses_laamu/,"Intergenerational Family Trip- Six Senses Laamu, Maldives","**Where we went**: *Six Senses Laamu*

**When we went**: *7/4-7/11 2025*

**Who went**: *Parents (mid to late 70s), Sister, BIL, nephew (5), myself and hubby*

Overall, an amazing trip that immediately gets you into the vacation mindset the moment you get to Male. We were met at the airport by Six Senses representatives, our luggage was managed, and we were escorted to a bus to get to the seaplane charter area/Six Senses lounge. The seaplane is about an hour ride (it's LOUD so you may want to have headphones on you), and you're given a bottle of water and cool towel the second you get on. Afterwards you land on a floating dock, and from there a 2 min boat ride to the welcome area of the resort. The boat ride really helps set the scene for the experience- they pass out shoe bags and you're welcomed to remove your shoes as the entire resort is a barefoot experience. At the arrival jetty you're greeted by all the staff leads and introduced to your butler at which point your bags are whisked to your rooms while you go on a tour. They even had super cute sea turtle backpack for my nephew!

**Service**: 7/10

* Restaurants: Super fast service the second you were seated. In the breakfast area, if you typically  repeated the same thing they would recognize you and ask if you wanted the 'regular' which was lovely. Breakfast was open air and it often got uncomfortable as you would just sit and sweat (yeah yeah I'm in the Maldives I get it). There were no fans to help move air. I appreciated they had a ""family side"" where they would immediately sit anyone with young children so as not to disrupt people looking for more of a quiet/restful breakfast experience. We sat with the whole family on Day 1 and it was definitely a little more chaotic on that side. While we weren't addressed by name, they still recognized us and would let my husband and I know if my family had arrived yet, and gave us the option to either sit with them or sit elsewhere. A few of the staff also went out of their way to engage with my nephew. He loved drinking out of a coconut so whenever they saw him he'd have his ""special drink"" soon after.
* Butler/Host : Super responsive and primary communication was WhatsApp. He made all our dinner reservations and coordinated kids club for the nephew.
* Housekeeping: Excellent. We always returned to a clean room and when they saw we used the minibar, they would also regularly leave ice without being asked. They also noted what alcohol we had been drinking, so when they restocked it was not just put on the shelf but in the fridge to chill which was a nice touch.
* Bars (Chill Bar and Sip Sip): Slow and just..odd? We wanted to have a nightcap and my husband and I are gin fans and ordered 2 different ones, straight with a few ice cubes. On the menu, for reference, they have a couple different Gin and Tonics but (I thought) we were clear on just wanting it straight. So the bartender makes them in the huge G&T goblets, added garnishes, and then the few ice cubes we requested so it ended up being this huge goblet with a tiny bit at the bottom. We got it cleared up but I guess they are not used to people ordering drinks straight. Another time we were at Sip Sip my sister ordered a gimlet that took forever to make-made the drink, but then had to find a glass. Poured into a water glass, then realized it should be in a coupe glass, so had to go get a coupe glass and then pour into that. Then almost poured another drink into the now empty but gimlet-y water glass but caught himself--so, just kind of laughable how inefficient the set up/training seemed to be. Or maybe he was just stoned? Our subpar bar experiences basically offset the stellar restaurant experiences.

**Property**: *10-GORGEOUS*

* This was my husband and I's first time to the Maldives (rest of family has been before). Six Senses is on its own island so it's not shared with any other resorts and you have full run of the island.
* The restaurants and common areas on more clustered on the east side of the island, with Jetty A being the closest (see map). My sister and I both had Sunset Laamu Water Villas (see 33 on map), with the only difference is she had a pool as well. I was originally going to be in a regular water villa (not sunset) but I assume thanks to [u/alextravels](https://www.reddit.com/user/alextravels/) we were able to get an upgrade which we learned upon arrival
   * [https://cdn.bfldr.com/B60H3R33/at/hqwhtc9457gbsmkw9mjvj/Six\_Senses\_Laamu\_Resort\_Map.pdf](https://cdn.bfldr.com/B60H3R33/at/hqwhtc9457gbsmkw9mjvj/Six_Senses_Laamu_Resort_Map.pdf)
* We were given bikes to get around on (and cute initials on the back to keep track!), and it looked like they had a couple tricycle style options if you weren't comfortable with a bike. The jetties themselves are probably about a quarter of a mile long so the bikes really cut your travel time quite a bit. There are big pots of water to cool your feet at regular intervals because the jetties would get quite hot on bare feet. There were buggies but by and large bikes or walking are the primary transportation, so definitely a tougher experience if you are differently abled.
* There was a kids club and my nephew seemed to enjoy his experiences there!

**Rooms**: *9*

* We had a Sunset Water Villa towards the end of Jetty A. My sister had the very last one on Jetty A which had amazing views in multiple directions. The views were absolutely amazing and even snorkeling right off our back deck was like an episode of National Geographic. Because the water is deeper towards the end of the jetties, those rooms have schools of fish that typically hang out in the shade of the villa. For that reason, if you have littles you might prefer a villa closer to the beach where the water would be much shallower.
* Our room had the shower/tub outside which I loved, and the toilet in a separate room inside. Everything else on the property is open air, so your rooms are the only respite from the heat with AC. My sister did ask them to check AC several times as she felt her room never got quite as cold compared to ours.
* Parents were in an Ocean Beach Villa with Pool- they were in 97 which was right next to Sip Sip and the Den, so it's the closest of all the Beach villas. The room was a similar layout to our overwater villas but also had a secondary outdoor shower, presumably to rinse off sand. The nephew and I had a ton of fun finding and holding hermit crabs (and of course placing them back where we found them!)

**Food**: 8

* There are a handful of restaurants with Longitude doing a daily breakfast and rotating dinner. Zen had delicious Japanese food while Leaf was an adults only option (it also has a fun rope bridge to walk across to get to!) We really enjoyed the rotating dinners at Longitude as there would be a theme and tons of variety/stations, so generally something for everyone. After a week, we never felt bored with the food.
* Breakfast was an interesting mashup- there was a menu and special each day, but there were also live cooking stations (crepes, dosas) and a variety of continental options (breads/pastries, cut fruit, etc.). One touch I loved is just off the restaurant is the wine ""cellar"" which of course is very cold- so they would have a variety of cheese, sashimi/nigiri, and cured meats you could go grab. While they did have a variety of coffee drinks, my one annoyance was the drinks were never hot- even if I ordered it extra hot, they were quite tepid. They did do french press coffee and those came out much hotter so after 2 days of trial and error we stuck to ordering a press which did the trick.
* My dad is diabetic and we blanked on packing Splenda/sugar alts, and I typically use an alternative as well. Not a huge deal, but they only offered two options- white or brown sugar. If this is important to your diet you will want to ensure you have the alternative of your choice.
* FREE ICE CREAM. There are probably 40 different sorbets and ice creams. Some personal favorites were the mango, pistachio, and the Nut-ella. I'm pretty sure we stopped there daily. 

**Extras & activities**: *10*

* Water Sport shack is complimentary for non-motorized items, so we did take paddleboards out on a calmer day
* Tropicsurf will also size you for flippers and a snorkel, also complimentary, you just return before you leave
* We did an excellent surf lesson at the surf shack- our instructor was super kind, knowledgeable, and we spent a few hours first on the beach learning the basics, then actually in the water. As I mentioned earlier, our parents had the closest beach villa so they actually got to see us doing our lesson and even got a few photos since we were right in their 'backyard' lol
* Dolphin Sunset Cruise- my sister booked this for our first day and what an amazing experience! There were a handful of other couples/families and they served a few snacks and prosecco. We saw several pods of spinner dolphins right from the beginning, even some swimming right along our boat!
* There will be a little brochure each week with all the activities, a mix of complimentary and not. My mom enjoyed sunrise yoga and a few exercise classes, so it's worth looking over to see if there is anything that catches your eye.

**Spa:** *10*

* The main spa building is basically the lobby and changing rooms, then there are 9 standalone treatment ""nests"" they will walk you to. Afterward, there is a relaxation area/juice bar where you are provided some mixed nuts and tea, with option to order off a menu as well. It overlooked the beach and was a nice area to lounge in-I wish I'd thought to bring my kindle and probably would have stayed there longer if I had something to do.
* There is a sauna that is complimentary to use even without a treatment planned, but it was basically a small closet style one in each changing room- so not a co-ed option where my husband and I could have hung out.
* Because it was our anniversary we received a complimentary massage (we could have also chosen a sunset dolphin cruise). We were in a hut just off the beach and I thought the massage was stellar with great pressure/adjusted based on my feedback. An interesting thing about our massage- we were given disposable underwear and a robe to change into. Just so you're aware, when they get to your back they do it ALL. I am used to typically getting the sheet tucked into the top of my undies, and if they do any glute work it's typically over the sheets. Here, she still tucked the sheet but pulled it waaay down and they do get hands on with your glutes. Again, nothing inappropriate at all, but for me it was a surprise. Maybe those of you with broader massage experience will tell me this is the norm at some resorts?
* There are bowls with raked sand and small coconuts arranged to mimic the six senses logo that are placed just under the headrest so you see them when you are in the facedown portion of the massage. Such a tiny touch but it was one of those things that made me go, ""Wow, they really have thought of everything here!""
* The spa also offers a variety of treatments for biohacking, sleep, etc. They seem to specialize in ayurvedic treatments as well. My dad made friends with the head of the spa and got a few treatments for his COPD cough and we all noted a marked improvement.

**Other**:

* Vibes- Upscale, family friendly. Even later in the evening the bar was relatively empty so not a party scene either.
* The team who greeted us took our passports at Male and returned them once we got to the sky plane terminal, but it made me a little squirrely to not have my passport on me for an extended period of time.
* Upon leaving, we were also met by a Six Senses representative who guided us through all the lines, carried our bags, etc. I think we would have managed just fine, but it was nice to just follow someone who knew where they were going and stay in that casual vacay mindset a teeny bit longer.

Would we go back?  ABSOLUTELY! But, we also haven't been to anywhere else in the Maldives so I would be intrigued to try other places to benchmark, but Six Senses definitely set a very high bar!",5,1754936361.0,chubbytravel,0,0.78,False

## Key Features analysis

The market offers a wide array of motorbike cup holders,each boasting different features. Understanding these features is crucial in making the right buying decision.

**Universal Mounting System:**

The core of a versatile motorbike cup holder lies in its mounting system. The best cup holders feature adjustable clamps and brackets that can accommodate a variety of handlebar sizes and configurations. Look for systems that utilize rubber padding or shims to ensure a secure and vibration-free fit without scratching or damaging your bike's finish. A well-designed universal mounting system offers secure attachement even on rough terrains.

**Adjustable Cup diameter:**

Different beverages come in different sized containers. A high-quality cup holder should feature an adjustable diameter to accommodate everything from small water bottles to larger travel mugs. This adjustability might come in the form of a spring-loaded mechanism,a tightening knob,or interchangeable inserts. Ideally, the adjustment should be easy to operate even with gloved hands, so you can swiftly adjust the grip based on your current drink.

**Secure Cup Retention System:**

Perhaps the most important feature is the mechanism that keeps your drink from spilling, especially on bumpy roads or during sudden maneuvers. This can involve a deep cup design, flexible inner flaps, or a combination of both. Some advanced models incorporate a locking system that secures the cup in place, providing extra peace of mind. The retention system should be robust enough to withstand the vibrations and forces encountered during a typical motorbike ride.

**Durable Construction Materials:**

Motorbike cup holders are exposed to the elements, including sun, rain, and temperature fluctuations. Thus, the choice of construction materials is critical for longevity. Premium cup holders are typically made from durable materials like aluminum, reinforced plastic, or stainless steel. these materials are resistant to corrosion, UV damage, and impact, ensuring that the cup holder can withstand the rigors of daily use.

**Anti-Vibration and noise Dampening:**

The vibrations from a motorbike engine can transfer to the cup holder, leading to irritating noise and potential spills. Look for models that incorporate anti-vibration features, such as rubber dampeners or foam inserts. These components help absorb vibrations and reduce noise, creating a more cozy and enjoyable riding experience. Reducing vibration extends the life of the cup holder.

**360-Degree Rotation:**

the ability to rotate the cup holder 360 degrees allows for optimal cup placement,regardless of the handlebar configuration or rider preference. This flexibility ensures that the cup holder is always within easy reach and does not interfere with othre controls or instruments. Being able to finely adjust the angle of the cup holder ensures the drink stays at the best angle.

Key features of the best motorbike cup holders include:

*   Universal mounting system
*   Adjustable cup diameter
*   secure cup retention system
*   Durable materials
*   Anti-vibration dampening
*   360-degree rotation functionality

## Core Benefits

Owning a motorbike cup holder extends beyond mere convenience; it enhances safety, comfort, and overall riding enjoyment.

**Improved Safety and Reduced distraction:** Having your drink readily available means you don't need to fumble around in your backpack or stop frequently to stay hydrated. This keeps your hands on the handlebars and your eyes on the road, considerably reducing the risk of accidents. Staying focused on riding is the greatest safety feature to have.

**Enhanced Hydration On the Go:** Long rides can be physically demanding, and staying hydrated is essential for maintaining energy and focus. A cup holder lets you easily carry water, sports drinks, or other beverages, ensuring you can rehydrate whenever needed without interrupting your journey. This is especially crucial during long rides in hot weather.

**Increased Convenience and Comfort:** Access to your favorite beverage on long rides can greatly improve your comfort level. Imagine enjoying a refreshing drink on a scenic road trip, without having to constantly pull over.The comfort and enjoyment derived from a simple drink can dramatically improve your experience.

**Versatility for Various Container Types:** A good cup holder isn't limited to just one type of container. It can accommodate water bottles, coffee cups, travel mugs, and even smaller containers of snacks or other essentials. This versatility makes it a valuable accessory for all types of riders and riding situations.

**Elimination of Spills and Mess:** A secure cup retention system prevents spills and messes, protecting your bike's finish and your riding gear.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions helps riders make informed decisions.

**Will this cup holder fit my specific motorbike model?**

Most universal cup holders are designed to fit a wide range of motorbike models with standard handlebars.Though, it's essential to check the mounting system's specifications and ensure it's compatible with your handlebar diameter. Refer to the product description or contact the manufacturer for specific compatibility information.

**How easy is it to install and remove the cup holder?**

Installation is typically straightforward, requiring only basic tools like screwdrivers or wrenches.Most cup holders come with clear instructions, and the process usually takes less than 15 minutes.

Cup holders made from high-quality materials like aluminum or reinforced plastic are generally durable enough to withstand moderate off-road riding.However, it's crucial to choose a model with a secure mounting system and a robust cup retention mechanism to prevent spills and damage on rough terrain. For intense off-road riding, consider specialized cup holders designed for demanding conditions.

**Can I adjust the cup holder while riding?**

### Key Differences Summary

The Motorbike Mug Master 3000 excels in versatility with its universal handlebar clamp and spring-loaded adjustment, making it suitable for a wide range of bikes and container sizes.

1mnknob,https://i.redd.it/99e0y0szlfif1.jpeg,What a dumbass. She’s going to wait an hour in line for a lalaland coffee. I live in LA and we have had lalaland forever. Yes the vibe is so cool and coffee is good but I wouldn’t wait an hour in line for it nor do I have time for it. So damn dumb. And she thinks she’s on to something new? No girl.,"This poor mother of four has to wait in line for a lalaland coffee. What a dumbass, tone deaf moron. I would never wait in line that long. And she’s probably exaggerating. Clearly it’s new to her area. But why in the world would you wait in an hour long line for coffee period. It’s not a magic potion. She’s so insufferable.
