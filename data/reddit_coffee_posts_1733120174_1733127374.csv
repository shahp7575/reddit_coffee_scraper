 So I was on Tinder two years ago and I knew there were a lot of fake profiles and stuff on there but I saw this girl and she was hot but not fake hot, like she had natural skin color and a beautiful smile so I hit her up right away. I was expecting a sad story or some other request for money but that didn't happen and we seemed to have a genuine conversation. We talked about politics and law which are my favorite subjects.  I was still cautious so we did video calls and we even met once for coffee but we were both busy so we only had about 10 minutes to actually talk. After the coffee I was smitten with her so I decided to go all out with this chick. 

The following Saturday I took her to Giovannis, Art in Island, and a movie. Now remember at this time I was still kinda broke so that was a big deal for me. However, it was a great evening and everything was going well. I did all my cheesy moves like pretending to bribe the hostess with a 20 peso bill to be seated quicker at the restaurant. In the grab car, I was tickling her and she was saying 'stoopp it hahaha' so all signs were a go. As we get closer to my place I decided to make my move and do a wet check.  That's when I discovered there was a pole instead of a hole.

What's worse is it was big too! So I felt betrayed and inadequate at the same time! I was pissed and I wanted to punch him/her in the face but she said 'oh I thought you knew' and I saw that he/she was shaking so I felt sorry for 'her' and gave 'her' 500 pesos to get a cab ride home. 

I thought I knew the signs of a ladyboy like their knockers are too firm and perky, their hands, etc but this one checked all the boxes. The only giveaway was 'she' had a funny jawline, like too manly. So far the jawline test hasn't failed me although I'm not in the market anymore.  So to newbies make sure you look at that jawline when they turn their head. If it's way too pronounced you'll know there's man plumbing under that dress.

I understand no one here is my realtor and would just appreciate anyone‚Äôs advice if they feel like giving it üòä

I am 28f and my husband is 30m (no children except cats and dogs) looking for a very walkable affordable urbanist small city.  

A few things that are very important musts:

-good job market (I am currently in property management but a variety of experience in multiple industries)
And my husband is in grocery retail management but is also flexible

-places to rent under $1500 in the walkable parts

The overall vibe I‚Äôm looking for is a hippie college town with a lot to do

We love going to the very chill but still very packed on weekend lowkey bars and breweries right walking distance from or in downtown

Great local places to eat and have coffee that aren‚Äôt chain restaurants 

Frequent festivals including jazz fest, wine walks, foodie fest, art vendor pop ups, farmers markets, wine tastings, and food trucks

We also like to go to DnD clubs, drag shows, small concerts, plays and other general theater or ballet.

I really am not a big fan of big cities with lots of tall buildings that look like dystopian concrete jungles, or sprawl everywhere with huge highways and football stadium sized parking lots.

With all that being said, do you feel like Eugene is the right place for us?

And if so.. what neighborhoods can I find that are in my budget rent-wise that I could walk to a majority of the things I enjoy doing?

1h4pxa0,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1h4pxa0/cant_figure_out_if_its_all_in_my_head/,Can't figure out if it's all in my head ,"First for a bit of background, I am a woman of foreign origin in a small and historically homogeneous European country. Most immigrants here are employed in minimum wage service jobs, me included for the first several years I lived here, which is why I felt so lucky when I managed to get a break into a well paying office job in an area relevant to my degree. I was actually only able to get the job through a connection, a friend of mine who I'll call L was working there and was able to put in a good word for me, which helped me get the job despite my lack of office experience.

When I first started the job, I was a minority being one of the few women of foreign origin in the office, and also quite a bit younger than most of my co-workers. I got along well enough with my co-workers despite the age difference and being one of the few women of foreign origin, the relationships weren't as warm and friendly as they were in my previous jobs, but I was okay with that. I was still friends with L, and had lunch with her at work most days since she usually felt left out and ostracized in her own department due to being the only woman of foreign origin in that department.

However, things got kind of, weird, with L after a while. She started to come across as kind of snippy and aggressive when I'd reach out to her about lunch. Things like, I'd be coming into work late and ask if she wanted to join me for lunch when I got to work, and she'd reply back ""No I cannot wait for you I am too hungry and have to go right now"" so I would just say okay, get to work, and she'd still go to lunch after I'd arrive, walk right past me without saying anything to me and sit at a different table. Or we would be eating together, and when she'd get up to leave before I was finished she'd say to me rather abrasively while throwing her hand in my face ""sorry I am too busy to wait for you to finish, this is just how it is!"", or when I'd message her on teams asking if she wanted to grab lunch she would give similar answers that struck me as abrasive.

I know that seems defensive like she expected me to protest her leaving early or not wanting to have lunch with me, but the thing is I never protested if she left early anything like that, to be honest I didn't really care that much since we're all busy at work and I understood that, I also would have understood if she just said ""sorry I'd rather have lunch alone today / have lunch with a different colleague"" instead of her giving bizarre responses like saying she couldn't wait for me then still going after me without saying anything. I also noticed she never messaged me asking me to go to lunch, it was only ever me asking her. Since she seemed irritated with me, I figured it would be best to give her space, and after a while if she still wanted to spend time with me then I figured she would reach out to me.

Then, around the beginning of this year, there was a massive turnover at my job. A lot of my co-workers, the ones older than me and from this country born and raised, all quit or were laid off all around the same time. In their place a bunch of young women of foreign origin were hired, and at first I was so thrilled! (I know, bit of a red flag, but I was still looking forward to working with people from the same demographic as myself) I thought it would be like my previous jobs where I could have a warm and friendly relationship with my co-workers.

I did feel like ‚Äúwork friends‚Äù with some of my new co-workers at first, or at least one of them I'll call E. E and I really hit it off right away. I hadn't felt like I had a work friend like that in a long time. She seemed super sweet and professional and fun at first. We even started getting drinks together outside of work and regularly talking outside of work.

However, we were assigned to work on the same projects, and after a while of working with her, I started to get a bad feeling about her. It would be things like, I would be doing my job as I was trained to do by sending information to suppliers that my boss and my supervisor and my mentor all told me I needed to be sending to the suppliers, and E would lecture me in a holier than thou tone that ""That was awfully nice of me to do"" but that I didn't need to be such a pushover to the suppliers. She also told me I was a pushover who couldn't stand up for myself because I accepted a project at work that my boss even told me would make the difference in whether or not she would be willing to hire me long term after my trial period, so it was either take the project or go back to minimum wage service jobs.

Or when a client was calling me and emailing me dozens of times a day accusing me of making mistakes that I hadn't made (everything in my documents were correct but he was misreading it) and I would turn to E to vent about this (because she vented and complained to me about clients all the time so I thought I could trust her with this) and she lectured me in the same holier than thou tone that I must have done something to ""escalate the situation"" with unprofessional behavior to make him behave that way. Then when she had similar issues with the same client and was at her computer talking about how she wasn't going to ""take that"" from him and wasn't going to be nice or professional to him, I was like ""what about what you were saying to me about not escalating the situation with unprofessional behavior"" she just giggled and smiled at me in a weird way.

It went on like this for a while. After a while I realized I couldn't carry on a conversation with her for more than a few sentences without her criticizing me in some way. One of the most recent examples is that a different co-worker complimented that my desk mat, water bottle, and coffee thermos all match each other, and E made a comment about how she doesn't clutter her desk like that because it would be inconsiderate to anyone else who might need to use her desk. I just said that other people have used my desk when I'm not at the office without any issues, and she just said to me in a tone that came across as patronizing and condescending ""that's good! that's very good! I'm very glad to hear that!"" and then walked away.

Another co-worker who I will call U started around the same time as E. E and U also quickly hit it off with each other. Since I initially got along really well with E, and all three of us were women of foreign origin around the same age I tried really hard to get along with U when she first started. But after a while I noticed that almost every time I spoke around U she always reacted like what I was saying was the most stupid and offensive thing she'd ever heard. She always sneered and made faces like she was appalled by what I was saying, even if it was just like ""I don't personally care for this voice actor's version of this audiobook"". Didn't matter, she'd sneer with her upper lip curled up like I was disgusting and act like it was horribly offensive of me to say and made me disgusting to say.¬†

Meanwhile, U was chummy and super affectionate to everyone else in our department except for me. She'd even run up to and hug other people in our department, go over to everyone else‚Äôs desk except mine, while continuing to sneer at me like I was disgusting every time I opened my mouth or did anything.

Here's where L comes back in, because L also quickly hit it off with E and U. L started always coming over to E and U's desks to socialize and loudly gush over how much she loves them and how great of co-workers they are. The three of them started having lunch together every day. I felt upset that L was the way I described above and was suddenly all lovey and gushy with E and U, so I texted L to ask if at any point I had done anything to upset her or offend her. She replied to me ""No, you haven't done anything to upset me or offend me, but you're the one that used to ask me to lunch and now you don't ever message me asking me to go to lunch with you, so I think you're the one that's changed and you're the one that has a problem."" I explained to her that her behavior led me to believe that she was annoyed with me, and also she never asked me to lunch and it was always me asking her, and she never responded to me. The next day at work I swear I saw her scowling at me from across the office.

So now, L, E, and U continue to act like best friends at work. The three of them are also quite popular with just about everyone except me. They often hug the other women at the office, loudly socialize, talk about staying over at each other's apartment's and babysitting U's kid and all getting margaritas together after work (none of them knew each other until E and U started at the office at the beginning of the year) while treating me the same way as described above (U sneering at everything I say and do like I disgust her, E criticizing everything I say and do, and L just scowling at me and acting annoyed at me for just existing).

I avoid going to any and all work social events now. I started having to work from home more because of how depressed and ostracized I feel at work. L, E, and U continue to be very popular and beloved by just about everyone at work, and I feel like other people's behavior towards me has started to change. Other co-workers who I used to at least somewhat get along with now treat me like I am annoying and stupid and regularly talk over me and dismiss me. It's been really digging at my self esteem and making me feel weak and powerless and stupid.

I also can't stop thinking about if this is my fault. After a few months of leaving work feeling so depressed and ostracized, and sometimes crying, I started to be more closed off at work, I keep my noise canceling headphones on all the time and just ignore L, E, and U as much as I can, and I feel like this has just escalated their behavior towards me. Especially L started acting even more aggressive and abrasive towards me after I started shutting people out more. With U even when I keep my noise cancelling headphones on all the time she still finds reasons to berate me and sneer at me. If I keep my noise cancelling headphones off for more than a few minutes E will find something to criticize me for.¬†

Maybe I am overreacting and causing all the problems by ignoring them at work instead of trying harder to be friendly to them. Maybe I imagined the hostility in the beginning and it became a self fulfilling prophecy when I started ignoring them and shutting them out.¬†

I am trying hard to get a new job since I am so miserable at this one and feel so ostracized at this one. But as a woman of foreign origin, it's so hard to get a good job when my name doesn't look like the name of someone born here and I speak the local language imperfectly and with a strong accent. I'm starting to feel hopeless about finding a new job that isn't a minimum wage service job again.

If you made it this far, thank you for making it through this novel of a post. I did not expect it to be this long. Maybe I just want to feel heard, I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to about this. If anyone has any advice on how to alleviate the situation, and not be miserable, that would also be appreciated.",1,1733125802.0,workplace_bullying,1,1.0,False

I (27F) have started a relationship with my boyfriend (27M) 1.5 year ago. We first started as friends with benefits but we very quickly fell in love.

By now, we have a normal relationship, going on vacations, planning future, spending all time possible together. I feel like I found my soulmate because we communicate like best friends, laugh all the time and the bed time is absolutely perfect.

The only issue is, before me he had a 3 years long relationship with basically his high school crush and I feel like he finds it hard to cut the contact.

In the time we were just FWB, he was talking to her actively (but only drunk, which I know because he also texted me and I knew he was going on drinks with friends), usually about life updates, but one time he told her ""one day when I'm worth it and you're still interested, I'm going to marry you"". We talked about why he said it and he said he doesn't know but after a long discussion he said maybe it is because he felt pity as she was still single after 6 months post breakup with him. He said he loves me and can't imagine ever going back to her because he found in me everything he ever wanted in life.

We worked through it and I am very okay with him having good relationship with ex partners, but I asked him to tell me if she ever contacted him, because I rather know the situation instead of finding out randomly and loosing the trust.

But few days before, we were watching movie and he opened his texting app accidentally and I saw a message to her from 1 month before saying ""I will call you in a moment"". I asked him what is this about and why he didn't tell me and the outcome is, again, his ex sent him a weird message from some relative, also mentioning him so he wanted to discuss this with her. It's not important what the communication was about, but I was very touched that he didn't tell me and we had a long discussion about this where he apologized a lot and agreed with me that he should have told me but he just didn't want to make a deal about it.

From my POV, this message was definitely just attention seeking and this is something she does all the time. Every time she's in a town she calls him if he wants to meet on a coffee or when she has some news, she always sends a text about it. Normally, I wouldn't care, but he hurt me multiple times because of her and the relationship was toxic as hell. I do not understand why he doesn't cut the contact or at least set some boundaries as he is now in another relationship.

How do I approach this? I am scared that this will slowly break my trust towards him and it cannot be recovered ... There is more to the story, as he hurt me because of her multiple times (usually because he met her or called her without me knowing or he stayed with her for hours talking and ignored me for hours - although nothing happend, which I trust him about) but this is the most important part.

TLDR: My BF is still in contact with his ex although hurting me multiple times because of her.",1,1733125387.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

But few days before, we were watching movie and he opened his texting app accidentally and I saw a message to her from 1 month before saying ""I will call you in a moment"". I asked him what is this about and why he didn't tell me and the outcome is, again, his ex sent him a weird message from some relative, also mentioning him so he wanted to discuss this with her. It's not important what the communication was about, but I was very touched that he didn't tell me and we had a long discussion about this where he apologized a lot and agreed with me that he should have told me but he just didn't want to make a deal about it.

From my POV, this message was definitely just attention seeking and this is something she does all the time. Every time she's in a town she calls him if he wants to meet on a coffee or when she has some news, she always sends a text about it. Normally, I wouldn't care, but he hurt me multiple times because of her and the relationship was toxic as hell. I do not understand why he doesn't cut the contact or at least set some boundaries as he is now in another relationship.

How do I approach this? I am scared that this will slowly break my trust towards him and it cannot be recovered ... There is more to the story, as he hurt me because of her multiple times (usually because he met her or called her without me knowing or he stayed with her for hours talking and ignored me for hours - although nothing happend, which I trust him about) but this is the most important part.

TLDR: My BF is still in contact with his ex although hurting me multiple times because of her.",2,1733125319.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

Hey everyone, I just got a new Lelit Anita PID and am really excited about making quality coffee at home. Definitely struggling to dial it in from the start but I think I‚Äôve at least made some progress. My two questions thus far are as follows:

How low should temperature drop during extraction? I always wait for the machine to heat up to 95 in order to make sure I start at the right temperature but during extraction it seems to drop down to low 80‚Äôs. Is something wrong with my machine? Am I doing something to cause the issue? Is that normal?

How long should it take to pull a double shot? I measure out 17g of beans and grind. I also give the machine a bit of a pat to help with retention and measure afterwards to make sure I haven‚Äôt lost too much. When I am ready to pull a shot a solid amount starts to come out as soon as it reaches the appropriate pressure but then it slows again and is really a dribble. Is this normal? Is this related to temperature issue above?

I probably sound like such a newbie but there are so many things this could be a bit of guidance would be helpful. Also happy to give more info if it helps.

Anyway I have a 2 year old who has a pretty bad cold and kept waking up in the night continuously and only got about 2-3 hours sleep and im at the depot for 6am the following morning thanks to the  chritmas peak and insane overloads I'm getting nearly over 200 stops a day and not completing my route till about 2-3pm plus the extra time driving to debrief and returning any packages I was unable to deliver then drive back home. On the way to the depot which is over a 1 hour drive from my house I started to feel nauseous and dizzy from the lack of sleep and had to pull over and phone my Respective manager explaining my daughter not sleeping due to be being unwell and the lack of sleep because of it and requested the day off for my safety or at least have the shortest route as possible. He immediately said no to both and demanded Me to come in or loose my job so I had to my route and luckily nothing happened but it was a slow and painful day with insane amount of monster just to keep me going. I understand this was last minute and it's Christmas peak but when your falling asleep behind the wheel even after 3 cups of coffee and the air conditioning on you know your not fit to able to work today but still getting told to come in that can't be legal. I'm sorry for the rant and if this doesn't really make sense but I'm fucking furious that they are completely disregarding my situation and throwing my safety out the window and play the ""you'll be fired card"" without considering the high possibility of a traffic accident waiting to happen or even worse fatality.",1,1733125207.0,AmazonDSPDrivers,1,1.0,False

I(19M) live with my brother(16M) sister(14F) and mom (51F).  It isn't entirely relevant but my sister has mild-moderste developmental delay, so she has roughly the mental age of an 8 year old.

I have has sensory issues my whole life, most of which I've manged to over come but something with certain foods I just can't get over.  I hate my siblings I would stop them from being bullied but like I still hate them.  My life would be so much better without them.  I am sorta like a personal maid.  While working a full-time job and a part time job I am expected to do everyone's laundry make 1-2 meals a week, help them with their homework and take care of our 2 family dogs.  I also pick up after them both and I think this is where the issue starts.  They are very messy eaters.  Like need to change the table cloth every other meal messy, maybe once a month we need to change th table cloth mid meal.  I address this issue to my mom(and dad(54M) when he lived with us) but they didn't see an issue with this.  So when I would clean up after them everything would be sticky.  Ice cream containers, cups, chairs, chip bags that they got from the school Cafe and didn't eat and didn't know what to do with them so thy leave them on the dining room table.  And because my hatrid for these prices of shit is so strong I don't eat a lot of things I know I like sully because they like them.  This includes butbis not limited to: pizza, cookies and creme anything, chettos, doritos, granola bars, milk, coffee, orange juice, and oatmeal.  This is such a big issue that the package of the food affects me.  You know those small bags of lays you get from thr school cafeteria or from a subway, I won't eat chips from those.

Is it normal ?,"I (27F) have started a relationship with my boyfriend (27M) 1.5 year ago. We first started as friends with benefits but we very quickly fell in love.

By now, we have a normal relationship, going on vacations, planning future, spending all time possible together. I feel like I found my soulmate because we communicate like best friends, laugh all the time and the bed time is absolutely perfect.

The only issue is, before me he had a 3 years long relationship with basically his high school crush and I feel like he finds it hard to cut the contact.

In the time we were just FWB, he was talking to her actively (but only drunk, which I know because he also texted me and I knew he was going on drinks with friends), usually about life updates, but one time he told her ""one day when I'm worth it and you're still interested, I'm going to marry you"". We talked about why he said it and he said he doesn't know but after a long discussion he said maybe it is because he felt pity as she was still single after 6 months post breakup with him. He said he loves me and can't imagine ever going back to her because he found in me everything he ever wanted in life.

We worked through it, he stopped talking to her and I am very okay with him having good relationship with ex partners, but I asked him to tell me if she ever contacted him, because I rather know the situation instead of finding out randomly and loosing the trust.

**25th - 26th Hakone**

Just thought I'd share my experiences no matter how repetitive/basic just in case it comes in handy for anyone. I travelled with my husband and caught up with 3 other friends while in Kyoto. Please feel free to ask any questions and if you have any feedback for anything we missed/shouldn't have done then please let me know because we're planning a second trip!

See previous post for Osaka

**Hotel:** 

* Hotel Forza Kyoto Shijo Kawaramachi - Very comfy stay. Great amenities including a free sake every evening. 
* The Machiya Kamiumeya - A traditional aesthetic hotel closer to Gion with tatami and futons
* Suiun - Ryokan in Hakone 

**Weather:** It unexpectedly snowed while we were here! If it wasn't for illness getting in the way of our plans we definitely would have gone straight to the Golden Pavillion for a beautiful view of it capped with snow. 

Something we missed on purpose: **Arashiyama** \- from reading posts on this sub it felt like it took up a large proportion of the day, felt rushed and just wall to wall with tourists doing it for the sake of hitting all the must do spots. We also had plans to go see the snow monkeys in Nagano. For this reason we decided to skip it and enjoy a slow paced few days here. But we didn't really experience large crowds while we were in Kyoto during our dates so I wonder if this was a mistake to miss out on. We are travelling back here in November next year and I'm in two minds on whether we make the point to go. 

**Day 1:** 

* Traveled from Osaka and dropped our bags at the hotel
* **Nishiki market** 12:00pm - a decent amount of people walking through but easy to walk without being squished. No crazy lines for food. 
   * Croquettes from Hanayori Kiyoe 10/10
   * Marion Crepes 10/10
   * Fish cakes from Houkyuuan 4/10 - probably really good and as you would expect but it was the first time we ever had non-Thai fish cakes and we didn't enjoy them
   * Yataai Mura STALL VILLAGE - got a 100 yen sake and regretted it, straight alcohol isn't for me. This place looked amazing and I wish we ate here but at the time we were full. There were stalls selling grilled seafood and tempura!
* Walked around the area finding small temples
* Checked into our hotel and headed back out to explore the shops around 4:30pm
* **Nintendo store:** got an obligatory photo in front of the giant mario head. There was an attendant there taking photos for people. **Notable purchases;** 
   * Blind bag collectable magnets featuring the old game covers
   * Yoshi egg bathbomb featuring a mystery coloured yoshi inside
* Disney store, Edion - admiring all the different tech
* **Pokemon store:** Exclusive Kyoto Pikachu plushie in a sweet little kimono!!
* **Tokyu hands:** Dragon ball uno - unique rules! Ono 99 - a fun game! (We had also purchased pokemon uno in Osaka which also had unique rules)
* Stumbled upon an underground cave styled restaurant that served unlimited lemon sour on tap. Yakitori was very nice but the drinks were a big mistake. We didn't realise how strong they were until it was too late. Lets just say til this day I still can't stomach Yakitori or lemon sours. 

  
**Day 2:** 

* We had already written this day off as a hangover day so we had low expectations
* Enjoyed McDonalds in bed for lunch and tackled the laundry
* Headed to **Shijo-dori** in **Gion** around 5pm - The stores closed at 7pm from memory. 
   * **Notable purchase:** Chopsticks engraved with our names in both English and Kanji. Probably one of the best souvenirs we bought. Also had fun picking out unique novelty chopstick rests.
* **Hanamikoji dori** \- Absolutely beautiful to walk through as the sun was setting, only a few other people there
* **Yasaka shrine:** 6pm - sun had completely set and the temple was lit up and absolutely stunning. There were a handful of couples walking around but I wouldn't say crowds so it was really peaceful. We walked around the grounds until we were starving. 
* **Dinner:** Gyukatsu Kyoto Katsugyu Gion Yasaka 6:30pm 12/10 - We randomly came across this place and it was the best 'stumble in' no plan dinner we had the entire trip. Tender beef katsu with a variety of dipping options including onsen egg which was my favourite. 

**Day 3:** 

* **Fushimi inari:** 7:30am - Only a handful of people on the way up. We weren't feeling too good so we were only there for half an hour and didn't walk up too far. 
* **Breakfast:** Walked around the area but nothing seemed open at the time (8:30am) Found Cafe goo. I can't even remember what I had so I wouldn't say it was very notable. But I do remember it was run by very lovely women and it was cosy. 
* We didn't expect to be back so early so we decided to walk around Gion without a map. 
   * Kennin-ji  - 9:30am - we were the only ones there. It was peaceful and beautiful. 
   * Yasaka Koshin-do 
   * Hokan-ji - 9:45am - maybe a handful of people but we were able to get some nice photos without anyone in the way. 
   * I think the stores along the Sannen-zaka path only opened at 10:00am so we were able to enjoy the walk without the crowds
   * Once they opened we got some more engraved chopsticks and a set of very decorative tea mugs
   * Snack: Croquettes from Kikakuan okamoto Sanneizaka 10/10!
   * Walked down Ninenzaka and spent another hour getting lost
* **Lunch:** My pet peeve on this trip was eating fast food and wasting opportunities to eat regional exclusive dishes! But travelling with a bunch of boys we ended up doing this quite a bit. KFC today and it wasn't even good. 
* Shopping
   * Daishodo Japanese Woodblock prints - found this store and loved looking at all the prints
   * Husband bought a few Dragon Ball figurines and they were the cheapest prices we found compared to Osaka and Tokyo
   * Onigiri - I can't find where it was but picked up some freshly made onigiri from a store and it was incredible!
   * Ochanokosaisai Nishiki - Got a sample of rice with their furikake - SOLD - bought two packets and regret not getting more. It is the most tasty furikake I have ever had. Exclusive to this store as far as I'm aware
* **Round 1:** a good place to have some fun while you wait to work up an appetite 
* **Dinner:** Kairikiya - Ramen 8/10 with a side of gyoza and fried rice 10/10. Cheap too! 
* **Dessert:** Strawberry sandwich with custard and cream from 7-eleven - 7/10 Super fun but I feel like i'd enjoy it more if the bread was sweet too

**Day 4: Nara day trip**

* **Breakfast:** Egg sandwich from 7-eleven 10/10 still dream about these
* Had a hard time making it to Nara this day getting lost in the train station and missing the direct train. Hopped on another train that terminated at a random station in the middle of nowhere and then had to buy a limited express ticket to finally make it to Nara
* Caught the mochi pounding demonstation - 11:00am - wasn't a huge line. The mochi was so fresh and warm but no one in our group enjoyed the flavour
* We were stopped by a group of lovely older ladies who wanted to practice their English with us. This happened quite often on our trip
* Got a sweet potato from a vendor around the park. It was nice and warm but not sweet and didn't have much flavour at all. Note: The signs are priced 200 yen per 100g (I think?) and we were lined up behind a man who argued with the lady for a long time thinking it was meant to be 200 only. 
* I'm not sure if this is all throughout the year or just because it was winter but a lot of the deer looked quite skinny and malnourished, lots had balding patches in their fur, broken antlers and cataracts or missing eyes. It was quite a shock and unsettled me. 
* Todai-ji - beautiful 
* We walked around the park for maybe 2 hours before heading back to Kyoto
* Lunch: Famichicki and some onigiri 10/10
* We stopped at Kyoto station and explored. Got a lovely view from the skyway including some incoming snow!!
* Snack: Mister Donut - kind of stale 4/10
* Dinner: Niigata Katsudon Tarekatsu - 8/10 pork cutlet set meal with very salty pickles
* Dessert: Naruto Taiyaki Honpo - 10/10 piping hot custard is always a great treat on a freezing cold night

  
**Day 5:** Hotel transfer day

* I went to get some 551 Horai takeaway from Daimaru and on my walk it started lightly snowing and did so for the rest of the day! This was an amazing surprise as we didn't expect to experience snow until our stay in Hakuba. 
* **Breakfast:** 551 Horai - 12/10 Pork buns and gyoza - this was my second time having them (went to Osaka first) I didn't have them enough, they were so juicy and the flavour is unlike anything I have had before. 
* We checked out of our hotel and used their luggage forwarding service to send our two suitcases to Tokyo as we were spending 1 night in Gion and the following night in Hakone. This was a simple process and the receptionist phoned the Tokyo hotel for us to confirm everything. I could be wrong but I think it was $24 (AUD).
* Bought a sturdy tote bag with a cute shiba wearing glasses from a vendor in Shinkyogoku.
* We had to go to a separate check in location for our next hotel which was located near Kyoto station. They gave us instructions on how to then locate and enter our accommodation. 
* **Lunch:** Katsudon from a restaurant in Kyoto station 12/10 delicious! I'm not sure what the correct name is because we had issues finding this in Japan. Back home Katsudon is rice with chicken katsu, sweet onions and an egg scrambled over top. In Japan we would search this term but only find pork katsu without egg/onion. Does anyone know the correct Japanese name for this dish?
* **Coffee:** SOT Coffee Roaster - 10/10 can't fault the Matcha latte or matcha cheesecake we had! We sat on tatami and relaxed. 
* The Machiya Kamiumeya - our accommodation for the night. Tatami matts and futon beds. 10/10 aesthetic and exactly what we were after. But in the middle of the night we could head the pitter patter of tiny feet in the roof (or at least I hope it was the roof). I have no idea what it was and if it was rats I'd prefer not to know
* We made our way to Kiyomizu-dera for the sunset which was obscured by clouds but nevertheless was beautiful. This time of year most trees had no foliage so I imagine this would be 1000x more beautiful during other seasons. There was plenty of people around but nothing like the crowds I have seen for other times of the year. 
* We managed to get the iconic Sannenzaka photo with the pagaoda at night with no one in frame. It was so peaceful walking through here with the glow of the lanterns. 
* **Dinner:** Negibouzu - family run okonomiyaki restaurant 8/10 - quite low in flavour, definitely needed lots of the sauce. Not as good as the place I tried in Osaka and Tokyo. But still enjoyed it. Sitting hot plate side at mum and pop restaurants was my favourite dining experience in Japan and I wish we did more of it. 
* Returning to our accommodation we noticed snow was starting to collect on the ground, cars and roofs. 

  
**Day 6:** Travel to Hakone 

* It was snowing a bit more heavily and there was a decent collection of snow on the ground
* 10:30am Shinkansen from Kyoto station to Odawara station and then a bus to Hakone
* **Breakfast:** realising this was my last opportunity to have it I hunted far and wide for 551 in the station but I couldn't figure out the location. Was super sad and settled for 7-eleven onigiri (not a bad consolation prize)
* There was heavy snowfall somewhere along the route so the train had to travel at a slower speed. The scenery was stunning though!
* We got off at the closest stop to our Ryokan but google maps had us walk up a really steep hillside that felt really off the beaten path so I panicked a bit. Also being unfit I struggled. 
* Checked into Suiun by 3:30pm. Was greeted with a tea and mochi. Room was beautiful and we had a private bath on the balcony. Free snacks and drinks available. Access to multiple other onsens on the property for private use. This is the reason we chose Suiun because we weren't confident using public onsen. 
* **Onsen:** very very hot! Took a while to mix the cold water through to make it comfortable. But oh so good for those achey feet. 
* **Kaiseki dinner:** I really wanted to experience this besides not being the most adventurous eater. I'd say I enjoyed half of the items and struggled with the rest. There was sashimi, fugu set in a clear jelly (tasteless), grilled fish (amazing), wagyu hot pot, shark fin in an eggy custard (so hard to stomach), tuna with a very overpowered sesame sauce, red bean drink and yuzu sorbet
* There was so much food at dinner and I forced myself to eat the lot. Unfortunately that made my insides burn and I felt quite sick the rest of the night. Unfortunately I couldn't use the onsen that night. 

**Day 7:** Hakone loop --> Travel to Tokyo

* The public onsens were closed for cleaning unfortunately so I just used the onsen in our room in the morning. I was a bit disappointed that we spent all that money and I felt like I didn't take enough advantage of the luxury stay - because food hurt me :(
* **Breakfast kaiseki:** I opted for the japanese breakfast while hubby wanted western after being too adventurous the night before. Grilled flattened fish was the star of the show! It's why I wanted to do a kaiseki so bad. If anyone knows how to get this outside of a ryokan please let me know!

I went ahead and got their full discovery set, with all three of their collections. I liked the color collection best, but the others were quite different from what I‚Äôve smelled before. Here are my impressions of all their current fragrances. 

Black C: 8.5/10. A gorgeous spicy amber. It‚Äôs bursting with pink pepper in the opening, then unfolds to reveal a subtle oud. There‚Äôs a hint of earthiness and caramel as well. It‚Äôs like a more sophisticated baccarat rouge 540. This might be my favorite from the house. 

Blue C: 6/10. I can‚Äôt decide if it smells more floral or more like play-dough. Or like blue candy. This one isn‚Äôt bad, but it‚Äôs not for me. 
    
Flash: 7.5/10. This one has a purple label (not to be confused with Love which is purple/green). Probably my favorite from the commodity line. I‚Äôm not really sure what I‚Äôm getting from it, but none of the listed notes stand out to me. It‚Äôs like a warm amber with a hint of something gourmand. 
    
For Sasha Frolova: 7.5/10. Is this oud and rose? I‚Äôm not sure, but I‚Äôm liking it. There‚Äôs something a bit fruity in here too.
    
Fuel: 4.5/10: The conspiracy line came without labels, but I think I figured out which is which based on the colors of the packaging and what it says on their website.   This one is green colored. There‚Äôs too much of a jackfruit smell for me with this one. I‚Äôll have to see if the dry down uncovers more oud. Update: sort of, but I still got jackfruit from it. 
    
Green C: 6.5/10. This one smells like Christmas. It must be the cardamom and ginger dominating, because other notes include marijuana, coffee, and mango. 
    
Human: 6.5/10. This one has a logo that is bronze colored. I didn‚Äôt think it was possible for a fragrance to be too spicy for me, but this one proved me wrong. The spice seems more synthetic though. It‚Äôs not bad, but it kind of reminds me of carrots somehow. 
    
Living Coral C: 5/10. Not too into this one. I think cotton candy is a killer for me. It‚Äôs just too synthetic and sweet. I wouldn‚Äôt wear it. 
    
Love: 7/10. This one has a purple/green logo on the cover. I didn‚Äôt expect to like something with popcorn as a top note as much as I do. There‚Äôs even the hint of salt. The caramel and musk balance it out. 
    
Purple C: 6/10. I‚Äôm not sure how to describe this one. It almost opens with a wet concrete vibe, but I can see how it‚Äôs reminiscent of snow or ice. The orris is a bit too strong for me though. I do get a tiny hint of leather, but not so much of the other notes. 
    
Red C: 7/10. The peony in here is lovely. The amber supports, and I don‚Äôt even mind the florals. I might wear this one in early spring. 
    
Wealth: 5/10. This one has a white/silver logo on the cover. I guess it sort of smells like cash? Mostly musk and orris though. It‚Äôs interesting, but not wearable. 
    
Yellow C: 7/10. Rum and cinnamon lead in the opening, while patchouli and oud take over the dry down. It is a very masculine scent, but I might still wear it.

about me:  
5'5  
56kg  
works weekdays, umaalis sa bahay ng 6am, nakakauwi ng 8pm

I've always been slim and ngayon lang nagkalaman laman kahit papano kase I've been working out na at home. Goal ko sana mag gain pa ng muscle mass.

So here's my routine:  
3-4 times a week I do 2-3 sets of incline pushups 20-30 reps,  
3-4 times a week 2 sets dumbbell curl 25 reps (wala ako dumbbells so I use my bakcpacks na may laman haha)  
2-3 times a week I do sit-ups 25 reps pagkagising  
For my cardio, I always take the 5-flight stairs sa may mrt pag papasok and nilalakad ko about 1.5km pag uuwi. I make sure na I total 6-7k steps per day, or at least sa weekdays.  
I recently started doing body weight squats din pala kase feeling ko kulang pa activity ng lower body ko. I do 2 sets 20 reps, 2-3 times a week.

For my diet naman, di ako super strict pa dito e pero here's the gist  
For breakfast, either sandwich or rice meal, sometimes cup noodles, but I always make sure na meron ako 1-2 eggs sa breakfast. I take my coffee without sugar but with cream. Pag mag 3-in-1 ako, yung with stevia ang tinitimpla ko  
For lunch: rice, meat/fish and vegies  
For dinner, di ko nacocontrol kase yung roommate ko nagdedecide ng lulutuin niya e haha kaya kung ano meron ayun na  
For snacks naman throughout the day, usually biscuits, nuts, or saging  
Di narin ako nagsosoftdrinks e. Water, coffee, tea nalang iniinom ko, all without sugar.

So it is safe ba for me to take creatine? If so, recommended dosage?

I'm sorry so I go home. They said I hope you feel better. I think nothing of it. I think that the next day I will be fine. Feel better I was scheduled for I unfortunately woke up very close to my scheduled times so maybe I did feel and look a little groggy.. but I quickly did my make up for a coffee and was ready to work. Turns out we wasted gas, makeup, and my time. they said ""my name, office now."" i have to send you home again... look at you. you look tired again. i said no i dont i look pretty i look fine, i can work i promise. she said no i cant have you do that. i said please can i work for an hour and show you i am capable? she said no you are a liability if you were to get hurt it would fall on us. then i start crying.. and wait on my ride. i leave... and then an hour and a half later i get a notification on hot schedules my schedule has been modified and they removed my two shifts which are my biggest money making days. a to go double, and a closing solo food runner. i freak out, call the store and ask for a manager. my to go coworker puts me on hold, then says they are very busy. so i say fuck this im coming in. well i come in and no one is busy they are literally all in a circle gossiping. not real busy huh... i say why was i taken off? i need the money.. she said why did you come back? then we talk and she explains im not regular (my name) that i need time to get myself together... the other manager who was the one working last night and sent me home was saying that we have to run a business and this is not how we run a business he said what did you do yesterday? you took your medication at the wrong time don't you have a time specific time that you have to take those and I agreed and said yes I took it during the daytime bc i missed my night dose, and the conversation was only about five minutes and I asked well you only took me off this week. Can I come back Thursday? They said no we can talk on Thursday and go from there. You need to get yourself together. There was some other things that were said, but I can't recall them right now so I'm just wondering what is going on in this situation. has this happened anywhere you've worked? there was also some drama that occured.  drama that happened was i was talking and flirting w one of the cooks who has been on n off with bartender for 2 years he told her even though i said not to n everyone made fun of me n he ended up ghosting me n i asked for a phone call and he said he was still in love w her. hes been rude since and idk if my managers have asked if they would like me gone. he never forgave for doing me like that either. its ok im over it & over him but i cried for days straight while working bc my coworkers have been straight up bullying and talking shit about me because of it and we are all grown adults. i really just wanna do my job... i wish he never told her and she went and told everyone about us talking esp because nothing came from it. if enough ppl would like to see me gone because of that im sure thats part of it. I've only been working here for 5 1/2 months, but it has become one of my favorite jobs and I'm really good at what I do, I don't know if I should call HR and see what we can do for me or just move on because this is fucked up and I don't deserve it. the manager who took me off schedule has saved my ass twice w write ups, My GM has wanted to fire me multiple times and she has saved me so I know she genuinely cares about me, but she says I'm not myself and that she loves me when I'm working and I'm doing good. I'm really upset because I have bills to pay. I'm losing at least $250 that i would've made for my two days. I'm gonna talk on Thursday but I'm trying to finish up this long post lol. can anyone give me advice, does anyone else relate or seen anything similar? I think I feel very mistreated and that this is discrimination. Thank you for reading, if you read this long.

With the sales going on right now, it might be a good time to go further down the rabbit hole, grinding fresh and trying my hand at puck prep.

Tempted to pickup a De'Longhi Dedica (EC680) and a Fellows Opus on the current BlackFriday/CyberMonday deals. Am I missing something important about this budget pairing? Less than perfect is fine. Optimal is hard to achieve on a budget. Just trying to achieve good/decent consistency with mid and dark roasts. Primarily, but not exclusively, decaf. Plan is to pre-measure out doses in tubes, and then single dose the grinder.

Seems that the Breville Bambino and Baratza ESP (or DF54) are more recommended by the r/espresso subreddit. But, the sales bring the Dedica and Opus combo to within budget stretching range. Especially when you also add-in extras for puck prep and counter organizing.

Other temptations, thoughts:

* Whatever I go with will see daily use. Will continue using Nespresso original style pods at work.
* Already have a *functional* Instant Pot milk frother, Wacaco Exagram scale and Bodum gooseneck kettle. Leaving the door open for manual options like the Wacao Picopresso or Flair Neo instead of the Dedica.
* My partner is hinting at wanting counter simplification offered by more automated/combination machines like the Ninja Luxe (also on sale). Hadn't really considered them in the past. So don't know as much about these setups other than the Luxe (due to Hoffman's video on it).
* Could just be happy with what works now. Sticking with Nespresso for another 6 months - year before diving deeper into the pocket.",1,1733124407.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

A.	Soybeans
B.	Coffee
C.	Leaks

Skills-
‚Ä¢	Charge Strength M (with a range, like charge strength s can be)
Scyther is the fastest Bug Berry gatherer in the game.
Scizor-
‚Ä¢	Skills Specialist
Kleavor- (if released)
‚Ä¢	Ingredients Specialist

The idea is that it plays off of their stat differences in the main games. 

If specialty switching isn‚Äôt allowed then I‚Äôd be happy with them remaining Berry, but swapping stats to be more effective in the other rolls, but less effective on Berries.

With a bug, poison, dragon island coming next, this would be a great release along with it.

The difference in the Charge Strength M skill would shake things up a bit, and Scizor can make a better all around mon in the new island than ampharos or golduck. 

If Kleavor Can be released as well, then I‚Äôd swap the ingredients to something a bit more rare maybe, but then the other 2 would have to have really slow Ingredient rates.

In fact I don't have siblings so he's really actually like a brother to me. We've been tight since the mid 90s, had so many incredible adventures together; music, books, drugs, travel, long nights staying up drinking coffee and discussing life and dreams and fears and girls and everything else under the sun. Honestly I love this man. We each had our own paths and life has turned out very different for us both, we live in different states with our wives but have kept in close contact and visit each other regularly. Like everyone does we've grown and evolved and changed as we've aged and, long story short, he's become a pretty vocal (and, worst of all, active online) supporter of a certain tv star politician who was recently re-elected to an office he held previously. I know you can read between the lines here. Now, I'm not a black and white thinker and am able to navigate the complexities and nuances of life but this has become just too much and I'm thinking of letting our lifelong friendship come to an end. I realize that I don't have to deny the value of our friendship just because I can't abide or respect the man he's grown into. Anyway, your thoughts? Am I making a mistake?

1h4pjpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1h4pjpg/and_there_goes_another_bottle/,And there goes another bottle ,"Yesterday I woke up feeling motivated. I got up, made my coffee, got my nail polish, went to watch t.v while I had my morning coffee. Regular morning for me. Spent time to myself thinking of all the ideas I have to do. I‚Äôve got my counselling homework, I‚Äôm three weeks into a confidence building program. I invited a friend out cause I was feeling like I needed to get out of the house for a bit. I finally got my painting easel set back up and have an idea I want to paint. It‚Äôs my rest day at the gym - usually the gym will keep me motivated. I worked on getting my counselling homework set up til my iPad died, it came back to say the application I was using for my counselling was overloaded. I have to delete the work I did to continue using it. 

I waited til 1pm for my mom to leave the house cause when she sees me doing stuff then she wants to comment and critique or ask me for favors, watching everything I do. By the time 1 pm rolled around, all the light in my living room in the basement was gone. I spent time thinking about how dark my basement gets with the little windows and thought it‚Äôd be nicer if I could go upstairs to all the windows. Now that my mom was at work, I could paint in peace. 

I brought my easel upstairs to work on my painting then realized, it‚Äôs snowing and all the natural light was gone. 

I was hungry, and left it til all my energy was gone. I made myself a sandwich and thought about what I can do now. 

I made my way to the room in the back that my mom has been using as a storage room and wants so badly to make into an art room. I thought, I can clean this up, have it as a separate space for when my basement living room gets too dark and depressing. I went to start but had no idea where to go from there. 

Now I am tired, eating didn‚Äôt bring my energy back. I have my counsellling homework I can‚Äôt work on right now, the painting I was planning on doing had no vibrancy without light, my plans for the evening were still unknown, it‚Äôs my rest day for the gym, no money til I get paid, t.v. Boring me. A nap meant it would be another day down where I didn‚Äôt do anything. I didn‚Äôt know where to start with the room and the feeling that all the work I was doing to try to keep myself feeling okay was worthless. I have no one to share it with. 

I just needed a bit of motivation, I needed a quick fix to get over the depressive thoughts settling in. A bottle of wine was motivating, maybe then I could stop worrying so much about *how to* get started and actually *get* started. 

So I walked to the corner store, one last bid to try to motivate myself out of wanting a drink. It didn‚Äôt work, I walked right in and bought the bottle. 

Walked home thinking about my counselling, I should attempt that before I open the bottle. I sit and have a text that a client is going into the hospital, asking me to work, but I have plans for the evening. I open the bottle as I investigate why my client is in the hospital. Considering picking up the overnight shift, but I would have to cancel and I could really use time out of the house that is not work or the gym. I don‚Äôt cope well after doing an overnight anyway. 

I started to drink, so counselling is out now. I go upstairs, still no light. So I grab the bottle and go to the back room to clean, drink and listen to a memoire (educated by Tara Westlover). This is when I get the text from my friend bailing.  I wish I had pictures of the before I reorganized the room, so now we have room. I can see the floor; I have space to paint now, now my mom will be relieved that the work is mostly done. She just has to go through her boxes of stuff she doesn‚Äôt know what to do with but it‚Äôs organized. 

I get a text from my mom, it‚Äôs now time to make supper before she gets home. I go to start supper and realize‚Ä¶. The bottle of wine is done. 

Supper was great, my mom was happy that I cleaned up, I‚Äôm definitely drunk at this point trying to keep it together for mom so she doesn‚Äôt notice. We listen to the memoire during supper, so I don‚Äôt really have to talk. After supper I tell her I‚Äôm going to bed to listen to the memoire. I get to bed close my eyes, I don‚Äôt know when I fell asleep but I know it was really early considering how early I woke up this morning. 
Feeling shameful another bottle down and another day using it as my motivation cause it‚Äôs another day I couldn‚Äôt find it in myself. 

If you made it this far thank you for reading. I don‚Äôt know what I want out of this post - I guess to admit that here‚Äôs another day given to alcohol. ",3,1733124152.0,stopdrinking,2,1.0,False

I started at 16 and even tho I tried to stop, I can't. I know it's bad for everything and everyone but I just can't stop, this and coffee are the only things that help with my extreme anxiety. 
For some more context, I try to be a ""respectful smoker"" if it is a thing. I never smoke inside other people houses, never throw the filters on the floor or anything and I always ask if it's okay to lite one when im with other people,and never smoke when there's kids around.  and never never have I ever asked no one to buy me cigarettes due to lack of money.
The thing is, my closest friends have the idea that it's okay to give me cigarettes as a gift on my birthday or when they come to my house, or Christmas. It's like ""I didn't had money to buy a big present but I know you like this"".
I had already noticed that but the last straw was the other day when one of my friends asked if I could do her makeup for a party. I said yes with no intention to charge anything for that. When I was done she gave me some money and said ""I know your work is worth so much more but at least you can buy a pack of cigarettes""
I said thank u, but felt so uncomfortable, like, im not poor or anything and I can absolutely buy my own cigs, I always carry my own pack and even share with other friends that ""don't smoke"" but always ask for one or 2.
So, I was thinking, since when did being a smoker become my whole personality? 
Being completely honest, it's something I've always been ashamed of. I never speak about that, it's not even a topic in my convos. And now im starting to feel even more ashamed, I feel like the worst kind of addicted (I know I am). It's like they didn't even know me or what I like. I love make up, no big brands just makeup. I love crochet, I love sewing, I love reading and things like color pencils and a cute notebook. 
Idk what to do, I don't wanna get cigarettes on my birthday anymore but I don't wanna be rude. I know this is not a big or serious problem but I feel bad about it. ",9,1733123765.0,amiwrong,13,0.91,False

this might be all over the place & lengthy but feels like a safe space to rant. for some background, i‚Äôm 26 & have suspected i had pcos for years now. my whole life i‚Äôve had super long, heavy, painful periods. i got put on the pill to help which it didn‚Äôt, i tried 2 or 3 different types before i got switched over to the kyleena iud (i still have it in), which can & in my case, has stopped my period completely. i wasn‚Äôt always too overweight but always struggled with how fast i gain weight (30lbs within 3 months before). now i am really overweight & no matter what i do i cannot lose it like before. i struggle some mental health issues as well & have been on & off meds for years (officially off now) so im sure that can effect weight too. i really noticed a change in my facial hair about 5 ish years ago when it felt like all of a sudden i had soo much more hair on my chin & face. i shave every single day & when i don‚Äôt it gets so bad my family has even commented on it & im constantly insecure about it. it‚Äôs even made me skin worse, so dry & flaky & bumpy now.  i never had acne, i‚Äôd get some cystic pimples here & there but lately that‚Äôs been worse too. on top of this making me feel like shit mentally, it‚Äôs ruining me physically too & it feels so suffocating. as much as my bf & friends try to talk to me or give advice, it feels like i‚Äôm alone in it bc they don‚Äôt know the feeling. 

the gynaecologist told me my insulin levels look ok but my DHEAS hormone was a little high & my testosterone was 83% where as the average women is around 36%. one of my biggest fears is infertility, i know it isn‚Äôt necessarily impossible but it terrifies me. i know stress contributes to pcos too but that seems impossible to avoid with personal things like living situation, financial situation & on top of that just feeling like i‚Äôm watching my body get worse when im putting in effort to change it. 

i‚Äôve been trying to eat healthier before getting diagnosed & working out (mainly cardio) however, since getting diagnosed this is what i‚Äôve been doing:

- tracking all meals & aiming for 30-40g of protein per meal 
- cardio (walking) on treadmill for minimum 30 minutes as much as i can during the week but usually is 2-3 days 
- weight lifting 1 day a week
- taking supplements (1000g of vitamin d, 500mg inositol, 500mg magnesium) 
- 2 glasses of spearmint tea a day 
- limited caffeine to one coffee a week, or decaf & a small glass of coke zero a couple times a week 

my meals usually consist of something like this: 
- breakfast: high protein, low sugar overnight oats 
- lunch: chicken, veggies & quinoa
- dinner: salmon, veggies
- snack: apple, fruit, tuna w almond crackers (these are some options)
i eat around 1478 calories a day.
i was intermittent fasting before but i don‚Äôt know (not sure if i should). i sometimes eat out or ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù once a week if me & my bf go out to eat but it isn‚Äôt completely bad day of eating 

i lost 4 pounds then gained 2 back & its been 2 months of this now. i‚Äôm beyond frustrated & feel so defeated & alone. i‚Äôve heard berberine can help & just ordered some off amazon. any tips would be helpful at this point im sure there‚Äôs stuff i need to change / learn but not sure who to turn to. i have an appointment with endocrinologist in february to look into my hormone levels so hoping they help me. my gyno did say metformin could be an option but to come back when im looking to have a kid to get started if need be. right now i would like to avoid medication & try to help naturally. everything about pcos is frustrating me. i‚Äôm tired all the time, im in school full time & work most of the time im not in school. my facial hair is driving me insane & the weight is such a struggle it has completely destroyed my already low self esteem.

1h4pfp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/1h4pfp5/how_we_accidentally_became_beekeepers/,How We Accidentally Became Beekeepers,"It was a crisp October evening, the kind where you can feel the seasons shifting, and my brother and I were doing what we often did‚Äîplaying video games on our PCs, a couple of beers in hand. The sound of clacking keyboards and virtual explosions filled the room when suddenly, during a lull in the game, I decided to browse the internet. That‚Äôs when it happened.

I have this habit, you see, of making late-night, slightly tipsy purchases. Usually, it‚Äôs harmless‚Äîmaybe a quirky gadget or some obscure book‚Äîbut that night was different. I stumbled upon a website advertising bees for $125. Not just any bees‚Äîthree pounds of them. The listing was framed like a once-in-a-lifetime deal: 3 lbs of bees and a queen for just $125! And in that moment, it made perfect sense. My brother glanced over, half-amused, and said, ""You‚Äôre not really going to buy bees, are you?"" To which I confidently replied, ""Of course I am! What a bargain!""

The next morning, I woke up, coffee in hand, and thought, Did I buy bees last night? A quick check of my email confirmed it‚Äîorder placed, payment received, and our bees were set to arrive in April. I showed my brother the email, and after a long silence, he just said, ‚ÄúGuess we‚Äôre beekeepers now.‚Äù

At first, it was a joke. We knew nothing about bees, except that they made honey, and that stings hurt. But as the months passed, something shifted. We couldn‚Äôt just let these bees show up without being ready. So, we buckled down.

We watched every beekeeping video YouTube had to offer, joined local groups, and ordered a couple of books with titles like Beekeeping for Dummies. We learned about hives, frames, nectar flows, and the mysterious waggle dance. We discovered that bees communicate with one another through vibrations and that their entire existence depends on a well-organized queen-led system. It was fascinating. Suddenly, what started as a drunken impulse became a shared mission.

We ordered hive kits and spent weekends in the garage assembling them, sanding down the wood, and coating the frames in a thick layer of beeswax. It wasn‚Äôt easy‚Äîthere were moments of frustration, sawdust everywhere, and more than one argument about the ""right"" way to hammer a frame together. But by April, our hives were ready.

Then came bee day. The bees arrived in two wooden packages, each buzzing with life. We had our protective gear, a smoker to keep the bees calm, and the hives set up in the perfect spot in the backyard. We carefully opened the packages and introduced the bees to their new homes. To our amazement, they seemed to settle in right away, exploring the frames and getting to work like they‚Äôd always belonged there.

Standing there, watching thousands of bees adjust to the space we‚Äôd prepared, we felt something unexpected: pride. We‚Äôd built this. And the bees‚Äîwell, they seemed happy.

That was the beginning of something far bigger than we ever anticipated. Beekeeping became more than a hobby; it became a way of life. It taught us patience, respect for nature, and the incredible interconnectedness of the world around us. What started as a late-night whim turned into a passion that‚Äôs shaped who we are today.

And yes, we still laugh about it‚Äîbecause really, who buys bees at 1 a.m.? Turns out, we do.",1,1733123682.0,Beekeeping,1,1.0,False

We went out on Friday and had a really good time. Started to play a card game but the cafe closed. When we were packing up, she mentioned that she'd like to play again. I figured this indicated she was interested in going out another time.

On Saturday I asked her to do something this week, but she mentioned that she'll probably be busy until the end of the semester. I accepted that and told her to let me know if she has some free time. 

Today I went skating with friends, an activity that her and I talked about, so I sent her a picture. Her response was ""Where is it..?"" as she's new to the city. We are are both slow at texting so I haven't responded yet. I could tease her and tell her that she can find out if she gors with me, or just tell her where it is.

Even decaf coffee gives me major headaches.

If I drink soda, tea, energy drinks, you name it, I feel fine. I haven't had coffee in over a month and I feel good. I have had caffeine just not coffee. The one thing that helps me with cravings is if I want a coffee and I'm near a place that sells it, I just start thinking about the worst headache I ever had that was the result of drinking coffee. I just wait and drink a tea or something. 

I discovered this because as per usual I was quitting coffee and during a craving I got a smoothie with an energy boost (caffiene). And I had no bad side effects. So I kept going strictly no coffee, then I thought well I can try a decaf, then bam headaches from hell. Then a week later I tried 1/3 of an energy drink, just for the hell of it, which has more caffiene than decaf, and still no side effects. Just like feeling pretty good.

1h4oz7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofReligion/comments/1h4oz7b/outlining_a_perspective_on_what_religion_is/,üëãüèº Outlining a Perspective on what Religion is; Religion‚Äôs Actuality & Legitimacy; and Religion‚Äôs value: Seeking Critical Discourse/Intellectual Stimulation/‚ÄúCoffee Talk‚Äù about such Matters! üôÄ,"Howdy. üëãüèº

I‚Äôm seeking a bit on intellectual stimulation. I enjoy having casual discussion about these matters. So, I‚Äôm going to state my perspective, and hope individuals will pop by, and engage, and critique my perspective. I‚Äôm interested in having a discussion. I am interested in learning the how & why of perspectives & critiques, particularly ones that oppose mine. 

Alright, that said:

A. What Religion is!

So, I am of the perspective that humans as such are perennially concerned with with three things:

1. Why is there existence, why do they, in particular exist.  
2. What will happen after their existence ends. What happens after they taste death.  
3. Taking the answered provided to the aforementioned two, via a particular narrative as such, what must be done ‚Äî which may extend to ritual, prayer, and being as such ‚Äî to ensure that one has ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù in this cycle of existence & the one to follow is provided. 

Thus, a Religion, and a Religious Tradition, is one that answers the aforementioned questions. In particular provides prescriptions, as far as being as such is concerned, predicated on the answered provided to the first two questions. 

B. That said, what is the actuality & legitimacy of Religion?  Here‚Äôs my perspective: 

I am of a Critical Realist perspective, in particular that of a Neoplatonist Metaphysics of a Plotinus. Thus, I am of the perspective that perception is relative, but the actuality of things is independent of perspective, perception, and wishful want. That said, the answers to the aforementioned three perennial questions/concerns is conception. The actuality of conception is predicated on the hermeneutic, and if the consequent conception & hermeneutic is an adequation to the actuality of things. 

Thus, ontology, and morality, that is predicated on ontology, is objective; thus Religion as such may be assessed in matters actuality, and legitimacy. 

Legitimacy being ‚Äùwhat should be allowed‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs understood that we are able to know the actuality of things, that is to say we are able to understand, to intellect, the nature of existence, understand about matters metaphysics as such, or we will never be able to recognize it, and to verify it, if we were told about it, or to run into it. This whole exchange would be pointless, and discourse about the Philosophy of Religion as such would be pointless if we were not able to verify in matters metaphysics as such. 

Thus, inferring the actuality, and also partaking in the critique of religion is possible via a Perennialist Perspective, which I am of, and which the aforementioned is a perspective of. 

C. Finally, what is consequently the value of Religion? Here‚Äôs my perspective: 

Religion does not tell one ‚Äúhow to think‚Äù. What religion does is tell one ‚Äúwhat to think‚Äù. Religion answers the Perennial Question 3. And it does so via prescriptions. And via these prescriptions indirectly tells people ‚Äúhow to think‚Äù. But never does so directly. Religion, when legitimate, is a ‚Äúrope‚Äù for the ‚Äúblind‚Äù. Religion, when legitimate, is a guide for those whose intellects need to be objectified, and to think for them as their intellect are not able to used.  

When a Religion is not legitimate it‚Äôs nothing more nor less than an opiate for the masses to manipulate the masses for respective ends by an institution as such. It does not empower the individual. It robs the individual. No longer is the religion for the individual, for the individual‚Äôs empowerment & peace, but the individual becomes for the religion and robbed of his, or her, empowerment via manipulation of the imaginative faculty of the individual. 

That said, witnessing the legitimacy of a religious tradition as such, I am of the perspective that the value of a Religion is ‚Äúredundant‚Äù relative to a ‚Äúreligious‚Äù tradition that teaches people ‚Äúhow to think‚Äù, and not ‚Äùwhat to think‚Äù. 

A Tradition, a consequent religion, that is ‚ÄúPhilosophy as Principle & as Way‚Äù is a greater, and a far superior ‚ÄúReligion‚Äú than religion as such, as it teaches individuals to value the actual, to treat the other as one would treat oneself, and to live a life of value predicated on the actual‚Ä¶ to seek a legitimate existence. All this via an education system that wishes to teach the use of one‚Äôs intellectual faculty, one‚Äôs rational & imaginative faculty, so that one may realize the answers to the perennial questions oneself. 

This whole post is me thinking out loud. I‚Äôm just here for some critical discourse; critique of my perspective; for some ‚Äúcoffee talk‚Äù, for some intellectual stimulation.  

Yep! So, if you disagree with me‚Ä¶ please: respectfully, FIGHT ME! I‚Äôm interested in the how & why you find yourself disagreeing with me.

1h4owpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/StandingDesk/comments/1h4owpi/thoughts_on_the_flexispot_odin_1week_review/,Thoughts on the FlexiSpot Odin - 1-week review,"I had posted a few weeks ago to discuss my decision process re: getting a stable standing desk. I ended up going with the FlexiSpot Odin on account of the 4-leg design.

Ordering/receiving experience was good, no issues whatsoever and it arrived scary fast. Make sure you have someone on hand to help you because carrying those boxes is a bear.

Assembly was not hard. I put together a bunch of Ikea furniture in my time but I am by no means an expert. I am not a big guy but I was able to put together the whole thing, flip it and place it by myself (if you feel uneasy about the last par though, you may want to get someone to assist you as there is some potential to hurt oneself).

My main gripe with assembly is that the pre-drilled wholes on the tabletop were misaligned. This seems to be a recurring issue with this type of furniture and I just don't understand it. I can go out right now and buy a $40 Ikea coffee table which is basically made of cardboard and still will have holes pre-drilled with millimetre precision. It feels like it should be possible to sort out this type of thing. Luckily the ""bamboo"" tabletop material is fairly soft, so I was able to push the screws through with my screwdriver - without the need to drill more holes.

The table is very stable. If stability is your #1 concern, you will probably want to take a look at this one. Seated, it is as stable as a stationary desk of good quality. Standing, it will wobble a tiny bit but it is minimal and it does not bother me, and I am quite paranoid about things like that.

Now, the part that is causing me to consider returning the frame is - if you are the type of person who, like me, prefers to keep your seated height as low as possible, this may not be for you. The standard bamboo tabletop is fairly thick (about 1.5 inches), and below that you get a sturdy crossbar which accounts for 1.5"" more. As a result, you can't go very low without the crossbar hitting your thighs. My preferred setup is to set the table very low so I can get the keyboard at the right height without a tray, and use a monitor raiser to bring up my screen at eye level. Getting there with this table is quite hard as it will hit my legs when it gets slightly below 28"".

Ultimately, I am still pondering what to do. The height issue is annoying, but the stability is hard to beat. EOM.",1,1733121528.0,StandingDesk,0,1.0,False
1h4ove5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReddXReads/comments/1h4ove5/tales_of_community_college_the_one_who_has_it_bad/,Tales of Community College: The One Who has it Bad (part 8) ,"Hello Reddx and fellow Reddx fans, I'm back with another tale about our ""favorite"" sweet home Alabama cousins who became apparent that they have a uhhhh ""lover's quarrel"" but not realizing one relative is trying to fucked them over. First thing first, I want to say sorry for not writing sooner, November is a busy time for me. Since I have time and was remined how Goodfella was really just verdictive petty bish! Once again we're starting off where we left off. Also, sorry for my bad grammar due to me being bilingual. You know English is evil when ""Colonel"" has an ""R"" sound.

**LET'S LOOK AT THIS SEASON'S LINE UP!**

**Dizzy:** Hello it's me. 19 years old, still being push around but will cut the bullshit if pushed too far. Just realized I'm trans but ""can't"" transition just yet.

**Queenie:** The Good, The Bad and The UGGGH! The 20 year old stalker lady who's down bad for Artlad. The one half of our classic Alabama couple.

**Bonbon:** The lady going for the gold medal for fast development of the Beetus‚Ñ¢ ever at the age of 21. She's here to ""yaaaas Queen!"" her friend's ego.

**Goodfella:** The 18 year old who has to deal with the Alabama couple. At the time, he's my new friend when my old high school ""friend"" left me to clean up his mess. Homie is our petty ring-leader.

**Bestbro:** The big brother I wish I had. 19 years old and he only appears briefly with some news. More on that later.

**NOW LET'S START OFF THIS KICK OFF!**

Where we left off, is Goodfella and I meeting up to make up some bullshit traits to give to Queenie right after I ""came out"" to Goodfella. I've written this in my journal wondering, why did I told Goodfella about my gender identity but I guess I figured he's part of LGBTQ community and has came out to his family, I thought he was the best person to come out first, a lot of my friends at the time are straight however I'm getting ahead of myself. So we're at the library writing down traits.

**Me: I'm thinking we should write down ""Artlad loves when girls are soft spoken and let him ramble about art"".**

**Goodfella: I see what you're trying to do but I feel she'll try to challenge that.**

**Me: My question is how much she'll change herself just to be with Artlad? I feel horrible saying it and I can't live with myself for basically erasing her personality.**

**Goodfella: Dizzy, Queenie is stalking Artlad as if they are dating! She called you a homewrecker for fuck's sake.**

**Me: True, but my question still stands.**

**Goodfella: I haven't seen Queenie act this way so I'm pretty sure she'll try some of these traits. Plus, her ""taking down the beauty standards, big girls are better"" bullshit is something she's trying out.**

**Me: What do you mean ""trying out""? She's not a teenager.**

Do people ready still pretend or ""have a phase"" even they are adults? Now I know the answer is ""maybe"".  

**Goodfella: Dude before starting college, Queenie was one of those ""gamer girls who actually played video games and not for male attention"" when she was THE girl she was mocking.**

**Me: I mean, did she actually play video games?**

**Goodfella: HELL NO! The only reason she talked about video games because Sourface played said video games.**

**Me: Having one Pick-me‚Ñ¢ phase as a teenager doesn't mean she'll change her ideals. I bet it was a long time ago.** 

**Goodfella: Pfft, no! This was two years ago. Her high school freshmen phase was she pretended be this honor student even though she' was basically getting good enough marks. And don't get me started with her emo phase when that didn't work out.**

I just rise an eyebrow. You can guess just by this conversation is not only they went to high school together (probably since forever) but also he might have witness some cringe-y things. Key work is ""might"" because the way he speaks kinda feels he was just talking crap just because. 

**Me: I know this going to sound dick-ish but was she always a uhhhhh......big girl?**

**Goodfella: Honey, look at me, Sourface and Queenie now. We always been big. That's what happens when you come from a family of fat people.**

**Me: I'm not saying it just because big people can't get love, I'm saying it if she's willing to do anything for a guy she likes.** (I was wondering if she had tried dating for a guy and explains this whole H.A.E.S bs) 

**Goodfella: No shit she'll do it for a guy, what else is the reason to be a Pick-me‚Ñ¢.**

**Me: Is this H.A.E.S. crap a phase for a guy? I doubt this is for Artlad.**

**Goodfella: Come to think of it, I don't know.**

**Me: You don't? You were so sure about Queenie's attentions and now you don't?**

**Goodfella: I doubt she's doing it just because. Maybe she's trying to convince herself or find a way to convince a guy to like her.**

**Me: Number one, why can't she be herself and Number two, when this ""relationship"" started with Sourface?**

Goodfella just rubs his face and takes a deep breath before looking back me.

**Goodfella: To tell you the truth, this shit started around middle school.**

**Me: Huh-uh. And were they that secret about it? I highly doubt it and this whole thing about your family funding you is not really believable.**

**Goodfella: Look, my uncle has money but not ""fuck-you"" money. He works a job that pays really well and since he doesn't kids of his own and married someone with a kid and only has my brother and I, well he said he wanted to help out.** 

**Me: Still, I'm not sure. Also you didn't answer if they keep it a secret.**

**Goodfella: No, that's why they got caught.**

I don't really remember the rest of we said since this took place years but I'm pretty sure that we just talked back and forth about the traits Artlad ""loved"" in a woman and me questioning about if Sourface's and Goodfella's uncle funding was real or an excuse/lie to make Goodfella less of a bad person. I guess we just drop it for now. 

In my journal, I wrote down I was becoming a bad person because I was playing with a girls emotions and putting myself in a bad place in order to mess with Sourface's hope as well. Looking back with 20/20 vision, I could have just notify the campus about Sourface's actions and hope for the best even though the campus won't have done anything but they however would have just give him a warning or maybe that would have been worst? I don't know. Next we started writing Artlad's ""traits"" to give to Sourface but Goodfella""s phone started to rang he had to excuse himself, so he left and I was there alone while he did his thing but when he came back he look like he saw a ghost.

**Me: Dude, what happened? You ok?**

**Goodfella: NO! It's sourface! He wants me to meet up with him!**

**Me: What for?**

**Goodfella: He wants to see Queenie. Since she told everybody that she was staying with me when she wasn't. Now he wants to come to my place and talk to her for god knows what.**

**Me: And you didn't tell him the truth?**

**Goodfella: He talked over me so, no I couldn't.**

He then goes on explaining how Sourface was really bugging him to make Queenie talk to Sourface. Yet she hasn't answering Sourface's nor other family member's calls/texts. I however, was getting responses from her due to the fact I was ""helping her"" get her man. But, I got an idea and told Goodfella to tell Sourface that she's busy and she's ""going to call him back when to she's free"" that way it gives us time. He just looks at me like he's going to say no but asks ""why"" and all I've said ""just trust me"". If he's going going to me in the dark then tell me in the last minute then I should too.

**Me: Look Goodfella, I can write Artlad's traits on my own since I know him. You need to handle your brother and that way he doesn't think that something is up. I don't know how that'll look since you know Sourface better then I do.**

**Goodfella:** \*sigh\* **You're right. I'll tell him to meet me later so I can ""explain"" to him. But that means YOU  have to meeting up with Queenie alone.**

**Me: I think I'm fine when it comes to Queenie. Right now, she's the most important for me to plant the seeds of ""hope"". Plus, I need to contact a mutual friend of Artlad and I.**

**Goodfella: Ok. Fine. I'm heading now. This better work.**

He heads out and soon after I do too. I kinda remember texting Queenie saying that I have her list of things that Artlad ""likes"" and asking where are we meeting up. Y'all, if I told you that Queenie was SO happy about getting ""her man"", would be an under statement. She was sending me text after text saying *""oooohhh Artlad, I'm so gald you're helping me! I can't wait to have an official date him instead from the a far""*. I did not ask what that meant nor did I want to know. However I've said:

**Me: No problem Queenie. I'm still not ready to go back the club. Has anyone ask for me? Or asked why I'm not there?**

**Queenie: YES! Artlad himself. For some reason, when Artlad us the reason why you didn't came to the last one. Sourface was asking Artlad if you where sick or thing. PFFFT, as if he cared. It's not like he likes-likes you, I know he's doing it to create drama.**

**Me: Yeah, I figured. So see later?**

**Queenie: Of course** ***bestie.*** \*followed by a shit ton of emojis\*

At the same time, I was texting Bestbro. Even though I don't want to talk to Artlad, I was worried about him. Bestbro did say he was fine, Artlad was giving some space and seems he wanted to talk to me but I can't. Bestbro was wandering why I wasn't talking to him if I was so worried about him and what not. But did say that him and Artlad aren't in the best terms right now. Bestbro seems he can't trust him after what he did to me. I felt a mix of emotions and I wandering if me going with Goodfella's idea was right move. I knew the Queenie and Sourface aren't nice to me (well ok one ""likes"" me because I'm close to her crush and the other is just creepy and using me to get under the first person's skin but still) I couldn't just stooped to their level. Yet, here I was doing that but that thought left my mind when Queenie texted

**Queenie: Hey my last class got cancelled for today so I free now. Want meet up now?**

**Me: Yeah sure. Today was a free day for me. Meet you there.**

So I headed to the parking lot where Sourface found me in part 4. It's wasn't a big campus and to my shock, Queenie was waiting for me with Bonbon. I wasn't expecting Bonbon to be there but I tried to play it cool.

**Me: Oh hey Bonbon. I didn't know you and Queenie where hanging out.**

**Bonbon: Humft, when I heard you were helping Queenie with Artlad, I wanted see for myself if you were telling the truth.**

**Queenie: Now now Bonbon, Dizzy is trying to repay me for her actions. Plus, it's her fault that she's a homewrecker because of Artlad.**

Ok NOW she's trying to get under my skin. But I bit my tongue and let myself be Bish made once more.

**Me: Look Bonbon, there's nothing going on with me and Artlad but I was a bad friend to Queenie. I know how she feels about him and I wasn't helping her.**

**Bonbon: Whatever, what matters that you're helping her. Now get in my car, heading back to my place.**

**Me: Huh? Your place? We're not talking here?**

**Queenie: NO! Are you kidding me? I don't want Artlad or sou......Ahhh someone finding out what we are doing. I feel safer if we talk at Bonbon's place.**

I just nodded, I followed them to Bonbon's car. Now, let me just nerd out a bit about Bonbon's car. Since my father was a mechanic and studied that back when he was my age and has worked on many different types of cars, trucks and SUVs and in he's last 10 years before retiring he worked on big-rigs, you learn to love cars. Bonbon's car was an 2007 Audi A4 Avant wagon and was ""sandy tan"" (I don't the color's name) I still remember that car cuz it was spacious and they were big girls too.(not trying to be mean I just thought I might be in for a long and cramped ride and I don't like to be physically close to people) However, when I entered the backseat, it was covered in fast food wrappers, A LOT of Starbucks cups and just boxes upon boxes of those chocolates you get from candy stores. Like the ones you buy from the pound and those boxes weren't small. I sat the only sit that wasn't covered, I guess that's where Ms. Mal-Doll or Queenie sat when hanging out. I haven't meet anyone with that amount of trash in their car back then nor since. As I buckled my seatbelt, I asked:

**Me: So Bonbon, you live near campus?**

**Bonbon: Yes, I've moved here since better to be close and I had the money.**

**Queenie: Why? Are planning to move?**

**Me: I live near this city, I just take the train to and from school.**

**Queenie: You mean the train station that's like 45 minutes from campus walking?**

**Me: Yeah, it's not really a big deal for me since I'm used to walking to and from places. Plus the area I live a lot stores are near by so, I just walk.**

**Queenie: Uhhhg! Walking everywhere is sooooo stupid. You need to learn how to drive or you walk because you want the guys looking at you?**

What's so wrong about walking? Driving everywhere is such an American thing and maybe, I want smell the fresh air. Also I'm not even good looking and I'm not saying in a low self-esteem kind of way, I saying it in a ""I just rolled out of bad and I'm too lazy to put effort on what pants should I wear"" But I answered:

**Me: No it's not that. I like to walk because I like to be in deep thought and walking helps me think clearly.**

**Bonbon: Now I see why you and Artlad are friends, both of you like hikes.**

Yes I do like walking but not hikes. I hate being away for more then a couple of hours cuz I like my video games. Being an Introvert does not mean, I don't touch grass. And I've told as such:

**Me: No I don't like hikes, even though I like to walk but that doesn't mean I want to be near all the bugs and rocks and stuff.**

**Bonbon: Riiiight. So it's hiking one things Artlad wants a girl to like?**

**Me:** \*trying to smirk and playing it cool\* **Oh yeah totally, that's why me and him are just friends. I have more since I gathered what I know about Artlad in a nice little list.**

**Queenie: Ooooooh Artlad\~ I hope our first date will one to remember\~ I want to tell it to our future kids!**

**Bonbon: And you will girl! Artlad IS your man. No if's, and's or but's.**

My ""shit-eating grin"" was easy to hide because was basically wiped away cuz how can one person be that delulu! She was so sure that she was getting Artlad's heart. I was both shocked and pleased cuz putting Goodfella's plan for Queenie was ""easy"". trying to be neutral I added

**Me: I mean I hope so. Artlad's record when it comes to girls is not good.**

**Queenie: Like I said, he just needs a good woman to get his shit together.**

**Bonbon: And Queenie is that woman.** 

**Me: I just hope me helping you doesn't mess things up. I mean for the club.**

**Bonbon: You better prey it doesn't. Otherwise it's on sight!**

Oooh I'm soooo scared at a girl who spends half of her college loan on sugary drinks./s I don't know if she did get a loan but that doesn't matter nor did I care, I find it funny Bonbon really did want to lay hands on me for a ""friend"" that couldn't give two shits about her. More on that later.

**Me: Don't worry, I'll try my best** \*trying not to show anger\*

**Bonbon: Ok! We're here! Welcome to my home!**

This was years ago but I still remember that Bonbon lived in this really nice apartment complex. I'm talking luxury apartments. I was curious on how the hell Bonbon could afford to live in that apartment while being a student, in California. I wrote down ""the entrance of the apartment was gated and the design look Santa Fe style. Lots of artisan tiles"". I asked: 

**Me: Wow you really live here? How much is the rent here?**

**Bonbon: I don't know. It's my aunt's apartment and she's letting me have it while she and her family are moving.**

**Queenie: It's so nice to be independent and not needing a man to pay. Us girls need to look after yourselves.**

We get out the car and head to Bonbon's place. It was on the second floor and taking the elevator all the while Bonbon telling me to ""wipe your feet on the mat, I don't want dirt in my home"" before opening her home to me. I feel like me wiping my shoes was a moot point because the apartment was filled with MORE fast food wrappers and Starbucks cups. We headed towards the kitchen and Bonbon just moved the trash that was on the table on top of the kitchen counter. I don't know why this was imprinted in my memory but the only clean thing I saw was the stove, it seems it wasn't in use. As we sat down, Bonbon offered make me a cup of ""coffee"".

**Bonbon: I'll you guys some coffee and then we can get started.**

**Me: Thanks for offering but there's no need for me.**

**Queenie: Come on Dizzy, try Bonbon's coffee. She makes it really good.**

**Bonbon: I'll make it now.**

she goes off to her coffee maker that honestly have seen better days. Bonbon then pulls out sugar, coffee-creamer, syrups, just a lot of things when Queenie asks:

**Queenie: So do you really have a list of things Artlad likes?**

**Me: Oh! Y-yes of course, I have it right here.** (I then go into my bag pull out the list and telling myself to NOT fuck this up!) **I know it's a long list but I've him since high school and I'm just trying to cover my bases.**

**Bonbon: Wow, does he really like all of this things** \*she says while holding a tray of our coffee\*

**Queenie: Oh come on Bonbon, this is why we're here. We need to talk it and set-up a date with him too!**

Panic-mode activated!

**Me: Woah! Woah there Queenie! We don't want to scare him off by being too ready. Women should make their man wait!** (I'm hoping to play off her ""gals before pals"" thinking)

**Bonbon:** \*sits down\* **Ok ok, here's your coffee.**

Now the one thing about me is sometimes I enjoy my coffee with cream and sugar but I prefer straight black. The coffee she gave me look barely brown and as soon I took my first sip, it was hella sweet like ""you want coffee for your cream and sugar"" type of sweet. I thought about people not liking the taste of black coffee and just pouring sugar upon sugar, you just want sugar. Bonbon's coffee was so sweet, that it hurt my teeth and I was trying not to make a face because I was raise to respect the host/hostess home and STFU.

**Me:** \*trying not to cough\* **Thank you bonbon. Your coffee is.......nice.**

**Queenie: Now show me the list.**

I handed the list, I don't remember the bull-crap that I wrote but I somewhat remember her reaction since I noted it in my journal.

**Queenie: What do you mean he likes soft spoken girls?!**

**Me: Well, that's what he likes. He may not have a type but I did notice he tends to date girls who seem meek.**

**Bonbon: Does the girl really have to let him rant about art?**

**Me: Well duh, he's been making art since forever! You seen his art.**

**Bonbon: This fucking list is bull. A self respecting woman would never change herself for a man! Right Queenie! .........Queenie?** \*looks at her\*

Queenie remand quite when reading the list. I think half of ""traits"" was just me and Goodfella fucking around but I did put some things that Artlad really did like in a girl, or at less the common traits I notice in every girl he's ever dated.

**Me: Huh Queenie? You good?**

**Queenie: HUH? oh yes, I'm fine but I don't think I'm changing myself for a man. I have these traits already!**

**Me: Oh that's good to hear.**

**Bonbon: Huh you do? I haven't seen you do half the stuff on this list?**

**Queenie: Shut up Bonbon! What I do in my free time is nobody's business! What have you gone on a date with a man as handsome as Artlad? I think NOT!**

**Bonbon:** \*sinks little in her sit\* **Y-you're right Queenie....I never been on a date with a good-looking guy. It's always you to date those guys and last time you dated the guy I was interested in.** (I hope she doesn't mean Sourface, then again if she's anything like Queenie, the guy might have been skinny as fuck) 

**Queenie: He was dick anyway. I'm always the woman men wants. You shouldn't be sad, I sure there's a man desperate enough to date girls like you and Dizzy.**

Fuck. You. Queenie. This statement has stayed with for a long time, not only I came to realized I was trans but the one thing trans people fear is how they look makes people not want to date them. (again it wasn't a self-esteem issue) I was taken back by that because it sounds like Queenie, is one those girls who goes out of her way to date her ""friend's"" crush. I was starting to feel bad for Bonbon, but like I said in part 2, I love ch√≠sme and inner Mexican auntie kicked in and I wanted to get info to use against Queenie.

**Me: Oh\~ prey tell\~! Tell me girl, have you got lucky before meeting Artlad?** (I wanna vom!)

**Queenie: Yes and no, there's not many guys that aren't man enough to be with a woman with curves. Bonbon is my friend and a good friend would tell truth to her friends even if said friends thinks you being mean.**

I did not want to know what she means by ""tell the truth"" but what caught my ears is the ""yes and no"". If this mean-fat girl is getting ""lucky"", then I can use that info for Sourface. Yes I know I'm a dick but I was getting a rush by doing this. I know I wasn't any better then the people I was messing with. 

**Me: What do mean by ""yes and no"". Also our campus is not that big too.**

**Queenie: Yes the is not big but I was seeing.......someone else before starting last semester.**

**Bonbon: You never told me you were dating someone.**

**Queenie: I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING!**

**Bonbon:** \*sinks even lower\* **I-I-I'm sorry Queenie, you always say that friends tell friends everything and-**

**Queenie: YEAH THAT'S BECAUSE YOU GUYS HIDE EVERYTHING! AND-**

**Me: hey hey calm down, there's need to shout. Come on sis, spill the tea and share to us. Come on Queenie. I sure Bonbon did mean anything bad right?** (again, I know I'm a dick)

**Bonbon: Yes, I just want to know what my friends are doing and have a little keekee about it.**

**Queenie: Well it's complicated.**

**Me: Oh? how so?** \*trying to look concern\*

**Queenie: He doesn't like the idea of me being smart and he told me to drop out.**

**Bonbon: THAT'S HORRIABLE! Tell me you dropped his ass!**

**Queenie: Of course I did! I don't need a man like him! I don't want hear him going on and on about the college fund!**

**Me: College fund? You mean like a loan?**

I was starting to wander if what Goodfella was saying is true.

**Queenie: I wouldn't be caught dead with student debt. No my step-dad is paying for me and he's also helping other family members too.**

**Me: OH! I didn't know, Must be nice to have someone help you out? Is he helping out your step-siblings?** \*playing dumb\* (as if I don't have info but I was doubtful if what Goodfella was saying is true)

**Queenie: I don't have step-siblings, my step-dad never had kids. I'm his only ""kid"" but it's whatever.**

**Bonbon: Then who's the family members your dad is helping out?**

**Me: Yeah, what happens in this apartment, stays in this apartment.** (LIES ALL LIES)

**Queenie: Not really important, anyway after I dump him he started to get clingy and......well uhh**

**Me: What? Was he....you know.....""pushy"".**

**Bonbon: Like?**

**Me: you know like.....call the cops ""pushy""**

**Queenie: OH no no, nothing like that, its more like...uhh mom and dad don't wouldn't like him anymore.**

**Bonbon: Anymore? They meet him?**

**Queenie: Yes!** \*mumble\* **something like that.**

Huh, it's clear that Queenie and Sourface wanted to ""couple up"" but Artlad came into the picture.

**Me: hey I've meaning to ask you something.**

**Queenie: What is it?**

**Me: I don't understand you and Sourface's relationship. You said that you two aren't friends so what gives.** (I wanted more info and maybe see any cracks) 

**Bonbon: Well Queenie, I have been wondering myself. You seem to hang out with him a lot but you two don't even like each other.**

**Queenie: Reasons! At first I thought he was a cool guy but guess not.**

**Me: That doesn't rea-**

**Queenie: I SAID REASONS OK!**

**Me:** \*rising both hands in defense\* **Ok ok, I get it.**

I guess Queenie wants to hide that from everybody, but I'm wondering who else knows outside of Artlad, Goodfella and Cherry. I know Sourface told Artlad but did Artlad told Cherry? And if so, how many more or did just told her that they are cousin? I have more questions then answers.

**Bonbon: Does Sourface have a thing for you? It's seems that way, since you know it's clear you like Artlad and he might be not taking well. Not that he hide his feelings towards you.**

**Queenie: HUH? R-really you notice?**

**Me: Sourface's body language speaks volumes Queenie. Pretty sure the club took note too.**

If panic had a sound, Queenie would be making it. She's really trying to hide that they in fact are cousins. Cousins who have \*ahem\* part taken in the devil's tango. At this moment I was feeling off, like a mixture of unease, grossness and even guilt. Guilt because I was fucking with someone's life or at less the romance part of it. I however, I didn't stopped, instead I say:

**Me: Who cares if he does like you. He's creepy and you and Artlad look better together.**

**Bonbon: She's right Queenie. Sourface lost his chance with you anyway.**

**Queenie:** \*looking relieved\* **Yes you're right. I want a man like Artlad and NOT like Sourface. I'm way too good for Sourface anyway.**

**Bonbon: No duh Queenie! Artlad is a lucky guy!.**

**Me: So would you think about these traits?**

**Queenie: I would. Now leave! I have shit to do.**

Fucking wow! How rude, her ""shit to do"" ain't cleaning I guess but I did deserved it since you know, the plan I'm following. 

**Me: Wait? You live here too?**

**Bonbon: She's rooming with me until she finds a place so yeah leave and I'm not giving you a ride.**

**Me: Don't worry, Google maps is there for a reason just text me if you have questions Queenie.**

**Queenie: Yes yes I will now bye!**

She was shoo-ing me out, I didn't want to fight so I just left and it was fine by me because I DID NOT want to say in that glorified city dump any longer then I should. Turns out Bonbon lives near the train station I take everyday, so I started heading there and texted Goodfella.

**Me: hey Goodfella. Are you still busy with your bro?**

**Goodfella: No not anymore, Sourface left the place 30 mins ago. What about you?**

**Me: I gave Queenie the list and it seems she's into it. I think?**

**Goodfella: Give it time. Are you still there?**

**Me: Nah, just left. She's staying with a friend who lives near the train I take.**

**Goodfella: Cool. Want to meet up? I have new info on Sourface >:D**

**Me: I think I have new info too but I not sure we should meet up.**

**Goodfella: Why? I was thinking near where you live. Who else knows where you live?**

**Me: Only my other friend Bestbro since he's the only one with a car in our friend group right now.**

**Goodfella: Good, I promise I'll be quick. Plus I like hanging out with you. You seem fun.**

**Me: Hehe thanks but the only place I can think of is the little walking trail near the place I'm staying. If you don't mind.**

**Goodfella: I don't. send me the location?**

**Me: Sure.**

As I was waiting for my train and texting Goodfella, I get a text from Bestbro.

**Bestbro: Hey Dizzy, Got a minute to talk on the phone?**

**Me: Hey Bestbro, I have time but what is it you need to talk? Can texting be ok?**

**Bestbro: No. It's important. I can't find the words to type out. I need to talk out loud.**

**Me: Sure, but it has to be quick or you need like a lot time to talk?**

**Bestbro: Why? Does your family not like it or your time is limited?**

**Me: I'm meeting up with someone.**

**Bestbro: Well well, The Hermit is finally coming out of their shell. this is a first.**

**Me: It's just a friend dude. I can cancel if you need me.**

**Bestbro: Uh huh sure it's ""just s friend"". You can call me after ok.**

**Me: You sure?**

**Bestbro: No but I'm glad you're meeting new people, it actually ease me a bit. Don't worry. I'll be here when you're done.**

**Me: That's my line dude.**

I send the location to Goodfella and asking him if we could make this quick like he said and he said he'll be there soon. All could think of is why was Bestbro wanting a phone call. He never calls unless is something ""big"", I fear what he need to talk about. In the mean time, I headed to the little walking trail near my place. Really it's just a paved trail for bicyclist, joggers and people to walk their dogs, It's only 5 miles long. So I waited and I send Goodfella a text.

**Me: I'm heading towards the trail, meet you soon.**

**Goodfella: I'm on my way too.**

So I waited on the entrance of the trail for Goodfella to show up but can't stop thinking about Bestbro and the phone call. I'm a introvert by heart and I'm also socially awkward so phone calls are scary for me. My daze however stop when I here Goodfella call my name.

**Goodfella: Hey Dizzy. Sorry to sprung this now with short notice.**

**Me: Nah you're good. So what is this ""new"" info. There's some benches up this trail so we can talk.**

**Goodfella: We'll walk and talk as we go.**

We start walking and the trail wasn't crowded when got there since it was almost evening on a weekday.

**Goodfella: Sourface really ""lay it on me"". It was more like him making me give info on where Queenie is at and make me make her talk to him. He realized it was going no where. So he just left without another word.** 

**Me: That's the new info?**

**Goodfella: No dumbass, I'm leading up to that. Did you know Queenie and Sourface uhhhh ""linked up""**

**Me: What do you mean by ""linked up""? When I was talking to her she said she ""dump a guy she was seeing last semester"" and he became clingy. Her words not mine.**

**Goodfella:** \*shit-eating grin\* **Well she indirectly said she fucked Sourface and dump his ass for Artlad. You know the ""hot one""**

**Me:** \*literally gagging\* **OH GOD! I'm not shock but WHY ARE SMILING LIKE THAT! How are you not spraying the pavement with vomit!**

**Goodfella: Because they might still have feeling for each and make the plan easier.**

**Me: Well at less you weren't lying about the college fund. Queenie said she ""dumped"" him because she ""didn't want to hear about it"". Also something about her being smart and him wanting her to drop-out.**

**Goodfella:** \*bursts out laughing\* **HER?! BEING SMART?!**

**Me: what so funny about what I said?**

**Goodfella: She's in community college because she couldn't get a scholarship to a four year college due to her grades. I'm in community college because it's cheaper and my family isn't paying my way, only paying for books.**

**Me: I get that, but why be mean about it? Maybe she's going to our campus for the same reason. You know I going there because I just need a two-year degree right?**

**Goodfella: Look she acting she's studying some kind of science degree but she's really studying something easy.**

**Me: Like what? Do you even know? Dude your hatred for your brother and cousin is something else.**

**Goodfella: Try living with someone who's hellbent on fucking you over and the other using you as a scapegoat.** 

**Me: Ok ok, whatever.**

Then I asked how knowing how their ""relationship"" stands any good to the plan we already made. I was starting to think this getting stupid and I'm just digging myself into deeper in this mess. I just wanted some peace but thinking about that didn't ease thoughts on Bestbro and the phone call he's waiting for. But I push that on the back of my mind and try to focus on Goodfella for now. 

**Goodfella: I know it's nothing new but just something for us to have over them.** 

**Me: Dude, just because the ""break-up"" was a month ago doesn't mean this drama needs to be this big as it is.** 

**Goodfella: Like I said, both Sourface and Queenie love to drag other people to their mess. Sometimes I wonder they do it so they can say it's not their fault.** 

**Me: Dude, I've ""known"" them for a few weeks and it's clear that they don't take accountability.** 

**Goodfella: My point is that we can actually help Sourface be more like Artlad like for real this time.**

At this point I was feeling like we've been talking in circles and basically had a plan set in stone. There's no point of him coming over to my area. In hindsight, he was ""play"" or ""toying"" with me but that's a different tale not part of this one. With a long sigh I said:

**Me: Look Goodfella, I'm sorry that I made you come all this way but I don't think this ""new info"" changes the plan.** 

**Goodfella: I guess you're right, maybe I wanted an excuse to hang out with you.** 

**Me: Thanks but I have class work to do, I think we should ease up on this plan. I don't my grades slipping.** 

**Goodfella: Fair, fair. I'll head out home soon anyway but not before checking out your area. I saw some cool shops here.**

**Me: Cool, cool. I guess you see tomorrow at campus?**

**Goodfella: Well duh! See ya.**

We both parted ways, I waited until I was in my room to call Bestbro. I remembered he picked up quickly but don't really remembered word for word but kinda like:

**Me: Hey Bestbro, sorry for not calling sooner. What's this important thing you need to talk about?**

**Bestbro: Hi Dizzy, it's about Artlad.**

I was not ready to talk about him but my friend is hurting and could be Artlad's doing.

**Me: What about him?**

**Bestbro: Look I know he gave you some peace but I need someone to talk to and my girlfriend doesn't need this on her plate. You're only one at the moment.** 

**Me: Just let it out. I'm here for ya.**

**Bestbro: Dizzy, Artlad really feels like shit and he knows he royally fuck up. He's not himself right now, since telling me the truth I can't believed he was the one to hurt someone.** 

**Me: Look Bestbro, you need to stop cleaning up after Artlad every time he messes with girls.** 

**Bestbro: The worst part he feels that he needs to go back to that fatty club. I know every time he goes to that place he comes out more and more beaten up.**

**Me: How so?**

**Bestbro: Not only that girl who runs the club can't take no for an answer, it seems one of the guys of that fat-ass club is giving him a hurt time. Almost as if he has a thing for the girl. I don't know he's deal and Artlad won't say anything cuz he's trying to learn how not to reveal shit.** 

When Bestbro said that Artlad is leaning to keep his mouth shut, I wanted to yell. Now that everybody is pissed off at him and created this mess in the first place NOW he's making a change. Maybe it's because he revealed my past to the last person I want knowing and used it against me and maybe also told other people stuff that no one wants to be out there. Yeah, I felt it was a little too late. Trying to keep calm, key word being ""trying"" I spoked:

**Me: so you're telling me that after everything that happened, now he's ""working"" on it?**

**Bestbro: Dizzy I know you're mad, I'm mad as well. The reason I want to call you is because we had a argument.** 

**Me: You are not his brother, not his dad, not his anything! Why have an argument?**

**Bestbro:** \*anger starting to boil\* **Because I told him to stop fucking around and fix this like a fucking man! No more lies, no more cover-ups no more bullshit. He needs to learn how to be alone.** 

**Me: Did he really get mad from you telling the obvious? Bestbro, He even told me that ""not everybody is ok with being alone like you"" so what gives?**

**Bestbro: I think it has to do with the first girl he dated. Or maybe how his home life made him the way he is.** 

**Me: To tell you the truth, he never talked about his home life to me. But that doesn't change anything how he treated people just now.** 

**Bestbro: Wait he never told you? But so honest about it and sometimes won't shut-up about it or he talks a lot really.** 

**Me: I guess it never came up. Unlike him, I know that sometimes it's best not to ask for more. All I know is he's not very close to his family.** 

**Bestbro: I known him since we were kids. Both of our families know each as well. Want to meet up at that old coffee where we first hang-out? I'll tell you everything.**

**Me: Bestbro, you can't just giving someone's life's story just bec-**

**Bestbro: I don't care anymore, if he's willing to do that to you and then fuck 'em. So are you in or are you out?** 

I let out a heavy sigh and agreed to meet up and set up a time. I noted in my journal ""I was so worried for Bestbro and Artlad. I always envied their closeness and I wish I had a best friend like that. But now everything is falling apart and I feel like shit because I'm probably making things worst by following Goodfella. I starting to become someone I hate all because of something petty, something only high schoolers would do. The one thing I fear could be coming true is that I will lose friends over this.""



now all I could thing of is ""Is this worth it?""



Thank you for reading, I know it feels we're not even close to the end but trust me we are but I'm not revealing why, not yet. The next one is me talking to Sourface before meeting up with Bestbro. I hope you enjoyed your thanksgiving if you celebrate that holiday and drinks lots of fluids ~~not mountain dew~~ and I'll see you on the next one. DIZZY OUT!",1,1733121383.0,ReddXReads,0,1.0,False

One of the stops was at a town called Dong Van. It was obvious the tour company brought us here to kind of push us into buying drinks, which is fine, they gotta make money and if I'm gonna be a tourist here, I understand that comes with the territory. But what really creeped me out (and the two other guests on the tour) was that there were these Hmong girls who looked to be about 11 to 15 years old in traditional dresses doing a dance performance to modern music for a good hour and a half (we didn't stay for long, we were too uncomfortable). We all had trouble even looking at them lol. Two of them were smiling and seemed to be enjoying it, but I wonder if they were taught that this is normal and so being so young, they can't see how weird it actually is. The other 2 seemed to enjoy it less.

It felt like these girls were forced to do this. It felt exploitative. If they were adults it would've been OK, but they being so young with all these people filling the bar, most of them older people staring at them and filming them like they were zoo animals was just icky.

Am I overreacting about this? Is this normal in their culture, or is this purely something they were forced to do for tourists?",0,1733121299.0,VietNam,0,0.5,False

So, this ahole of highest degree - is such a miser and cheapo and selfish narissist.

So, he shares room with his brother but everytime his gf comes, he asks his brother to wait outside while he engages in sex with her and then when he is done, he asks him to get them some snacks or coffee.

Whenever, our maid comes, he orders her to cook for himself, what he wants to eat and never asks us like he would say, make 5 rotis and this sabji and this and does not care what others will eat or if they will like it. Then, if he is hungry, he can eat everything like everything and not care if others have eaten like paneer or ajy sabji. He cooks maggie and macaroni all day but when someone uses onions or tomatoes to cook smt for themselves, he makes faces.

He does not clear splitwise and does not order anuthing, he has an internship earning 20k but when I ask him to buy smt, he says, mere paas Zero ruppees hai account mai but roams whole Delhi with his gf, orders Biryani and all. This pisses me off most.

1h4otyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectricians/comments/1h4otyl/microwave_tripping_gfci/,Microwave tripping GFCI,"Of course, day before T-Bird day, microwave starts tripping the breaker.  The breaker (one half of a double 20A) has the fridge, the coffee maker, the toaster, the microwave, some master bedroom outlets, and the stove fan on it. Don't blame me, I didn't wire this. It all goes to a breaker on the battery backup panel, hooked up to my solar cell controller. 

SO... move the microwave to another circuit. Trips the breaker (20A) on the main panel. Got it, microwave shot to hell. Not a problem. Go to the Best store and get the same effective microwave 1.5 cubic inch 12 amp MW.  Plug it in, set up the time, put some water in a coffee cup in, hit 1 minute. All is OK. Do it again with another cup of water, trips GFCI. Now the old MW would trip the GFCI if I ran it at the same time as the toaster. So we never ran the toaster and MW at the same time.

Now, I run the MW, it randomly (like every other time) trips the GFCI. Does not trip the solar cell battery backup breaker. Does not take down the fridge. Does take down the fan unit and probably the coffee maker because the GFCI has tripped. Moved the MW to another circuit (which probably has no GFCI on it) and got through the weekend. Need to call my electrician. But would like to know why. Could the existing GFCI be weakened by it being tripped so many times or did I just get a crap MW unit? t",1,1733121229.0,AskElectricians,1,1.0,False

1h4osmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/1h4osmw/survival_cola_hunger_glitch_where_food_effects/,(Survival) cola / hunger glitch where food effects become permanent.,"Short version: **Caffeine makes you hungry.**  Having caffeine while a food buff is active might cause the buff to glitch.

Long version:

Radaway can be exploited to consistently trigger the glitch, as described here.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/92j60u/a\_fix\_for\_permanent\_food\_buff\_in\_survival/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/92j60u/a_fix_for_permanent_food_buff_in_survival/)

I've tested this, and it does go off consistently, and it stacks (vanilla Survival game).  The mechanism seems to be that Radaway changes your hunger levels, which makes the game ""forget"" that the buff came from food, so the buff never wears off.

\+++

The ""additional part"" of this post is that I sometimes) trigger the glitch without ever using Radaway.  I spend a lot of time playing a specific way (Survival + Permadeath + Chemist Perk), so I typically use Refreshing Beverage instead.

Hence my suspicion is that Cola is another way to trigger the food glitch.  Caffeine apparently changes hunger status.  This is not obvious in-game, but:

(1) the wiki ""Survival Mode"" page says: ""**caffeinated drinks have hunger increasing effects** as well as reduced thirst-quenching effects.""

(2) a loading screen tip says: ""in Survival, an items value is often a good way to determine how much hunger or thirst it might counter. Keep in mind, certain items may not give you the results you expect. For example, Chems and Alcohol dehydrate, **Caffeine makes you hungry**, etc.""

Sometimes, for big fights, I take a slew of aid items all at once (typically food, then chems, then cola, then a stimpack (if crippled), then Refreshing Beverage).  I assume it is the sequence (cola after food) that causes the glitch (just like having radaway after food).

This is partially guesswork because:

\- there is poor documentation about the glitch

\- there is poor documentation about which consumables cause hunger.

e.g. the wiki page for ""hunger"" has absolutely nothing about consumables causing hunger.  Ditto the wiki page for ""consumables"". The Nuka Cola page doesn't mention hunger either.

\- the game is super inconsistent about caffeine and aid effects.  Example: Buzz Bites, by ""lore"", are doughnuts filled with hot coffee.  However, by game mechanics, they are neither coffee nor food.

""Though they possess the keyword for both caffeinated and extra caffeinated, the game doesn't contain any code for applying it. Likewise, though they have the keyword to register as food, the lack of any value prevents it from reducing hunger.""",1,1733121084.0,fo4,1,0.67,False

1h4oqly,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1h4oqly/i_am_about_to_break_up/,I am about to break up. ,"My ‚Äúfriends‚Äù are not reliable and I wanted to not feel judged by them. That is, well, a discussion for some other time frankly. Today, my relationship is in a soup and I really would like help thinking through my situation and seeking your help. Why am I here? Because I have nowhere else to have this discussion and maybe some wise people here will be able to pour their hearts out, relate with me or some such which may stand a chance to help me think.

I‚Äôm 28F dating 35M (let‚Äôs call him Y) for the last 2.5 years now. The course of the relationship has been wonderful, with its own ups and down but nothing humongous to write home about. We all have that, right? 

About a month back, my ex-manager at work (let‚Äôs call her X) and so were hanging out after work and towards the end of our dinner, we for a change, exchange a lot of deep personal details about each other. I am also someone who doesn‚Äôt discuss personal life outside of the personal, you know what I mean? But for the first time I was able to share with her a lot more than usual. By the way, in a professional setting she has been a 50/10 manager. A rarity and I LOVE HER so much because of who she is. As we spoke, I also spoke to her about how my dating life is. In a bit, she was able to put things together and realised who my boyfriend is. To confirm before jumping to conclusions, she checked for his number, name, what he looks like everything. Jesus, the horror on her face after she confirmed was something I will never forget. 

For some context here, in my past relationships, women have been able to save me and disclose really horrendous things about the people I dated so the burning pit of my stomach right before these disclosures happen is not new for me at all. And it sucks you know. Really does because it is just horrible for it to keep happening again and again and again to me. 

She (X) ultimately told me that 3 months before my now boyfriend (Y) and I met and started dating, they had matched on a dating app and gone for one date. The date went decently but X felt that she didn‚Äôt think they aligned politically and messaged him with the utmost grace about why she can‚Äôt carry on. Trust me, I read it. Y seems to have gotten extremely pissed at that, he started off with historical and geographical notes of political alignment and what not and said it doesn‚Äôt make sense to him. As the conversation progressed, Y was extremely horrible to X to an extent where it felt like Y was not able to take a graceful no from someone. He hurled the nastiest swears at her one of them was ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a sorry child of your mother‚Äôs womb). The whole episode had left X in tears and while she also told me all this AFTER 2.8 YEARS it still felt like she was horrified by the man. I was embarrassed and just taken aback by the whole thing. 

Now, what is deeply upsetting is that my dear boyfriend, Y, had fully known that X was my manager for 1.5 years and I was really close to her. I would many times share group photos with him from work and speak of X very fondly to him. In this time, he didn‚Äôt even care to tell me about his fucking date with her and what really followed. It needed X to realise and then tell me and I‚Äôve since then only felt quite horrible about the whole thing. 

I had a prolonged fight with Y and shared my disappointment with him about the whole thing. When I confronted him, he completely denied it and lied initially and said that he didn‚Äôt know it was the same person but then came around to accept that he had known this for a year and didn‚Äôt think it was relevant for me to know. This is just one part right, he is not even a percent apologetic for his behaviour towards her. In his words ‚Äúshe was equally nasty with me‚Äù - which by the way is not true. I read the whole back and forth, none of it had deleted messages because the flow of the conversation was there. I have no reason to doubt her and why would I. Lol, my own boyfriend lied to me for the greater part of the relationship and still probably somewhere thinks that I blew the whole thing out of proportion. 

Of course, this also meant that I really sat and reflected about our entire relationship and it just turns out (not news to me but it is) that he after all doesn‚Äôt exactly talk about anything to me. The people he has dated before, how they made him feel, his life before he met me and just the barrage of things that I feel give you insights into how and why a person chooses to be a certain way. He thinks I should ask point blank questions - whatever I need to know but how do I ask if I don‚Äôt know what to ask, yo? It‚Äôs a bad excuse for being recluse and unwilling to open up with me. I know. It‚Äôs just one of the things I have realised after a while of seriously dating him and yes, it does lend to how he is with me overall too. His only saving grace is that he is a great listener but if I needed something like that, I would pay a therapist to sit and listen to me. You know?

What I needed your help in thinking through is, does one get over shit like this? Because I‚Äôm stuck to it and he‚Äôs resumed normalcy while I have basically thought about it every single day since it has happened. It‚Äôs now ‚Äúold news‚Äù for him. Should I even wait around to get over it? I feel like I‚Äôve been lied to, he clearly doesn‚Äôt talk to me and what not. Up until now, it felt like I could spend my life with him but this has just blown my mind to another level. 

Do you know he also asked X for a conciliatory fucking coffee after 15 days of being so nasty to her. Why are men so doomed as a category of people and walk around in their lives as if to never face consequences of their actions? I will never understand. 

Please be kind to me if you can? I‚Äôm here only because of the lack of a sound support around me.",1,1733120864.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1h4opoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MWMSPACES/comments/1h4opoj/enhance_small_spaces_creative_storage_solutions/,Enhance Small Spaces: Creative Storage Solutions with Interior Designers in Gurgaon,"https://preview.redd.it/yzlv8gwvod4e1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f21c48f6059fa2777bcdce851649a60d7015343

Designing a small space can be challenging, but with innovative storage solutions and smart planning, even the most compact spaces can feel expansive and functional. Collaborating with the best interior designers in Gurgaon ensures that your home is not only stylish but also optimized for everyday living. Here's how creative storage solutions can transform small spaces.

# 1. Built-In Furniture for Seamless Storage

Built-in furniture maximizes storage without compromising style.

* Install wall-to-wall shelving units that blend seamlessly with the room's design.
* Opt for built-in beds with hidden drawers underneath.
* Create niches in walls to hold decorative items or essentials.

# Tip from Retail Experts:

Take cues from [**retail store interior designers**](https://www.mwmspaces.com/) who use vertical space efficiently for storage while maintaining aesthetics.

# 2. Multi-Functional Furniture for Dual Use

Multi-functional furniture is perfect for small spaces as it combines form and functionality.

* Sofa beds can double as seating and sleeping areas.
* Coffee tables with hidden compartments are ideal for storing books or electronics.
* Foldable dining tables can expand when needed and shrink to save space.

# Design Insight:

The [**best interior design companies**](https://www.mwmspaces.com/) in Gurgaon offer custom solutions to create furniture tailored to your space and lifestyle.

# 3. Maximize Vertical Space with Smart Shelving

Vertical storage ensures that every inch of your home is utilized.

* Install floating shelves to display books, plants, or decor.
* Use tall cabinets to store items that are not frequently accessed.
* Add hanging storage options like hooks or pegboards in kitchens and closets.

# 4. Hidden Storage to Declutter Effortlessly

Hidden storage keeps the space tidy while accommodating belongings.

* Use beds with hydraulic lifts to store blankets or seasonal clothing.
* Invest in ottomans with storage for living room essentials.
* Create false walls or panels to conceal storage in unexpected places.

# 5. Use Mirrors to Expand Visual Space

While mirrors do not directly add storage, they create an illusion of a larger space.

* Install mirrored sliding doors on wardrobes.
* Use large wall mirrors in living rooms to reflect light and make the area appear bigger.

# Pro Tip:

Interior designers often combine mirror panels with storage units for a functional yet visually appealing solution.

# 6. Optimize Corners with Specialized Furniture

Corners are often overlooked but can be transformed into useful storage areas.

* Add L-shaped shelving or corner desks.
* Use corner sofas with storage underneath.
* Place corner cabinets for storing less-used items.

# Idea:

Retail store designs often utilize corner displays creatively‚Äîintegrating such ideas into your home can enhance space efficiency.

# 7. Sliding Doors to Save Space

Sliding doors take up less room compared to traditional swing doors.

* Install sliding wardrobes in bedrooms.
* Use sliding doors for cabinets in kitchens or storage units.
* Incorporate barn-style doors to partition rooms without occupying floor space.

# 8. Color and Lighting for Spacious Ambience

Storage isn‚Äôt just about physical solutions; colors and lighting play a big role in making a space feel organized and open.

* Use light colors for walls and furniture to create an airy feel.
* Install under-cabinet lighting to illuminate storage areas effectively.
* Opt for glass-fronted cabinets for a more open appearance.

It‚Äôs become a cleaning nightmare. I clean the common spaces upwards of three times a day (between work and going to college), and Jake is constantly making crazy messes. He never seems to keep food on his plate/in his mouth, and the kitchen always looks like a bomb went off after he‚Äôs been in there. I watch him take as much time and effort to do his dishes as I do, but when I find them after, they‚Äôre still caked in food. The same goes for wiping down surfaces, and picking garbage up. Last week I found leaves of spinach all over the floor, and he genuinely had no idea he‚Äôd left a trail behind him. 

Because of all this, I‚Äôve spent way more money this year on cleaning supplies, paper towels, and replacing items he‚Äôs ruined. This includes three rugs, a coffee table, and lots of dish towels that couldn‚Äôt be salvaged. I have occasionally asked him to split the costs of the paper towels/house supplies with me, but the big things he said he sees as my preference for decorating. Plus I SWEAR, he cannot tell that they‚Äôve been ruined. We‚Äôve had the conversation about putting more effort in, and he‚Äôs always receptive.

When Jake moves in the new year (new job in a different city), I‚Äôm going to need to buy a new couch. There are stains and smells that I simply can‚Äôt get out. I really want to ask him for some money towards this (not splitting, just some), but I don‚Äôt know how. 

I want to emphasize that Jake is a great guy and does actually try to clean. He‚Äôs just bad at it, and makes a mess bigger than a normal person to begin with. I don‚Äôt want to offend him by saying, ‚ÄúI need a new couch because you have dropped multiple bowls of cereal/pasta on it,‚Äù but this year has already cost me a lot from replacing my things. 

Any advice on how to bring this up nicely would be appreciated. Please don‚Äôt hate on Jake.",1,1733120638.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False

I have been away for some time now. I miss it! I miss the drive up to st Helen‚Äôs. I miss the two hr trip to the beach! I miss the sandwich deli/cafe that was in the corner across from the Merwin tap(is that still a place?) I miss red leaf! I miss Safeways chicken strips! I remember red leaf just being the small little coffee trailer in town. I also miss that one coffee place that sold energy drinks. Famous for the (hulk) drink. Overall I miss driving in the bottoms to just get your mind off of things. I remember when wal mart was like the biggest thing to happen to woodland and everyone would just go there just for the fun of it.

‚Ä¢	A powerful processor is a must‚Äîsomething that can handle multiple trading platforms, software, and tabs running simultaneously without lag. I‚Äôve heard good things about Intel Core i7 or i9 processors, or their AMD equivalents like the Ryzen 7 or 9. Any insights on which is better for this use case?
‚Ä¢	At least 16GB of RAM (maybe 32GB if necessary?). I want this laptop to be future-proof for at least a few years.

2.	Dual-Screen Functionality:
‚Ä¢	He‚Äôs expressed a desire for dual-screen laptops like the ASUS ZenBook Duo series, which have an additional screen above the keyboard. I think the extra screen space will help him monitor multiple charts, portfolios, and news feeds simultaneously. Are there other dual-screen options I should consider, or is the ZenBook Duo the best choice in this category?

3.	Graphics:
‚Ä¢	He‚Äôs not into gaming, so I don‚Äôt think we need a top-tier GPU. However, I‚Äôd still like decent graphics capability for smooth visuals, especially when dealing with chart-heavy crypto platforms.

4.	Portability:
‚Ä¢	He works from home most of the time but occasionally takes his laptop to coworking spaces or coffee shops. So, a balance between portability and screen size would be ideal‚Äînothing overly bulky.

5.	Storage:
‚Ä¢	Since he deals with crypto wallets, I assume a fast SSD is critical. Should I aim for 1TB storage, or would 512GB with external options suffice?

6.	Price Range:
‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm flexible but would prefer to stay under $3,000. If there‚Äôs something amazing slightly above that, I‚Äôm open to suggestions.",2,1733120293.0,CryptoCurrency,9,0.6,False
