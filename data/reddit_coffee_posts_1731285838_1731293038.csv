1gohy9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gohy9b/girl_im_interested_doesnt_seem_to_give_off/,Girl I’m interested doesn’t seem to give off romantic attraction. She’s moving towards me but I don’t think she likes me like that. Do I just go no contact? ,"I (21M) have interest in this girl at my college (19F) who I have known for about 8 months or so. We talk a little bit but we’re not like close friends or anything, though we have hung out a few times doing stuff like spontaneous coffee trips etc. 

Today we went to the mall, it wasn’t a date but more just casual two friends chilling. I would say we had a good time but there wasn’t really a “flirty” vibe between the two of us. I say she’s moving towards me because when I was talking to her about going to the mall she said something about how we need to go to Starbucks and try the Christmas coffee flavors sometime, so that’s a plus. 

I’m not getting the vibe she’s into me on a romantic level though. Plus, occasionally she will miss my messages, though she told me once that she saw my messages but she got sidetracked whilst replying. I’m not in love with her, but should I just go full no contact and just go on my winter arc, or is keeping her around an option so long as I realize it will never lead to anything serious? 

Im off to grad school in a year anyway. ",1,1731292780.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1gohwjx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gohwjx,Feeling like I’ve got the hang of it,"My last few loafs have finally started turning out good-looking after a couple months of mediocre bread. A couple of things that have felt like a breakthrough to me:
- Be relatively gentle with the dough and try to feel like you’re maintaining the fermentation bubbles when folding and shaping. Somethings that Joy Rides Coffee said that stuck with me was to feel like you’re stacking the alveoli on top of each other. Try to avoid de-gassing when scoring; something that can help is scoring after 5 minutes of bake time.
- Only one or two coil folds per set are necessary in my experience.

Recipe:
- 80% bread flour
- 15% whole wheat flour
- 5% rye flour
- 20% starter
- 2% salt

Autolyse 2 hours, 4 sets of coil folds over 5 hours, shape and rest in basket for another 2 hours, fridge for a day, bake in Dutch oven.",2,1731292628.0,Sourdough,1,1.0,False

1. The Stew Crew is becoming homogenized right before our very eyes. Their content is heavily curated these days and every event is used multiple times for promotion, links , stories and reels. By the time the weekly Vlog comes out… It’s all just a rerun of what content they have pushed out all week. Carlin lives for her mirror Sundays, where the whole family shows off their newest outfit and the camera trains in on Layla, who is a professional at throwing faces. She is at the top of her class at influencer elementary.  After mentioning last week that she and Whitney are never at their shop, this week Carlin shows up for one day and films a ton of content that the boutique rolls out all week. She really wants you to buy her $50 throw blankets and her $75 pants. We know they are not there every day because one of the salespeople mentions that the whole team is there today. There is no way she could be at the boutique every day because how would she possibly have time to film all of her content with Evan? This week they went to Gatlinburg to see the leaves, to Dollywood, to Disney on ice and a Tennessee football game.  While everyone else in the world was following the election, the Stewarts bypass it all and instead give us Evan selling cologne in their otherwise unused kitchen and film Layla in church. They don’t have to mention the election because we all already know how they voted. It’s just a shame that they won’t say it with their chest… They are not about to mess up a check.  It was Zade’s turn to clock in this week and he is fully exploited at his pediatrician check up. He is finally getting a two year check up because Carlin and Evan have a new pediatrician. They spend way too much time convincing us that he doesn’t need speech therapy only to tell us at the end that he is going to have a speech evaluation. The poor kid gets absolutely no privacy because they feature him riding the electric bicycle around town with Carlin and stick the camera in his face while he watches Disney on ice. No one knows what the hell he is saying except the two of them… And let’s be honest… Layla is about to turn five and she isn’t all that clear either.  While they are at Disney on ice celebrating Khloe‘s birthday, Evan says Carlin has never been to anything like this because she has to live her childhood through her children. Such a condescending ass… he says all of that to her, but he’s the one running around in Mickey Mouse ears screaming at the camera about how absolutely exciting this is. The lowest point of the week came when Carlin featured a reel of Layla eating/licking cotton candy and one just has to wonder… Who is she really making this content for? The Stewarts attend a football game with Josie and Kelton as invited guests of the University of Tennessee. I hope the University knows they would never attend that school or allow any of their children to go there… but go sports! Carlin is in a mini skirt and a T-shirt and someone comments that her outfit is hideous. Lots of folks think she is pregnant… But she was drinking a sugar-free monster at the game.  

2.  Josie Balka forgot that she is selling and promoting baby formula and featured a “get ready with me” for a Tennessee football game where she loads her breast pump up into her clear bag. Lydia and Trace go with them to the game and Lydia is in leggings and a T-shirt while Josie looks like she is ready for the club. We also get a “get ready with me” for church the next day where the girls’ hair is jerked into a ponytail and the rest is all Josie primping for the camera while Kelton and his apron are in the kitchen, smoking a pot of chili.  Kelton has to leave town on a work trip so he brings over all of the Balka cousins to watch over Josie while he is away. Josie loads them all up and heads to the mall, the nail salon and then it’s back home where she forces all of them Into pool noodles. She says this is a night with the girlies and someone needs to remind her that she’s a mom of three. She is obviously having an identity crisis where she doesn’t know if she is Brat or if she is Ballerina farm.  Josie also manages not to talk politics all week… And in her vapid, whispery world…the election never happened. Kelton makes it back to town just in time to head out to yet another Tennessee football game. This time the Balkas make it on the sidelines with the Stew crew. Kelton tries to act goofy like Evan, but it just lays flat. The Effortless shop continues to feature micro influencers in pool noodles. You have to wonder if in 2025 women are going to start making TikToks about their receding hairlines. A class action lawsuit could be in her future…

3. The Clark family must be feeling the burn of two under two because things were relatively quiet this week with no new Vlog. They pretended an election was not happening and instead made a reel of a family painting project. Katie showed off a $75 dress from the Bates Sisters boutique and paired it with boots she said were a gift fromCarlin. Turns out they were from Shein… Gee, thanks sis.  Katie is promoting the weighted sleep sack and is putting her newborn in one, even though they are not pediatrician recommended.  Between that and being strapped into his rotating bassinet… all Harvey CAN do is sleep! Katie and Travis venture out to Dollywood with Katie wearing baby Harvey. Someone must think she should be at home because they spend a lot of time explaining why it is OK for them to be there. Guess what Katie, it’s also OK for you to stay at home with your newborn and rest and heal …. Let your husband come up with some content since this is what HE wants to do. 

4.  Big, exciting things are happening in WebsterLand… Alyssa takes her children to a coffee shop and allows them to spend their money and order their own drinks. Unfortunately two girls have to share one small drink. Mom, of course, gets her very own jumbo coffee. They take their liquid sugar to the deserted park so Alyssa can film Rhett frowning while sliding down a slide and tell us all how fun it is. Allie seems to be in charge of Rhett in the car and at the park. Over on her business page, she has lost over 100 followers. She puts the sad hats on sale for 30% off and exactly one adult hat is either sold or… maybe John needed a new one.  We see Jeremiah Duggar, and his wife and kids in the hats, but surprisingly, that does not cause a rush of sales.  Back at home Alyssa locks herself in the baby’s room with Rhett to sell pajamas. You can tell she is forcing herself to sound happy and excited and loud. Rhett tries to lock himself in his closet. He’s terrified of fake happy mom or either he saw the filter that she is putting on his face.  Alyssa does not shy away from the election and shows the whole family at Taliban Dan’s reelection party. The next day she says it is a very good day. Coincidentally, that also does not cause a rush of sales in her sad hat store. For her 30th birthday, Allie is allowed to bake her a cake and the girls decorate the table and make her a card where Lexi calls her “mother”. Very Joan Crawford-like Lexi! John is totally absent from her Vlog and her social media in general, but we do see that he took her out for the night with a bunch of super young couples from their church. Alyssa says she is going to answer 30 questions for her 30th birthday however, if she does not like the question she won’t answer it no kidding, tell us something we don’t know. One of her girlfriends comes over to read her the questions and Alyssa sits alone with her coffee and answers them expressionless. She says at the beginning that she plans to be as vague as possible and I don’t think she knows what vague means… Or maybe she does. In any case, we find out that she and John have been talking about baby number six… She says that after taking all of her children out to dinner, she changed her mind. I’m left wondering again… What is going on with these kids when they are in public? Other notable things she says… She does not listen to online criticism…which we know, because if she did, she would lay off the cartoon filters. She is only interested in her kids going to college if they have some idea of what they want to be when they grow up. This is such a ridiculous thing to say because college is where you go to figure that out. Alyssa tells us that she does not get along with all 18of her siblings, and once again mentions that people grow up and get married and change. I wonder which in law she can’t stand?? She does say she is planning a trip to Tennessee at Christmas time…maybe.  I had to chuckle when she totally downplayed CheerfullyU and said she has no plans to feature any other products and it was always just a hobby and just something to do on the side…. like so much with Alyssa…the story just doesn’t add up.  She only gets birthday wishes from KellyJoe, Carlin and Esther.

5.  Erin Paine is back to save your life with clean eating. This week she has set up shop in what appears to be a new filming location. She is a one woman show with a cafeteria table, and a blender with no lid. Baby Finney is there to suck on strawberries and fling hair around while Erin makes a smoothie. She puts nothing fun in the smoothie, serves it to her children one at a time while pestering them to tell her what it tastes like. I am pretty sure Brookie said it tastes like poop… But Erin dubbed the video so it sounded like blueberry instead.

6. Whitney Bates showed up at her boutique to film content with Carlin and then headed out to celebrate Khloe‘s fifth birthday.  She takes her older kids to Disney on ice with Carlin and Evan. Zach was obviously busy… Evan never is.  In the Bates kitchen this week…No one is cooking. Instead, Zach answers questions with Kelly Joe. This is her fourth appearance on the show and I have to wonder if she is going to be his new cohost. Zach talks a lot and Kelly Joe fights to get a word in edgewise. We find out that when they landed the show… They ate out a lot, and now that they don’t have the show anymore… they cook at home. They talk a lot about other people’s cooking but they don’t show any pictures so it’s just two people on barstools talking. Gil Bates will turn 60 sometime during the holidays, and they are planning a huge Christmas/New Year’s/birthday celebration where they hope the entire family will be together. This is obviously the trip Alyssa is thinking about making. Zach tells us that there are more grandbabies to come because he gets notifications on his phone with news that is not yet public. Kelly Joe looks thrilled. The only thing she likes more than macaroni and cheese is a new pregnancy.

7. Michael and Brandon have Tori’s daughters over to exploit this week. The little girls paint animal figurines while smiling at Brandon behind the camera and that’s it… That’s all there is …just two little girls painting.

8. Trace Bates left his wife and child for eight days to go on a Colorado hunting expedition. Only…Trace is not hunting on this trip… So basically he ran away. While he is gone, Lydia drops Ryker off with her parents for a few days… She says it so she can get her work done and because they haven’t seen him in so long. I guess the 10 days they were gone three weeks ago doesn’t count.  Lydia is left to promote their Vlog sponsor all on her own. It is those pukey frozen microwave meals, and it looks exactly the same frozen or cooked… Gray and gross. Lydia doesn’t even pretend to eat it. She takes Ryker to the zoo and hangs out with her parents. Trace shows nothing of Colorado except his mug in front of the camera. I guess he made it back home and went to Spain with medicCorp. He was promoting their fundraising on the medicCorp page from Spain.

9. While pretty much every other Bates shied away from election coverage… Tiffy and Lawson decided to jump in head first. I refuse to report on the dangerous rhetoric and absolute idiocy that these two spewed all week. She tried to rebound by asking-once again-who her baby looks like and reminding everyone that she’s adopted… But I think for a lot of folks it was too late. Lawson got reminded over and over again in the comments about his little January 6 trip and he can do performative rescues with medicCorp for the rest of his days and people are not going to forget. When someone shows you who they are… Believe them.

10. Bits and Bytes…Renee’s Bridal is suddenly all over the Bates’ social media. She loves everything they do/post…Kelly Joe continues to evolve into a full on influencer. This week she had IG stories and grid  posts about entertaining Patch the Pirate’s Wife at Bible Baptist Church. Patch is dead, but they still had a birthday cake for him…. BSB posted a proverb about kind words being honey for your heart…no one has featured the God garage lately. The workouts seem to have slowed down.

Have a great week friends. Hell… it can’t get any worse… can it??? (Don’t answer that)

1gohvev,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepypastastories/comments/1gohvev/the_clown/,The Clown,"The following posts were originally found on a popular website forum and have since been removed.

*OP (06-17-21)*: Several months ago, I lost my husband after he apparently died in his sleep. I wish I could say he looked to be at peace when he died, but the look of terror on his face when I found his body would suggest otherwise.

Now, I'm no doctor and I haven't seen many dead bodies, so I assumed his ghastly expression was a normal occurrence. Something related to the muscle fibers expending their last ATP stores to cause one last final muscle contraction, a final abnormal neurological firing resulting in an odd last facial expression… but now I'm starting to think there might have been another, more ominous reason.

After months of mourning his loss, I decided it was finally time to start going through my husband’s things. To get a sense of closure. To move on with my life. Maybe even try and meet someone new. 

While going through his bedside dresser, I found a diary. He was a writer, albeit not a very good one, and I'm told this is a normal thing that writers to do. Sometimes he would have vivid dreams and would have to jot them down before they slipped his mind.

I'll relay his entries here as they're written in his diary. Knowing who he was and what he believed, I know that this is what he would have wanted; he would have wanted me to share his musings with the world, even if they fell on deaf ears. But before you read any further, there is one slight caveat I should mention. He had hundreds of entries in his diary and I read through all of them. Maybe to get a better sense of who he was, maybe because I was bored, or maybe because I just wanted to hear his voice again and reading his words allowed me to hear them. To hear him.

Regardless, most of the entries are rather mundane, lacking in inspiration or originality, but towards the end his dreams started to become more linear, almost like a TV series, with a clear protagonist and antagonist. A beginning, a middle, and an end. I’ll start relaying his entries at the beginning, or at least what I believe to be the beginning.

*Entry 1*: I'm sitting in the bleachers of my high school basketball gym. It's exactly how I remember. There are 2 sets of bleachers on each side of the court, one on the lower level and one on the upper level; I'm on the upper level. The dance team is doing some kind of performance, but I'm not really paying attention because my high school crush – we’ll call her Angelica to protect her identity and because she was like an angle to me - is sitting directly across from me; we keep making eye contact.

*OP*: I didn't know he had a crush on anyone in high school, but I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.

*Entry 1 (continued)*: The dance team is finally done with their performance. I'm now standing by myself in the middle of the basketball court. The spotlight is on me. Shit. I'm still in my underwear. The entire audience is laughing at me. I turn to run, but I'm now in the middle of our football field. It's our high school graduation.

*Entry 2*: I'm back in the middle of the football field, but now I have pants on (thank God) along with my cap and gown. Our entire graduating class is sitting in plastic foldable chairs, all neatly laid out in the middle of the football field. Why did they make us sit out here for our graduation in the middle of summer? Anyway, the valedictorian is in the middle of a commencement speech. 

And now the valedictorian – initially an archetypal Poindexter, complete with braces, glasses, freckles and a pocket protector – has transformed into Angelica because of course that would happen. I can't stop staring into her eyes and I barely process what she’s saying. Why can't I stop staring? Does she wear contacts or are her eyes really that captivating?

Angelica stops in middle of her speech and fiddles with the microphone. There doesn't seem to be any sound coming from it. I never hear anything in my dreams anyway, so it's kind of weird seeing someone else in a dream react to not being able to hear themselves.

Suddenly, someone appears next to the podium where she's standing. I recognize everyone else in my dream except for this strange interloper. He leans over and whispers something to her. She nods to the mysterious guest and makes her way to her seat, which, you guessed it, is right next to me. Does that mean anything? It has to mean *something.*

The moment she sits down, the strange interloper picks up the podium and hurls it into the sky. Everyone, including me, looks up. When I look back down, the strange interloper has transformed from a pedestrian middle-aged man into a clown, complete with red curly hair, an unnerving smile and large sharp pointed teeth. I think he had eyes, but I don't remember what they looked like. Small red dots that pierce through the darkness? Or maybe they were large, yellow and lifeless… eyes the size of dinner plates that couldn’t possibly belong to anything in this reality? I’ll be sure to look more closely next time, if I have the wherewithal to remember.

Then, one of the school administrators took it upon herself to confront the clown and shoo him off the stage. As she approached, the clown’s gaze slowly shifted from the audience to the administrator. The clown’s intense gaze quickly melted her confident demeanor and she suddenly had a change of heart. Like a dog with their tail tucked between their legs, she slowly started to back away from the clown. She must have thought she was safe because she turned her back on him. Big mistake. He quickly closed the distance between them, picked her up, unhinged his jaw, and devoured her whole. I was completely speechless. And then I remembered I was in a dream.

When I woke up, I was drenched in sweat. I watched a scary movie about clowns last night, so that's probably what this clown thing is all about. To the light of my life, if you're reading this, that's why I washed the sheets. Not because I was actually trying to “be a better husband”, though I really do try.

*Entry 3*: I'm back on the football field and the clown just finished engulfing the administrator. He jumps down from the stage and begins devouring everyone in the front row, one by one. I stand up to get a better view. I can barely make out a pair of feet squirming before they disappear into the clown's grotesque mouth. I sit back down and turn to Angelica, who's still sitting next to me. She doesn't seem to be bothered at all by the atrocities happening before our eyes. In fact, no one seems bothered by the clown until they realize they’re next.

When I wake up, I'm not drenched in sweat, but my hands are sore. I think I had a death grip on my blankets while I was sleeping. I wonder how long my hands were stuck like that? I've never had nightmares of the same movie back-to-back and I've certainly never had such a visceral experience during my dreams, let alone dreams that happen in a linear fashion. How far can I take these dreams? Could these dreams be telling me something? Are they the gateway to the story that's going to make me famous? 

*Entry 4*: I'm back on the football field. The clown has finished devouring everyone in the front row, though he certainly doesn't look like he's eaten anyone because his funny little checkered vest still fits and his bow tie is still miraculously secured around his neck. I begin counting the rows between him and me.

21.

21 rows between him and me. I let out a sigh of relief.

It seems the clown heard me because once I finished sighing, he looked directly at me. Up until this point, we hadn't actually made eye contact. What’s particularly strange is that I still don’t know what his eyes looked like, despite making a conscious effort to note their appearance. Maybe there was nothing where his eyes should have been and my mind is just trying to fill in the blanks. What I did notice is that the clown’s motivation seemed to change. At first, it seemed he was causally killing the audience members, almost as if he was tasked with killing these people and was reluctant to do so – like he drew the short straw and was in charge of cleanup on aisle 4. Now it seems like he’s trying to dispose of them quickly so he can get to me faster – rushing through the entrée so he can get to desert.

I say that because after the clown looked at me, he looked at the rows between him and me, bounced a few times in his massive red shoes, and then jumped 15 feet into the air. While suspended in mid-air, he began breathing fire at the rows in front of me. Rows 2-15 were suddenly filled with nothing but charred bodies and melted chairs.

When I woke, I could have sworn I smelled burning flesh and heard the muffled sound of people screaming. The smell lasted for only moments and the sound of screaming, even less so.

*Entry 5*: I’ve only slept twice over the past four days. That’s two more dreams. Two more rows of people dead. Two fewer rows between me and that clown, or that demon, or whatever it is.

I fear falling asleep because every time I fall asleep, another row of people dies, each time more brutally than the last. I’m beginning to fear that these aren’t just dreams after all.

*Entry 7*: I don’t know how long I’ve gone without sleep. I’m trying to hold it all together and pretend like everything is fine because no one would believe me if I told them the truth. If I told them what was really happening to me.

In the last dream I had, I tried to escape. But at the end of the aisle where I’m sitting, there is a red velvet rope that acts like a force field and I can’t go past it. There’s another red velvet rope on the other side of the aisle and I can’t go past that one either. I tried jumping over my seat, but I immediately woke up. I dare not try that again because the clown is now undoubtedly at Row 19, waiting for me to drift off to sleep.

*Entry 8*: This time, my dream was different. I was still at my graduation and the rows of dead bodies were still there, but this time the clown spoke. I actually *heard* the clown speak! In a guttural voice that shook my innards, the clown said, “You can’t stay awake forever.” He then raised his right hand and decapitated everyone in row 19 with one swift movement, looking me dead in the eyes as he killed them.

I woke up in tears. This can’t be happening to me. This can’t be real. Is this some kind of prank? Am I in some kind of weird psychological experiment?

*Entry 9*: I can’t believe I fell asleep again. Row 20 is dead. My row is next. I fear that if I fall asleep again, I may never wake up.

*Entry 10*: I made it 5 days on a combination of coffee and energy drinks before my body finally crashed. I thought for sure that would be the end of me. Instead, all the clown did was calmly walk to the beginning of my aisle, lift the red velvet rope and then lower it behind him. Just before I woke up, he turned and smiled at me. What a hideous and twisted smile!

*Entry 11*: The clown slowly made his way through everyone between me and the end of the aisle. Angelica, just after realizing she was next, turned towards me and started to run but it was useless. He swiftly put his hand through her back and pulled out her pulsating heart. I watched as the life slowly drained from her eyes and the thud of her body hitting the ground woke me from my sleep. The smell of her blood, that all-too-familiar smell of metallic copper, permeated my nostrils for an entire day.

*OP (06-18-21)*: That was the last entry in his diary. I know what you’re all thinking, “How could you not have noticed something was off?” I did notice something was slightly off just before he passed, but I didn’t think much of it. He was bound to some fits of insomnia. Sometimes he “did his best writing” when he couldn’t sleep. He was also prone to consuming a lot of caffeine. A LOT of caffeine. He said it helped “free his mind and be more creative” or something like that. I don’t know if this diary is real or if it’s just some prank that he set up in the event he died young. He had kind of a weird sense of humor… Has anyone experienced anything like this before?

*OP (06-19-21)*: I just had a dream that I was at my high school graduation. We were in the middle of a football field and the valedictorian was giving a speech. If anyone has experienced anything like this, please share!

1gohtu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HempLovers/comments/1gohtu7/a_beginners_guide_to_hempderived_edibles/,A Beginner’s Guide to Hemp-Derived Edibles,"Hemp-derived edibles are becoming an increasingly popular choice for people looking to experience the benefits of cannabinoids in a smoke-free and convenient way. From gummies to chocolates to beverages, there’s something for everyone. If you’re new to hemp-derived edibles or just curious about how they work, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know.



**What Are Hemp-Derived Edibles?**



Hemp-derived edibles are food products infused with cannabinoids like CBD (cannabidiol), THCA, or other non-psychoactive compounds extracted from hemp. These products are made from hemp plants, which contain less than 0.3% THC, making them legal under federal law in the U.S. (check your local regulations for specifics).



Edibles come in a variety of forms:

• Gummies (a fan favorite for their flavor and ease of use)

• Chocolates and baked goods

• Beverages like teas, sodas, or coffee

• Capsules and powders



**Benefits of Hemp Edibles**



Hemp edibles offer several advantages over other consumption methods:

1. **Smoke-Free Experience**: Ideal for people who prefer to avoid smoking or vaping.

2. **Long-Lasting Effects**: While it takes longer to feel the effects, edibles typically provide a longer-lasting experience compared to inhaled methods.

3. **Discretion**: Edibles look like any other snack, making them a convenient and subtle way to consume cannabinoids.

4. **Precise Dosing**: Most edibles are pre-portioned, so you know exactly how much you’re consuming.



**How Do Edibles Work?**



When you consume hemp-derived edibles, the cannabinoids are processed through your digestive system before entering your bloodstream. This process takes longer compared to smoking or vaping, so you may not feel the effects immediately.



**Key Points to Remember:**

• **Onset Time**: Edibles can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours to kick in. Be patient!

• **Duration**: The effects can last 4 to 8 hours, depending on your metabolism, dosage, and tolerance.

• **Dosing**: Start low and go slow. If you’re new, 5-10 mg of CBD or hemp-derived cannabinoids is a good starting point.



**Choosing the Right Edible**



Not all edibles are created equal. Here are a few tips to help you pick the right one:

1. **Check the Label**: Look for third-party lab testing to ensure quality and transparency.

2. **Understand Cannabinoids**: Some edibles focus on CBD for relaxation, while others may include THCA for additional benefits.

3. **Read the Ingredients**: If you have dietary restrictions, check for vegan, gluten-free, or allergen-friendly options.

4. **Flavor Preferences**: Gummies and chocolates often mask the earthy taste of hemp, making them popular for beginners.



**Tips for First-Time Users**



1. **Start Small**: Begin with a low dose, especially if you’re new to edibles. Wait at least 2 hours before deciding to take more.

2. **Be Patient**: Edibles take time to work. Avoid the mistake of consuming too much because you don’t feel immediate effects.

3. **Choose the Right Setting**: Make sure you’re in a comfortable and relaxed environment, especially if you’re trying edibles for the first time.

4. **Stay Hydrated**: Drinking water can help enhance your overall experience and prevent dry mouth.



**Common Myths About Edibles**



• **“You’ll feel effects instantly.”** Unlike smoking or vaping, edibles require digestion, so patience is key.

• **“Edibles are always mild.”** Potency can vary, so even a small amount can pack a punch, depending on the product.

• **“All edibles are the same.”** Different products use different cannabinoids and extraction methods, leading to unique effects.



**Popular Edibles to Try**



If you’re looking to explore hemp-derived edibles, here are a few common options to consider:

• **CBD Gummies**: Great for relaxation and sleep.

• **Hemp-infused drinks**: A refreshing way to consume cannabinoids.

• **Hemp Chocolates**: Perfect for those with a sweet tooth.

• **Capsules**: A no-fuss option for consistent dosing.

I've watched almost every Lance Hendrik and James Hoffman video on YouTube (and many others) and spent hours every day on Reddit. I've purchased everything the Internet told me to purchase, such as:

1. Breville Bambino

1gohpkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TargetedSolutions/comments/1gohpkt/time/,Time, I haven’t posted for a whiles. For me setting around bitching and  moaning tripping on this situation I find myself in doing nothing  was very consuming. It consumed my emotionally physically and mentally. I found myself falling into the poor victim role. This is not good. The feeling of helplessness is a death sentence in so many ways.  I’ve always been a worker. Working is the number one way I fight my situation. So this is what I did.  I went to the round about where I live by Walmart and flew a sign. This is what my sign said. “Will work for cash no handouts”. I turned a lot money away the first day but at the end of the day I accepted twenty dollars bought  some coffee and smokes. The following day same thing but i did find a days worth of work. Oboy paid me twice on what we agreed then I got a call from a guy that does remodeling and I’ve been working for him ever since.  The best part of it all I’m allowed to stay in the house we’re remodeling. This is huge for me for I was homeless. Flying that sign like I did was the most humbling experience of my life.  I’m like many others trying to work in a corporate setting does not work. If i even get the job the organized harassment is to much to bare for I loose control of my emotions and it always would beat me down spiritually. I had to think outside the box to have the feeling I was at-least moving forward making the effort to move forward. I no longer allow myself to trip on right and wrong who’s worse of a person me or them how wrong everyone is about me I refuse to just set still and do nothing. There’s many of us that want to work need to work but don’t because of fear of the gauntlet we face in a work setting. So think outside the box. Go fly a sign looking for work. If it’s just a day or two weeks it don’t matter. Who knows who God may bring into your life that any bless you. Things are going pretty good right now beyond any hope I had and yes I’m always waiting for the sucker punch. If and when it happens it won’t be no surprise. It took them a few days but they now have their dew devices in one of the neighbors houses taunting me.  This is fine so what it’s all they have. Guess as long as they feel like they are getting in their punch’s and I’m feeling like I’m getting in my punch’s it’s all good. Don’t give up my brothers and sisters. We must fight but we have to fight right. ,1,1731292016.0,TargetedSolutions,0,1.0,False

1gohh1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalFistula/comments/1gohh1a/how_i_am_healing/,How I am Healing...,"Hi everyone, I wanted to come here to share my anal/perianal fistula healing. I started with a little pain in my behind area when I would wipe, it quickly turned into a pretty large abscess that needed to be drained. The doctor numbed it, cut it open and drained it. He was very kind and did it gently, no pain during the drainage or even afterwards during the healing. So long story short, it came back months later. I researched online and had seen a Dr in Sri Lanka was curing people with Homeopathy regimen. I decided to try it since I felt I wouldn't lose anything if I tried. (I am not a doctor, I am merely trying to help anyone who has felt what I did with this condition.) I only did the Arnica, Silicea and Simply Neosporin (applied after every bowel movement) and also followed the diet restrictions! very important!

This is the regimen in his words (Dr. Joe De Livera)

Arnica 30c in the Wet dose a capful of the bottle taken thrice daily to increase the flow of blood in the body which in turn will help to rebuild the tissue.  
Silicea 6x Dose 2 tablets taken twice daily to expel the pus from the lesion.  
Nat Phos 6x Dose 2 tablets taken twice daily after meals to soften the stools.  
Ferr Phos 6x Dose 2 tablets taken twice daily to improve the quality of the blood to help heal the lesion.  
Antibiotic Ointment like Polyfax or equivalent which is used internally on the tip of a gloved finger inserted into the anus after every bowel movement to keep the bacterial count as low as possible in the lesion.

Do not use toilet paper after a BM. Use a Hand Spray device instead available at Wal Mart which is a DIY fitting. (I used wipes to wipe and then I would shower and clean up before doing the Simply Neosporin)  
No Alcohol, Red meat, Coffee and Sausages, Ham and Bacon as they are loaded with Saltpeter. (He means Nitrites and Nitrates.)  No canned beverages like Coke. Do not eat hot (Chillie hot) food if you live in India. (THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT! It made a huge difference for me, basically no spicy food AT ALL)  
Drink at least 3 ltrs water daily and exercise moderately.

STOP ALL DRUGS YOU ARE TAKING TODAY. (I am a diabetic, so I did not stop taking my metformin.)

The Wet dose of any Homeopathic remedy is made as follows:

Order the remedy in a 5ml bottle in the Liquid Dilution in Alcohol. (I could not find the alcohol version only the globules from Boiron)   
Get a 500ml bottle of Spring Water from the nearest supermarket. (I put 3 Arnica globules in a 16 ounce water bottle, dissolved them and took a capful 3 times a day.)  
Pour out about 3cm of water from the bottle to leave some airspace.  
Insert 3 drops of the remedy into the bottle and shake it hard to produce bubbles. This is homeopathic succussion and must be done every time before a capful of the bottle which is the dose is taken as directed.

Do not use Coffee, Cola beverages, preserved foods like sausages, ham and bacon as they contain Saltpeter.

I got my first smart doll in 2019/2020 and I remember very clearly how he said that he is discontinuing „milk” because nobody is actually „that pale” which is obviously bullshit because there are many people who are extremely pale and it’s not that uncommon. Anyway I find it so annoying that he first trashed one skin color then he was releasing only dark skinned girls and he was talking down on his own clients when many people were unhappy with this decision. (Ofc if someone had a problem with a darker doll in general then that’s definitely not okay but people just wanted all skin colors available not just one and he basically treated everyone like racists) and now he’s sooooo „inclusive” bcs he added another darker skin tone very similar to cocoa. I think it’s great that dolls can come in all different shades don’t get me wrong but discontinuing one shade and adding another one is not inclusive lmao. Also I hate how he thinks he is better than all the other Japanese people so open minded🥴. I have two beautiful smart dolls but honestly I can’t support this company anymore the owner is a hypocrite. Like imagine a makeup company removing one shade bcs nobody is so „pale/dark” and then going on about how they’re inclusive and care about the customers… No thanks. ,1,1731291006.0,smartdoll,4,0.56,False

Yet, over the past 6 months doing pretty much whatever I felt would help me meet people. It just hasn’t led to anything with anyone. My old friends have also started to fade from my life which has made all of this harder for me. A lot of my conversations with people irl or online have been: 
Me: Hello! 😸
Them: 😕
Me: hOw, ArE, U? 
Them: 💀
Me: good talk 🫡🗣️

It’s weird. I feel like I have a ton of interests such as video games, skateboarding, horror movies, sports, music, traveling, history, etc. In that sense, I have come a long ways from who I once was in high school. Aka, Mr.One Dimensional who’s only interests consisted of games and literature. I’ve also become someone who’s pretty willing to put himself out there.

Female (Zoe)  and male (Pete).
Zoe is usually the person who serves me makes my drink, she knows me well and I dont need to tell her my order. 
As I am a regular we have gotten to know each other a little over time. She knows where I live, due to seeing my car outside my house, small town.

Two weeks ago I was walking my dog to Coles, on the way I stopped and got a coffee, I drank it on the way, and it was not nice, it tasted very sour so I ditched it. On the way home I decided to get another one. Zoe had gone home and Pete served me and made my coffee.

While he was making the coffee we were chatting and I mentioned I didn't enjoy the last drink, I wasn't complaining, just kinda asking why sometimes it tastes sour like that. I don't really remember the conversation but when he finished and I went to pay he told me not to because of my last drink.

I didn't go back for a free coffee and I had no intentions by it. Sometimes I give feedback, like I would if it was delicious. I didn't think more of it and went home.

Two days ago I went back to get another coffee and it was just Zoe working. 
While she was making my drink she said, ""I have a bone to pick with you,"".
I was a little taken aback, and then she said  she brought up the week before and said, ""you know that was a real shit c+&t move you did there. You took a big gulp right Infront of us.

Now I probably did take a sip, but I can't always gauge it on the first sip, unless it's absolutely amazing, and sometimes the first sip is mostly chocolate from the sprinkles.

I didn't say anything, it was just us and I just froze, I said, why did it taste sour, she said.. ""idk, why did it? 

I turned around and there was a customer waiting, I paid and left. 

Half way through her talk she said, ""I'm only telling you this because I know you won't be offended"". She was very wrong, I am so offended 

I got into my car and cried, I didn't sleep that night or much the next. I have never felt so humiliated in my life. I didn't like to be accused of lying.

I want to mention it to Pete or the boss but I am not sure what I can do or what I should do. She knows where I live, she's told me before that she has BDP, and that worries me a little. Over the time I have known her she has said some nasty things about people. That morning before she ""picked her bone with me' she told me she was happy because she just made her bitch co worker quit finally..

I met her through hinge over a month ago. I've never had luck on any dating sites, not until she commented on my hinge profile and it felt like we really hit it off. We tested every night for hours, usually her starting the convo. We met up a few days later for coffee and it went insanely well, not a single second of silence, all smiles and everything. As soon as I left, 15 min later she texted me how much fun she had and wanted a second date. Because of scheduling it was over 2 weeks later when we had a second date, but the entire time we were still texting each other for hours every day. She got some bad news from her family during the date and the date was called off a little early. After that, I didn't hear much from her. After a few days I thought I was ghosted and asked what happened, she said some stuff happened and she didmt have time for dating. That was basically where we stopped talking. I told her that I liked her and thought of her but she said it wouldn't be for a while until she was ready. And that's basically it, we haven't talked since, over a week. I can't stop thinking about her. I know it's stupid, I barely know her and we haven't known each for that long, but I just like we really connected. I've onky dated a few people before her, but no one has made me feel like this, and ever since we basically went our separate ways, ive been in a lot of pain. What should I do? If nothing else, how long until I stop thinking about her, or how can I get work on getting over her? I know it's stupid. I mean I'd only known her a month, but I felt a real connection and I really liked her and how this whole thing ended, it felt empty, like this relationship was pulled away from me. I really liked her, now I don't know what to do. Please, any advice would be appreciated.

TL;DR: Close friend moved out due to argument with *other* close friend (both also my roommates). I was never apart of the drama. I miss him, but he can also be a “not so great person”. But at the end of the day, a 10 year friendship is basically ending in a gradual ghosting. 

Haven’t posted in this sub before (I don’t think) but yeah. For context: He’s no longer my roommate and we’ve known each other for roughly 10-11 years. 

He moved out on “not so great terms”. I was never apart of the drama that ended everything, but nonetheless was put in the middle of an argument between him and my other roommate (who’s also a close friend). This is pretty much a byproduct of said argument: 

Him and I personally did not end on bad terms. We weren’t the ones arguing. Yet, nearly 2 months later and we haven’t talked. Haven’t texted. It’s been radio silent, despite my efforts to keep a friendship with him going. Trust me, I’m getting the hint. But it fucking hurts. I don’t understand how someone can go from being in your life *basically everyday for a decade* and essentially overnight - they’re gone. Emotionally detached from you. Like the entire friendship didn’t mean anything. 

While he’s a bit “unhinged” in some ways… idk. I just miss him. Maybe I more so miss the dynamic of our friendship/friend group, but still. Ugh. I don’t understand how or why things had to end like this. But maybe it’s for the best… and maybe I should stop trying to reach out to him. It’s hard still living in a house with some of his random things left around. I still wake up expecting to talk to him after he has his coffee and cigarette. Little things like that.

My theroy was if I could fit everything in one pot itd save space. I bought a big 1.2L cup/pot that could fit a medium gas canister in it. Holds my coffee stove and canister inside.

I bought a knock off soto windmaster, camping moon for a stove. Went out backpacking and it worked well. For 2 days and went out of gas. About 50% less fuel efficent.

It was near freezing, in canada. I think cause there was so much exposed metal above the water while boiling it takes longer. I could cut the top off. But then all the stove  components wouldnt fit inside.

I didnt use a lid or cozy on either. I read lid decreases boiling time by 25%. Even if a cozy adds another 25% i'd need another 50% to get to jetboil levels, which uses neither.

Also the jetboil+canister is pretty much the exact same size as the new pot, also 2g off in weight.

A regular 550ml pot and pocketrocket might be good too, my bag of coffee grounds would be the only thing that fits in the cup. The Fire maple petrel cup looks amazing to me.

I think im just wasting money trying save space and weight in something already suitable. My jetboil isnt the average one, I bought it years ago, its the smallest lightest model ive seen.

Conclusions- The size of pot you use has a massive impact on boil time. Pots take up very little room since you can stuff things inside them. Jetboils are very overpriced but are fuel efficent. Putting everything in one container might not actually save space, can fit canister in crevasses. Jetboils would be way worse the the burner didnt fit perfectly in the cup.

The event will take place from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Thursday, Nov. 21, offering attendees the chance to meet the Las Vegas point guard and Olympic gold medalist.

The evening promises to attract a notable crowd of cigar enthusiasts. While the event is open to the public, space is limited, and reservations are highly recommended. Attendees may also encounter other prominent Vegas athletes.

To mark the occasion, Eight Lounge will feature a special pairing of Plum's cigar with its signature Peanut Butter Chocolate Martini. The cocktail, priced at $80, is crafted with Skrewball Peanut Butter Whiskey, crème de cacao, Mr. Black coffee liqueur, and heavy cream.

Plum’s cigar is wrapped in Connecticut shade-grown paper and filled with premium Nicaraguan tobaccos from Estelí. It offers flavors of vanilla and buttery toasted nuts, finishing with a daring peppercorn note. The cigar's smooth smoke is designed to complement the martini's dessert-like qualities, creating a sophisticated indulgence.

Following the event, Plum’s Kingmakers cigar will be available for purchase in the lounge's humidor and on the menu, regularly priced at $65.

So, I returned this week to my hometown as my best friend is visiting after 6 years. She lives abroad. My cousins are also coming back after finishing their courses. 
All of us planned to meet each other this week, the only problem we were afraid of were my AM mom and her jealousy and selfish nature.
And it took half a day for everything to go for a toss.
She started crying and slowly workwd up her way to screaming because she thought I don't love her. It was my brother's birthday and I dared ask him what he wanted to do on it. Thats it.

She had already planned the day for us, she had asked day to clear first half off for my brother (without asking said brother), she then wanted to go to a religious place at other end of the city 
After that she wanted to visit her fav showrooms to shop.

My brother said he didn't feel like shopping on his birthday and would prefer if we simply went to a cafe to have a coffee.

Thats it. Ahe alowly built up a sad face and started crying and slowly the dqy became about her . Till at 2 in night she was screaming. Giving divorce threats to dad becaue he never protected her, suicide threats to me, slapped me and shit.
Said how when my brother married his wife would do same to her like we do.

All shades of bat shit ceazy she went. This fucking narcissistic bitch got what she wanted in the end because of course everyone now is too drained to deal with her. 
I am planning to leave early and stay in my room. My brother also has just switched on his numbness mode and atays at work with dad all day.

This lady though is sure happy now, eating to her whims while watching series on TV.

1gogxnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1gogxnd/tifu_i_have_been_spreading_bedbugs/,TIFU I have been spreading bedbugs. ,"I’m posting this now because I know people are probably still too distracted by the election results or whatever to even notice. But I need to tell my story to someone, or at least part of it. I need to know that some part of me is normal and this can all be explained. I need to know that I didn’t splinter completely away from the reality I used to know. I want to also lead with the fact that I am not trying to scare people or cause any issues. Part of me doesn’t understand why I do this or how it got to this level. The other part was so fucking angry and I wanted others to feel how I felt. To lose what I lost. But now I am at peace. Most days I am happy. I just want to know that I’m not as alone as I feel somedays . I’m tired of feeling like an outcast and a reject. There has to be someone else I can truly share this lifestyle with. 

This all started in Massachusetts in 2018. I had been living in a place with a roommate and he moved out. I posted a random ad on Facebook to fill the room after not having luck finding someone at work or school. I ended up meeting a nice enough older guy who was originally from the area but was moving back from Georgia. We were complete internet strangers at the time but I had an okay feeling and needed the help with rent bad enough that I let him move in. My girlfriend liked him as well which was arguably the deciding factor. Let’s just call him Mike. 

Anyways, Mike moved in, got a job quick enough and life just went on. He didn’t have much stuff. Just a big trunk, lots of clothes in garbage bags, a TV, a mattress and a box spring. He kept to himself, I kept to myself and everything seemed normal. 

The bites showed up on my girlfriend first. In fact I don’t even think I was reactive at first. It was summer time and I think we both wrote it off as mosquitoes. I had one of those cheap window fans and at the time that outside entry point made the most sense. But then I started seeing them. The first time I remember clearly. Like vividly clear. I was laying on my back in bed watching Netflix and I just casually noticed one crawling near my crossed arms on the blanket. They look just like little beetles. I casually reached forward and just pinched it between my fingers to kill it. I remember being surprised that it didn’t crush and having to kind of grind it with friction between my fingertips to actually kill it. It reminded me of how we would kill dog ticks as kids. I also clearly remember seeing blood mixed in with its twisted little body. I didn’t think much of it at the time. 

Looking back, I have killed hundreds if not thousands of them. But this is the one that I remember. The one I feel bad for and the one that I regret killing. Knowing what I know now about these misunderstood and endlessly interesting little creatures I wouldn’t have picked her up and bothered her in the first place. (She is a she in my brains version of events) But her memory and her wrath live on and I will do my part to continue my work. 

I started seeing them everywhere, but nowhere at the same time. Bugs really didn’t bother me one way or the other so I thought nothing of it. It’s an apartment, there are going to be bugs. On my bath towel when I would get out of the shower, on the couch, I watched two of them crawl back between the outlet cover when I reached down to plug my vape charger back in. The lint trap. I would always find them in the dryer lint trap. And yes, the bed. But honestly back then I remember this the least. 

It was actually my girlfriend that finally figured it out and named them. By this time I had been seeing them for a few months and just never mentioned it. She was a girl and girls get freaked out by bugs. At the time I don’t think I really grasped the ramifications of the situation and had no previous experience with bedbugs. The one thing I still do regret is not telling her sooner of what I suspected. If she ever does read this she will know who I am. So here is my apology, for that part at least. 

She freaked out. I think I freaked out because she was so worried and I saw this as possibly losing her. Covid was full blown at this point. She “lived” with her cousin but slept at my house almost every night. It was something she was worked up over and I cared about her so I took it seriously. I dove down the rabbit hole and ended up right here on Reddit. On r/bedbugs. 

Bug bombs, vacuuming, sprays, diatomaceous earth, DIY traps. I got everything I could read about and afford and prepared to go to war. I can still remember purposefully going to the stores with self checkouts because I didn’t want anyone to know. It felt like a dirty secret. That feeling is gone now. The shame, the guilt. But for now and until now it’s still in someways my secret. 

Mike was a private person and a homebody. But he was the only variable. This started when he showed up. I don’t want to relay anger in my words towards him now, but this is the emotion I felt at the time. Betrayed. I also realize this emotional response had a lot to do with my fear of losing my relationship and a genuine irrational paranoid mindset due to the pandemic. But I still needed to know. 

With my areas treated and my resources/armory stocked in my own closet I took the chance I had to check his room when he was at work. Not even two steps into the room and it was confirmed. Laundry all along the floor, plates and make shift ashtrays. In the blank spots of floor that weren’t covered by clutter you could see the dead. His bed sat pushed up against the wall with no sheet on the mattress. Just a thin blanket and a pillow with no case. Brown stains on the surface, the side walls and all along every seem of stitching that held the edges of the mattress together. On the pillow. On the box spring. On the baseboard next to the bed. This was all his blood. Or worse, who knows maybe some of mine and my girlfriends at this point. I remember feeling furious. From what I know now this was an infestation and I had been living 10 feet away through a wall. Sharing a bathroom. Living room. He must have known and this must have come with him from Georgia. 

To make a long story shorter, please just let this introduction serve as some context. I fought this for months. I tried everything. We tried everything. But I lost. My girlfriend and I broke up. (She says this wasn’t the reason but it started from this point and slowly just imploded.) Being my job was disrupted from Covid I worked remotely half the time which was like a prison sentence being home. I was always on edge. I couldn’t get comfortable anywhere or rest at night. I felt itchy all the time. I spent hundreds of dollars fighting this force I couldn’t always see and always was defeated. Mike moved out after tensions between everything boiled over. My mom was hospitalized due to Covid related issues and left disabled. So i fucking gave up. I threw in the towel. I moved back out of state to move in with her and took back my old childhood bedroom. I took a pay cut and got a shitty job, I started drinking heavily and I left that life, that nightmare behind and tried to start over. I lost my life, my career, my education, my girlfriend and my friends. But there is one thing I did not lose. 

I work as a delivery driver now. The company is not important. The state does not matter. Just know I am always in and out of neighborhoods and delivering packages with a smile. I was sitting in my truck looking at this stupid fucking scanner and felt a little tickle on my face. I knew what it was but this time it hit me different. I wasn’t mad, I wasn’t creeped out. I just was. I gently grabbed the bug and pinched it in between my fingers like I had done over a year and a half ago. But this time I released my grip and just stared. There on my finger was this little bug I had given so much power away to. That I had blamed for all my problems. It didn’t look so scary now. I felt bad for it honestly. I can’t tell you the reason, but i took my other hand and gripped the next package on my list. I pinched the corner of the box to open it slightly and stuck my finger in and just kind of twisted my finger. When my finger came back out, the bug was gone. It was like a relief in such a strange and empowering sense that I have trouble rationalizing it or describing it. I delivered the package. 

That night when I got home I felt alive for the first time in a long time. Like a high. I have not drank since this day. This will be the first thing I am openly thankful to these insects for. For giving me that part of my life back. Also in a way for giving me this new lease on life and why I am here. 

This may be where this story gets darker for some of you, but I have a feeling this is where some of you may start to relate to it. The rise of the underdog. The reckoning. The righting of wrongs. The revenge. The beautifully ugly rebirth of someone who thought they had lost everything but had really needed to shed their skin and find a new place. I am finally comfortable with my purpose and why I was put through this. I know the majority of the minority still reading will somehow understand this. You have to. 

I did my research. I started learning everything I could. How they are raised for research. How they spread naturally and if it can be accelerated. How do they feed bedbugs in the lab? What are the laws? You would be surprised what you can order on the internet. You would also be surprised by the lack of regulations. I guess expecting intention is a loop hole that can be exploited. Did you know most adult bed bugs can survive over a year without feeding? Do you know how handy this is when it comes to population control and separation trials? Bedbugs live for around two years and can produce three or more generations each year. It’s usually more than 3 from my observation. They can hide almost anywhere and thrive in the worst conditions. I always found this as a comforting metaphor for survival and perseverance. 

It’s just Mom and I here at home. She keeps getting worse but I’m here and she always says that’s what she needs and wanted. I’m not sure if she minds them or even notices more than what she mentions them. But she has become the “baby sitter” when I’m working. She can’t get out of that fucking bed anyways. And here I am in my forties. I am all she has and in a way this is the least she can do considering everything. It didn’t take long for them to find her and I constantly rescue healthy adults from her side of the upstairs. 

At work I call them gift bags. They’re quite easy to make. Coffee filter twisted into a kind of parachute style. Making sure the twist naturally opens on its own. I just use a popsicle stick to pry open the box enough and just drop it inside. Usually three adults, a few teenagers and if I have the inventory, a few babies. 

At first I was just letting individuals go inside the packages but I realized it was a numbers game. Bedbugs are not asexual and need a male and female to mate. I don’t know why I wasted my time thinking one individual would do anything but I guess I learned fast at least. The terrariums make it easier to separate adults, juveniles and nymphs. Which was easily my best purchase next to the feeding boxes. That’s a whole other story/tutorial. 

I want you to understand the intent is not malicious in the typical sense of that word. But I have to believe there is a reason for everything. I’m into this too far and in a way bound to this pathway. 

I have found meaning. I have become so much more social and started going out again. I bring them with me almost everywhere. I mean intentionally, although they do still call the shots as nature’s hitchhikers. I am aware of so much now. I notice details I never would have and I’m wondering when the switch happened if not gradually then overnight. I think about them constantly and where I will start the next family. I have started so many already. 

Movie theaters, grocery stores, libraries, doctors offices, my dentist, different restaurants, anywhere oh anywhere with a carpet. I volunteer now. I help neighbors. I go to church. I am finally involved in this community I grew up in and for years resented. I have taken back my independence. That’s what they have given me. I have learned to become a functioning member of a collective of many, many individuals. 

I am not a bad person. I am not a hooded figure hiding in the shadows. I’m not lurking around a corner somewhere. I’m out in the neighborhood and people waive at me. I stop to chat. Kids like me. I love animals. I’m just confident in my newfound convictions and I’m sticking to them. 

I don’t know if this will go on forever. But for now it’s not going to stop. I feel better already sharing this. 

TLDR - I have consciously bred and spread thousands of bedbugs over the last 3 years during my job and my free time. ",0,1731289595.0,tifu,50,0.06,False

1gogx5z,https://v.redd.it/p5sm9m9pg60e1, The secret to creamy low cal icecream,"So I’ve been on the hunt for a while now for low cal pints and I’ve cracked the secret!

All you need is three ingredients, protein custard (muscle nation), unsweetened coconut milk (with a high fat content) and sugar free pudding mix!  Plus a gum of some sort.

So really four ingredients but gums don’t really count.

Anyhow, the thing with this recipe is you can’t just wack it all in the same cup, you have to take your time with it.

Ingredients

- 20grams of muscle nation custard protein, any flavor (73 cals)
- 5grams of pudding mix (8 cals)
- 200 ml of unsweetened coconut milk (36 cals)

Method

1. Get a large bowl and electric whisk. 
2. Place the custard, pudding mix and xantham in a bowl.
3. Add a small amount of water into the bowl, and mix with a spoon until a paste forms.
4. Slowly add more water, don’t drown your paste!  Get your electric mixer and start whisking. It should resemble custard 
5. Add more water, until you’ve got a thick milkshake consistency.  Keep mixing it with the electric mixer, you physically cannot whisk it too much so just keep doing it.
6. Then add 100ml of coconut milk, whisk and repeat with the next 100ml
7. Pour the mixture into the pint, and whisk again!
8. Place it in the freezer for 24hours 
9. Do not defrost just pull it out of the freezer and spin three times on icecream, then one respin and mix in.

You can add pudding mix and yogurt in the second icecream spin if you want it extra creamy.

Now the ice cream i featured was this recipe except replacing the water with instant coffee, whipped with stevia.  Which resulted in an amazing coffee icecream.  Obviously this recipe results in icy edges on the sides of the pint, i haven’t been able to solve that yet.  But this is what you have to sacrifice to ensure low cal icecreamy goodness.  In my opinion.

Tips and tricks:
- you can use soda or 0 cal drinks in place of the water to add flavor, I used diet ginger beer at one point and it was the best ginger bread icecream ever!!
- adding 5 grams of peanut protein powder (on top of the regular recipe) was a recent addition I tried and it’s my favorite so far!

So yea that’s my current obsession right now.  Just fyi the brand of coconut milk I use has a fat content of 4.7 per 100grams I think??  Which def helps I recon.  ",1,1731289550.0,ninjacreami,3,1.0,False

1goguhp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1goguhp,Recently shot my first buck with at the age of 15. And the way it happened was certainly different (story’s a bit long),So we were hunting with one of my dad’s buddies who owns 40 acres of land in northern Michigan. We went up there cause we’ve been trying to get a deer for the past 2 years because me and my dad are new. We went up there and the first day we sat in a blind. Nothin for 5 hours then we went in for the night. Next day we wake up 5:45 in the morning and me and my dad go up town to grab some coffee and we were on the move. I sat in a tree stand by myself while my dad was 50 miles away from me by himself. I sat by myself with my cross bow for about 6 hours then I heard my dad shoot his crossbow at a Dow that he hit but was unfortunately shot in the gut :/ which got my heart rate up a bit because I thought we finally shot a deer. After that we stayed in the stands for about another 20 minutes and eventually climbed down to find the blood trail. After about an hour of tracking the blood trail we came across the for and it was definitely injured but ended up wondering off in the deeper part of the woods. So my dad’s buddy ended up heading back up to camp to grab his at to finish the deer off. When he came back we went looking for the doe once again but then after some time we came across a few deer within the area. My dad texted me to load an arrow in after everything went dead silent. From that point I knew what it was. As I was walking into position I came across a doe that was different. She looked at me and I looked at her. I said to myself. “You’re not what I want” so I just let her wander off. Then I walked up a bit more than I got a text from my dad saying “stop” that moment I knew it was near me so I listened. Then I heard leaves rustling around behind me and I slowly turned around and I saw him. I adjusted myself for a moment then he looked at me and I looked at him. It was like a QuickDraw so in that moment I slowly lifted my crossbow up and I shot him dead center in the lung. He took off running for about 130 yards then we found him laying in a bed so my dads buddie decided to put the deer out of its misery which unfortunately he missed and shot the deers jaw :/ which explains the bloody mouth. And somehow the deer took off and ran another 150 yards away. Very weird but surprising. Then eventually we found him drop dead and he was officially the first buck and deer I have ever shot. The other doe was left behind to live another day. Not sure what happened but who knows. The only question I have now is… what should I expect for my next years of hunting?,7,1731289312.0,Hunting,2,0.82,False

1gogq0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkAndDarker/comments/1gogq0a/dark_and_darker_is_almost_my_dream_game/,Dark and Darker is almost my dream game.,"I've wanted an RPG MMO that plays like dark and darker / Kingdom Come for ages. Dark and Darker almost scratches that itch perfectly.

Imagine a huge open world with horse riding, explorable dungeons, and open world pvp. 

You're traveling with four of your best gamer buddies to escort a merchant caravan but then out of nowhere, deep in the dark forest, an ambush of goblins, kobolds, and a massive Troll attack the caravan and you and your friends need to kill them all before they merchants die or the wagon gets destroyed. Then right at the edge of town a small group of NPC bandits tries to jump you. You take them all out but 2 of your friends die in the process. Thank god for that cleric being able to resurrect the dead.

After a short break by a campfire, drinking some Maderna coffee and putting a little work into that wooden carving of Saint Meeka-Vista Julian, you fully recover and successfully escort the merchant into town. He gives you enough gold to replenish your stash of goods, restock on arrows, and repair your armor.

You head to the Adventuring Guild and notice a bounty board with a Wanted Poster for a notorious bandit rogue who's been harassing the local adventurers.

""Wanted: Repoze - 40,000 gold""

You and your friends set out for his last known location.

One of your friends takes a bolt to the back and begins bleeding profusely. The other eats a chain lightning which hurts everyone in your party. Your cleric casts sanctuary to get everyone back up to full hp and the team engages the wizard/rogue duo. Your ranger gets a lucky headshot on one but then a second chain lightning hits and your team decides it's not worth your lives. You begin to fall back but the ranger is confident... Too confident, and eventually gets ran down by a flurry of crossbow bolts and fireballs. The rest of you escape with your lives and return to town.,,

You never got your ranger teammate's discord but it's a permadeath game so you never hear from him again as he creates a new character that spawns back in one of the 3 starter towns with no gear...

Coffee and black tea don't really get me 'in the zone' like pop/energy drinks.

I have seen some prebiotic ""sodas"" on the internet but they're expensive and I'm iffy on chugging glorified kombucha every day. Seeing as Kombucha can actually be harmful too!

The only solution I can imagine is Aldi's Energy drinks because they have only 9g of sugar.

1gogm3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gogm3v/my_m28_fiance_m32_had_a_meltdown_while_mopping/,My (M28) fiance (M32) had a meltdown while mopping and now won't talk to me. Do I try and reach out to fix this or let his depression run its course?,"Hello, I'm M28 Just looking to get some opinions and advice for an argument that I had yesterday with my fiance M32 . We've been together for 6 years now and have purchased our first home together in February this year.

To give some background, I've got OCD and anxiety which I am medicated for, and my fiance has a history of depression which he used to take medication for a few years back, but has since stopped.

Over the weekend we were performing a few cleaning tasks around the house, I like to keep on top of this by doing a big clean every month, my fiance was assisting me with this and initially had no issues with this. However yesterday (Sunday) while he was mopping I noticed he was getting really frustrated with this specific task. We were planning to go get lunch when we were finished cleaning, so I'm not sure if he was feeling rushed or hangry? Here's some things I have noticed that frustrated him:

- He first started mopping downstairs, then started upstairs. As he was mopping upstairs he said (and I paraphrase) ""fuck, I left my keys downstairs in an area I already mopped."" Knowing that we were going to leave once the mopping was done, we needed to prepare to leave so the house can dry. I suggested to just shuffle over the wet floor on a clean towel to grab his keys (and my keys, as I had forgotten them too). He basically said ""fuck it, I'll just get the keys then mop again."" I noticed at this point he was already frustrated.

- Once he came back upstairs (after re-mopping) he said ""FUUCK I FORGOT MY WALLET"" in a more frustrated tone. I agreed that it was frustrating and suggested that we wait for the floor to dry before we left. He got our wallets (probably worth noting that we were both equally unprepared) and threw them up the stairs as he was re-mopping again. At this point I was already starting to feel anxious at his frustration.

- It finally comes to the point where we can leave to get lunch. As we're leaving he exclaims ""Wheres my sunglasses?” I said not to worry as I have a spare set of sunglasses in my car. He said ""I don't want to wear those sunglasses they don't do shit"". He went back inside and went to the drawer that we keep our wallets and keys in, and retrieved his sunglasses. This time he tried to shrug it off with ""lucky I have long legs"" (implying that he didn't have to step much on the wet floor to get his sunglasses)

- As he was putting his shoes on in the garage, his phone fell out of his pocket and fell about 40-50cm to onto a carpet (he used an old camping chair in the garage to sit down on whilst putting on his shoes, and it's on an offcut of carpet that we have put down for the shoe area) he was immediately frustrated again, he closed his eyes and let out a loud ""sigh"", checked over his phone for damage, then put it back in his pocket. He didn't say anything this time, but his overall body language just implied frustration and anger, and was blowing up my anxiety.

At this point we are ready to go get lunch. And to preface this part, I have a license, but my fiance doesn't so I've been teaching him to drive in my car. And we had a quick conversation like the below:
Me: ""are you sure you're okay to drive?""
Him: ""Yes I'm fine"" (frustrated tone)
Me: ""That doesn't sound fine""
Him: ""IM FINE""
(A small stretch of silence)
Me: ""I'm going to drive, I don't think you're okay to drive""
Him: ""Go without me then, I'm staying home""

Without hesitation, I jumped in the car and drove off. I tried to have a nice day my myself to make myself feel better. I got lunch, went on a nice walk, stopped by the hardware store to have a browse. I tried not to think about the argument that we had this morning, as I believe we both needed this time to cool off. I was gone for about 4 hours. 

When I got home, my fiance was sitting on the couch watching TV and scrolling his phone. We were both silent towards each other. I shrugged this off and went to install something in the laundry that I purchased from the hardware store. Once I was done, I noticed he paused the TV so I thought now might be a good time to initiate a conversation.

Me: ""How was your day?
Him: ""We need to do the grocery shopping."" (Monotone voice)
I then went a silent as this implied he was angry, and he showed complete disregard for my question. (For clarification, we always to grocery shopping on Sundays so we can meal prep for the week.)

I was thinking about it and didn't think it was a good idea to do the shopping together given that he had just demonstrated complete lack of communication to me. He put on his shoes and sunglasses and gestured towards the car
Him: ""Are you coming?"" 
Me: ""Are you angry at me?"" 
Him: ""Yes.""
Me: ""I'm sorry if me leaving made you upset, however I was anxious and needed time alone to process this. My anxiety has been spiking lately because work is stressful and (stepmum) is getting her results tomorrow to see if her chemo is working (My stepmum has been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer back in July, she had a scan last week and on Monday we find out if the chemo is working, 
Him: ""Ok. Can we go grocery shopping?""
Me: ""I think it would be better if we did our Sunday grocery shop seperate then, because last time you were upset and we went shopping, you stormed out and abandoned me there with a trolley full of groceries. I don't want that to happen again.""
Him: ""Fine.""
So I went to the car, took out some reusable grocey bags and put it on the coffee table for him, as he was sitting on the couch at this point. I then left and did the grocery shopping for myself.
As I was closing the garage door, he said ""Have fun""

I did the grocery shopping, came home, put groceries away, took out the bins, all while he just sat on the couch and scrolled on his phone. The grocery bags were still on the coffee table. We didn't say a single word to each other. He slept on the couch last night, and used the guest bathroom to shower and brush his teeth. This morning on his way to work, he didn't even wave at the doorbell camera like he usually does.

This whole situation is so confusing to me, we both have seperate mental health issues, and are both bad at communication. Sometimes I will muster up some courage to try to strike up a conversation about what went wrong, but he'll generally shoot this down immediately and I will go silent too as a result of my anxiety.

I don't want to split up with him because I still love him, I'm just so confused on how to approach this now

On one hand, I didn't like how he spoke to me. He brushed off all my suggestions when he was frustrated with the floor mopping, and he just expected me to go with him for groceries like an uber driver.

On the other hand, he probably doesn't feel too great about how I left him behind for both lunch and groceries.

Question: Could anyone please provide any unbiased advise on how to fix this? Is it possible that my fiance's depression is coming back?

Thanks

TLDR: Fiance got upset while mopping, I couldn't handle the stress when he was upset so I left and had a day to myself. He's now upset at me for abandoning our lunch plans, I didn't want to go shopping with him while he was upset. Now we're not talking to each other ",0,1731288591.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

Also I would like to say that I'm a first time mom of a 6 month old working full time, so that's why nespresso was working for me.
I'm looking for better quality coffee and digging into making my own espresso is something that interests me a lot! I'm looking for a good starting setup and I'm conflicted between the following three:
1. Breville Bambino Plus + Breville Smart Grinder
2. Breville barista pro
3. Breville barista touch
I feel like the first option will be the best long term, but I'm scared that will be harder learning curve and that I will get frustrated.
Second option sounds like a pretty great fit to learn and have an all in one machine, but I don't know if grinder will be something that will make me unhappy
Third option seems like it will help me a lot to learn, but again same issue about the grinder and I don't know if the touch screen can get damaged over time!

Mine was more steady but less passionate, which led to her feeling insecure about my affection towards her. I think I might have ROCD, which already made me insecure about whether I was loving her enough, the relationship was right, etc. I felt numb, over analyzed my feelings and thoughts, was hyper vigilant to her emotions and behavior. 
She broke up with me, I was sad but I understood why. We went no contact, I questioned the breakup afterwards, i grieved it, went into a quite depressive state for a month. She texted me a few weeks later, telling me she missed me in her life. We texted a bit, a few days later I asked to meet up, to talk about the relationship, exchange our things… we met in a bar, talked a lot… I couldn’t help but feeling drawn to her, we got closer, eventually kissed. It felt beautiful and natural, but we also agreed that the old problems didn’t disappear. She even asked me to still go on a trip with her that we had planned for a while (I was tempted but I declined). We thought about how we can move forward. I said that I need to figure out my issues and that I don’t feel stable enough to be in a relationship. Neither of us liked the idea of no contact, but being friends seemed challenging… we texted more and she said maybe there’s nothing to be done and that’s okay. To me that kind of helped me to let go. To sit with the ambiguity, letting things flow for a while, I felt at peace for a day or two.

But today she called me and confessed that she can’t stop thinking about us, that she got really attached again after meeting up and making out, that she reflected on all the beautiful parts of the relationship and that she wants to give it another try. I was honest and said that it was easier for me to let go since then. We had a long talk about what to do. We settled on giving being friends a try. That we can text and call each other, meet for coffee, just no alcohol, no flirting and kissing or being at each other’s places for now. She said she just needs some form of continuity and that she feels that need to be close to me. I’m also still attached and I don’t wanna go no contact. But I’m unsure if this is right. I’m too attracted to her to be a friend and too detached to be a girlfriend. I have just gotten out of the breakup rut, felt at peace. Worst of all, her being so attached and me being so detached triggered me: why am I so fine with not being together? I was the dumpee, I should be so happy she wants to get back together. Maybe I never loved her as much as she loved me etc. 

I think it’s good that I can feel my needs a lot better now that I’m single. And I think it’s fair and healthy for me to not want to get back together after she dumped me and I went through one of the hardest heartbreaks I ever had. I’m just envious of the strength of her feelings. I feel like, when I detach I detach, I had a bit of a fallback and I still like her, but there is just no… want or desire for romantic love. With anyone. That part of me used to be so big and now it’s nowhere to be found. And she’s still daring to ask to get back together, she seems to be so in love. I think her intensity always flattered and scared me at the same time. It’s like I can never live up to it. Time will tell if this being friends thing works. Or if we need to go no contact. Or if I realize I wanna get back together. I’m trying to sit with my unsureness, but it’s hard. Do u have any thoughts or tips on this? I know this is messy 🥲",1,1731286997.0,ROCD,0,1.0,False

I’m very much glad this season is over. A failed start, new coach, early injuries, Olympics, bizarre trades - we can put this chaotic year behind us and hopefully do a dutiful search for a GM who can partner and align with our head coach to build a team around a cohesive strategy.

I’m sure in the minority, but I don’t think Rob Gale should get the boot…yet. I’d like to see what he can do with a committed partner as a GM and a solid offseason.

We had some talent that really stepped up this year (looking at you Payne and Muller), and some that really didn’t work out (Fleming, Linnehan, Moultrie). Don’t get me wrong, they had their moments, but Moultrie and Fleming spent much of the season running all over the field, holding the ball too long, or committing errant passes.

Ideally I’d have a 2 bedroom.

I have a friend who lives at The Katy and she said the sound proofing is really good in that building.

‘A little bit of self-respect wouldn’t go astray.’ Jack runs his eyes over Courtney, expecting to see a moral image of himself. ‘This is not a Sunday stroll along St. Kilda beach.’

‘Well, I didn’t realise a fashion inspection on arrival was a prerequisite.’ Showing some skin, Courtney pirouettes and buttons up her shirt. ‘This is the Department of Birth, Deaths and Marriages, right?’

In town to amend a typo, Courtney demands the letter ‘E’ to be inserted between the ‘N’ and ‘Y’. The misspelling prevents Courtney from meeting the standard one-hundred-point identification requirement. Her name fails to pass cross-matching databases, barring her from accessing online services.

‘This may surprise you, but we’re not standing in the Sistine Chapel staring at the ceiling.’ Jack gives Courtney a blank look as if she’s the world’s biggest dickhead. ‘I’d brace for disappointment if I were you.’

Jack’s lack of motivation helps him withstand the everyday mundane experience. He joined the public service after dropping out of university, and a life dedicated to serving the people does little for his self-esteem. A simple man, he keeps the seat warm and passes time.

‘Just do your job.’ Courtney replies, flicking her birth certificate across the desk.

More a dreamer than a realist, Jack surpasses an idiocy level rarely seen. Behind an impenetrable administrative wall, he lays down the law and demands Courtney prove she’s the person named on the birth certificate. An impossible task when all her documents spell her name correctly.

‘In this department everything is complicated, simple things don’t exist.’ Jack glances at the document and grabs a brochure without bothering to hide his boredom. ‘You should have done some research.’

A hard nut to crack, Jack remains aloof and lukewarm towards fixing the problem. He prefers online requests, rather than walk-in customers and hates face-to-face interactions. He’d like to work from home, but the one day a week he’s required to commute to the office ruins everything.

‘Take a good look at these.’ Reading between the lines Courtney unzips her top and cusps her breasts. ‘How do you like them apples?’

‘Your understanding of how the bureaucracy works worries me.’ Jack turns the other cheek and hands Courtney the brochure. ‘Upload the required documents, and then wait patiently for a response.’

To make ends meet, Courtney, the last elevator operator in Melbourne, struggles to find a job. Skint and on the dole, she’s pawned everything of value. There’s no room in a modern world for an unskilled and uneducated woman. A relic from a bygone era, she’s missed the technological boat and paddles headfirst into a torrent.

Disappointed, Courtney snatches her birth certificate from Jack’s hands and curses the person who misspelt her name. For years the error lay dormant, so much so that Courtny without the ‘E’ has legal status. The unintended consequence is nothing but a great inconvenience and may outlive some religions.

‘I’m sorry for wasting your time,’ a childlike Courtney mumbles. ‘Where can a lady take a piss? Do you want me to do it right here?’

‘Don’t be stupid,’ a stickler for the rules, Jack insists Courtney follow departmental policy. ‘Use the public toilets on the street across the road.’

Access to the marble palace remains a luxury only open to staff. The privilege is not personal, just a hard-won convenience and under his watch, Jack demands she exit the building. A sign adorns the toilet door, reminding visitors not to access the facilities.

‘Better luck next time.’ Without a care in the world, Jack replies and points towards the exit. ‘I don’t write the rules.’

He sharpens a few pencils, then thoroughly wipes the desk, disinfecting every trace of Courtney. These small rituals soothe his soul and he full-heartedly supports the toilet segregation policy. The germaphobe fears cross-contamination, and the department caters to his requests. A simple fix to a complex dilemma.

‘I hate to further your anguish,’ Jack says pointing to the wall. ‘Dig out as many brochures as you want, read them and follow the instructions in the back. Can you read?’

‘How does fuck off sound?’ Courtney snaps and storms towards the lifts. ‘I hope you catch a disease and die before you retire.’

With a bitter sigh, she admires the layout of the elevator as it glides smoothly down. A small joy in a larger battle against entrenched mediocrity. Yet, greeting her on the street, a cold breeze slaps her across the face. No surprise for Melbourne, and somewhat expected as the weather turns on a dime.

Inadequately dressed for the cold she trudges on. Her spirit, weary as her body, is a victim of a system designed to frustrate rather than serve. She disappears into the crowd and notes the public toilets are nowhere to be found. Perhaps a brochure with clear directions and instructions ought to exist.

 ‘Welcome to the pathetic state of Victoria,’ Courtney mumbles and wonders where it all went wrong. ‘The morons have taken over.’

An empty seat gives Jack respite from another encounter, and whether the letter ‘E’ finds its rightful place is no concern to him. He’s seen it all before and understands the ‘benefits’ of inefficiency. Somewhere along the line, the concept of civil service was replaced with doing a whole lot of nothing and life couldn’t get any easier.

‘Anyone for a cafe latte, coffee or a cappuccino,’ the tea lady does the rounds and offers Jack a choice of beverages. ‘Perhaps an orange juice.’

‘Coffee with two sugars and a dollop of milk, please,’ Jack replies and leans back in his chair. 

The End

In one word: I'd rather buy NTLite (www.ntlite.com). It is not for free of course, the home license costs €40 but... it does a wonderful job, allows FULL customization of every aspect of your windows installation (incl. settings), has a GUI and in particular it has an author you can contact and get support from !!!

Don't think I am wicked or bad, and don't think I am in any way affiliated with NTLite cos I am NOT, please just read my experience, then judge.

I needed a fast, slender, update-free, bloat-free Windows 10 installation for my audio workstation (I have been working happily on Windows 7 for many years, but now I am forced to upgrade to Win 10 because the main software I am using, SynthEdit, dropped support for Windows 7). So I looked around and found Tiny10 (a friend also suggested me it). So I tried to install it on a test PC. Everything \*seemed almost\* fine (despite I was quite disappointed to still find the OOBE, requiring me to login into a M$ account and other cr@p, so I had to use the shift/ctrl/F3 trick as illustrated in one YT video). Well, \*seemed almost\* fine (despite some little bugs here and there), until I tried to create a restore point and a system image. Error 0x8007043C in both cases !!!! I.e. Windows thinks I am booting into Safe Mode, while I am not. I googled around, tried out everything to no avail. I cannot renounce those commodities btw, nor I want to resort to 3rd party tools for that. So I decided to contact mr. NTDev for help - and here my frustration began. He has no email address to start with of course (does he fear being sued by M$ for sharing illegal ISO's ??? Meh...). So I tried to ping him on X (twitter). Nope, he doesn't reply to PMs. So I tried to comment on his posts: nope. So I tried commenting on his YT videos: my comments don't get published (banned ?) So I tried to comment on his blog: my comments don't get approved either. So, desperate, I sent him few bucks on Paypal just to send him a message, asking to please get in touch at my email address, cos I needed support with Tiny10. Nope. I sent some bucks again. Nope. I bought him a coffee with a message: nope. I started getting very irritated, but I could not figure out any further options to contact him. I tried asking here for help, but nobody chimed in (evidently nobody ever tried to create system images or restore points with Tiny10...).

And... no, I don't want Win 11, I want Win 10.

So I stumbled across NTLite. I contacted the author asking some basic questions: he replied in less than one hour (despite it was on Sunday). I trialed the Demo. Just one word: WOW. And I was really getting mad with a free debloated ISO I have not any control on its content, in addition from an author who refuses any contact for support and help, and which may (in theory) contain everything, including viruses ? NO WAY.

You judge. I have no interest for being rude or to demolish NTDev's (likely) hard work of course. But these are the \*FACTS\*. So, much better spending €40. IMHHHHO. Or being content with what the Demo version has to offer, which is still very much.",2,1731286176.0,Tiny11,0,1.0,False

“I like you as more than a friend.”

“I’ve had feelings for you for a long time.”

To make things worse, guys will follow up these type of “confessions” with the question of whether she feels the same. 
The answer is almost always a ‘no’, in some shape or form. 
That’s because these type of confessions make women feel cornered—as if someone is suddenly putting a spotlight on them, and is expecting a certain response. Ninety-nine percent of the time they already know if a guy has feelings for them. It doesn’t need to be said.
If you are actually interested in dating her, rather than using her as an emotional sounding board, you have to frame yourself as a potential romantic partner, not creepy friend who vomits his feelings without warning.
- Simply begin to incrementally flirt with her more often. You can’t go from 0-10, it has to be subtle. Also, don’t flirt for the sake of getting a reaction; see if you both have chemistry. Have fun. You might find she isn’t a good fit for YOU beyond friendship.

If she seems responsive to the escalations, then just simply ask her out, not to get coffee as friend, but on an actual date. 
If she says she doesn’t see you as more than a friend, you have your answer. If you don’t want just friendship, then tell her so in an upfront, but respectful manner. Until the feelings fade, keep your distance and keep meeting other women. Your ability to handle rejection like it doesn’t phase you will make you more attractive.

The biggest mistake you can make if you are trying to convert a friend into a romantic partner is to make an announcement of your feelings:

“I like you as more than a friend.”

“I’ve had feelings for you for a long time.”

To make things worse, guys will follow up these type of “confessions” with the question of whether she feels the same. 
The answer is almost always a ‘no’, in some shape or form. 
That’s because these type of confessions make women feel cornered—as if someone is suddenly putting a spotlight on them, and is expecting a certain response. Ninety-nine percent of the time they already know if a guy has feelings for them. It doesn’t need to be said.
If you are actually interested in dating her, rather than using her as an emotional sounding board, you have to frame yourself as a potential romantic partner, not creepy friend who vomits his feelings without warning.
- Simply begin to incrementally flirt with her more often. You can’t go from 0-10, it has to be subtle. Also, don’t flirt for the sake of getting a reaction; see if you both have chemistry. Have fun. You might find she isn’t a good fit for YOU beyond friendship. 
- 0-2: make a casual comment about her appearance that you genuinely feel. “You look great when you wear your hair that way”. “You look really cute in that color.” Express it in a way that you didn’t really notice it until now, and that you’re making more of an observation rather than an overt compliment.
- 2-4: The next time you see her, jokingly tease her (not neg), the same way a boyfriend would joke around with his girlfriend. “I don’t know if we’d work as a couple, you’re ridiculous sometimes”.

1gofq3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoImmuneProtocol/comments/1gofq3a/food_reintroductions_can_some_foods_be_combined/,Food Reintroductions - can some foods be combined?,"Hi there! 

Just finished my elimination phase of the Core AIP and starting to reintroduce foods. Was just curious (and I can't find any resources on this ANYWHERE) - can some similar foods be assumed to be tolerated if you have reintroduced another from the food group?

For example in stage 1 of reintroductions, legumes section, you can reintroduce green beans, runner beans, peas, snow peas, and sugar snap peas. Now peas, snow peas, and sugar snap peas - to me at least - are very similar. Can I assume if I pass the test for one, I can reintroduce all? Spending over a month reintroducing all of them seems a bit stark!   
  
I potentially assumed maybe the groupings in each stage could be reintroduced all together, but stage one has both chocolate and coffee in the same section (Nuts and seeds) and I assume they aren't similar enough to assume if you can have one you can have another.  

But yeah I feel like a few nightshades, legumes, nuts/seeds, maybe dairy could be introduced together? I just introduced egg yolk first (I used a chicken egg) and it has listed Chicken, duck, goose, quail etc - I want to be able to assume I can eat all now? But just need confirmation. 

I may be missing something on this - but if anyone has any advice please let me know or point me in the right direction! Don't want to seem like I am trying to take shortcuts etc. but understandably with such an extensive protocol, if there is anything that can be done to streamline the process, i'll take it!

I'm following the CORE guide on this page as well for reference - [https://autoimmunewellness.com/how-to-reintroduce-food-on-aip-the-definitive-guide/](https://autoimmunewellness.com/how-to-reintroduce-food-on-aip-the-definitive-guide/)",1,1731285857.0,AutoImmuneProtocol,0,1.0,False
1gofq2t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gofq2t,Update: South Africa Gin Haul - Taste Test! ,"I sampled all my gins from my South Africa trip! I did not sample the Hendrick’s Amazonia this round but I tried it last night and remember it to have a nice floral nose but a sharper biting finish. Included pictures of the label in hopes that it adds to your digital tasting experience! I tried everything neat and had my trusty coffee beans nearby to huff in between gins. Enjoy my amateur tasting review!! 

#1. Inverroche Amber 
Nose: Chocolate covered dried orange slices, spices, sultry. 
Palate: Notes of caramel, sits nicely on the tongue, luxurious mouthfeel (didn’t think I’d ever use this word seriously!) 

Gorgeous gin that reminds me of a rich decadent dessert, like a warm caramel crème brule sort. Absolutely delicious served neat. 

#2. Cape saint blaize
Nose: Like smelling a lemon twist while standing on the coast, salty ocean spray, earthy (from the rooibos). 
Palate: Citrusy, herbal, the brightness of sea salt, crisp. 

Earth, citrus, and sea breeze come together but somehow don’t taste muddled. The flavors take turns beautifully in one of the most unique gin profiles I’ve experienced (which to be fair is not much lol) 

#3. Amarula
Nose: Mellow amarula, citrus, light juniper
Palate: Classic gin with gentle notes of amarula and citrus, nice juniper, sharper on the tongue at the end but not overpowering 

Produced by Heineken so it tastes like a good corporate gin with quality citrus and a nice nuttiness from the amarula fruit. 

#4. Cape Town Gin Rooibos
Nose: Steeped rooibos, herbal, orangey. 
Palate: Spiced tea, warmth, sits well on the tongue, rooibos flavor lingers around after sipping

This tastes like a nice warm cup of spiced tea. Could be made into a gin-based hot toddy! 

#5. Blind tiger blue
Nose: Deliciously sweet, dragonfruit, floral and fruity. 
Palate: Blueberry and dragonfruit, crisp, light, the wine cooler of gins (major complement in my eyes). 

An incredible gin that has bold dragonfruit and blueberry flavor paired with subtle elderflower. A real pretty light blue color too! Goes down a little too well, would be amazing in a cocktail or chilled neat on a hot summer evening. ",5,1731285856.0,Gin,2,1.0,False
