We all know those late-night study marathons can be brutal, but caffeine and a few smart strategies can make all the difference. I wanted to share some ideas that have helped me push through those long nightsm, and I'd love to hear your tips too!

Here's what works for me:

1. **Caffeine Rotation:** Switch between coffee, tea, and energy drinks to avoid a crash. Herbal teas like peppermint can also keep you awake without overloading on caffeine.
2. **Snacks That Energize:** Go for brain fuel like nuts, fruit, or dark chocolate instead of junk food.
3. **The 25-Minute Rule:** Study intensely for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break to stretch or move around. It keeps me sharp.
4. **Music:** Lo-fi beats or instrumental playlists help me focus without distractions. 
5. **Hydration:** Don't forget water - being dehydrated can mess with your energy levels.

What are your go-to strategies for surviving those late-night cramming sessions? Do you have a favorite study snack, playlist, or caffeine trick? Let's build the ultimate guide to powering through the night! 🚀☕",1,1737489747.0,CaffeineAndCrams,0,1.0,False

At work, I'm friendly, talk about fashion and our weekends...but then in work outings I'm always sitting alone and people act awkward around me.

Sometimes I talk to people and they just don't know what to talk to me about? I don't try to fill the silence and then we just end up both being quiet and moving on...

It sucks, I've had this problem all my life, trying to make friends and people don't even think about me when they have get togethers or never invite me.

There were moments I had a good time, but others were so uncomfy. So I'm sharing my experience as someone on the higher end of the spectrum so other young adults on the higher end have some knowledge before going to special needs prom.

1. As far as I am aware, the only special needs proms I have been to or heard of require the disabled young adult to have a parent sign them up. This means that higher functioning folks who don't still live with their parents are outta luck, as far as I am aware.
2. Chaperones. I was so annoyed by this. I can understand having chaperones for those on the lower end who may need to be supervised, but those higher on the spectrum should be able to opt out of that. It honestly felt so infantilizing, like they were lumping us all in the same little box of needing such guidance. Plus, due to being forced to have a chaperone, I felt like any conversation was steered by said chaperone and I was talking more to them than to other special needs adults like I wanted to. This made me super uncomfortable, I don't like my conversations with other adults being monitored and controlled like that.
3. Food. Most of the special needs proms I went to had food that felt more catered towards children, once again making me feel infantilized. It's a prom, not a school cafeteria, at least have some decent hot food! But I was especially mad at this with one particular prom where the promgoers got wraps and juice and maybe a cookie I don't remember exactly... but then the parents, who were in another room, had pasta and chicken and soda and coffee!! How is that fair?? It's our prom, not theirs, we should be the ones getting that good food!
4. There was this one prom that had activities you had to pay extra for, which was scummy. I can understand wanting to fundraise, but not at a prom...

That's all I can really think of for now, but yeah. Do not recommend if you are on the higher end of the spectrum.",1,1737489650.0,autism,1,1.0,False

I had my first date with a girl. It wasn’t really pleasant because she was busy and had to take two calls and answer an email over lunch and coffee. I mean she was apologetic enough about it, even letting me see her email. Aside from that we actually got to discuss a lot of stuff about us even love languages, childhood memories, aspirations, that stuff. 

That evening, I asked if she got home safe. We chatted a bit. She said she had fun and would go out with me again. No plans yet.

Two days after our date. She and her parents went on a vacation. It was planned months in advance. We even talked about it over the date. I texted her “have a safe trip” a few hours before her flight. Inserted a subtle flirt which she ignored. Perhaps she’s not feeling it because she hates planes and airports and is pressured to be the one planning the entire trip. We had no communication during her vacation. I didn’t message either to give her space with family. 

She texted me upon returning home and we chatted as usual. But then she fell ill to food poisoning. I wished her well. She joked that she’s probably dead. I  said i must be talking to an angel then (okay i think this one is witty lmao). It seems like she ignored my flirt once again and left me on read.

I feel like im pushing it too hard on the flirting these days. But she enjoyed it so much days before our first meeting so i thought it’s something she likes.  I understand my bad timing though.

I’m also probably overthinking if she’s losing interest because she ignored my flirts and we had no communication for a while because of the trip.

A less than pleasant first date is messing me up too.

Should i converse with her normally and ease up on the flirting? Perhaps just check in if she’s feeling better.

Or just give her more space (and wait for her to initiate) as she had a lot going on?  She catching up with work despite being sick.",2,1737489255.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

It was founded by a hockey player that played for the Leafs for many years.  The donuts were baked in house by actual bakers and the coffee was always fresh and hot.  The boys, decked out in their toques, plaid and denim, would sit around and shoot the crap at the numerous tables, steaming mugs of Always Fresh at hand.  There'd always be a tow truck idling in the parking lot.  Quintessential Canadian.  No one had to tell us it was so, it just was.  Proudly ours.  A shared experience.

Now, its a QSR with almost no seating, nasty reheated pastries and almost universally dismal service.  Most folks use the drive through and almost no one goes to run into the boys there anymore.  Its a sad, shallow ghost of the past.  

And yet; and yet, this company, which is majority owned by a Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital, continues to wrap itself in Canadiana.

How id love to be one of those people who completely detonates their entire life. I don’t know how people do this work/life balance bullshit but it’s for the fucking birds. I’m just sitting in the parking lot of an old bed, bath, and beyond with a cup of coffee and another smoke while I watch my inboxes overflow. What a miserable day.

1i6rg18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i6rg18/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_celebrate_my_birthday/,AITAH for not wanting to celebrate my birthday?,"Using a throw away as to not associate this with my main account 

I (27M) have never really, ""got,"" other people. I've never really had close friends, I've never been close with my family, I've never really understood other people or why they do things and they have felt the same way about me. And to be clear, I am completely unbothered by this. I do not want to be liked or understood. I don't desire to be hated or go out of my way to hurt others, either; I'm just mostly neutral to other human beings

I've never had trouble getting along with others. I know how I should try to act to seem, ""normal,"" by others to get them to like me. I was never unpopular or bullied because I had an understanding of what social norms there were, even if I didn't understand the norms themselves, from observation throughout my early childhood. So, I am not hated; quite the opposite. I, personally, am just totally impartial to other human beings and connections with them 


All this to say, until recently I'd never had a, 'romantic,' relationship and was still a virgin. All throughout high school and college, I had never really made an effort in that front because it seemed rather pointless to me. I didn't see how it was personally efficient for me to put my time and energy into someone else's wellbeing. Women showed me affection occasionally, but I always showed no interest; I turned them down politely because I simply didn't care

Nine months ago or so, an old acquaintance from high school informed me he would be in my city for a couple days (I moved away for college) and asked if I wanted to meet up. I wasn't opposed, so I told him yes. He also ended up telling me he was attending a party in town, and invited me to attend; I had never attended such an event before and so agreed, as I was curious as to whether I'd enjoy it

While there, a woman he seemed to be familiar with approached us. She immediately began talking to me and asking about me. I was rather confused as to why she was talking to me, but my friend later explained she was very attracted to me and was, ""flirting,"" with me, another thing I have a very hard time understanding. We continued talking, as I wasn't having an unpleasant experience talking with her. My friend left to go talk to some other friends 

We ended up leaving a few hours later. This girl, I learned, was 23F at the time and named Jackie. She kept putting her hands on my arms and laughing when I didn't even make a joke and staring straight into my face. I was kind of perturbed but continued speaking with her. When I went to find my friend, she seemed rather disappointed. I was extremely confused at this point, but didn't press the issue 

We had driven together, and my friend, rather incredulously, explained how his friend (he explained they had met when he was in this area previously, but hadn't known each other were attending the party) was very attracted to me and wanted me to ask her out or sleep with her. This was fairly shocking to me, as she never made any of this explicit or said it outright. He almost thought I was joking that I hadn't picked up on it, but I told him the truth, that I simply don't understand such things

Anyways, my friend left town, and I hardly thought of the incident until I was getting coffee by my office one day about a week or two later. I ran into Jackie, who told me she was a server at a restaurant nearby and was coming in before her shift. She seemed very happy to see me, and remembering what my friend had told me, I asked for her number, something I'd never done before. I figured that, since I had never had sex or dated a girl, it only made sense from a practical perspective to see if I enjoyed it, as I did not know at the time. She was elated, and kissed me fully on the mouth in public; I did not dislike the sensation 

That was about nine months ago. We have been dating for most of that time, and we are now official as of about seven months ago. Her lease expired just a couple months ago, and since I own my own home and we started becoming, ""serious,"" according to my mother's descriptions, I offered her to move into my home, rent-free. She happily obliged. I don't dislike her company or our relationship; sometimes I even enjoy spending time with her, something I can honestly say I've never experienced with another person. And the sex can be pleasurable at times, although her libido significantly exceeds my very occasional desires 

We also have very rarely gotten into arguments because I generally care very little about what we do or when. I'm responsible and when she has a problem I always fix it because I don't really care one way or the other. So we've never had a serious fight before now simply because we didn't have anything to fight about 

My birthday is in January, so I had turned 27 a few months before meeting Jackie; this is my first birthday I've had with her. She turned 24 in October.

One thing about me is I don't really care for celebrations. To me, celebrating an occasion such as a birthday or a wedding is a pointless waste of effort and money; the wedding doesn't marry you, the birthday party doesn't make you older. It just feels pointless, so I've always disliked it. I stopped having birthdays when I was 12. I did not attend either my high school graduation or college graduation ceremonies, much to the dismay of my parents or friends 

Now, I have no problems celebrating other's occasions, if it sates them; I try my best to do whatever keeps the peace. However, even though it's frustrated almost everyone in my life (which I do not understand,) I ask that my coworkers, family and friends completely ignore my birthday. I don't want presents, I don't want a call, I don't want even to be texted happy birthday. And to be clear, I don't hate or dislike my birthday or myself; I am just completely neutral towards it and see it as pointless. I also do not like getting Christmas presents

My girlfriend asked about my birthday in late November so she could begin preparing, I told her this. She had a similarly perplexed reaction to my mother's when I told her something similar when I was in middle school. She was both confused and slightly upset 

I completely forgot about it because I don't care about my birthday, until my actual birthday. It happened to fall on a Saturday, so she woke me up, made me breakfast in bed, got me some biking (one of my few hobbies) equipment that was very expensive, and scheduled a dinner with my coworkers and acquaintances. She also scheduled my parents to send me a very intricate and special card with photos and memories of my childhood 

As I said, there is very little in life that actually bothers me, so none of this was actively upsetting to me. However, as I explained, I am generally totally neutral to such things and so I apparently acted completely unenthused and checked out the entire time 

Jackie put up an act all day like it didn't bother her, but when we finally got home she broke down in tears crying that she'd tried so hard to finally give me a good birthday and it seemed like I didn't care at all. Apparently she was under the impression, as my mother is, that the reason I didn't like my birthdays was related to the fact I'd never had good ones, when in fact my parents had tried very hard to celebrate my birthdays, I just don't particularly enjoy them 

I dislike the sound of crying (again, like celebrating, crying has always seemed unnecessary to me because I don't see how it's productive) so I informed Jackie I was going to bed. This seemed to incite her even further.

We finally got fully, ""into it,"" and she accused me of not really caring about her. She asked me several questions, like whether I actually liked her and spending time with her and whether I valued our relationship or all the work she'd put into it. I answered honestly that I didn't, really; I was, as I am with almost everything in life, mostly neutral towards her. I told her I had said I did not care about my birthday and didn't enjoy it and I had a hard time understanding why she acted all upset when I acted as I informed her I would previously 

I told her I like her more than I do most people and sometimes I even like spending time with her and having sex with her, but she seemed even more upset by this. I was not particularly bothered. When I went to bed, she wasn't in our bed (we usually sleep together) and I discovered the next day she moved her belongings into the guest bedroom and slept there

She has acted cold to me the next few days and has mostly just been focusing on work. My mother called me the next day and told me, extremely upset, how much I had hurt Jackie and how I really needed to apologise to her for what I'd done and said. I told her I had only acted in a way that was, to my understanding, rational. Like Jackie, she seemed even more upset by this 

My mother is one of the few people in my life who I actually enjoy interacting with on occasion; one of the others is Jackie. So, I did actually listen to her even though it was annoying to me. She finally asked if I actually even cared about Jackie and how would I feel if this ended our relationship; I answered honestly. That I did not dislike Jackie and sometimes enjoyed her company, but that I did not feel as though what we had was irreplaceable with another girl just as simply. I am physically attractive, own a home and work a good, high-paying, so finding a replacement would not be difficult 

My mother was so upset she hung up on me. I still had a hard time understanding her point. My old friend from high school, who Jackie is an acquaintance of, must have found out through her and also echoed the same sentiment as my mother

My mother also told me Jackie had wondered if I was autistic. My parents were both fairly conservative during my upbringing, and did not generally trust psychiatrists. They noticed something was unusual about my behaviors but never had them, ""diagnosed."" Which, again, I do not particularly care about. However, one of my siblings came out as transgender after I had already moved out, which radically challenged their worldview, which led to them broadening their belief in such subjects like mental health. Jackie posited this to my mother, and she agreed it was almost certain I was severely autistic. Personally, I do not particularly care one way or the other, as it doesn't really affect how I am 

People generally have a hard time understanding me, which I don't particularly mind. However, when both my mother and my old friend have said I was being a complete jerk, it has made me wonder if I'm a terrible person. So, reddit: AITA?",1,1737488987.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

So, I (M24) have been with my gf (F22) for around 3 years. We had our ups and downs. We went through the worst - we broke up two times and still found each other again. We grew together and now i feel like im a lot more mature than before.

Then my gf came and started arguing with me on why i didn't tell her i was coming. 
I saw where the things are going and a few hours ago i asked her about him, just to tell me what's going on, then she accused me that i don't trust her, that i was showing off my ego and then started crying and telling me she doesn't want to talk with me..

Too damn cold to be out in the streets, but there’s nowhere for me to lay my head at the moment. At least I have my fix. 15 Xanax bars, 13 Dexedrine, 7 OxyContin, 3 suboxone, a quarter of weed, and a water bottle filled with bottom shelf vodka. That’s all that matters. I could really use some food though. It’s been 2 days since I last ate. 
 
        Under the cover of night I go car to car seeing if any of the doors are unlocked and if any poor sucker left something valuable behind. I get lucky and find $15, half a pack of cigarettes, and a pair of Bluetooth headphones after an hour of searching. Enough for some McDonalds until I can get to the pawn shop to pawn off the headphones. I take another oxy and a swig from my vodka. 

        The cold is getting unbearable. I find a spot to lay down in an abandoned car wash behind a gas station. I light a cigarette and let the familiar warmth of the poppy plant wash over me. Pure bliss. My own little slice of heaven. I put some music on my earbuds and nod off into oblivion, wondering what tomorrow may hold. 

       I wake up to the familiar sound of traffic. The daylight cascades in. I’m still alive. The cars pass by, people on their way to work. On their way to waste their lives away. Slaves to an American dream that never existed. They’ll never taste true freedom. I start off the day with some Dexedrine instead of coffee and some Xanax and weed to take the edge off. I check my phone to see if I can find a ride to the pawn shop and a place to sleep tonight. 

       Waiting on a response, I begin to walk. Snow starts to fall from the gray overcast sky. You’d think this was a town in Eastern Europe the way the winters look. It’s kinda beautiful though, in a gross way. I stumble inside a McDonald’s when the drugs begin to take ahold. People stare at me like I’m a leper, some beast to be afraid of. I don’t give a damn though, we don’t live in the same world. I get my 2 McChickens for the day and slather them with buffalo sauce. I think back on the last time I had a home cooked meal and a feeling of deep despair washes over me for a moment. I wonder what my mother is up to. The thought fades just as soon as a swig of vodka hits my stomach.
    
       A friend of mine texts me and says he can give me a ride to the pawn shop after he gets off work. I’ll be able to score today, so I take some oxy in celebration.

       I pass through the town like a ghost, observing the scenes of the people around me. A group of children wait for their bus on the corner. They laugh and joke and play in the snow. If only they knew how pointless it all was. Just pawns in a sick, stupid game. It’s not their fault though, they’ve been lied to. They’ll see sooner or later.

        At one point or another I guess I took the rest of my Xanax and finished my vodka, because I don’t remember a damn thing from the rest of the day. I wake up on a couch I don’t recognize covered in cuts and bruises. I frantically search my bag to see what the situation is with my stash. Looks like I re upped. A sigh of relief. I take my medicine. I stumble off the couch and come to realize I’m in an old friends house and 2 days have passed. It’s nighttime again. He must be sleeping.

Finished in heavy toasted & lightly charred new oak 

Length of finish: 2 years 

Proof: 90.4

MSRP: $200 / 700 ml

Nose 👃: Maple Nut Goodies. Coffee beans. Prunes. Burnt brown sugar. 

Palate 👅: Dried cranberries. Blueberry pie filling. Cinnamon. Cardamom. Vanilla extract.

Finish 🏁: Coffee beans. Nutmeg. Star anise. Slight ginger.

I understand that many are going to quarrel about the price… and that’s probably a fair conversation. With that said, this is fantastic stuff. I’ve been able to try a couple of batches of this released as Distillery Series in the past and from what my memory recalls, this more widely distributed release is simply better and more balanced. If price wasn’t going to be an issue for many people, this is something everyone is going to want to have in their collection. 

Woodford is releasing a well-balanced bourbon packed with character on both the nose & palate. I respect that people always seem to want higher proof, but the standard 90.4 proof feels perfectly right in this instance. Would I like to try to higher proof? Absolutely. Am I happy at this proof for this release? Absolutely.

Sample provided by Woodford Reserve for review 

The bourbon is good enough to be an 8… definitely more so than previous batches. I’ve seen people snag it for around $170… as opposed to the stated MSRP of $200.  At $170… much more enticing.",9,1737488668.0,bourbon,4,1.0,False

Exercise + sleep + hydrating helps but the pain is still pretty bad (sometimes gotta sleep randomly throughout the day or spend an hour or two not doing anything or massaging my head/neck to offset pain).

Caffeine + ibuprofen + allergy meds help offset the pain temporarily with caffeine giving me the best symptom relief but only lasting two hours while 400mg ibuprofen giving me four hours of symptom relief but the pain is still higher than what my baseline was half a year ago (basically no daily pain besides some mild lethargy and nausea).

Anyways this makes it hard to study or focus anywhere longer than an hour unless I use energy drinks, coffee, meds, or I exercise every time the pain comes (I have to lift like super heavy till absolute muscular failure to offset pain symptoms so not really a possibility of doing it multiple times a day).

We never really fought much before living together and I suspect a lot of this comes from being in close quarters a lot of the time. Things are typically really great but lately we’ve been fights a lot. Most of the time it’s because he does or says something(or doesn’t do something) that hurts me and then he becomes defensive about it. This morning I wanted to go to a local coffee shop(my favorite in the area) and he didn’t really want to go but eventually agreed. A few months ago we were fighting and he was a dick to me in front of the employees there(he apologized since) but now he says it makes him anxious to go in because he feels bad about it. We went in and played checkers while waiting for our order, it was mostly fine but he did seem annoyed with me when I was taking too long to make a move or got distracted by other things. We planned on cleaning the apartment when we got home but I was eating first so I stated this convo
“Are you going to start cleaning or did you want to hang out for a little”
“Idk I need to diffuse my anxiety for a bit first”
“Ok did you want to watch an episode of (show)?”
“No, I’m going to start cleaning(annoyed tone)” 
I got confused and defensive and then he said I wasn’t listening to him and it spiraled from there. He then left to go be alone in our room for a while. A left him alone for 30-45 minutes and then went in to see if we could talk it through(did not work) I would leave it but if I don’t bring things up he just brushes things away and it comes up the next time we argue. I also have memory loss issues so if we don’t hash it out immediately Its hard to have a stance on what happened since I won’t remember details. Most of our fights follow this cycle. I don’t know what to do, I really love him but it’s feeling like doing anything outside the apartment with him is more draining than it’s worth. ",2,1737488214.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

1i6r3k2,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1i6r3k2/help_choosing_beans/,Help choosing beans,"Hello folks, I have what may be an interesting assignment for some of you with more knowledge and experience than I. I could post on a couple other relavent subs, but I believe the people here would have the best set of knowledge and skills to help me out. 

I am a coffee guy. I work at the family business which is essentially a chocolate factory (a small family-owned and run bean-to-bar craft chocolate and confections producer. We make different candies that use chocolate and we make all of our own chocolate to use from fine flavor grade (specialty) single origin cocoa beans. I like to consider myself somewhat knowledgeable and discerning about coffee as in, if I walk into a room, I'm probably the guy who cares more about it than anyone else, but after getting an espresso machine and a Behmor 2000AB this Christmas, I have learned I know absolutely nothing. I have been roasting like a mad man every day and making/drinking 4-5 cups of coffee with all available brew methods to gain a better palate and get the experience I lacked to be able to meaningfully piece together all the information that I had no clue about before when I could just say ""Ah yes a fine Ethiopian Yirgacheffe very nice. Mmm yes 1:16 ratio in my Chemex."" 

Now to the task at hand; sorry for being long-winded. I have been tasked with developing some chocolate covered coffee beans for the business. We have already worked with local roasters in the past for coffee toffee, chocolate covered espresso beans, mocha chocolate bars, etc. We've worked with some really fantastic roasters and some great coffee, but it has never been chosen by a coffee-drinker's palate as my mom, who runs the business, does not drink coffee but knows all about chocolate. I will be roasting the beans myself this time and want to know which sort of profile or origin I should opt for to best pair with our currently available chocolate. 

Our current chocolate includes a very bright, fruity dark chocolate from Ecuador. Sort of red fruit notes that is our staple day to day chocolate. We also have a smoky, almost coffee-like dark chocolate from Nicaragua that is more intense. We make milk chocolate with beans from Semuliki, Uganda that carry really fudgy, classic chocolate notes that just tastes amazing as a milk chocolate. It's silky and delicate as a milk but with as much flavor as you'd expect from a dark chocolate. We recently made a 70% dark chocolate from the Uganda that is just delicious and has us wondering why we haven't done it before. 

I haven't tried any different combos yet, so before I do, does anybody have insight as to what origin/roast level beans I should opt for to find a good pairing? I'm making a Sweet Maria's order today to grab some beans from across the spectrum, but I don't yet know if a dark, smoky chocolate would work best with dark, chocolatey and intense beans, or if I should be aiming to counteract intense dark notes with a fruitier, lighter coffee. On the other hand, we could use a more delicate fruit-forward chocolate like the Ecuadorian one we use as a staple, and I could pair it with darker beans, or very fruity dry process Ethiopian. It'd be nice if we could match countries of origin, but it seems there aren't as many countries as I expected that overlap chocolate and coffee production, at least not from this one site. 

Or do the cupping notes of a coffee not even matter because I'm not going to be brewing them? I know I shouldn't expect very delicate floral jasmine notes when I chew up some beans with my teeth, but would I be able to find a berry-forward dry process Ethiopian where you do get those flavors when chewing the bean, or does it not matter and should I opt for whatever is cheap and just has nothing negative that absolutely clashes with the chocolate it will be covered with?  

TLDR: I am developing chocolate covered coffee beans for the bean-to-bar chocolate producer I am a part of. I will be roasting my own beans for this and I make the chocolate too, as far as sorting, roasting, cracking, winnowing, and dumping in the melanger to be ground down into chocolate. Should I look for coffees that most closely match the notes of the chocolate we will use, or should I look for a more bright/dark relationship like a smoky chocolate and a fruity bean, or a fruity chocolate and a darker bean? Will any delicate coffee notes you can get from cupping and brewing even be relavent when you cover with chocolate and eat the whole bean? I know if you take some chocolate and cover a coffee bean with it it tastes great. But I'm trying to perfect the details that likely nobody but we would notice and make the best specialty single origin craft bean to bar yada yada chocolate covered coffee beans possible, and if there are certain roast profiles, origins, or flavor notes that would pair best with chocolate, what are they are would they be worth it to put that much thought in to? Thank you to anybody who bothered to read this far and know that you will have an impact on what may eventually be a kick-ass product/treat. If anyone gives genuinely helpful advice that ends up producing me some great chocolate covered coffee beans, Ill be happy to send you a bag. ",1,1737488134.0,roasting,2,1.0,False

My caffeine intake was out of control the last few months of 2024 so my starting point was coming off a caffeine bender. Typical day was roughly 80 to 120oz of Coke Zero, an energy drink or two and 8-12 cups of coffee. This started about mid 2023 and just got worse throughout 2024. I was also having frequent headaches throughout 2024.  My original goal was to drop the Coke Zero and energy drinks but now I've decided I'm going caffeine free after what Ive experienced and learned the last few weeks.


So I stopped drinking Coke Zero/ED's on Jan 1st but was still drinking coffee so I figured I could just stop those cold turkey. And things were great for the first three days and I was celebrating stopping and taking my victory lap. 


The morning of the 4th I woke up with the worst headache of my life. I thought I had picked up some bug so I did not relate it to caffeine. And I'd feel better after I got out of bed and had my 2-4 cups of coffee I usually have in the morning. By late afternoon the headache would come back and I'd have more coffee. Still did not relate it to caffeine withdrawal since I was still having my normal coffee amounts.


This headache pattern continued until around the 10th of January, with some days as bad as the first.  I was to the point of desperation and I was scared I had something seriously wrong with me and needed to see a doctor. 


I did some googling and after some time it dawned on me that you can have withdrawal symptoms while still having caffeine. I knew prior to this what caffeine withdrawal was but it was not clear to me that a change in levels could be just as bad as going from say 4 cups a day to zero. Basically I had probably cut my intake in half by dropping the Coke Zero/ED's but I was still drinking 8 cups of coffee a day.


So since I was already having headaches I cut down to 2 cups in the morning and two cups of coffee in the afternoon. The morning headaches got worse days 11 through 16 but after coffee it subsided. I was even more desperate and I thought for sure it was caffeine but this was over two weeks of the worst headaches and I was back to thinking I needed to see a doctor.  


Somewhere in my reading I remembered reading that Caffeine took about 12 hours to clear your body. So I thought maybe if I had a late Coffee around 7pm I would head off the withdrawal symptoms at 7am.


So the first night I measured 8oz of Coffee and had that at 7pm and the next day I woke up headache free, the first time since the 3rd! I thought I might be on to something. The next night I got home late and did not have my 7pm Coffee and the next morning it was one of the worst headaches I have had in those 17 days. I knew that it was withdrawal at that point. 


Since then I've had 6oz at night and in the morning I have 12oz (or basically two cups of coffee). I've been using decaf in the afternoons.  I've been headache free since. Last night I went to 4oz and I was fine. This morning I did the usual 12oz but plan to slowly taper from here until I'm totally caffeine free. 


This last three weeks has been honestly the worst I've ever felt for that length of time. I have zero motivation, depressed and hating life. It has really opened my eyes to caffeine. I'm waiting for my energy and motivation to come back but just being free of headaches is priceless. 


I hope this helps someone avoid the excruciating withdrawal symptoms.",1,1737488097.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

when my new job on campus started he called me and I was like bro I'm busy at a meeting I cant talk; afterwards I spoke to him and he's like I'm outside ur office ( my old one); I told him I switched jobs and I'm busy. I went down to deliver some stuff and left my phone at the meeting. by then he called me 2 times and texted asking if he could by me coffee cause he's in the line. I said no and then blocked him everywhere. After that he kept sending snap requests every few months. I would see him on campus and would avoid him tho he would try talking to me.

He asked me who my roommate is and he would see her at the gym regularly. Then he would try talking to her at the gym.

1i6qyw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i6qyw8/how_i_escaped_the_west_hook_ripper/,How I escaped the West Hook Ripper,"Before you say anything, I know that’s a phony name to give a serial killer.

“West Hook Ripper” sounds like a punchline that didn’t land, but for myself and the people in my town, the name instilled deep, profound terror.

I was in my final year of college when I first heard about it. Or read it, actually. It was on the front page of my city’s main newspaper.

The victim, Sarah, was a student at my college. She was found ripped apart by what the police believed was a hook. She was the seventh body discovered with the same pattern.

A smart-ass journalist gave him the name “West Hook Ripper,” inspired by his weapon of choice and the fact that he targeted the city’s west side, where most universities were.

The panic on campus was indescribable. My boyfriend, Greg, and I participated in many protests demanding better student safety and more action from the authorities. Greg even organized a few; he was head of the student council.

But it didn’t help much.

The last student to disappear was Ananya, a shy Indian grad student in computer science. I used to see her regularly on the bus when we both lived in the same suburban neighborhood, about 70 miles from the city center. We’d chat on the way to class.

I stopped seeing her after I moved out of my parent's house into town with Greg. Her body at the time was yet to be found, so there was hope.

Greg was also in his final year, studying engineering. He had just landed a well-paying job at the airport, where he worked long hours. He was my first real boyfriend, and we were already talking about getting married after I graduated.

We were in his pickup truck the night it happened. The truck was old and smelled bad—his father’s gift to him.

It was late at night, Super Bowl Sunday. We’d had a few beers and accidentally napped at my parent's house. When we woke up, it was past eleven, and I had classes early the next day. We decided to grab some coffee and head home—a stupid decision that my drunk father didn’t contest.

On the drive back, Greg noticed the gas was running low. The station we usually stopped at was closed. A quick Google search pointed us to an open station nearby, but it was along a sketchy side road. Greg said he knew the path and took the entry to it. We had no choice.

The road was desolate and dark, with no other cars or lights. We wondered what kind of gas station would operate in such an isolated place.

It took us fifteen minutes but when we arrived, it was exactly what you’d expect. The station looked abandoned, with faded signs and crumbling walls. The store in it had rows of empty shelves, except for a few Doritos and gum.

We both got out of the truck because I desperately needed to pee. The beers were catching up to me.

The clerk looked like a cliché—a beer-bellied man with a receding hairline. Creepy. 

He didn’t say hi or make eye contact, just sat there reading a magazine.

Greg, in a hurry, told me to use the bathroom quickly. He informed the clerk of the pump number and went outside to fill the tank.

As I walked to the bathroom, I noticed the clerk put down his magazine. He was staring at Greg through the window. Then he turned to me, his gaze lingering.

His look gave me chills. I hurried to the bathroom, did what I had to do, and left as fast as I could.

When I came back, he wasn’t even pretending not to stare. His pale, wide eyes followed me as I got into the truck and told Greg to leave immediately. Luckily, Greg had already paid, and we drove off.

The encounter seemed unsettling but harmless—until we noticed the black SUV. 

It appeared behind us, suddenly. Headlights off, creeping closer. My body tensed in a way it never had before. Greg panicked and floored the gas, pushing the old truck to its limit. We hit nearly 130 mph, but the SUV stayed calmly behind us. Then its high beams flashed on.

The next moments were a blur. I remember seeing other black vehicles joining in. I remember hearing the helicopter. The buzzing. I don’t remember the crash into the cornfield, but I’ll never forget how it felt—my broken nose, my lost tooth.

I woke up covered in blood, still in the truck.

The cops pulled me out and into an ambulance. Greg was gone.

They searched for him for days, using dogs and helicopters. At the time, they found no trace of him, and he is technically still a fugitive.

Later, I learned that part of Ananya’s body was still in the truck bed, wrapped in a sack. The stench wasn’t just from the truck being old. The killer's signature hook was also found in a tool container—stolen from the airport, where he worked.

He had used his position as student council president to earn trust, offering rides to his victims before drugging, assaulting, and murdering them.

The clerk had alerted the police while I was still in the bathroom, recognizing the car as the only one repeatedly seen late at night on that road. I didn’t know at the time that area was Greg’s dumping ground for many of his victims.

For me, the most haunting discovery was under the driver’s seat—a box containing a newly bought wedding ring. A friend of his later told me he would propose to me at my birthday. 

I was inconsolable and confuse for a long, long time. I still don’t understand why he killed those girls and not me. Why I got the ring, and they got the hook.

These are questions I may never have answers to. Or maybe I will. He’s still out there.",4,1737487831.0,nosleep,1,0.83,False

I tried tretinoin , differin, benzoyl peroxide, spirolactine, birth control, cutting out dairy , etc. Three weeks ago, I started a diet which consists of high protein (roughly 100g-150g) and no added sugar. IMMEDIATELY, my skin cleared up. I used to get Dunkin coffee religiously and would eat foods with added sugar. Since January 1, I have not had a new cystic breakout, just one small one during my period. I could cry because nothing else worked; and this solution was in front of me the whole time.

Telling me to be quiet, or that he doesn't want to hear how I changed my order.

I always thought a partner would want to know stuff about me but whenever I would tell him about my day he's just...be annyed and tell me to get to the end.

So he kicked me out a few months ago for a few days. I swore to myself, if he did it again I'd leave.

He told me to stay at my place for my lateshift days, so I packed my shit and left.

He got annoyed about me waking up earlier to get ready in the morning, so he could take his coffee craps in peace...but apparently that annoyed him too.

But I guess it's better this way...for both of us.

Disclaimer: these beans are relatively fresh off the roast, just hit \~2 weeks. I know i should rest them longer, but feels like im WAY off in flavor, so wondering if im doing something else wrong.

I've tried 92C, 95C, right off the boil. Coarser and finer. bloom + 1 pour or 2 pours. 1:15 to 1:17. Draw dows are around 2min excluding 1 min bloom time.

Doesn't matter what I do, im getting a hollow and bitter tasting coffee. So it could just be resting longer. But it feels like more than just that - these coffees are so bad.

So we're at his, he was chilling in bed all morning and I was hopping out and in to make coffee + tea for us, put his laundry on, empty his dishwasher ect.. said i wanted to go to the market for a croissant and wander about like we usually do, and he was like ok but hurry because we booked a roast at x time with his friend..

 I got ready, didn't time myself, probably took a little long, came downstairs and noticed laundry was done but not emptied...  and went to hang out the laundry before we left which he was abit annoyed by, but i thought well he didn't do it, and it was still an hour before we were having lunch anyway..

When in the kitchen emptying the washing machine I spotted my banana I'd brought with me that was browning and impulsively ate it, then went and told him that oh I just ate some banana because it's probably abit late and i want to be healthy anyway,  save money as spent alot day before, do you want something to eat before we go?

He looked pissed and said what why did you eat I'm waiting for you? So I said I know but I just changed my mind so do you want something now there's food in the fridge ect...

 He was so annoyed and said no let's just go takes too long, quicker to get something there, and spent the whole walk to the market getting more and more wound up, I also couldn't walk fast because was wearing too thin tights under my boots and kept sliding in them and that pissed him off as he was matching ahead and then stopping and glaring at me.. 

anyway by the time we got to the market like a 10 min walk he was raging and got so mad he then didn't want to eat anymore, I couldn't see the big deal, he eats alot so if he ate then he would still be hungry for the roast plus if he was so hungry in the morning why not eat a snack whilst I'm getting ready!? 

So I was stubbornly not apologising because he was being so shitty, i felt like i had done nice jobs chores round the house to help him out whilst he was in bed looking at his phone, so I felt fed up then and asked him if he wanted to just go home because he was starting to upset me with his mood and anger and people in the market were eyeing him,  then some guy tried to get past with a massive pram and he muttered ffs and stormed off so I thought he was leaving me, like phew I'll have some nice downtime after the full on day before,  looking round the stalls on my own.. he suddenly pops back up from nowhere accusing me of abandoning him.. 

I'm starting to think he wants me upset and crying to make himself feel better?! 
Like that feeling someone is trying to pull you into something you don't want. 

I don't know what to say and everything i said just made things worse and he'd start talking all over me anyway. 

It was like a child having a temper tantrum. 

He eventually said he wanted to cry and could we talk somewhere quiet but I felt better with people around because he had to keep his shit together (barely) and begrudgingly followed him out of the market and up the road. 

He then went in a rant explaining his feelings and that he wasn't ""losing his temper"" or ""blowing up"" like i said he was but that actually we were ""bickering"" and I needed to apologise even if I didn't mean it. 

I started feeling upset and he then calmed down and then could eat something. 

I felt pissed off underneath because bickering to me is what strangers find funny about silly things, this felt like a huge reaction to something tiny and why did we have to go talk somewhere quiet like it was a big deal..

We had another fall out that night and I went out for a walk with him and told him that I didn't like his temper and we needed to go to couples counselling.
It just felt like it ruined the weekend after a lovely time in the city before and also like as annoying as it can sometimes be having his friend always around wanting to hang out at least he has to be nice to me in front of him because his mate really likes me.
I often feel like I'm annoying him or winding him up or saying the wrong thing and I told him that and he just thinks I have low self esteem?!

I felt like he was hungry and stressed about other stuff and I was just the trigger and ended up being the emotional punching bag which I really don't think is acceptable.
Not the first time he's blown up. 

He's very talkative and can say alot of words and seems to enjoy dominating and arguing whilst I will feel upset and go quiet to control my emotions and struggle to express myself till I'm calm and had time to process what I want to say..
I did say to him you're saying alot of words at me and not listening to me and talking over me and he just said nothing. 

It was really odd and I still don't feel OK about it.

I just want an objective outsider to say AITAH!? Where did i go wrong? Should've I just apologised? What counts as blowing up in a relationship?? ",1,1737487326.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

I’ve been there; being excited about hobonichi. You have viewed all the spreads from minimalistic to colorful, from stamps to stickers and fountain pens to the usage of markers. And you were elated. You couldn’t wait for yours to arrive to replicate, to get your life organized and to help plan your life. You receive the hobonichi planner/journal in any of its forms and start using it… and then you come to the point that things are looking plain. You don’t know what to write about or what to put in it and when you plug in all of your appointments and to-dos… that’s all. You realize that you don’t have much going on in order to fill the planners. You may start to panic or start feeling like you wasted money. 
I’d like to just say that this planner is not just for dates, appointments, and to dos.. It’s more than that. It’s a space to write your thoughts, a quote, the fact that you went to get coffee and what you got, something you heard on tv, an emotion written as a word or a blurb, a confession, something you’re looking forward to. A sketch can fill a space, a picture, a magazine clipping, a sticker. Hobonichi is about creativity. Do not be afraid of making mistakes. There should be no mistakes. And do not have the expectancy that things should be totally aligned and perfect (I know that online spreads make us feel that things need to be neat). I guess I wrote this to give an idea that you can put and do anything with your hobonichi. I wrote this for those who feels stuck about what should be in their hobonichi when their lives are not as busy as they thought. Also, if you want your hobonichi to only reflect appointments and dates, that’s okay! I see posts sometimes of others not sure what to put in their hobonichi.

Im going to preface with my mom has been horrible to me. But it goes on both ends of the spectrum. When she’s an angel, I give her credit, she is an angel. But she can be satan himself. 

One of the worst things she’s done aside from regularly hitting me (for stuff as menial as bad grades) was asking me if I had been a w*ore since I was 9 when I told her a family member sa’d me.

Growing up recently, I’ve become very aware of different types of relationships and healthy dynamics. I know my mom is likely a narcissist. But my edad who I used to LOVE because he wasn’t as volatile has never really treated her well. 

He used to make comments in front of us about stuff like her weight. I knew it really wore on her but she projected so much on me that I got an ED. 

Anyway. I don’t visit too often anymore but when I do, I try to do something really really nice for my mom that I know she’ll appreciate. She did take care of me, and my dad taught me to be the “handyman” of the house (I’m an f25), so I go out of my way to plant flowers for her or do repairs around her house while my dad is away for work. 

She gets lonely. And if we can’t have a mother daughter relationship then I’m okay with trying to be friends. Sometimes I leave her notes about how beautiful she is and how smart I think she is. 

When I visit I even wake up earlier than her to make her coffee for work and put her lunchbox together. 

I don’t think she’s really used to any of that. I don’t know what the world did to my mom before she had me. She had VERY extreme ideations that she would shove on me growing up.

But seeing how happy she gets when I do little things for her, how she tells me she looks at the flowers I planted for her and she misses me makes me tear up.

It’s all I’ve ever wanted for us. Now I almost get too sad to leave. Last time I visited I took her to the archery range (I wanted to show her my hobbies) and we hung out alone over dinner for the first time in my entire life. 

There are other factors, of course, like she got her thyroid removed. I’m certain that’s contributing, but I’ve seen how lonely she is and I think I can be a friend.

Service connection may be granted for a disability which began in military service or was caused by some event or experience in service. (38 CFR 3.303) A direct grant of service connection requires: 1) medical evidence of a current disability, 2) evidence of the incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in active military service, and 3) medical evidence of a nexus (link) between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. (38 CFR 3.303, 38 CFR 3.304) Your service treatment records do not contain complaints, treatment, or diagnosis for this condition.

Service connection may be granted for a condition diagnosed after military discharge provided evidence establishes that the condition was caused by service. Service connection may be granted on this basis for a disability related to toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) during military service if evidence demonstrates that the Veteran was actually exposed in service and that a disease associated with such exposure resulted. (38 CFR 3.303, 38 CFR 3.304) We considered whether your condition resulted from a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) in service. (38 U.S.C. 1168, 38 U.S.C. 1710(e)(4)) The evidence of record shows participation in a TERA. We requested an examination with medical opinion based on toxic exposure risk activity (TERA). Although the evidence of record shows participation in a TERA, the medical opinion provided by the examiner does not show an association between your claimed disability and in- service TERA. (38 U.S.C. 1168, 38 CFR 3.303) The VA medical opinion found no link between your diagnosed medical condition and military service. The VA medical examiner opined: The claimed condition is less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activity(ies), after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the veteran. The veteran has a diagnosed gastro esophageal reflux disorder of GERD. Symptoms that the veteran has been experiencing as listed on examination are classic symptoms of this disease: heartburn, chest pain, dysphagia, and regurgitation. According to Epocrates (2019) ""The lower esophageal sphincter regulates food passage from the esophagus to the stomach and contains both intrinsic smooth muscle and skeletal muscle. Episodes of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation are a normal phenomenon, but they occur more frequently in GERD, causing reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation is more common after meals and is stimulated by fat in the duodenum. It is more likely to occur if there is a hiatal sac containing acid."" So therefore, the veteran has a disease with a clear with specific etiologies. According to Taraszewsk (2021) ""Risk factors of this condition include: excessive body weight, particularly obesity, moderate/high alcohol consumption, smoking, postprandial and vigorous physical activity, as well as lack of regular physical activity. Lifestyle risk factors that may contribute to GERD symptoms include excessive body weight, particularly obesity, moderate/high alcohol consumption, smoking, postprandial and vigorous physical activity, as well as lack of regular physical activity. Many studies indicate fatty, fried, sour, spicy food/products, orange and grapefruit juice, tomatoes and tomato preserves, chocolate, coffee/tea, carbonated beverages, alcohol as triggers for GERD symptoms. Eating habits such as irregular meal pattern, large volume of meals, eating meals just before bedtime may correlate with the symptoms of GERD "" There is no medical or scientific evidence available that provides any indication of a relationship between the development of the condition(s) at issue and the TERA. There is no basis in the available evidence of record to establish service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease. This condition did not happen in military service, nor was it aggravated or caused by service. (38 CFR 3.303, 38 CFR 3.304, 38 CFR 3.306)

Service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease is denied since this condition neither occurred in nor was caused by service. (38 CFR 3.303, 38 CFR 3.304) Favorable Findings identified in this decision: You have been diagnosed with a disability. VA medical examination dated February 21, 2024, confirms a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Participation in a toxic exposure risk activity is conceded. TERA is conceded due to service in the Southwest Asia Theater of Operations.

Nothing came out, zero, nada.

Dialed the grind setting up to 2.0, same story.

At 3.0, it took 13 seconds to start flowing, and stopped quickly, less than 20mL of espresso out on a double shot (didn't taste bad though).

At a grind setting of 4.5 it's starting the flow within a reasonable time, but brewing pretty quickly and only gave me 34mL of espresso on a double shot...

I don't THINK I'm tamping it into a rock solid concretion... 40 lbs of recommended pressure seems like a lot... I'm tamping firmly, but it's not as if I'm straining at all.

What should my process be to dial this in? Should I be using a calibrated tamper?

If I dial it in for double shots, should I always brew double shots?

Do I have to re-do this every time I switch brands of coffee?

1i6qk3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1i6qk3h/hm_saras_encampment/,[HM] Sara's Encampment,"Friday afternoon, without any warning, twenty-three-year-old Sara Ortiz made an encampment in her family’s backyard.

It had to be done.

In the last three months, her father Javier had not read a single one of the articles she emailed to his inbox. Her mother Regina had not listened to the illuminating podcasts air dropped to her phone. When she shared a series of perfectly succinct Twitter posts on the family text thread, Mr. and Mrs. Ortiz had the gall to turn off their read receipts. No matter how hard Sara tried to get through to her Gen X parents, they continued to cling to an opinion she found morally loathsome: that the CBS series *Elsbeth* was the best show on television.

Sara decided to set up the family tent on the square patch of grass between the patio table and the barbecue. It was a prime spot, easily visible from her parents’ bedroom and still close enough to the house to connect to the good wi-fi in the den.

Regina had just returned from the grocery store when she heard a repetitive banging coming from outside. She followed the noise to the window and saw her daughter, N95 cinched tightly around her face, sitting cross-legged in the tent and hitting a metal pan with a wooden spoon. Upon seeing her mother, she began to chant:

***Not that edgy. Hardly funny. CBS is stealing your money!***

Javier, ice packs on his knees from a twelve-hour day of having to lay laminate flooring because one of his employees didn’t show, limped from the bed and joined his wife at the window.

***Poor directing. Crappy lighting. Worst of all — the bad writing!***

“Isn’t that your favorite saucepan?” Javier asked.

Regina’s eyes narrowed. She could handle a little criticism of their favorite CBS show but taking her pan—on enchilada night no less—was a call to arms.

She marched outside to retrieve her cookware but was instead handed a list of demands scrawled on a piece of cardboard.

**ENCAMPMENT DEMANDS -- (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**

1. You will CEASE watching *Elsbeth* IMMEDIATELY!
2. You will STOP financially supporting CBS, Paramount+, and all other platforms that currently show *Elsbeth* either live or on demand.
3. You will STOP casually mentioning that *Elsbeth* is “a real hoot” which is SO OBVIOUSLY WRONG by all standards!!!!

Javier and Regina didn’t pretend to be experts on television. They only had time to watch a few hours a week: a soccer game here and there, the occasional *Seinfeld* rerun, and now *Elsbeth*. Unlike other crime shows, they liked how there was no mystery about “whodunnit,” the fun of the show was watching Elsbeth prove the experts around her wrong as she unraveled the case piece by piece.

“Let’s just wait her out,” Javier said.

And so they did. Regina used her backup saucepan for the enchiladas, then she and Javier ate dinner while re-watching last week’s episode with the volume all the way up. It was a lovely evening.

They had forgotten about Sara’s protest until they heard screams coming from the backyard shortly after sunrise. They peered out the bedroom window to see the sprinklers were on and drenching her tent. Sara’s head popped out for a moment, just long enough for her to yell “SHAME!” in their direction before she disappeared back inside.

Sara saw the weaponization of the sprinklers as another blatant disregard for her feelings. The fact that two people who claimed to “love” her would ignore her reasonable demands and *then* go about their morning knowing their child was shivering to death in sixty-five degree weather was, in a word, traumatic.

In truth, Regina and Javier *were* worried about Sara. They had been worried about her for years. Growing up they loved watching TV together. They were fans of *Suits* before it was cool to be a fan of *Suits*. They mixed in a bit of reality TV too, classics like *American Idol* and *The Amazing Race*. But things started to change during college. When Sara came home from her first winter break, she refused to watch the *Survivor* finale but made them all endure a seven-part documentary in Portuguese about the history of the South American labor movement. That was the first warning sign.

Soon after this, Sara created her own Netflix profile and populated it with shows Javier couldn’t believe anyone other than his daughter was actually watching. Her favorite was a Scandinavian series where people make art out of non-recyclable plastics. She turned down a summer job in the hopes of launching her own garbage art business but only succeeded in procuring a skin rash that had to be remedied with a six hundred dollar prescription steroid.

Regina and Javier were optimistic that the trajectory of Sara’s life would change after graduation. But upon returning home, she announced that, given the perilous state of the planet, there was no longer any value in pursuing a career in pediatric nursing as previously planned and she would instead focus on the important work of composting all of the Ortiz family’s food waste. That was two years ago.

When *Elsbeth* premiered last February, Regina and Javier hoped that the quirky lead character mixed with old-fashioned crime-solving would be the perfect blend of harmless elements to bring their splintered family back together. Sara agreed to watch the first episode with them.

When lead character Elsbeth Tascioni first appeared on screen, riding on top of a New York City tour bus with a smile on her face and a Lady Liberty foam crown on her head, Sara groaned and muttered something about “capitalist agitprop.” When Regina laughed at Elsbeth’s multiple tote bags and wondered out loud what in the world she kept in each of them, Sara accused the show’s creators, Robert and Michelle King, of “glorifying the commercial excesses of Western civilization.” And when Javier said his favorite character was the deadpan police captain who has to put up with all of Elsbeth’s wacky behavior, Sara called Captain Wagner “a useful pawn for power brokers like Elsbeth, whose secret agenda wasn’t to solve crimes or expose corruption but to cement her standing in elite New York society.” Sara wasn’t invited to watch episode two.

As the protest entered Day 2 and the spring temperatures popped to seventy degrees, Sara’s situation was growing dire. She was not about to drink unfiltered water from the garden hose and her Nalgene bottle was almost empty. She estimated she would be dead within a few hours.

“Is she moaning?” Javier asked over breakfast.

Regina paused to listen.

“Yes,” she said.

“Do you think she’s okay?”

Javier already knew the answer to that question. His daughter wasn’t okay. She used to be happy. She used to have friends. She went to high school dances. She played the clarinet. She dreamed of becoming a nurse and falling in love and someday being a mom who made delicious enchiladas just like Regina. As much as Javier had been told this word was problematic, Sara used to be… normal.

What Javier and Regina didn’t know is *why* she changed. That was the real mystery. If only they could figure that out. If only they had Elsbeth here to look at all the evidence. To help them piece together where things went wrong. To show them “whodunnit.” Then maybe they could undo it. Maybe they could save her. Maybe.

Javier looked up from his coffee and into Regina’s worried eyes. “You want to help me solve a mystery?” he asked. Her eyes welled up. She definitely did.

They let themselves into Sara’s bedroom. They didn’t go in there much anymore, mostly because Sara rarely ventured outside it. The room was bright. Cheery. Regina ran her hands over a stuffed Minnie Mouse they bought Sara on a childhood trip to Disney World. Javier found a drawer filled with notes and cards they’d given to her over the years, an endless parade of love and affirmation. Regina leafed through a scrapbook Sara made near the end of high school, page after page of photos and keepsakes edged in glitter pens and stickers and hearts.

They sat on their daughter’s bed. Silent. They didn’t have a clue where things had gone sideways. They loved Sara unconditionally. They took her on vacations to places they couldn’t afford. They insulated her from every known hazard. In first grade when Sara claimed her polyester school uniform made her itchy, Regina special ordered a cotton one. When Sara claimed she was still itchy, they switched schools. The day Sara’s knobtail gecko HoHo died and Sara hyperventilated until she passed out, Javier left work and drove two states away to bring home a matching knobtail gecko.

For twenty-three years, they gave Sara everything a child could ever want or need or dream.

“We worshipped that girl,” Regina said.

The second she said it, she heard it. So did Javier. They locked eyes and shared a look they knew quite well—the look Elsbeth gives Officer Blanke when an uncrackable case suddenly makes perfect sense.

“Oh dear,” Regina realized.

There was nothing more to be said. Javier wrote out their responses to Sara’s demands on her piece of cardboard and delivered it to her tent:

ENCAMPMENT DEMANDS -- (NON-NEGOTIABLE):

1. You will CEASE watching *Elsbeth* IMMEDIATELY! **(no)**
2. You will STOP financially supporting CBS, Paramount+, and all other platforms that currently show *Elsbeth* either live or on demand. **(no)**
3. You will STOP casually mentioning that *Elsbeth* is “a real hoot” which is SO OBVIOUSLY WRONG by all standards!!!! **(it is a real hoot)**

They spent the rest of the day cleaning out Sara’s room. One by one they brought the boxes to the yard and placed them in front of the zipped up tent. By the time they were done, they couldn’t even see the encampment or hear Sara’s moaning.

They stood in Sara’s empty room and looked out at the backyard with a mix of regret and hope. Regret that they failed to prepare her for the real world. For differing opinions. For the reality of not always getting what you want. But also with the hope that by pushing her out, she might still become the healthy adult they always dreamed their beautiful daughter could be.

On Sunday morning, a U-Haul backed up to the Ortiz house. Sara and a stranger she’d met online named Tick loaded the boxes into the truck and were gone by lunch. All that was left behind was the tent and, in the far corner of the yard, near the compost bin, a few piles of poop.",1,1737486807.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1i6qih2,https://www.reddit.com/r/movingprofessionals/comments/1i6qih2/the_ultimate_premove_checklist/,The Ultimate Pre-Move Checklist 🏠🚛”,"Hey, Moving Day Warriors! 👋

After a combined 5+ years of moving, we’ve seen it all: the smooth moves and the “wish-we-planned-this-better” nightmares. To help you avoid unnecessary stress (and save money), here’s my ultimate list of tips for clients to prep like a pro **before the movers arrive**.

Save this list, share it with friends, and let me know in the comments if I missed any gems! 💡👇

**p.s.** professional movers reading this, don't leave just yet!! There might be some great tips you can make use of, if not, share this checklist with clients before a move to make moving day that much easier!1

# 1. Declutter Before You Pack 🗑️

Moving things you don’t need costs you time and money. Here’s how to downsize:

* **Donate**: Clothes, furniture, and items in good condition.
* **Sell**: Use Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, or a garage sale.
* **Trash**: Be ruthless—if you haven’t used it in 2+ years, let it go.

# 2. Pack Strategically 📦

Packing doesn’t have to be chaos if you do it right:

* **Label Everything Clearly** 🏷️: Write the room name and a brief description (e.g., “Kitchen - Plates & Glasses”).
* **Color Code with Tape** 🎨: Use colored tape or stickers for each room. Movers will love you for this!
* **Pack an Essentials Box** 🛠️: Include items you’ll need immediately—think toiletries, chargers, snacks, and a change of clothes.

# 3. Protect Your Valuables 💎

Keep important items with you, not on the truck:

* Jewelry, passports, cash, and personal documents.
* Laptops, tablets, and sentimental items. Pro Tip: Take photos of electronics and fragile items in case of damage (better safe than sorry).

# 4. Prep Your Home for Moving Day 🏡

Make it easy for movers to do their job:

* **Clear a Path** 🚪: Move rugs, cords, and clutter out of the way.
* **Reserve Parking** 🅿️: If possible, secure a spot close to your door.
* **Protect Floors and Walls** 🎨: Lay down mats or cardboard and use corner guards for tight spaces.

# 5. Communicate with Your Movers 📞

The best moves happen when clients and movers are on the same page:

* **Confirm Arrival Time**: Call your movers the day before to confirm the schedule.
* **Share Special Instructions**: Have an oversized item? A fragile antique? Let them know upfront.
* **Ask About Disassembly**: Will they take apart beds or furniture, or do you need to do it yourself?

**6. Food and Fridge Prep** 🥶

* **Defrost Your Freezer**: Do this 24-48 hours before moving day.
* **Plan Meals**: Pack a cooler with snacks, drinks, and easy-to-eat meals for the big day.

# 7. Pack a Personal ""First Night Kit"" 🌙

When the truck pulls away, you’ll want these items handy:

* Pajamas, bedding, and basic toiletries.
* Phone chargers, a flashlight, and basic cleaning supplies.
* Coffee maker or kettle—trust me, you’ll thank yourself in the morning!

# 8. Kids & Pets? Plan Ahead! 🐾

Moving day can be chaotic for little ones and furry friends:

* **Kids**: Arrange a sitter or have activities ready to keep them occupied.
* **Pets**: Secure them in a quiet room or with a trusted friend to avoid accidents.

# 9. Take Care of Utilities & Services 🔌

Don’t forget to:

* **Transfer Utilities**: Set up electricity, water, and internet at your new place.
* **Forward Mail**: Update your address with USPS, banks, and subscriptions.
* **Cancel Subscriptions**: End services like lawn care or cleaning at your old place.

# 10. Don’t Forget to Say Goodbye ❤️

Take a moment to walk through your home and double-check everything. It’s also a great opportunity to snap one last photo of your old space before you head off to your next adventure.

**BONUS TIP:**  
Start early. Packing always takes longer than you think—don’t wait until the last minute!

Even though you can't give medical advice, I guess you've probably learned a lot through all the hardship and challenges, so any tips would be much appreciated! If not, I hope someone can find comfort in knowing they're not alone on this journey.

So, since I was a kid, I had some bellyaches and discomfort every morning. But then I cut out coffee, and things got better—they didn’t bother me again.
However, since last year, things have gotten a lot worse (especially after a round of antifungals for a mycosis, but I guess that was just a coincidence). Every morning, I’ve been having yellow, soft stools, followed by bellyaches and cramps that make me really uncomfortable. Some days, I have to go to the bathroom 4 times in a row and still don’t feel relief. This is particularly bothersome during class, where I can’t really pay attention to the lesson or anything else because my belly is screaming in agony. This year I’m going to university, and if this pain doesn’t improve, I honestly don’t know how I’m going to get through it.

Here’s everything I’ve done and tried based on my own research and my doctor’s advice:

Ultrasound, bloodwork, stool tests:

Ultrasound came back normal.

Bloodwork came back normal but showed high bilirubin (Gilbert's Syndrome).

Stool tests showed undigested fat and protein in the stool but were mostly normal.


Low FODMAP diet: This diminished gas a bit but didn’t help with the soft yellow stools or pain.

Cut out different foods: I tried cutting out dairy, gluten, eggs, bananas, peanut butter, oats—everything, honestly, lol.

Digestive enzymes: These gave me diarrhea, but I’m guessing it’s because of the bile salts in them.

Probiotics

Metamucil

Imodium: I tried taking it once every night—it didn’t work. I tried once every morning—still didn’t work. I kept having yellow, soft stools and pain.

Antispasmodics

I’ve already been meditating, exercising, sleeping well, and eating clean for a couple of years, so I guess my mental health is fine, but this IBS thing is throwing it off a bit 🥴 (I also don’t drink or do drugs).


So yeah, I honestly don’t know what else to do. If you guys have any advice, tips, or even words of encouragement, it would mean a lot. Thanks! ❤️

Our friendships mostly existed with each other though. 90% of the time I saw Jill, I also saw Jack. We would all see each other at least once a week for dinner together. Jack and Jill were best friends for a while before I joined their dynamic, and they were definitely the best friends out of the group. They also have lived together for about a year now. 

For a few months, Jill has been experiencing some interpersonal struggles with Jack, which they have been sharing with me. In my opinion, all of these problems were 100% on Jack. Stuff like Jack putting her in unsafe situations, making fun of her trauma, telling Jill that he wants alone time and then going out with other friends. Through all of this, Jill has remained friends with Jack and has been making huge efforts to repair the relationship. And it seemed like Jack was trying too. I mean, he literally went to therapy with her to safety plan with her therapist to be on suicide watch for her.  

A few days ago, Jill and I were forced to overhear a conversation between Jack and another roommate where they spent about thirty minutes discussing how awful and terrible Jill is. Saying degrading, untruthful stuff. And we also find out that Jack has been lying to Jill for months about liking them, and he spoke about how exhausting it is to pretend to be friends with her. 

Jill was an absolute mess after this- she has borderline and just awful mental illness in general. So we went to a coffee shop and she journaled for about an hour until she was ready to talk about it. She basically just said she was hurt and didn’t know where to go from here, but wanted to have a roommate meeting. She never asked my opinion, for me to pick a side or anything. 

But after hearing Jack speak like that about Jill, and knowing that he’s capable of lying like that, I feel like I can’t be friends with him anymore. He’s reached out and I finally explained why, and he’s saying that I’m overreacting and that it has nothing to do with me. That he likes me just fine and doesn’t understand what my problem is.  I talked to Jill about it and she says my friendships are my friendships and she’s just happy that I don’t hate her

I have a good group of friends that I went to school with and have met over the years, but am looking to expand my social circle, even if that means doing so virtually. 

My current hobbies include cooking from home (also my job), lino-cut stamps, embroidery, and making zines. I love to be creative and consume creative media (movies, books, comics, and creatives on instagram and TikTok). I am also an amateur photographer! I do it mostly as a hobby, and love to work with digital, film, and Polaroid. 

I also love to write postcards and letters. I’ve sent and recorded over 100 postcards to/from around the world through the website Postcrossing, and while have not maintained a recurring penpal, also enjoy writing to anyone who wants a letter. So if that interests you eventually, I would love to start that! 

In my spare time I enjoy going to the gym and hanging out at coffee shops, either writing or just enjoying the scenes around me.

I am mainly looking for someone to share bits of their life with, and hear about mine. I’m into hearing about every aspect of your life, from friendship and gossip, to your love life and the cool animal you saw on your walk, or cup of coffee you had.

""Allow me to introduce myself.""

""What?""

""We are meeting for the first time, are we not?""

""I... I guess...""

""Therefore it would only seem fitting that we exchange names and shake hands, would it not?""

""Oh... okay...""

""Yes. So allow me to introduce myself. I'm Grump.""

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It was a name I'd never heard before. And he shared it with such confidence! I wouldn't have been surprised if he'd introduced himself hundreds of times before. To all sorts of people.

But something seemed wrong. And that something was... was...

""Grump? What kind of a name is Grump!?""

""Ah. I thought this might happen.""

""Might... happen?""

""You see, it is not at all uncommon in many circles for somebody to use something other than their actual name. If your name were something embarrassing, like Eunice or Belcher, it wouldn't do to have social interactions starting off on a bad foot simply because of the name you introduce yourself with. Furthermore, there are several reasons why one may decide to use a name other than their own.""

""W-what?...""

""Say, for example, that you have a very old group of friends, with many shared experiences. They might use what is called a nickname when talking to you.""

""A nickname? I think I've heard of that.""

""Furthermore, when you have a public persona, for example as an entertainer, you may decide to use a stage name when engaging with the public. Grump is just an example of such a name. And it is not the only one used on my show.""

I was surprised. No, not just surprised. Dumbfounded. Flabbergasted. Addled. Borderline nonverbal. Not only was this man prepared to admit that he hadn't used his real name when speaking to me earlier, but he had told me that he was using a stage name. And not only one stage name, but two. I could barely speak.

""Two... two stage names?""

""Of course, it isn't for myself.""

""W-what isn't?""

""The second stage name.""

""Oh, I think I'm understanding. There must be... be another person on your show!""

""Now you're getting it. Now allow me to introduce my cohost, Not-So-Grump.""

""Not-So-Grump?""

""Yes.""

A second man had approached. One entirely different from the first man. Two new people. Two new faces. Two faces. Two revelations. Two fears.

Something was sticking with me. I couldn't quite figure out what it was, but something wasn't adding up. Here this one man was Grump, and this other man Not-So-Grump, and yet...

""You're probably wondering why we've chosen these names.""

""Ch... chosen?""

""Yes. You see, when you run a show, as demonstrably both of us do, there is a need for a theme.""

""A theme?""

""Yes. For example, many morning radio shows have a character given the name of an animal. This is an important signifier of the theme of their show. They are attempting to indicate that their show has an irreverent, offbeat tone.""

""That makes sense.""

""In our case, the theme is 'Grump.' Quite a simple theme, wouldn't you agree? Grump. One simple syllable. And yet, it encompasses such a breadth of human emotion.""

""Emotion?""

""Yes. Think for example of the last time you were grumpy. You had perhaps gotten a poor amount of sleep, and perhaps you hadn't yet had your coffee that morning. Perhaps you had family trouble or a pain in your neck. And you were grumpy. You carried that throughout your day, did you not? At the breakfast table, you were grumpy. Later, dealing with other, you were grumpy. And in some contexts you may have tried to hide it, but with your true friends, you knew there was no need to hide such a silly frivolous emotion. In point of fact, a 'mere word' like Grump contains all of the mysteries of human experience, human existence. And its inverse, Not-So-Grump! The yin and yang of life, of emotion, of being itself!""

This was all too much for me.

""Why... why are you telling me this?""

""Because together... we are the Game Grumps!""

""Whaaaaat?""

""And that begs one very simple conclusion, does it not? But just so that we're absolutely sure we understand, let's go over everything we've just discussed, from the beginning...""",23,1737485346.0,gamegrumps,5,0.96,False

As if stepping into a vision, my eyes opened, and I found my hands gripping the wheel of a filthy cab. The cracked leather seats were worn and stained, seemingly from years of neglect. The car reeked of stale coffee and some sort of strong, chemical stench that burned my nostrils.

The headlights pierced the darkness as I pulled up to an apartment stoop at a dimly lit street corner. Panic gripped me as I realized I was driving, but the horrifying truth became clear… I wasn’t in control. My hands moved on their own, like I was trapped in a cutscene from a first-person video game, helpless to do anything but watch as the scene played out.

I turned to my reflection in the rearview mirror. The face staring back at me wasn’t mine at all. It was grotesque and unkempt, with sunken eyes, a scruffy beard, and a foul grin. He wore a jet-black flat cap and a tattered peacoat, his expression cold and calculating. Looking into those horrible eyes, I realized this was no ordinary cab driver. He was a monster, prowling the shadowy streets, waiting for his next helpless victim.

I stepped out of the car, the air heavy and damp, as if an impending storm were brewing nearby. I slowly circled the rusty, beat-up 1989 Ford Crown Victoria, its paint peeling like flakes of dried skin. The smell of cheap gasoline mingled with the humid night air. As I rounded the back, I stopped dead in my tracks at the sight of the vanity license plate: CABMAN. My heart sank into my stomach, but before I could fully grasp what I was seeing, I found myself walking up the steps of the darkened stoop and knocking on the door.

I knocked again, searching my surroundings for any signs of life. There was no answer, just the sound of leaves rustling as the wind picked up. Reaching for the handle, I found the door was locked. After looking around once more, I began fidgeting with the lock. I’d never tried to break into a house before, but I could tell in my current state that I had done this before. Even so, my attempts were futile.

I returned to the car, every step I took was not my own, my mind pleaded for control as I opened the trunk; my eyes once again drawn to the haunting license plate. Inside, the trunk was lined with old newspapers dated September 14th, 1999. On top of the faded pages were a few feet of rope, a crowbar, and a plastic bag containing what looked like duct tape and pruning shears. My hand lingered over the bag for a moment, but I grabbed the crowbar instead and headed back to the door.

This time, I wedged the flat end of the crowbar between the door frame and the door, prying it open to create a gap. Rocking the crowbar back and forth, I was able to widen the opening. Without hesitation, my body slammed into the door, lurching back as the force hurled splintered pieces of wood and caused the latch or bolt mechanism to break. The hinges creaked as the door swung open, revealing nothing but blackness. I peered inside, nervously awaiting what might lie ahead, the crowbar heavy in my hand. A small bit of light crept in from outside as I stepped through the door into a hallway next to some stairs. My mind continued to fight against the involuntary movements I made, trying to comprehend the horrific details of what led me here, unsure about the house, but this body moved with eerie familiarity.

In the silence, I heard the faint creaking of footsteps on old floorboards coming from somewhere upstairs. Flashes of memories began to flood my mind, a young girl’s terrified face, her desperate pleas for mercy, and the tension-fueled resolve that had driven me to this very house. I could feel the sinister intentions that Cabman had in mind, leaving me both disgusted and entranced.

The memories became clearer, solidifying in my mind with vivid detail. I saw myself driving that filthy cab late at night, the dense fog made it hard to see anything beyond the headlights. A dilapidated signpost appeared through the haze; the faded lettering spelled out 'Service Road.' Instinctively, I pulled onto the broken pavement, the tires crunching against loose gravel. A woman’s voice broke the silence from the backseat, her tone filled with agitation. “This isn’t the right way… I said Hamilton Avenue!” she protested. “This way is quicker,” I slurred, my tone flat, devoid of any real emotion. “There was an accident up the road when I dropped someone off earlier.” It felt strange as the words escaped my lips, my mouth moved, but I wasn’t in control of what was said. The voice didn’t belong to me, yet it came from my mouth, I was still trapped watching through Cabman’s eyes.

The car continued down the desolate road, the woman’s protests growing more forceful. My body remained rigid, moving robotically as I blindly followed the twisting path. We rounded a sharp curve and neared the edge of a massive ravine, where only a rickety, old guardrail stood between us and the jagged rocks below.

The car slowed to a halt at the cliff’s edge, the idling engine and the distant chirp of crickets were the only sounds breaking through the silence. A wave of fear washed over me as I felt the evil intentions of Cabman’s heart rising within me. The woman’s voice trembled as she asked, “Why are we stopping here?” I remained silent, ignoring her question as my hand moved to the door handle. I stepped out of the cab, moving with a purpose that wasn’t my own. I knew exactly where I was headed, feeling myself being pulled to the trunk. My thoughts flashed to the pruning shears I’d seen earlier, and everything was starting to make sense.

The trunk lid opened, revealing the rope and the plastic bag with the duct tape and pruning shears. There was no sign of the crowbar, but the scene was eerily familiar. I grabbed the rope and pruning shears, then walked back to the rear car door. As I approached, the woman shoved the door open, slamming it into me as she scrambled out of the car.

“What is going on!?” she screamed hysterically. “What are you doing back here?”

I remained silent, my body moving towards her with a relentless determination. She backed away, her chest heaving with each panicked breath. Wrapping the rope around my left arm, I picked up my pace, narrowing the distance between us.

I pulled the pruning shears from the bag, gripping them tightly in my right hand. She turned to run, her panicked breaths turning into shallow gasps.

“Stay back!” she shouted, her voice trembling with fear.

My body didn’t stop. Words that weren’t mine spilled from my mouth. “Give me your money and anything valuable, and I won’t have to hurt you.”

She clutched her bag tighter, shaking her head. “Stay away from me! Please, just let me go!”

I lunged forward, feeling Cabman’s excitement at the chance to fight. I grabbed at her arm, swinging the shears violently. She screamed, twisting to break free from my grasp, but in the struggle, the shears plunged into her forearm, leaving a shallow cut but nothing that would be fatal. She shrieked in pain, clutching the wound as tears streamed down her face.

“Give me the bag!” I barked, holding the shears up. The words felt foreign, as though Cabman’s will was speaking through me.

She shuddered, reaching for the wound to stop the bleeding. While she was preoccupied, I reached for her purse again, but she twisted to avoid my advances. Still gripping her arm, I forced her to the ground. She cried out, struggling against me. My hand, moving on its own, grabbed her left hand and lifted the shears. A large, luminous engagement ring adorned her finger, the expensive diamond gemstone glittering even in the low light with each desperate move of her hand.

“I’ll happily take this ring instead!” I hissed. Her sobbing grew louder as she writhed beneath me. “Do you want to lose a finger!?”

“Please, stop… please!” she begged, her voice cracking.

I could feel her squirming and twisting beneath me, kicking her feet violently in an attempt to break free. As she bucked, one of her legs slipped free. She pulled it into her chest and kicked with all her remaining strength, hitting me hard in the chest. I felt the breath leave my lungs as I fell back, the shears slipping from my grasp. She scrambled to her feet, holding her bleeding arm, and fleeing toward the tree line.

Seemingly unfazed, I stumbled after her, the rope still in my grip. The fog was thick, but I could hear her desperate sobs and the pounding of her footsteps. She ran, trembling, into the woods near the guardrail, disappearing into the darkness. I pursued her relentlessly, adrenaline fueling my every step as I struggled to regain my breath.

The woods were completely shrouded in darkness from the thick fog. I turned and caught a faint glimpse of the cab’s headlights, barely cutting through the dense haze several yards away. The rustling of leaves and the crunch of the woman’s frantic footsteps echoed through the trees, disorienting me. I tripped on a fallen tree branch and tumbled down the hill. As I struggled to my feet, my pulse pounding in my ears, I spotted the forest’s edge and a clearing leading to the main road.

Suddenly, she burst out from behind a tree, hurling herself off the embankment toward the road below. I stumbled after her, Cabman’s rage fueling every step. In the distance, I heard a car engine approaching. I knew I only had seconds to act, and I could feel the dreadful panic that consumed Cabman as if it were my own. Instinctively, I pulled the rope from around my arm and hurled it toward the fleeing woman. It struck her, wrapping around her shoulder and causing her to waver, yet she managed to stay upright. I yanked hard, trying to drag her down, reeling in the rope and tightening it toward her throat. She pushed back against it in a desperate attempt to free herself, but I closed the distance, wrapping my arms around her waist as she struggled.

Headlights sliced through the fog, burning into my eye sockets like two stars exploding in the night sky. Blinded and disoriented, I froze for a moment in the beam’s reflection. She wasted no time, lunging back against me, forcing me to release my grip and propelling herself out of the car’s path. The car drew closer, and the headlights grew brighter, searing into my vision. I didn’t have the time or perception to brace for the impact. The car hit me with such intense force that it sent me flying. I landed hard on the cold pavement, my eyes shutting as the world around me dissolved. When I opened them, I was back in the house I’d been breaking into, still trapped in Cabman’s body.",2,1737485303.0,nosleep,1,0.75,False

1i6pumn,https://www.reddit.com/r/DryJanuary/comments/1i6pumn/caffeine_and_im_still_me/,Caffeine and I'm Still Me. ,"Wanted to just say two things that have been on my mind this month. Last year on a whim, my wife and I did a week long caffeine detox. It was so much more difficult than the dry Januaries I've done. Bad headaches, wild coffee cravings, mood swings. I never realized how addicted I was. Whenever I've had a craving during DJ this year, I think about that week, and this feels like a breeze. DJ has become something I look forward to in its own way, but I don't know if I have the strength to give up coffee and tea like I did that week, I would need to check into a rehab center for caffeine. 

Another thing that continually come back to during DJ: I am still me. In some ways this is helpful, in some ways I kind of wish the problem was just alcohol and stopping drinking would resolve it. I'm still going to wake up tired and unmotivated from time to time. I can still be humorous and creative without alcohol. I'm not attempting to discount the positives of this exercise, but I am reminded every time I do this that I do not seem to personally lose who I am (for better and worse) in any significant way. And perhaps this isn't an aha moment for anyone else, but when I first started taking real efforts to have a healthier relationship with alcohol a few years back, I think that was a fear I had that I didn't or couldn't really articulate. 

Also my area needs to warm up so I can send my child outside to run. I am over being the jungle gym. ",5,1737485091.0,DryJanuary,0,1.0,False

1i6ptib,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1i6ptib/after_season_4_im_only_watching_gg_for_lorelai/,"After season 4, I'm only watching GG for Lorelai because Rory is the WORST.","This is my first time watching the show and I just need to get some things off my chest. I know there's a lot of discussions about Rory's character and how frustrating she is but up until now I just chalked a lot of it up to her being young and immature and acting out in ways normal teenagers do. 

But it's her lack of accountability that makes older Rory come off like a privileged rich spoiled ungrateful brat. (Keep in mind I'm only on season 6 ep 4) 

1) Not being a girls girl. Not ONLY her trash talking Lindsey around town and accusing her of being ""controlling"" but THEN SLEEPING WITH  DEAN? And sure, Dean was worse in this situation because he never should have married Lindsey, and he did manipulate Rory a little bit with the ""unhappy relationship"" stuff, and if Rory had listened to Lorelai and been upset or apologetic at all by her actions I think I could have forgiven her.. But no, what did she do? She got angry at her mother for telling her she was wrong and threw a temper tantrum because her mom ""ruined"" her special moment. WELL YOU RUINED A MARRIAGE RORY. And don't even get me started on the letter. 

2) So you're telling me, that after EVERYTHING everyone in Stars Hallow did for you to get you into Yale, you think you can just DROP OUT with no repercussions??? This whole arc is frustrating. Now mind you, I'm only at the beginning of season 6, so I don't know what happens, but you can't convince me that part of why she decided to drop out wasn't because of Logan. Not that I think he wanted her to drop out, but I think his dad telling her she didn't have what it took to be a journalist was him manipulating her into being a ""Better"" fit for Logan. A brainless little plucky housewife. And she fell for it, because look at her actions. 

* She drops out of Yale, and doesn't even DISCUSS it with her mother, she just ""informs"" her over coffee. Lorelai sacrificed SO MUCH and WORKED SO HARD to get her there and Rory completely disrespected her by not even hearing her out. 
* She went to Richard and Emily behind Lorelai's back KNOWING they would side with her over their own daughter. I was disgusted by that. That was the ultimate betrayal. She knew what she was doing. She manipulated them. I call this Rory ""evil Rory."" 
* Then she decides to join the DOR and basically become a miniature Emily. She get's completely enveloped into this society that YOU KNOW is full of rich racist weirdos (but she's a pretty white golden child so that doesn't matter to her) and stops using her brain for anything other than cocktail parties, gossip, and being Logan's girlfriend. I hate this version of Rory because she may have always been privileged, but now she's lost all her nuance. She's just the epitome of her privilege. Even the job she got she was only allowed to have because of her family connections. 

I dunno. Maybe I'm being to hard on Rory, and maybe it's because I'm looking at it through the currant political climate in 2025 as we're looking down the barrel of the gun at a wealthy Oligarchy, but I just can't stand her. Richard and Emily also. I used to love Emily (I just typoed her name as Evily LOL) but that whole thing with them betraying Lorelai made me hate them. 

  
Anyway who knows if I'll change my opinion these last two season but as of now I hope Rory gets a really ugly wake up call. ",0,1737485011.0,GilmoreGirls,5,0.36,False

Last date literally asked something to the effect of, ""The Left is the good ones, right?"" I tried to move past it because we seemed to click otherwise, but honestly, I developed an icky feeling over the days after. I want to find someone who is also fucking pissed about it. Enraged, not ambivalent. Politics and ethics are extremely important to me, and I want to find someone who shares those values.

Does anyone have any advice on how to find someone who actually aligns with these ideals? Or make it clear I'm available to be engaged without intruding on others? I really don't want to bother anyone who is a captive audience or doing things they would prefer to be left alone in, so obviously most common interactions are out, like stores. It seems rude to interrupt someone at places like bookstores or coffee shops, and I'd imagine most women who are going to, say, game stores for game nights are probably there to play games, not get hit on. Which, I surmise, is why my local game shop has to have a ""ladies' night"". If there weren't issues, there'd be no need for such. And I'd rather not contribute to ""issues"".

1i6pob3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Novel-Counter-4225/comments/1i6pob3/am_i_the_asshole_for_faking_a_pregnancy_test_and/,Am I the Asshole for faking a pregnancy test and leaving no trace of me because my boyfriend couldn’t treat me right,"For context I (21) female and him (32) male have been dating for over a year now, we live in the same apartment together for half of the relationship and have since then been arguing about the smallest things, he would constantly berate me about the dishes not being washes instantly and the laundry not being folded, i understand that most people would find me a red flag, but, i work twelve hours six days of the week and only have a day to rest and do the chores around the house. 

If i did the chores, it would be in a hurry, or i would be exhausted right after, the simplest chores were sometimes difficult to do because of the working conditions we both have. I have no complaints if he berated me for these kinds of things because i understood the responsibilities both of us have at home, but it would sometimes take a toll on me especially on days that i feel absolutely exhausted and just want to shower and relax and him nagging about a plate unwashed or the bed unmade. Sometimes it would be his plates unwashed and the clothes that i have to pick up after him, he is quite the conservative kind of person, because he grew up in that kind of home, while i was raised in a more independent household. 

What took me to do what i did was when, i had the toughest week of my life, my job was on the verge of letting off some of its employees and i felt like i was one of the employees being let go, aside from that, i had just lost a friend because of a fight and it took a very big toll on me to the point i was crying at work, at home, i couldn’t eat or sleep very well, and showering was the toughest thing i had to do in the mornings. 

He complained that i smelled ghastly and frankly i did, i just wanted a little compassion for the things i’ve gone through the past week, but instead got nagged and insulted for looking and “smelling like shit” this conversation wasn’t the one that ticked me off, it was the constant making me feel like i was yelling at him but i was just saying something, he would constantly ignore my opinions when he asked me about the shirt he bought or the shoes he saw or when he asks me about the food. He would ignore the opinions and advice i would make, but later he would, when a friend or family member would say the exact same thing to him, like when he asked if he should buy the shirt, i told him to buy the black one because jt would look great with his shoes, and he didn’t, but a few days later he bought the black shirt because his co worker said it would look great with his shoes, the same exact thing i said, when it came for me asking him for things such as flowers or a simple date that i didn’t have to plan, he wouldn’t listen, he would always make me feel like i was dragging him along when we went out, and when we’re with mutual friends he would make fun of me infront of them. I would cook for him the best i could because i wasn’t a great cook, and he would always have something to say about the food, and would even get to the point where the meal I prepared wouldn’t be touched and i would later find out he didn’t eat it and cooked eggs. Those were the little things that added up to this moment, i felt offended, i just wanted a little compassion and understanding from him, because i was going through something very hard. 

The times that we would get along was after we had time in the bedroom, and i would once again sweep his actions under the rug, but this time i couldn’t, i felt like the partner and friend i should have with him wasn’t there, and it hadn’t been for a long time, after our fight and me expressing to him that i just wanted his understanding and that i would pick myself back up after this, he would then proceed to tell his friend about our issues at home, as if it wasn’t enough that i had to endure the embarrassment with our mutual friends from him telling them about our fights. 

I had enough, it was bad enough he would tell them i was flat out a bad cook, but when he told them that I didn’t shower for a week because i was going through some tough times, i called it, i was pissed and felt no remorse for him, but I couldn’t leave, I didn’t have enough to support myself for an apartment or the bills it came with, and I certainly didn’t want to just break off our relationship because of these things that i felt at the time were issues we could fix if we talked and really took the time to understand each other, especially because we were in our early developmental stages of our relationship. But truthfully after some deep thinking, I really did had enough, i was tired and wanted out. 

Now, my fears about my employment have come through i was let go, and found myself without a job, he’s expressed his feelings towards the fact that I didn’t have a job, and pushed me away because of it, despite me doing better at home, and my cooking improving, he was not having it, and i was flat out looking for an apartment that i could afford while job hunting. 

While i was out talking to the real estate agent, i was clumsy enough to spill her coffee on the table and her office had a small drawer where she picked up tissue paper from, beside it was a box of tampons, and it hit me like a rock when i realised i had not had my period yet, i was late, and so i apologized for the coffee and went out her office and headed straight to the pharmacy to grab a pregnancy test, when i came home and did the test i was indeed pregnant, and it took me a few days to decide i needed a check up, but upon check ups and blood work, i found out i wasn’t. 

Truthfully it was disheartening, but also a relief, especially now that i didn’t have a job to support a child, but all of the issues i had with my boyfriend made me realize i couldn’t raise a kid with him, it would be too much for me and for him to handle, so when i went home, i spoke to him, about us nipping the bud, and i moving out, and us breaking up, i was heartbroken when he didn’t even tried to save our relationship, and felt offended that he had just let me go that easily, so when the last of my things were zipped up in my suitcase i remembered i still have the test in my vanity drawer, and it still says positive. 

I left the test inside the drawer knowing at some point he was going to look at it and realize, so i left, and a few weeks in i was working when i got a call from him, i thought nothing of it because i also forgot what i had left him, and ignored the call and went back to working at my new office about four hours away from our apartment before, he called again, and i placed my phone on silent. 

It wasn’t until i saw my friend’s text that made me read through all the texts he sent me about the pregnancy and what i was doing, he was still sending me calls and texts that I didn’t answer, frankly i want him to go crazy thinking i left with his soon to be child, i blocked him and since have not known anything about him, i told my friend to leave him be, and to let me be as well, i just want peace, and a little bit of revenge for what he put me through the past year, am i the asshole?

I happen to have the same coffee by two different roasters (I have tried it from 4 overall). I also have it as green. I tried roasting some myself the other day (light).

One of them is outstanding. Super bright and fruity with floral notes. Almost the perfect decaf. The other one is mediocre. Yes, it's better than the average decaf but the pleasant acidity and the aroma is gone. It's maybe a biiiiiiiit darker but still much lighter than your average decaf... Mine is still resting but at the moment it's somewhere in the middle. They all seem very similar in terms of roast level but, different equipment and profiles were used... I knew roasting made a difference but this is HUGE. Makes me wonder how many boring decafs could be palatable if they were roasted better...

1i6pmwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1i6pmwv/new_to_espresso_stuck_on_sour_shots_breville/,New to Espresso - Stuck on sour shots [Breville Bambino Plus],"Hi all,

I'm new to the espresso world and recently just got my beginner set up. I've followed and watched tons of videos and finally dialed in my shot to be 18g in, 36g out in 25-30 seconds, but the taste is extremely sour (To me) and would love some advice.

First, my set up:

\- Breville Bambino Plus  
\- Baratza Encore ESP  
\- Fresh coffee beans from local roster roasted on 1/16/2025 (Medium roast)  
\- Normcore V4 tamp  
\- Normcore WSD  
\- Amazon bottomless portafilter and puck screen  
\- Amazon mini food scale

Current settings: 19 on the Baratza Encore to get the 1:2 ratio in 25-30 seconds.

When I try to follow videos to do a finer grind (Even one click), barely any water comes out, and i either have to hold the button down to get to 36 grams and it takes 40-45 seconds, or end up with only 20ish g output.

I've messed with grinding from 15-21 on the baratza and all of them are sour (to me). Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!",0,1737484565.0,espresso,7,0.5,False

4-5 Agara Ramen
6 Cafe by the Ruins
7 Foam Cafe

This was during my Baguio trip last year. I decided to eat in Chaya and OMG it’s so delicious. Everything I ordered and also the fresh salad. 🤤 

Agara Ramen is a good alternative to Ramen Nagi close taste.. good umami to explain it.

Cafe by the ruins is just one of my staple whenever in Baguio so yes, I still eat here from time to time. 

Foam Cafe has a very nice interior and exterior. I saw many students hang out by this place. Their iced salted coffee is sooo good also. 🤤

I miss Baguio but I’m sad hearing the thoughts of the locals not being able to enjoy the restaus because of too much people. So I pray that eventually the congestion in the city will be better. 😬🫶🏻

Baguio is so close to my heart. Whenever I’m going through a tough time, I always visit the Baguio Cathedral to say my prayer, lit a candle. And just to unload my thoughts. Walking around Camp John Hay. And enjoying the cold breeze. ",2,1737484500.0,baguio,1,0.67,False

This morning I made a split decision to go to a coffee shop around the corner vs another one. I walked in, ordered and heard a woman say “I’m going to keep you in my thoughts, I’m thinking of you.” At first I didn’t turn to hear because I thought she was having a convo/on the phone. She then repeated herself
and I turned to her. She then said “What are you upset about? Is it because of yesterday’s events (in the US)?” I told her “I’m upset about many things, including being dumped on Friday.” For readers context, today is also my now exes birthday too but I didn’t tell her about the bday. She told me she was sorry to hear that and added many people were upset because of yesterday. She also added that things were going to get better for me. I thanked her and went on my way. I was so spooked/taken back by this interaction. 

I’m wondering if she had some spiritual abilities or if I’m reading too much into it. She was wearing a whimsical/artsy outfit if that helps provide any context.",1,1737484458.0,Mediums,2,1.0,False

I’ll be the DJ and MC for my buddies wedding. It’s my first time, so I want to know what is the best location for both sound and connectivity for the wireless microphones. I’ve attached some pictures of the venue. One is the picture of the ceremony location and the other is a drawing of the entire venue.

The rug also is much to small for the large couch sitting ontop of it. You see the couch is too long for the rug on both sides and it looks so off and not properly measured. For the amount of money she spent on these new rugs, you would think she would have properly measured her furniture for them...

Got coffee with a mentor friend of mine recently and we talked about how back in the day you needed to have well over 100 hours of multi to even get a sniff at the regionals and how getting your MEI was just expected in order to get twin time. Are we potentially looking at a similar environment? I read countless posts on this sub and other social media sites of people who have 200-300 hours of multiengine time not hearing back from anyone, and from what I hear from my buddies Part 135 hiring has also began slowing significantly and hour requirements are going back up. It's difficult to find 135 opportunities that don't require at least 100 hours of multi time.

  
I have my 1,500 hours but just 25 multi. I'm strongly considering getting my MEI when I see the competition I'm stacked against, but my school doesn't get a ton of multi students so part of me wonders if I'd just be pissing away money. On the other hand, if I'm stuck I might as well try and make the best of it and try improving my skills as an aviator. ",0,1737484328.0,flying,2,0.5,False

He asked me out but I couldn’t at the time but we still kept chatting and said that we’d love too when we’re both back because he was leaving too. Turns out by a huge coincidence he works at a radio station that I work in one day a week. I hadn’t  really heard from him during the break but I texted him when I was back and he said he was too.
I texted him again later saying I’d be working at the radio so that he wouldn’t be blindsided. He was like okay great so not much reaction by text. He then left me on read for the rest of our conversation. When I saw him for the first time it was a very close work setting and we were next to each other the entire time. We were both nervous I can tell and he seems shy but we still managed to talk. He finished later as he actually is an employee but I gained the confidence to ask him if he might want to get a coffee once he has finished and he seemed very happy too. He said he’d let me know when he was done. He never did so I went home. The next day I put a question about book recommendations in my story and he answered so I texted him asking about it. I said sorry if I made him uncomfortable and he said that he needed to apologize to me instead for not texting me but that we could do something on a weekend. I saw him at work today and everything was normal and chatty. At lunch we both went to a supermarket talked the whole way back and forth. Right as we were going back into the office I said that if he had changed his mind it was 100% okay if he wanted to forget about before but that I needed to know. He said he was very busy ( which is true) and that he goes home on some weekends ( not in the same city) but that he would be down to get a drink on a weekend. I said I didn’t want to force him and he said he wouldn’t be. Everything was like before and I’ve left home now.

Unknown Number (UN): Feeling good today?

Me: Might I ask who is speaking?

UN: Excuse me, are you Mary? I’m Daisy.

Me: No, I’m sorry, you have the wrong number. Have a good one!

UN: Sorry, I entered the wrong number. I hope you don’t mind.

Me: No problem.

UN: Thank you for your understanding. If you are not far from California, I can buy you a cup of coffee to apologize.

Me: I am very far from California, so no.

Daisy: Anyway, nice to meet you! I’m Daisy from California, and you?

Me: Aaand there it is. Sorry, “Daisy,” but this is where your scheme ends.

I then blocked the number and deleted the conversation. This has all the trappings of a “wrong number” scam, in which the scammer randomly cold texts the victim, pretending to have simply texted the wrong number. Once they get a response, they get to work trying to keep the conversation going.

The first red flag, which I actually missed because it’s fairly easy to, was the way the texter opened the conversation. Most people open new text conversations **by identifying themselves.** e.g. “Hi Ben, it’s Reed from work!” Beware text conversations that do not open with identification.

The next red flag was the way the texter apologized. Someone who actually texted the wrong number would apologize and then **end the conversation.** e.g. “Oh, sorry. Have a nice day.” Not so here; the texter intentionally leaves the conversation open-ended.

Next, the texter dangles the promise of a free coffee and an in-person meeting. Someone who genuinely texted the wrong number wouldn’t do this, as **a wrong number text obviously isn’t enough of an inconvenience to warrant reparations with free food.** the scammer is trying to lure in lonely people with the idea of a date.

Lastly, after that rejection, the texter tries to establish a friendly rapport with the victim. Obviously, a genuine wrong number text wouldn’t get this far. If the texter does this, they’re trying to **gain your trust so they can fleece you later, under the pretense that you’re “friends”.** Do not believe them.

These scammers prey on your good will. Watch for these red flags to keep yourself safe from scams like this.",11,1737484067.0,Scams,21,0.76,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I need someone who is grounded but excited about life, someone who is not afraid of taking risks, maybe a bit strange, because I usually steer ''regular'' guys away with my own weirdness. And there is plenty of it. For example, if there are a bunch of foxes screaming outside my house in the middle of the night and they wake me up, i run out and scream at them until they go away. I would like someone who could do that for me or with me :D I would like to travel a lot more, but I don't feel safe doing it on my own, would want a guy to be by my side, especially if we hitchike or travel in cheaper, but less safe ways maybe.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Hi DOTers! I'm a long time reader and poster on this sub, it's helped me through some truly disastrous dating situations. Earlier this year, I posted a thread about ""the oversharing phenomenon"" and had a lot of interesting discussion. There was one comment from a guy who lived near me that caught my eye, and by some magical serendipity that neither of us quite understand, he decided to message me later that evening. After some friendly back and forth, he invited me out on a coffee date. I had deleted my apps (for good!) a few months prior, so I figured there was no harm in meeting this random guy from reddit.

There was definitely a mutual attraction when we met, but I was still feeling pretty cautious about dating, having been burned pretty badly by a guy over Christmas. So we started going on dates (that he thoughtfully planned <3) and getting to know each other slowly. After about a month we went on a camping trip together and I think that's where we both really fell for each other. He was transparent about his interest in me the whole time and I had to work on believing that a guy like him actually existed (going on over 200 dates will really do something to your psyche, I tell you).

Since then we've traveled internationally together, gone to burning man, and are co-parenting a dog I recently adopted. We joke about whether we're still in the honeymoon phase or not because we've had our share of bickering, but we're so happy. It's by FAR the healthiest relationship I've ever been in! I'd gotten to the point of being pretty pessimistic about dating after being single 6 years, so I'm incredibly grateful that there actually was a man out there for me who was everything I wanted and more.

Oh and I'm 33F and he's 29, so he would have not even made it in my dating app age filters. Just goes to show, you \*never\* know how you'll meet someone. When I was single I really loved hearing stories like these, so just wanted to share some hope and happiness with y'all :)

TL;DR: met an amazing guy on this sub and now we are in LOVE!

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.

I manage to be a decently functioning adult.  I am divorced, but I am a good dad and have been dating a woman my kids like for 3+ years (I like her too!).  My house is typically  messy, but I do own a modest house. I struggle sometimes at work, but make above average the median wage and have had the same job for 7 years. I don't have a emergency fund, but I have good credit and contribute to a retirment fund pretty regularly. You get the idea. Things are clearly ok, but things could clearly be better in lots of ways.

But there is also this: I am almost always exhausted. Like bone tired level of exhaustion comes up most days. I first remember this coming up in college. Sometimes I'm also dizzy from exhaustion. Hydration and exercise help some, but not completely.

Here is what I realized.

My processing speed and working memory suck--not official terms, but the same testing during my diagnosis that showed high IQ also showed low processing speed and working memory. But high IQ can solve a lot of problems. So it seems like I've routed my daily tasks through my intellect rather than through the habit building that working memory and processing speed seem to allow. Like when I put laundry away, I have to actually think about how to put laundry away.  When I clean the house, I have to actively think about how to do it.  There are very few daily processes that genuinely just become habit--I have to really think about all of them to make them happen.

I was talking to my GF about this and she noted that it sounds exhausting. I literally broke down crying in a coffee shop out of the recognition. It is so exhausting.

(unpopular opinion?),"There are two things about fan culture that I find weird… Both could apply to fans of any celebrity I suppose,  but in this case I’m focusing on idols…. Anyways, these things are:

1. Waiting for idols at airports

2. Taking pictures/videos of idols when they’re off duty (for example, attending another artists’ concert or dining at a restaurant with friends) 


Firstly, waiting for idols at the airport is weird behaviour. Perhaps it started with innocent enough intentions: welcoming them to your country/city or welcoming them home. However, even then I found it kind of odd? But nowadays, it seems that people are mainly concerned with getting content to post online, whether it be a photo of the idol walking by, a video of them accepting a gift, or something else. I guess I don’t have too much more to say about this as I’m bad with words and can’t think of how else to elaborate…  

Moving on, I think it’s kind of creepy how people will take photos and videos of idols when they’re simply existing in public. For example, the amount of posts I see with photos and videos of idols at a concert…. It’s so weird to me… First of all, who cares if X idol is .. idk.. drinking coffee at a park? Second, why do you feel the need to get photos and videos of them doing whatever it is they’re doing? I guess I should mention that this doesn’t apply IF you have received permission from the idol to get a photo/video of them OR they’re doing something malicious. But when they’re simply existing in a public space, not causing any harm, I don’t think it’s okay. Of course, I don’t expect that people will ever change their behavior OR that it will be discouraged by companies, authorities, etc. Nor do I think it’s necessarily a priority since it’s not necessarily dangerous or anything like that… But I do think it’s weird and invasive….  Why can’t you just let them be? Why do you have to get pics/videos of them to most likely lost online? Is a hit tweet really that important? I just don’t get it… Again, this doesn’t apply to people who get permission from idols to get a photo/video of them OR in cases where someone is documenting an idols’ harmful actions and such…. 

Anyways… I guess I’ll end things here because I’m having trouble with wording again… I’m aware that this is probably a pretty unpopular opinion and that this is fairly normalised behavior so I don’t expect everyone to agree… But I’m curious what others think?

I have zero appetite during the day, I’ve always felt a bit nauseous first thing in the morning so I can’t eat breakfast for the first couple of hours after I wake, the majority of the time I have to take my meds before work, they kick in and I get so focused in my work and with them being appetite suppressors I generally live off a couple of coffees and water until I get home, I occasionally have lunch.

I get home from work with the meds wearing off and one of two things happen….

Either I look in my fridge or freezer and don’t feel like eating any of the food in there that I had actually looking forward to cooking and eating when shopping only a few days before, and then sit there with decision paralysis resulting in me either not eating anything or getting that hungry I get Deliveroo round, normally past any normal dinner time at this point.

Or
 
I eat all the food 🐷

I’ve tried batch cooking and freezing, doing smaller food shops but multiple times per week, which is then more tasks so my brain just goes, nah mate not happening🤷🏻‍♂️
