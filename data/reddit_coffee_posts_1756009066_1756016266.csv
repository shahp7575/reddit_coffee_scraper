1myo2qs,https://i.redd.it/abg8qv7ntwkf1.jpeg,This device has been a total game changer for me.,"First off, I really don’t like ereaders. No offense to anyone, but I have tried 5 or 6 different ones at this point and I never end up using them. I vastly prefer actual physical books, and I almost get depressed with ereaders. 

But with this Palma, I can stick it in my pocket and do “Micro-Reading” sessions when I’m waiting for a coffee or waiting in my doctors office. The books I have been reading are 1200+ pages and so bringing them with me is not an option unless I have a backpack. And my kindle/kobos were too big to stick in a pocket and I hate just having to carry it. 

I thought I would hate this Palma just as much as the others, but it’s been the opposite. I can add in 1-2 pages at a time and I have been able to basically cut my reading times for books in half. 

I HIGHLY recommend this device to people who prefer paper books, because this just genuinely fills a gap you probably don’t even realize you have. ",1,1756016177.0,Onyx_Boox,0,1.0,False

1myo1zz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baptist/comments/1myo1zz/ever_feel_like_lifes_unfair_psalm_73_had_that/,Ever feel like life’s unfair? Psalm 73 had that thought before you did,"So here’s the deal: sometimes I look around and think, “Why does everyone else seem to have it easier? They’re thriving, vibing, moving on with life, while I’m over here fighting anxiety with three cups of coffee and prayer.”

Apparently, I’m not the first one to feel that. David (yes, slingshot David) literally wrote this in Psalm 73:

> “I was envious of the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked… my feet almost slipped.”

Translation: “God, why are the jerks winning?”

But then he has this perspective shift. He says it didn’t make sense…

> “Until I entered the sanctuary of God; then I perceived their end.”

Basically: “Oh right, this world isn’t the whole story.”

And he lands with maybe the rawest mic-drop line in the Bible:

> “Whom do I have in heaven but You? And with You, I desire nothing on earth.
My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.” (vv. 25–26)

The wicked may win for a moment. But in the long run, God is the only inheritance worth having.

Paul says in Philippians 3:14, ***‘I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.’***

 In other words: don’t tap out, don’t get distracted. Keep running. The prize is bigger than what you see today.",1,1756016107.0,Baptist,0,1.0,False

I'm a 35F, married with toddler twins. I'm looking for others to write to. Initially we can chat on Reddit, and then move to email if we click. I do miss the days of snail mail so we may get to that stage, but we warned I have terrible handwriting and also I live in the Southern Hemisphere so postage costs might be tricky 😂.  I am not looking to rush things and you don't need to respond immediately. I certainly won't!

I have a preference for women penpals because I find that men tend to want NSFW or inappropriate. I am not here for that. There are plenty of other subreddits for this. So if you are a guy and want to write, please be pure in your intentions.

I don't really mind age, so much as life stage. You don't need to be a parent, just understand that me being a parent does influence my views on life. I am pretty settled into a relatively quiet life filled with family commitments and work. I do love writing though and I am a (bad) poet. Words have always been a passion of mine. The idea is that our correspondence would be longer but also at a slower pace.  

I enjoy talking about your life, learning about your day-to-day and having a laugh. People sometimes comment on my dark sense of humour. My interests are mostly going to the gym, drinking coffee, reading, podcasts, thrifting and crochet.

You explore Niphu Monastery and ancient caves which are about 2500 years old. Jhong Cave is the largest man-made the cave in Upper Mustang. It is fascinating as it is five stories high and has more than 40 rooms. These caves hold the secrets from the past centuries as they are decorated with Buddhist murals and Tibetan scripts on ancient parchments held by worn wooden covers. You return back to Lo-Manthang in the afternoon and explore the palaces and fortress of the capital of the former Kingdom of Lo. Overnight at a lodge in Lo-Manthang.

**Day 9: Trek from Lo-Manthang to Yara 3650m/6-7 hours**

**Day 15: Reserve Day for flight delay/cancellation and afternoon flight back to Kathmandu**

..........

(Knocking on the door, the door opens)

Hello, are you awake? 

Just checking if you're alive. It's almost midday and you still haven't left the room.

Is everything ok? Can I come in?

(Speaker walks in)

What happened?

Oh, it's just one of those days? Do you want me to leave or do you not mind some company?

Splendid! Move over.

(Speaker lies in bed beside the listener)

So, what was it this time? Or is it just in general?

Oh, I'm so sorry...

How am I doing what?

(Amused) Hahaha, I don't. I'm barely keeping it together. Maybe I'm just a little better at pretending.

(More serious) You know I've been through some serious shit lately. But the truth is that there always was ""something"". And I've started to think that it will always be that way. It just won't get better. Maybe that's how life is supposed to look. Dukkha. Life is suffering. But! In case I were wrong I've decided to stick around and wait a little more. Maybe life is really worth living.

Yeah, I've tried a lot of things. Some worked, some didn't. Like: go out and meet people. I'm not really a social person, so that made me feel even worse. Or: drink more water. (Slightly irritated) I am drinking a lot of water! But anyway, how does it suppose to help you when something in your life had just fucked up really bad? Next time somebody will say to me (mockingly) ""oh, you look so sad, maybe you should try to drink more water"" I will punch them straight in the face, I'm not joking.

(Calmly and caring) Oh no, you should totally drink water, just don't think it will magically cure every disease. But when you feel tired, numb, your head hurts, there is a big chance you are dehydrated. Drinking water definitely makes you feel better physically. But, personally, it never helped me mentally, in any way. You can drink as much water as you are able to, but that won't bring back your will to live. Speaking of: did you drink water today?

Do you even have something to drink here?

Good. Now be a good roomie and drink it for me.

No, no, no excuses. Just drink it 

Good job! Now I feel a bit like a water nazi or something, I didn't expect that... If you like me enough, you won't make me say this again and just drink the water by your own will, ok? I would really appreciate that.

Something that really worked? Starting simple: a shower.

(Slightly upset) No, I don't mean you stink! You don't. Shower is just one of the simplest ways to make you feel a bit better. Not a long warm bath, but just a shower. And I don't mean to stand there for an hour with water pouring on your head. You walk in, wash yourself, walk out and dry yourself with a fresh and clean towel. Now the most important part - you put on fresh and clean clothes. Even if it would be a pyjamas. It's a small thing but you really feel better afterwards. 

Something else? Ummm... The best universal advice I got: small steps. If you feel like you can't do a thing, start with small things. Small tasks. Like, for example, take out a few dirty dishes from your room. Put that pile of clothes back in the closet. Change the sheets. Nothing spectacular, nothing overwhelming. Just small things that need to be done. You don't have to be perfect, it doesn't even have to make any difference, but as soon as you finish there is something happening with your brain. Like gears are unlocked or some chemicals, and after a few small rounds it starts to feel easier. You begin to feel motivated and before you know, you are back at your feet.

Of course it doesn't have to refer to cleaning. It's just my personal kink. Doesn't have to work with you. I'm just one of those people who need to take care of their personal space before everything else. I think it is my coping mechanism. When the surroundings are clear, my thoughts are also clearer. And when things go back to their places I feel like: yeah, now I can deal with other problems too.

You know I'm not a cleaning freak. I really don't mind a healthy amount of dirt and mess. But when I'm feeling down it works as another trigger to feel worse. So - yes, cleaning is my defence reaction.

No, it doesn't work like that. I wish it would. It would be so simple: every time you feel depressed you start cleaning and suddenly you are full of the joys of spring. Too beautiful to be true. Usually I just lay in bed, not able to move a finger and in my head I'm scrolling the list of activities to check if maybe I find something that doesn't make me want to vomit just by thinking of it. If I don't find anything I just pick whatever hurts the least, like picking up the clothes from the floor, watering the plants... Something simple. And sometimes I just end up doing a few meaningless things through all day, which is also ok, but sometimes the ice is breaking and I'm back from the dead. I think it's worth trying. Just don't try to rearrange your whole wardrobe at once, believe me. Start with one shelf or one drawer. You will do as much as you are really able to and won't get frustrated

Something for bad thoughts? Yes, I have two tricks. First is kind of obvious: ASMR. Or roleplay audios, to be more clear.

Technically it's the same as watching movies, reading books or listening to audiobooks, but somehow it works differently. It is more intense. When there's a lot going on in my head then I'm really not able to focus on anything that comes from outside. I just stop following the actions and get lost in my own thoughts. But ASMR hits differently. When it's well done you are really in it. You are in a different world, you are a different person. You don't just watch, you're in the centre of the action. It really helps to disassociate when you need it.

Yeah, it may look like I'm just overenthusiastic but I've been in it for a few years now and there were at least a few times ASMR helped me to stay sane and I'm dead serious right now.

Like when you know something really bad is going to happen, something that will change your life forever. And you can't do nothing, because sometimes there is just nothing that can be done. You are just lying in your bed and waiting for the inevitable. It's night, you are alone. Your body works against you, heart is pounding, stomach is aching. You're feeling sick, exhausted, powerless and frustrated. You know you won't sleep that night and you feel you just can't handle this. And those are the moments that ASMR helped me go through.

Personally I prefer those with stories. Fantasy or science fiction. When there is a plot you need to focus on. Or mystery that needs to be solved. I know few authors that are just genius, both with acting and writing. Their work is better than most things you see on TV. I will send you some links later. Pick your poison: vampires, werewolves, demons, elves, monsters...

Order accepted.

The second trick? Ooh, you won't like that one. When I feel my brain is about to turn into a mashed potato I... learn new things. Like something easy enough to not get frustrated but difficult enough to keep you focused. And something you can learn by yourself, from the app or tutorials. New language, playing on an instrument, drawing... It doesn't really matter if you succeed or how long you will continue. What's important is the process itself. That few minutes when every brain cell sticks to that one challenge. It feels like a reset for the mind, I've tried it on myself many times. Sounds stupid, but works.

(With disbelief) Masochistic? (Amused) Hahaha, at least I made you laugh. 

(Speaker is getting up)

Anyway, it's my time for coffee. Should I bring you more water or would you rather join me in the kitchen? You can bring those dirty dishes along.

(Soft and caring) Come on, get up. Small steps.

The first few months are a blur of feedings, diaper changes, and sleepless nights. While you can't get a personal assistant for your baby, technology has stepped in to offer a helping hand. From tracking every last detail to providing expert advice, there's an app for almost every aspect of newborn care.
Here are 10 of the best apps for new parents, designed to simplify your life and help you navigate the early stages of parenthood with confidence.
1. Baby Tracker - Newborn Log
This app is a lifesaver for the data-driven parent. Baby Tracker is an all-in-one hub for monitoring your baby's daily life. It allows you to log everything from feeding times (breastfeeding, bottle, or solids) and diaper changes to sleep schedules. The app also has a health section for tracking doctor visits, medications, and vaccinations. The ability to sync with multiple devices means both parents and caregivers can stay on the same page, which is invaluable for nighttime feedings and shared care.
2. Huckleberry: Baby & Child
Huckleberry goes beyond simple tracking by offering personalized sleep guidance. The app's standout feature is the ""SweetSpot"" prediction, which analyzes your baby's unique sleep patterns to suggest the ideal time for their next nap. This feature can be a game-changer for exhausted parents trying to establish a sleep routine. While the basic tracking features are free, the advanced sleep plans and one-on-one expert consultations are available with a paid subscription.
3. The Wonder Weeks
Based on the best-selling book of the same name, The Wonder Weeks app helps parents understand and navigate their baby's developmental ""leaps."" It provides a week-by-week calendar of your baby's mental development and explains the fussiness, crying, and changes in behavior that often accompany these periods. The app offers a heads-up on what to expect and provides tips on how to support your baby through each leap.
4. Glow Baby
Part of the popular Glow family of apps, Glow Baby is a comprehensive tracker that simplifies the first year of your baby's life. It tracks developmental milestones, feedings, diapers, and sleep, and even includes a growth chart to compare your baby's progress with World Health Organization data. The app also features daily tips and articles, as well as a community forum where you can connect with other new parents for advice and support.
5. BabySparks
If you're looking for an app that focuses on your baby's development, BabySparks is an excellent choice. This app provides over 1,300 expert-designed activities to help your baby reach important developmental milestones. The activities are organized by age and category (e.g., cognitive, motor, language), and are easy to integrate into your daily routine. It's like having a developmental expert in your pocket, with daily activity suggestions to encourage your baby's growth.
6. BabyCenter
BabyCenter is a trusted name in parenting resources, and its app delivers a wealth of information. You can use it to track your baby's growth and developmental milestones. The app provides a daily digest of information relevant to your baby's age, with medically reviewed articles and videos on everything from breastfeeding to baby safety. It also has a vibrant community where you can connect with other parents and find support.
7. Sound Sleeper
For those nights when nothing seems to soothe your crying baby, Sound Sleeper can be a lifesaver. This app offers a variety of white noise, nature sounds, and lullabies designed to calm and help your baby sleep. A unique feature is the ""Listen"" mode, which can automatically start playing a sound when it detects your baby crying, allowing you to stay in bed and get some much-needed rest.
8. Peanut
Parenthood can be lonely, and Peanut aims to solve that. Often described as a ""Tinder for moms,"" this social networking app connects you with other mothers in your area who are at a similar life stage. Whether you're looking for a playdate, a coffee buddy, or just someone who understands the challenges of new parenthood, Peanut provides a supportive community right at your fingertips.
9. CDC's Milestone Tracker
For parents who want to be sure their baby is on track with their developmental milestones, the CDC's official Milestone Tracker app is a great tool. It provides interactive checklists of key milestones from 2 months to 5 years, along with photos and videos to illustrate what each milestone looks like. It also offers tips to support your child's development and provides information on when to talk to a doctor about any concerns.
10. Tinybeans
New parents take a ton of photos, but sharing them can be a hassle. Tinybeans is a secure and private photo-sharing platform specifically for families. You can create a digital journal of your baby's first years, complete with photos, videos, and journal entries. The best part is that you can safely share these memories with family and friends without the privacy concerns of public social media. It's a beautiful way to document your baby's growth and keep loved ones in the loop.

[Bro, after the birth, we'll swap Jessica and Anna back like planned. Fair's fair.]
Jessica's husband had cheated.
His phone revealed the ""drunken mistake"" was a lie.
""Anna's pregnant.""
William stated it flatly, like announcing weather.
Jessica's teacup froze mid-air.
Steam blurred the man's face across from her.
""Mine.""
""Jess, you know I need an heir. The pressure from my parents...""
The day Anna's pregnancy was confirmed, Jessica slept separately for the first time in nine years together, six married.
Ninety-nine IVF attempts. Zero children.
Anna. One night.
Aaron and Michelle threatened suicide to keep the baby. Even William pleaded: ""Give my parents descendants.""
Jessica agreed through searing pain.
Everything shifted that day.
She surrendered her bedroom, her husband, finally her life.
When fire engulfed the villa, only Jessica and Anna remained.
William rushed in, scooped Anna into his arms.
""William! My legs!""
Jessica begged as flames licked her pinned legs.
He paused, holding Anna, avoiding her gaze.
""Anna's pregnant. Get yourself out.""
Turning to Anna: ""You're both safe.""
He ignored the burning debris crushing Jessica's legs.
As consciousness faded, she remembered William standing in downpour five years prior: ""I'll abandon everything for you."" He'd endured 999 rounds of traditional family punishment, nearly severing ties with his parents.
Now choosing Anna and the heir over her life.
The love was gone.
Near death, Jessica thought: If saved, she'd gracefully let go.
Tick-tock.
Dripping water woke her.
""Jessica, you're finally awake.""
Jessica turned to find William's bloodshot eyes fixed on her, his face gaunt with exhaustion.
Jessica recalled how he'd stayed by her bedside night after night during past illnesses, and a flicker of warmth stirred within her. ""I'm not...""
""Jessica..."" He cut her off, pausing as if steeling himself.
""We'll divorce first to satisfy the Moores. Once Anna delivers the baby, we'll remarry."" The words tumbled out like rehearsed lines. ""After divorce, you'll keep living here. The child will be registered under your name—you'll raise him.""
Jessica stared incredulously at the man she'd loved for five years.
Was this some cruel joke?
Expecting her to raise his mistress's child?
What did he take her for?
William avoided her gaze, murmuring, ""You're the mother I want for my child. As long as he bears your name, you'll always be an Anderson daughter-in-law.""
""Why?""
Her voice scraped out, raspy as coarse sandpaper.
""Anna needs legitimacy. The family has decided.""
""We divorce. I marry Anna.""
Jessica watched the man who'd held her heart for eight years.
""And your brother?"" she asked, trembling uncontrollably.
""He agreed. I know this is unfair to you.""
William's brow furrowed, genuine guilt finally surfacing.
""Jessica, I'll make it up to you.""
Compensation?
For eight years of youth? For shattered love? For their broken home?
A hysterical laugh bubbled in Jessica's throat.
It escaped—a twisted grimace more painful than tears.
""Okay.""
Just one word.
William froze, unprepared for her surrender.
His rehearsed pleas clogged in his throat.
After a stunned moment, he produced documents. ""Sign the divorce papers.""
Jessica lowered her eyes. His signature already stained the page.
Ice spread through her veins.
She held the pen suspended. Minutes crawled by until William's pleading gaze shifted to unease, then thinly veiled impatience.
""Jessica, sign it.""
Jessica moved at last.
Her stiff lips curved slowly upward.
A faint, lifeless smile.
""Alright.""
Her voice floated, unnervingly calm.
As she signed, William's audible relief filled the room.
He even offered a conciliatory smile.
""Don't overthink this, Jessica. Focus on healing. My kindness to Anna? Just placating my parents—making them believe I value this child. Once born, I'll bring him to you. We'll...""
A phone rang—Anna's call. With an apologetic glance, William turned away without hesitation.
""Sweetie, just wait for me to carry you if your ankle's twisted."" His voice trailed off as he strode toward the door.
When Jessica returned home after a month hospitalized, every trace of her existence had vanished.
The living room vase no longer held her hyacinths—roses, Anna's favorite, bloomed instead.
The clothes from the master bedroom closet had been moved to the guest room closet.
As if possessed, she picked up William's spare phone left on the coffee table.
The screen lit up, revealing an unread message.
The sender was William's brother, Victor.
[Bro, once the baby's born, we'll swap Jessica and Anna back like we agreed. So no one loses out.]
The last thread of sanity snapped in Jessica's mind.
She clutched the phone, knuckles whitened from the grip, blood seeming to freeze in her veins.
She recalled William's unusual reactions in bed recently,
remembered how Victor kept staring at her, even joking about the hickeys William left.
Not a drunken mistake, not a reckless night—but a long-planned swap.
A chill crawled down Jessica's spine, nausea churning in her stomach.
Stumbling, she fled the mansion.

Chapter 2

After leaving the manor house, Jessica had nowhere to go.
This city had once become her home because of a man named William.
Now it was no longer home.
Without ID, Jessica found a cheap motel and huddled in the cold quilt, sleepless all night.
The next day, Michelle called, her tone brooking no argument.
""Jessica, return to the manor. The media is watching. You must play your part.""
The call ended abruptly.
No inquiries about her recovery—only commands.
Since William had nearly severed ties with his parents for her, Jessica had always obeyed Michelle.
Penniless, with William holding her ID... Jessica decided to go back.
Their wedding photo still sat in the living room, both beaming in the frame.
Jessica walked past expressionlessly and turned the frame face down.
She began packing.
The scented candle he'd personally chosen for her—tossed in the trash.
The limited-edition vinyl record he'd gifted—snapped in half.
Every expensive suit, tie, and cufflink from his walk-in closet—methodically packed into cold cardboard boxes.
Each motion severed the past.
The door opened.
William entered, frowning at the boxes littering the floor.
""What are you doing?""
""Making space for you.""
Jessica didn't look up, her voice flat.
William seemed relieved, thinking she was throwing a tantrum.
He stepped closer, tone artificially gentle.
""Jessie, don't be like this.
Starting today, Anna will move in with me for easier care.""
Jessica froze.
She slowly raised her head, meeting his gaze.
No guilt on his face—just matter-of-fact announcement.
So he wasn't moving out.
He was bringing another woman into their home.
The last warmth drained from Jessica's heart.
She nodded softly. ""Okay.""
Just then, a frail voice sounded at the door.
""William? May I come in?""
Anna stood at the threshold in a white maternity dress, slight baby bump visible, wearing a smug smile.
Her eyes swept over Jessica like appraising discarded junk.
""Sister, you're here too~ I just wanted to see what's missing in my future home.""
Her words stabbed Jessica's heart like a poison-tipped needle.
Anna entered the living room, eyes landing on Jessica's favorite wall painting.
""This painting's too gloomy for the baby.
William, let's replace it?""
William didn't glance at the artwork, just cooed at Anna: ""Okay, whatever you say.""
Anna smiled. She approached Jessica, voice dropping to a whisper only they could hear:
""Jessica, you lost.""
Suddenly she gasped dramatically, collapsing sideways toward the coffee table.
""Ah!""
""Anna!""
William's face paled. He lunged forward, catching her in a steady embrace before she hit the corner.
He turned around, his eyes bloodshot, glaring at Jessica.
""Jessica!
What did you do to her!""
That roar sliced through Jessica's heart like a blade.
She stood frozen, unable to react.
She had done nothing.
""I didn't..."" Jessica's voice cracked, dry and hoarse.
""How dare you deny it!""
William's gaze turned icy: ""She's carrying the Anderson heir!
If anything happens to her, I'll bury you with her!""
Cradling Anna, he checked her with utmost care, as if holding priceless treasure.
While Jessica—was nothing but discarded trash to him.
Leaning against William's chest, Anna allowed a faint, unnoticed smile to touch her lips.
William scooped her up and strode away without a backward glance.
As he passed Jessica, his shoulder slammed hard into hers.
Staggering backward, Jessica's arm struck the doorframe with a sickening thud.
Sharp pain shot through her.
But William's steps never faltered.
He carried his treasure away, never looking back.
The empty living room held only Jessica now.
Slowly, she slid down the wall to the floor.
A dark bruise bloomed on her arm, throbbing with heat—yet she couldn't feel it.

Chapter 3

Jessica didn't know how long she'd sat on the floor until her legs went numb. She finally pushed herself up using the wall and limped back to the bedroom that once belonged to them both.
Now, only she remained.
The next morning, Jessica froze at the top of the stairs, her eyes stung by the scene in the dining room.
William was tenderly helping Anna into her seat—a gentleness he'd rarely shown her.
His gaze flickered almost imperceptibly when it landed on the bruise marring Jessica's arm.
A fleeting shadow of guilt.
Yet that guilt evaporated instantly beneath Anna's fragile whimper.
""William,"" Anna leaned against his shoulder, her voice honeyed though her eyes taunted Jessica, ""I've no appetite today. Just some Herbed Root Porridge, please.""
William stiffened.
Herbed Root Porridge.
The first thing Jessica ever cooked for him.
In that cramped rented apartment, he'd burned with fever while she kept vigil all night. At dawn, she'd presented him a steaming hot bowl.
William's throat moved. He looked at Jessica, hesitation threading his voice before it hardened into command.
""Jessica. Make a bowl.""
She watched him, noting the struggle in his eyes before they surrendered to resolve.
Suddenly, it all felt absurd.
""Alright.""
The single word fell flat, lifeless as stagnant water.
Jessica turned to the kitchen. She found the roots, peeled them, diced them, dropped them into the clay pot.
Each motion precise yet mechanical, like programmed movements.
Bubbles gurgled in the pot, releasing earthy fragrance.
Once, William had hugged her from behind, laughing as he praised her skill.
Now, the scent choked her.
She ladled a portion into a bowl, carried it out, and set it silently before Anna.
The porcelain spoon clinked against the rim.
""Careful, it's hot.""
William lifted the spoon, blew on it repeatedly, then brought it to Anna's lips.
Anna accepted his feeding, eyes blissfully closed.
Jessica stood aside, an unwanted prop in their scene.
Staying longer would make her vomit.
She climbed the stairs, shutting out the loving couple behind her.
Night deepened.
Jessica had just lain down when the bedroom door slammed open.
Two black-suited bodyguards marched in, grabbed her arms without expression.
""What are you doing!""
Jessica struggled as old wounds screamed under their grip.
They dragged her downstairs.
The living room blazed with light yet felt glacial.
William stood center stage, face stormy, clutching a lab report.
Anna lay pale on the sofa, a flustered family doctor hovering nearby.
""Speak!
What did you put in that porridge!""
William's voice scraped through clenched teeth, laced with lethal frost.
The bodyguards shoved Jessica forward. She stumbled, knees hitting the floor.
""I didn't.""
She lifted her chin, meeting his frozen glare. ""Nothing.""
""Still lying!""
William slapped the lab report across her face.
The edge of the paper scraped her cheek, leaving a faint sting.
""The doctor detected excessive alkaloids in the porridge!
Anna had severe abdominal pain and nearly miscarried!
And you still say you did nothing?""
Jessica looked at his furious face, and the numb spot in her heart was brutally torn open again.
Just then, Aaron and Michelle Anderson rushed over.
As soon as Michelle saw the weak Anna on the sofa and Jessica kneeling on the floor, rage instantly surged to her head.
She charged forward, raised her hand, and with all her strength, slapped Jessica hard across the face.
""Slap—!""
The crisp sound echoed through the entire living room.
Jessica's face was knocked to one side, her ears ringing.
""You poisonous woman!
What sin did our Anderson family commit to marry a woman like you who can't bear children and has a wicked heart!""
""Lock this woman up!
Once Anna and the child are safe, we'll settle the score with her!""
Michelle ordered sharply.
The bodyguards immediately stepped forward and hauled Jessica up again.

Chapter 4

Jessica was roughly thrown into the basement storage by two bodyguards, her forehead hitting the concrete wall, blood oozing out.
The iron door slammed shut behind her with a clang.
Jessica knelt on the cold floor, a biting chill piercing her knees.
Her cheek stung with a burning pain.
She remembered long ago, when they crowded in a small rented room.
That year she lost her parents, and the winter was bitterly cold.
William wrapped her in his arms, warming her icy hands and feet with his body heat.
He once said, ""Jessica, I promise to give you a home, a forever warm home.""
Jessica slowly hugged herself.
After an unknown time, the iron door opened again.
The blinding light made her instinctively squint.
William stood at the door, his figure outlined in a hazy silhouette by the light.
He walked in, looking down at her.
""Get up.""
His voice sounded weary.
Jessica didn't move.
William swallowed, then crouched down.
His tone softened a bit.
""The test results... the hospital made a mistake, the Herbed Root Porridge was fine.""
William tried to explain.
His gaze swept over Jessica's forehead with bloodstains and swollen face, and William felt a pang in his eyes.
Jessica smiled faintly.
William would rather she cried or made a scene than stay in this suffocating atmosphere.
He turned and walked toward the door, ""Get out.
Rest well, we're hosting guests in a few days.""
Jessica leaned on the wall and walked out of the basement step by step.
The things William sent were piled up in the living room.
The latest limited-edition handbags, high-end custom jewelry.
Even the keys to a new car.
Jessica passed by, her eyes sweeping over those shiny things.
Three days later, the Anderson family hosted a charity gala.
To give Anna and her unborn child prestige and recognition.
Michelle specifically called to warn Jessica, that she must play the role of the generous and virtuous eldest daughter-in-law well.
In the banquet hall, Anna wore a custom-made red gown.
Holding William's arm, her face flushed with happiness, her belly slightly swollen, which she deliberately pushed out.
Jessica stood alone in a corner, wearing a plain white dress.
Whispers surrounded her.
""Look, that's her, the one who can't have children.""
""I heard she tried to poison Miss Anna a few days ago, how vicious.""
""Poor William, stuck with such a wife.""
Jessica's face was expressionless.
The highlight of the gala was the charity auction.
The final lot was a sapphire necklace named ""Tears of the Stars"".
Jessica's breath caught for a moment.
William had promised her that he would win it for her on their third wedding anniversary.
The host introduced the necklace's origin.
Anna suddenly tugged William's sleeve, pointed at the necklace, and said in a coquettish voice, ""William, it's so beautiful.""
William's gaze swept through the crowd.
Finally, it didn't linger on Jessica.
He picked up the paddle and placed a sky-high bid.
The exorbitantly priced necklace fell into William's hands.
When William personally put the necklace on Anna, the whole room erupted in applause.
Everyone was immersed in their happiness, only Jessica felt nauseated.
She turned and fled the noisy place.
On the balcony, the cold wind blew, bringing a moment of clarity to her confused mind.
Behind her, Anna's voice drifted over faintly.
Jessica froze.
She slowly turned to face Anna.
Anna beamed brightly. ""If you hadn't met William first, you'd never have become Mrs. Anderson.""
Jessica stared coldly. ""Want it? I'll give you everything.""
""The title of Mrs. Anderson. This necklace. That man...""
Anna's smile stiffened.
Jessica turned away.
A deep, magnetic voice cut through the balcony shadows.
""Finished watching the Anderson family drama?""
Jessica halted.
A tall figure emerged—Jose.
Impeccable black suit. Red wine swirling in his glass.
Eyes dark and penetrating.
He stopped before Jessica, gaze fixed on her.
Yet his words targeted Anna. ""Miss Anna, didn't Mr. Anderson ask you to rest upstairs?""
Anna paled, nodding stiffly before hurrying away.
Better avoid the Roberts heir—everyone knew he was borderline psychopathic.
""Seems you still don't see it."" Jose's voice dropped lower. ""You'll let them trample over you while they play happy family?""
Jessica's heart clenched.
Jose leaned closer, words dripping with temptation.
""What if I help you?""
""Help you make them pay back everything they owe you. Double.""

Chapter 5

She slowly turned around and met those deep, unfathomable eyes.
""Who are you?""
Jose chuckled softly and drained the glass of red wine in one gulp.
He casually placed the glass on the railing, making a crisp sound.
""Someone who admires you, and... pities you.""
He took a step forward, closing the distance between them.
In the air, the crisp scent of his cologne mixed with the smell of alcohol invaded Jessica's breath.
""What exactly do you want?""
She asked, her voice trembling.
""I want to help you.""
Jose's gaze was intense, ""And help myself.""
He looked at Jessica, his eyes filled with a complex, almost obsessive desire.
Jessica laughed self-mockingly, never imagining that one day she would become a tool in someone else's hands.
Jessica slowly raised her eyes to meet Jose's deep, unfathomable gaze.
""What do you want me to do?""
The corner of Jose's mouth finally curved into a genuine smile.
Without another word, he took her hand and led her away from the nauseating banquet hall.
The car sped along and finally stopped at a top-floor suite of a private club.
Jose took off his suit jacket and tossed it casually onto the sofa.
He walked to the bar and poured two glasses of whiskey.
He handed one to Jessica.
""Drink it to warm up.
Tonight, don't go back.""
His voice echoed in the quiet space, carrying an undeniable command.
Jose gently wrapped his arms around her from behind.
His embrace was warm, carrying an unfamiliar, dangerous aura.
Jessica's body instantly stiffened.
""Don't be afraid.""
He whispered in her ear, his warm breath brushing against her neck.
""If you want revenge, you have to be crueler than them.""
""William could sleep with another woman for the sake of the child, why can't you?""
His hands began to wander restlessly.
Jessica shuddered all over, as if burned, and pushed him away abruptly.
""Don't touch me!""
She retreated to the corner, like a frightened little animal, watching him warily.
Jose wasn't angry; he just stood there, watching her calmly.
""Are you still guarding your chastity for him?""
""Jessica, wake up.""
""In his heart, you're already tainted.""
Those words, like the last straw, completely shattered Jessica's defenses.
Tears welled up uncontrollably.
She crouched down, buried her face in her knees, and let out stifled, painful sobs.
The facade of strength she had maintained for so long crumbled at that moment.
Jose watched her quietly, not approaching.
After who knows how long, the crying gradually subsided.
Jessica slowly lifted her tear-streaked face, her eyes filled with desperate madness.
She stood up and walked step by step to him.
Then, standing on tiptoe, she kissed his lips.
He bent down, picked her up in his arms, and carried her to the large bed.
No lust, no shame.
Only the thrill of revenge.
William
You punished me with betrayal, so I'll repay you with the same betrayal.
Her body was half burning, half ice.

Jessica was seeking a shred of comfort in this unfamiliar embrace, and also using this way to completely sever ties with the past.
Jessica bit her lip hard, stifling any sound.
Scenes from the past flashed before her eyes.
William's love, William's deception, Michelle's insults, Anna's gloating...
Time lost meaning.
When Jessica opened her eyes, her body ached as if taken apart and put back together.
Beside her lay Jose, his face relaxed in sleep.
One arm remained possessively draped across her waist, a silent claim.
She lay still, gazing blankly at the ceiling.
Tears finally slid down silently.
The man beside her stirred at her movement.
Jose opened his eyes, his gaze intense.
He said nothing, only tightened his arm, pulling her closer like a recovered treasure, his hold almost reverent.
In the dimness, his low voice came, carrying a hint of roughness.
""Regrets?""
Jessica lay motionless like a porcelain doll.
At last.
She spoke slowly, ""No regrets.""
From this day forward, love had no place in her world.
William, I hope you can take it.",1,1756014931.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False
1mynq4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mynq4p/pulsating_chirping_at_zero_grinding_very_close_to/,Pulsating chirping at zero + Grinding very close to zero to get good results [Eureka Zero 65 AP],"Hey everyone, I am looking for some guidance on what to do with my brand new (arrived today) Eureka Zero 65 AP.

Edit: Clarification I am using this grinder for espresso primarily

I went to pull some shots and noticed that at the 0 (red) - 0 (black) point resulted in 40g out in 10 seconds. This was with a coffee that I have been using all week on a hand grinder (1zpresso J).  This is a medium roast bean that I would not consider “challenging”/difficult to dial in on.

Watching Tom’s Coffee Corner's review, he reported his zero was at 0 (red) - 14 (black). This gave me some confidence to progressing further down until I found my zero point at 0 (red) - 16.5 (black). However unlike Tom’s grinder the typical 0 point burr chirp sounds uneven/pulsating which I assume is burr misalignment. Additionally similar to Tom’s video, the machine has a loud “wind down” noise after grinding which is a first compared to the previous DF54 I had.

Pulling a shot at 0 (red) - 18 (black), I was able to get a solid 37g in 30 seconds.

Since this grind setting is so close to what I am assuming is the misaligned zero point I am a bit worried about the rather limited range I am left with, if a more challenging bean enters the rotation.

While burr alignment seems to be a common issue with a rather easy fix, I am worried that self aligning the burrs will void the warranty which I’d like to avoid given its brand new. Also would like to retain warranty coverage in case anything else happens.

Before doing anything I'd like an opinion from someone with more experience around the eureka grinders (ideally the Zero 65 AP) about the noises described.

Additionally would aligning the burrs void warranty?  
Should I just return/exchange the grinder back to WLL?

This was a pretty pricey upgrade for our setup so this is a bit of a disappointing experience out of the box.

On one hand, you have my grammy (dad's side) who lives the life she wants to live, hanging with her cacti and snooping on her neighbours. Swearing without regard to the feelings of her mormon son and his mormon wife (my parents). She's awesome. 

On the other, you have my grandma (mum's side), she is awesome too, loves us dearly, tells me to come to church and isn't angry when I let her down politely, tells my friend SHE CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT LIFE! SHE IS WAITING TO DIE! 

I am so tired of this line of thinking! Mormonism makes its members crave death and sometimes destruction. Old people saying they can't wait to die to see heaven and god. Young people saying destruction (wars in middle east/Ukraine) are signs of the beautiful times to come. Yay! /s 

This is wrong. Your life is meant to be filled with beauty, and well, life! Not a craving for death and destruction.

LIFE! 

The great poet Longfellow seemed to unknowingly lambaste mormonism in his famous Psalm of Life: 

""Life is real! Life is earnest!   
*And the grave is not it's goal!*

*...*

Art is long! Time is fleeting! 

And our hearts thou stout and brave

*Still like muffled drums are beating* 

*Funeral marches to the grave.""* 

The greatness of getting out of the death cult of mormonism that worships the end of lives and the end of times is we no longer have to beat the muffled drums of funeral marches from the temple tops and chapel pews. We can focus on something that was of little attention to our past mormon experience: the beauty of true life! 

Now excuse me while I sleep and then wake up with the beautiful aroma of coffee and worshipping the breath of fresh air that nature provides. 

Happy Sunday to all and to all a good night (or morning)! 

On a separate note, any CA exmos in LA or OC? I'm moving there March. I love the beauty of Utah, but I gotta get to my less mo fam there away from this Utah crazytown. ",5,1756014874.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

I know what it’s like to have none of that. I feel a silence that isn’t soft or comforting, but heavy and empty, reminding me that no one will be there at the end of the day, at my wedding, or to share life’s little joys.

Most silence has background noise, like a fan hum, to soften it—but mine is different. It’s a silence that reminds me I don’t have anyone to talk to, that I often have to speak to stuffed animals or ChatGPT just to be heard. It’s a loneliness that makes public spaces feel like I’m the only one alive, talking only to myself.

I know what it feels like to feel different, to feel broken, to feel “too much” or “not normal.” I know what it’s like to act like a little kid sometimes, or to check everything constantly. I know what it’s like to be betrayed and lied to by someone I trusted, and to have my instincts and my feelings dismissed.

Even through all this, I am still here. I hug my stuffed animal, I eat my ice cream, I survive. I do these things not because I am weak, but because I am trying to comfort myself, to hold on to the small pieces of joy and safety I can create.

I am not broken. I am not “too much.” I am someone who feels deeply, who notices the world, who longs for connection and care. I am worthy of love, kindness, and understanding. One day, I will find people—or a dog, or a community—that will see me, hear me, and treasure me for exactly who I am.

Until then, I honor my feelings, my survival, and my strength. I am enough. I am loved, even when it feels like no one is here. And I will keep holding on to myself, step by step.

1mynl7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coconaad/comments/1mynl7k/the_kind_of_love_i_grew_up_with/,The Kind of Love I grew up with!,"Thirty years ago, today, my parents saw each other for the very first time.
It was during a simple pennukaanal set-up.

My mum walked into the room with tea, my dad sat there quietly, and that was it.

No words spoken. No promises made. Just a fleeting glance between two strangers.

At the time, my father was serving in the Army, and life moved quickly.
They didn’t really get to know each other. 

The second time they met was on their wedding day. Two people stepping into a journey with nothing but faith and courage.


As a child, my mornings often began with the sound of my mother’s laughter echoing through the house, sparked by one of my father’s silly jokes.
I would walk into the kitchen to find them cooking together, teasing each other, sharing secrets.

But the moment they noticed me, I would regret it, because that’s when the drama began.
Hugs, kisses, baby voices, endless sweet questions. I would groan in protest, sometimes finding them unusual, sometimes even embarrassing.

But that was them. 

Always loud. 
Always unapologetically themselves.
And maybe that’s why everyone loved being around them.

My friends adored them. 
While I begged them to act normal whenever they visited, within minutes the house would be filled with laughter.
My friends would tell me I was lucky, that my parents were amazing. I didn’t believe them then.

But I do now.

Because I grew up watching the little things that stitched their lives together.
Dad making coffee at midnight because Mum craved it. Roasting peanuts just because she mentioned it once. Sitting together late into the night, whispering and laughing until sleep arrived.

Even their fights had their own kind of beauty. No raised voices. No harsh words. Just honest conversations, spoken with respect. And five minutes later, they were best friends again.
My mother might hold onto her anger for a day or two, but my father, never for more than an hour.

My father has never been good at remembering dates or planning surprises. It has always been me reminding him of their anniversary, my mum’s birthday, and sometimes even his own.
But that was never his love language.

His love is shown in quieter ways.
He listens. He notices. He remembers.
And then, at the most unexpected moments, he buys Mum something she once casually mentioned she liked. 
Not on an occasion. Not for a reason. 
Just because he loves her.

Mum, on the other hand, is the opposite. 
She remembers every important date, surprises him with thoughtful gifts, and above all, spoils him with food, his favorite language. (the man’s the biggest foodie I’ve ever known.)

And though my dad spent over 30 years in the Army, often away from home, my mum was his anchor.
She held families together, stood in for him when he couldn’t be there, and kept things exactly how he would have wanted. 
She was his strength, even in his absence.


As a child, I cringed at their hugs and kisses.
Their baby voices. Their coupley gestures. And how my dad would always take Mum’s photos wherever we went.
(I mean, the woman has always been the star of his gallery, his WhatsApp and Facebook statuses, his phone wallpaper. Always.)


As an adult, now, I know better.

They are the reason I believe in love.
The reason I believe in marriage.
Because I’ve seen, through them, that love doesn’t fade when nurtured with kindness, respect, and joy.

I now realise that their love was rare.
Theirs was not a love born out of grand romance, but one built day by day, through patience, small acts of care, and an unshakable willingness to show affection without shame.

And because I grew up knowing I was deeply loved and very much wanted, I never went looking for love outside.
I never had to seek it from anyone else, because I always knew, without a doubt, that my parents would always be there for me, no matter what.

Because of them, I grew up in a home where love was never quiet.
It was loud, unapologetic, and ever-present.
A home filled with warmth, noise, and endless love.

And for that, I will always, always be forever grateful.

I have 2 half siblings, (6f) and (9m). Since my brother was born, I feel like I have watched my siblings constantly and helped raise them as a 3rd parent, essentially because my dad (40m) and stepmom's (38f) relationship was failing. (I call my stepmom just mom, I've known her since I was hardly 2) Additionally, my little brother has autism. He is almost completely nonverbal and has no obvious sense of danger, awareness, or hygiene. Over the years I have gotten so burnt out. I'm treated like an adult when it's convenient, like watching my siblings, but when I stand up for myself or have opinions I'm suddenly a child. I have had severe problems with my mental health since 7th grade, including SH and SI. I was finally diagnosed with depression in the summer of 2024.

Keeping all this in mind, in August of 2023, my dad initiated a divorce. At first, I felt nothing. I felt a little guilty, but honestly? I had seen it coming. My dad had been sleeping on our couch since at least 2020. Over the remainder of the year, my parents were more and more tense with each other. My mother would make passive aggressive remarks that left me disturbed and uncomfortable, like when she turned down an offer of coffee from my dad saying, ""No thanks. I don't want cyanide in my drink"". My dad would just leave the house to avoid conflict. We were left in stagnancy for reasons unknown to me. All I know is that papers weren't getting signed, lawyers weren't hired, and it resulted in nothing getting done. In December of 2023, the day after Christmas, my parents got into such a genuinely frightening fight (and I later found out DV levels of conflict), that I took my little sister upstairs and tried to distract her the best I could. My brother was in the locked room while my parents were fighting, and I was too scared to approach. I had a panic attack in front of my little sister and we stayed up there for hours until she said she was hungry and I made her lunch.

After New Years, I fell into a horrible depression that resulted in countless relapses of SH. I became addicted and did it almost every other day until I managed to stave it off in mid-March. I was so exhausted, I slept on the floor instead of my bed because I couldn't muster up the energy to climb up into it (I have a loft bed), and I knew if I got in that bed I'd never get up. I had a plan and everything but couldn't follow through because I literally just couldn't even get up to do it. 

Over the spring of 2024, conflict continued. Except instead of arguing behind closed doors, I would physically often be directly in the middle of their arguments. I felt responsible for my siblings and tried in 3 different instances to talk to one or both of my parents about keeping conflict between them and away from us. In every single one, my mom shut me down and said I was too young to understand and that I was being indoctrinated by my dad. My dad would get frustrated and try to tell me everything was going to be okay soon, and that stuff will get figured out and that it wouldn't be like this forever.

In the summer of 2024, I fell into depression again and planned a picnic to say goodbye to all my friends without them knowing so that when I followed through with my plan, they wouldn't feel bad. Long story short, it didn't work out and I was practically bedridden again. Well, floor-ridden. Later, in July 2024, my aunt who came to visit from France saw my active SH and told my dad. My dad made me show him and then immediately made an appointment with a psychologist. That's when I was diagnosed with depression. In August of 2024, I was prescribed antidepressants and my dad took me with him to live in an Airbnb close to my school. He said the house I was in before was a horrible place to be, and that it wasn't healthy for me to be there even if I was under close supervision.

Fall and Winter of 2024, I spent my days living with my dad in an Airbnb and moving out/in every month or so. I could count the times I saw my mom during that time on one hand. However, my dad basically used me as his therapist. I guess I presented as emotionally stable and supportive enough to handle nearly every thought he had about the ""divorce"" so far, (at that time, nothing had been done still. Over a year and no temporary orders, nothing.) This has been impeding our relationship to this very day. I feel like a vent space, more than his child. Eventually, by spring of 2025, lawyers were involved and things were 'getting done' divorce wise. Mediation failed back in 2024 so the court date was pushed from October of 2024 to February of 2025. Surprise!! Nothing got done and another continuance was put in. And another!! And another! During this time, because of miscommunications between me and my dad, I was constantly (unintentionally) going cold turkey off my antidepressants. (100 mg sertraline) I had already started relapsing since the start of January 2025 and pulled myself out again around early March.

TO THIS DAY things are not settled with this divorce. I help with my siblings every day, manage tension between me and my mom since I've moved back into the original house, (the Airbnb was too expensive to maintain. I'm back at square one.) and act as my dad's confidantae all at once. I'm so done. I've talked to them both so many times about the parentification, emotional incest, and more (terms provided by my lovely therapist). Nothing has changed! All my friends have moved away for college and I have no car, I have no job. I am stuck. I need to leave and even if I can, I don't know how I will ever be on good terms with any of my immediate family again.

Like, when I think about my best friend who's die-hard about one particular coffee brand, it feels like there's an emotional comfort at play. She always says it reminds her of home, kinda like how folks find solave in their childhood teddy beas. Maybe there's this underlynig need for stability or nostalgia?

There's also the aspect of social identity to consider. You know how we atach ourselves to brands that we feel represent us? It's like when someone chooses an eco-friendly brsnd, part of it is about shoiwng alignment with their vaalues – but could it also be about a deeper urge to be part of a group or community? It makes me think that perhaps these branding choices are also about fulfilliing a need to belpng.

I guess what I’m trying to say is, maybe our choices have bigger narratives intertwiend with who we are and what we seek in relationships...be it with people or proeucts. Anyone else ever thought about this stuff too? 🤔",10,1756013543.0,InvisibleMotives,0,1.0,False

1myn6qi,https://www.reddit.com/r/malementalhealth/comments/1myn6qi/i_suck_at_getting_girls_and_think_ill_just/,I suck at getting girls and think I'll just forever be alone. Need support,"28M, Years and years of trying and still I suck at talking to girls and getting dates and when I do, I end up not really being interested. I've approached hundreds and hundreds of girls, gotten tons of numbers, 90% have flaked, and the very few dates I have gotten, things just haven't progressed for one reason or another. When I talk to women, they are almost never interested. I've talked to women at parks, coffee shops, bars, clubs, etc... Also tried OLD. Nothing. Years and years trying to overcome this and the only thing I have to show for it is just a few dates over the past 6 years.

I think I just suck at flirting. Whenever I approach a girl, I can't seem to get their interest well enough to get them to later respond to my text messages or even give me their phone number most of the time. Clubs are the hardest. Groups avoid me on the dance floor. I don't know how to enter in and I awkwardly try but I get blocked. Even when I do talk to people I bore them so much with the boring shit I talk about that I end up being rejected. I know some techniques for flirting like playful arrogance and cold reads but I just don't feel like I can do those things cause 95% of the time it comes out super awkward and scripted and the women instantly feel that.

Today I tried to go out with some friends(who all came with their girlfriends). I honestly didn't want to go where they were going. I'm a salsa dancer and I wanted to dance with other salsa dancers at bar where they were having a Latin night where I know salsa dancers go but when they went there they said it was empty and to go to the other place. I begrudgingly said yes because they were already at that other place. I also didn't want to go because yesterday night I had already gone to another clubby Latin place and didn't feel like going to another one tonight. I wanted to go to a place where people dance for real.

 But I decided to go there because I just didn't want to stay home. So I spent the money for the Uber to go there. I get there and my friends were just dancing with the girls and not really laying much attention to me so I tried to go off and do my own thing but I was too chicken shit to approach groups of girls on the dance floor and when kinda tried once I got blocked off. I didn't try again because this has happened to me a million times at clubs and already knew that if I tried to get in that I was going to be ignored at best. So I ended up just standing there scanning the room and looking for other girls cause honestly I didn't care about anything else. Not the club, not the music. I danced with someone for a bit but I was just too uncomfortable and awkward. I told one of the friends that I wasn't feeling it and just went home.

Seeing those people are the club just made me feel more alone and given that I suck with women and have failed to get anything going after years of trying and sometimes I feel like I just want to end my life because I think I am going to always be awkward, boring, and undesirable to women.

And yes, I have hobbies. I have an otherwise ""good life"". I make $120K a year, live in the middle of a big city, renting a nice apartment that I can afford, I have hobbies like salsa dancing, traveling, and gaming and I am trying to explore more, money and time permitting. I workout and although I don't have a six pack, I'm relatively fit and have muscles so that's not an issue. I also just got back into therapy for the 4th time.

I just feel extremely hopeless right now. I have failed in ways that I think most people didnt have to fail. Most men didnt have to try for several years approaching hundreds of girls just to get one person. Most men don't consistently turn women off by trying to be flirty in an attempt to not be be seen as boring. Most men figured out all of this shit, have been in relationships, are comfortable sexually, and have had a few sexual encounters. I on the other hand, am not any of these things. I'm too afraid of being humiliated and failing in the bedroom to even get close to having a casual encounter. I have had no relationships, and the only two sexual encounters I've had were so awkward that I couldn't even finish and they ended up making me feel worse afterwards. I just feel like shit and have extremely little hope that things are going to get any better.",0,1756012987.0,malementalhealth,2,0.5,False

Woke up on a Monday, sun in my eyes
Coffee's brewing, trying to feel wise
Checked my phone, a message from a dude
Asking for money, said I owed him food
From a pizza we split back in '09
My brain went ""huh?"" then drew a hard line
Hit me with a feeling, sharp, quick, and true
That automatic, visceral, ""What the fuck you.""

It's not an insult, not a heated fight
Just a natural reaction to a strange sight
It's that pivot from confused to a hard shut-down
A brand new phrase in this weird little town
You feel the shock, the surprise, the sudden dismay
Then your whole self turns, pushes you away
Starts with ""What the..."" then you switch into view
The simple, elegant, ""What the fuck you.""

Saw an influencer hawking some new green tea
Said it could make me live my life care-free
The bottle was empty, the promise was loud
She was just faking for the whole dumb crowd
My eyebrows went up, my jaw dropped a bit
Then my mind said, ""Nope, not falling for it.""
My face went blank, the feeling came through
That pure and simple, ""What the fuck you.""

It's not an insult, not a heated fight
Just a natural reaction to a strange sight
It's that pivot from confused to a hard shut-down
A brand new phrase in this weird little town
You feel the shock, the surprise, the sudden dismay
Then your whole self turns, pushes you away
Starts with ""What the..."" then you switch into view
The simple, elegant, ""What the fuck you.""

Mutter it low, under your breath
Right at the moment you’re facing a test
A strange request, a bizarre demand
Something you just can’t understand
It’s not for them, it's a feeling for you
A little rebellion, a moment of ""screw you""

Yeah... ""What the fuck you.""
It’s a mood. It’s a vibe.
It’s a whole damn lifestyle.
Don't get it? That's fine.
It's not for everyone...
But for those who know... you know.

Before getting a job, I merely regarded it as something I needed to learn, as a means for me to establish myself in the future. Even when looking for a job, I found myself needing the help of a beyz interview helper during the interview process. I’ll spend an extra hour refactoring a perfectly functional query into layered CTEs with meaningful names, consistent indentation, and little comments to guide future-me (or whoever inherits it, not that anyone ever reads them). My manager just wants the revenue number and I need the query to *feel* architecturally sound.  

The dopamine hit when I replace a tangled nest of subqueries with clean `WITH` blocks? Honestly better than coffee. It’s like reorganizing a messy closet that nobody else looks inside and *I* know it’s beautiful.  

Meanwhile, stakeholders refresh dashboards every five minutes without caring whether the query behind it looks like poetry or spaghetti. Sometimes I wonder if I’m developing a professional skill or just indulging my own nerdy procrastination.  

I’ve even started refactoring other people’s monster 500-line single SELECTs into readable chunks when things are slow. I made a personal SQL style guide that literally no one asked for.

I have been with my boyfriend for two years now, we met in a coffee shop and on our first date he took me to his 10million worth of a vacation house. He's smart, kind, generous, and a romantic man— all these apart from his physique that I also admired since then.

After watching the movie Materialists, I realized that I am lucky and blessed to have him; a business deal and a real love in one package. He is a mix of Harry and John. 

He made me feel valuable for all the days we have been together. He makes good food, take me to beautiful places, listen to me every single time, helped me with lots of things plus a six pack abs and a nice biceps.

Now, I am just praying and thanking God for giving me a man like in this lifetime. ",2,1756012201.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

And why I had to hide in a cupboard when I saw Charles. Intimate revelations by GRANT HARROLD","By GRANT HARROLD **Published:** 20:54 EDT, 15 August 2025 | **Updated:** 20:54 EDT, 15 August 2025

Catching the Queen's eye as she chatted to guests in the drawing room at Birkhall, the Prince of Wales's summer retreat in Aberdeenshire, I let her know that dinner was served. 'Oh, very good,' she said and immediately started walking with me along the corridor leading to the dining room. Suddenly, she stopped, went back and, looking into the drawing room, saw that everyone, including Charles and Camilla, was still talking. No one had made a move to follow her. 'Right,' she said, 'we will see about that.'

The next thing I knew, she bolted along the corridor. She might have been in a gown and dress shoes and in her 80s, but she actually ran. I didn't know what to do. Where in the butler's manual does it say what you are supposed to do when a monarch starts running? There was nothing else for it but to speed after her, half skipping along as she kept up her pace and ran around to her chair at the table. After I'd helped her get seated, she looked at me and then at her watch. The next thing we heard was the thunderous noise of everyone else running along to save face, as etiquette dictated that they should have been with her when she left the room. As everyone, including Charles and Camilla, practically fell over themselves into the dining room, Her Majesty looked at me and winked. As always, it was an absolute honour to be in her presence, but you never knew what was going to happen next. It was one of the little things that amused her and showed the fun, mischievous side which she shared with her eldest son.

I first began working for the future king in April 2004. Then 25, I was a working-class boy from Airdrie, an industrial town some 17 miles east of Glasgow, and I had long been fascinated by the monarchy. So much so that, when I was three, I asked for a dolls' house for Christmas and placed in it little clay characters I imagined were the Queen and the Royal Family. After leaving school, I joined the housekeeping staff at the Scottish country estate owned by a Swiss banker and from there I worked my way up to become butler at Woburn Abbey, the family seat of the Duke of Bedford. Then came the opportunity to work for Prince Charles at Highgrove, which is near Tetbury in Gloucestershire.

After passing five interviews with different members of the Prince's team, I was summoned to Clarence House to meet the man himself. I was terrified but somehow I managed to remain composed and two days later I was offered the job. Arriving at Highgrove on Easter Saturday, I settled into my accommodation, a cold and rather damp little cottage once occupied by Princess Diana's butler Paul Burrell. But after only a couple of days I flew up to Scotland, to be with Charles and Camilla who were on holiday at Birkhall. Along with other members of staff, I was picked up at Aberdeen airport by Charles's head butler Fred and as we drove into the grounds of the white-fronted 18th-century house, he spotted our employer in the grounds. 'It's the Prince,' he said. 'Everyone has to bow.'

Instinctively, we all lowered our heads. Seconds later, we pulled up at the back of the house and, sure enough, there was His Royal Highness striding towards us, dressed in his familiar country tweeds. 'Is everything OK?' he said. 'I just saw a car driving and there was nobody in it.' 'Ah, yes, sir, we were bowing,' the butler explained. 'I see,' he smiled before carrying on his way.

The following morning, as I did some tidying on the ground floor, I saw Charles and Camilla at the end of a corridor and for some reason I froze. Nobody had explained to me the etiquette if I bumped into them. Was I allowed to speak to them, or should I wait until spoken to? If I didn't engage, would that appear rude? Unsure of what to do, I noticed a door on my right-hand side and ducked inside, realising too late that it was a cupboard used to store drinks and glassware, all rattling loudly when I shut the door behind me.

Not to worry, I thought. They probably didn't even notice me in the corridor. I thought I'd give it a few seconds and come out when the coast was clear but then I heard footsteps and voices getting louder as they stopped outside the door. Scared to breathe, I prayed they would keep walking. 'Do you think he's OK?' So much for not being seen. And they must know what's in here. 'I wonder what he's looking for,' Camilla chuckled. 'Do you think he's having a drink?' 'Do you think he's going to come out?' said the Prince of Wales.

Any thoughts of styling this out were long gone. I opened the door, bowed my head and said: 'Good morning, Your Royal Highnesses.' Both were grinning widely. Without waiting for a response, I opened a door opposite which, thankfully, led to a staircase and bolted back to the sanctuary of the butler's pantry. As Charles and Camilla sat down for breakfast, I could hear them giggling that the newest member of the team was so panicked, he'd dived into a cupboard. It was nice that I had made them laugh and I felt relaxed that I'd entered such a comfortable environment. That was when I'd had time to reflect . . . and the mortification had finally worn off.

Two weeks after arriving at Birkhall, I celebrated my 26th birthday. Being new to the team, I did not expect any fuss to be made but Charles and Camilla gave me a card and a gift, a large, round chocolate coin which was the size of a side plate and bore the head of Queen Victoria. It was very sweet, because they didn't have to give me anything, and I was extremely grateful.

After a very pleasant and enjoyable stay at Birkhall, we returned to Highgrove where, as with every new house, it was important to learn the daily routine, starting at 7.30am with the 'calling trays' laid out with tea or coffee and biscuits, and the newspaper. Between 8am and 10am there was breakfast, and between 11am and noon it was elevenses. From noon to 12.30pm there were pre-lunch drinks, then from 12.30 to 2.30pm it was lunch. Between 2pm and 3pm there was more coffee, from 4pm it was afternoon tea, and at 6.30pm we set up for pre-dinner drinks. Dinner was from 8pm to 10pm, or there might be supper at 9pm. The only thing people must be ready for after all that, I thought, was WeightWatchers.

One day, I was chatting to the chef when someone appeared at the kitchen door and, without warning, hurled something wet and rubbery in my direction. Realising who and what it was, I did a double-take. OK, I thought, so this is happening... Prince Harry has just arrived home and I'm getting a water balloon thrown at me. I hadn't yet met Harry, who was then 19, and there was nothing I could do but dive into a larder at the back of the kitchen and climb outside via a small window covered with netting to stop the flies getting in.

I could scarcely believe what I was doing and, as soon as I hit the ground, another balloon smacked me on the back, soaking my shirt. I looked up to see that Harry had run upstairs and was throwing them from a window. I ran around the house and bumped into him as I came back inside. 'Sorry,' he said, 'I'm just being a bit silly.' And that was my introduction to Prince Harry.

At the time he was on a gap year before he applied to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst for officer training and, as a result, I saw less of him than I did his brother. Prince William was friendly, polite and straight to the point. He told me that I could call him William, which felt like a big deal because not many people addressed him purely by his first name. William was, of course, dating Kate Middleton at this time and it wasn't long before I met her too. I was downstairs in the butler's pantry when they came in. Again, it was all very relaxed and informal as I introduced myself, and she replied, 'I'm Kate.' She was very polite, sweet and personable. What I liked about William and Kate was that it took a while to build up their trust. With Prince Charles, it had begun right away, but with his elder son it took about six months to a year to build up the relationship to a point where he felt comfortable.

That summer we decamped to Sandringham in Norfolk for the annual flower show. I had never seen such a massive mansion and it was like being in a time capsule, with the antique wardrobe and bed in my sparsely furnished single room still stamped with the 'VR' cypher of Queen Victoria. Working in the butler's pantry one day, I noticed a Velux window in the ceiling through which you could see all the way to a valet room upstairs. Another butler told me that Princess Diana used to look down to the pantry and pull faces at the staff to make them laugh. I could imagine her doing something that, but it was also strange and sad to think that she used to be up there looking down.

Like their mother, Princes William and Harry showed such natural warmth and compassion, and never more so than when children who would be spending Christmas in a hospice came to Highgrove to meet the Royal Family and decorate a tree. It was heartbreaking but also uplifting to see the joy on their young faces as they met the young princes. Camilla, too, was there and, equally, was so sweet with them all. The children loved it.

At that year's staff Christmas party, I was caught up in a water fight instigated by William in the salubrious surroundings of St James's Palace. I was delighted to see that he was on my table. It was the first time I'd really had a chance to speak to him, and it was lovely to find him so down to earth and approachable. Then he and another member of staff started filling up water balloons and firing them at each other over the table. It was hilarious. Everyone was in fits of laughter. It was like hanging out with any young man, except this one was a future king.

Another royal residence we visited regularly was the Castle of Mey on the far north coast of Scotland, a property Prince Charles had inherited from the late Queen Mother. On my first trip there, we went up on the Queen's Flight, a special private jet for the use of the Queen and her family, but, just as I was thinking I could get used to this lifestyle, we hit really bad turbulence and I have never wanted to get off a plane quicker.

Without thinking, I got up and made for the exit as soon as it was safe to do so on landing. It was then I noticed a little mirror by the door. That's quite handy, I thought, being able to check your appearance before you disembark. The crew opened the door and I got a shock to see lots of flashes going off below. It was the Press, there to welcome Prince Charles's arrival. A voice behind me said: 'Oh, I think that's for me.'

Mortified, I stood back and let His Royal Highness go first, making a mental note not to walk off a plane before the boss. As soon as it was acceptable to do so, I rushed down the steps and headed for the nearest toilet. As I discovered at the Castle of Mey, the royal staff loved playing pranks on each other, and Prince Charles was often in on the fun. Retiring to my room one night, I nearly jumped out of my skin when, behind the bedroom door, I saw a figure in royal uniform. My considerate colleagues had taken a mannequin that had been standing in the kitchen and put it in my room. Only now could I hear peals of laughter echoing up the stairwell.

The following morning, I was serving the Prince breakfast and he asked if I had slept well. 'Yes, sir,' I said, feeling my cheeks starting to burn. 'I thought I heard something,' he said. 'Yes sir,' I said. 'I screamed last night because a mannequin had been put behind my door. It's normally in the kitchen. Somebody put it in my room to scare me because we'd been telling ghost stories.

'No!' he said, then burst out laughing. 'I knew all about it,' he told me. Camilla has a great sense of humour too. When we returned to Birkhall soon afterwards, she told me that she had encountered two American tourists while out walking by Lochnagar, the mountain to the south of the River Dee. They let her know that when you're out walking in the area, there's a good chance you might see members of the Royal Family. 'Oh, I'll need to keep a look-out then,' she'd told them. They'd had no idea who they were talking to.

I would never tire of being privy to such little moments with Charles and Camilla – but sometimes they bordered on the bizarre, as when the Prince was trying to create anarchway made of antlers outside Birkhall. As he tried to attach the antlers to the woven wire arches, they were swinging backwards and forwards and I got the call to come and help him. Bloody hell, I thought, the future king is going to be impaled. Either that, or I will be! Somehow, we managed to secure them without skewering each other. It was yet another moment with the Royal Family I could never have imagined experiencing. And, as I will describe in tomorrow's Mail on Sunday, there were many more to come.

1mymsve,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mymsve/i_watched_my_neighbor_ms_katz_die_then_killed_her/,"I watched my neighbor Ms. Katz die, then killed her six days later.","When I first met my neighbor, Ms. Katz, she scared the shit out of me.

I was walking up the cracked sidewalk to her front door to introduce myself because I had just finished moving in and wanted to start getting to know my neighbors. The house was uniquely large compared to all of the other homes on the street; adorned with steep slanted roofs and vertical wooden framing, a cacophony of plants bursting over the back yard fence on either side.

It was the house that ended the street; the pavement of the road and sidewalk abruptly cut off into grass.

The door was thick wood that looked like it weighed a ton. The brass gargoyle door knocker rapped loudly, echoing into the house as I stood for a moment waiting for a reply. I jumped when a creaky voice from my left said,

“Hello there Deary.” I turned to look down at a cheery old woman’s face that was wrinkled in a closed-eyed smile. I was startled, it felt like she had scared me on purpose.

The backyard gate slammed shut and I noticed that the old woman was wiping dirt off of her hands; she must have been gardening. “Hello to you as well! I just moved in next door.” I said, trying to be friendly.

“Welcome to Belmont Avenue, my name is Catrina Katz, just call me Katz deary.” She opened her eyes and continued smiling, but I was taken aback again. Her eyes were yellow. Very yellow. They looked like sickly saucers of spoiled milk. My apprehension turned to empathy for Ms.Katz - yellow eyes can mean liver problems, something my own grandmother had struggled with it for years.

“I just wanted to say hello, I am going to go get back to unpacking, you should come over for dinner sometime! Nice meeting you,” I said.

“I’m sure I will deary,” Ms.Katz said, then she turned back towards the backyard gate, glancing one more time at me before getting to her gardening, and I went back to my new home, which was filled with boxes that needed my attention.

That night I slept poorly, the house was dead quiet, the only noise was the air conditioning unit kicking on every once in a while.

I am a very light sleeper, so that’s why I woke up when a strange noise started permeating through the edges of my sleepy consciousness.

There was a sound so quiet that a normal person would have slept through it*.* I lay covered in my bed, sensitive ears straining to discern what the noise was. It sounded like someone was digging in mud.

I sat up, trying to quiet my breathing so I could hear where it was coming from, but my wooden floors made the sound reverberate from all directions in my room. I could not work up the courage to get out bed and investigate, something told me I should just lay down and put on some white noise to ignore it.

Every night for a week did just that, ignoring the noise and getting some decent sleep.

When I asked my other neighbor Todd - a nice middle-aged truck driver- one day if he had heard the noise he said he didn’t know anything about it,

“I bet you it’s Ms. Katz. You can catch her out pretty late sometimes. Between you and me, I think she has a bit of dementia. Just a bit. She loves her gardening. I’ve even seen her doing it at night which is weird but to each their own. She must love it. She imports special fertilizer all the time. Here comes a truck now.” He nodded towards her house.

A van pulled into the driveway. It had a purple flower logo on the metal siding that was indeed befitting of a fertilizer company. A burly man dressed in all black greeted Ms. Katz at her gate and started carrying brown sacks into her back yard. She noticed us watching and gave a cheery wave to us, while we waved back Todd said,

“Really sweet woman. I’ve known her for years. She’s been living on Belmont Avenue as long as anyone can remember. Makes great apple pie.”

I decided to see the garden for myself that afternoon.

I made it look like I was cleaning my gutters, which to be fair, were disappointingly dirty no thanks to my landlord. I stood up on my roof to peer over the bushes spilling into my back yard, only then realizing what a jungle Ms. Katz’s backyard was. Bushes, flowers, vines, short and tall trees, birdbaths, stone pathways, you name it. If Ms. Katz was really doing it all herself, it had to have taken up all of her time. The garden was in pristine condition and scattered throughout the yard were the large brown fertilizer sacks, some ripped open with black soil spilling out.

There was a smell that rose out of the backyard and drifted towards me as I studied the garden. A sickly-sweet stench that was quite pungent. I could see lavender, rose and dracaena flowers so I did not second guess the origin of the smell, but a part of my brain was reminded at the time of how my grandfather’s large liquid fly traps smelled when they were full to the brim with dead insects.

An itch on the back of my neck grew while I was scouting. It took me a minute to notice the yellow eyes peering at me between large purple curtains out of the corner of my vision. I was startled and turned to look back at Ms.Katz, unsure of how long she had been staring at me. She waved and smiled, nodding towards her garden like It was quite special before going inside.

I couldn’t be sure but before I turned to face her I could’ve sworn she was looking at me with a face contorted in utter hatred.

It was 9 nights ago when I watched Ms. Katz die.

When I woke, I was confused. I could make out the soft noise from nights before that still somehow demanded every ounce of my attention. I looked to my nightstand and realized my phone was not playing my white noise, I must have forgotten to turn it on.

I decided it was time to confront Ms. Katz. If she really did have dementia, maybe I could just talk to her and she would realize she should be asleep and not doing whatever weird shit she was doing in the middle of the night.

I crept through the house, slowly opening the back door. The sound of crickets and rustling leaves mixed with the digging noise that was now sharp and clear. I could not stop myself from approaching a peephole in the fence.

When I was a few spans from the fence the sound suddenly stopped. I froze, waiting. A rhythmic thumping noise started coming down over the fence. What was she up to now? I had to know what she was doing. One eye closed, I peered through the hole into the back yard. 

The back yard looked like it did when I last saw it, winding stone paths now illuminated by moonlight. More fertilizer bags were open and the garden beds were torn up like plants were being rearranged.

I quickly found her. Ms.Katz was on a ladder pulling at one of the fertilizer bags which was stuck in one of her second story windows. Pulling does not properly describe the motion. Ms. Katz was throwing her body weight faster than what seemed possible away from the window, the bag inching with each heave. She thrashed again and again and again. It looked like it hurt. It looked like her arms should have dislocated.

I started panicking, clearly Ms. Katz had more than “a little bit of dementia” like Todd had said. I needed to help her, to get her to a hospital and make sure she was mentally sound. But it was too late.

Suddenly Ms. Katz lost her grip on the bag, the cloth tearing from the tensile force, and in an instant was falling off of the ladder. She was weightless, air whipping her stained nightgown about while she plummeted. A pit formed in my stomach when I saw where she would land, the inevitable becoming more terrifying with each second.

*SPLAT.*

One of the short concrete bird baths that had a pointed house had completely pierced the abdomen of the elderly woman. I stood frozen while I processed what was happening.

Not a single cry was uttered. Her death was instant, a hole the size of a basketball oozing blood where her stomach had been made me fall to knees and retch into the grass.

I grabbed my phone and dialed 911 as I started frantically searching for my dinky ass Walgreens first aid kit. An operator picked up.

The operator asked in a calm voice,

""911 what is your emergency?""

“My neighbor is dead! She fell off a ladder and impaled herself on a bird bath!"" I yelled, panting as I sprinted down the sidewalk.

The operator was clearly used to these kinds of calls, “Ok slow down sir. What is the address?”

“414 Belmont Avenue. Please hurry! Please!” I stammered out as fast as I could,

“What is her name sir?”

“Catrina Katz. She’s bleeding please-”

“Sir, is this a joke?”

“What do you mean? I’m telling you the truth”

I stopped in my tracks. I was so high on adrenaline I couldn’t understand what was happening.

“We’ve had at least eight calls like this in the past year. Ms. Katz has always been fine when we respond.”

“I don’t understa-“

“She is an elderly lady who does not need this harassment. I will not repeat myself. If you call again, I am sending an officer to arrest you for misuse of the 911 line. Goodbye.” The operator hung up.

The only sound left was my heavy breathing. I found myself walking towards the backyard gate, my momentum was the only thing that kept me going.

I pushed open the gate, scanning the backyard. There was no ladder laying on the ground.  Ms.Katz was gone. Somehow she was not skewered on the bird bath as she had been a minute ago. I kept moving forward, unable to stop myself from approaching the bird bath.

It was clean, its undisturbed state mocked my fear and panic. There was no blood, but when I touched the concrete bird bath house, it was warm.

I felt a pit in my stomach; the world was spinning around me. My head was pounding.

“Deary, what are you doing this time of night?” a sweet voice said, I whipped around. I felt like I was sinking into hysteria. 

The back door stood open, the wooden arch frame filled by Ms. Katz’s figure. There was no obvious sign of a gaping stomach wound, she appeared to have just woken up. She was looking at me, concern plain on the wrinkles of her face.

I could see into the house. A few old lamps were turned on. I could just make out old some ornate furniture covered in dust. The inside of the house certainly matched the outside.

There was something that caught my eye. It was one of the large fertilizer bags with the purple flower logo. Torn open and spilling over a wooden table onto the floor, the bag was not full of black soil. The bag was full of a bright flesh, indiscriminate chunks glistening in the lamp light.

“DEAR! I SAID ARE YOU OK?”, Ms. Katz yelled, snapping my eyes away from the bag of flesh. She was no longer a sweet old woman who wanted to make sure I was alright, her yellow eyes were strained open, demanding an answer from me, an explanation,

“I uh… I thought…” I stood there, mouth working, I couldn’t think. “I heard some commotion, I wanted to make sure everything was alright,” I stammered out, it seemed impossible that I was talking to someone that I just saw die. I felt nauseous. Doubt was flooding my mind. Was this real? Was I dreaming?

Ms. Katz’s face eased into her usual sweet smile,

“No commotion deary. I promise you everything is alright. Go back home and get some rest. I am sure you will forget all about it in the morning” She looked at me, still smiling, but the smile did not reach her eyes, “it’s late. People go missing at night so you better be careful.”

She turned and slammed the door.

I did not sleep that night. Instead, I turned on every light in the house and locked myself in my bedroom. I played the events of the night over and over again in my head. Every time I convinced myself it was real, I would convince myself I must have dreamed it; had some kind of lucid nightmare. But nightmares don’t leave 911 calls on your phone history or dirt strung throughout your house. Nightmares don’t live next door.

In my shaken state come morning the only thing to do was to go to work. Work was consistent, and I figured it would sort things out for me to pretend everything was normal.

After I downed a third cup of coffee I strode out the door, the sun catching on morning fog welcomed me to a new day.

Todd stepped out of his door right after me. We nodded to each other, Todd’s expression soured when he saw something behind me. “None of my damn business,” Todd grumbled around a cigarette in his lips. I turned to see what he had seen.

A van with a large purple flower logo was backed up to Ms. Katz’s house, a few men unloading fertilizer bags. A part of me wanted to be drawn back into the events of last night. I pushed it down.

I decided Todd was right. It was not any of my business.

A full day of work set me back to a sense of normalcy. Pushing pencils for eight hours really clears your mind.

That night was silent, and I slept sounder than a hibernating bear without the need for a white noise machine. I waved to Ms. Katz when I saw her on my excursions out of the house. She often was garbed in gardening clothes, going in and out of her backyard. None of my business. For six days all was well.

Until I woke up three nights ago, soaked in sweat, muffled screaming filling my room.

I once had a friend of mine lose his arm. We were playing on some rocks in a forest during a camping trip, jumping back and forth between larger boulders, taking turns giving chase to one another. I was laughing while I chased my friend, both of us grinning ear to ear while we played.

My friend was climbing higher and higher up the slope of the mountain, taking each gap in one big stride at a time, taunting me to catch him. Just before my little pointer finger could reach out and tag him, he lost his footing and slipped.

I watched as my friend fell towards the ground below, and stood frozen as he began screaming in pain, bloody arm raised in the air, bone snapped in half at the forearm, sharp white bone dangling in two directions.

I had never heard so much pain expressed before. My friend screamed until his voice was raw, thrashing about on a rock below. If I had acted sooner, running down the mountain to grab our parents, my friend might have saved his arm. But as a kid I just stood frozen to the spot, unable to move.

I was frozen then, in my bed, as I listened to the pain unfolding before me.

“Help me please! Oh god! Oh god!”, it was muffled, the words could just barely be made out, but the pain was sharp and visceral.

A part of me wanted to roll over, turn on the white noise machine, and pretend I hadn’t heard anything. But I knew what I was going to do.

I grabbed a knife from the kitchen, forcing myself to take one step after another towards the house next door. There was no doubt this time. This was real. I needed to be braver, to not freeze, to help this person. The screaming grew clearer as I approached the house, slid through the gate and approached the back door.

“I’m so sorry! I promise….” the voice screeched. It was definitely coming from her house, I had to stop whatever was going on. I reached for the door,  knife held at the ready, swallowing when my hand grabbed the knurled knob and began to twist.

“I cant! I..”, the yelling suddenly cut off, stillness now deafening. Somehow the hinges of the door slid across each other smoothly, silently revealing the darkness of the house. Once inside, I let out the breath I hadn’t realized I was holding as quietly as possible.

I moved through the room, past the old furniture, subconsciously aware of the bags of flesh strewn about, of the smell of death so rank I would normally empty the contents of my stomach. Passing old pieces of furniture covered in must, I found myself walking on kitchen tile, then rounding a doorway to face a steep wooden stairway.

Time started falling forwards on a fixed track, I was floating up the stairs. I barely noticed the loud thud that sounded like a deflated basketball was dropped.

Heat radiated from above, I was entering a tropical oven. The plaster of the walls was damp and rotted, wood molding visible in bare patches. A squelching noise started coming from upstairs and washing down over me.

I continued to move slowly towards the noise. At the top of the stairs was a hallway with closed side rooms and an open door at the end of the hall, the room behind the door illuminated by a sickly yellow ceiling light creeping out into the hall. Before I knew it I swung the door open, revealing the horrible scene inside.

It has taken me these days since that night to rationalize what I saw behind the door at the end of the hallway. In the moment my brain put my body into shock, I continued to act but was not comprehending how absolutely horrifying it all was.

The floor was covered in dirt and flesh. The two substances were mixed together to form a paste that was thick and gelatinous.

Ms. Katz’s head was staring at me, upside down in the mush, eyeless sockets fixed in my direction. The decapitated head looked something like a pale Jack-O-Lantern after weeks in the sun, all of the flesh had been scooped out from the inside. I could see through the eye sockets into the pale skull. The base of the head where the neck should be revealed a perfectly calcified circle that looked like a doll head might when you wrung it off of the body, a spacious cavity where a brain should be.

I peeled my eyes from the ground and looked forward.

A table was in the middle of the room. The rest of Ms. Katz was hunched over the table sitting on an old wooden stool. Her body was convulsing as something I couldn’t see was ripping into the chest of a dead body sprawled on the table. It must have been the person I had gone to save. Slurping and crunching filled the room.

There was screaming, it took me a second to realize that I was screaming.

Slowly the rest of Ms.Katz sat up from the table in the chair, out of the stump of her neck what looked like a slender frayed rope started stretching upward towards the ceiling. Brown and glistening like an insect carapace, slowly its head started rising from the dead body on the table, pulled upward until it was almost touching the ceiling. Tendrils roughly a foot in length sprouted like fuzzy antenna in all directions along the vine-like neck; they constantly moved and twitched as they felt their surroundings.

The head was covered in the same wriggly feelers, blacker than those on the neck. Once the head had risen almost five feet in the air, towering above me as an unholy obelisk, it twisted around to stare down at me.

Insect mandibles twitched and chomped, flesh smeared and stuck to the mouth area, falling down to the ground with thick splashes. The head was smaller than the discarded shell of a head on the ground by my feet, but the eyes were the same. The yellow eyes were large, bulging out of the hard carapace, no eyelids to conceal their bulbus shape. Its eyes were fixed on me, pure malice penetrating me to my core.

The next few moments occurred in the blink of an eye. Rapidly the tendrils of the neck started pulling the creature back into Ms. Katz. Each tendril would shoot down into the old woman’s body, accelerating the head downward. Sporadic jerks animated the her corpse, arms shooting out, a seizure of movements unfolding before me until the insectoid head was the only visible part of the parasite, resting on the body’s neck stump.

All was still, a standoff had begun. In shock I was rooted to the spot, a pit of dread opened up in my stomach and I became aware of my heart pounding in my ears.

It leaped toward me, pushing off the ground so hard I heard the floor break, crashing into me with force enough to break my ribs, sending us hurtling back through the hall way towards the stairs. On the ground we struggled, I somehow managed to grab its shoulders and pushed with all of my strength as it tried to pop my head open with its layers of jaws.

A full throated roar came out of me and I heaved us down the stairs. Each step smacked on the way down, at the bottom I rolled into the kitchen onto my back. I had broken ribs and an ankle twisted the wrong direction, so all I could do was crawl backwards from the stairwell door, where I could hear snapping sounds that meant it was getting up.

It forced Ms.Katz body to its feet, one arm disolacted and jutting upward, standing naked in the dark doorway. A fleshy stomach hole was filled with twisted knots of insectoid spaghetti where the bird bath had pierced through the body.  Its eyes were two yellow orbs of light swaying back and forth in the darkness of the doorway.

I noticed a shovel at my feet and frantically grabbed for it. I was too late. In the same moment I made my move, some of the knotted tendrils of Ms. Katz’s stomach wound shot out towards me.

The wet tendrils were thick and flew across the kitchen, striking my left shoulder and digging into my flesh. The muscles of the arm seized. My muscles were forced to contract harder than my brain would allow. Every single muscle cramped at the same time. My biceps relaxed as my triceps continued to flex which caused my arm to hyper extend. Bones cracked and my arm broke. I cried out in pain.

“Oh deary, I love the way you scream” it spoke to me with a voice that was broken, full of hateful mirth. It sounded like Ms. Katz was speaking while gargling crumbled bones. Suddenly my biceps flexed, snapping my arm the other way, my limp hand smacking into my shoulder. All I could do was grind my teeth and moan.

With my free arm holding the shovel I swung at the tendrils, severing them. It let out an ear blistering screech, insectoid head thrashing. Enraged, it crouched then lunged for me once more. I was ready this time.

Screaming my throat raw, I swung the shovel and hit it right between its eyes. One instant the shiny black mouth was going to tear my throat out, the next the carapace exploded, green slop flying in all directions. The body went limp and oozed all over me, tendrils seeping out over me onto the ground. The pungent smell of Ms. Katz body, old perfume, and rotting insect meat singed my nostrils. I could barely breath with all of the weight bearing down on me.

My shock wore off and panic set in. I frantically tried to push the corpse off of me, my hands slipping again and again, suffocating instigated desperation deep within me allowing me to drain the last of my strength to finally roll it off myself. Then I lay alone in the silent house.

I started sobbing. I took massive uncontrollable heaves of air into my body and let them out through tears and groans. I could not stop until every last possible emotion had been wailed out of me.

Once I was done, I stood numbly, used the shovel to limp my way out of the house, and packed a bag. I got into my car and rode out at dawn.

After a stop to the local urgent care where I told a true enough story about a bad fall down some stairs, I had a boot for my foot and bandages for my ribs. I drove as far as I could and stopped at a motel.

Three days later I am now writing from my third motel, slowly making my way back home, where I am going to try to forget all of this mess, and start over.

I am not sure what happened to Ms. Katz’s house or the bodies inside, and I don’t care. I needed to tell my story online because no one I know will believe me and because I am not sure if I will live to tell the tale anyways.

Every motel that I have stopped at has the same van that parks in the back of the lot at 3 am when I should be asleep and not notice. A van with a purple flower logo. They leave at 6 am before I should wake up.

I noticed each time because I have not slept since that night. I know I have nightmares waiting for me when I finally crash, but I am not ready to face them yet.

As a kid I was the one always left out in friend groups and picked on by others. Didn’t struggle with anxiety until I was about 12 and changed to a new school like everyone does in Sweden for 7th grade. 

When I was 13 I saw the school counselor, then went to the children’s psych department. I was never taken seriously, never. Got meds that didn’t work when I was 15 and gained weight, the meds didn’t help, got worse since it triggered an eating disorder. It went downhill and I developed a more “serious” self harm ”addiction”. Was inpatient a few times and only then did I get to try a mood stabilizer instead of an anti depressant, and it worked for me. 

I lost so much of my teens being anxious, depressed. I missed out on so much, having a proper social life, enjoying things, going to parties, etc. Didn’t gain my life back until I was 18.  

My new meds made me lose weight, all the weight I gained from my previous meds. Finally started enjoying things like drinking with friends, hanging out with people, feeling comfortable in my body for once, finding my style, getting new friends, getting tattoos and piercings. It seemed to be getting good and I was so hopeful. I stopped self harming and I’ve been clean for 3 years. Though it felt like I knew it wouldn’t last forever. 

After graduating (without a diploma) I started working, first at a coffee shop, then with elderly care. Slowly work was taking a toll on my mental health. First shitty colleagues looking down on me for my age and also for not having an education or anything within healthcare. Then they kept commenting on my weightloss, sure they gave me compliments, but it also made me start having thoughts about losing even more weight. Triggered me into having struggles with food again. We’re short staffed, I have to give meds and insulin, which is stressful in itself. We moved facilities and instead of 8 patients (4 per worker), it increased to 10 (5 per person). That one person adds so much workload, even if it on paper doesn’t sound like it. 

I quit that job. But now I need to find a new one. Or start studying. I have to earn money to pay rent. It sucks. The mental health care system doesn’t give two shits about me. I hate it. Luckily I have good friends and a family who care so much about me. But it’s just not enough. I was promised a doctors appointment to discuss meds but that I haven’t gotten. My lizard died back in June, that sucked, it’s caused me to spiral again. 

All of my friends are dating, except for me. I feel like I’m never enough for anyone. I’ve had multiple talking stages with people but it has never lead anywhere. I’m just sexualized, like so many other women. It feels like I’m only good for sexual things. Not enough to be loved by anyone. I live in a small city, and I’m sort of classified as “emo” here, and most people here are “basic”. They aren’t attracted to “emo” styled people. My friends go on dates and have partners, but that’s because they’re “basic”. I’m just not what people want. 

It just sucks. It’s getting worse again, I’ve started having thoughts about self harming again. I’m starting to have thoughts of dying again. I hate it. I just need someone to talk to. But I can’t even get that.

Before pregnancy, I had a fantastic relationship with my MIL. We got on like a house on fire, and even the other in-laws would joke that I was the favorite out of all the partners. She always made me feel welcome, unlike how she treated one of the other sons-in-law (who I’ve only ever seen be a doting dad).

But when I got pregnant, everything shifted. My family were ecstatic when I told them. The next day we told his family, and his mum’s reaction was… flat. Not even a hug, which was completely out of character. I could tell that it hurt my husband too after seeing the big deal my family made.

As my pregnancy went on, I had severe sickness. I couldn’t keep food down, I was sick all day and night, and mentally it was brutal. Friends and family kept checking in. But from my MIL — nothing. She knew I was unwell, but she didn’t ask once how I was doing. When I sent scans and updates, she’d either ignore them or brush them off with something about what she was doing. After three months of silence, I told my husband I felt disappointed, and he got very defensive, like I was attacking her. The next day, suddenly we had an invite to lunch — which I strongly suspect wasn’t a coincidence.

At that lunch, instead of reconnecting like i hoped, she criticized me the entire time. She mocked me for following pregnancy health guidelines when she saw i wasnt eating runny egg, rolled her eyes about us asking people to be vaccinated for whooping cough, when she asked us if we where doing that, and made comments like “pregnant people these days are scared to break a nail” and “kids need germs.” i but my tongue nog wanting to make a scense, and I just left feeling judged and uncomfortable but didn’t say anything to my partner because of his earlier reaction when i voiced i was disappointed i hadnt heard form her for 3 months.

When we made our birth plan, my husband and I agreed on some boundaries: we’d let family know when we could but not spend labour glued to our phones, if I wanted my mum as a support person, that didn’t mean his mum had to come too, and once baby was born there’d be no kissing and handwashing before holding him. My family accepted this without question. His mum gave a reluctant “fine, we’ll play by your rules.”

Labour itself was traumatic. Our son nearly died, and I ended up with an emergency C-section. During this, my MIL was calling my husband for updates (she didnt know the emergebcy she just knew i was in labor) desire us asking for this not to happen. (This is also her 8th grandchild)

After birth, my mum came to the hospital briefly at the nurse’s suggestion to drop off some colostrum from my freezer and check on me. I held the baby the entire time. Two days later, when my husband had to go home for more things, I asked my sister came to help me shower, get to the bathroom, and pass me the baby, since I still couldn’t walk properly or lift him. Meanwhile, my MIL kept pushing to visit, saying it wasn’t fair that my mum and sister had been there, this time my partner joined in on the ""its not fair"" and I felt just very deflated and like I was the problem"" even though i felt my famiky where just there to help me, not just “visit the baby.”

When we finally went home, his parents were waiting at our house, empty handed. I was barely able to walk, and instead of a peaceful first moment at home, my baby was pulled out of my arms while I had to serve them coffee. My MIL didn’t wash her hands, and despite our very clear boundary, she kissed my newborn. When I reminded her not to, she gave me judgmental looks. He ended up crying and in the end i took him to the nersery to feed him, and they left.

I told my husband it wasn’t fair that I had to enforce rules we had both agreed on, and he promised he’d handle it. But on their next visit, his mum kissed him again. When I pulled him away, she said, “Oh, but I just have to,” tried again, and when I stopped her and pulled my son away her, she snapped “Fine!” and sulked in my living room, ignoring me the rest of the visit.

Since then, this has been the pattern: she dismisses our boundaries, makes digs about me being “overprotective,” and focuses only on the baby while ignoring me. I will walk through the door and be greeted with a ""give me him"". She never asks how I am. After nearly a year of this, I’ve pulled back. I keep her at arm’s length and only see her when necessary.

Now my son is about to start daycare, and my MIL has asked her daughted to message me to let me know thay she wants to pick him up and babysit when I return to work and he should be at daycare. Honestly, the idea makes me feel sick. I don’t trust her to respect our rules or follow basic safety measures when I’m not there. And frankly i dont want her to be allowed to spend time with him whe she has treated me so awfully and out no effort in with me. I’d happily leave him with my parents, because they respect me, checked in on me, and respectour boundires, they never push. But I do not feel comfortable leaving him alone with her. I see my famiky weekly, my mum has watched him already, and because I have pulled back, his family sees our son maybe once a month.

The problem is my husband. He’s wonderful in every other way, but he struggles to set boundaries with his mum. And even if i sugar coat and very politly let him know if something has upset me, i say it so respectfully and not angrily at all, i gst met with ""my family cant do anything right"", ""i feel like you hate my parents"", ""youre ruinging all their visits by telling me all the things they have done wrong"". Whats scary is i have inly voiced like 1% of how i am feeling. I feel i can only keep finding excuses for so long around why she can't have alone time with uim. but if I refuse, and actually tell him the real reason why, ill need to tell him the whole truth, i know ill be saying things that will really hurt his feelings, he’ll see it as me treating his parents unfairly, and it could genuinely be the start of the end of us, as i truly believe he values his relationship with his mum more than me. I worry that finally voicing how I really feel could seriously damage our relationship. If I only tell him half of it like ""she just doesnt respect our boundaries"" it won't be enigh for him he will not understand and will keep pushing.

**Meanwhile, Jordi’s Dismantling House:**

“*Status report on King Fish and Co.?*” Ingrid inquired over the comms.

“We’re at the compound of Jordi’s Dismantling House.” Neith replied, viewing the scenery from the head-mounted tac-cams of Philia’s “Post-Loot Team” or PLT for short. It consisted of the Whales’ \[Item-Box\]-capable mages; Siria, Viel, and Peanut, alongside Kinu and Kvaris whose skills in negotiating a good deal for the Whales were indispensable. Rounding up the small group was Neith via her Aquila drone.

“The others are laying offerings at his statue. You’ve never been here, have you?” Neith said through the speakers only as she silently hovered near the rest of the PLT.

\_\_

**Mink and Roofe’s Canned Goods, Magnor’s Arcade:**

“Only once,” Ingrid said, ducking into the office of Roofe and Minke’s store. She smiled and nodded at Odan Zax, the labrador kobold she had also rescued from the Guileheads along with Kirtus and Selphie. The labrador's tongue was lolling as he cheerfully greeted Ingrid, who couldn't resist and lovingly cuddled the fluffy dog-secretary.

Neith muted the mic as Ingrid and Odan exchanged pleasantries, letting the two briefly catch up.

“How are we doing, Odan?” Ingrid asked, glancing at his books.

“We’ll need more canned food by the week’s end.” The dog said excitedly, gesturing with his paw at the stack of cardboard boxes propped against the wall. “It’s been only three days and we’re seeing more cracked plaster than those card-board boxes.” he laughed.

“I’ll see what we can do…” Ingrid said, scratching behind his ears, “But no promises yet…”

“Of course…” the labrador smiled, making cute canine whining sounds and wagging his tail as she did so. He took a letter and an Honored Note and slid it across the desk. Ingrid's eyes quickly skimmed the letter. It came from a wealthy buyer, having bought some boxes in bulk. Ingrid's eyes twinkled at the amount.

“I'm told you have yet to be familiar with the how Honored Notes work so...” Odan indicated points on the note. “I've taken the liberty of writing your name down, you will need to write it down as well in your own hand and impress on it your seal. In this case, your guild badge will do.”

He proffered a small container of crimson wax and a candle on a fancy stand. “With this you can take it to the Royal Bank and claim the gold.”

“Thank you, Odan!” Ingrid beamed, taking the honored note and wax with her. She then made herself comfortable on one of the armchairs across his desk. Before re-reading her letter, she took out of her Traveler’s Valise a tablet and deployed its collapsible stand so she could monitor the team while she gave the letter a second, more careful reading.

“Glados, get me the PLT's cams.”

“*Acknowledged, Starchaser.*”

The team stood before a grand statue of Jordi in what was likely his prime, depicted in the regalia of a well-dressed and well-armored adventurer. Before the plinth of the statue was a terraced platform with a royal silk carpet draped over it. Perched atop it were a collection of sacred figures of various gods. Flickering on either side of this divine tribunal were votive candles of all shapes and sizes. Some nestled in candelabras, others simply laid on the stone. The flickering lights made it look like the gods were nodding, moving, shifting in the dancing light.

Before this solemn assembly, a grand brazier stood several feet away. It was filled to the brim with sand, raked into decorative patterns. Dotting the surface of this miniature sculpted terrain were the smouldering remains of incense sticks propped planted there by worshipers.

""This is leagues above the one in New Gorpsial\*...\*"" she remarked, taking in the scenery. Odan continued to work on his books, minding his own business. He had seen the “Tee-Vee” and recordings of the Whales as they reviewed their previous adventure that led to the addition of Peanut as well as more mice, and thus knew that Ingrid was coordinating the movements of her team abroad.

As a priest read prayers of honor and praise to the Gods and to Saint Jordi-

“*Jordi’s a saint too, huh?*” Ingrid remarked. Odan ignored her, knowing that she was not addressing him.

“*He is.*” Neith replied, continuing to speak only through everyone’s earpieces while her Aquila drone joined everyone else in prayer.

“*He’s among the saints prayed to by adventures seeking good fortune after a hunt.*” Peanut whispered as she hovered beside Philia.

“*During our previous sabbatical,*” Neith began once again, “*I took the Aquila to register in the library and read about Terragalian History. Jordi the Intrepid was once a notable adventurer, before receiving peerage from the King of Veles. At some point during the tail end of his adventuring days, he started his own dismantling guild in response to the rampant corruption that plagued that institution.*”

Ingrid leaned back on the armchair, propping her legs up on the coffee table. The labrador at the desk smiled, tongue lolling at the surreal sight of a human lounging on a chair like People; like someone who owned the place, which she was.

“This Jordi character, I’m guessing his honest work was what drew him a lot of loyal customers?”

“*It was slow-going at first but yes.*” Neith replied “*More and more adventurers were flocking to the establishment, wisening up to the deceptive schemes the other dismantling houses employed. He went under the radar of these corrupt nobles behind these scams-*”

“What scams specifically?” Ingrid inquired, frowning.

\_\_\_

**Jordi’s Dismantling House, Outer Grounds:**

The gathering of worshippers at the foot of Jordi, Lord of Whirlpeak grew as supplicants held bundles of unlit incense to the chests. Even Neith’s Aquila drone did the same. Nobody batted an eyebrow despite her being the only automata around.

“*Then again,*” Neith thought to herself, “*There’s also Night Men here, I guess seeing a skeleton attend what was basically church services is surreal enough.*”

A few armored figures reverently took off their helmets, revealing bleached skulls and glowing eyes. More than a few young adventurers ooh’ed and began crowding the venerated undead, and Neith, with a growing sense of amusement, saw a few skeletons roll their eyes at the inconsiderate hopefuls trying to pester them for autographs while a holy ceremony was taking place.

“*What scams specifically?*” Ingrid inquired over the comms.

“An arms race for talent and bodies.” Neith replied, keeping her voice only through the radio, so the attending priest’s sung prayer went uninterrupted. “After a large feudal war within Veles, many of the landed aristocraps were looking for ways to build up their private armies once again. They got into the business of paying off dismantling houses to undercut the profits owed to hard-working honest adventurers. They would underpay then social engineer their victims into becoming sworn hired goons of the nobles that paid them off.”

As she spoke and the priest made his hymn, junior acolytes stirred up the sand with shovels so the expended ashes of incense sticks sunk beneath, replaced with a fresh layer dug up from below.

“If you took the unfairly low payment, they would re-sell the spoils at higher prices, which lined the pockets of the corrupt nobility.” Peanut added., “Aside from lining their pockets, it allowed them to buy the loyalty of their tenants as well as hire mercenaries…”

Kinu and Kvaris nodded simultaneously.

“During that time, Freidian dismantling houses saw a surge in adventurers coming from Veles in order to get genuine prices.” Kvaris muttered.

Siria growled quietly in displeasure, “And as a result, some were closing their borders on the Velesian side, trying to prevent travel to Freid. It caused quite a row with the Velesian Court. Thankfully it only lasted a few years and they were forced to let people move as they please.”

“If my history books remind me correctly…” Viel giggled quietly “It started when you blew a fireball right through the blockade.”

Siria blushed as the girls quietly giggled.

“*Ranger-Two, you are a HERO!*” Ingrid said grandly.

“*Boss?*” Odan asked.

“*Oh nothing, I was just saying our cute elf sorceress ended a blockade hundreds of years ago at the Freidian border.”*

“*Oooh!*” Odan exclaimed, sounding a bit like a dog’s howl. “*I know of what you speak about, Si- I mean… our elf is worthy of Sainthood indeed!*”

Meanwhile, the shovel acolytes withdrew and another group carrying rakes got to work expertly forming decorative patterns along the new layer of sand. The priest continued with a litany, which turned into a sort of call-and-response.

“They’re reciting the names of the gods enshrined on that *Hinadan* at the plinth.” Neith explained to Ingrid quietly.

“*I see,*” Ingrid said, “*I’m guessing it’s to sanctify the brazier so the incense offerings become valid?*”

“How’d you know?” Peanut whispered quietly as the crowd responded to the litany mid-chorus.

“*We have Holy Communion in my old world.*” Ingrid replied “*It involves the sanctification of ordinary bread, turning it from something physically filling into one that nourishes the soul. I’m guessing it's the same for the incense.*”

“You’re right.” Viel murmured “Without the blessings, these are just sweet-smelling smoke.”

”*I figured as much.*” Ingrid said, “*So anyway, the jist of what you were saying Glados… so there was once a cabal of corrupt nobles running a scam by paying off dismantling houses to bring adventurers to them…*” Ingrid continued, “*What happened next?*”

“Scam? Those nobles were running a fucking Ponzi scheme.” Philia mumbled fiercely. “Jordi gained peerage through his heroic deeds during a Red Moon and became Arch-Baron. This created a new noble house of his own: Whirlpeak. That allowed his newfound business to flourish now that he had capital, it even let him buy out some of the local dismantling businesses and redistribute some of them back to the aggrieved.”

“*Nice!*” Ingrid beamed “*But I guess the drama starts from there then?*”

“It did,” Neith replied. “With the added big money and influence, the corrupt nobility was starting to see Lord Jordi of House Whirlpeak as a serious threat.” Neith continued as the gathered faithful sang a hymn. Everyone held out their bundles of incense as the priest made his blessings while an acolyte lit them. After he had moved on, the adventurer with the now-lit bundle waved it in a V-shaped pattern five times as was the custom, before gently swinging it up and down thrice, mindful to keep the bundle lit at all times.

“For ten years, while Jordi was seen as a haven for adventurers just trying to make an honest living, the establishment tried hard to smear him before the general public, but his customers grew.” Neith went on, “...and the sheeple lapped it all up, being the sheeple they were.”

Ingrid guffawed “*Like our pro-alien activists, huh?*”

“No different.” Neith said “Who cares if flying saucers zap our cities with death rays? Cities around them can burn, it’s fine if others die, just so long as their idiocy makes them look right. In Terragalia’s case, the serfs could care less if honest, hard-working dungeoneers get chewed up by the machine so long as it makes their lords keep them fat and happy.”

“*So what happened after those ten years?*” Ingrid inquired as the Aquila drone held out its manipulator arms. The priest made his benedictions as the acolyte lit the incense. The drone made the motions while its speakers responded in Neith’s voice, synthesized from the prayers the others before her had uttered.

“The disgruntled adventurers took justice where it belongs; in their hands of the aggrieved.” Peanut squeaked quietly, smiling as she held out her tiny arms so the acolyte could light up her incense bundle. The little mushroom made cute sounds as she waved her smoking bundle.

“As it should be.” Kinu and Kvaris chorused.

“They made Hammurabi proud.” Philia murmured smilingly as she acolyte lit hers next.

“*šumma awīlum awīlam ubbir-ma nērtam elišu iddi-ma lā uktīnšu mubbiršu iddâk.*“ Philia intoned with a wide grin as she waved her incense.

“*Beautiul*.” Ingrid cooed, bowing.

She was quiet for a while, taking in the sight as the PLT placed their incense into the brazier. Each uttered a short prayer, then stepped back and bowed a few times. Through Neith’s cameras she saw that Philia’s party was in some spacious property market grounds that looked more like a section of the city rather than privately-owned ground. The place looked festive, brimming with life, light, and commerce amidst the undertones of losses incurred from the dungeon raids and the encroaching shadows of the night.

There were food stalls all around, no doubt to help weary people refuel before the business of haggling drained them anew. There were also many miniature temples and near them, growing like mushrooms, were stalls selling offerings. Merchants selling sundries related to adventuring also hawked their wares and Ingrid could see some kind of barter system going on, or at least a form of discount as some traded both damaged and broken weapons and armor in exchange for new ones. Not far from these stores a smithy was busy forging new wares from the battered forms of the old.

Strings of streetlamps that looked too oriental in design swung high from cables hidden in the gloom, and further ahead lay a fortress that looked like the Ishtar Gate of Babylon. Long queues of adventurers stretched from it, along with wagons and carts bearing their loot.

“*Blue brick fortress, gold accents, just like the real thing in ancient Iraq although it's got anachronistic gothic banners depicting the coat of arms, and Pazuzu-like gargoyles.*"" Ingrid remarked as Neith craned up one of her oculars at the azure fortress ahead.

“It’s based on Jordi’s distant homeland. Those are his coat-of-arms after gaining peerage from the King of Veles.” Philia added quietly, she looked to the rest of her team and they all nodded before laying them atop the sand-filled censer.

“*Huh,*” Ingrid said, noticing the line of idols on the terraced platform now that the PLT drew close to the brazier, “*Are those gods also…*”

“Yes.” Siria replied without needing Ingrid to finish “Like the ones in the anteroom of the dungeon, these too are not made from Teth-Odin. All of these esteemed idols were crafted from distant homelands, laid down here and cared for all the same. It shows how much esteem adventurers all over give to House Whirlpeak.”

“*Amen to that.*” Ingrid said.

“*S*o, *is this ruse really going to work?*” She inquired as the small group returned to their hand-carts a few feet away. They were like miniature wagons, four-wheeled, with a T-shaped handle/yoke for them to pull. Resting atop each were a quartet of good-sized treasure chests with fake gold inlays. The polished, well-carved wood panels made them look like decorative pieces that would grace one’s living room or parlor, not actual work pieces used to transport goods.

“It’s a trick of the mind, thanks to association.” Siria said quietly as she and Philia led the way, pulling one cart while Kinu and Kvaris handled the other. “You’re in Teth-Odin, you look like adventurers, and you’re heading towards a dismantling house. An observant thief would see we came from the Storm Gate Fortress; just fresh from the dungeon. What else could these fancy chests be but \[Booty Boxes\]?”

Predictably, Ingrid snorted but managed to contain her laughter.

“*But why four of them?*” Ingrid said, “*You said that being seen lugging around a \[Booty Box\] makes you look like you’re incapable of performing the \[Item Box\] spell, but why so many? At this point, aren’t you attracting too much attention?*”

“There’s limits to what a real \[Booty Box\]-” Peanut began before Ingrid once again lost it.

“*PFFT!*” the Starchaser sputtered.

“...can carry.” the little mushroom concluded, smiling as she paced back and forth atop the chests.

“Also,” Philia chimed in, ”because we’re likely to be seen exiting the dungeon’s Gate Fortress, it also stands to reason we should look like we’re loaded, which is why I embellished my old clothes chests with some good old Arts and Crafts to look the part.”

Neith played a cashier’s “Ka-ching!” followed by an over-synthesized “Thank you for shopping at Walmart. Your bill is ten Dollars. That’s worth 0.0030 gold ounces.”

“*I can’t believe I earn MORE being a farm boy here in Terragalia.*” Zefir remarked, joining in on the conversation. “*Gold is really broken.*”

“Yup!” Philia grinned, “Anyway, \[Item Box\] spells can carry more items in them than a \[Booty Box\] can. Something to do with sorcerers being living, breathing, entities that allow them to employ a larger form of quantum storage as opposed to static, enchanted furniture.”

“How much space are we talking about?” Ingrid inquired.

Philia paused to run estimates in her head, “These chests are about four-hundred liters give-or-take, so we’re looking at uhhh…”

“...rule of thumb for a \[Booty Box\] is six times the chest’s space.” Viel reminded her. As she walked between the carts, she had her telekinesis spell on, holding down the chests with a bit of pressure to maintain the illusion that these were heavily-laden containers. Had she not, then the jostling of the carts as they trundled along the cobblestone would have given away the fact that they were ordinary, empty chests.

“Let’s say about 85 cubic feet’s worth of storage.” Philia said, needing only two seconds to do some hasty mental math, “That’s almost the size of an olympic swimming pool. That means one of these boxes alone, if they were real \[Booty Boxes\], could comfortably store that Lifebane Titan.”

“*Cool.*” Ingrid said, digesting the information. “*Should we bother getting real ones?*”

“It’s futile."" Philia sighed, her convoy stopped to let a cheerful party of young adventurers pass, some of them wearing clothes or armor that clearly looked like hand-me-downs. Her eyes flicked over to Siria’s direction, and she saw the elf’s expression briefly break into sadness. Philia knew why; these greenhorns one day and perhaps a day too soon will walk these cobblestones with less of their number if they weren’t too careful.

“Prohibitive costs aside, they're allergic to recursive dimensional storage.” she added, pulling the cart once the path once again lay open for them, “That’s one of the major limits of using static quantum storage, but our \[Item Box\]-users have no problem emptying the goods inside Autumnhollow. If we brought one in, it would brick the box completely.”

“Speaking of which…” Viel meowed, “The fact that Overlord’s dimension was completely unaffected not just inside Autumnhollow but inside the Arcane Pasture just shows how advanced his magic is-”

“*Awww shucks, ma’am! Tweren’t nuthin…*” Cecil drawled in his best cowboy impression. Everyone smiled in the background as they heard the mice squeaking happily as they ate their well-deserved wheels of stuffed cheese.

“*It don’t worry me in the latest, considering how I just flew into Autumnhollow well before I heard about it. Don’t you worry about it too, Starchaser, we got a God’s backing in my dimension anyway.*”

Ingrid was understably quiet, no doubt having an existential crisis in the background.

“*We should really check for anyone trying to bring extradimensional boxes into Autumnhollow anyway…*” she said after a while.

“I think you’d be able to tell.” Kinu and Kvaris chorused. “You’d see someone lugging along a big chest like Philia’s”

“*Phrasing*.” Zefir snickered.

“I have one back in my lodging at the Guildhouse…” Siria mumbled, her eyes scanning the avenue of shops as the small convoy pulled their deceptively light carts over the cobblestone. “I’ve already transferred its contents into Autumnhollow, and yes, I know well enough to be careful when dealing with arcane storage. It’s still there in New Gorpisal.”

“*Anyone else?*” Ingrid asked sheepishly, “*I should’ve asked about this sooner… sorry…*”

“*None of us in that caravan could have afforded anything of the sort.*” Selphie spoke up, in the background everyone could hear the newly acquired fowl honking with the resident geese, “*...also, the matter was already brought up before we were admitted into Autumnhollow. You must have not noticed because you were tending to Kirtus at the time…*”

“If they had…” Viel meowed, “That arcane chest alone would have earned passage for all of them. Kirtus wouldn’t have been hurt. We likely would have never met Suika at all.”

“*Also, Watchtower was with us.*” Selphie added, referring to Nod, “*In hindsight, he had cleverly ascertained the value of our belongings without us reading his intentions. I’m sure that even if someone was being secretive about harboring a Booty Box, he would have discovered it well before we were waylaid.*”

“*That checks…*” Zefir added “*Kirtus told me that Watchtower was trying to hold him back because there was truly nothing super-expensive for the bandits to take. Said he advised him to just let the gang take what they will so nobody got hurt.*”

There was some silence as the Whales thought about their resident fisherman. Once a mole for a gang of bandits, now a functioning member of their team.

“*Please, guys.*” Ingrid spoke up “*If any of you are having reservations about Watchtower, just let me know. So far, he’s been straight with us. Also, I trust King Fish’s judgement regarding his loyalty. He doesn’t want to harm anyone if he can avoid it.*”

“We’re fine with Watchtower.” The Enthana sisters said in sync. This was met with a round of assenting murmurs from the rest of the group.

“*I’ve seen my share of shaky alliances.*” Sammy said, “*He’s proven himself well.*”

“He’s clean.” Philia said finally “buuuut… as for me carrying any Booty Boxes. No, being a king’s bastard daughter and Incitatus meant there were clear limits over what sort of high-class magic items I could take with me. People would be asking too many questions. That said, I do have even more stuff still hidden in Elion-Nosco, but that will take preparation to bring them here…”

“Don’t worry about it too much!” Peanut squeaked, the little mushroom stood atop one of the chests, looking around for any furtive figures trying to sneak closer to them. “There’s been cases where exceptionally powerful \[Booty-boxes\] have been \[Item Boxed\] and were still functioning. These were, of course, extremely expensive ones enchanted by grand-level wizards. What I’m trying to say is… the magic behind Autumnhollow and Overlord’s dimension are greater than that.”

“*I hope so.*” Ingrid sighed.

“Overlord’s dimension and Autumnhollow are probably on the same wavelength of power as the permanent Rifts that exist in this world.” Peanut continued, pacing back and forth like a guard on duty. “A force of Nature itself. If it was so easy to collapse them by throwing a \[Booty Box\] in, then dungeoneering would have ended thousands of years ago.”

“*Thanks for the good news, girls!*” Ingrid said, her voice sounding a little more chipper.

“If it bothers you so much,” Siria remarked, “I can put up a totem that would, as you say, ‘brick’ any \[Booty Box\] coming in. Shouldn’t be too difficult, but there's a catch.”

“*Like how?*” Ingrid asked, “*Do you like, refresh the spell everyday?*”

“Nothing that drastic.” Siria assured her. “Just using some soulstones. The daily upkeep won’t cost them much, but each time someone enters with a bag-”

“*Bag…*” Ingrid said, sounding worried again “… *our Traveler’s Valises are unaffected, why?*”

“See? You’re noticing!” Philia giggled, “It’s not such a big deal, despite what you’re thinking!”

“*Okay, but why?*” Ingrid asked, “*Why does a magic bag pass through our special dimensions no problem but a magic footlocker doesn’t?*”

“The sheer size.” Philia said “Or lack of it. Ballpark estimates say anything reaching the size of a contemporary hiking backpack would be in the get-bricked territory. That’s why they’re all compact in size.”

Again, the convoy stopped as a procession rolled by. This time, actors manipulating a big, shaggy creature ambled into view before breaking into a skillful dance step. A costumed band clanged cymbals and beat drums rhythmically to the shrill melodic tune of horns and bagpipes.

“*Whoa! It’s like the lion dance in China!*” Ingrid exclaimed, sitting up from her chair excitedly.

“Oooh.” Kinu and Kvaris chorused, clapping their hands to the staccato drum beat, “so you have a Tarasque Dance too?”

Viel giggled and clapped excitedly as she beheld the masterful dance moves of the actors under the massive suit. It looked more like a giant was just wearing a tarasque costume rather than a small troupe due to how smooth its movements were.

“It’s the mascot of House Whirlpeak.” Philia told Ingrid. “Apocryphal legends say Jordi and a coalition of other brave warriors took one down after it had emerged from a Riftworld. Same legends also say the fight over the dismantling of such a creature was what kickstarted the smear campaign against him. If legends are to be believed, then it’s what gave him the title of Arch-Baron.”

The tarasque procession had moved on and once again the carts clattered along the street.

“*Arch-Baron?*” Ingrid inquired “*Sounds totally made up.*”

""It is,” Philia said, “The title's totally made-up for convenience purposes. Jordi wasn't of aristocratic stock which would've meant he normally would have to settle for Baron at most, but the King of Veles wasn't going to let that stand considering Jordi's service to the Crown, hence the creation of the rank Arch-Baron to give him precedence above the other barons.""

""*Well, if it works, don’t knock it, I guess.*"" Ingrid remarked, “*I suppose it also had something to do with him now being venerated as a saint, am i right?*”

“It does.” Came Neith’s answer, “As mentioned earlier, he established a completely neutral dismantling house after getting sick of being ripped off by other establishments. Shortly after receiving peerage, he also faced threats of what was the equivalent of de-banking if he kept his honest dismantling houses running. Some tried to buy him out, others tried to get their finger in the pie but Jordi was adamant in keeping everyone out unless they were properly vetted under discriminating eyes. As a result, the landed parasites decided to smear him, call him the anti-christ or Hitler because he was giving adventurers a way to earn good money without having to go through a single bureaucraptic desk.”

“*Ah bureaucracy, it has killed more people than wars and disease combined.*” Ingrid laughed.

“That is a fact.” Kinu and Kvaris snickered in chorus.

“*Good to know he won in the end.*” Ingrid said.

“He didn’t just win, he changed things.” Philia said, motioning for the group to head away from the long queue and towards another gate of the blue fortress ahead, “Sadly, this all took place hundreds of years ago, what I would give to see it unfold. Get this, it made the Defenestrations of Prague look like a G-rated cartoon.”

“*Are you saying it's not?*” Ingrid scoffed.

“It is, it is!” Philia laughed, “Yes that was a lesson that should be taught to children of course! But this piece of Terragalian history is far more viscerally heartwarming, I assure you.”

“*Heartwarming how?*” Ingrid queried, her curiosity piqued.

“Ten years after the establishment of the first Jordi’s Dismantling House,” Philia began, telling the tale with relish, “...disgruntled adventurers, including those who broke ties with the nobility they were socially engineered into taking vows to, banded together and stormed the biggest house behind this scam operation; the Ducal House of Dethalo. In response, the Duke of Dethalo deployed his knights to his aid, and when they failed, they tried getting mobs of sheeple to block passage to the Duke’s estate.”

“*Alright.*” Ingrid said “*How’d they deal with those numbnuts?*”

“The adventurers didn’t mess around.” Neith related “They hacked, chopped, and blasted away.”

Kinu, Kvaris, and Siria were having a giggling fit. “We have nursery rhymes for it too!”

“These adventurers were having none of it. That said, they mostly just bludgeoned and beat the sheeple into submission to bash a path straight forward.”

“*I love those heroes already.*” Ingrid chuckled. “*Statues should have been built in their honor!*”

“They have.” Philia said. “Those sheeple were complicit after all. It’s never okay for honest, hard-working dungeoneers to sacrifice themselves for the selfish benefit of sheeple who love to suck the gaslighting straight out of their lord’s butt hole.”

“*Ewww…*” Ingrid snorted “*What, you mean those power-seeking nobles were using the profits these honest adventurers made from their own blood, sweat, and tears into food stamps and government cheese for their unwashed smelly peasants?*”

“*Less the pocket-liner, yes.*” Neith replied quickly. The convoy stopped as they waited for another group of big trolls to cart over a veritable train of money in the form of monster carcasses. As the big sturdy carts rolled by, it jostled the draped-over limbs, making it look like the monsters were making a last-ditch effort to grab some unwitting passerby.

“The dumb and ignorant were being fattened up and turned loyal at the expense of the cool people. That makes them fair game.” Philia continued for Neith, “Anyway… back to the history lesson. The historians noted that these vengeful heroes didn’t kill that many non-people. They had a better fate in store for them, a slap to the face. When all was said and done the heroes rounded up all the sheeple and one-by-one threw them out the window of one the higher floors of the mansion-”

“*EINS! ZWEI! DREI!*” Philia laughed as she mimed holding someone’s legs while her imaginary partner held the arms, swinging the imaginary victim back and forth twice before flinging them away.

“*FLIEGEN!*” Ingrid and Philia chorused.

“Mach’s gut, Trottel!” Neith giggled, playing a soundclip of the Wilhelm scream. The troll train was beginning to taper off but Philia motioned for the convoy to pull aside, close to one of the food stalls that caught Viel’s fancy.

“*Hold it, why count off in German?*” Zefir inquired. “*Isn’t Prague Czech?*”

“Talk about good timing,” Philia chuckled. “We just pulled up to a stall serving isekai Döner kebab.”

1mymjps,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1mymjps/aio_for_breaking_up_with_my_girlfriend/,AIO for breaking up with my girlfriend?,"I was dating a girl who’d cancel plans last minute, say I didn’t love her, and tell me I’d get tired of her soon. She’d push me away, tell me to find someone else and then complain I didn’t come see her. When I said I would, suddenly her room was “too messy.”

Every time I opened up, she'd say: “If you don’t like it, I’ll just leave.”

She kept making jealousy games, saying people asked if she was single. Then she blocked me on WhatsApp and sent me a text saying she missed me. Her mom even called asking if I loved her.(After the end)

Later, my ex called inviting me to her mom’s birthday. Then said she missed me more than she thought she would… and asked if I wanted to come over. I said no  and she told me I abandoned her, that I chose this. Said I took her happiness away and she just wanted it back.

She wouldn’t let me Take pictures of us about us, meet her family, or even arrive early when we had plans. Every time I opened up emotionally, she disappeared. At one point she even suggested I should use dating apps, then I found her on those exact apps after we broke up.

Once, she said she wasn’t going to a party  so I said I’d go to church. Out of nowhere, she went to the party and pushed me to go to church instead. When I offered to show up early to spend time before the event, she refused. I still bought chocolate, waited outside… her sister saw me and brought me in. She introduced me to her friends as her boyfriend. Later that night, she randomly said: “Should we download an app and find you a hot girl?”


One day, after I was robbed and nearly lost her contact, she didn’t even check on me. Just said: “I won’t text you unless you text me first.”

Eventually, we went to the movies after a long back and forth. She said she was too shy, then that we should “just be friends.” But we went, held hands, kissed, had a sweet day. Still, she never let me near her phone, and only gave me her Instagram after we broke up.

She didn’t want me close to her family. Another time, I said we never went out because she kept flaking  she got mad. Once, she gave me chocolate and we cuddled… then talked about breaking up minutes later.(A matter of hours)

So many moments like this. Constant confusion, mixed signals, hot and cold behavior.

Eventually, I called her and ended things. She cried, blocked me, and said I “sent her to a mental clinic.” Then messaged me saying she missed me more than she expected. We talked again, but I found her on a dating app. When I asked why, she said she was “looking for her friend’s ex.” I said I loved her  and she said she went somewhere and wished I had gone with her.

She called again, invited me to her mom’s birthday  I didn’t go. Then her mom called me asking if I loved her. Later, invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again. She said her dad was mad at me, which made me spiral emotionally. I vented online. She saw it and told me I used her, that she was insecure. Said she prayed for me every day then blocked me and vanished.

To this day… I don’t know what I did so wrong. My feelings for her were real.",0,1756010777.0,AmIOverreacting,3,0.5,False

My friends aren't abusive, but I felt myself slipping away and not enjoying their company any more, after not speaking to them for months I've recently got back on social media and communicated with them again. 

While at the beginning I felt refreshed and ready to rejoin them, just a week into being in contact with them I find myself wanting to find distance again. The combination of their lifestyle and careers are all similar, drinking, smoking/vaping, gambling, are all things I distance myself from greatly now and I'm a lot stronger because of it. Add on to the fact that it can be a very toxic and bitchy friend group at times, and it feels like nobody actually liked anybody else.

Arnfried who is currently fidgeting with his hands, asks nervously as he glances down at the table. He stutters as he rambles on, an anxious habit of his.

“So, uh, I like this girl. Her um, name is Kai. And I want to learn how to ask her, her out, without embarrassing myself. Or be called a creep. Well I’m not, uh, a creep though. Crap. I’m probably embarrassing myself now. I should, I should stop talking now.”

Last time we released the third seal and got some coffee. On the last post I asked for your thoughts on whether it’s a good time to fight the Sword Dancer or not, and the general consensus is that I can go for it now but I still have some time. I decided I’ll tackle it in a bit, before doing the Tower of Mana, at u/RockSauron ‘s recommendation.

Our next destination is Luin’s church so we can ask how to get into the Tower of Mana, which I believe is the location of the next seal. We don’t know how many seals there are in total, but I have a hunch that this is the last one since we got fire (Efreet), water (Undine) and wind (Sylph), so the last one should be earth (Gnome), at least in this world. Unless there’s another universal seal for Maxwell or something.

We head straight for Luin and right before entering we get a skit where Lloyd laments Colette’s situation and wonders if there isn’t another way to save the world that doesn’t involve Colette having to suffer. Kratos had alluded to something similar earlier, when he said the journey of regeneration didn’t make sense and urged Lloyd to think of a better way.

We finally enter Luin and… what the actual fuck?? The city is in Luins! I mean ruins! What happened here? I was just gone for a minute! I really can’t leave you guys alone, what a mess. I have a strong hunch that the nearby Desian human farm has something to do with this situation. I’m glad I came to Luin before it was destroyed, thanks u/yuki_onoko for the recommendation!

The city’s slogan subtitle thingy changed from “the city of hope” to “the city of devastation.” You got that right. They didn’t spare anyone or anything, there’s literally nothing left. If this was the Desians’ work, they must have used some sort of large-scale weapon like a bomb or something. I wonder what prompted them to do this, the other places we’ve visited that have been attacked by Desians were not left completely devastated like Luin.

On the next screen over we find our super best friend Sheena. Lloyd is surprised she’s badly wounded. Ummm didn’t we JUST kick her ass? It should be no surprise she’s on the verge of death! Colette naively asks Raine to heal her but Raine, being cautious, wants to know what happened first. Sheena confirms it was the damn Desians that caused this destruction. Apparently the people of Luin were hiding some escapees from the nearby ranch and that prompted the Desians to level the entire city. At least they took the surviving citizens prisoner, so as far as we know they’re alive and relatively well at the ranch.

We ask Sheena how she got injured exactly and she tried to avoid the subject, but before we can pry further we’re suddenly interrupted by a priest asking for help. He’s being attacked by one of those Exsphere human monsters, who turns out to be Clara, Dorr’s wife! Apparently she made her way here all the way from Palmacosta. Sheena tries to attack Clara but gets immediately owned due to her injuries. Colette flies in and tries to calm Clara down, but the monsterized human attacks her and she stumbles to the floor. At the same instant, Clara seems to disappear. I’m not sure if this was due to the limitations of the era or if she was actually supposed to be disintegrated/teleported the instant she attacked the Chosen, but the bottom line is she’s not there anymore.

Sheena’s on the verge of dying, having lost too much blood, so everyone implores Raine to heal her. She finally gives in and heals Sheena back to normal. She’s thankful and swears to repay her debt to us. She then leaves despite Colette wanting her to stay. We then talk to the priest that Sheena saved, and he mentions that the monster stole the key to the Tower of Mana. Figures. 

We have 2 objectives now: find Clara and get the key to the tower, and rescue the Luin citizens from the Desian ranch. I’m going to do the ranch first since I have no idea where or how to find Clara, but first I have some unfinished business with a certain sword-dancing demon.

I exit the city on the western side and start to head back to the Ossa Trail. Unfortunately long-range mode doesn’t work here, I guess I need to find another monument around here. On the plus side, while looking for the monument I found a technical ring and a skit. I never did find the monument though. After a long long trek, I finally get back to the Ossa Trail. I immediately heal up and head inside the cave/mine/maintenance tunnel to confront my old nemesis.

It was definitely the hardest fight so far, but it still wasn’t too bad. I used Lloyd, Kratos, Colette and Raine. Lloyd’s job was tanking, mostly defending against the sword attacks and getting the occasional attack in. Kratos was on healing duty, keeping Lloyd alive. Raine was casting Photon and occasionally helping with the healing, and Colette was trying to steal non-stop, on u/grephantom ’s recommendation. I defeated him without being successful at stealing the item, so I reset and tried again. I beat him again and still no steal so I just gave up on it. Hopefully it wasn’t a must-have item. For my troubles, I got a Yata Mirror. I looked up what it does and apparently it gives you a small HP and TP regen effect during battle. Nice.

Aaaand that’s it for today folks. It was a busy day so I wasn’t able to make as much progress as I would’ve liked. Tomorrow we’ll go back to Luin and set off for the nearby human ranch to rescue the Luiners and kick some Desian ass. Thanks for reading!",6,1756010334.0,tales,6,0.87,False

1mymdug,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1mymdug/the_devil_wears_scrubs_by_freida_mcfadden/,The Devil Wears Scrubs By Freida McFadden,"Hey everyone! I just finished a book that really got its hooks into me, and I couldn't wait to share my thoughts with you all. It's Freida McFadden's [The Devil Wears Scrubs By Freida McFadden](https://pdfhive.com/the-devil-wears-scrubs-by-freida-mcfadden/), and if you're a fan of medical thrillers with a good dose of suspense, you might want to pay attention.

**A Quick Peek (No Spoilers, Promise!)**

So, imagine starting your dream job as a doctor, fresh out of medical school, but quickly realizing that the hospital isn't quite the welcoming place you imagined. Instead, you find yourself under the thumb of a senior resident who seems to have it out for you, making your life a living nightmare. This book plunges you into the intense, high-stakes world of a hospital, where the stakes aren't just about medicine, but about survival and sanity. It's a gripping tale of power, manipulation, and the fight to prove yourself in an environment that feels like it's actively trying to break you.

**What Really Stood Out For Me**

First off, the pacing of this book is incredible. From the first page, Freida McFadden pulls you in and doesn't let go. It's a quick read, which I always appreciate when I'm looking for something to devour in a couple of sittings. The chapters are short, often ending on a cliffhanger, making it super hard to put down. I found myself saying, ""Just one more chapter!"" way past my bedtime.

The characters, especially the protagonist, felt very real to me. You really root for her as she navigates the challenges thrown her way. The antagonist is truly chilling – you'll find yourself frustrated and angry on behalf of the main character, which is a sign of a well-written villain! The setting of the hospital also added so much to the atmosphere; it felt authentic and claustrophobic in the best possible way, enhancing the feeling of being trapped.

**A Couple of Thoughts**

While I absolutely enjoyed the ride, there were a couple of moments where the sheer number of unfortunate events piling up on the protagonist felt almost overwhelming, even a tiny bit repetitive. It sometimes pushed the boundaries of belief just a smidgen, making me wonder how one person could possibly endure so much. However, this didn't detract too much from the overall enjoyment, as the plot twists and turns kept me guessing. It's more of a fun, thrilling escape than a deep, contemplative read, and it excels at that.

**Would I Recommend It? Absolutely!**

If you're looking for a fast-paced, engaging thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat, then yes, give this one a go. It's perfect for fans of medical dramas, psychological suspense, and anyone who enjoys stories where an underdog fights against a formidable foe. If you've enjoyed other books by Freida McFadden, you'll likely love this one too! If this sounds like your kind of ride, you can check out [The Devil Wears Scrubs By Freida McFadden](https://pdfhive.com/the-devil-wears-scrubs-by-freida-mcfadden/) and dive in!

**For New Readers: Your Reading Journey Starts Here!**

If you're just getting into reading or trying out new genres, especially thrillers, here are a few friendly tips:

1.  **Start Small:** Don't feel pressured to read a huge, complicated book first. Short, fast-paced novels like this one are a great way to build momentum.
2.  **It's Okay to Stop:** If a book isn't grabbing you, it's perfectly fine to put it down. Reading should be enjoyable, not a chore. There are countless books out there!
3.  **Find Your Niche:** Experiment with different genres. You might discover you love fantasy, historical fiction, or even romance. The more you read, the more you'll understand what truly excites you.
4.  **Set Aside Time:** Even 15-20 minutes a day can make a big difference. Make it a routine – maybe before bed, during your commute, or with your morning coffee.
5.  **Don't Be Afraid to Dive In:** The best way to become a reader is just to start reading! And if you're looking for where to start your own reading adventure, maybe even with something like [The Devil Wears Scrubs By Freida McFadden](https://pdfhive.com/the-devil-wears-scrubs-by-freida-mcfadden/) itself, remember that every page is an opportunity to discover something new.

I'm a web developer here in town and for a personal portfolio project, I'm looking for a few local businesses to help out. I've seen some amazing places that don't have an online presence beyond social media, and I'd love to help change that.

I'm offering to build a clean, modern, and highly functional website for three businesses, completely free of charge. I'm not looking to sell anything. The goal is to build my portfolio with some good, local examples and do something positive for our community.

As part of the project, I’ll also provide a simple guide and walk you through everything you need to know to manage it yourself. I want to make sure you're set up for success from day one.

If you own a small business and this sounds like something that would help you, or you know a place that could use it, please send me a DM with a bit about your business and we can grab a coffee sometime and talk about it.

I'm really looking forward to a meeting some cool people and helping out some great businesses!

First… When Bill got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at the start of the third book, I recalled that in the first book he mentioned not wanting to drink coffee after a certain time of day because it would give him an acid stomach (or something similar). I wonder if King had already planned Bill’s end and put that in as an early hint. 

Second… maybe this will be revealed in a later book but… the boy who saved Barbara in Low Town… could this be the same boy Hodges helped with the happy slapper who he then charged with the task of doing a good deed in the future?

I had a bean-to-cup Delonghi machine until last week. It was convenient but the coffees made didn't have much taste. I think the coffee was flowing too quickly, because the grinding was not fine enough or the coffee not well compressed.

I bought this week an espresso maker, and started with ground coffee (illy from an aluminium can). Getting much better results already.

For using beans, I can see some manual grinders costing $15, some fairly well rated electric one on Amazon for $80, and some others costing $400.

What's really the difference? Are most machines (below a certain price) not using the very same burr grinder inside? Am I really going to be able to tell the difference in taste, unless I buy top quality fresh beans too?",1,1756010082.0,espresso,3,0.67,False
1mymbgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/OveractiveBladder/comments/1mymbgl/i_dont_know_what_to_do/,I don't know what to do,"For some context I'm 21f was a bedwetter up until at least 9 but I'm pretty surr it was later than that. Due to trauma I have extreme anxiety when it comes to others and myself needing to pee, to the point where it's bled into my OCD. 

For the most part everything was fine. From about 10-14 years old there were no leaks or outright wetting incidents. From my memory there were two incidents when I was 15 and one where I was 16 but in all fairness it was kind of my fault for not going but at the same time my school wasn't clean and I was petrified to use the toilets. 

Fast forward to 18 I started to have tiny leaks at night. Barely-there patch on even my underwear let alone the bed and now I'm 21 and sometimes have multiple accidents primarily at night. Sometimes there's some leakage during the day (very small amount) but it's mainly at night. Sometimes I'm dry for days or weeks and then it comes back in full force and I still live at home with 4 other people, 2 of which are constantly home and it makes washing soiled sheets hard to coordinate with their comings and goings. Alongside my previously mentioned severe anxiety surrounding this topic I'm pretty beaides myself with what to do.

At the beginning of the year I saw a physio for leg/back pain and of course they ask about bladder and bowel movements and sexual function. I didn't know this at the time and a family member came with me and the questions caught me so off-guard that I said everything was fine (it's bad, I know, but I don't feel comfortable being honest in front of this person). It's not. I'm pretty sure I have some form of lasting back injury due to a riding accident when I was 12 that goes beyond a tilted pelvis and other things (I didn't know anything was wrong so I didn't see a chiropractor for a year and by the time I did two of my vertebrae were fused near the bottom of my spine) and I don't know if that's affected me in any way? 

I had a rather bad UTI before the afformentioned incident when I was 16, and another early last year but by then I was already having accidents at night regularly. 

I'm just pretty stumped with what to do. I know I need to speak to someone but even writing this I'm shaking-this is a really tough topic for me so I'm hoping for some at-home advice? 

I alreadg cut back from caffeine (1 coffee a day, none beyond 12pm) and I rarely drink alcohol because it triggers restless legs that was previously bought on by medication I still have to take. I have a waterproof cover but I think I need 2 to alternate for washing but money is also a problem and of course the smell. On the off-chance I wake up before a full wet I can't make it to the toilet because of my room layout (I have to spread my legs to squeeze past my loft bed and desk-I have a VERY small room) and any towels or clothes on hand are on mop-up duty. 

And for some more context on how bad this anxiety is-I have severe period cramps and to get an ultrasound I have to have a full bladder which I absolutely cannot do due to this anxiety. I broke down at the doctor's when they suggested it I was so embarrassed.

I definitely have some mild nerve damage from my accident at 12 (waist down, mostly left side) so I think that may have something to do with it? 

Sorry another thing, how full does your bladder have to be for you to feel the urge? I know that's roughly 50% capacity, but I want real people answers and not what the NHS says, just in case. I think my accident affected my nerves surrounding my bladder and ureatha? Is that how this works? I'm not sure. 

I'm sorry this is long, but I'd appreciate any advice. This is quite literally ruining my confidence and mental health and I don't know who to turn to. Thank you for reading.",1,1756010012.0,OveractiveBladder,0,0.99,False

I cannot hold these incidents inside of my mind any longer. 

(Second Part Is where she tries to pull back the shower curtain on her teenage son)



I am the oldest of three boys, I have an older sister. 

Sister is 3 years older, brothers 5 and 8 years younger.

My mother would not call my sister by name but only by "".. you little b%tch."" Never jokinly.

I overheard my mother chewing my sister out for throwing a woman product away in the trash. She shamed her stating if my brothers were to see that they would be in shock thinking someone was bleeding to death. 

My heart ached for her but I couldn't move or I'd be heard. and punished. for being within earshot. 

They went thru the garbage each and every day.

They went out to the cans by the garage and went thru any new bags we had thrown out while they were not at home as well. 

It was common to throw something away only to have them bring it back and covered in whatever else rolled around in the bag.

Scream that you should have asked them before deciding that was to be tossed. He would say

""Yes, I would have told you to throw it out... BUT YOU DIDN'T EVEN F#%KING WAIT TO ASK ME!!"". This was at 10p.

I had tossed the used coffee grinds, put in a fresh filter, fresh scoops, set the timer for him earlier that evening at 8:30p.

My mother and father refused to let my sister cut her hair so that they could grab her with it and proceed to abuse her. Both parents would parade her around the neighborhood and gush to strangers how ""beautiful and long her pretty hair was"". 

She would smile and politely thank people if a compliment was given, but the sadness that befell her face because she knew they would pull it later was always heart wrenching. 

My sister had to adapt wearing her hair tied in a bun the majority of her life to keep herself safe from the hands of my parents trying to pull her hair from her head. 

  
My father would come into the bathroom daily after I had styled my own hair and thrust his fingers thru my hair, pull it, scratch my scalp- only after he watched me and saw that I had finished and styled it how I liked. (He was also a firm believer this should be done directly as I was walking into church every Sunday morning as well.)

Any moment in the bathroom my father would find storm it and chest bump me against the sink. While brushing my teeth, combing my hair, flossing, any reason. 

He felt the need to try and press me against the mirror and scream how worthless and weak I was compared to him. (Once I shot to 6'4 at 14 this stopped thankfully)

Both parents made the upstairs bathroom a war zone in our home. 

Neither of my parents would shut the door while using the facilities, and would come and OPEN the door on you when you closed and used it yourself.

I got spanked with a belt many many times for closing and locking the bathroom door to go to the bathroom. 

Mom and Dad would follow me when I headed to the bathroom and once I closed the door the handle would immediately jiggle and if it was locked....... 

Door pounding and screaming ensues.

""WHY IS THIS DOOR LOCKED!!!! YOU DON'T LOCK DOORS FROM ME!!""- if the attacker is mom.

""WHY IS THIS DOOR LOCKED!!!! YOU DON'T LOCK DOORS FROM US!!""- if the attacker is dad.

I""ve been demanded to open the bathroom door, pulled off the toilet, spanked with a belt, then called disgusting because I was..... indisposed. 

""WHAT ARE YOU HIDING IN HERE!!!!"" he'd say, trying to validate his intrusion. 

He'd swear to my mom after beating me that I was hiding something, he JUST knew it. 

""Mike, you're leaving MARKS! What did he really do??"" she'd ask.

Dad would stand and validate his tantrum. 

""He's BEING a REBELLIOUS TEENAGER!!!!!"", he pants, scoffs,and jumps up and down landing with a stomp twice. 

He's been holding onto my arm so hard that my hand and wrist is turning color.

""MIKE, his ARM is turning color. Let go."" She's not concerned for my well being, they are both paranoid that a teacher or friend will see the marks or worse-

I'd run away.

She yelled at me for using the bathroom when she needed it everytime I showered until 14.

At 14 she wouldn't stop coming into the  bathroom when I would shower. 

For. Any. Make Believe.Reason.

I was not allowed privacy in that home. If something was ""Private"" it was a secret, and we can't have secrets from mom and dad. 

I would go around the house and announce I was to shower, if anyone needed anything speak now or wait 20 mins. I found each member to tell them, I could have snapped my fingers in front of her eyes and she wouldn't have blinked.

She REFUSED to acknowledge even my presents when I would say this. 

I would head to the bathroom, close both access doors, lock.

Water starts, adjust the temp. Have to stand there in a towel because...

BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM

""WHY IS THIS DOOR LOCKED IN MY HOUSE!!!!""

""Mom, I'm about to shower. I told you that.""

She whispers.... ""... I didn't hear you.""

Ignore and check the water temp.

""WHAT??"" she screams thru the door.

""Huh?""

""I SAID I DIDN'T HEAR YOU! OPEN THIS DOOR.. I NEED IN THERE FOR SOMETHING!""

""Mom, what? I'll hand it to you.""

""NO!!! I""LL GET IT MYSELF!!""

She would want to come into the bathroom to stand and glare at me instead of reaching what she ""needed"".

""You DON'T lock doors in my house. I don't care when you're taking a shower, if I NEED in MY bathroom I can walk into MY bathroom. I don't answer to you, I'm not on YOUR schedule!""

As a young man coming of age I made the mistake of acknowledging my body in what I thought would be a private moment and had the door opened on me to her intrusion shortly after this. 

The final strike was terrifying. 

I stood in the shower, the door opens, the cold air rushes in. 

Mom mutters something quietly. Then asks

""What?"" for a response. 

She asks me if I've seen the washcloths that are supposed to be on the shelf outside the bathroom. I had. Before getting in the shower. ON the shelf, where they all belonged.

This woman tried to gently pull back the shower curtain and the liner. 

I had grabbed it prematurely instinctively. 

""YOU DON'T PULL THAT OPEN!!"" I shut her out, I keep her out. 

""WELL, I CAN'T HEAR YOU WITH IT CLOSED!!""

""WHAT?"" I yell..... baiting her in my anger.

""I SAID I CAN'T HEAR YOU WITH THAT CLOSED!""

""You heard that JUST fine.""

Shower curtain still closed, She asks ""WHAT??"" twice before growling and storming out in defeat.  

I worked at the R.E. Lindner YMCA across from Norwood High School on Sherman Avenue in Norwood as a Lifeguard. I started showering at work afer school and after my shifts each day. There was 30 mins between when the pool closed and when the building closed. I usually had the showers to myself.

My beloved has beaten lymphoma after months of chemo. We're celebrating by taking our first-ever cruise. We want to spend a little time in a civilised country.  
  
On Oct. 6, we are set to be in Sydney, N.S. between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. The Cabot Trail excursion for which we signed up has been cancelled for some reason. It's clear from what we read that even the ship's day-trip would have only sampled a little of what sounds like a lovely drive. We would like to take in as much of the area's beauty as we can.

Any suggestions on local providers from whom we can book a brief tour?

\+++++

Entirely separate query: In 2014, I spoke in Halifax about a book I had written long ago, recently published in a new edition: https://www.ttupress.org/9781682832714/karski/. A youngish academic from Sydney, I presume from CBU, attended and invited me to speak on campus. I really wanted to oblige him, but my day-job then did not afford enough vacation time for the multi-leg flight to Sydney. I have since lost all track of his identity and contacts.  
  
I'm retired now. I don't fancy that I can speak on campus in the limited time I'll be in Sydney. But if I can connect with that professor--should he still be in Sydney--I'd enjoy sharing coffee or tea with him and giving him a copy of the seventh edition, published after Oscar nominee David Strathairn portrayed the subject of the biography in a film aired in the U.S. on PBS. I would welcome any contact suggestions.

Thanks,

I’m a 33-year-old married Indian man from Vancouver, Canada. Life's been busy lately, and I'm looking to relax and unwind with some good conversation. I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

Thanks!",1,1756009621.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

After filtering out the coffee grounds, I poured myself a cup—it tasted fine. I stored the rest in a pitcher in the fridge. About a day later (\~27 hours, to be exact), I had a second cup and noticed it tasted noticeably better.

It’s not just me: other post have also mentioned this too \[[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/coldbrew/comments/19d46pe/how_does_cold_brew_flavor_improve_over_time_in/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/coldbrew/comments/q1vobd/does_cold_brew_tastes_better_over_time/)\].

Its currently 5:14am and I dont rlly even feel tierd. Idk why but its getting worse. I cant manage with doing all nighters but I dont like waking up at like 2pm and not being able to do anything through out the day cos i dont have any time. I cant even do an all nighter and have nap throughout the day cos if I do I just wont sleep later. I try drinking coffee but it just doesn't seem to affect me. I had a really strong latte after an all nighter last week and it did nothing. I didnt feel more awake or energised, If anything I felt more tired. The problem I have is that I could try and go to sleep now by forcing myself to keep my eyes closed till I fall asleep but I know for a fact I wont wake up before 1:30pm or 2pm and wont get tierdish again till like 5am, or I could do an all nighter and go to sleep at a much earlier time in hopes of resetting my sleep schedule. But this lack of sleep issue is getting progressively worse. Idk maybe im subconsciously stressing out cos I have my last year of high school coming up in abt a week and a half but I cant manage with this. I need anyone to pls give me advice and help so I can fix this and actually get to sleep at a reasonable hour and wake up at a reasonable hour so I can actually do things throughout the day. It's now 5:25am and im rlly struggling with what to do. Pls any help is appreciated ",1,1756009558.0,ADHD,5,1.0,False

His birthday is in a month , and this is his last birthday with me until he gets shipped off to the military in December. 
I would love some help coming up with ideas of what to do for him. 
He’s a fun-gift kinda guy, not so much into practical stuff, unlike me, so i’m sorta clueless. 
He loves Dragon Ball, anime, and he’s super into religion, religious buildings (cathedrals and such), and just different cultures in general.  He’s interested in learning about other people and their backgrounds. He loves contemporary and fine arts. He also loves just local coffee shops that are good at making a pure black cup of coffee (not sure what the requirements are for that). 
I don’t really what’s around here in Denver that he would love to do before he leaves. We’ve gone to the aquarium and elitches multiple times. He doesn’t love those places, but doesn’t hate them either. Just wouldn’t do spend that money again. 
Any and all help would be really appreciated. Thank you so much !! ",0,1756009186.0,Denver,1,0.44,False
1mym1ld,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mym1ld/know_thyself/,Know thyself,"Since many posts can be addressed with the same concept, I wanted to delve a bit deeper into it. Many forces draw our attention outwards, including relatively recent notions of romantic love (that some claim has replaced religion as a central tenet of meaning in our lives, which leads to disastrous consequences).

One problem with constant distraction is that our authentic voice is subtle. It needs silence to express itself. That loud voice in your head, the intense one telling you to get up and grind, is an expression of narcissistic tendencies. It is the side that feels the need to perform to receive validation.

Narcissism is a natural phase of human development and a helpful adaptation when it remains subclinical, but it is no path to a meaningful life. It is the exact opposite, in fact. But again, there are many cultural incentives to adopt a narcissistic personality, even if you are not pathological.

You need to enforce ""quiet"" in your lives. Even (especially) if you are in a relationship or a close living situation. When you do that and spend time in solitude (solitude is a choice - loneliness feels imposed), you will get to know yourself.

Allow that self-knowledge to inform a mission. Something you could imagine dying for.

On a lower level, find a purpose in life. Something that you enjoy doing so that you spend the time needed to gain mastery. Prioritize in-person relationships - while it's nice to share things online, it can't replace the intimacy of in-person connections.

A one-minute conversation with the person who serves you coffee has more emotional value than spending hours online. Doing absolutely nothing, for that matter, has more positive emotional value than getting Insta/fb/Twitter/Reddit, etc.

So do a lot of nothing at first, it is ok. If you don't know where you are going, you're essentially lost at a rapid pace.

It's a long road, but ultimately worth it. Money, relationships, status, novelty, and agency are consequences of self-knowledge, and they are far from the most valuable ones.

By the way, I am not suggesting that we live in some sort of meritocracy - being born rich is the best way to become rich, but the rest of us need to fight, tooth and claw - really just to get by, let alone thrive.

Best of luck - I'm here if you ever want to talk.",1,1756009073.0,Advice,0,0.67,False
