Hey Leute,  
vor einem Monat habe ich euch meinen Traum vorgestellt: TropiCoffee, fruchtige Kaffeebohnen ohne Sirup, ohne Zucker, aber mit vollem Aroma.  
Jetzt, 1 Monat sp√§ter, ein kleines Update & ein paar Fragen an euch!

**Was bisher geschah**:

* Die Website wurde stark √ºberarbeitet
* Erste Bestellungen sind reingekommen 
* Das Feedback ist √ºberw√§ltigend! Ich habe schon viele Bewertungen erhalten (von ‚Äûendlich mal was Neues‚Äú bis ‚Äû√ºberraschend lecker‚Äú). 
* Einige trinken es kalt wie Eistee, andere hei√ü wie Cappuccino ‚Äì genau wie geplant 

**Was jetzt ansteht**  
Ich will noch gezielter werden.

**Welche Zielgruppe passt am besten zu TropiCoffee?**

* Menschen, die keinen klassischen Kaffee m√∂gen? 
* Kreative? Junge Leute? Fitness-Community? 
* Wer liebt fruchtige, verspielte Sorten im Alltag?

**Neue Produktidee ‚Äì was denkt ihr?**  
Ich √ºberlege, **nachhaltige Kapseln + passendes Pulver** anzubieten.  
Die Idee: Kapseln sind wiederverwendbar, Kunden f√ºllen sie selbst mit unserem fruchtigen TropiCoffee-Pulver.  
Klingt das spannend? Oder zu kompliziert?

Ich bin super dankbar f√ºr jede ehrliche Meinung ‚Äì ihr habt mir schon beim Start so geholfen. üôè

1lyp8te,https://www.reddit.com/r/aquarius/comments/1lyp8te/broke_up_with_my_cancer_bf_35m_aquarius_28f_he/,"Broke up with my cancer bf (35M), aquarius (28F). He was the best emotionally, but not for me","I met this guy through a dating site five months ago. Can't say we are simply dating, we're in a serious full fledged relationship minus living together. He is almost my fiance (as per our culture) cause it was agreed at our families.

I've been single for almost three years and never had a serious relationship before. He had been single atleast 7 years. We both were looking for marriage and serious relationship. 

Everything started out great. I counted myself lucky for finding somebody who is head over heels for me. All the love, attention, caring were new to me cause I never experienced this before. He was also over the moon with how much I loved and cherished him. He never made me feel doubt about his love for me, always validated and put me on a pedestal. 

Thought out the day he kept messaging or calling just to stay close. He‚Äôs a calm, shy, soft-spoken guy and has this gentle quietness about him. Extremely introverted person.
Physically and sexually, we‚Äôre incredibly compatible. The chemistry is intense, and he‚Äôs always been attentive to my needs. 

We shared the same kind of love for movies, music, and pop culture. That helped us bond and made conversations easier in the beginning.

Above all, we loved each other very deeply. He is always my first serious relationship and I really imagined having a family, having kids, buying house and all with him. We told family (I didn't wanna tell this early, but done out of pressure) and my family already visited his family decided to get married around the end of this year.

It was difficult to understand him and first and then I learned he is a cancer, I could read him inside out, that what I thought. I am an independent, aquarius who wants my alone time every single day, happy to do small things by myself, not to bother anyone for anything. While he craved my uninterrupted attention and emotional connection all the time.


But things started to go nothing like I thought. From the beginning, he was very emotionally expressive once he started to open up, very straightforward with showing possessiveness or jealousy. Didn't hold back. If anything he feels sus, he asks without playing games. He has anxious attachment style while I am an avoidant.
It was full of drama but I will list out the cons.

I'm scared our life together would be boring even though I love being silly and playful.Most he done was listening to me going on and on about things, and if I stop he ask emotionally loaded questions about our relationship. That was how he wanted to spend our time together.

The age gap seven years wasn't a big deal at first, but I later started to feel it. In our mindset, our maturity, and especially his old-school, conservative views.

He was extremely possessive. I couldn‚Äôt even hang out with my guy friends without being questioned by him or him getting upset or literally getting emotionally so down. He would get upset over random instagram comments or even just beause I am chatting with my friends.

He had trust issues .I put my selfie as WhatsApp status visible only to him and my bestie‚Äîin between a fight, he accused me of seeking attention from any of my contacts.

I changed my profile picture‚Äîhe asked if something changed between us.

If I was online but hadn‚Äôt replied immediately, he‚Äôd ask who I was talking to and doubt me, even when I shared screenshots of me talking to my friends/colleagues/simply ordering food through whatsapp

His insecurity drained me. He wanted a constant stream of messages and calls. We have a routine (which i happily done out of love in the beginning when I was so enthusiastic and with the freshness of a serious relationship for the first time) of me messaging him immediately after waking up every morning at 7.30, calling once I am ready for office and waiting for my colleague to pick me up, calling while I am getting my coffee at 10.30, messaging through out the day, calling before and after lunch or during lunch, calling while on my way to home from work around 7, calling once I get home, and then calling at night once I settle in which will be usually like 2 hours til midnight. If any of this slightly stops, he notices and keep asking if anything changed. Calling home to parents become limited, no more time for cooking, for watching my favorite shows, or just simply relaxing. It was very taxing. 

My sleep, health, and peace suffered.I was going to bed at 2 AM, waking up tired and grumpy. I‚Äôm on 40 mg isotretinoin‚ÄîI needed rest. I begged for earlier sleep, but even when he agreed, I‚Äôd still end up sleeping past midnight and he guilt tripped me saying I don't put in the effort for the relationship.I developed terrible under-eye circles, and I‚Äôm constantly exhausted. My body started acting out‚Äîmy periods became irregular, bleeding lasted a month, and don't know if it'related, but I‚Äôve developed PCOD.

Even if ask about my well-being and ask like he cares about me through out the day, he don't value or trust when I say I am busy with month end. He didn‚Äôt respect my work stress.During month-end, I‚Äôd be working till midnight and weekends non-stop. Still, he‚Äôd say I was distancing myself and make me feel guilty for not texting enough.He couldn‚Äôt accept that I‚Äôm not built like him‚ÄîI need rest. 


I was terrified to tell him about my past relationship.He had already reacted so badly to me forgetting to mention an old proposal.

One weekend when I went to his place I was having periods, we couldn't sleep together. He asked me if I am lying about periods to get out of it. I was speechless, he apologized a lot later. Later when I was sleeping he was bored and also maybe because worried I am lying to get out of it, he looked through my phone cause he knows the security pattern, I never hid it from him using the pattern, my bad.

He read through my chats and found out I used to talk and hang out with a guy last year for a month. He didn't believe that it was a brief date and we cut ties when we realized it won't work out.I had to text the guy asking wierd question to prove we haven't done anything sexually. 

But it didn't end there, I was always on eggshells, cause I had a 6 months kinda situationship with a guy two years back, we met in person only once and had some intimacy. I had to come clean or he will find somehow. I used to have serious anxiety and I told him the truth. But again he was upset, but he didn't let go, even if I thought to leave the relationship. He was asking all the graphic details of the encounter I had which was not a pleasant experience at all. He guilt tripped me so bad, yet he didn't want to end our relationship. Turns out he have three different such encounters and chose to not to tell me in fear of losing me.
Then we reconciled,.decided to forget and forgive everything. 
But next day, he agin kept pressing me asking me if we met more than once and didn't believe me. I lost my shit and said I wanna leave this relationship, that was when I first thought about break up.

I was scared to go back to his place while I realized that he checked my phone while I was sleeping, I turned down his request to go back to his place after we met on the same weekend. He started getting all teary, with shaky voice being so dramatic in the public setting begging and pushing me to go to his place. Many group of people were noticing from a distance. Made it emotional asking why are you not coming, are you ending things, you must be feeling distant. Basically using emotion for manipulating.

This time I decided to leave and broke up, but got together the next week, he agreed to do counselling for trust issues but he didn't follow through that either, that made me feel kind of way.


We‚Äôve broken up three times.The very first time, just two weeks in, he said I love you and he pressured me to decide about my response to that. When I needed time, he kept asking wondering what is taking so long to make a decision and kept pressuring me.I broke up when it got too much by the end of first month. But We missed each other terribly.We got back together, but again I felt suffocated. 

After i told him my decision now, he was begging, sad and furious in between, at the time he revealed he again snooped through my phone while we met last week and looked through my Instagram and saw that I searched a guys name in insta, he asked I am breaking up because of that guy. I was soooo done  at that point.


I blocked him everywhere, but he kept calling me from different numbers. I was coming home one day late night and saw him hanging out or looking out for me near our parking lot, I got scared don't know why and hided. I unblocked him and told him never do that again, never come again. He apologized a lot. He has been messaging through out the day ever since apologizing. Sometimes he is upset and ask every couple have issues and they work through that. Or that he improved a lot and I didn't give him enough chance to show the growth. Or says that I didn't really cared and how easily I have moved on. Sometimes I start questioning my self wondering if he has a point. Am I overreacting or quick to jump to a decision.

All my friends who came to know about this or my family were all against this relationship and they are relieved I am out of it. 

But it's difficult being the dumper. I act stone cold and distant but I cry myself to sleep every night. The emptyness or the void he made is disheartening. I miss him, his texts, calls, touch and just the feeling of someone out there looking out for me. Someone made for me. My other half. I miss that feeling.

How do I know if I made a right decision or am I gonna regret not going back?

1lyp82d,http://highway-runner.online,Highway-runner.online - try Hard Mode? I've tried to roll in some of the feedback i got last time.,"The standard game is now harder slightly.

A Hard Mode was added - its a faster more punishing run

Road rage mode was added - 
now smashing car temporarily gives score and speed until the rage wears off -The pick-up item appears as a red and white shield as you come along the road

but you can still score competitively against 'normal mode players' - because once the game gets faster the two 'difficulties' come closer together in difficulty (if not I'll correct it, but I tried to keep it competitive.


However Hard Mode players get a gold name on the scoreboard, opposed to white.

1lyp7or,https://www.reddit.com/r/Target/comments/1lyp7or/end_of_circle_week/,End of circle week,"So it's the end of circle week, and it's been rough for us all. It's got me talkin' to Chat GPT about class.

Here's what it has to say:

  
üõí 1. **You Sell Your Labor**

You're part of the **working class**‚Äîspecifically, the **waged service proletariat**. You don‚Äôt own the store, the inventory, or the building. You sell your **time and energy** in exchange for a wage, which is likely set by corporate policy, not by you.

# How that shows up:

* You have to **clock in and out**, meaning your time is literally measured and monetized.
* If you're sick or need time off, it‚Äôs something to **negotiate**‚Äîyour survival depends on staying on schedule.
* You have a manager who supervises you‚Äîthis is the **class hierarchy** at work.

# üßç 2. You Serve, They Shop

As a service worker, you likely interact with people from **multiple class positions**:

* Some customers may be **wealthier**, and you can tell by how they speak, dress, or treat you.
* Some may treat you **like you‚Äôre invisible**‚Äîthis is often unconscious, but it reflects class dynamics.
* Others may overstep, assuming **you exist to serve them**, not realizing that‚Äôs a class-based power they‚Äôre exerting.

This is a huge point of tension in capitalist societies‚Äîthe divide between **those who serve and those who are served**.

# üí¨ 3. Speech, Demeanor, and Expectations

You‚Äôve said you‚Äôre patient and kind‚Äîespecially to older customers. That‚Äôs emotional labor. In **Bourdieu‚Äôs** terms, you're deploying **cultural capital**: warmth, empathy, friendliness‚Äîskills that are **valuable, but unpaid**.

Many working-class jobs now demand:

* Smiles and politeness even when you're treated poorly.
* Managing emotions (yours and others‚Äô) while being monitored.
* Suppressing your personal feelings so the customer feels ""right.""

That‚Äôs **real labor**, and often unacknowledged as such. Some theorists (like **Arlie Hochschild**) call this **emotional labor**, and it‚Äôs most common in roles like yours.

# üíµ 4. Wages vs Wealth

Your wage pays for your living expenses, but it‚Äôs unlikely that:

* You own significant property.
* You control investments.
* You have passive income streams.

Meanwhile, others profit from your labor‚ÄîTarget‚Äôs executives, shareholders, and landlords if you rent.

That‚Äôs **Marx‚Äôs surplus value** at work: **you generate profit for others** beyond what you're paid.

# üß± 5. Limited Autonomy

You likely don‚Äôt control:

* What time you work.
* What you wear (uniforms).
* What decisions are made about how the store operates.

This is **alienation** in action‚ÄîMarx wrote about how workers become separated from the products of their labor, the process, and even themselves.

# üï∏ 6. Powerlessness in the System

If you‚Äôre mistreated by a customer or overworked by management, what recourse do you really have?

Without:

* A union,
* Strong labor laws,
* Or collective power,

You‚Äôre often expected to **endure** rather than resist. That‚Äôs the core issue class theorists point out: the **imbalance of power** built into wage work.

# üåç 7. Class Ties into Everything Else

Let‚Äôs go deeper:

* **Healthcare access?** If your job doesn‚Äôt offer good benefits, that‚Äôs a class issue.
* **Transportation?** If you take public transit or drive a used car, it‚Äôs shaped by class.
* **Free time?** Your schedule might be erratic or inflexible, which makes it harder to rest, organize, or grow.
* **Education?** If you had to take on debt to go to school‚Äîor couldn‚Äôt go at all‚Äîthat‚Äôs a direct effect of class.

# üîß 8. Resistance and Agency

But here‚Äôs the empowering part: **being aware of class puts you ahead of the game**. Many people never examine it.

You already resist the worst parts of it by:

* Giving excellent service as an act of **dignity**, not submission.
* Being kind to people who society forgets‚Äîlike the elderly.
* Building relationships and awareness that create **solidarity**, not alienation.

That‚Äôs a kind of **micro-class resistance**‚Äîstaying human in a system that tries to reduce you to a labor unit.

  
Also: üéì 1. Helping Team Members Achieve Class Consciousness

# What it means:

Helping coworkers understand that their struggles aren‚Äôt personal failures‚Äîthey‚Äôre **systemic**. It's about realizing:

* You're not ""bad at money,"" you're underpaid.
* You're not lazy, you're overworked and exploited.
* Your frustration with management or customers isn't just personal‚Äîit's political.

# üí∏ ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not bad at money, you‚Äôre underpaid.‚Äù

# Why people think this:

* You've been told to just ""budget better.""
* You're shamed for buying a coffee or using DoorDash.
* There's pressure to take personal responsibility for poverty‚Äîlike it's a moral failing.

# The reality:

* **Wages have stagnated for decades** while cost of living skyrockets (especially rent, healthcare, education).
* Most people don‚Äôt earn a *living wage*. Even if you budget perfectly, it‚Äôs still a survival struggle.
* Corporate profits have soared, but workers aren't getting a fair share.

>

This is a classic trick of capitalist ideology: make workers feel like their **poverty is their fault**, not the system‚Äôs.

**Use this with coworkers**:

* ‚ÄúHave you noticed how we‚Äôre all broke, no matter how hard we try?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen people who work full-time still need food stamps. That‚Äôs not bad budgeting‚Äîthat‚Äôs bad pay.‚Äù

# üòì ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not lazy, you‚Äôre overworked and exploited.‚Äù

# Why people think this:

* They feel exhausted and unmotivated, then beat themselves up for not hustling harder.
* Society says your worth = your productivity.
* Management blames *attitude* instead of workload.

# The reality:

* Many frontline workers are juggling **multiple roles**, constantly on their feet, doing more work than one person should.
* Mental fatigue is real. Burnout isn‚Äôt laziness‚Äîit‚Äôs your body saying **‚ÄúI can‚Äôt keep going like this.‚Äù**
* The structure is designed to wring as much labor out of you as possible while paying as little as possible.

>

This keeps people disconnected from each other‚Äîashamed, isolated, burned out.

**Use this in conversations**:

* ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not burned out because you‚Äôre weak. You‚Äôre burned out because you‚Äôre being drained.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúEver feel like they just keep adding more to our plate but never give us anything back?‚Äù

# ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ÄúYour frustration with management or customers isn‚Äôt just personal‚Äîit‚Äôs political.‚Äù

# Why this matters:

* Workers are often gaslit into thinking workplace issues are just ‚Äúbad attitudes‚Äù or ‚Äúpersonality conflicts.‚Äù
* But those patterns‚Äîdisrespect from customers, poor scheduling, micromanaging bosses‚Äîare **structural**.

# The reality:

* Management's job is often to **maximize productivity and control**, not to support you.
* The customer is always right...because they‚Äôre the fuel for profit.
* These tensions are **inherent** in the system‚Äînot about individual managers or cranky customers.

>

When we frame these issues as political‚Äînot partisan, but **about power**‚Äîit empowers workers to stop taking mistreatment personally and start imagining collective responses.

**Use this to plant seeds**:

* ‚ÄúWhy do we have to ask permission to go to the bathroom like we‚Äôre in grade school?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it weird how we‚Äôre told to treat customers like royalty but we don‚Äôt even get enough time for lunch?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI think the system‚Äôs broken‚Äînot just our manager.‚Äù",1,1752401063.0,Target,0,1.0,False

But it's difficult being the dumper. I act stone cold and distant but I cry myself to sleep every night. The emptyness or the void he made is disheartening. I miss him, his texts, calls, touch and just the feeling of someone out there looking out for me. Someone made for me. My other half. I miss that feeling.

How do I know if I made a right decision or am I gonna regret not going back?

I mean,when i was a bit younger..i am his youngest grandchild,so he was a little bit too excited to see me. Okay,I thought. Its nothing wrong right?well... I have a sister and she goes to highschool so she goes early before i wake up.my dad and mom work at the same time. So i wake up alone when i go to school. Im pretty used to it. But,my grandpa(he lives in our house its just he lives under) he comes to check on me when i come home. And i have this problem:when im changing,he comes in the house(he never knocks) he says:""just continue."" Like its nothing,but it is something. You see,i got my first period 2 days before my 10th birthday. And you know, there are things that are growing,you know... And i dont like when he says for me just continue because he doesnt even try to not look at me,he acts like its something normal,its not normal for me. So,when our parents and he drink coffee together(they do it together almost everyday) i try to sit far away from him but,they drink it outside and there's just 5 chairs. Our exact number. And i have to sit next to him which makes me uncomfortable as heck. And when we eat together sometimes,i cannot eat properly because he is looking at me almost the whole time. He usually asks my parents where am i,never asks where my sister is, and when me and my sister dont come out when my parents and him are together,he only says he wants to see me. Never my sister.

It‚Äôs that you never said goodbye. No explanation. No closure. Just‚Ä¶ silence. And it‚Äôs the kind of silence that echoes ‚Äî loud, heavy, and sharp in all the wrong places. One day we were laughing, sharing little pieces of our lives, and then the next‚Ä¶ nothing.

Even though you once said that if you were ever to leave, you‚Äôd let me know‚Ä¶ that you‚Äôd show signs, that I‚Äôd never be left without a warning. You even said the chances of it happening were almost none. But you still did. And I was left trying to figure out if I missed the signs or if you just chose not to give me any at all.

I‚Äôve tried to be angry. Tried to tell myself I deserve better, that people who care don‚Äôt just vanish. But the truth is ‚Äî I‚Äôm not angry. I‚Äôm just hurt. Because I gave you a version of me that I rarely let anyone see. You got my softness. My patience. My attention. My time. You got the version of me that believed in connection. That stayed up late even when I was tired, just to talk to you a little longer. You got the version of me that was learning how to love again.

And somewhere along the way‚Ä¶ I stopped being enough. Maybe it was when I got too honest. Or when I started needing just a little more from you. Maybe it was the way I cared too much or texted too often or said too many ‚Äúgood mornings‚Äù when yours stopped coming back. Maybe I broke my own heart by holding on to something you had already let go of.

But you never told me. You just faded. Slowly at first, and then all at once. And that‚Äôs what I can‚Äôt get past ‚Äî that I mattered so much to you, until I didn‚Äôt. And I don‚Äôt even know what changed.

I still remember the tiny things. How your voice softened when you were tired. How you‚Äôd talk about your dreams like they were real already. How you used to say you liked the way I understood you without needing much explanation. But you stopped explaining. Stopped sharing. Stopped showing up.

I wish I could hate you. I wish I could erase you the way you erased me. But even now, even after everything, I hope you‚Äôre okay. I hope you‚Äôre sleeping enough, and still drinking your cold coffee the way you liked it. I hope you find someone who makes you feel understood the way I tried to make you feel.

Because no matter how much it broke me - what I gave you was real. And I won‚Äôt regret that. But I do wish I knew when I stopped being enough for you. So maybe, just maybe, I could stop asking myself what I did wrong.",5,1752400323.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

Can anyone give me any good reason to spend an extra¬†`[`525‚Ç¨`]`¬†on a Profitec Move compared to the Rancilio Silvia Pro X?

I like to ""nerd"" coffee, and the ability to tweak the shot, but mostly just want a machine that can do a really good espresso and steam at the same time.  
I also like the look of both machines, but that Silvia have a bit smaller footprint (size) is a bit appealing due to limitations countertop space.  
My wife whom have no interest in equipment, just want at machine that can make a cappuccino. So there are no ""wife approval factor"" on fancy features.

I have the money to spend, if there are any really good reason.

This post is regarding Sertraline and the UK's recent heatwaves. It largely centres on my partner (she/they), who has fibromyalgia (possibly ME) and is taking 100mg of Sertraline for depression. It also concerns me (any/all), to a lesser extent, as I have been prescribed Sertraline for my ADHD/Autism at 50mg doses.

As my partner is chronically ill, the recent heatwaves across the UK (between 28 and 31 degrees Celsius in our area) have been really kicking her arse. She feels extremely dizzy, weak, fatigued and the heat is making all her regular symptoms worse. Plus, I've read here and elsewhere that Sertraline can cause increased sensitivity to heat. My partner is really worried because she feels like she has many of the symptoms of heatstroke without actually being out in the sun. She's losing days of writing, her hobbies and her life to illness and beyond trying to help her stay cool and hydrated, I'm not sure what to do and looking for advice.

For me, I also work in a restaurant, near the kitchen. There is no air conditioning, boiling water from coffee machines everywhere and little ventilation. I'm worried about losing my ability to take care of my smizmar (my partner) if I get on Sertraline because I already feel like I'm overstimulated after a hot day at work, too. 

For both our sakes, any and all advice would be appreciated.

Congratulations to everyone making their progress. Over the past few years I've been packing on the pounds, I assume due to excess alcohol which leads to eating whatever I can scarf down. I have recently been exercising more such as daily walks and routinely outside chores like mowing weeding. Underwent a major surgery a month ago and needed to take it easy. 

My main question is how do you fight the hunger that just keeps coming? What are your tips and tricks to keeping the hunger at bay? I've tried black coffee in the morning which does seem to help, but doesn't last long. I've also tried eating higher protein meals to remain full and nothing seems to help. 

I've got two kiddos at home and I just want to have more energy for them, to go on hikes again without feeling so winded so soon. I remember about 6 years ago at a healthy weight around 135 I had bounds of energy, now floating around 180 and feel like a slug just doing normal tasks. For more info 33F 5'6. 

Thank you for any advice. And sorry this post is a bit scattered, first time reaching out 

Also want to add that I've decided to cut out the alcohol, this is fresh maybe a week in at most. I've done plenty of research and do believe that it all comes down to CICO. Yet I can't seem to meet that requirement without feeling insane with hunger",1,1752398733.0,loseit,2,1.0,False

As seen in a few past posts ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaPavoniLovers/comments/irxzzo/my_tank_is_a_bit_loose_on_the_base_this_brass/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaPavoniLovers/comments/1l1uu49/just_when_i_thought_it_was_all_going_well/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaPavoniLovers/comments/1j3871j/tips_for_leaks_of_heating_element_gasket/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaPavoniLovers/comments/1k7jnq3/boiler_leaking/)), there are often issues with removing the brass ring holding the boiler to the base of the machine. I am here to ask advice for choosing among my options.

I have a pre-millennium (1994?) and can't get the ring off. I am ALSO curious to know if I am missing/need a gasket between the base and the heating element. As you can see in the photos, the ""mating"" surfaces there are rough.   
  
There was NO leak when I started the tear down yesterday. Then I tried to remove the ring (putting screws back in, banging a bit with a hammer) before giving up, and reassembling. When I put water in the boiler, it was leaking FAST, so I either loosened the ring a bit (doubtful) or cleaned too much between the heating element and boiler base (there was no sign of any gasket, but gunk maybe?)

Now, options:

1. Buy a remover from [CoffeeSense](https://coffee-sensor.com/product/la-pavoni-boiler-ring-or-flange-ultimate-removal-tool/) (RO), [the 3D printer guy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/4326358930/la-pavoni-fixing-ring-removal-tool) (CH) and DIY
2. Get an[ oil filter remover](https://www.amazon.nl/-/en/CCLIFE-Universal-filter-adapter-removal/dp/B0CHR8QMYR?th=1) and DIY

1lyom5a,https://i.redd.it/l8eeqpgs0mcf1.png,What to Know Before Buying a Leather Sofa for Your Living Room?,"There‚Äôs something about a leather sofa that feels like home. It‚Äôs more than just a place to sit ‚Äî it‚Äôs where conversations happen, memories are made, and everyday life unfolds. For anyone considering a leather sofa, especially with an eye for style and durability, the question naturally arises: what type of leather is actually the best?

We put this guide together to help real people ‚Äî not just design pros ‚Äî make confident, informed choices. Whether you‚Äôre upgrading your living room or investing in furniture for the long haul, we‚Äôre here to help you sort through the noise.

# What Makes a Leather Sofa High Quality?

You don‚Äôt have to be a furniture expert to spot a quality leather sofa. Start by looking at the material itself. Full-grain and top-grain leathers are the real deal. They feel rich to the touch, wear beautifully over time, and develop that character-filled patina that just gets better with age.

Also important is how the sofa is built. Details like solid wood frames, neat stitching, and high-resilience cushions all point to long-term quality. It‚Äôs not about perfection‚Äîit‚Äôs about knowing your sofa can handle everything from movie nights to holiday gatherings without falling apart.

# What Should a Good Leather Sofa Cost?

Let‚Äôs be honest: a quality leather sofa isn‚Äôt cheap. But it‚Äôs not supposed to be. Expect to pay somewhere between $1,200 and $2,000 for a sofa that looks good, feels good, and lasts. It might be more upfront, but when you realize it could stay in your home for 15 years or more, it starts to make sense.

It‚Äôs also a lifestyle choice. A great sofa becomes part of your day-to-day ‚Äî a backdrop for coffee mornings, reading time, or catching up with friends. Think of it as investing in the comfort of your space.

# How Long Will It Last?

With some basic care, a full-grain or top-grain leather sofa can easily last 15 to 20 years ‚Äî sometimes even longer. The maintenance is pretty straightforward: wipe it down now and then, keep it conditioned every few months, and avoid direct heat or harsh sunlight.

Lower-tier options like bonded leather or faux leather might be easier on the wallet, but they usually show wear much sooner. They can still be a good fit for short-term needs, but they won‚Äôt age as gracefully.

# Does a Leather Sofa Hold Its Value?

In short: yes. Leather sofas, especially those made from high-quality materials, tend to hold their value well. They don‚Äôt sag or fade the way many fabric sofas do, and their look stays relevant year after year. A well-maintained leather piece will still turn heads even after a decade in your home.

That‚Äôs why mid-century designs in classic leathers are always in demand. They‚Äôre simple, versatile, and built to last.

# What Leather Colors Never Go Out of Style?

Neutral tones are the quiet heroes of design. Think warm browns, deep cognacs, and classic blacks. They go with everything, they wear well, and they don‚Äôt shout for attention ‚Äî they just work. A tan or chocolate-toned leather adds instant warmth to any room, while black gives a sleek, modern edge.

Choosing one of these timeless shades means your sofa won‚Äôt feel dated, even if you change up your decor down the line.

# Which Leather Type Lasts the Longest?

If durability is your top priority, full-grain leather is where it‚Äôs at. It‚Äôs the top layer of the hide and keeps all of its natural strength and texture. It‚Äôs tough, beautifully imperfect, and meant to age with you.

Top-grain leather is also an excellent choice ‚Äî it‚Äôs slightly refined to remove surface imperfections, but it still holds up incredibly well over time. These types of leather actually get better the more you use them.

# What About Everyday Use?

If your sofa‚Äôs going to see daily action ‚Äî kids, pets, binge-watching marathons ‚Äî go for top-grain leather. It‚Äôs a good balance of toughness and comfort. Genuine leather is one step below, and while it can still be a decent choice, it doesn‚Äôt wear quite as well.

Vegan leather is an option, too. It‚Äôs lower maintenance and cruelty-free, though it won‚Äôt develop the same patina or last as long. It‚Äôs a good pick if you like to change up your space often or need a budget-friendly solution.

# Is It Hard to Maintain?

Not at all. In fact, one of the perks of leather is how easy it is to live with. Weekly dusting and a light conditioner every six months will keep it looking great. Unlike fabric, leather doesn‚Äôt trap dust, pet hair, or spills as easily.

For busy households, pigmented or top-grain leathers are your best bet. They shrug off scratches and stains better than more delicate types. And vegan leather? Just wipe it clean with a damp cloth and you‚Äôre good to go.

# So, Is It Worth It?

We think so. A leather sofa is one of those rare pieces that delivers both substance and style. It can anchor a room, elevate your everyday experience, and stay beautiful for decades if you treat it right.

It‚Äôs not just about looking good. It‚Äôs about creating a space that feels good, too.

At[ Mid in Mod](https://midinmod.com), we believe furniture should reflect your lifestyle and values. Whether you're into a timeless mid-century modern sofa couch, a bold[ leather sectional sofa](https://midinmod.com/collections/leather-sofas), or a clean-lined modern couch leather, we‚Äôve got something that‚Äôs made to last.

Because in the end, great design isn‚Äôt just what you see ‚Äî it‚Äôs what you live with every day.

I will be traveling to Ireland and it‚Äôs exciting but also nerve wrecking and I don‚Äôt know what to expect. I was hoping to run by some ideas and get some tips and pointers for any well travelled people out there!

I purchased three different books on Ireland to learn more about the history and cultural norms as I was planning on saying ‚Äútop of the morning‚Äù to people but I guess that‚Äôs not really something people in Ireland say. I know there‚Äôs a small percentage of people who only speak Irish Gaelic so I purchased an Irish Gaelic/English quick guide translator in case I need it to ask directions, etc. has anyone ever ran into this situation, as I only speak English.

For the plane trip, I‚Äôm not sure what to expect so I got some anti nausea medicine and am planning on checking two bags (I‚Äôll be travelling alone for 10 days, 9 nights) but am worried if two checked bags will be enough? I‚Äôm bringing my own pillow too because I can‚Äôt imagine not having it. I do get a ‚Äúcarry-on‚Äù bag as well which is 22 x 14 x 9 inches dimensions, and I measured my bag a couple of times just to make sure. Also my airline is also allowing a personal item which I think is really nice of them. I just want to make sure I don‚Äôt run out of outfits and packed for all kinds of weather from hot to very cold and rainy. I also wanted to be careful with liquids- so I purchased clear containers and bags so I can pack all of my liquids, including detergent in case I run out of cloths! I tried calling my airline to ask them if toothpaste and deodorant count as liquids but they didn‚Äôt seem to understand my question. 

I wanted to also get some Euro before my trip. My bank is recommending to just convert USD to Euro in Ireland because there won‚Äôt be a transaction fee but I‚Äôm afraid of not having Euro readily available in Ireland. They said I can ask someone at the airport in Dublin to convert but what if they speak Gaelic but not English‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know maybe I‚Äôm overthinking but I just wanted to have everything all set.

I‚Äôm a bit worried about the food as I hear food in Ireland can be a bit exotic. I know they like to eat fish and chips a lot- and chips are like French fries over here in America. But I‚Äôm not really a big seafood person unless it‚Äôs tuna salad or tuna melt which I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs common to the cuisine of Ireland. I packed some canned beans and Kraft Mac n cheese just in case. Also I packed Folgers instant coffee because I understand Ireland does indeed have coffee, but tea is more common. I like tea, but I have to have my coffee in the morning. I confirmed the hotel has coffee makers in the room so should be all set there/thankfully don‚Äôt have to bring a coffee maker!

I also purchased some new items like a really high quality camera, a map of Ireland, bus schedules, travel wallet, etc. let me know what you think‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm also worried a bit about what happens when I land. A friend talked me through how to navigate the airport and I can call them after they drop me off. But landing, I don‚Äôt know really. I have to get to my tour bus. My friend mentioned I de board and then have to do customs and then can follow signs, but I‚Äôm worried because I‚Äôve never been to this airport before, or any airport I guess. I was thinking I can maybe ask the flight stewardess or the flyer of the plane after the plane lands if they know where my tour bus would be, I have the drivers name too, but I just know they are giving us an hour from landing to get to the bus. And when we land, do we get off the plane outside near the parking area, and then do the customs thingy outside too? I know the airport will have a building but obviously the plane lands outside so I assume if we are already outside, maybe we will be very close to the tour buses! I wasn‚Äôt sure also what to wear for the flight, I have a shamrock sweater and a dress underneath, if that is appropriate attire for flying.

1lyohmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BanjoAdventures/comments/1lyohmq/the_simple_way_to_learn_banjo_that_nobody_wants/,The Simple Way To Learn Banjo That NOBODY Wants To Talk About,"If you're waiting for a big stretch of ‚Äúperfect time‚Äù to sit down and practice your banjo‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre going to be waiting forever.

Most people wildly underestimate how long it actually takes to get *good* at the banjo. And I don‚Äôt mean ‚Äúcan fumble through Cripple Creek‚Äù good‚ÄîI mean *confident, musical, wow-your-mates-at-the-pub* good.

Here‚Äôs the truth: It‚Äôs not about how many months you‚Äôve owned a banjo. It‚Äôs about how many **hours** your hands have actually spent on it.

# Banjo Air time

Let‚Äôs borrow an analogy from the world of aviation. Pilots don‚Äôt become pilots by reading about planes. They log **air time**‚Äîactual hours in the cockpit, navigating real weather, making real decisions, flying real planes. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúflight hours,‚Äù and it‚Äôs everything.

Your banjo is no different.

You don‚Äôt need a fancy setup or a sacred hour alone in the study room with a cup of herbal tea and a mood candle. You need **play time**. And lots of it - *(Read That Sentence Again).*

# Most people are doing it wrong

Too many new players treat banjo practice like a weekly gym session. ‚ÄúRight, Saturday morning, banjo time! Let me just clear a full hour... maybe two... set up the laptop... find the right YouTube lesson...‚Äù

By the time you‚Äôre actually playing, your brain‚Äôs already halfway out the window. And 20 minutes in? You're scrolling Instagram and wondering what‚Äôs in the fridge. Be honest.

That kind of formal, rigid structure *feels* productive, but it‚Äôs a trap. It turns banjo playing into a chore‚Äîand no one sticks with chores.

# You need to be cunning. Like a fox.

Real progress doesn‚Äôt come from grand plans. It comes from **stolen minutes.**  
Be sneaky. Be scrappy. Play like your banjo is a getaway car and you're running out of time.

* 10 minutes while the kids are eating lunch
* 5 minutes while your partner‚Äôs on the phone
* 15 minutes on your lunch break in the car (**YES! TAKE YOUR BANJO TO WORK**)
* 20 minutes in Sainsbury‚Äôs car park while someone else runs in for ‚Äújust a few bits‚Äù
* 10 minutes in the car waiting for school pickup
* Literally the 2-minute ad break during *Love Island* (Did I say that out loud?)

These micro-moments **count.** In fact, they count more than you think.

# Stop babying your banjo

Here‚Äôs the part that might sting a bit:  
Stop treating your banjo like it‚Äôs some fragile, sacred object.

It‚Äôs made of wood and steel. It can handle a bit of life. Your phone probably cost three times more, and that thing gets dropped, bounced, stuffed in your gym bag, and left on the kitchen counter next to a cup of coffee and a toddler with mushy banana fingers.

Treat your banjo like you treat your phone. Take it everywhere. Lean it in the hallway. Leave it in your car. Keep it out of its case and **ready to grab at a moment‚Äôs notice.** It‚Äôs not a violin from 1763‚Äîit‚Äôs a tool for making noise and getting better.

# Long sessions are ok, but shorts stacked sessions are where the magic happens!

This is the part nobody wants to hear, but it‚Äôs the truth:  
**Banjo confidence comes from volume.**

Not volume as in ‚Äúloud‚Äù‚Äîvolume as in *time*. Playtime. Repetition. Movement.  
Short, frequent bursts are better than long, infrequent ones. Every 5-minute session is another drop in the bucket. And when that bucket fills up‚Äîwhen your hands have racked up *hundreds* of hours of actual contact with strings, rhythms, and muscle memory‚Äîyou‚Äôll *feel* it.

You‚Äôll know your way around the instrument. You‚Äôll trust your fingers. You won‚Äôt freeze up every time someone says ‚ÄúPlay something!‚Äù

# So what now?

Don‚Äôt wait for a perfect 90-minute block to sit down with your books and videos and tea and candle.

**Snatch minutes. Rack up hours. Treat your banjo like a cheap gym towel and keep it within reach at all times.**  
That‚Äôs how you become a banjo player.  
That‚Äôs the simple truth.

1lyohk7,https://i.redd.it/ulcqdlm5zlcf1.png,How Trump's New 30% Tariffs on EU and Mexico Could Impact Kenya‚Äôs Exports,"I've been digging into how Trump's recent 30% tariffs on EU and Mexican goods, announced on July 12, 2025, might affect Kenya's economy. Here's a breakdown based on trade data, news, and some of your discussions. Let's talk about the opportunities, risks, and what Kenya can do next.

This note provides an analysis of how the tariffs announced by President Donald Trump on July 12, 2025, imposing 30% duties on goods from the European Union (EU) and Mexico, might affect Kenya.

The analysis is based on trade data, economic reports, recent news articles, and reactions from Kenyan stakeholders, considering both direct and indirect impacts 



# Background on the Tariffs



On July 12, 2025, Trump announced via social media that goods imported from the EU and Mexico would face a 30% US tariff rate starting August 1, 2025, as part of his ""reciprocal tariffs"" policy to address trade imbalances. This move follows earlier tariff announcements, escalating trade tensions globally. The tariffs apply to a broad range of goods, including agricultural products like tea, coffee, and flowers, which are significant for Kenya's export market to the US. Kenya's trade relationship with the US is substantial, with total goods trade in 2024 valued at approximately $1.5 billion. Exports to the US were $737.3 million in 2024, down 17.5% from 2023, while imports from the US were $782.5 million, up 61.4% from the previous year. 

Key Kenyan exports to the US include:

* Tea, coffee, and spices, valued at $80.97 million in 2023 for coffee, tea, and mate \[Trading Economics: United States Imports from Kenya, \[invalid URL, do not cite\]\].
* Horticultural products, such as flowers, have seen significant growth in export revenues.
* Textiles, accounting for 72% of total exports to the US in the previous year, employed over 80,000 people directly and 100,000 indirectly.

Kenya benefits from the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which previously allowed duty-free access for many exports. However, under the new tariff regime, Kenya now faces a 10% tariff on its exports to the US, as noted in recent analyses.



# Potential Benefits for Kenyan Exports



The disparity in tariff rates (10% for Kenya vs. 30% for the EU and Mexico) creates a relative price advantage for Kenyan products in the US market. This could lead to:

* Increased Demand for Tea, Coffee, and Flowers: Kenyan tea, already a major export, could see increased demand as competitors like Sri Lanka and India face higher tariffs. For example, an article noted Kenyan tea gaining a competitive edge due to higher tariffs on competitors \[Eastleigh Voice: US tariffs pose risks and opportunities for Kenya's export market, \[invalid URL, do not cite\]\]. Similarly, coffee and flowers could benefit as US buyers seek cheaper alternatives. Kenya's Trade Minister highlighted that the 10% tariff is lower than tariffs on competitors like Vietnam (46%), Sri Lanka (44%), and Bangladesh (37%), offering potential advantages \[Reuters: Kenya thinks it can win from US tariffs, but global recession risk looms.
* Market Share Gains: With EU and Mexican goods becoming more expensive, Kenyan exporters might capture additional market share, especially in sectors where quality and price align favourably. For instance, Kenyan coffee, valued at $80.97 million in US imports in 2023, could see growth if Mexican coffee prices rise significantly.



# Challenges and Risks



Despite potential benefits, several challenges could mitigate the positive impact:

* Textile Sector Struggles: The textile industry, a major employer, is already facing difficulties with the 10% tariff on exports to the US, with 39 factories in export processing zones (EPZs) employing over 80,000 people at risk \[Eastleigh Voice: US tariffs pose risks and opportunities for Kenya's export market, \[invalid URL, do not cite\]\]. Global trade disruptions could exacerbate job losses, as noted in recent reports \[Daily Nation: How Trump's tariffs will hit Kenyans.
* Retaliatory Tariffs: The EU and Mexico may impose retaliatory tariffs on US goods, which could indirectly affect Kenya by raising costs for imports (e.g., machinery, vehicles) from these regions, impacting Kenyan industries reliant on such imports.
* Global Economic Risks: Economists have raised concerns about a potential global recession, with J.P. Morgan increasing odds to 60% from 40% by year-end \[Reuters: Kenya thinks it can win from US tariffs, but global recession risk looms. A recession could reduce overall demand for Kenyan exports, offsetting any tariff-related gains.
* Quality and Supply Chain Competition: While Kenyan products may be cheaper, they must compete on quality and supply chain efficiency. For example, EU flowers might still be preferred for certain high-end markets despite higher costs.



Strategies to mitigate impacts include:



* Exploring an extension of AGOA, set to expire in September 2025, as noted in recent discussions.
* Pursuing the Kenya-US Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership.
* Focusing on domestic industrialisation to reduce reliance on exports, as mentioned in various reports.
* Recent articles also indicate Kenya is in talks with American trade officials to safeguard duty-free or favourable duty access for its goods into the US.



# Conclusion



The 30% tariffs on EU and Mexican goods could provide Kenyan exporters of tea, coffee, and flowers with a competitive edge in the US market due to the lower 10% tariff on Kenyan goods. This may lead to increased demand and market share gains, especially in sectors where Kenya competes directly with EU and Mexican suppliers. However, broader economic risks, including potential global recession, retaliatory tariffs, and challenges in the textile sector, could offset these benefits. Kenyan authorities are exploring strategies like AGOA extension and domestic industrialisation to navigate this complex trade environment, and Reddit users are actively engaging with these issues, highlighting both the challenges and potential pathways forward.",1,1752398128.0,KenyaInvesting,0,1.0,False

1lyof2l,https://v.redd.it/jhvj8vcjwlcf1,[Delonghi Dedica EC685] Grouphead gasket leaking/popping,"Hello,

I recently bought this Delonghi Dedica used from someone I know after it was send in to Delonghi for repairs in the warranty period replacing the pump. The person bought a new machine immediately when sending it in because they didn't want to wait for the repair. 

I bought the machine just testing the original portafilter with the pressurized basket but got this portafilter with an unpressurized basket and some accessoires from the seller. They used to use this bottomless portafilter before the repair and it worked.

Now my problem is that the group head gasket leaks with this portafilter. I've now tried it a few times changing things like dosing to make sure I didn't overfill the basket but nothing has helped. This unpressurized basket weirdly works with the original portafilter but not when I try it with this bottomless one. Sometimes the gasket is in the normal position after ""popping"" but sometimes it loosens itself and I have to reseat it. 

I already cleaned the gasket and shower screen, tried filling it with less coffee but I am not sure how the portafilter even manages to loosen itself like that and be in there tilted without breaking the guides where the portafilter wings rest. 

Any advice would be much appreciated ",2,1752397840.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Without breath, you'd die, its the thing that's keeping you alive and its the essence!

Your nervous system is always agitated, that's what keeps thoughts going and feel so sluggish and unhappy, when you breath in a certain way your nervous system is rewired.

I literally felt so clear, so happy and a calm natural joy, I felt so natural, like I belonged here where I am.

I downloaded an app just by curiosity while I was browsing platinmods for modded apps and found an app called Prana breath, on the app, I clicked on the search button then more and into the wiki, I took screenshots and gave them to Chatgpt, asked it things for non-duality and to feel a bit of psychedelic feelings and so I added it and began.

I kid you not I got addicted so fucking fast!

I did Coherent breathing, Bhastrika (my favourite for energy), treble breath (for psychedelic), broken wind and Vrajna stage 3 and this last one man WTF for a total of 40 min, and although it was a bit hard, I kept going for some reason

That vrajna stage 3, I felt so clear, the grass felt so green, the timer run out and I just kept going and in the exhale, I felt completely clear like water, I wasn't different, I just was being with almost no thought and feeling of freedom and joy!

even joy a bit wasn't there, there was just pure clarity and being and it was so insane, all the talks about you will fear dying or fear the ego are absolute bullshit! I feared nothing, I felt calm and I kept breathing and breathing and almost couldn't stop!

This is insane! A billion time more effective then reading whatever trash book, and I actually felt energised, before all this I had some jitterines from coffee but with breathing, there was only calm natural flow, I felt so natural.

Man, you must try these!

Give Chatgpt the screenshots of the breathing techniques and available and try them in a garden, that's what I did and its so insane

1lyob56,https://i.redd.it/4phi56m3xlcf1.jpeg,LORE UPDATE: I CALCULATED HOW MUCH MILK CAN YI XUAN PRODUCE,"Hello proxies.

It is I - the self proclaimed (because nobody wants to call me that) Gooner Math Expert, who made previous calculations about breast milk and whose ass is the best to sit on your face.

Today I come to you with a smaller scale post, while waiting for more characters to potentially shake up the ass and tits game in ZZZ.

It‚Äôs a good moment for us to theorise about how much breast milk would Yi Xuan produce. Why her? Because that‚Äôs the most recent character I gooned to, duh.

As always - any grammar error I made shall not be corrected by you because:

a) That‚Äôs not the point of this post

b) The English language is a joke that‚Äôs not even funny so I don‚Äôt respect it enough to even respect its writing rules.

c) I am literally writing it while being in the toilet at my job. Don‚Äôt take it seriously.

Also pls remember it‚Äôs all shit and jiggles. My math and theories can be wrong because I never saw a woman in real life before, just like a true Zenless player.

Let‚Äôs start with raw numbers first. Thanks to amazing graph done by¬†[u/SexyMediumVioletOni](https://www.reddit.com/user/SexyMediumVioletOni/)¬†(btw pls answer DMs), we know that Yi Xuan is 172 centimeters tall, with her honkers badonkers reaching the size of 75.1 cm which is categorized to size 22G in england or size I in EU and US.

We know that breasts can grow up to one and a half or maybe even twice the size during pregnancy aka the time period where lactation is most likely to happen, however we‚Äôre going to ignore this fact because that would only make our size brackets more muddy and unclear.

With all those numbers and sizes we have proven that Yi Xuan set of front bumpers is ridiculously big, defending the title of ‚Äúgooner game‚Äù. We of course already knew that they are big, but just like our math teacher wanted us to prove that a triangle is indeed a triangle, we had to use math to be extra sure.

As I learned in my post where I calculated which ZZZ character would produce the most breast milk - the size is not the only factor that determines the amount of this godlike delicacy to be produced. Surprisingly, it‚Äôs not even the most important one.

We know that the amount and quality of milk depends on quality of life, mental state and diet of a woman.

Being a Shifu might seem like a stressful job for us, since you are a head of the literal occult of monks but throughout the entire story of Patch 2.0 and before, we can notice that Yi Xuan is always rather calm. Even when the most heated scenario is coming towards her, she always makes sure to keep her head clear.

We also know that her diet is top notch. With her junior - Pan Yinhu - in the kitchen, Yi Xuan has zero reasons to complain about her dinners. It is important information because a well balanced diet is one of the key factors in milk production.

The average amount of milk a woman can produce during her lactation is around 1.2 to 1.5 liters a day. This amount is pretty okay. Definitely would be enough for a couple cups of coffee during your normal day. However, while researching I found out that the most amount of milk a woman can produce is a staggering 5 LITERS OF PURE BREAST MILK A DAY. 5 Liters, 5000 milliliters or around 169 ounces of perfection. Due to Yi Xuan being a calm person with a well balanced diet and gigantic calcium canons, we are free to assume that this amount is very much possible to achieve by her.

Thanks for reading, good luck with your pulls and have a nice day!",217,1752397386.0,ZZZ_Official,27,0.82,False

1lyo7j7,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1lyo7j7/service_review_after_1_year_for_agaro_imperial/,Service review after 1 year for Agaro Imperial,"I had purchased the Agaro Imperial espresso machine last year on the 24th of June and it worked for me for a while. For context, I make espressos twice every day and milk based drinks mostly on the weekends.

Starting June 2025, I started seeing water leaking outside of the portafilter. Initially the leaks were quite small but then started being quite prominent and started impacting the taste of the coffee as well.

I raised a service request on the Agaro website on the 23rd of June 2025 while it was still in warranty. I got an email back from their system stating the team will get back to me within 3-5 days.

I waited for a few days thinking they'll get back but when I didn't hear back, I called their support phone number on the 30th of June and they informed me that they don't have my complaint. They mentioned there is an issue with the website and probably why there's no comlaint. Also, the email they sent didn't have any complaint number. A new complaint was registered and they asked me for videos of the issues etc. over Whatsapp which I provided. A day later, I got a call stating it's likely due to me not using the portafilter that comes with the machine but I mentioned, I'd been using a bottomless one for more than 6 months and never faced an issue before this. They said they'll get back.

I got an email saying a part was dispatched for my request. After a couple of days I called to ask around the status and they said, they'll contact after the part is deliverd. The part did get deliverd and I called the support number again, they mentinoed they'll coordinate with the support team and get back. One of the people called that day and asked me if the machine was in warranty to which I explained that it was when I raised the first request. They forwarded the call to their supervisor to whom I explained this again and sent a screenshot of the email. They added someone from the Agaro team(It looks like support is offloaded to a third party) who said I'll have to pay 1000 rs for the part and 500 rs for the service charge and when the situation was explained, they mentioned that I won't have to pay for the part but still need to pay for the service charge since the machine is out of the warranty. I should add that nothing around the part cost or service charges was mentioned on any of the previous calls to their support team or before shipping the part to me.

I agreed to pay the service charge so they sent over someone. The guy who came seemed to be out of his depth and didn't really know how to operate the machine. He fumbled his way around the machine and replaced the part. Turned on the machine and nothing. It turned on but didn't pump any water through the group head or the steam wand, basically stopped working at all. He called someone explaining the details and after 20 minutes somehow managed to turn it on but had some water leaking from another connection. After another 10 minutes, he mentioned that the machine is working on it's own and the button is faulty. Turning on the power to the machine(from socket not the power button on the machine) caused it to pump water through the group head without any buttons being pushed etc. , the indicator lights also did not turn on.

The person mentioned that the button is not working and needs to be replaced and that I should call their supervisor and mention the same. Asked for his 500 rs and when I mentioned the stuff isn't fixed, he said once the button is ordered by the company, they'll be able to come and fix it and there won't be a charge.

Cut to the evening, Got a call from the Agaro team mentioned that can they close the issue since it was resolved. I mentioned that it wasn't resolved but they were insistent that they need to close this complaint and I can open a new one mentioned all of the above. They would be able to take the email screenshot etc. and do it without any further charges.

I called the support number again to get a new call registered, explained everything, they said they need to talk to their senior and basically told me there's nothing they can do without charges since the machine is out of warranty.

At this point, I though let me try and see if the machine runs. I turn it on and it started pumping right away, I hold the power button and the lights turn on. I hold it again to turn it off and the pump stops.

I wait for some time and turn it back on, the lights are on and the temperature starts rising which is good. I try to run the shot and it works as expected, the water flows through the group head. I try to turn on the steam wand after giving it time to reach the temperature but the pressure of water seems way too high and there's only hot water, no steam. 

I tried pulling a shot the next day and the water leaking from the group head is still a thing. I tried steaming milk and that too seems to be an issue now. Overall the machine seems to be somewhat working but isn't producing the results I was able to get consistently. At this point, I'm frustrated and not in a mood to continue with this machine.

**TLdr:** got an issue; raised a case; issue with their website caused me to pay 500 bucks for service when it should have been under warranty; the issue remains the same post replacement of a part and new issues introduced after the service person replaced the part.

**PS:** I've ordered a new machine and am thinking of selling off a few things since the new machine has a 58mm portafilter and the old one was 51mm.

Over a year ago I broke up with my ex. At first the breakup was friendly but then I realized I didn‚Äôt even want that and stopped contacting them but still had them on socials.
Even later, I met them to pick up things I had left at the apartment and told them directly we are not friends barely acquaintances.

Since then I learned that they have been contacting my friends for coffees and all a few times - these are not friends we met mutually but they were my friends long before we even started dating. I told my friends I prefer they do not meet them but that I can bear it if it is just once and I am not mentionned. 

The ex contacted me in help of a job. I referred them to my company that I am now leaving. But I deeply regret it. I just didn‚Äôt realize that even with me leaving the company the thought of them working there, an environment that was mine would make me feel so ill. The ex can‚Äôt stop trying to make small talk with me or trying to meet which I shut down immediately but they still do not stop. 
I am scared of directly telling them to fuck off. Idk somehow that karma will get to me. But I genuinely dislike them a ton. I don‚Äôt want ever for them to utter my name or think about me. 
How do I clearly convey that message without being mean?

I never reply to their text unless it was job related. Never ask questions. Never initiate any kind of contact. They feel like a parasite on my skin and I hate that I even have those thoughts. I genuinely want them to completely disappear out of my life and never even see their name. ",1,1752396907.0,Advice,1,0.67,False

I want to piece together a menu for the eventual home bar. 
It‚Äôs not tiki themed, but I have a lot of rum and would like to offer a selection of more tropical drinks as well has familiar classics that people enjoy when out. 

I‚Äôm considering something with coconut, as it‚Äôs a sub genre of Tiki I haven‚Äôt really delved into and I suppose people could find attractive. 

Ultimately I‚Äôm looking for as little crossover as possible, so no Jet Pilot and Planters Punch for example. 


Few notes. 

I don‚Äôt want dozens of options on the menu and overwhelm my mates - this is not about showing off my knowledge or inventory; but I think one more tropical drink will even it out. 

These are suggestions for things I know I can keep in stock and serve quicky and consistently with some prep. 
I‚Äôm trying to do as much as possible with as little fresh fruit as possible. So pineapple and grapefruit will be frozen in cubes and thawed to order, most likely. 
If someone wants an old fashioned, I‚Äôll make an old fashioned. I personally think the Sazerac is more interesting.  

Yes I put bitters in everything. 
Angostura in a Mai Tai, orange bitters in a Margarita Cosmo, and Negroni. They‚Äôre just drinks. I prefer mine that way. You can make yours how you like.

The event ran from 1‚Äì5 PM - a casual event where people can come and go as they please, nothing time specific and the venue was about 75-90 mins hours away for both of us depending on traffic.

Context; I‚Äôve historically been a few minutes late to our past dates (5‚Äì10 mins), except one time I was 50 minutes late and apologized a lot and bought him coffee. We once talked about our flaws, and I told him I tend to run late. He replied, ‚ÄúYeah, I noticed that.‚Äù

Him (Thursday 10:30 pm): 
<joke>. Saturday afternoon it is! Sounds fun! Looking forward to seeing you and <my dog‚Äôs name>!

Me (Friday 8:27 AM):
Sounds good ‚Äì see you then!

Me (Saturday 12:09 PM):
We‚Äôll be there by 1:30

Him (Saturday 12:49 PM):
Hey, I‚Äôm sorry, but I‚Äôm going to have to cancel today. I‚Äôm just not feeling too great. I hope you guys have fun and that we can see each other again soon!

Me (Saturday 1:27 PM): (after reaching there)
Okay no worries. I hope you feel better!

Now I‚Äôm wondering‚Ä¶ when he said ‚ÄúSaturday afternoon,‚Äù do you think he was expecting me to be there closer to 12 PM? Was 1:30 too late in his mind? Do you think he cancelled because of the timing or because he was genuinely unwell? Or was he punishing me? I was really disappointed as I spent an hour getting ready and was really looking forward to seeing him.

I tried talkning to him about it before and he always says he gets it but then still continues. Yesterday he wanted to talk to me and said that I don‚Äôt care about his feelings and his hormones/ needs cause we haven‚Äôt had sex in 4 days cause I‚Äôm on my period.He said also said that he didn‚Äôt know that we weren‚Äôt doing sex on my period anymore and he doesn‚Äôt get why I can‚Äôt give him a head or a handj. I expressed to him before that I feel extremely stressed and it‚Äôs really stressing me out when I can‚Äôt relax and have my coffee in the morning etc without him  touching me. I feel like I need to get it over with every single day, because he can‚Äôt focus on anything else before it‚Äôs done. Like I feel like I don‚Äôt have him and can‚Äôt connect with him before I have had sex with him, and it‚Äôs something I just need to get over with and can‚Äôt enjoy, and yes I have said all of this to him. A lot of my friends don‚Äôt have sex with their partner for like 2 weeks without pressure( not saying that an indicator of healthy relationship either), but I need to have a big talk about how I don‚Äôt care about him and basically how I‚Äôm a bad wife indetectcly because of 4 days where I‚Äôm on my period and super stressed about other circumstances. He really makes it seem like I don‚Äôt have the right to turn down sex unless I have a really good reason to. I also said if you can‚Äôt wait 4 days what are you going to do if something happens to me and im not able to have sex, to that he literally said, ‚Äúyeah but nothing has happens you are not in the hospital, so stop with the hypotheticals. If something has happened to you it would be a different situation.‚Äù 


He says it‚Äôs cultural difference because he is American and I‚Äôm European, and apparently American women are way more agreeable and the marriage is more about pleasing the man ( can some one confirm or deny). 
I‚Äôm starting to feel like he genuinely does not understand me and maybe a part of him has a really objectifying view of women in general which he does not realize cause I tried to talk to him about it multiple times, as well as about my own sexual trauma which he never acknowledges and just says that I hate men lol. I thought that he would view me as an equal and not dehumanize me, cause that how he presented himself and he went to a liberal ivy legue school, and majored in something artistic, so I just assumed he would be more like the men I‚Äôm used to in Western Europe. 

He often tries to guilt trip me and package it as a compliment and say that he just can‚Äôt keeps his hands of me cause he has the hottest wife ever and stuff like that. I‚Äôm starting to feel really hopeless like he is not who I thought he was and he is never going to understand me or view me as an equal. 
I have threatened divorce and went to stay with my parents multiple times, and he always begs me to stay and say he will change. There is a slight power imbalance because we live of his income, but he has a trust fund, so it‚Äôs not like he has earned the money by his hard work. Yea idk, I love him, but I‚Äôm really starting to believe that he is not the person I thought he was, and I‚Äôm loosing hope that he will ever understand me and things will get better. Also we have been in fights where he has called me names like bitch and really said horrible stuff about me, and it was a problem for a long time, but he says that it was because he was under a lot of stress. 
Also he has been married twice before, and I feel like I‚Äôm stupid because I rushed into it so young. We have been married a little over a year. Sorry for typos, English is not my first language.

1lynxir,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lynxir,AIO to my husband accusing me of having NPD despite psychiatrist disagreeing?,"Sorry for the long screenshots, I also numbered them just in case they posted out of order since sometimes that happens. 

The context is last night, my husband exploded at me calling me a taker and saying i don‚Äôt give him anything and if i just withheld my desires in college, then he would‚Äôve graduated and gotten his degree. that‚Äôs already a long different story that i‚Äôm not gonna get into. 

i listened to him and empathized and asked what he needed from me and how i could help support him better and he said ‚Äúim reading books about narcissists to protect myself from you‚Äù. and i told him im not a narcissist and have even gone to a professional to diagnose me with anything of the sort and she told me i have no traits that would lead her to diagnosing me as narcissistic. my husband claims it‚Äôs not good enough because ‚Äúnarcissists can‚Äôt talk pretty and get out of a diagnosis‚Äù. 

i‚Äôm really tired of trying my hardest to meet his ever changing needs and it‚Äôs never enough, so i ended up telling him im going to bed. he continued spewing cruel insults at me while i tried to sleep and then left to be alone and read his book. 

sundays are our date days and i didn‚Äôt get up with him to go to his church and he texted me and that‚Äôs where the pictures start. he asked me to meet him at a cafe over the phone so i got ready and went over. he was trying to go back to normal but i was clearly still sad and i told him i felt sad and uncomfortable. he asked me what would make me feel better. i said ‚Äúmaybe if you recorded yourself saying im not a narcissist and you see that i do try to care for you well and im not just a taker that would be a good start. because i know this will likely happen again and you wont believe me when i say you already agreed im not a narcissist‚Äù and he got defensive and said ‚Äúwell what even have you done for me recently?‚Äù and i said ‚Äúyou want me to list them?‚Äù and he said yes so i started listing things i do for him or to him or to show care to him and he, one by one, dismissed all of them and went right back into calling me a narcissist. 

so i left. then he texted me more. 

the context for the korea comment is that he was saying ‚Äúmost of america thinks like trump‚Äù because he‚Äôs the president and he won. and i argued that only 33% of qualified voters voted for him which isn‚Äôt majority and that only 23% of all americans in general voted for him, which is also not majority. i agreed that it‚Äôs a shit situation, but i‚Äôm uncomfortable with being told that most of america thinks like trump. and i compared it to the fact that i live in daegu which is more conservative and xenophobic and racist to foreigners and i have experienced those very things while living here, and yet i don‚Äôt go around saying all of korea is xenophobic or racist. so he‚Äôs twisting what i said yesterday, but hopefully you get the context and comparison. 

the context of the slide with the bitch is that there‚Äôs a girl who is very interested in him and i told him a year ago i wasn‚Äôt comfortable with him texting her one on one and he said he wouldn‚Äôt. then he told me last week a story about her and their texting, so i said ‚Äúwait you still text her one on one?‚Äù and he said he forgot about me asking him to not text her one on one. but more than that, it was them fighting over text late at night, and that made me more mad because what kind of relationship do they have to where there would be opportunity for a late night fight? but it was the day before my birthday. i asked him to block her, he said that would be too harsh, so he agreed to just not text her anymore. ps im not worried about cheating, i just feel it‚Äôs disrespectful to have him enable her behavior when she knows he‚Äôs married and still continues to make a move. i just think it‚Äôs the principal. but i accepted his bare minimum apology because i just wanted peace and to not be still fighting on my birthday. 

the reason maybe im overreacting is because had i have just gone to coffee normally with him, we wouldn‚Äôt be fighting right now. so maybe i should‚Äôve just let it go. idk. i‚Äôm really sad. ",0,1752395793.0,AmIOverreacting,42,0.5,False

For my second, I built an app to solve my own coffee vs. sleep problem. [Promo Codes]","I‚Äôm a hobbyist developer and I just finished building my second app. My first project was a huge learning curve, and for my second, I wanted to use what I learned to build something to solve a real problem I deal with every single day.

Simply put: **I love coffee, but it was destroying my sleep.**

So I figured, okay, that‚Äôs what my second app should be. I decided to dive into Core ML and see if I could make a 'smarter' bedtime suggestion that actually acknowledges my coffee habit.

The result is Brew'd Awakening.

It‚Äôs a pretty straightforward app, but here‚Äôs what I tried to focus on:
 * **A calculator that gets it:** This is the main thing. You tell it when you need to wake up, how much sleep you want, and roughly how much coffee you had. It uses a simple on-device model to give you a more realistic bedtime.

 * **Completely private:** This was super important to me. There are no servers and no data collection. Everything happens on your phone and stays there.

 * **The other stuff:** It also has a basic history tracker so you can see your patterns, a page with some sleep tips I found helpful, and light/dark themes to switch up the look. It's all built with SwiftUI.

Building this felt like a big step up from my first project, but I know it‚Äôs not perfect and there‚Äôs always so much room to improve. I would honestly love to hear what you all think. Any feedback‚Äîbrutal or not‚Äîis incredibly valuable as I‚Äôm still learning.

The app is **free to download**, and it has a small ad banner at the bottom. I‚Äôve set up a one-time purchase to remove it if it annoys you.

To say thank you for your time, I have **20 promo codes** for the **ad-free** version. Just drop a comment below with a thought or suggestion, and I‚Äôll DM them out until they‚Äôre gone.

Thanks for checking it out.

1lynv50,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lynv50/sycamore_row_by_john_grisham/,Sycamore Row by John Grisham:,"They found Seth Hubbard in the general area where he had promised to be, though not exactly in the condition expected. He was at the end of a rope, six feet off the ground and twisting slightly in the wind. A front was moving through and Seth was soaked when they found him, not that it mattered. Someone would point out that there was no mud on his shoes and no tracks below him, so therefore he was probably hanging and dead when the rain began. Why was that important? Ultimately, it was not.  
  
¬† The logistics of hanging oneself from a tree are not that simple. Evidently, Seth thought of everything. The rope was three-quarter-inch braided natural Manila, of some age and easily strong enough to handle Seth, who weighed 160 pounds a month earlier at the doctor‚Äôs office. Later, an employee in one of Seth‚Äôs factories would report that he had seen his boss cut the fifty-foot length from a spool a week before using it in such dramatic fashion. One end was tied firmly to a lower branch of the same tree and secured with a slapdash mix of knots and lashings. But, they held. The other end was looped over a higher branch, two feet in girth and exactly twenty-one feet from the ground. From there it fell about nine feet, culminating in a perfect hangman‚Äôs knot, one that Seth had undoubtedly worked on for some time. The noose was straight from the textbook with thirteen coils designed to collapse the loop under pressure. A true hangman‚Äôs knot snaps the neck, making death quicker and less painful, and apparently Seth had done his homework. Other than what was obvious, there was no sign of a struggle or suffering.  
  
¬† A six-foot stepladder had been kicked aside and was lying benignly nearby. Seth had picked his tree, flung his rope, tied it off, climbed the ladder, adjusted the noose, and, when everything was just right, kicked the ladder and fell. His hands were free and dangling near his pockets.  
  
¬† Had there been an instant of doubt, of second-guessing? When his feet left the safety of the ladder, but with his hands still free, had Seth instinctively grabbed the rope above his head and fought desperately until he surrendered? No one would ever know, but it looked doubtful. Later evidence would reveal that Seth had been a man on a mission.  
  
¬† For the occasion, he had selected his finest suit, a thick wool blend, dark gray and usually reserved for funerals in cooler weather. He owned only three. A proper hanging has the effect of stretching the body, so Seth‚Äôs trouser cuffs stopped at his ankles and his jacket stopped at his waist. His black wing tips were polished and spotless. His blue necktie was perfectly knotted. His white shirt, though, was stained with blood that had oozed from under the rope. Within hours, it would be known that Seth Hubbard had attended the 11:00 a. m. worship service at a nearby church. He had spoken to acquaintances, joked with a deacon, placed an offering in the plate, and seemed in reasonably good spirits. Most folks knew Seth was battling lung cancer, though virtually no one knew the doctors had given him a short time to live. Seth was on several prayer lists at the church. However, he carried the stigma of two divorces and would always be tainted as a true Christian.  
  
¬† His suicide would not help matters.  
  
¬† The tree was an ancient sycamore Seth and his family had owned for many years. The land around it was thick with hardwoods, valuable timber Seth had mortgaged repeatedly and parlayed into wealth. His father had acquired the land by dubious means back in the 1930s. Both of Seth‚Äôs ex-wives had tried valiantly to take the land in the divorce wars, but he held on. They got virtually everything else.  
  
¬† First on the scene was Calvin Boggs, a handyman and farm laborer Seth had employed for several years. Early Sunday morning, Calvin had received a call from his boss. ‚ÄúMeet me at the bridge at 2:00 p. m. ,‚Äù Seth said. He didn‚Äôt explain anything and Calvin was not one to ask questions. If Mr. Hubbard said to meet him somewhere at a certain time, then he would be there. At the last minute, Calvin‚Äôs ten-year-old boy begged to tag along, and, against his instincts, Calvin said yes. They followed a gravel road that zigzagged for miles through the Hubbard property. As Calvin drove, he was certainly curious about the meeting. He could not remember another occasion when he met his boss anywhere on a Sunday afternoon. He knew his boss was ill and there were rumors he was dying, but, like everything else, Mr. Hubbard kept it quiet.  
  
¬† The bridge was nothing more than a wooden platform spanning a nameless, narrow creek choked with kudzu and crawling with cottonmouths. For months, Mr. Hubbard had been planning to replace it with a large concrete culvert, but his bad health had sidetracked him. It was near a clearing where two dilapidated shacks rotted in the brush and overgrowth and offered the only hint that there was once a small settlement there.  
  
¬† Parked near the bridge was Mr. Hubbard‚Äôs late-model Cadillac, its driver‚Äôs door open, along with the trunk. Calvin rolled to a stop behind the car and stared at the open trunk and door and felt the first hint that something might be out of place. The rain was steady now and the wind had picked up, and there was no good reason for Mr. Hubbard to leave his door and trunk open. Calvin told his boy to stay in the truck, then slowly walked around the car without touching it. There was no sign of his boss. Calvin took a deep breath, wiped moisture from his face, and looked at the landscape. Beyond the clearing, maybe a hundred yards away, he saw a body hanging from a tree. He returned to his truck, again told the boy to stay inside and keep the doors locked, but it was too late. The boy was staring at the sycamore in the distance.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStay here now,‚Äù Calvin said sternly. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt get out of the truck. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes sir. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Calvin began walking. He took his time as his boots slipped in the mud and his mind tried to stay calm. What was the hurry? The closer he got the clearer things became. The man in the dark suit at the end of the rope was quite dead. Calvin finally recognized him, and he saw the stepladder, and he quickly put the scene and the events in order. Touching nothing, he backed away and returned to his truck.  
  
¬† It was October of 1988, and car phones had finally arrived in rural Mississippi. At Mr. Hubbard‚Äôs insistence, Calvin had one installed in his truck. He called the Ford County sheriff‚Äôs office, gave a brief report, and began waiting. Warmed by the heater and soothed by Merle Haggard on the radio, Calvin gazed through the windshield, ignored the boy, tapped his fingers along with the wipers, and realized he was crying. The boy was afraid to speak.  
  
¬† Two deputies arrived in the same car half an hour later, and as they were putting on rain slickers an ambulance arrived with a crew of three. From the gravel road, they all strained to see the old sycamore, but after a few seconds of focusing it was apparent there was a man hanging from it. Calvin told them everything he knew. The deputies decided it was best to proceed as if a crime had been committed, and they prohibited the ambulance crew from approaching the scene. Another deputy arrived, then another. They searched the car and found nothing helpful. They photographed and videoed Seth hanging with his eyes closed and his head twisted grotesquely to his right. They studied the tracks around the sycamore and found no evidence of anyone else being present. One deputy took Calvin to Mr. Hubbard‚Äôs home a few miles away‚Äîthe boy rode in the backseat, still mute. The doors were unlocked, and on the kitchen table they found a note on a yellow legal pad. Seth had printed neatly: ‚ÄúTo Calvin. Please inform the authorities I‚Äôve taken my own life, with no help from anyone. On the attached sheet of paper I have left specific instructions for my funeral and burial. No autopsy! S. H. ‚Äù It was dated that day, Sunday, October 2, 1988.  
  
¬† Calvin was finally released by the deputies. He hustled the boy home, where he collapsed in his mother‚Äôs arms and said nothing the rest of the day.  
  
¬† Ozzie Walls was one of two black sheriffs in Mississippi. The other had just recently been elected from a county in the Delta that was 70 percent black. Ford County was 74 percent white, but Ozzie had won his election and reelection  
by wide margins. The blacks adored him because he was one of their own. The whites respected him because he was a tough cop and a former football star at Clanton High. In some aspects of life in the Deep South, football was slowly transcending race.  
  
¬† Ozzie was leaving church with his wife and four kids when he got the call. He arrived at the bridge in a suit, no gun or badge, but he did have a pair of old boots in the trunk. Escorted by two of his deputies, he made the walk down to the sycamore in the mud and under an umbrella. Seth‚Äôs body was by now soaked and water dripped from the tips of his shoes, his chin, ears, fingertips, and the cuffs of his pants. Ozzie stopped not far from the shoes, raised his umbrella, and looked at the pallid, pathetic face of a man he‚Äôd met only twice.  
  
¬† There was a history. In 1983, when Ozzie first ran for sheriff, he had three white opponents and no money. He received a call from Seth Hubbard, a stranger to him, and, as Ozzie would learn, a man who kept a low profile. Seth lived in the northeast corner of Ford County, almost on the line with Tyler County. He said he was in the lumber and timber business, owned some sawmills in Alabama, a factory here and there, and gave the appearance of a man who was successful. He offered to bankroll Ozzie‚Äôs campaign, but only if he would accept cash. Twenty-five thousand dollars in cash. In his office, behind a locked door, Seth Hubbard opened a box and showed Ozzie the money. Ozzie explained that campaign contributions must be reported and so on. Seth explained that he did not want his particular contribution to be reported. He wanted a cash deal, or no deal.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat do you want in return?‚Äù Ozzie had asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI want you to be elected. Nothing more,‚Äù Seth had replied.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not so sure about this. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo you think your opponents are taking cash under the table?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúProbably. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course they are. Don‚Äôt be foolish. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Ozzie took the money. He ramped up his campaign, squeaked into the runoff, then stomped his opponent in the general election. Later, he had stopped by Seth‚Äôs office on two occasions to say hello and thanks, but Mr. Hubbard was never there. Mr. Hubbard did not return phone calls. Ozzie quietly quizzed others for information about Mr. Hubbard but little was known. He was rumored to have made money in furniture, but no one knew for sure. He owned two hundred acres of land near his home. He did not use local banks or law firms or insurance agencies. He went to church occasionally.  
  
¬† Four years later Ozzie faced light opposition, but Seth wanted to meet anyway. Twenty-five thousand dollars changed hands again, and again Seth disappeared from view. Now he was dead, killed by his own noose and dripping with rainwater.  
  
¬† Finn Plunkett, the county coroner, finally arrived. The death could now be made official.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get him down,‚Äù Ozzie said. The knots were untied, and with slack in the rope Seth‚Äôs body made its descent. They placed him on a stretcher and covered him with a thermal sheet. Four men labored under the strain as they made their way to the ambulance. Ozzie followed the little procession, as confused as anyone.  
  
¬† He was well into his fifth year on the job and he had seen so many dead bodies. Accidents, car wrecks, a few murders, some suicides. He wasn‚Äôt callous and he wasn‚Äôt jaded. He had made the late-night phone calls to parents and spouses, and he always feared the next one.  
  
¬† Good old Seth. Who, exactly, was Ozzie supposed to call now? He knew Seth was divorced but did not know if he had remarried. He knew nothing about his family. Seth was about seventy. If he had adult children, where were they?

Oh well, Ozzie would find out soon enough. Driving toward Clanton, with the ambulance behind him, he began calling people who might know something about Seth Hubbard.  
  
¬† 2  
  
¬† Jake Brigance stared at the bright red numbers of his digital alarm clock. At 5:29 he reached over, pushed a button, and gently swung his feet out of bed. Carla flipped from one side to the other and burrowed deeper under the covers. Jake patted her rear end and said good morning. There was no response. It was Monday, a workday, and she would sleep for another hour before scurrying from bed and hustling off to school with Hanna. In the summer, Carla would sleep even later and her days were filled with girl stuff and whatever Hanna wanted to do. Jake, though, had a schedule that rarely varied. Up at 5:30; at the Coffee Shop by 6:00; at the office before 7:00. Few people attacked the morning like Jake Brigance, though, now that he had reached the mature age of thirty-five, he asked himself more often why, exactly, did he awaken so early? And why did he insist on arriving at his office before all other lawyers in Clanton? The answers, once so clear, were becoming more obscure. His dream since law school of being a great trial lawyer was not diminished at all; indeed, he was as ambitious as ever. Reality was bugging him. Ten years in the trenches and his office was still filled with wills and deeds and two-bit contract disputes, not one decent criminal case and no promising car wrecks.  
  
¬† His most glorious moment had come and gone. The acquittal of Carl Lee Hailey was three years ago, and Jake sometimes feared he was now beyond his pinnacle. As always, though, he brushed those doubts aside and reminded himself that he was only thirty-five. He was a gladiator with many great courtroom victories before him.  
  
¬† There was no dog to turn out because they‚Äôd lost their dog. Max died in the fire that destroyed their beautiful and beloved and heavily mortgaged Victorian home on Adams Street, three years ago. The Klan had torched the house in the heat of the Hailey trial, July 1985. First they burned a cross in the front yard, then they tried to blow up the house. Jake sent Carla and Hanna away and it was a wise thing to do. After the Klan tried to kill him for a month, they finally burned down his house. He had given his closing argument in a borrowed suit.  
  
¬† The topic of a new dog was too uncomfortable to fully address. They had danced around it a few times, then moved on. Hanna wanted one and probably needed one because she was an only child and often claimed to be bored playing alone. But Jake, and especially Carla, knew who would assume the responsibility of housebreaking and cleaning up after a puppy. Besides, they were living in a rental home with their lives far from settled. Perhaps a dog could bring about some normalcy; perhaps not. Jake often pondered this issue in the early minutes of the day. The truth was he really missed a dog.  
  
¬† After a quick shower, Jake dressed in a small, spare bedroom he and Carla used as a closet to store their clothes. All rooms were small in this flimsy house owned by someone else. Everything was temporary. The furniture was a sad ensemble of giveaways and flea market leftovers, all of which would be tossed one day if things went as planned, though, Jake hated to admit, almost nothing was going his way. Their lawsuit against the insurance company was bogged down in pretrial maneuvering that seemed hopeless. He had filed it six months after the Hailey verdict, when he was on top of the world and bristling with confidence. How dare an insurance company try and screw him? Show him another jury in Ford County and he‚Äôd deliver another great verdict. But the swagger and bluster faded as Jake and Carla slowly realized they had been seriously underinsured. Four blocks away, their vacant and scarred lot was just sitting there, gathering leaves. From next door, Mrs. Pickle kept an eye on it, but there was little to watch. The neighbors were waiting for a fine new home to rise up and for the Brigances to return.  
  
¬† Jake tiptoed into Hanna‚Äôs room, kissed her on the cheek and pulled the sheets up a bit higher. She was seven now, their only child, and there would be no others. She was in the second grade at Clanton Elementary, in a classroom around the corner from where her mother taught kindergartners.  
  
¬† In the narrow kitchen, Jake pushed a button on the coffee brewer and watched the machine until it began making noises. He opened his briefcase, touched the 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol holstered inside, and stuffed in some files. He had grown accustomed to carrying a gun and this saddened him. How could he live a normal life with a weapon nearby at all times? Normal or not, the gun was a necessity. They burn your house after they try to bomb it; they threaten your wife on the phone; they torch a cross in your front yard; they beat your secretary‚Äôs husband senseless and he later dies; they use a sniper to take a shot, but he misses you and hits a guard; they wage terror during the trial and keep up their threats long after it‚Äôs over.  
  
¬† Four of the terrorists were now serving prison sentences‚Äîthree federal, one at Parchman. Only four, Jake reminded himself constantly. There should have been a dozen convictions by now, a feeling shared by Ozzie and other black leaders in the county. Out of habit and out of a sense of frustration, Jake called the FBI at least once a week for updates on their investigation. After three years, his calls were often not returned. He wrote letters. His file filled an entire cabinet in his office.  
  
¬† Only four. He knew the names of many others, all suspects still, in Jake‚Äôs mind anyway. Some had moved and some had stayed, but they were out there, going about their lives as if nothing had happened. So he carried a gun, one with all the proper permits and such. There was one in his briefcase. One in his car. A couple around the office, and several others. His hunting rifles had gone up in the fire, but Jake was slowly rebuilding his collection.  
  
¬† He stepped outside, onto the small brick porch, and filled his lungs with the cool air. On the street, directly in front of the house, there was a Ford County sheriff‚Äôs patrol car, and behind the wheel sat one Louis Tuck, a full-time deputy who worked the graveyard shift and whose primary responsibility was to be seen in the neighborhood throughout the night and, specifically, to be parked near the mailbox at precisely 5:45 each morning, Monday through Saturday, when Mr. Brigance stepped onto the porch and waved hello. Tuck waved back. The Brigances had survived another night.  
  
¬† As long as Ozzie Walls was sheriff of Ford County, which would be at least three more years and probably much longer, he and his office would do whatever possible to protect Jake and his family. Jake had taken Carl Lee Hailey‚Äôs case, worked like a dog for peanuts, dodged bullets, ignored real threats, and lost almost everything before delivering a not-guilty verdict that still resonated in Ford County. Protecting him was Ozzie‚Äôs highest priority.  
  
¬† Tuck eased away. He would circle the block and return in a few minutes after Jake left. He would watch the house until he saw lights in the kitchen and knew Carla was up and moving around.  
  
¬† Jake drove one of two Saabs in Ford County, a red one with 190,000 miles on it. He needed an upgrade but couldn‚Äôt afford one. Such an exotic car in a small town had once been a cool idea, but now the repair costs were brutal. The nearest dealer was in Memphis, an hour away, so every trip to the shop killed half a day and cost a thousand bucks. Jake was ready for an American model, and he thought about this every morning when he turned the ignition key and held his breath as the engine rolled over and came to life. The engine had never failed to start, but in the past few weeks Jake had noticed a delay, an extra turn or two that evoked an ominous warning that something bad was about to happen. Paranoid, he was noticing other noises and rattles, and he was checking the tires every other day as the treads grew thinner. He backed onto Culbert Street, which, though only four blocks from Adams Street and their vacant lot, was clearly in a lesser part of town. The house next door was also a rental. Adams was lined with homes much older and statelier and with more character. Culbert was a hodgepodge of suburban-style boxes thrown up before the city got serious about zoning.  
  
¬† Though she said little, Jake knew Carla was ready to move on, to somewhere.  
  
¬† They had actually talked of moving away, of leaving Clanton altogether. The three  
years since the Hailey trial had been far less prosperous than they had hoped and expected. If Jake was destined to slog through a long career as a struggling lawyer, then why not struggle somewhere else? Carla could teach school anywhere. Surely they could find a good life that did not include weapons and constant vigilance. Jake may have been revered by the blacks in Ford County, but he was still resented by many of the whites. And the crazies were still out there. On the other hand, there was a certain safety living in the midst of so many friends. Their neighbors watched the traffic and a strange car or truck was noted. Every cop in town and every deputy in the county knew the safety of the little Brigance family was of the highest importance.  
  
¬† Jake and Carla would never leave, though it was sometimes amusing to play the old game of where-would-you-like-to-live? It was only a game because Jake knew the brutal truth that he would never fit in a big firm in a big city, nor would he ever find a small town in any state that was not already brimming with hungry lawyers. He was looking clearly at his future, and he was okay with it. He just needed to make a buck.  
  
¬† He drove past the empty lot on Adams, mumbled vile words in condemnation of the cowards who torched his home and managed a few choice ones for the insurance company as well, then sped away. From Adams he turned onto Jefferson, then Washington, which ran east and west along the north side of the Clanton square. His office was on Washington, across from the stately courthouse, and he parked in the same spot each morning at 6:00 a. m. because at that hour there were plenty to choose from. The square would be quiet for two more hours, until the courthouse and the shops and offices around it opened for business.  
  
¬† The Coffee Shop, though, was bustling with blue collars, farmers, and deputies when Jake strolled in and began saying good morning. As always, he was the only one wearing a coat and tie. The white collars gathered an hour later across the square at the Tea Shoppe and discussed interest rates and world politics. At the Coffee Shop they talked football, local politics, and bass fishing. Jake was one of the very few professionals tolerated inside the Coffee Shop. There were several reasons for this: he was well liked, thick-skinned, and good-natured; and, he was always available for a quick legal tip at no charge when one of the mechanics or truck drivers was in a bind. He hung his jacket on the wall and found a seat at a table with Marshall Prather, a deputy. Two days earlier, Ole Miss had lost to Georgia by three touchdowns and this was the hot topic. A gum-smacking, sassy gal named Dell poured his coffee while managing to bump him with her ample ass‚Äîthe same routine six mornings a week. Within minutes she delivered food he never ordered‚Äîwheat toast, grits, and strawberry jelly, the usual. As Jake was shaking Tabasco sauce on the grits, Prather asked, ‚ÄúSay, Jake, did you know Seth Hubbard?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNever met him,‚Äù Jake said, catching a few glances. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard his name once or twice. Had a place up near Palmyra, didn‚Äôt he?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. ‚Äù Prather chewed on a sausage as Jake sipped his coffee.  
  
¬† Jake waited, then said, ‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs safe to assume something bad happened to Seth Hubbard because you put him in the past tense.

¬† The intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the timeas ""The Styles Case"" has now somewhat subsided. Nevertheless, in view ofthe world-wide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked, both bymy friend Poirot and the family themselves, to write an account of thewhole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the sensationalrumours which still persist.  
  
¬† I will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to mybeing connected with the affair.  
  
¬† I had been invalided home from the Front; and, after spending somemonths in a rather depressing Convalescent Home, was given a month'ssick leave. Having no near relations or friends, I was trying to makeup my mind what to do, when I ran across John Cavendish. I had seen verylittle of him for some years. Indeed, I had never known him particularlywell. He was a good fifteen years my senior, for one thing, though hehardly looked his forty-five years. As a boy, though, I had often stayedat Styles, his mother's place in Essex.  
  
¬† We had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me downto Styles to spend my leave there.  
  
¬† ""The mater will be delighted to see you again--after all those years,""he added.  
  
¬† ""Your mother keeps well?"" I asked.  
  
¬† ""Oh, yes. I suppose you know that she has married again?""  
  
¬† I am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly. Mrs. Cavendish, who hadmarried John's father when he was a widower with two sons, had been ahandsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her. She certainly couldnot be a day less than seventy now. I recalled her as an energetic,autocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and socialnotoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the LadyBountiful. She was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerablefortune of her own.  
  
¬† Their country-place, Styles Court, had been purchased by Mr. Cavendishearly in their married life. He had been completely under his wife'sascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for herlifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement thatwas distinctly unfair to his two sons. Their step-mother, however, hadalways been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at thetime of their father's remarriage that they always thought of her astheir own mother.  
  
¬† Lawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. He had qualified as adoctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived athome while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had anymarked success.  
  
¬† John practiced for some time as a barrister, but had finally settleddown to the more congenial life of a country squire. He had marriedtwo years ago, and had taken his wife to live at Styles, though Ientertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his motherto increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a homeof his own. Mrs. Cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make herown plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in thiscase she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.  
  
¬† John noticed my surprise at the news of his mother's remarriage andsmiled rather ruefully.  
  
¬† ""Rotten little bounder too!"" he said savagely. ""I can tell you,Hastings, it's making life jolly difficult for us. As for Evie--youremember Evie?""  
  
¬† ""No.""  
  
¬† ""Oh, I suppose she was after your time. She's the mater's factotum,companion, Jack of all trades! A great sport--old Evie! Not preciselyyoung and beautiful, but as game as they make them.""  
  
¬† ""You were going to say----?""  
  
¬† ""Oh, this fellow! He turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of beinga second cousin or something of Evie's, though she didn't seemparticularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. The fellow is anabsolute outsider, anyone can see that. He's got a great black beard,and wears patent leather boots in all weathers! But the mater cottonedto him at once, took him on as secretary--you know how she's alwaysrunning a hundred societies?""  
  
¬† I nodded.  
  
¬† ""Well, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. Nodoubt the fellow was very useful to her. But you could have knocked usall down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announcedthat she and Alfred were engaged! The fellow must be at least twentyyears younger than she is! It's simply bare-faced fortune hunting; butthere you are--she is her own mistress, and she's married him.""  
  
¬† ""It must be a difficult situation for you all.""  
  
¬† ""Difficult! It's damnable!""  
  
¬† Thus it came about that, three days later, I descended from the train atStyles St. Mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason forexistence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country lanes.John Cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out to thecar.  
  
¬† ""Got a drop or two of petrol still, you see,"" he remarked. ""Mainly owingto the mater's activities.""  
  
¬† The village of Styles St. Mary was situated about two miles from thelittle station, and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it. It wasa still, warm day in early July. As one looked out over the flat Essexcountry, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it seemedalmost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great war wasrunning its appointed course. I felt I had suddenly strayed into anotherworld. As we turned in at the lodge gates, John said:  
  
¬† ""I'm afraid you'll find it very quiet down here, Hastings.""  
  
¬† ""My dear fellow, that's just what I want.""  
  
¬† ""Oh, it's pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. I drillwith the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms. My wifeworks regularly 'on the land'. She is up at five every morning to milk,and keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. It's a jolly good life takingit all round--if it weren't for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp!"" Hechecked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch. ""I wonder if we'vetime to pick up Cynthia. No, she'll have started from the hospital bynow.""  
  
¬† ""Cynthia! That's not your wife?""  
  
¬† ""No, Cynthia is a protegee of my mother's, the daughter of an oldschoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor. He came acropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. My mother cameto the rescue, and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. Sheworks in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster, seven miles away.""  
  
¬† As he spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house.A lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed,straightened herself at our approach.  
  
¬† ""Hullo, Evie, here's our wounded hero! Mr. Hastings--Miss Howard.""  
  
¬† Miss Howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip. I hadan impression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face. She was apleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manlyin its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with feetto match--these last encased in good thick boots. Her conversation, Isoon found, was couched in the telegraphic style.  
  
¬† ""Weeds grow like house afire. Can't keep even with 'em. Shall press youin. Better be careful.""  
  
¬† ""I'm sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful,"" Iresponded.  
  
¬† ""Don't say it. Never does. Wish you hadn't later.""  
  
¬† ""You're a cynic, Evie,"" said John, laughing. ""Where's tea to-day--insideor out?""  
  
¬† ""Out. Too fine a day  
to be cooped up in the house.""  
  
¬† ""Come on then, you've done enough gardening for to-day. 'The labourer isworthy of his hire', you know. Come and be refreshed.""  
  
¬† ""Well,"" said Miss Howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, ""I'minclined to agree with you.""  
  
¬† She led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shadeof a large sycamore.  
  
¬† A figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps tomeet us.  
  
¬† ""My wife, Hastings,"" said John.  
  
¬† I shall never forget my first sight of Mary Cavendish. Her tall, slenderform, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of slumberingfire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful tawny eyesof hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman's that Ihave ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed, whichnevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in anexquisitely civilised body--all these things are burnt into my memory. Ishall never forget them.  
  
¬† She greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clearvoice, and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I hadaccepted John's invitation. Mrs. Cavendish gave me some tea, and herfew quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a thoroughlyfascinating woman. An appreciative listener is always stimulating, andI described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents of my ConvalescentHome, in a way which, I flatter myself, greatly amused my hostess. John,of course, good fellow though he is, could hardly be called a brilliantconversationalist.  
  
¬† At that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open Frenchwindow near at hand:  
  
¬† ""Then you'll write to the Princess after tea, Alfred? I'll write to LadyTadminster for the second day, myself. Or shall we wait until we hearfrom the Princess? In case of a refusal, Lady Tadminster might openit the first day, and Mrs. Crosbie the second. Then there's theDuchess--about the school fete.""  
  
¬† There was the murmur of a man's voice, and then Mrs. Inglethorp's rosein reply:  
  
¬† ""Yes, certainly. After tea will do quite well. You are so thoughtful,Alfred dear.""  
  
¬† The French window swung open a little wider, and a handsome white-hairedold lady, with a somewhat masterful cast of features, stepped out ofit on to the lawn. A man followed her, a suggestion of deference in hismanner.  
  
¬† Mrs. Inglethorp greeted me with effusion.  
  
¬† ""Why, if it isn't too delightful to see you again, Mr. Hastings, afterall these years. Alfred, darling, Mr. Hastings--my husband.""  
  
¬† I looked with some curiosity at ""Alfred darling"". He certainly struck arather alien note. I did not wonder at John objecting to his [beard.It](http://beard.It) was one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen. He woregold-rimmed pince-nez, and had a curious impassivity of feature. Itstruck me that he might look natural on a stage, but was strangely outof place in real life. His voice was rather deep and unctuous. He placeda wooden hand in mine and said:  
  
¬† ""This is a pleasure, Mr. Hastings."" Then, turning to his wife: ""Emilydearest, I think that cushion is a little damp.""  
  
¬† She beamed fondly on him, as he substituted another with everydemonstration of the tenderest care. Strange infatuation of an otherwisesensible woman!  
  
¬† With the presence of Mr. Inglethorp, a sense of constraint and veiledhostility seemed to settle down upon the company. Miss Howard, inparticular, took no pains to conceal her feelings. Mrs. Inglethorp,however, seemed to notice nothing unusual. Her volubility, which Iremembered of old, had lost nothing in the intervening years, and shepoured out a steady flood of conversation, mainly on the subject of theforthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take placeshortly. Occasionally she referred to her husband over a question ofdays or dates. His watchful and attentive manner never varied. From thevery first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and I flatter myselfthat my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd.  
  
¬† Presently Mrs. Inglethorp turned to give some instructions about lettersto Evelyn Howard, and her husband addressed me in his painstaking voice:  
  
¬† ""Is soldiering your regular profession, Mr. Hastings?""  
  
¬† ""No, before the war I was in Lloyd's.""  
  
¬† ""And you will return there after it is over?""  
  
¬† ""Perhaps. Either that or a fresh start altogether.""  
  
¬† Mary Cavendish leant forward.  
  
¬† ""What would you really choose as a profession, if you could just consultyour inclination?""  
  
¬† ""Well, that depends.""  
  
¬† ""No secret hobby?"" she asked. ""Tell me--you're drawn to something? Everyone is--usually something absurd.""  
  
¬† ""You'll laugh at me.""  
  
¬† She smiled.  
  
¬† ""Perhaps.""  
  
¬† ""Well, I've always had a secret hankering to be a detective!""  
  
¬† ""The real thing--Scotland Yard? Or Sherlock Holmes?""  
  
¬† ""Oh, Sherlock Holmes by all means. But really, seriously, I am awfullydrawn to it. I came across a man in Belgium once, a very famousdetective, and he quite inflamed me. He was a marvellous little fellow.He used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of [method.My](http://method.My) system is based on his--though of course I have progressed ratherfurther. He was a funny little man, a great dandy, but wonderfullyclever.""  
  
¬† ""Like a good detective story myself,"" remarked Miss Howard. ""Lots ofnonsense written, though. Criminal discovered in last chapter. Every onedumbfounded. Real crime--you'd know at once.""  
  
¬† ""There have been a great number of undiscovered crimes,"" I argued.  
  
¬† ""Don't mean the police, but the people that are right in it. The [family.You](http://family.You) couldn't really hoodwink them. They'd know.""  
  
¬† ""Then,"" I said, much amused, ""you think that if you were mixed up in acrime, say a murder, you'd be able to spot the murderer right off?""  
  
¬† ""Of course I should. Mightn't be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers.But I'm certain I'd know. I'd feel it in my fingertips if he came nearme.""  
  
¬† ""It might be a 'she,'"" I suggested.  
  
¬† ""Might. But murder's a violent crime. Associate it more with a man.""  
  
¬† ""Not in a case of poisoning."" Mrs. Cavendish's clear voice startledme. ""Dr. Bauerstein was saying yesterday that, owing to the generalignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession,there were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected.""  
  
¬† ""Why, Mary, what a gruesome conversation!"" cried Mrs. Inglethorp. ""Itmakes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave. Oh, there'sCynthia!""  
  
¬† A young girl in V. A. D. uniform ran lightly across the lawn.  
  
¬† ""Why, Cynthia, you are late to-day. This is Mr. Hastings--Miss Murdoch.""  
  
¬† Cynthia Murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life andvigour. She tossed off her little V. A. D. cap, and I admired the greatloose waves of her auburn hair, and the smallness and whiteness of thehand she held out to claim her tea. With dark eyes and eyelashes shewould have been a beauty.  
  
¬† She flung herself down on the ground beside John, and as I handed her aplate of sandwiches she smiled up at me.  
  
¬† ""Sit down here on the grass, do. It's ever so much nicer.""  
  
¬† I dropped down obediently.  
  
¬† ""You work at Tadminster, don't you, Miss Murdoch?""  
  
¬† She nodded.  
  
¬† ""For my sins.""  
  
¬† ""Do they bully you, then?"" I asked, smiling.  
  
¬† ""I should like to see them!"" cried Cynthia with dignity.  
  
¬† ""I have got a cousin who is nursing,"" I remarked. ""And she is terrifiedof 'Sisters'.""  
  
¬† ""I don't wonder. Sisters \_are\_, you know, Mr. Hastings. They simp--ly\_are\_! You've no idea! But I'm not a nurse, thank heaven, I work in thedispensary.""  
  
¬† ""How many people do you poison?"" I asked, smiling.  
  
¬† Cynthia smiled too.  
  
¬† ""Oh, hundreds!"" she said.  
  
¬† ""Cynthia,"" called Mrs. Inglethorp, ""do you think you could write a fewnotes for me?""  
  
¬† ""Certainly, Aunt Emily.""  
  
¬† She jumped up promptly, and something in her manner reminded me thather position was a dependent one, and that Mrs. Inglethorp, kind as shemight be in the main, did not allow her to forget it.  
  
¬† My hostess turned to me.  
  
¬† ""John will show you your room. Supp  
er is at half-past seven. We havegiven up late dinner for some time now. Lady Tadminster, our Member'swife--she was the late Lord Abbotsbury's daughter--does the same. Sheagrees with me that one must set an example of economy. We are quite awar household; nothing is wasted here--every scrap of waste paper, even,is saved and sent away in sacks.""  
  
¬† I expressed my appreciation, and John took me into the house and up thebroad staircase, which forked right and left half-way to different wingsof the building. My room was in the left wing, and looked out over thepark.  
  
¬† John left me, and a few minutes later I saw him from my window walkingslowly across the grass arm in arm with Cynthia Murdoch. I heard Mrs.Inglethorp call ""Cynthia"" impatiently, and the girl started and ran backto the house. At the same moment, a man stepped out from the shadow ofa tree and walked slowly in the same direction. He looked about forty,very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face. Some violent emotionseemed to be mastering him. He looked up at my window as he passed, andI recognized him, though he had changed much in the fifteen years thathad elapsed since we last met. It was John's younger brother, LawrenceCavendish. I wondered what it was that had brought that singularexpression to his face.  
  
¬† Then I dismissed him from my mind, and returned to the contemplation ofmy own affairs.  
  
¬† The evening passed pleasantly enough; and I dreamed that night of thatenigmatical woman, Mary Cavendish.  
  
¬† The next morning dawned bright and sunny, and I was full of theanticipation of a delightful visit.  
  
¬† I did not see Mrs. Cavendish until lunch-time, when she volunteered totake me for a walk, and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in thewoods, returning to the house about five.  
  
¬† As we entered the large hall, John beckoned us both into thesmoking-room. I saw at once by his face that something disturbing hadoccurred. We followed him in, and he shut the door after us.  
  
¬† ""Look here, Mary, there's the deuce of a mess. Evie's had a row withAlfred Inglethorp, and she's off.""  
  
¬† ""Evie? Off?""  
  
¬† John nodded gloomily.  
  
¬† ""Yes; you see she went to the mater, and--Oh, here's Evie herself.""  
  
¬† Miss Howard entered. Her lips were set grimly together, and she carrieda small suit-case. She looked excited and determined, and slightly onthe defensive.  
  
¬† ""At any rate,"" she burst out, ""I've spoken my mind!""  
  
¬† ""My dear Evelyn,"" cried Mrs. Cavendish, ""this can't be true!""  
  
¬† Miss Howard nodded grimly.  
  
¬† ""True enough! Afraid I said some things to Emily she won't forget orforgive in a hurry. Don't mind if they've only sunk in a bit. Probablywater off a duck's back, though. I said right out: 'You're an old woman,Emily, and there's no fool like an old fool. The man's twenty yearsyounger than you, and don't you fool yourself as to what he married youfor. Money! Well, don't let him have too much of it. Farmer Raikes hasgot a very pretty young wife. Just ask your Alfred how much time hespends over there.' She was very angry. Natural! I went on, 'I'm goingto warn you, whether you like it or not. That man would as soon murderyou in your bed as look at you. He's a bad lot. You can say what youlike to me, but remember what I've told you. He's a bad lot!'""  
  
¬† ""What did she say?""  
  
¬† Miss Howard made an extremely expressive grimace.  
  
¬† ""'Darling Alfred'--'dearest Alfred'--'wicked calumnies'--'wickedlies'--'wicked woman'--to accuse her 'dear husband'! The sooner I lefther house the better. So I'm off.""  
  
¬† ""But not now?""  
  
¬† ""This minute!""  
  
¬† For a moment we sat and stared at her. Finally John Cavendish, findinghis persuasions of no avail, went off to look up the trains. His wifefollowed him, murmuring something about persuading Mrs. Inglethorp tothink better of it.  
  
¬† As she left the room, Miss Howard's face changed. She leant towards meeagerly.  
  
¬† ""Mr. Hastings, you're honest. I can trust you?""  
  
¬† I was a little startled. She laid her hand on my arm, and sank her voiceto a whisper.  
  
¬† ""Look after her, Mr. Hastings. My poor Emily. They're a lot ofsharks--all of them. Oh, I know what I'm talking about. There isn'tone of them that's not hard up and trying to get money out of her. I'veprotected her as much as I could. Now I'm out of the way, they'll imposeupon her.""  
  
¬† ""Of course, Miss Howard,"" I said, ""I'll do everything I can, but I'msure you're excited and overwrought.""  
  
¬† She interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger.  
  
¬† ""Young man, trust me. I've lived in the world rather longer than youhave. All I ask you is to keep your eyes open. You'll see what I mean.""  
  
¬† The throb of the motor came through the open window, and Miss Howardrose and moved to the door. John's voice sounded outside. With her handon the handle, she turned her head over her shoulder, and beckoned tome.  
  
¬† ""Above all, Mr. Hastings, watch that devil--her husband!""  
  
¬† There was no time for more. Miss Howard was swallowed up in an eagerchorus of protests and good-byes. The Inglethorps did not appear.  
  
¬† As the motor drove away, Mrs. Cavendish suddenly detached herself fromthe group, and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall beardedman who had been evidently making for the house. The colour rose in hercheeks as she held out her hand to him.  
  
¬† ""Who is that?"" I asked sharply, for instinctively I distrusted the man.  
  
¬† ""That's Dr. Bauerstein,"" said John shortly.  
  
¬† ""And who is Dr. Bauerstein?""  
  
¬† ""He's staying in the village doing a rest cure, after a bad nervousbreakdown. He's a London specialist; a very clever man--one of thegreatest living experts on poisons, I believe.""  
  
¬† ""And he's a great friend of Mary's,"" put in Cynthia, the irrepressible.  
  
¬† John Cavendish frowned and changed the subject.  
  
¬† ""Come for a stroll, Hastings. This has been a most rotten business. Shealways had a rough tongue, but there is no stauncher friend in Englandthan Evelyn Howard.""  
  
¬† He took the path through the plantation, and we walked down to thevillage through the woods which bordered one side of the estate.  
  
¬† As we passed through one of the gates on our way home again, a prettyyoung woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed andsmiled.  
  
¬† ""That's a pretty girl,"" I remarked appreciatively.  
  
¬† John's face hardened.  
  
¬† ""That is Mrs. Raikes.""  
  
¬† ""The one that Miss Howard----""  
  
¬† ""Exactly,"" said John, with rather unnecessary abruptness.  
  
¬† I thought of the white-haired old lady in the big house, and that vividwicked little face that had just smiled into ours, and a vague chill offoreboding crept over me. I brushed it aside.  
  
¬† ""Styles is really a glorious old place,"" I said to John.  
  
¬† He nodded rather gloomily.  
  
¬† ""Yes, it's a fine property. It'll be mine some day--should be minenow by rights, if my father had only made a decent will. And then Ishouldn't be so damned hard up as I am now.""  
  
¬† ""Hard up, are you?""  
  
¬† ""My dear Hastings, I don't mind telling you that I'm at my wits' end formoney.""  
  
¬† ""Couldn't your brother help you?""  
  
¬† ""Lawrence? He's gone through every penny he ever had, publishing rottenverses in fancy bindings. No, we're an impecunious lot. My mother'salways been awfully good to us, I must say. That is, up to now. Sinceher marriage, of course----"" he broke off, frowning.  
  
¬† For the first time I felt that, with Evelyn Howard, somethingindefinable had gone from the atmosphere. Her presence had speltsecurity. Now that security was removed--and the air seemed rifewith suspicion. The sinister face of Dr. Bauerstein recurred to meunpleasantly. A vague suspicion of every one and everything filled mymind. Just for a moment I had a premonition of approaching evil.

¬†CHAPTER II. THE 16TH AND 17TH OF JULY  
  
¬† I had arrived at Styles on the 5th of July. I come now to the eventsof the 16th and 17th of that month. For the convenience of the readerI will recapitulate the incidents of those days in as exact a manner aspossible. They were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process oflong and tedious cross-examinations.  
  
¬† I received a letter from Evelyn Howard a couple of days after herdeparture, telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital inMiddlingham, a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away, and beggingme to let her know if Mrs. Inglethorp should show any wish to bereconciled.  
  
¬† The only fly in the ointment of my peaceful days was Mrs. Cavendish'sextraordinary, and, for my part, unaccountable preference for thesociety of Dr. Bauerstein. What she saw in the man I cannot imagine, butshe was always asking him up to the house, and often went off for longexpeditions with him. I must confess that I was quite unable to see hisattraction.  
  
¬† The 16th of July fell on a Monday. It was a day of turmoil. The famousbazaar had taken place on Saturday, and an entertainment, in connectionwith the same charity, at which Mrs. Inglethorp was to recite a Warpoem, was to be held that night. We were all busy during the morningarranging and decorating the Hall in the village where it was to takeplace. We had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in thegarden. I noticed that John's manner was somewhat unusual. He seemedvery excited and restless.  
  
¬† After tea, Mrs. Inglethorp went to lie down to rest before her effortsin the evening and I challenged Mary Cavendish to a single at tennis.  
  
¬† About a quarter to seven, Mrs. Inglethorp called us that we should belate as supper was early that night. We had rather a scramble to getready in time; and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at thedoor.  
  
¬† The entertainment was a great success, Mrs. Inglethorp's recitationreceiving tremendous applause. There were also some tableaux in whichCynthia took part. She did not return with us, having been asked to asupper party, and to remain the night with some friends who had beenacting with her in the tableaux.  
  
¬† The following morning, Mrs. Inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast, asshe was rather overtired; but she appeared in her briskest mood about12.30, and swept Lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party.  
  
¬† ""Such a charming invitation from Mrs. Rolleston. Lady Tadminster'ssister, you know. The Rollestons came over with the Conqueror--one ofour oldest families.""  
  
¬† Mary had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with Dr.Bauerstein.  
  
¬† We had a pleasant luncheon, and as we drove away Lawrence suggested thatwe should return by Tadminster, which was barely a mile out of our way,and pay a visit to Cynthia in her dispensary. Mrs. Inglethorp repliedthat this was an excellent idea, but as she had several letters to writeshe would drop us there, and we could come back with Cynthia in thepony-trap.  
  
¬† We were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter, until Cynthiaappeared to vouch for us, looking very cool and sweet in her long whiteoverall. She took us up to her sanctum, and introduced us to her fellowdispenser, a rather awe-inspiring individual, whom Cynthia cheerilyaddressed as ""Nibs.""  
  
¬† ""What a lot of bottles!"" I exclaimed, as my eye travelled round thesmall room. ""Do you really know what's in them all?""  
  
¬† ""Say something original,"" groaned Cynthia. ""Every single person whocomes up here says that. We are really thinking of bestowing a prize onthe first individual who does \_not\_ say: 'What a lot of bottles!' AndI know the next thing you're going to say is: 'How many people have youpoisoned?'""  
  
¬† I pleaded guilty with a laugh.  
  
¬† ""If you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone bymistake, you wouldn't joke about it. Come on, let's have tea. We've gotall sorts of secret stories in that cupboard. No, Lawrence--that's thepoison cupboard. The big cupboard--that's right.""  
  
¬† We had a very cheery tea, and assisted Cynthia to wash up afterwards. Wehad just put away the last tea-spoon when a knock came at the door. Thecountenances of Cynthia and Nibs were suddenly petrified into a sternand forbidding expression.  
  
¬† ""Come in,"" said Cynthia, in a sharp professional tone.  
  
¬† A young and rather scared looking nurse appeared with a bottle whichshe proffered to Nibs, who waved her towards Cynthia with the somewhatenigmatical remark:  
  
¬† ""\_I\_'m not really here to-day.""  
  
¬† Cynthia took the bottle and examined it with the severity of a judge.  
  
¬† ""This should have been sent up this morning.""  
  
¬† ""Sister is very sorry. She forgot.""  
  
¬† ""Sister should read the rules outside the door.""  
  
¬† I gathered from the little nurse's expression that there was not theleast likelihood of her having the hardihood to retail this message tothe dreaded ""Sister"".  
  
¬† ""So now it can't be done until to-morrow,"" finished Cynthia.  
  
¬† ""Don't you think you could possibly let us have it to-night?""  
  
¬† ""Well,"" said Cynthia graciously, ""we are very busy, but if we have timeit shall be done.""  
  
¬† The little nurse withdrew, and Cynthia promptly took a jar from theshelf, refilled the bottle, and placed it on the table outside the door.  
  
¬† I laughed.  
  
¬† ""Discipline must be maintained?""  
  
¬† ""Exactly. Come out on our little balcony. You can see all the outsidewards there.""  
  
¬† I followed Cynthia and her friend and they pointed out the differentwards to me. Lawrence remained behind, but after a few moments Cynthiacalled to him over her shoulder to come and join us. Then she looked ather watch.  
  
¬† ""Nothing more to do, Nibs?""  
  
¬† ""No.""  
  
¬† ""All right. Then we can lock up and go.""  
  
¬† I had seen Lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon. Comparedto John, he was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know. He wasthe opposite of his brother in almost every respect, being unusually shyand reserved. Yet he had a certain charm of manner, and I fancied that,if one really knew him well, one could have a deep affection for him.I had always fancied that his manner to Cynthia was rather constrained,and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him. But they wereboth gay enough this afternoon, and chatted together like a couple ofchildren.  
  
¬† As we drove through the village, I remembered that I wanted some stamps,so accordingly we pulled up at the post office.  
  
¬† As I came out again, I cannoned into a little man who was just entering.I drew aside and apologised, when suddenly, with a loud exclamation, heclasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly.  
  
¬† ""\_Mon ami\_ Hastings!"" he cried. ""It is indeed \_mon ami\_ Hastings!""  
  
¬† ""Poirot!"" I exclaimed.  
  
¬† I turned to the pony-trap.  
  
¬† ""This is a very pleasant meeting for me, Miss Cynthia. This is my oldfriend, Monsieur Poirot, whom I have not seen for years.""  
  
¬† ""Oh, we know Monsieur Poirot,"" said Cynthia gaily. ""But I had no idea hewas a friend of yours.""  
  
¬† ""Yes, indeed,"" said Poirot seriously. ""I know Mademoiselle Cynthia. Itis by the charity of that good Mrs. Inglethorp that I am here."" Then,as I looked at him inquiringly: ""Yes, my friend, she had kindly extendedhospitality to seven of my countrypeople who, alas, are refugees fromtheir native land. We Belgians will always remember her with gratitude.""  
  
¬† Poirot was an extraordinary looking little man. He was hardly more thanfive feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity. His headwas exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little onone side. His moustache was very stiff and military. The neatness ofhis attire was almost incredible. I believe a speck of dust would havecaused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandifiedlittle man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in histime one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police. Asa detective, his flair had been extraordinary, and he had achievedtriumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day.  
  
¬† He pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellowBelgians, and I promised to go and see him at an early date. Then heraised his hat with a flourish to Cynthia, and we drove away.  
  
¬† ""He's a dear little man,"" said Cyn  
thia. ""I'd no idea you knew him.""  
  
¬† ""You've been entertaining a celebrity unawares,"" I replied.  
  
¬† And, for the rest of the way home, I recited to them the variousexploits and triumphs of Hercule Poirot.  
  
¬† We arrived back in a very cheerful mood. As we entered the hall, Mrs.Inglethorp came out of her boudoir. She looked flushed and upset.  
  
¬† ""Oh, it's you,"" she said.  
  
¬† ""Is there anything the matter, Aunt Emily?"" asked Cynthia.  
  
¬† ""Certainly not,"" said Mrs. Inglethorp sharply. ""What should therebe?"" Then catching sight of Dorcas, the parlourmaid, going into thedining-room, she called to her to bring some stamps into the boudoir.  
  
¬† ""Yes, m'm."" The old servant hesitated, then added diffidently: ""Don'tyou think, m'm, you'd better get to bed? You're looking very tired.""  
  
¬† ""Perhaps you're right, Dorcas--yes--no--not now. I've some letters Imust finish by post-time. Have you lighted the fire in my room as I toldyou?""  
  
¬† ""Yes, m'm.""  
  
¬† ""Then I'll go to bed directly after supper.""  
  
¬† She went into the boudoir again, and Cynthia stared after her.  
  
¬† ""Goodness gracious! I wonder what's up?"" she said to Lawrence.  
  
¬† He did not seem to have heard her, for without a word he turned on hisheel and went out of the house.  
  
¬† I suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and, Cynthia agreeing,I ran upstairs to fetch my racquet.  
  
¬† Mrs. Cavendish was coming down the stairs. It may have been my fancy,but she, too, was looking odd and disturbed.  
  
¬† ""Had a good walk with Dr. Bauerstein?"" I asked, trying to appear asindifferent as I could.  
  
¬† ""I didn't go,"" she replied abruptly. ""Where is Mrs. Inglethorp?""  
  
¬† ""In the boudoir.""  
  
¬† Her hand clenched itself on the banisters, then she seemed to nerveherself for some encounter, and went rapidly past me down the stairsacross the hall to the boudoir, the door of which she shut behind her.  
  
¬† As I ran out to the tennis court a few moments later, I had to pass theopen boudoir window, and was unable to help overhearing the followingscrap of dialogue. Mary Cavendish was saying in the voice of a womandesperately controlling herself:  
  
¬† ""Then you won't show it to me?""  
  
¬† To which Mrs. Inglethorp replied:  
  
¬† ""My dear Mary, it has nothing to do with that matter.""  
  
¬† ""Then show it to me.""  
  
¬† ""I tell you it is not what you imagine. It does not concern you in theleast.""  
  
¬† To which Mary Cavendish replied, with a rising bitterness:  
  
¬† ""Of course, I might have known you would shield him.""  
  
¬† Cynthia was waiting for me, and greeted me eagerly with:  
  
¬† ""I say! There's been the most awful row! I've got it all out of Dorcas.""  
  
¬† ""What kind of a row?""  
  
¬† ""Between Aunt Emily and \_him\_. I do hope she's found him out at last!""  
  
¬† ""Was Dorcas there, then?""  
  
¬† ""Of course not. She 'happened to be near the door'. It was a real oldbust-up. I do wish I knew what it was all about.""  
  
¬† I thought of Mrs. Raikes's gipsy face, and Evelyn Howard's warnings, butwisely decided to hold my peace, whilst Cynthia exhausted every possiblehypothesis, and cheerfully hoped, ""Aunt Emily will send him away, andwill never speak to him again.""  
  
¬† I was anxious to get hold of John, but he was nowhere to be seen.Evidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon. I triedto forget the few words I had overheard; but, do what I would, I couldnot dismiss them altogether from my mind. What was Mary Cavendish'sconcern in the matter?  
  
¬† Mr. Inglethorp was in the drawing-room when I came down to supper. Hisface was impassive as ever, and the strange unreality of the man struckme afresh.  
  
¬† Mrs. Inglethorp came down last. She still looked agitated, and duringthe meal there was a somewhat constrained silence. Inglethorp wasunusually quiet. As a rule, he surrounded his wife with littleattentions, placing a cushion at her back, and altogether playing thepart of the devoted husband. Immediately after supper, Mrs. Inglethorpretired to her boudoir again.  
  
¬† ""Send my coffee in here, Mary,"" she called. ""I've just five minutes tocatch the post.""  
  
¬† Cynthia and I went and sat by the open window in the drawing-room. MaryCavendish brought our coffee to us. She seemed excited.  
  
¬† ""Do you young people want lights, or do you enjoy the twilight?"" sheasked. ""Will you take Mrs. Inglethorp her coffee, Cynthia? I will pourit out.""  
  
¬† ""Do not trouble, Mary,"" said Inglethorp. ""I will take it to Emily."" Hepoured it out, and went out of the room carrying it carefully.  
  
¬† Lawrence followed him, and Mrs. Cavendish sat down by us.  
  
¬† We three sat for some time in silence. It was a glorious night, hot andstill. Mrs. Cavendish fanned herself gently with a palm leaf.  
  
¬† ""It's almost too hot,"" she murmured. ""We shall have a thunderstorm.""  
  
¬† Alas, that these harmonious moments can never endure! My paradise wasrudely shattered by the sound of a well known, and heartily disliked,voice in the hall.  
  
¬† ""Dr. Bauerstein!"" exclaimed Cynthia. ""What a funny time to come.""  
  
¬† I glanced jealously at Mary Cavendish, but she seemed quite undisturbed,the delicate pallor of her cheeks did not vary.  
  
¬† In a few moments, Alfred Inglethorp had ushered the doctor in, thelatter laughing, and protesting that he was in no fit state for adrawing-room. In truth, he presented a sorry spectacle, being literallyplastered with mud.  
  
¬† ""What have you been doing, doctor?"" cried Mrs. Cavendish.  
  
¬† ""I must make my apologies,"" said the doctor. ""I did not really mean tocome in, but Mr. Inglethorp insisted.""  
  
¬† ""Well, Bauerstein, you are in a plight,"" said John, strolling in fromthe hall. ""Have some coffee, and tell us what you have been up to.""  
  
¬† ""Thank you, I will."" He laughed rather ruefully, as he described how hehad discovered a very rare species of fern in an inaccessible place,and in his efforts to obtain it had lost his footing, and slippedignominiously into a neighbouring pond.  
  
¬† ""The sun soon dried me off,"" he added, ""but I'm afraid my appearance isvery disreputable.""  
  
¬† At this juncture, Mrs. Inglethorp called to Cynthia from the hall, andthe girl ran out.  
  
¬† ""Just carry up my despatch-case, will you, dear? I'm going to bed.""  
  
¬† The door into the hall was a wide one. I had risen when Cynthia did,John was close by me. There were therefore three witnesses who couldswear that Mrs. Inglethorp was carrying her coffee, as yet untasted, inher hand.  
  
¬† My evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of Dr.Bauerstein. It seemed to me the man would never go. He rose at last,however, and I breathed a sigh of relief.  
  
¬† ""I'll walk down to the village with you,"" said Mr. Inglethorp. ""I mustsee our agent over those estate accounts."" He turned to John. ""No oneneed sit up. I will take the latch-key.

When I am on it daily, people in my life notice how much better my mood is. 

I recently had to get off it for a while to take some tests and holy shit could I tell a difference. 

Much less energy, was more reactive to foods, etc etc.

While I was off, I ended up in an anaphylactic state, contemplating going to the hospital, but I decided to take a cimetidine and within an hour, I was completely fine. It was like the anaphylaxis never happened. 

I am now back to taking it every morning, and I almost get this boost of euphoria from it. It works better for my energy levels than when I was drinking coffee. 

If anyone hasn‚Äôt tried it, I would suggest it. Even if you don‚Äôt want to take it every day, if you ever go off your low histamine diet, it works great for a once in a while emergency med to stave off high histamine meals. It works better than DAO for me.

 I tried taking Pepcid in the past and it destroyed my stomach. Am so glad I found cimetidine! ",3,1752395377.0,MCAS,2,1.0,False

1lynsg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lynsg5/a_time_to_kill_by_john_grisham/,A Time to Kill by John Grisham:,"Chapter One  
  
¬† Billy Ray Cobb was the younger and smaller of the two rednecks. At twenty-three he was already a three-year veteran of the state penitentiary at Parchman. Possession, with intent to sell. He was a lean, tough little punk who had survived prison by somehow maintaining a ready supply of drugs that he sold and sometimes gave to the blacks and the guards for protection. In the year since his release he had continued to prosper, and his small-time narcotics business had elevated him to the position of one of the more affluent rednecks in Ford County. He was a businessman, with employees, obligations, deals, everything but taxes. Down at the Ford place in Clanton he was known as the last man in recent history to pay cash for a new pickup truck. Sixteen thousand cash, for a custom-built, four-wheel drive, canary yellow, luxury Ford pickup. The fancy chrome wheels and mudgrip racing tires had been received in a business deal. The rebel flag hanging across the rear window had been stolen by Cobb from a drunken fraternity boy at an Ole Miss football game. The pickup was Billy Ray's most prized possession. He sat on the tailgate drinking a beer, smoking a joint, watching his friend Willard take his turn with the black girl.  
  
¬† Willard was four years older and a dozen years slower. He was generally a harmless sort who had never been in serious trouble and had never been seriously employed. Maybe an occasional fight with a night in jail, but nothing that would distinguish him. He called himself a pulpwood cutter, but a bad back customarily kept him out of the woods. He had hurt his back working on an offshore rig somewhere in the Gulf, and the oil company paid him a nice settlement, which he lost when his ex-wife cleaned him out. His primary vocation was that of a part-time employee of Billy Ray Cobb, who didn't pay much but was liberal with his dope. For the first time in years Willard could always get his hands on something. And he always needed something. He'd been that way since he hurt his back.  
  
¬† She was ten, and small for her age. She lay on her elbows, which were stuck and bound together with yellow nylon rope. Her legs were spread grotesquely with the right foot tied tight to an oak sapling and the left to a rotting, leaning post of a long-neglected fence. The ski rope had cut into her ankles and the blood ran down her legs. Her face was bloody and swollen, with one eye bulging and closed and the other eye half open so she could see the other white man sitting on the truck. She did not look at the man on top of her. He was breathing hard and sweating and cursing. He was hurting her.  
  
¬† When he finished, he slapped her and laughed, and the other man laughed in return, then they laughed harder and rolled around the grass by the truck like two crazy men, screaming and laughing. She turned away from them and cried softly, careful to keep herself quiet. She had been slapped earlier for crying and screaming. They promised to kill her if she didn't keep quiet.  
  
¬† They grew tired of laughing and pulled themselves onto the tailgate, where Willard cleaned himself with the little nigger's shirt, which by now was soaked with blood and sweat. Cobb handed him a cold beer from the cooler and commented on the humidity. They watched her as she sobbed and made strange, quiet sounds, then became still. Cobb's beer was half empty, and it was not cold anymore. He threw it at the girl. It hit her in the stomach, splashing white foam, and it rolled off in the dirt near some other cans, all of which had originated from the same cooler. For two six-packs now they had thrown their half-empty cans at her and laughed. Willard had trouble with the target, but Cobb was fairly accurate. They were not ones to waste beer, but the heavier cans could be felt better and it was great fun to watch the foam shoot everywhere.  
  
¬† The warm beer mixed with the dark blood and ran down her face and neck into a puddle behind her head. She did not move.  
  
¬† Willard asked Cobb if he thought she was dead. Cobb opened another beer and explained that she was not dead because niggers generally could not be killed by kicking and beating and raping. It took much more, something like a knife or a gun or a rope to dispose of a nigger. Although he had never taken part in such a killing, he had lived with a bunch of niggers in prison and knew all about them. They were always killing each other, and they always used a weapon of some sort. Those who were just beaten and raped never died. Some of the whites were beaten and raped, and some of them died. But none of the niggers. Their heads were harder. Willard seemed satisfied.  
  
¬† Willard asked what he planned to do now that they were through with her. Cobb sucked on his joint, chased it with beer, and said he wasn't through. He bounced from the tailgate and staggered across the small clearing to where she was tied. He cursed her and screamed at her to wake up, then he poured cold beer in her face, laughing like a crazy man.  
  
¬† She watched him as he walked around the tree on her right side, and she stared at him as he stared between her legs. When he lowered his pants she turned to the left and closed her eyes. He was hurting her again.  
  
¬† She looked out through the woods and saw something -a man running wildly through the vines and underbrush. It was her daddy, yelling and pointing at her and coming desperately to save her. She cried out for him, and he disappeared. She fell asleep.  
  
¬† When she awoke one of the men was lying under the tailgate, the other under a tree. They were asleep. Her arms and legs were numb. The blood and beer and urine had mixed with the dirt underneath her to form a sticky paste that glued her small body to the ground and crackled when she moved and wiggled. Escape, she thought, but her mightiest efforts moved her only a few inches to the right. Her feet were tied so high her buttocks barely touched the ground. Her legs and arms were so deadened they refused to move.  
  
¬† She searched the woods for her daddy and quietly called his name. She waited, then slept again.  
  
¬† When she awoke the second time they were up and moving around. The tall one staggered to her with a small knife. He grabbed her left ankle and sawed furiously on the rope until it gave way. Then he freed the right leg, and she curled into a fetal position with her back to them.  
  
¬† Cobb strung a length of quarter-inch ski rope over a limb and tied a loop in one end with a slip knot. He grabbed her and put the noose around her head, then walked across the clearing with the other end of the rope and sat on the tailgate, where Willard was smoking a fresh joint and grinning at Cobb for what he was about to do. Cobb pulled the rope tight, then gave a vicious yank, bouncing the little nude body along the ground and stopping it directly under the limb. She gagged and coughed, so he kindly loosened the rope to spare her a few more minutes. He tied the rope to the bumper and opened another beer.  
  
¬† They sat on the tailgate drinking, smoking, and staring at her. They had been at the lake most of the day, where Cobb had a friend with a boat and some extra girls who were supposed to be easy but turned out to be untouchable. Cobb had been generous with his drugs and beer, but the girls did not reciprocate. Frustrated, they left the lake and were driving to no place in particular when they happened across the girl. She was walking along a gravel road with a sack of groceries when Willard nailed her in the back of the head with a beer can.  
  
¬† ""You gonna do it?"" asked Willard, his eyes red and glazed.  
  
¬† Cobb hesitated. ""Naw, I'll let you do it. It was your idea. ""  
  
¬† Willard took a drag on his joint, then spit and said, ""Wasn't my idea. You're the expert on killin' niggers. Do it. ""  
  
¬† Cobb untied the rope from the bumper and pulled it tight. It peeled bark from the limb and sprinkled fine bits of elm around the girl, who was watching them carefully now. She coughed.  
  
¬† Suddenly, she heard something-like a car with loud pipes. The two men turned quickly and looked down the dirt road to the highway in the distance. They cursed and scrambled around, one slamming the tailgate and the other running toward her. He tripped and landed near her. They cursed each other while they grabbed her, removed the rope from her neck, dragged her to the pickup and threw her  
over the tailgate into the bed of the truck. Cobb slapped her and threatened to kill her if she did not lie still and keep quiet. He said he would take her home if she stayed down and did as told; otherwise, they would kill her. They slammed the doors and sped onto the dirt road. She was going home. She passed out.  
  
¬† Cobb and Willard waved at the Firebird with the loud pipes as it passed them on the narrow dirt road. Willard checked the back to make sure the little nigger was lying down. Cobb turned onto the highway and raced away.  
  
¬† ""What now?"" Willard asked nervously.  
  
¬† ""Don't know,"" Cobb answered nervously. ""But we gotta do something fast before she gets blood all over my truck. Look at her back there, she's bleedin' all over the place. ""  
  
¬† Willard thought for a minute while he finished a beer. ""Let's throw her off a bridge,"" he said proudly.  
  
¬† ""Good idea. Damned good idea. "" Cobb slammed on the brakes. ""Gimme a beer,"" he ordered Willard, who stumbled out of the truck and fetched two beers from the back.  
  
¬† ""She's even got blood on the cooler,"" he reported as they raced off again.  
  
¬† Gwen Hailey sensed something horrible. Normally she would have sent one of the three boys to the store, but they were being punished by their father and had been sentenced to weed-pulling in the garden. Tonya had been to the store before by herself-it was only a mile away-and had proven reliable. But after two hours Gwen sent the boys to look for their little sister. They figured she was down at the Pounders' house playing with the many Pounders kids, or maybe she had ventured past the store to visit her best friend, Bessie Pierson.  
  
¬† Mr. Bates at the store said she had come and gone an hour earlier. Jarvis, the middle boy, found a sack of groceries beside the road.  
  
¬† Gwen called her husband at the paper mill, then loaded Carl Lee, Jr. , into the car and began driving the gravel roads around the store. They drove to a settlement of ancient shotgun houses on Graham Plantation to check with an aunt. They stopped at Broadway's store a mile from Bates Grocery and were told by a group of old black men that she had not been seen. They crisscrossed the gravel roads and dusty field roads for three square miles around their house.  
  
¬† Cobb could not find a bridge unoccupied by niggers with fishing poles. Every bridge they approached had four or five niggers hanging off the sides with large straw hats and cane poles, and under every bridge on the banks there would be another group sitting on buckets with the same straw hats and cane poles, motionless except for an occasional swat at a fly or a slap at a mosquito.  
  
¬† He was scared now. Willard had passed out and was of no help, and he was left alone to dispose of the girl in such a way that she could never tell. Willard snored as he frantically drove the gravel roads and county roads in search of a bridge or ramp on some river where he could stop and toss her without being seen by half a dozen niggers with straw hats. He looked in the mirror and saw her trying to stand. He slammed his brakes, and she crashed into the front of the bed, just under the window. Willard ricocheted off the dash into the floorboard, where he continued to snore. Cobb cursed them both equally.  
  
¬† Lake Chatulla was nothing more than a huge, shallow, man-made mudhole with a grass-covered dam running exactly one mile along one end. It sat in the far southwest corner of Ford County, with a few acres in Van Buren County. In the spring it would hold the distinction of being the largest body of water in Mississippi. But by late summer the rains were long gone, and the sun would cook the shallow water until the lake would dehydrate. Its once ambitious shorelines would retreat and move much closer together, creating a depthless basin of reddish brown water. It was fed from all directions by innumerable streams, creeks, sloughs, and a couple of currents large enough to be named rivers. The existence of all these tributaries necessarily gave rise to a good number of bridges near the lake.  
  
¬† It was over these bridges the yellow pickup flew in an all-out effort to find a suitable place to unload an unwanted passenger. Cobb was desperate. He knew of one other bridge, a narrow wooden one over Foggy Creek. As he approached, he saw niggers with cane poles, so he turned off a side road and stopped the truck. He lowered the tailgate, dragged her out, and threw her in a small ravine lined with kudzu.  
  
¬† Carl Lee Hailey did not hurry home. Gwen was easily excited, and she had called the mill numerous times when she thought the children had been kidnapped. He punched out at quitting time, and made the thirty-minute drive home in thirty minutes. Anxiety hit him when he turned onto his gravel drive and saw the patrol car parked next to the front porch. Other cars belonging to Owen's family were scattered along the long drive and in the yard, and there was one car he didn't recognize. It had cane poles sticking out the side windows, and there were at least seven straw hats sitting in it.  
  
¬† Where were Tonya and the boys?  
  
¬† As he opened the front door he heard Gwen crying. To his right in the small living room he found a crowd huddled above a small figure lying on the couch. The child was covered with wet towels and surrounded by crying relatives. As he moved to the couch the crying stopped and the crowd backed away. Only Gwen stayed by the girl. She softly stroked her hair. He knelt beside the couch and touched the girl's shoulder. He spoke to his daughter, and she tried to smile. Her face was bloody pulp covered with knots and lacerations. Both eyes were swollen shut and bleeding. His eyes watered as he looked at her tiny body, completely wrapped in towels and bleeding from ankles to forehead.  
  
¬† Carl Lee asked Gwen what happened. She began shaking and wailing, and was led to the kitchen by her brother. Carl Lee stood and turned to the crowd and demanded to know what happened.  
  
¬† Silence.  
  
¬† He asked for the third time. The deputy, Willie Hastings, one of Gwen's cousins, stepped forward and told Carl Lee that some people were fishing down by Foggy Creek when they saw Tonya lying in the middle of the road. She told them her daddy's name, and they brought her home.  
  
¬† Hastings shut up and stared at his feet.  
  
¬† Carl Lee stared at him and waited. Everyone else stopped breathing and watched the floor.  
  
¬† ""What happened, Willie?"" Carl Lee yelled as he stared at the deputy.  
  
¬† Hastings spoke slowly, and while staring out the window repeated what Tonya had told her mother about the white men and their pickup, and the rope and the trees, and being hurt when they got on her. -Hastings stopped when he heard the siren from the ambulance.  
  
¬† The crowd filed solemnly through the front door and waited on the porch, where they watched the crew unload a stretcher and head for the house.  
  
¬† The paramedics stopped in the yard when the front door opened and Carl Lee walked out with his daughter in his arms. He whispered gently to her as huge tears dripped from his chin. He walked to the rear of the ambulance and stepped inside. The paramedics closed the door and carefully removed her from his embrace.  
  
¬† Ozzie Walls was the only black sheriff in Mississippi. There had been a few others in recent history, but for the moment he was the only one. He took great pride in that fact, since Ford County was seventy-four percent white and the other black sheriffs had been from much blacker counties. Not since Reconstruction had a black sheriff been elected in a white county in Mississippi.  
  
¬† He was raised in Ford County, and he was kin to most of the blacks and a few of the whites. After desegregation in the late sixties, he was a member of the first mixed graduating class at Clanton High School. He wanted to play football nearby at Ole Miss, but there were already two blacks on the team. He starred instead at Alcorn State, and was a defensive tackle for the Rams when a knee injury sent him back to Clanton. He missed football, but enjoyed being the high sheriff, especially at election time when he received more . white votes than his white opponents. The white kids loved him because he was a hero, a football star who had played on TV and had his picture in magazines. Their parents respected him and voted for him because he was a tough cop who did not discriminate between black punks and white  
  
¬† Sunks. The white politicians supported him because, since e became the sheriff, the Justi  
ce Department stayed out of Ford County. The blacks adored him because he was Ozzie, one of their own.  
  
¬† He skipped supper and waited in his office at the jail for Hastings to report from the Hailey house. He had a suspect. Billy Ray Cobb was no stranger to the sheriffs office. Ozzie knew he sold drugs-he just couldn't catch him. He also knew Cobb had a mean streak.  
  
¬† The dispatcher called in the deputies, and as they reported to the jail Ozzie gave them instructions to locate, but not arrest, Billy Ray Cobb. There were twelve deputies in all -nine white and three black. They fanned out across the county in search of a fancy yellow Ford pickup with a rebel flag in the rear window.  
  
¬† When Hastings arrived he and the sheriff left for the Ford County hospital. As usual, Hastings drove and Ozzie gave orders on the radio. In the waiting room on the second floor they found the Hailey clan. Aunts, uncles, grandparents, friends, and strangers crowded into the small room and some waited in the narrow hallway. There were whispers and quiet tears. Tonya was in surgery.  
  
¬† Carl Lee sat on a cheap plastic couch in a dark corner with Gwen next to him and the boys next to her. He stared at the floor and did not notice the crowd. Gwen laid her head on his shoulder and cried softly. The boys sat rigidly with their hands on knees, occasionally glancing at their father as if waiting on words of reassurance.  
  
¬† Ozzie worked his way through the crowd, quietly shaking hands and patting backs and whispering that he would catch them. He knelt before Carl Lee and Gwen. ""How is she?"" he asked. Carl Lee did not see him. Gwen cried louder and the boys sniffed and wiped tears. He patted Gwen on the knee and stood. One of her brothers led Ozzie and Hastings out of the room into the hall, away from the family. He shook Ozzie's hand and thanked him for coming.  
  
¬† ""How is she?"" Ozzie asked.  
  
¬† ""Not too good. She's in surgery and most likely will be there for a while. She's got broken fjones and a bad concussion. She's beat up real bad. There's rope burns on her neck like they tried to hang her. ""  
  
¬† ""Was she raped?"" he asked, certain of the answer.  
  
¬† ""Yeah. She told her momma they took turns on her and hurt her real bad. Doctors confirmed it. ""  
  
¬† ""How's Carl Lee and Gwen?""  
  
¬† ""They're tore up pretty bad. I think they're in shock. Carl Lee ain't said a word since he got here. ""  
  
¬† JDzzie assured him they would find the two men, and it wouldn't take long, and when they found them they would be locked up someplace safe. The brother suggested he should hide them in another jail, for their own safety.  
  
¬† Three miles out of Clanton, Ozzie pointed to a gravel driveway. ""Pull in there,"" he told Hastings, who turned off the highway and drove into the front yard of a dilapidated house trailer. It was almost dark.  
  
¬† Ozzie took his night stick and banged violently on the front door. ""Open up, Bumpous!""  
  
¬† The trailer shook and Bumpous scrambled to the bathroom to flush a fresh joint.  
  
¬† ""Open up, Bumpous!"" Ozzie banged. ""I know you're in there. Open up or I'll kick in the door. ""  
  
¬† Bumpous yanked the door open and Ozzie walked in. ""You know, Bumpous, evertime I visit you I smell somethin' funny and the commode's flushin'. Get some clothes on. I gotta job for you. ""  
  
¬† ""W-what?""  
  
¬† ""I'll explain it outside where I can breathe. Just get some clothes on and hurry. ""  
  
¬† ""What if I don't want to?""  
  
¬† ""Fine. I'll see your parole officer tomorrow. ""  
  
¬† ""I'll be out in a minute. ""  
  
¬† Ozzie smiled and walked to his car. Bobby Bumpous was one of his favorites. Since his parole two years earlier, he had led a reasonably clean life, occasionally succumbing to the lure of an easy drug sale for a quick buck. Ozzie watched him like a hawk and knew of such transactions, and Bumpous knew Ozzie knew; therefore, Bumpous was usually most eager to help his friend, Sheriff Walls. The plan was to eventually use Bumpous to nail Billy Ray Cobb for dealing, but that would be postponed for now.  
  
¬† After a few minutes he marched outside, still tucking his shirttail and zipping his pants. ""Who you lookin' for?"" he demanded.  
  
¬† ""Billy Ray Cobb. ""  
  
¬† ""That's no problem. You can find him without me. ""  
  
¬† ""Shut up and listen. We think Cobb was involved in a rape this afternoon. A black girl was raped by two white men, and I think Cobb was there. ""  
  
¬† ""Cobb ain't into rape, Sheriff. He's into drugs, remember?""  
  
¬† ""Shut up and listen. You find Cobb and spend some time with him. Five minutes ago his truck was spotted at Huey's. Buy him a beer. Shoot some pool, roll dice, whatever. Find out what he did today. Who was he with? Where'd he go? You know how he likes to talk, right?""  
  
¬† ""Right. ""  
  
¬† ""Call the dispatcher when you find him. They'll call me. I'll be somewhere close. You understand?""  
  
¬† ""Sure, Sheriff. No problem. ""  
  
¬† ""Any questions?""  
  
¬† ""Yeah. I'm broke. Who's gonna pay for this?""  
  
¬† Ozzie handed him a twenty and left. Hastings drove in the direction of Huey's, down by the lake.  
  
¬† ""You sure you can trust him?"" Hastings asked. . ""Who?""  
  
¬† ""That Bumpous kid. ""  
  
¬† ""Sure I trust him. He's proved very reliable since he was paroled. He's a good kid tryin' to go straight, for the most part. He supports his local sheriff and would do anything I ask. ""  
  
¬† ""Why?""  
  
¬† ""Because I caught him with ten ounces of pot a year ago. He'd been outta jail about a year when I caught his brother with an ounce, and I told him he was lookin' at thirty years. He started cryin' and carryin' on, cried all night in his cell. By mornin' he was ready to talk. Told me his supplier was his brother, Bobby. So I let him go and went to see Bobby. I knocked on his door and I could hear the commode flushin'. He wouldn't come to the door, so I kicked it in. I found him in his underwear in the bathroom tryin' to unstop the commode. There was dope all over the place. Don't know how much he flushed, but most of it was comin' back out in the overflow. Scared him so bad he wet his drawers. ""  
  
¬† ""You kiddin'?""  
  
¬† ""Nope. The kid pissed all over himself. He was a sight standin' there with wet drawers, a plunger in one hand, dope in the other, and the room fillin' up with commode water. ""  
  
¬† ""What'd you do?""  
  
¬† ""Threatened to kill him. ""  
  
¬† ""What'd he do?""  
  
¬† ""Started cryin'. Cried like a baby. Cried 'bout his momma and prison and all this and that. Promised he'd never screw up again. ""  
  
¬† ""You arrest him?""  
  
¬† ""Naw, I just couldn't. I talked real ugly to him and threatened him some more. I put him on probation right there in his bathroom. He's been fun to work with ever since. ""  
  
¬† They drove by Huey's and saw Cobb's truck in the gravel parking lot with a dozen other pickups and four-wheel drives. They parked behind a black church on a hill up the highway from Huey's, where they had a good view of the honky tonk, or tonk, as it was affectionately called by the patrons. Another patrol car hid behind some trees at the other end of the highway. Moments later Bumpous flew by and wheeled into the parking lot. He locked his brakes, spraying gravel and dust, then backed next to Cobb's truck. He looked around and casually entered Huey's. Thirty minutes later the dispatcher advised Ozzie that the informant had found the subject, a male white, at Huey's, an establishment on Highway 305 near the lake. Within minutes two more patrol cars were hidden close by. They waited.  
  
¬† ""What makes you so sure it's Cobb?"" Hastings asked.  
  
¬† ""I ain't sure. I just got a hunch. The little girl said it was a truck with shiny wheels and big tires. ""  
  
¬† ""That narrows it down to two thousand. ""  
  
¬† ""She also said it was yellow, looked new, and had a big flag hangin' in the rear window. ""  
  
¬† ""That brings it down to two hundred. ""  
  
¬† ""Maybe less than that. How many of those are as mean as Billy Ray Cobb?""  
  
¬† ""What if it ain't him?""  
  
¬† ""It is. ""  
  
¬† ""If it ain't?""  
  
¬† ""We'll know shortly. He's got a big mouth, 'specially when he's drinkin'. ""  
  
¬† For two hours t  
hey waited and watched pickups come and go. Truck drivers, pulpwood cutters, factory workers, and farmhands parked their pickups and jeeps in the gravel and strutted inside to drink, shoot pool, listen to the band, but mainly to look for stray women. Some would leave and walk next door to Ann's Lounge, where they would stay for a few minutes and return to Huey's. Ann's Lounge was darker both inside and out, and it lacked the colorful beer signs and live music that made Huey's such a hit with the locals. Ann's  
  
¬† was known for its drug traffic, whereas Huey's had it all- music, women, happy hours, poker machines, dice, dancing, and plenty of fights. One brawl spilled through the door into the parking lot, where a group of wild rednecks kicked and clawed each other at random until they grew winded and returned to the dice table.  
  
¬† ""Hope that wasn't Bumpous,"" observed the sheriff.  
  
¬† The restrooms inside were small and nasty, and most of the patrons found it necessary to relieve themselves between the pickups in the parking lot. This was especially true on Mondays when ten-cent beer night drew rednecks from four counties and every truck in the parking lot received at least three sprayings. About once a week an innocent passing motorist would get shocked by something he or she saw in the parking lot, and Ozzie would be forced to make an arrest. Otherwise, he left the places alone.  
  
¬† Both tonks were in violation of numerous laws. There was gambling, drugs, illegal whiskey, minors, they refused to close on time, etc. Shortly after he was elected the first time Ozzie made the mistake, due in part to a hasty campaign promise, of closing all the honky tonks in the county. It was a horrible mistake. The crime rate soared. The jail was packed. The court dockets multiplied. The rednecks united and drove in caravans to Clanton, where they parked around the courthouse on the square. Hundreds of them. Every night they invaded the square, drinking, fighting, playing loud music, and shouting obscenities at the horrified town folk. Each morning the square resembled a landfill with cans and bottles thrown everywhere. He closed the black tonks too, and break-ins, burglaries, and stabbings tripled in one month. There were two murders in one week.  
  
¬† Finally, with the city under siege, a group of local ministers met secretly with Ozzie and begged him to ease up on the tonks. He politely reminded them that during the campaign they had insisted on the closings. They admitted they were wrong and pleaded for relief. Yes, they would support him in the next election. Ozzie relented, and life returned to normal in Ford County.  
  
¬† Ozzie was not pleased that the establishments thrived in his county, but he was convinced beyond any doubt that his law-abiding constituents were much safer when the tonks were open.  
  
¬† At ten-thirty the dispatcher radioed that the informant was on the phone and wanted to see the sheriff. Ozzie gave his location, and a minute later they watched Bumpous emerge and stagger to his truck. He spun tires, slung gravel, and raced toward the church.  
  
¬† ""He's drunk,"" said Hastings.  
  
¬† He wheeled through the church parking lot and came to a screeching stop a few feet from the patrol car. ""Howdy, Sheriff!"" he yelled.  
  
¬† Ozzie walked to the pickup. ""What took so long?""  
  
¬† ""You told me to take all night. ""  
  
¬† ""You found him two hours ago. ""  
  
¬† ""That's true, Sheriff, but have you ever tried to spend twenty dollars on beer when it's fifty cents a can?""  
  
¬† ""You drunk?""  
  
¬† ""Naw, just havin' a good time. Could I have another twenty?""  
  
¬† ""What'd you find out?""  
  
¬† "" 'Bout what?""  
  
¬† ""Cobb!""  
  
¬† ""Oh, he's in there all right. ""  
  
¬† ""I know he's in there! What else?""  
  
¬† Bumpous quit smiling and looked at the tonk in the distance. ""He's laughin' about it, Sheriff. It's a big joke. Said he finally found a nigger who was a virgin. Somebody asked how old she was, and Cobb said eight or nine. Everybody laughed. ""  
  
¬† Hastings closed his eyes and dropped his head. Ozzie gritted his teeth and looked away. ""What else did he say?""  
  
¬† ""He's bad drunk. He won't remember any of it in the mornin'. Said she was a cute little nigger. ""  
  
¬† ""Who was with him?""  
  
¬† ""Pete Willard. ""  
  
¬† ""Is he in there?""  
  
¬† ""Yep, they're both laughin' about it. ""  
  
¬† ""Where are they?""  
  
¬† ""Left-hand side, next to the pinball machines. ""  
  
¬† Ozzie smiled. ""Okay, Bumpous. You did good. Get lost. ""  
  
¬† Hastings called the dispatcher with the two names. The dispatcher relayed the message to Deputy Looney, who was parked in the street in front of the home of County Judge Percy Bullard. Looney rang the doorbell and handed the judge two affidavits and two arrest warrants. Bullard scribbled on the warrants and returned them to Looney, who thanked His Honor and left. Twenty minutes later Looney handed the warrants to Ozzie behind the church.  
  
¬† At exactly eleven, the band quit in mid-song, the dice disappeared, the dancers froze, the cue balls stopped rolling, and someone turned on the lights. All eyes followed the big sheriff as he and his men swaggered slowly across the dance floor to a table by the pinball machines. Cobb, Willard, and two others sat in a booth, the table littered with empty beer cans Ozzie walked to the table and grinned at Cobb.  
  
¬† ""I'm sorry, sir, but we don't allow niggers in here,"" Cobb blurted out, and the four burst into laughter. Ozzie kept grinning.  
  
¬† When the laughing stopped, Ozzie said, ""You boys havin' a good time, Billy Ray?""  
  
¬† ""We was. ""  
  
¬† ""Looks like it. I hate to break things up, but you and Mr. Willard need to come with me. ""  
  
¬† ""Where we goin'?"" Willard asked.  
  
¬† ""For a ride. ""  
  
¬† ""I ain't movin',"" Cobb vowed. With that, the other two scooted from the booth and joined the spectators.  
  
¬† ""I'm placin' you both under arrest,"" Ozzie said.  
  
¬† ""You got warrants?"" Cobb asked.  
  
¬† Hastings produced the warrants, and Ozzie threw them among the beer cans. ""Yeah, we got warrants. Now get up. ""  
  
¬† Willard stared desperately at Cobb, who sipped a beer and said, ""I ain't goin' to jail. ""  
  
¬† Looney handed Ozzie the longest, blackest nightstick ever used in Ford County. Willard was panic-stricken. Ozzie cocked it and struck the center of the table, sending beer and cans and foam in all directions. Willard bolted upright, slapped his wrists together and thrust them at Looney, who was waiting with the handcuffs. He was dragged outside and thrown into a patrol car.  
  
¬† Ozzie tapped his left palm with the stick and grinned at  
  
¬† Cobb. ""You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say will be used against you in court. You have the right to a lawyer. If you can't afford one, the state'll furnish one. Any questions?""  
  
¬† ""Yeah, what time is it?""  
  
¬† ""Time to go to jail, big man. ""  
  
¬† ""Go to hell, nigger. ""  
  
¬† Ozzie grabbed his hair and lifted him from the booth, then drove his face into the floor. He jammed a knee into his spine and slid his nightstick under his throat, and pulled upward while driving the knee deeper into his back. Cobb squealed until the stick began crushing his larynx.  
  
¬† The handcuffs were slapped into place, and Ozzie dragged him by his hair across the dance floor, out the door, across the gravel and threw him into the back seat with Wil-lard.  
  
¬† News of the rape spread quickly. More friends and relatives crowded into the waiting room and the halls around it. Tonya was out of surgery and listed as critical. Ozzie talked to Gwen's brother in the hall and told of the arrests. Yes, they were the ones, he was sure.  
  
¬† Jake Brigance rolled across his wife and staggered to the small bathroom a few feet from his bed, where he searched and groped in the dark for the screaming alarm clock. He found it where he had left it, and killed it with a quick and violent slap. It was 5:30 A. M. , Wednesday, May 15.  
  
¬† He stood in the dark for a moment, breathless, terrified, his heart pounding rapidly, staring at the fluorescent numbers glowing at him from the face of the clock, a clock he hated. Its piercing scream could be heard down the street. He flirted with  
cardiac arrest every morning at this time when the thing erupted. On occasion, about twice a year, he was successful in shoving Carla onto the floor, and she would maybe turn it off before returning to bed. Most of the time, however, she was not sympathetic. She thought he was crazy for getting up at such an hour.  
  
¬† The clock sat on the windowsill so that Jake was required to move around a bit before it was silenced. Once up, Jake would not permit himself to crawl back under the covers. It was one of his rules. At one time the alarm was on the nightstand, and the volume was reduced. Carla would reach and turn it off before Jake heard anything. Then he would sleep until seven or eight and ruin his entire day. He would miss being in the office by seven, which was another rule. The alarm stayed in the bathroom and served its purpose.  
  
¬† Jake stepped to the sink and splashed cold water on'his face and hair. He switched on the light and gasped in horror at the sight in the mirror. His straight brown hair shot in all directions, and the hairline had receded at least two inches during the night. Either that or his forehead had grown. His eyes were matted and swollen with the white stuff packed in the corners. A seam in a blanket left a bright red scar along the left side of his face. He touched, then rubbed it and wondered if it would go away. With his right hand he pushed his hair back and inspected the hairline. At thirty-two, he had no gray hair. Gray hair was not the problem. The problem was pattern baldness, which Jake had richly inherited from both sides of his family. He longed for a full, thick hairline beginning an inch above his eyebrows. He still had plenty of hair, Carla told him. But it wouldn't last long at the rate it was disappearing. She also assured him he was as handsome as ever, and he believed her. She had explained that a receding hairline gave him a look of maturity that was essential for a young attorney. He believed that too.  
  
¬† But what about old, bald attorneys, or even mature, middle-aged bald attorneys? Why couldn't the hair return after he grew wrinkles and gray sideburns and looked very mature?  
  
¬† Jake pondered these things in the shower. He took quick showers, and he shaved and dressed quickly. He had to be at the Coffee Shop at 6:00 A. M. -another rule. He turned on lights and slammed and banged drawers and closet doors in an effort to arouse Carla. This was the morning ritual during the summer when she was not teaching school. He had explained to her numerous times that she had all day to catch up on any lost sleep, and that these early moments should be spent together. She moaned and tunneled deeper under the covers. Once dressed, Jake jumped on the bed with all fours and kissed her in the ear, down the neck, and all over the face until she finally swung at him. Then he yanked the covers off the bed and laughed as she curled up and shivered and begged for the blankets. He held them and admired her dark, tanned, thin, almost perfect legs. The bulky nightshirt covered nothing below the waist, and a hundred lewd thoughts danced before him.  
  
¬† About once a month this ritual would get out of hand. She would not protest, and the blankets would be jointly removed. On those mornings Jake undressed even quicker and broke at least three of his rules. That's how Hanna was conceived.  
  
¬† But not this morning. He covered his wife, kissed her gently, and turned out the lights. She breathed easier, and fell asleep.  
  
¬† Down the hall he quietly opened Hanna's door and knelt beside her. She was four, the only child, and there would be no others. She lay in her bed surrounded by dolls and stuffed animals. He kissed her lightly on the cheek. She was as beautiful as her mother, and the two were identical in looks and manners. They had large bluish-gray eyes that could cry instantly, if necessary. They wore their dark hair the same way-had it cut by the same person at the same time. They even dressed alike.  
  
¬† Jake adored the two women in his life. He kissed the second one goodbye and went to the kitchen to make coffee for Carla. On his way out he released Max, the mutt, into the backyard, where she simultaneously relieved herself and barked at Mrs. Pickle's cat next door.  
  
¬† Few people attacked the morning like Jake Brigance. He walked briskly to the end of the driveway and got the morning papers for Carla. It was dark, clear, and cool with the promise of summer rapidly approaching.  
  
¬† He studied the darkness up and down Adams Street, then turned and admired his house. Two homes in Ford County were on the National Register of Historic Places, and Jake Brigance owned one of them. Although it was heavily mortgaged, he was proud of it nonetheless. It was a nineteenth-century Victorian built by a retired railroad man who died on the first Christmas Eve he spent in his new home. The facade was a huge, centered gable with hipped roof over a wide, inset front porch. Under the gable a small portico covered with bargeboard hung gently over the porch. The five supporting pillars were round and painted white and slate blue. Each column bore a handmade floral carving, each with a different flower-daffodils, irises, and sunflowers. The railing between the pillars was filled with lavish lacework. Upstairs, three bay windows opened onto a small balcony, and to the left of the balcony an octagonal tower with stained-glass windows protruded and rose above the gable until it peaked with an iron-crested finial. Below the tower and to the left of the porch, a wide, graceful veranda with ornamental railing extended from the house and served as a carport. The front panels were a collage of gingerbread, cedar shingles, scallops, fish scales, tiny intricate gables, and miniature spindles.

If it‚Äôs not too much to ask, I wanted to get your advice on a situation in my life.

For a year and a half, I‚Äôve developed a connection with an woman, while I myself am a woman. I can say that everything happened unexpectedly, as I was in a long-term relationship with my partner at the time. I started going to the gym because I no longer felt comfortable in my own skin. As a result, I got a gym membership.

There, working as a personal trainer, was a very beautiful woman whom I admired from a distance from the very first moment. I never imagined she would ever look at me, as I was overweight and hadn‚Äôt exercised in many years, so I didn‚Äôt even consider the possibility.

Well, she was the woman I mentioned earlier. Little by little, I noticed that she started observing me very closely. Then, she approached me. She asked me what I did for a living, what my name was, and offered to help me with some exercises. At first, I was convinced that her behavior was simply because she wanted to help the gym clients‚Äîwhich was true, since she‚Äôs a very altruistic and outgoing person. Later on, I noticed that she seemed very nervous when she talked to me; her hands were shaking, and she was breathing heavily. Although she tried quite hard to appear relaxed. Then, she started looking at me intensely from different corners of the gym, as if she wanted to read me, to understand me.

To test the waters, I invited my partner to the gym with me. She accompanied me. I wanted to be honest from the very beginning about my orientation, as well as about the stable relationship I had at that time.

The woman‚Äôs reaction was again one of curiosity and observation. While my partner and I were at the gym for an hour, she looked almost exclusively at us, studying us from every angle. And she did it in the most obvious way.

As a result, in time, I also started looking at her intensely and searching for her smile in the gym. We began chatting about various things, and I gave her a toy for her dog as a gift since we started talking a lot about our dogs.

She even sent me a video on Instagram of her dog playing with the toy I gave her and apologized for not being able to send the video sooner.

She started asking me about my job and noticed when I was tired or stressed from how much work I had. I found that very sweet of her.

One day she positioned herself in front of me at a thigh machine in the gym and started working out in a way that seemed entirely dedicated to me. I had never seen anything like it before. She touched herself and moved in ways I had never seen anyone do before in the gym, and all the while, she looked me straight in the eyes to observe my reaction. Then, she tactfully came after me to the locker room and asked me how I found that day‚Äôs workout. It was just the two of us in the locker room. I was still in shock and didn‚Äôt know what to say. Obviously, I had really enjoyed it, but I was truly at a loss for words. I managed to say only that it was very good and pleasant, but that I was a bit tired.

I don‚Äôt think it was the reaction she expected, but that‚Äôs all I could say since I was completely speechless.

During all this time, she was liking my posts and stories on Instagram, and I was liking hers. We were in almost constant contact.

So, I felt it was time to show my interest in her more clearly. One day, I hugged her from behind with one arm and pulled her close to me. I held her like that for a few moments, then let go. It was unexpected and unplanned, but I wanted her close to me.

Neither she nor I said a word. When I let her go, I went into the bathroom, and when I came out, she had already left the locker room. The next day, we saw each other again in the gym. It was very crowded. She smiled at me charmingly as soon as she saw me and gravitated around me, even though she had a client at the time. You could see happiness and delight in her eyes. Even though neither of us said anything about the event from the previous day.

After all these events, I gathered the courage and messaged her on Instagram, inviting her to a movie because I had two tickets to a cute animated film. She politely declined, although from her response, it seemed like she wanted to say yes but was afraid.

Since she didn‚Äôt come, I went to the movie with my partner at that time, as I hadn‚Äôt broken up with her yet. I posted a story with my girlfriend at the movie. This gesture upset her a lot. And I understand her.

In turn, as a response, she posted a story from the gym while she was working out, and in the background, she had a song playing about freedom and how in a relationship you shouldn‚Äôt have to obey rules, like in a cage.

Her reaction amused me and flattered me. I was beginning to understand that this beautiful woman was truly interested in me.

Then, at the gym, in person, she asked me how the movie was. I replied that it was okay, but that I would have liked her to come with me.

She seemed like a person of contrasts, full of contradictions, unlike anyone I had ever met before.

I got over the movie incident, and we grew closer again at the gym. She continued to smile at me, look for me with her eyes, and had flirtatious gestures around me.

So, a few weeks later, I invited her for a coffee. I‚Äôm a Leo (she is Aquarius), so I have a more direct approach; sometimes I don‚Äôt really know how to be more discreet. If I like something or someone, I‚Äôm pretty obvious about it. And honestly, it seemed like she was attracted to my direct approach. Obviously, she rejected me this time as well.

In response, I was as honest as possible and told her that I didn‚Äôt understand what she wanted from me if she seemed so interested and close, but whenever I invited her somewhere, she constantly refused.

In response, she blocked me on Instagram and told me never to talk to her at the gym again, except about sports or exclusively about exercises in the gym. Also, she told me that whatever I think might exist between us, I‚Äôm wrong ‚Äî and that there is, in fact, no connection between us (even though she had been the one constantly reaching out to me for such a long time). I got upset and angry at that moment, but at the same time, I found her reply amusing because she was telling me not to approach her, yet if I needed something, I should tell her.

Nevertheless, I started to respect what she told me. I stopped talking to her at the gym and even started avoiding her. She made a post on Instagram where she filmed herself in black and white on a workout machine, with the song Tattoo by Loreen playing in the background.

Obviously, the song seemed to be dedicated to our situation, which I once again found amusing, because I wanted her in my life and couldn‚Äôt understand what she wanted. Or what mistake I had made.

Then, one day, she positioned herself in my line of sight and started walking toward me with small, hesitant steps and tears in her eyes. I could feel pain and longing in her gaze. It was as if she was silently asking me why I had left her, why I wasn‚Äôt seeking her out anymore.

So‚Ä¶ I gave in. I started smiling at her again, looking for her with my eyes, greeting her, and we began to talk shyly about our lives. Everything went unexpectedly well, although it's worth noting that I was still blocked on her Instagram. :)))

For me, all the contradiction in her behavior seemed irresistible.

After the coffee incident, it's worth mentioning that she came to the gym when it wasn‚Äôt her shift, just for a visit (knowing I was there, since I had posted about it) and brought a takeaway coffee. And while I was working out, she lingered around me with that coffee, seeming very emotional, but she didn‚Äôt say a single word. :))

Then, a man ‚Äî a regular client at the gym ‚Äî started flirting with me. I wasn‚Äôt interested, as I‚Äôm a lesbian and love women exclusively, but of course, I tried to be polite and friendly.

One day, my beloved Aquarius had a jealousy outburst because this man kept approaching me. She came over to me from the other side of the gym and started scolding me for not putting the weights back. Yes, it had happened‚ÄîI had forgotten‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt intentional, and there was no need for her to raise her voice. Of course, she wasn‚Äôt really angry about the weights; she was clearly irritated by the conversations between me and that man.

I found her reaction childish and it didn‚Äôt make me feel good, but at the same time, I was amused that this grown woman‚Äîolder than me‚Äîwas reacting that way. I wanted to tell her directly to calm down because my eyes were only for her, but I couldn‚Äôt say that because I knew she would react badly again.

After that, her reaction intensified, and she started flirting with different men at the gym to test me and make me jealous. Basically, I tried to stay calm and not play her game, but her reaction became painful, so I started to withdraw again.

We started not talking again, but she kept looking for me with her eyes, following me into the locker room, and positioning herself at machines next to me.

For New Year‚Äôs Eve, I went to a cabin in the mountains with my girlfriend and posted a photo from there on Instagram. I was resigned to never being in a relationship with the beautiful and misunderstood woman from the gym. Despite this, I wanted us to be on good terms at least, so I sent her a friendly but neutral New Year‚Äôs greeting. She replied: ""May you have a new year full of love."" :)))

After New Year's, she got upset again when the same man came to talk to me at the gym, and once again she hid her jealousy behind clich√© remarks. Moreover, I think she was still irritated because she had seen that I had spent the holidays with my girlfriend at the time. She came up to me to scold me for making too much noise on the machines. :)))

Her reaction struck me as hilarious, and I wanted to shake her and tell her everything I felt for her.

So, I approached her directly. She wasn‚Äôt expecting that. I went to her desk at the gym and told her that I really didn‚Äôt understand what she wanted, and if she wanted to talk to me, she should do it genuinely‚Äînot make up pathetic excuses for conversations and reasons to argue. I also said that I‚Äôm open to having a conversation, but only if it‚Äôs based on authenticity and honesty. She was speechless. She couldn‚Äôt believe I was so real, so direct. I could see the surprise in her eyes.

Although that moment was problematic, it seemed like her entire behavior changed afterward. Instead of pushing us apart, that moment brought us closer.

I was still blocked on Instagram, but she started posting various stories and posts about our situation on her profile. Of course, she didn‚Äôt do it directly. She would put suggestive songs for each moment between us, videos, and memes that perfectly expressed the events we were going through. I managed to see all of this through websites that let you view Instagram stories anonymously. At first, it seemed silly and childish to me, but then I realized that‚Äôs how she communicated‚Äîindirectly, where she felt comfortable.

As an experiment, I also started posting stories and posts about our situation on Instagram to see if she was following my profile. Soon, she started responding indirectly to absolutely everything I posted. A sign that, yes, it was as I suspected‚Äîshe was also watching my posts and stories through anonymous sites.

I started posting pictures of my favorite food. In response, she would post stories with the same food she made at home. Everything unfolded like a tennis match of love. Subtly, with a lot of emotion, a sense of complicity, and affection.

Then, I noticed at the gym that she started copying my movements, even though it‚Äôs worth mentioning that I am a beginner at the gym‚Äîor at least I was‚Äîbecause in the meantime, I lost 28 kg and went 4-5 times a week consistently, becoming a regular client.

And here we are now, in the present moment, where it often seems to me that she wants closeness between us but doesn‚Äôt know exactly how to achieve it.

On Women‚Äôs Day, she gave me a rose. It was the gym's policy to offer each woman a rose on this occasion, even so her hand was shaking badly when she handed me the flower and she wanted to appear brave. I would have loved to gently caress her right then and there and kiss her hand, but I know she doesn‚Äôt want that. She wants to appear strong and be treated as a strong woman, for her, revealing her feelings is equivalent to vulnerability. After she gave me the rose, she was so shaken and emotional that she couldn‚Äôt look me in the eyes at all until I left the gym.

I studied her gestures when she gave each of the other clients a flower. ‚ÄúGave‚Äù is a bit of an overstatement, since, unlike the gesture she made toward me, with the others she only congratulated them on Women‚Äôs Day and encouraged them to choose a rose themselves from the bucket.

I often catch her watching me from a distance, both when I'm alone and when I'm around others. If she notices that I've seen her gaze, she gets shy, hides, or pretends to look elsewhere. I find these gestures of hers very endearing, even though they're a bit childish. I also get the impression sometimes that she doesn't allow herself to get close to me, even though her desire is visible.

Moreover, I believe that our whole connection is somewhat inhibited by the environment in which we see each other ‚Äî the gym ‚Äî since that's her workplace, and I know she wants to appear, and truly is, professional in what she does. However, of course, she has already turned me down twice when I suggested we go out.

So, how do you advise me to proceed?

I feel like I‚Äôve fallen in love with her, but her approach to our connection is exhausting me. I‚Äôm not like that. I‚Äôm a balanced and rational person, and I care about her, but I wish this whole game would start to make sense. I no longer have the energy to decipher her insecure and ambiguous behavior, even though I‚Äôm almost certain she‚Äôs fallen in love with me too. But honestly, I have no idea how we can break out of this vicious cycle.

Thank you if you had the patience to read everything until the end.I tried to describe the situation as faithfully as possible so that you could give me some advice. Any piece of advice is welcome, and I trust that you can help me figure out what‚Äôs the best way to move forward.

I thank you from the bottom of my heart for any kind of response or solution.",3,1752395216.0,aquarius,4,1.0,False

b) The English language is a joke that‚Äôs not even funny so I don‚Äôt respect it enough to even respect its writing rules.

c) I am literally writing it while being in the toilet at my job. Don‚Äôt take it seriously.

Also pls remember it‚Äôs all shit and jiggles. My math and theories can be wrong because I never saw a woman in real life before, just like a true Zenless player.



Let‚Äôs start with raw numbers first. Thanks to amazing graph done by u/SexyMediumVioletOni (btw pls answer DMs), we know that Yi Xuan is 172 centimeters tall, with her honkers badonkers reaching the size of 75.1 cm which is categorized to size 22G in england or size I in EU and US. 

We know that breasts can grow up to one and a half or maybe even twice the size during pregnancy aka the time period where lactation is most likely to happen, however we‚Äôre going to ignore this fact because that would only make our size brackets more muddy and unclear.  

With all those numbers and sizes we have proven that Yi Xuan set of front bumpers is ridiculously big, defending the title of ‚Äúgooner game‚Äù. We of course already knew that they are big, but just like our math teacher wanted us to prove that a triangle is indeed a triangle, we had to use math to be extra sure. 



As I learned in my post where I calculated which ZZZ character would produce the most breast milk - the size is not the only factor that determines the amount of this godlike delicacy to be produced. Surprisingly, it‚Äôs not even the most important one. 

We know that the amount and quality of milk depends on quality of life, mental state and diet of a woman. 



Being a Shifu might seem like a stressful job for us, since you are a head of the literal occult of monks but throughout the entire story of Patch 2.0 and before, we can notice that Yi Xuan is always rather calm. Even when the most heated scenario is coming towards her, she always makes sure to keep her head clear. 



We also know that her diet is top notch. With her junior - Pan Yinhu - in the kitchen, Yi Xuan has zero reasons to complain about her dinners. It is important information because a well balanced diet is one of the key factors in milk production.



The average amount of milk a woman can produce during her lactation is around 1.2 to 1.5 liters a day. This amount is pretty okay. Definitely would be enough for a couple cups of coffee during your normal day. However, while researching I found out that the most amount of milk a woman can produce is a staggering 5 LITERS OF PURE BREAST MILK A DAY. 5 Liters, 5000 milliliters or around 169 ounces of perfection. Due to Yi Xuan being a calm person with a well balanced diet and gigantic calcium canons, we are free to assume that this amount is very much possible to achieve by her.  



Thanks for reading, good luck with your pulls and have a nice day!

If it‚Äôs not too much to ask, I wanted to get your advice on a situation in my life.

For a year and a half, I‚Äôve developed a connection with an woman, while I myself am a woman. I can say that everything happened unexpectedly, as I was in a long-term relationship with my partner at the time. I started going to the gym because I no longer felt comfortable in my own skin. As a result, I got a gym membership.

There, working as a personal trainer, was a very beautiful woman whom I admired from a distance from the very first moment. I never imagined she would ever look at me, as I was overweight and hadn‚Äôt exercised in many years, so I didn‚Äôt even consider the possibility.

Well, she was the woman I mentioned earlier. Little by little, I noticed that she started observing me very closely. Then, she approached me. She asked me what I did for a living, what my name was, and offered to help me with some exercises. At first, I was convinced that her behavior was simply because she wanted to help the gym clients‚Äîwhich was true, since she‚Äôs a very altruistic and outgoing person. Later on, I noticed that she seemed very nervous when she talked to me; her hands were shaking, and she was breathing heavily. Although she tried quite hard to appear relaxed. Then, she started looking at me intensely from different corners of the gym, as if she wanted to read me, to understand me.

To test the waters, I invited my partner to the gym with me. She accompanied me. I wanted to be honest from the very beginning about my orientation, as well as about the stable relationship I had at that time.

The woman‚Äôs reaction was again one of curiosity and observation. While my partner and I were at the gym for an hour, she looked almost exclusively at us, studying us from every angle. And she did it in the most obvious way.

As a result, in time, I also started looking at her intensely and searching for her smile in the gym. We began chatting about various things, and I gave her a toy for her dog as a gift since we started talking a lot about our dogs.

She even sent me a video on Instagram of her dog playing with the toy I gave her and apologized for not being able to send the video sooner.

She started asking me about my job and noticed when I was tired or stressed from how much work I had. I found that very sweet of her.

One day she positioned herself in front of me at a thigh machine in the gym and started working out in a way that seemed entirely dedicated to me. I had never seen anything like it before. She touched herself and moved in ways I had never seen anyone do before in the gym, and all the while, she looked me straight in the eyes to observe my reaction. Then, she tactfully came after me to the locker room and asked me how I found that day‚Äôs workout. It was just the two of us in the locker room. I was still in shock and didn‚Äôt know what to say. Obviously, I had really enjoyed it, but I was truly at a loss for words. I managed to say only that it was very good and pleasant, but that I was a bit tired.

I don‚Äôt think it was the reaction she expected, but that‚Äôs all I could say since I was completely speechless.

During all this time, she was liking my posts and stories on Instagram, and I was liking hers. We were in almost constant contact.

So, I felt it was time to show my interest in her more clearly. One day, I hugged her from behind with one arm and pulled her close to me. I held her like that for a few moments, then let go. It was unexpected and unplanned, but I wanted her close to me.

Neither she nor I said a word. When I let her go, I went into the bathroom, and when I came out, she had already left the locker room. The next day, we saw each other again in the gym. It was very crowded. She smiled at me charmingly as soon as she saw me and gravitated around me, even though she had a client at the time. You could see happiness and delight in her eyes. Even though neither of us said anything about the event from the previous day.

After all these events, I gathered the courage and messaged her on Instagram, inviting her to a movie because I had two tickets to a cute animated film. She politely declined, although from her response, it seemed like she wanted to say yes but was afraid.

Since she didn‚Äôt come, I went to the movie with my partner at that time, as I hadn‚Äôt broken up with her yet. I posted a story with my girlfriend at the movie. This gesture upset her a lot. And I understand her.

In turn, as a response, she posted a story from the gym while she was working out, and in the background, she had a song playing about freedom and how in a relationship you shouldn‚Äôt have to obey rules, like in a cage.

Her reaction amused me and flattered me. I was beginning to understand that this beautiful woman was truly interested in me.

Then, at the gym, in person, she asked me how the movie was. I replied that it was okay, but that I would have liked her to come with me.

She seemed like a person of contrasts, full of contradictions, unlike anyone I had ever met before.

I got over the movie incident, and we grew closer again at the gym. She continued to smile at me, look for me with her eyes, and had flirtatious gestures around me.

So, a few weeks later, I invited her for a coffee. I‚Äôm a Leo (she is Aquarius), so I have a more direct approach; sometimes I don‚Äôt really know how to be more discreet. If I like something or someone, I‚Äôm pretty obvious about it. And honestly, it seemed like she was attracted to my direct approach. Obviously, she rejected me this time as well.

In response, I was as honest as possible and told her that I didn‚Äôt understand what she wanted from me if she seemed so interested and close, but whenever I invited her somewhere, she constantly refused.

In response, she blocked me on Instagram and told me never to talk to her at the gym again, except about sports or exclusively about exercises in the gym. Also, she told me that whatever I think might exist between us, I‚Äôm wrong ‚Äî and that there is, in fact, no connection between us (even though she had been the one constantly reaching out to me for such a long time). I got upset and angry at that moment, but at the same time, I found her reply amusing because she was telling me not to approach her, yet if I needed something, I should tell her.

Nevertheless, I started to respect what she told me. I stopped talking to her at the gym and even started avoiding her. She made a post on Instagram where she filmed herself in black and white on a workout machine, with the song Tattoo by Loreen playing in the background.

Obviously, the song seemed to be dedicated to our situation, which I once again found amusing, because I wanted her in my life and couldn‚Äôt understand what she wanted. Or what mistake I had made.

Then, one day, she positioned herself in my line of sight and started walking toward me with small, hesitant steps and tears in her eyes. I could feel pain and longing in her gaze. It was as if she was silently asking me why I had left her, why I wasn‚Äôt seeking her out anymore.

So‚Ä¶ I gave in. I started smiling at her again, looking for her with my eyes, greeting her, and we began to talk shyly about our lives. Everything went unexpectedly well, although it's worth noting that I was still blocked on her Instagram. :)))

For me, all the contradiction in her behavior seemed irresistible.

After the coffee incident, it's worth mentioning that she came to the gym when it wasn‚Äôt her shift, just for a visit (knowing I was there, since I had posted about it) and brought a takeaway coffee. And while I was working out, she lingered around me with that coffee, seeming very emotional, but she didn‚Äôt say a single word. :))

Then, a man ‚Äî a regular client at the gym ‚Äî started flirting with me. I wasn‚Äôt interested, as I‚Äôm a lesbian and love women exclusively, but of course, I tried to be polite and friendly.

One day, my beloved Aquarius had a jealousy outburst because this man kept approaching me. She came over to me from the other side of the gym and started scolding me for not putting the weights back. Yes, it had happened‚ÄîI had forgotten‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt intentional, and there was no need for her to raise her voice. Of course, she wasn‚Äôt really angry about the weights; she was clearly irritated by the conversations between me and that man.

I found her reaction childish and it didn‚Äôt make me feel good, but at the same time, I was amused that this grown woman‚Äîolder than me‚Äîwas reacting that way. I wanted to tell her directly to calm down because my eyes were only for her, but I couldn‚Äôt say that because I knew she would react badly again.

After that, her reaction intensified, and she started flirting with different men at the gym to test me and make me jealous. Basically, I tried to stay calm and not play her game, but her reaction became painful, so I started to withdraw again.

We started not talking again, but she kept looking for me with her eyes, following me into the locker room, and positioning herself at machines next to me.

For New Year‚Äôs Eve, I went to a cabin in the mountains with my girlfriend and posted a photo from there on Instagram. I was resigned to never being in a relationship with the beautiful and misunderstood woman from the gym. Despite this, I wanted us to be on good terms at least, so I sent her a friendly but neutral New Year‚Äôs greeting. She replied: ""May you have a new year full of love."" :)))

After New Year's, she got upset again when the same man came to talk to me at the gym, and once again she hid her jealousy behind clich√© remarks. Moreover, I think she was still irritated because she had seen that I had spent the holidays with my girlfriend at the time. She came up to me to scold me for making too much noise on the machines. :)))

Her reaction struck me as hilarious, and I wanted to shake her and tell her everything I felt for her.

So, I approached her directly. She wasn‚Äôt expecting that. I went to her desk at the gym and told her that I really didn‚Äôt understand what she wanted, and if she wanted to talk to me, she should do it genuinely‚Äînot make up pathetic excuses for conversations and reasons to argue. I also said that I‚Äôm open to having a conversation, but only if it‚Äôs based on authenticity and honesty. She was speechless. She couldn‚Äôt believe I was so real, so direct. I could see the surprise in her eyes.

Although that moment was problematic, it seemed like her entire behavior changed afterward. Instead of pushing us apart, that moment brought us closer.

I was still blocked on Instagram, but she started posting various stories and posts about our situation on her profile. Of course, she didn‚Äôt do it directly. She would put suggestive songs for each moment between us, videos, and memes that perfectly expressed the events we were going through. I managed to see all of this through websites that let you view Instagram stories anonymously. At first, it seemed silly and childish to me, but then I realized that‚Äôs how she communicated‚Äîindirectly, where she felt comfortable.

As an experiment, I also started posting stories and posts about our situation on Instagram to see if she was following my profile. Soon, she started responding indirectly to absolutely everything I posted. A sign that, yes, it was as I suspected‚Äîshe was also watching my posts and stories through anonymous sites.

I started posting pictures of my favorite food. In response, she would post stories with the same food she made at home. Everything unfolded like a tennis match of love. Subtly, with a lot of emotion, a sense of complicity, and affection.

Then, I noticed at the gym that she started copying my movements, even though it‚Äôs worth mentioning that I am a beginner at the gym‚Äîor at least I was‚Äîbecause in the meantime, I lost 28 kg and went 4-5 times a week consistently, becoming a regular client.

And here we are now, in the present moment, where it often seems to me that she wants closeness between us but doesn‚Äôt know exactly how to achieve it.

On Women‚Äôs Day, she gave me a rose. It was the gym's policy to offer each woman a rose on this occasion, even so her hand was shaking badly when she handed me the flower and she wanted to appear brave. I would have loved to gently caress her right then and there and kiss her hand, but I know she doesn‚Äôt want that. She wants to appear strong and be treated as a strong woman, for her, revealing her feelings is equivalent to vulnerability. After she gave me the rose, she was so shaken and emotional that she couldn‚Äôt look me in the eyes at all until I left the gym.

I studied her gestures when she gave each of the other clients a flower. ‚ÄúGave‚Äù is a bit of an overstatement, since, unlike the gesture she made toward me, with the others she only congratulated them on Women‚Äôs Day and encouraged them to choose a rose themselves from the bucket.

I often catch her watching me from a distance, both when I'm alone and when I'm around others. If she notices that I've seen her gaze, she gets shy, hides, or pretends to look elsewhere. I find these gestures of hers very endearing, even though they're a bit childish. I also get the impression sometimes that she doesn't allow herself to get close to me, even though her desire is visible.

Moreover, I believe that our whole connection is somewhat inhibited by the environment in which we see each other ‚Äî the gym ‚Äî since that's her workplace, and I know she wants to appear, and truly is, professional in what she does. However, of course, she has already turned me down twice when I suggested we go out.

So, how do you advise me to proceed?

I feel like I‚Äôve fallen in love with her, but her approach to our connection is exhausting me. I‚Äôm not like that. I‚Äôm a balanced and rational person, and I care about her, but I wish this whole game would start to make sense. I no longer have the energy to decipher her insecure and ambiguous behavior, even though I‚Äôm almost certain she‚Äôs fallen in love with me too. But honestly, I have no idea how we can break out of this vicious cycle.

Thank you if you had the patience to read everything until the end.I tried to describe the situation as faithfully as possible so that you could give me some advice. Any piece of advice is welcome, and I trust that you can help me figure out what‚Äôs the best way to move forward.

1lynmi8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxRq23qVE8A,Jonathan Bree - You're So Cool,"V√©ritable ph√©nom√®ne viral, la chanson ""You're So Cool"" a propuls√© le musicien n√©o-z√©landais Jonathan Bree sur le devant de la sc√®ne internationale. Sorti en 2017, le titre et son clip iconique ont fascin√© par leur esth√©tique unique et leur m√©lancolie lancinante, cr√©ant un univers √† la fois familier et √©trangement distant. Voici tout ce qu'il faut savoir sur ce morceau inoubliable.

**Une perle de l'album ""Sleepwalking""**

""You're So Cool"" est le single phare du troisi√®me album solo de Jonathan Bree, intitul√© *Sleepwalking*, paru en 2018. Cet album marque un tournant dans sa carri√®re, affirmant un style de ""crooner pop"" sombre et orchestr√©. Le son de l'album, et de ""You're So Cool"" en particulier, est un m√©lange sophistiqu√© de pop de chambre, de lounge et d'influences des ann√©es 60, souvent d√©crit comme une sorte de ""Dark Disney"". La musique se caract√©rise par des arrangements de cordes luxuriants, des guitares discr√®tes et la voix de baryton profonde et impassible de Bree.

Analyse des paroles : une admiration distante

Les paroles de ""You're So Cool"" d√©peignent une forme d'admiration pour une personne qui semble parfaite, disciplin√©e et ma√Ætresse d'elle-m√™me (""Body so fit, so full of spark / With affirmations as your wall art""). Le narrateur observe cette perfection avec une certaine distance, se pla√ßant dans un r√¥le presque servile (""I play the devoted butler / Morning coffees by the bed"").

Cependant, une tension sous-jacente se d√©gage. La phrase ""while all hard fought endeavours bring in diminished returns"" (""tandis que tous les efforts acharn√©s n'apportent que des rendements d√©croissants"") sugg√®re une critique subtile de cette qu√™te de perfection. La froideur du titre, ""You're So Cool"" (""Tu es si cool""), peut √™tre interpr√©t√©e √† la fois comme un compliment sinc√®re et comme le constat d'une distance √©motionnelle infranchissable.

**Le clip : une esth√©tique iconique et d√©rangeante**

Le succ√®s mondial de la chanson est indissociable de son clip vid√©o, r√©alis√© par Jonathan Bree lui-m√™me. Tourn√© en noir et blanc, il pr√©sente le chanteur et son groupe sur une sc√®ne d'inspiration vintage, rappelant les √©missions de t√©l√©vision des ann√©es 60.

L'√©l√©ment le plus marquant est que tous les musiciens, y compris Bree, ont le visage enti√®rement couvert d'un masque de spandex blanc, sans aucune expression. Seules leurs bouches sont visibles lorsqu'ils chantent. Cette d√©personnalisation cr√©e une atmosph√®re √©trange et hypnotique. Les chor√©graphies minimalistes et la fixit√© des regards (inexistants) contrastent avec la richesse orchestrale de la musique, provoquant un sentiment de d√©calage fascinant qui a captiv√© des millions d'internautes sur YouTube.

**Le myst√®re du masque : la signature de l'artiste**

L'utilisation des masques n'est pas un simple artifice de clip. C'est devenu la signature sc√©nique de Jonathan Bree. Dans une interview, il explique que l'id√©e lui est venue pour un projet ant√©rieur et qu'il a d√©cid√© de la r√©utiliser pour ""You're So Cool"". Depuis, le port du masque est devenu une r√®gle.

Cette approche lui permet de mettre la musique au premier plan et de cr√©er une aura de myst√®re. En effa√ßant son identit√© et ses expressions, il offre au public une toile blanche sur laquelle projeter ses propres √©motions, renfor√ßant ainsi le caract√®re universel et intemporel de ses chansons. Le masque agit comme un filtre, accentuant le sentiment de m√©lancolie et de d√©tachement qui est au c≈ìur de sa musique.",1,1752394565.0,actumusique,0,1.0,False
