I went from an XL/XXL to a small/medium. I thought I’d tell you about my experience which might be helpful for anyone but especially those who did not start out at a super high weight.
For reference, I’m 5’4, was 218lbs and am now at 136.



Fluids: 
Drinking enough was impossible. I struggled for at least 2 months and was hospitalized once for exhaustion and dehydration. I just couldn’t drink enough while also eating 6 small meals, plus vitamins and all the other pills. Don’t worry too much. It’ll be better soon! I now can drink a normal glass of water in a normal time frame and can even gulp down some. I also drink carbonated drinks all the time, from a straw. They are not worried about that, it is not prohibited at all in my program but make sure you follow yours. 
I’ve also had alcohol 3 or 4 times. While you do get buzzed really quickly, at least for me, it disappears just as fast. I guess for people who have a tendency to like being drunk, this will cause you to drink way too much, so do proceed with caution.

I’m also good with coffee, it doesn’t cause any discomfort or dumping. 


Food:
I was on puréed food for about 3 days before moving onto soft foods. After 6 weeks, I was allowed to have everything, except fatty foods and sugar. I still stay away from sugar completely. I have tried a small piece of chocolate and that was fine but I just don’t want to push my luck. Sugar has always been my addiction and I’m glad to have a reason to steer clear from it. 

I have also not had fried foods, except one time I had fried cauliflower with lots of protein and it was fine but ymmv. I can eat some chips and can eat popcorn but I’m only allowing myself a small portion as long as my weight is still in a good range. 



I know for some of you, some of this would go against your program. I am following mine and the doctors are in incredibly happy with my progress, saying that I’m about a year ahead of my goals. Crazy!



Dumping:
I do get late dumping occasionally and have not figured out what it is that causes it. I start shaking badly, cannot concentrate and get absolutely ravenous. Standing and walking becomes difficult and it takes about 30min to subside. I think im supposed to eat some sugar and then some carbs or proteins, but I just eat some weetabix with milk or a high protein pudding and it always helps. 
It IS very uncomfortable and I’ve been lucky that it always happened before bedtime. Would it happen at work or while driving, it would be a much more serious story. 

Once, I did throw up (it has become almost impossible to puke) because I ate eggs and bread for breakfast and I guess it was too much. As soon as I puked, I was completely fine. 


Other symptoms: 
Eating too quickly and slightly too much causes incredible stomach pain. The pain that makes you curl up into a ball. Take your time with your food.

I also get early morning sickness. I can only eat very little in the morning and need a big break before drinking anything, including coffee. I don’t know why.

TAKE YOUR IRON SUPPLEMENTS AND YOUR VITAMINS! I am terrible at taking them and am already seeing the consequences. I’m anemic now and really tired because of it.


I had quite the hair loss, starting 4/5 months in. It has now stopped and I have a lot of baby hairs but it will take at least a year to go back to normal I think. It does and did impact my confidence more than I thought. 



Non-scale observations/victories: 
I’ve been smallish before so this isn’t new but people absolutely do treat you better. You become way more visible and for me, men have started to look my way (yay) or stare (ew). I have more success in dating and I can go clothes shopping at any store! 

I have cheekbones, can feel my hips and ribs! 

My heart does not pound anymore and I can actually pull my leg up to tie my shoes.

We have 2 kids together. We've mostly been happy aside from a  mismatched sex drive, but have worked through it.
We don't have many friends that we spend time with. We are both pretty introverted and also have some childhood trauma that  sometimes makes it t hard to trust people.He has never had close male friends, or female fwiw. I have a few girl friends that I see maybe once every few months. He has been my best friend for years. 
Enter Jane. They met at work and we also have mutual friends, and now our kids go to school together. 
Today, my husband told me he was feeling a bit restless and wanted to go out for a bit. He would normally ask me to go with but didn't today saying he just needed to get out of the house. I didn't push it, it's not totally unusual for him to go out for an hour or so and do some thrifting or shopping. 
After an hour or more, I was concerned since he's normally not gone that long. I looked at our tracking app and noticed he's been at the same location for the entire hour +.  I texted him to just check that he was ok and he replied saying he was shopping and decided to stop for coffee. This was super unlike him. He NEVER gets coffee at a shop. So I looked again and realized he was indeed at a cafe in a shopping center. I texted him again and asked him if he was at said cafe and why didn't he ask me and the kids to meet him there as we had recently talked about going to this place. He was immediately defensive. Then started to head home. When he got here, he could tell I was confused and after a few back and forths admitted he was with Jane, just the two of them, and that he had lied to me about it. 
He insists that they are 100% just friends, and that he lied to me because he knew I would react badly. He's going through some shit and explained he just needs a friend, he said.
I want to be the bigger person and be okay with it, but I just can't. She is younger and pretty and his type exactly. I used to be her! I can't be okay with it. I told him as much. He is pretty upset about it. He said he understands where I'm coming from, but he's got so much unresolved trauma, it's difficult for him to make friends so when he meets someone he wants to be friends with, I should understand. 
I feel like something has broken between, mostly because he was so sweet to me while lying right to my face before he went out with her. I don't know if I can trust him again.

I'm working on a kiosk/Point of Purchase setup for a coffee shop, and I want it to double as a case study for design and UX. To make it special, I've brought on board some talented 3D artists, designers, and developers to create a truly standout POS system.

Currently, the kiosk is built around a Raspberry Pi, which has been great for prototyping and keeping things compact. However, I’m open to scaling up to a more robust hardware setup if needed to ensure the best possible performance and experience.

To showcase our work effectively, I’m looking for a high-quality 4K touchscreen monitor. It should have excellent touch sensitivity, great color accuracy, and durability to handle the environment of a coffee shop.

Does anyone have recommendations for reliable 4K touch monitors that would fit this use case?

One thing that I see gets asked here a fair bit is people wondering where to go out to when dressed. Whilst I know that my dressing circumstances are very good - I am open and comfortable about crossdressing in public and with family and friends - I thought it might be interesting to track what I did on each of the 36 days I dressed last year. I aim to dress, on average, every ten days, and make a point of going out somewhere when I do. Sometimes that's just a morning coffee and some lunchtime shopping. Sometimes it's a more ambitious expedition.

I hope it provides a little inspiration.

I have included a mosaic of selected photos from the year :)

One cultural disconnect that I'm hoping someone can help me understand is the view of coffee.

The detective (Fox?) makes a snarky comment to Avi that his coffee is ready, implying that Avi isn't a true scholar.

Location: Downtown Waco, TX

Was in the car with my wife and son on the way to pick up some coffee at night like normal people. I was stopped at a red light chatting with my wife when we both trailed off our thoughts, because lights in the sky caught our attention. 

I'm used to seeing aircraft but something about this caught both our attentions. Both the speed at which it was moving and the altitude it was at stood out to me. The speed seemed comparable to a plane coming in to land and so was it's trajectory as it had a slight descent. It seemed unusually low for where it was operating, low enough that I lost sight of it behind a building at the red light. It did move in a straight path.

Another oddity were the lights. Only a white and green light where visible (to my memory no strobing, but my wife wasnt sure). At the angle we were looking at it we should have seen all three lights, white, red and green. There is an airport in the area, but the UFO was moving south east towards Baylor, and the airport was in the opposite direction towards the north west. To be descending in a city towards a university, I don't know what to think but odd.

Once my wife and I had time to comprehended what we were seeing (around 10 seconds), as we both thought it odd, I asked her to try to take a picture. It went behind some buildings and just then my light turned green. I drove around for a bit and never saw it again, although it's lights were bright.

The reason I'm posting this is because I hope some of yall will be able to give me info on drone models that would have the white and green lights (as I think this is the most likely outcome).

My favorite makeup products are lipsticks. So here's my question: is it common knowledge that you can just make lipsticks darker by adding a darker lip liner?? For example, I purchased Revlon's Super Lustrious Lipstick in ""Coffee Bean"" (light brown on me) and I was torn on whether I should also buy the ""Iced Mocha"" (dark brown) shade as well. Until it dawned on me that I could just use a dark brown lip liner (still learning about those) to turn Coffee Bean into Iced Mocha!! I'm of a light cool completion, so it doesn't take much to make a color difference on me. Is this obvious to people? Am I just late to the sleepover?? I know color theory is important to consider, but it still makes the lipstick darker, no?

I also know that people love makeup.. and I love it too! But.. why do people buy 20 lipsticks in the same shade range when they can just use a darker liner to achieve very similar results?? Please don't misunderstand, I'm not hating at all!! I'm just genally curious because I see a bunch of posts of people all having the same shades of lipstick but in different brands. (blushes too). I have some similar shades, but only in different formulas like mattes vs. lipgloss. So having 20 pink mattes when you can use a lip liner to darken seems a bit redundant to me. Shouldn't I just buy only lighter shades, because I can always go darker by using a cheap liner (e.g., LA Color)? Am I missing something here?

Sorry if this was a little too long! I like context lol. Thanks to anyone to who can help clarify this for me! I appreciate you! 🙏🏻😊",1,1736135953.0,drugstoreMUA,1,1.0,False

Explaining what a fashion authenticator does is neither here nor there. What happened after that moment, however, is the real story—the juicy details I feel compelled to spill.

There have been moments in my life when emotions built up, thickened to the point where a simple gasp of air felt like a blessed gift. That tightness in your throat—the knot right at the center—suddenly releases, like a balloon popping or a firework exploding, blooming the night sky with sparkles.

I had yearned for the day I’d be relieved from my role as a fashion authenticator. Yet when it finally happened, a new challenge arose: Who am I… now?

Who am I… now?
It’s a question I asked myself over and over, sitting in my one-bedroom apartment, staring at the walls, trying to piece together what came next.

Suddenly, I was a free agent, looking for my next gig—but this time, there were non-negotiables: I wanted protection. A union, and most definitely, a pension. I wanted work that felt purposeful, something where I could contribute to the community and find fulfillment.

I wrote it down on a sticky note: Purpose. Union. Pension. Community.

It didn’t happen overnight, but in time—about a year and some change—it came.

During those in-between months, I made a decision to take full advantage of my free time. I created a simple mantra: “Do it, even if you’re scared.”

This rule became my guiding light, propelling me forward when fear threatened to hold me back. It was as though someone heard my quiet whispers, and suddenly, the net appeared beneath me.

Opportunities started to surface—calculated ones. Thanks to my loved ones and those who believed in me, I found myself hosting yoga classes, appearing in commercials, and checking off long-standing goals on my bucket list.

All of this, while still searching for my next chapter. It was liberating. It was insightful. And then, I stumbled upon an advertisement for a teaching opportunity.
At that point, I wasn’t desperate, but I was open. Open to seeing what might stick if I threw it against the wall. As I read the description of the job, something clicked. It felt aligned with my long-term goals.

Everything happened at light speed after that. Is it cliché to say I felt like I’d been preparing for this moment? Just months earlier, I had been scared—but willing to move forward through the unknown. Now, it was as though the lessons I’d tucked away and protected were being put to the test.

The interview came. The offer letter followed.
And now, a few months into this new chapter, I’m uncovering a deeper layer of myself. I’ve come to appreciate the beauty in difficulty—the cyclical waves of emotion and the ongoing work of regulating my nervous system as an educator. Somehow, through all of it, I’ve managed to keep doing the things that bring me joy.

The intention behind creating this space on Substack grew out of my personal experiences over the past year and my nostalgia for the early days of blogging. I’ve carried these thoughts and ideas for a long time, and now it feels right to let them see the light of day.

This is a home for personal reflections from an Afro-Puerto Rican perspective—centered on culture and community. I have things on my chest, and with my coffee in hand and my laptop on the kitchen table, I’m ready to share.

Thank you for your eyes, your time, and your presence here. It isn’t taken for granted.",1,1736135794.0,u_biggbabykayy,0,1.0,False

Location: Downtown Waco, TX

Was in the car with my wife and son on the way to pick up some coffee at night like normal people. I was stopped at a red light chatting with my wife when we both trailed off our thoughts, because lights in the sky caught our attention. 

I'm used to seeing aircraft but something about this caught both our attentions. Both the speed at which it was moving and the altitude it was at stood out to me. The speed seemed comparable to a plane coming in to land and so was it's trajectory as it had a slight descent. It seemed unusually low for where it was operating, low enough that I lost sight of it behind a building at the red light. It did move in a straight path.

Another oddity were the lights. Only a white and green light where visible (to my memory no strobing, but my wife wasnt sure). At the angle we were looking at it we should have seen all three lights, white, red and green. There is an airport in the area, but the UFO was moving south east towards Baylor, and the airport was in the opposite direction towards the north west. To be descending in a city towards a university, I don't know what to think but odd.

Once my wife and I had time to comprehended what we were seeing (around 10 seconds), as we both thought it odd, I asked her to try to take a picture. It went behind some buildings and just then my light turned green. I drove around for a bit and never saw it again, although it's lights were bright.

The reason I'm posting this is because I hope some of yall will be able to give me info on drone models that would have the white and green lights (as I think this is the most likely outcome).

1huq6jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tipstor/comments/1huq6jo/from_soggy_bird_to_crispy_perfection/,“From Soggy Bird To Crispy Perfection”,"Some kitchen habits stick around like that one piece of Tupperware you’ve lost the lid to — you don’t notice how bad they are until someone points them out. For me, it started with French press coffee grounds. I thought nothing of dumping those soggy remnants straight down the sink drain until one fateful day when my roommate looked on in sheer, unfiltered horror. “What are you doing?” they gasped, as though I’d just admitted to microwaving fish in the office breakroom. I didn’t realize I was practically hand-crafting a plumbing nightmare. Apparently, coffee grounds and pipes are mortal enemies. Who knew? Certainly not me. At least not back then.

Then there were my early culinary triumphs — or disasters, depending on how generous you’re feeling. Post-sear pans? Oh, those went straight into the sink, crusty bits and all. A seasoned cook would’ve looked at that fond — the caramelized treasure stuck to the pan — and seen a three-minute sauce just waiting to happen. Not me. I saw it as “extra scrubbing” and happily drowned it in soapy water, blissfully unaware I was washing away flavor gold. It’s like tossing a twenty-dollar bill in the trash and thinking, “Eh, who needs it?”

And roast chicken? Oh, roast chicken and I had a rocky start. Back then, I treated it like an overly hydrated sponge. I’d rinse it under the tap like I was giving it a quick spa treatment, completely oblivious to the fact that I was practically inviting bacteria to a pool party in my kitchen sink. I thought rinsing was a rite of passage, a ceremonial cleanse to make the bird somehow “better.” Turns out, the only thing it did was set me up for soggy chicken skin — a crime against dinner itself.

But wait, it gets worse. Did I pat the bird dry before shoving it into the oven? Of course not. Why would I? I assumed the oven was some kind of magical desert oasis that would zap all that excess moisture away. Instead, I’d pull out a pale, limp-skinned chicken that looked like it had been sitting in a steam room for hours. Meanwhile, I’d be in denial, carving it up and saying things like, “At least it’s juicy,” as everyone politely avoided eye contact with their plates.

I’m happy to report I’ve since learned the error of my ways. The French press grounds now go into the compost bin, where they belong. My post-sear pans? Deglazed like they’re auditioning for a saucy cooking show. And roast chicken? Oh, you better believe it’s dry as a bone before it ever gets near the oven. That bird gets patted down like it’s going through airport security, all in the name of crisp, golden perfection.

Looking back, I cringe at my former kitchen self — the one who didn’t know better and thought “good enough” was an acceptable standard. But hey, we’ve all got to start somewhere, right? And if my mistakes can serve as a cautionary tale for someone else, well, then maybe they weren’t so bad after all. Or at least, that’s what I tell myself to sleep at night.

Spoiler alert: it’s both rewarding and exhausting. My brain is powered by a potent mix of ideas, existential crises, and just enough caffeine to keep me teetering on the edge of enlightenment - or a nervous breakdown, depending on the day.



I’ve been scribbling letters since I was six , mostly to my grandmother, bless her patience, and occasionally attempting to send her postcards… without stamps, naturally. (Turns out, the postal service doesn’t appreciate my creativity.) Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of forging some amazing connections, most of which I’ve had to let go. Not for dramatic reasons, mind you - just your garden-variety “it’s not you, it’s me” scenarios.



Lately, I’ve been toying with the idea of picking up the pen again, but procrastination is my middle name. Today, however, I finally decided to make good on that thought.I’m absolutely thrilled to meet you, well, not “meet” in the literal sense because, you know, letters...but close enough!

Sometimes it’s a culinary masterpiece; other times, even my dog looks concerned.



Rainy days are my love language. Give me a cup of tea, a slightly obscure book that makes me question my existence, and the sound of raindrops, and I’m in heaven. Bonus points if I can curl up in a blanket and pretend the outside world doesn’t exist. Bliss. But don’t worry, I’m not just a brooding intellectual; I’m also surprisingly fun. Like, “philosophical debates over pizza and bad puns” kind of fun.



I’m all about connecting with people, especially those who can tolerate my quirky humor and occasional deep dives into why we’re all here (or why pineapple on pizza is a crime against humanity). Fair warning: I laugh way too hard at my own jokes and will absolutely judge your food seasoning skills.

Teeth whitening can be a game-changing cosmetic procedure that transforms your smile, but what happens when you accidentally slip up and enjoy your favorite coffee right after the treatment? Don't panic! Many people find themselves in this exact situation, wondering about potential consequences and next steps. Whether you're a coffee lover who couldn't resist your morning brew or accidentally forgot about post-whitening care instructions, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know about accidentally drinking coffee after teeth whitening.

Understanding the Risks of Drinking Coffee After Teeth Whitening

When you've just completed a teeth whitening treatment, your tooth enamel becomes temporarily more porous and susceptible to staining. The whitening process opens up the pores in your teeth, making them more vulnerable to discoloration from dark-colored beverages like coffee, tea, and red wine.

Immediate Consequences of Drinking Coffee After Whitening

If you've accidentally consumed coffee shortly after teeth whitening, you might experience:

- Potential immediate staining
- Increased tooth sensitivity
- Reduced effectiveness of the whitening treatment
- Temporary discoloration of the tooth surface

How Long Should You Avoid Coffee After Teeth Whitening?

Dental professionals typically recommend avoiding coffee for at least 48 hours after your whitening treatment. During this critical period, your teeth are most vulnerable to staining and discoloration. **The first 24-48 hours are crucial for maintaining your bright, white smile.**

Steps to Minimize Damage After Accidentally Drinking Coffee

1. Rinse Your Mouth Immediately
Quickly rinse your mouth with water to minimize potential staining. This helps remove coffee residue and reduces the risk of significant discoloration.

2. Use a Straw
If you must drink coffee, use a straw positioned toward the back of your mouth to minimize contact with your newly whitened teeth.

3. Practice Good Oral Hygiene
Gently brush your teeth after rinsing, using a soft-bristled toothbrush to avoid additional sensitivity.

Potential Long-Term Effects

While an accidental sip of coffee won't completely ruin your teeth whitening results, repeated exposure can compromise the treatment's effectiveness. Some potential long-term effects include:

- Uneven whitening
- Faster discoloration
- Reduced treatment longevity

I am in my late 20s and have started my spiritual journey this past year. I was raised catholic but at an early age realized it was not my spiritual calling. After much studying and research and growth I stumbled through a friend into Cuban lukumi; which strongly resonated with me as I am black but very distanced from my lineage and culture.

Reclaiming culture and believes that were lost at some point in my bloodline is something that is really important to me. I have learned quite a bit, of what I am permitted to know, since I am not initiated in any kind of way. 

I have though started to work on taking care of my ancestors, offering them water, flowers, rum, coffee and candles often. As I truly want to connect and honor those who paved the way for me to be here and watch and guide me through this life.

Through more research and study I have found Isese, which I am most intrigued about. 

Mainly I would like advice on two things:
1- What are some reputable resources I can reference to learn more about Isese as a way of living?

2- How may I feed and grow my Ori and pray to it?",1,1736135012.0,Isese,0,1.0,False

Now, after all this time, I need to share his story. People may be in danger, including myself. Or perhaps I'm freaking out over nothing. I hope so.

When we first met, I had Isaac write down his version of events in as much detail as possible. What follows is his account.

\-

About five months ago, I woke up one morning with a persistent itch under my right eye. When I looked in the mirror, I found a red mark on my eyelid and thought maybe I’d scratched myself during one of my stress dreams. I didn’t think much of it, but then it started to look infected. Every day for weeks I would take stock of the blemish in the mirror; every day it would get nastier. Kept telling myself it would probably heal on its own while it grew into a yellowish lump the size of a grape. Looked at all kinds of horrors on WebMD, but I couldn’t figure out what it was. I felt it when I blinked.

That’s when business started to dry up. I’d been flipping cars on Craigslist with my buddy Lucas. He had the mechanical know-how and handled logistics, while I’d go out and work my charm, make deals. It’s important not to look like a skeezebag in that line of work and suddenly I couldn’t unload this Nissan Altima on anybody. People looked at me different. Got skittish.

Lucas stopped returning my texts. The gall of the man. He lived in the apartment directly below mine. I could hear his life: his shouting matches with his girlfriend Polly, his toddler Ophelia throwing fits, his Doberman barking at nothing. We would have a relationship whether he liked it or not.

Even the old, gray cat stopped coming around. I called him Gravy. He was a long-haired fella that would waltz into my place through the window above the fire escape. I lived on the 4^(th) floor. I’d feed him licks of vanilla ice cream during that sweltering summer. He probably belonged to somebody. I had to wonder if he stopped returning because of my face.

And yeah, I must admit, I was nearly dead broke after making a few bad bets on DraftKings. Couldn’t make rent or my phone bill. So that’s why I never made a doctor’s appointment. Knew in the back of my mind that if things got desperate, I would have to go to the pawn shop to loan my prized Rolex. Again. It was my only real asset. I slept with it on.

And finally, the wasp appeared. It got stuck inside the dome of the light fixture above my bed. Didn’t know that was possible. With the light on, I could see it’s body in silhouette, it’s big ass stinger. It bounced around, tapping the glass when I tried to sleep. And that was the night I started to lose it. Like goddamn, why me? There’s always some bullshit. Can’t catch a goddamn break. All these little indignities had piled up and now I had this wellspring of venom spilling out of me. Paced around cursing, checking the mirror over and over, looking at my ugly mug, rapping my knuckles on my head, turning the light on and off, watching the wasp crawl in its cage.

The next morning, I went to Lucas’s to confront him. The dog went nuts as soon as I knocked, and when Lucas answered with Ophelia on his hip, she started scream-crying at the sight of me.

Polly dragged the dog and kid away and I was pissed. And when I get pissed, I get to ranting, and I ranted about all this stuff—the wasp, the cat, his dog, my face, him ghosting me, DraftKings—and the whole time he couldn’t look me in the eye. He constantly sniffled and rubbed his nose, this nervous tick—made him look pathetic. I couldn’t fathom how he’d get along without me.

To my surprise, he cut me off and said, “Isaac, I’m not giving you money, man. And you know why.”

He knew I would ask. Then he looked at my blemish and his expression flickered. Seemed he was cycling through several emotions. I read them as queasiness, worry, and then contempt.

He sniffed and said, “I can see you’re in trouble. Go see Sylvia in 205. She’ll help.”

No other explanation. He shut the door in my stunned face.

Well, I assumed it was about my skin problem, and he just didn’t want to say it. So, I moseyed down to 205, knocked, and this tiny, wrinkled woman, maybe 80 years old, let me in. She was a hoarder. The place was cluttered with potted plants, newspapers, and all kinds of knick-knacks and pieces of junk. I remember lamps made from blown glass. Jewelry and letters strewn on the coffee table along with a fancy letter opener. A metal ring puzzle. Family photos and abstract paintings covering the walls from floor to ceiling. A bowling trophy. A marble bust. Fine China displayed in a cabinet. A PhD placard for folklore studies. A dog bone. A dreamcatcher in the window.

She shuffled over and sat cross-legged on the floor. By the way she dressed, wearing this red, silky robe thing and feather earrings, she seemed a bit new-agey. I figured she’d give me a salve made from tree bark or some shit. When you’re in a crisis, you start to look everywhere for a solution, even towards mumbo jumbo. But she didn’t say a thing for the longest time, so I filled the dead air with my rant again.

She finally said in her croaky old woman voice, “give me the wasp.”

“What do you mean?”

“Give me the wasp.”

We stared at each other for a long moment. It seemed like her eyes pointed in two different directions, just slightly.

“I thought you would help with my whole facial issue,” I said. 

“Give me the wasp.”

I couldn’t pry anything else out of her. She just repeated it over and over, and I was fuming, like is this a joke? Does she have dementia? Eventually, I zipped out of there and my spite carried me back to my apartment. I unscrewed the light fixture and after stalking it for two minutes, captured the wasp in a Tupperware container. Then I returned to old Sylvia.

She didn’t say shit as I brandished the container at her. So, I opened it. Let the wasp float out into her place.

“There’s your wasp.”

No reaction. She only stared at me. Not so much as a shadow of an expression. I left with my fury peaking and simmering down into this cold nothing.

A day later, I went out to the pawnshop to loan out my precious watch. But when a got to the parking lot, I spotted a glint on the pavement—a diamond ring. I hurried and pawned it for $800. Later, I won $1000 on DraftKings. And over the next couple days the gnarly spot on my face began to clear up.  It receded back into a small red dot, though it still itched a bit. I paid rent and sold the Nissan. Couldn’t help but connect my strange interaction with Sylvia to my turn of luck.

I enjoyed a week of normalcy before the spot returned with a vengeance. But not a lump this time. It quickly spread out into a flat, yellow-brown splotch, like a bruise on an apple. One morning I poked the flesh with my pinky, and I can only describe it now as *too soft*. My finger left an impression that lingered like memory foam. Almost threw up right then. Decided to go to urgent care. But my keys were missing. In a nauseous panic, I tore up my whole apartment, my closet, my dresser, and the furniture. What did I find? One: a couple of mysterious blood stains on the carpet that I’d never noticed before—small and round. Two: Fat cockroaches in the couch cushions.

And I thought of Sylvia, sitting there in the corner of my mind, expressionless. Couldn’t dislodge her. I thought maybe I would apologize for the wasp… to cover my bases. Realign my karma. I was a bit dizzy. I clenched my teeth and went down to apartment 205. Again, she let me in and sat on the rug; again, I filled the silence, rambling about my problems.

She said, “bring me the cockroaches.”

“What’s your deal?”

“Bring me the cockroaches.”

“Are you all right?” I raised my voice at her.

“Bring me the cockroaches.”

And on and on.

What can I say? They were harder to capture than the wasp, but I corralled two cockroaches in the Tupperware container and returned to Sylvia. This time, I knelt, sort of bowed to her, and placed the container at her feet. Thought I was making peace with her. Caught a whiff of her—earthy. She had fuzz on her upper lip, liver spots. She breathed long and deep through her nose. Had this reptilian stillness. Her eyes—just a bit bloodshot in the corners—they followed my movements, but only after a short delay. Like when I stood back up, they looked into the empty space before flicking up at me. Didn’t blink. It occurred to me that she was in some kind of meditative state. 

I walked to the door and when I turned to say goodbye, her mouth hung open, yellow teeth on display, a glisten on her lips, maybe saliva. At this point, this dread congealed in me. Left feeling weak.

I decided to walk the 4 miles to urgent care. Clear my head and get some fresh air. By the time anybody would see me they looked at me like I was a moron because the thing on my face had gone back to a somewhat normal color and reduced dramatically in size. Looked like a standard bruise. They told me to see a dermatologist.

And over the next few weeks, I watched the blemish shrink back into a red speck. Almost didn’t want it to happen because…it just wasn’t normal. I was stuck in this psychedelic headspace, checking the mirror every two minutes. After staring into the mirror for a while my vision would go blurry and I’d think it was there again. I couldn’t bottle my nerves.

One evening I went over and knocked on Lucas’s door, but he wouldn’t answer.

Started slamming on his door and yelling, “What’s with Sylvia, bro? Answer me.” No response, but I heard Ophelia crying, so I knew he was there.  

I banged on the door, hard. “Some weird shit’s going on and I’m not having it anymore.” I stood there listening for a long while. Once Ophelia stopped crying there was silence.

I won something like $4,000 on the sportsbook apps. Never found my keys. And the roach infestation was gone.

The whole time slack-jawed Sylvia was there in the back of my mind watching my life. Had an appointment with a dermatologist scheduled in a couple goddamn months. I prayed to God that this was just a weird episode, and things could go back to normal.

No. A few days later, I woke up at 3:00am with my face itching. Something smelled like sweaty feet and my skin was wet. Checked the mirror, and my stomach dropped. Pus leaked out this wound, a hole in my eyelid. And, I thought, maybe, I could see a bit of white. The white of my eyeball through the hole.

I puked into the sink. Turned away spitting, couldn’t look at it again. It was my face. I was losing my mind. I wanted to go back to urgent care, but I couldn’t find my phone or shoes. Looked everywhere.

Ran out of the apartment in a panic. Started knocking on doors.

“I need help.” Yelling, moaning. “Someone call me an ambulance.” Nobody answered. Knocked on all the doors on my floor. “Where the fuck is everybody?” Not a peep.

Went back into my apartment and slumped onto the couch. Noticed drops of dried blood scattered all over the carpet. Sat for a long time waiting for something to happen. Maybe for the police to show up. Tried to calm down. Tried to tell myself that I wasn’t dying. Went to the fridge, but my damn ice cream was missing. Blood drops on the linoleum, too. Grabbed a bottle of Jameson and drank until I got really tired. This confusion hit me. Dissociative. Almost didn’t know where I was. Heart went crazy. There’s nothing else like it, the feeling that you’re having a psychotic break. It’s damnation.

Sylvia was out there, watching me through the cement and drywall. This rage, directed at her, started building in me. Rage was better than the confusion. I Prowled around, bouncing off the walls until the inertia propelled me out the door. I took the bottle with me down to 205.

Banged on her door. When Sylvia opened it, I raved at her. I said that I wanted out. No more. Demanded she give my shoes back. I think I threatened to, you know, kill her.

She didn’t flinch. Just shuffled back to her spot on the carpet and said something I couldn’t hear. So, I stepped closer, into the apartment. The place smelled like cooked porkchops.

“Give me the watch.”

I hesitated.

“Give me the watch.”

I realized then I was a coward. I guess I sort of always knew in the back of my head.

“Please, just leave me the hell alone.” I flung the Rolex into her lap and left. Stumbled back to my apartment and drank until I fell asleep.

Spent maybe four weeks, the longest period yet, watching the thing heal. The hole disappeared and the blemish shrank down into the red dot. But it still itched. I still didn’t have my phone, shoes, or keys. I only left my apartment to go to the corner store to buy ice cream, Oreos, Jameson, and like a thousand scratchers. Won nearly $10,000. Counted the days until my dermatologist appointment.

Woke up one morning to the smell of rot. Gathered my courage to look in the mirror. The bottom half of my eye was exposed. Lower eyelid gone, with the area around it necrotic black. My first reaction was to put my hand over it, because I thought it would fall out. I felt the wetness and I fainted.

When I came to, I crawled into the living room. Gravy the cat stood perched on the fire escape. I coaxed him into my arms with a spoonful of ice cream. He purred and I wept as I cradled him. Soft friendly guy. 

Sylvia was out there in her apartment, as still as a lizard, watching me. And I knew she was saying, “bring me the cat.”

I went slow. Could barely walk straight. Took the stairs one at time and thought, like, oh God, what will happen to Gravy when I give him to Sylvia? Every step I would pause and think about turning back, but I kept going, I had no other choice. I needed to save my face. Fought to stay upright, scratching Gravy’s chin, telling him I was sorry, until I reached the landing and turned the corner. I saw something and crept back.

Down the hall, Lucas held little Ophelia outside apartment 205. Polly’s little girl Ophelia. 4 years old. Lucas knocked on the door and entered.  

I padded down the hall with Gravy still in my arms. Pressed my ear to the door. A muffled voice. A long pause. I stood behind the door when it opened again. Lucas stepped out, without Ophelia, and turned to find me. We both said something like *oh shit.*

His nose was bleeding. He held his hand up to it, but couldn’t stop the flow down his lips. The blood had dyed his mustache and beard completely red, like a lioness’s fur after feeding. Blood dripped off his chin onto the carpet.

I stared until it hit me. The blood.

“Have you been in my apartment?” I asked.

He doubled over in laughter. Sounded like hiccups. *Hic Hic Hic.* Blood fell onto the floor in spurts.

He coughed out, “Sylvia… wanted your ice cream,” and laughed some more.

I pivoted into the apartment. Sylvia sat on the floor with Ophelia in her lap. A string of drool dangled from her mouth onto Ophelia’s hair, but Ophelia was oblivious, playing with the metal ring puzzle. Sylvia's eyes looked up to me. She placed Ophelia on the ground and stood. She took the letter opener and pulled it from its sheathe, revealing a black blade. With her right hand, she held the blade aloft; with her left hand, she touched Ophelia's head.

I threw Gravy at Sylvia. He landed claws-first on her head. As Gravy raced down her back, his claws made this popping sound, tearing through her skin, but she barely reacted, moving her hands slowly, trying to catch him. I ran and grabbed Ophelia like a football. Sylvia tumbled over as I shoulder checked her on my way to the window. I lunged out the window and onto the fire escape.

All the way down, I begged little Ophelia to take her mom and escape, leave Lucas, leave the apartment.

“Please do you understand?” I asked her, but she beat on me with her little hands.

I guess my face looked normal by the time the cops caught up with me several hours later.

\-

And Isaac looked normal by the time I came to see him. He was charged with kidnapping. After reading his tale, my first thought was that he obviously made up the whole thing in a stupid attempt to justify his actions. Then, after he assured me he wasn't lying, I thought maybe I would plead insanity for the first time in my career. But his case never made it to trial. Strange things began to happen.

The cops found out that Polly, Lucas’s girlfriend, had gone missing. And before they could figure out what was going on, they found Lucas covered in blood in his bed, expired. The detective in charge mentioned other missing people. When I asked him how many, he wouldn't say. I told him to visit Sylvia in 205. He told me that they had everything handled and to keep my nose out of it. 

Isaac told me that he had money for a better lawyer. He just needed help getting it from the bank. Shortly thereafter, he landed in the hospital. I never heard from him again. They wouldn't divulge the cause of death.

Ophelia ended up with her Aunt and Uncle.

None of the disappearances made the news. I called the detective again at some point. He told me NOT to go to the press. It could ruin the investigation. I thought it was a bogus threat, but I complied anyway. I tried to forget about it and move on. 

Why am I sharing this now? Because… I think I did something stupid. Sylvia. She got stuck in my mind. Lodged in there. I’ve dreamt about her numerous times, even though I’ve never seen her. I had to know if she had anything to do with the disappearances. So, after all this time, about two years, I tracked down the apartment. 

Once I entered the lobby, I knew it was the right place, because I found a bulletin board with an old missing cat poster for Gandalf the long-haired cat. But when I saw it, I was overcome with a sense of dread. I left without visiting 205. I guess I'm a coward.

The day after I visited, I got this big zit on the center of my nose.

Now, I keep telling myself not to worry. But I check the mirror every two minutes.",4,1736134430.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I just want to be thorough. I also never make reddit posts so I apologize if there is a ""guideline"" that I'm not following. 

My friend introduced me to a girl a week ago. We met up at her apartment because my friend was there hanging out with her roommate. When I got there me and the girl talked, even after my friend went home and her roommate went in their room. We talked for a couple more hours and got along really well. Some similar interests, she laughed at my jokes, etc. I asked for her number before I went home and she gave it to me without hesitation (this obviously could have just been her being polite or wanting to make a new friend. Hopefully more, but can't be sure yet)

After that we texted for the rest of the week and the conversations weren't terrible, but they also weren't like... Undeniably full of excitement and interest on her part. It's hard to explain. It's not like she would text back immediately, but it wasn't like she took hours or days to respond. Sometimes it was quick, sometimes it took a little time, but that's understandable because she might be busy at work or busy doing something else. Hell, she might not even be a big phone person. 

I thought about asking her out on the weekend, but I figured I'd just talk to her and wait until the 2nd weekend. But she ended up inviting me over for board games, pizza, and beer. I went, brought her surprise flowers(to try and show that I am interested in more than friends and she loved the flowers), and we had a great time. The next day we played tennis and walked around the park and got coffee. When we were walking around, there wasn't a good opportunity to reach for her hand. Idk if she had her guards up and this was also only in the beginning I kind of stopped looking for an opportunity after I noticed that. So idk if it was like that the entire time. 

Also, I've tried to be a complete gentleman I. E. Open the car door, carry everything, be respectful, etc. 

All of our conversations are full of laughs and smiles. She always sincerely laughs at my jokes. I want to move to forward in pursuing a relationship, but here are some of my concerns... 

1. Maybe once or twice, but as far as texting goes I don't think she's ever initiated. If she takes a long time to respond I never send more than 2 messages and wait for her response to continue. (I don't think this is a super big deal) there is a slight language barrier. 

2. The 2 times we hung out, she has invited her roommate. It's always ended up just the two of us, and she was completely normal, but it's just the fact that she doesn't seem to actively seek out a 1 on 1 situation like I do.

3. She's never initiated physical contact except a goodbye hug. No slight touches on the arm or anything of the sort. And doesn't seem very flirty. 

I want to ask her out for a serious date. I don't want her to think it's just platonic friends simply going out to eat dinner together. I also don't want to rush things and ruin it with bad timing. Are there things I should say? Things I should do? I. E.  Should I tell her directly that I like her and want to pursue something more? How should I ask her out in a way that is obvious that it's a date date?

Growing up in a toxic family dynamic until I turned 27. My “mother” ( let’s call her beast) favoured always my 3 year older brother Felix. Growing up I simply did not understand why my brother got everything served and I had to pay for everything. My room $1500.00, food , phone and laundry extra. It did not help that I grew up high up in the mountains of Switzerland. I had to drive for one hour to work and used a lot of gasoline money to do so. I was not allowed to enter an apprentice of my liking, I had to learn to be a hairdresser. It was hell! I’ve got to know my first boyfriend from Italy when I was 18 years old. Both of my parents called my names at the beginning. Like “ Italian whore” and worse. For the first year my  parents called me all those names. As a hairdresser I was not able to leave my home financially. My parents made sure I couldn’t save any money. Entering the second year I was together with my boyfriend, my parents changed the approach. They absolutely ignored me. Still, I was not able to leave financially, as my boyfriend still lived with his parents as well. 
Eventually he broke off, as my parents made his life hell as well. 
After my relationship I stayed single for a long time. My “beast” told me once out of the blue “ I know why you don’t have a boyfriend!!” I was so baffled and asked why? “ because you’re an asshole ! And walked away. Many different interactions like this happen. When ever I went out for a supper or just a coffee with a man, my “ beast” blasted out that I’m a whore I’m sleeping with every one of them. She started telling everyone I’m sleeping with hundreds of different men. I was not aware of that. I found out later when I was 40 years old. 
With 27 I got to know a nice guy, my parents were livid! Mainly my beast! Very awful things happen to me, until we Immigrated to Canada.   Even here , my beast was able to send her ugly message through a messenger of hers. The Swiss community treated us very bad. 
I’m 50 now, and I just found out everything.

if I receive my entire income from outside of Malta and also keep it in a bank account outside of Malta, I assume it won't be taxed. However, if I understand that correctly the payments for my apartment for example would be taxed 15% .. so if I pay 10.000 Euro rent a year I'd have to pay 1500 Euro in taxes, doesn't matter if it's from a foreign bank account and foreign income source because the money got remitted to Malta?

If that's the case, I'm curious where the line is drawn, I'd assume that electricity bills and internet or vehicle insurance would fall under this, but does this also apply to groceries and just eating at a restaurant when not paying in cash?  
  
Because technically I remitted all this money back to Malta, albeit sourced from foreign income on a foreign bank account. That would sound like a lot of tax-work picking apart the annual credit-card bill and also dampen a lot of the advantages of the tax-status, basically having to run around with cash all the time like a small-time criminal whenever wanting to eat some McDonalds or have a coffee. 

Does anyone have experience with that? I think this should be a question basic enough that it's not for a specialized tax-consultant. ",1,1736133468.0,malta,0,1.0,False

B&W and SEY were in monthly subs AND a bottomless scale for B&W. 
Sampled DAK, Little Wave and some others (local and shipped). Highlight of the year was going to Simple Kaffa flagship shop. 

Favorites:
- Danche, specifically B&W 5 day anerobic washed
- Milky Cake
- Esteban Zamora Cinnamon Anaerobic
- Simple Kaffa - Sidama Arbegona Bursa

Ragrats 
- Little Wave pink bourbon scone kombucha fermentation - went straight to compost
- B&W Future Champagne - ended up with a 12oz and 2lb bag, was rough to finish all of that as we got tired of the flavor quite quickly 
- The House that Built Gesha - ended up with two bags and would have gladly had none

Not sure where 2025 leads but B&W sub is down to a scale only. Going to keep SEY 2bag/mo, but the rest will be exploring other roasters. Might do a second bottomless scale and let it surprise me from their network of roasters.

For context I’m 23M currently living in the research triangle area of NC. I moved here last year after finishing grad school and am finding that it really just isn’t for me. Seems like a great place to raise a family, but as a single young professional who doesn’t drink, I don’t feel I fit very well here. I’m doing a research fellowship right now which ends in June, so I’m looking at other possibilities to move to this summer. Current list (no particular order) includes, Seattle, Portland (OR), SF (though col may be a deal breaker), DC, Chicago, Philadelphia, Phoenix (went to college in AZ), and Denver (where I grew up and where family is). 

I don’t think I have very strict guidelines, but I know plenty of people will let me know if I’m being too picky. Here are the criteria: 
1. Social scene that doesn’t revolve around drinking/alcohol. I don’t drink (just don’t like the taste) and don’t like being around people who are drinking/drunk. So somewhere where bar hopping isn’t the primary way to meet new people would be nice. I do like coffee and loved playing intramural sports in college (without drinking), so somewhere good for those would be nice. I also like museums, parks, and photography. I know these aren’t super conducive to meeting people though. 

2. Somewhere walkable (by my standards). When I say walkable I just mean there are neighborhoods where I could live that would allow to me to walk to parks, restaurants, coffee shops, etc. and access to transit would be nice as well. I have a car don’t mind driving for certain things, but having stuff within walking distance and proper pedestrian infrastructure would be nice. Where I am currently in NC, there are literally no side walks. I could not safely walk anywhere if I wanted to, not that there is even anything in walking distance. 

3. Good COL. Salary expectation is between 70-80k (kind of a low estimate to be safe, sf would be closer to 100k). Would like to be able to afford a 1 bedroom apartment

4. Good career options. I’m still figuring out what I want to and wouldn’t be surprised if I stayed at my next job couple years then left for something else. For context I’m in the Econ/stats/social science field. 

That’s pretty much it. The social aspect is most important to me. I know the whole “the social scene is what you make of it” thing, I agree but let’s be real there are places that are much tougher to meet people and places with more alcohol driven social scenes than others. I’m currently applying to jobs in all these cities and remote ones. Currently have trips planned to Chicago, and Portland and Seattle in the next couple months to scout out the areas. Any advice would be much appreciated! 

Edit: Didn’t mean to suggest I won’t move anywhere with a bar scene, just want somewhere that has ample, non-alcoholic alternative ways to socialize and meet people. I know I will probably be in the minority as an early 20 something who doesn’t drink. ",5,1736133328.0,SameGrassButGreener,33,1.0,False

Let's clear up the confusion about the word Kona as it applies to the Big Island. (Because it applies to every Hawaiian island -- it means ""west."" And every island has a west side.)

1. It means west. Most of the resorts on the west side of the island -- no matter how remote -- will call themselves ""Kona"" because it isn't false advertising. It would be more accurate for some resorts far north of the airport to call themselves ""Scrubland and goats central.  We developed golf courses and resorts because this area is so remote it was relatively cheap."" Instead, they call themselves ""Paradise Plumeria Kona Residences at the Village"" -- it's just marketing.
2. It USUALLY means the town Kailua-Kona. Abbreviated K-K. ""Kona"" is used locally about as often as ""Frisco"" is used by San Franciscans. Further muddying the waters, O'ahu has a Kailua as well. That can be a problem when trying to find things with Google Maps. Wonder why tourists drive down boat ramps into the Pacific Ocean? That's why.
3. It ALSO means the Kona Coffee Belt, which is 35 miles long and a little more than a mile wide. In order to be Kona coffee, 100% of the farm must be on the belt. When I personally think ""Kona,"" this is what I'm thinking of. The Kona belt. Home.
4. And it means the Hyundai ""Kona"" mini SUV. As in, ""Honey, I'm going to run up to Kona; buy some whole-bean Kona at Costco; gas up the Kona; and then return home to Kona.""

Hope this clears things up.

This isn’t a criticism, just an observation by a random woman on the internet so take it with a grain of salt. 

I bought Jawhari by Daniel Rene from Aroma Concepts assuming it would be a rich gourmand and I was pretty taken aback when all my nose could detect was slightly sweet bitter coffee. On me it smells sour but on my husband it smells a little spicier, albeit still bitter. I’m hoping that the coffee will mellow with time and I’ll be able to come back to it and get more of the vanilla base notes. 

Furthermore, my bottle arrived with a small chip out of the bottom corner and I have to be careful when handling it so that I don’t hurt myself or accidentally knock that corner into anything and break the (admittedly very solid) bottle. That’s got nothing to do with the fragrance, just poor handling somewhere in the process. I know they sold out and were rushing to restock so this might have been a simple QA miss.

I am lost.","Hey, this is gonna be a pretty long post. Tbh I doubt anyone will read all of this.  For long time I have been trying to figure out what is going on with me and if someone has any idea I would love to hear it. 

In 2020 I'm starting to get symtpoms that resemble low blood sugar. They would happen soon after I drink a coffee. I would become shaky, have a racing heart, feel hungry, my stomach would feel empty and I would be sweating and feeling dizzy. I would always carry something like a banana and it would calm it down instantly. I would often start rapidly throwing food in my stomach and I would soon feel relief. I always needed food that kinda has oil or fat or white bread. These symptoms started getting worse and more frequent until I had my first ""adrenaline surge / attack"". I was kinda hungry but I took a little coffee and BOOM - ears ringing, BP 180/100, pulse of 200 or who knows, body feels like burning, shaking, I was sure I was dead. When it was over I was trembling and freezing and my stomach was gurgling loud. It kept happening and I didn't connect it to coffee as I thought it's blood sugar. 

All kinds of lab tests and imaging done - all good. As I have no idea what's happening, I start panicking and worrying and psychiatrist gives me clonazepam. I get an upper endoscopy done and it shows active gastritis, esophagitis and hiatal hernia. They put me on therapy for all that. Holter monitor shows large increases in HR after heavy meals. It's attributed to stomach pressing on heart or vagus nerve idk. I could walk long distances as far as I can remember and I didn't have POTS back then.

I stayed on clonazepam for too long as no one informed me that you become dependant after like 2 weeks. It's 2022 and I have reduced clonazepam to 0.7mg. In summer I get sick with EBV, covid, H pylori and more. I heal all that and keep reducing clonazepam. 

At the beginning of 2023 I'm at very low dose maybe 0.3mg and my nervous system goes haywire. Temperature regulation, shaking, bloodflow, BP spikes, bedbound. They do a tilt table test and I get diagnosed with POTS and post-viral fatigue. Psychiatrist increases clonazepam to 1.5mg and gives escitalopram. I start taking bunch of other supplements too.
After few months I'm doing good. I can drink 3 coffees a day, I work, I travel. POTS is gone. 

It's  2024 and I start reducing clonazepam again and I had very long stress in relationship. I'm down to 0.5mg and Im getting worse and worse. I start getting bloated, adrenaline surges like the ones from 2020, POTS returns, subfebril (low grade fiverish for 2 months), severe fatigue. I go to the doctor again and tilt table test shows POTS again and he diagnoses me with CFS now. But now tests show positive borelia western blot so they give me antibiotics for 3 weeks and fever is gone. My stomach feels screwed again. 

Btw each time I had this crash (2020,2022,2024) before that I lost weight and changed my eating habits, even skipped a lot of meals (which is probably not smart when you have acid problems anyway) and kinda screwed my stomach.  

Now I have no idea what caused what, how did POTS dissapear, I've seen people get dysautonomia from benzo withdrawal, I have seen people get stomach problems from dysautonomia, people getting palps from hiatus hernia, and I HAVE NO DAMN CLUE WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME AND WHAT TO DO...

I messaged her two months ago to reconnect after hitting rock bottom. We met at a coffee shop and started reminiscing about the times when things were better. We started hanging out once a week at the coffee shop before moving to the bar to hang out. A couple weeks ago we both got really drunk and by the end of the night we started making out. One thing led to another and we ended up doing the deed. She's cute but the sex didn't feel that amazing. Maybe I'm just spoiled since all my exes were good in bed but she just didn't have the sexual experience I was hoping for. We continued to go on a few more dates but knowing that she was low mid at best under the sheets was a huge turn off for me so I started getting into dating apps. I met this cute girl on hinge and we started chatting it up till eventually decided to move from the talking stage and meet in person. The problem was I accidentally set up a date with her as the same one as Eevie because that's during a time that works best for me and I didn't even realize until it was too late to cancel to hang out. Since I already slept with Eevie I thought maybe we could just have an in and out quickie at her place and then I go meet up with this dating app girl. I text the dating app girl that we'll just call Sharla, that I was going to be a bit late. She was fine with that so I drove over to Eevie's house with some leftovers I had in my fridge from a few nights ago. She greeted me outside of her house dressed up and ready to go but I turned the car off as she was about to get inside. She asked me what was wrong and I said she was just too stunning to contain himself over the course of an entire date length and that I wanted to smash immediately. This seemed to turn her on because she smirked and said alright as I handed her the leftovers and we headed up to her room right after. The sex was some how even worse than last time but that was alright because Sharla was so attractive I needed to pregame before I could hit. Nothing materialized with the woman from hinge so I turned my full attention to Eevie and continued to make bad love to her while chatting her up and getting closer nd closer. Eventually, she invited me to accompany her and her friend (We'll call him Greg"") on a trip to Vegas. I say yes and everything seems to be going well, we shop along the strip, we play in the casino, we get some drinks. Then things turned when they invite me to their hotel room late at night after some drinking. Eevie guides me to the lone chair in the room and sits me down and to stay put and that I will ""get my turn"". My drunken self said ok and for two hours I watched them aggressively make love to each other. After that was all over, Eevie took one look at me at said she was too tired to go again that night and so we all went to bed. Nothing else happened the rest of the time in Vegas, and she acts as if nothing ever happened, always deferring the topic when I bring it up. The worse part is she's been getting better and better each time we do it and I just know its because of fucking Greg. I want this to stop but the sex has been getting actually pretty good so I don't know when I should confront her about this more because she is fulfilling my needs as a lonely male.

Note: Im going to talk to a therapist(telehealth). I have stuff planned out for this month. Mainly due to extreme anxiety, which i this likely all just is cause im aware its weird. Idk how to actualy open up about it cause it will sound weird.

Also my brain is being funky. For 36 hours I ""realized trully how stupid and illogical my fears were that there was weed hidden in the coffee and tea bags and that something non-physical was watching me through the clock on the wall.

Some weird stuff about telepathy, i worked through it, then... 36 hours (after quitting caffine and sugar almost completely)... it kinda began to creep back and my brain is back at it.

""flashing lights on that device? I think somethings using it to monitor the room and people around it.""

My mind feels like theres a clock someone resets frequently, and it just reset and idk how long its going to roll. ""What if someones using it as data to train something like those youtube videos where people train ai to do something"". Of course that could just be anxiety, right? I hope? Ive been dealing with alot of anxiety that ive mostly been working on puttng behind me.

totally normal and not weird.  i thought quitting coffee would fix it. (usually too much coffee causes paranoia and thoughts like others people are tracking me or certain situations are just weird special people just monitoring(cause why did i run into those specific people several times in the store. must mean something right?).  maybe I had too much sugar. I got to a point where I realized that hey i was majorly projecting my emotions outward and reading that as a variety of things. Now I'm slipping away from that.

It was really clear outside and others said there was going to be a blizzard and i took this to mean that it was a parralel to my good state of mind was going on a simmilar path and it would soon get worse. There was no coffee pods available where I was, so that means im doing the right thing by quitting coffee(possibly this re-run of the clock i need to test my brain without caffine). Ik how it sounds if i told anyone. My brain was chilling for a couple days(no anxiety) and i think i did something to break it back down again. (I dont do drugs or anything... so it wasnt that, just anxiety and looking at some old weird stuff I wrote).

technically it was 36 hours where I trully deep down realized internally that i was just being weird vs telling myself I was. Like 36 hours where no part of me really thought that way anymore. But i was floating towards it for a while so maybe I'm jut going to linger around there due to no caffine and low sugar.",1,1736132430.0,mentalillness,0,1.0,False

Not a gamer was sleeping, their patience upset.
The forums were buzzing with rumors and leaks,
Of power and features they’d dreamt of for weeks.

The GPUs were nestled, still shrouded in code,
With promises whispered of performance untold.
And I at my desktop, with coffee in hand,
Refreshed every rumor, from each leaker’s brand.

When out on the web there arose such a clatter,
I sprang to my monitor to see what was the matter.
To Reddit, to YouTube, I flew like a flash,
Hoping for specs that would drop in a splash.

The moon on the glow of my RGB gear
Gave a luster of hype to the season of cheer.

As much as I wish their was good all over the world, theirs still terrible people and uncomfortable situations that Allah tests us through.

I have questions regarding conflict but within different circumstances.

How would you handle small situations? For example, someone being rude to you, (you’re at a store and you really need help with someone but the worker has a very bad attitude and is annoyed by you asking for help.) you’re at an airport, and you’re having issues with a flight but the workers are making you have a hard time, someone is screaming at you for a mistake you made (maybe you walked through the wrong door at a office) 

What about a situation where it’s Islamophobia/racism? You’re walking either in hijab or wearing a thobe and someone says a comment to you or to someone their with loud enough so that you can hear? Would you laugh at them, make them know you heard them, would you confront them..? 

And then in the most severe cases, (for the ones who don’t live in majority Muslim countries) what about someone being outwardly angry and racist to you? For example, not sure if people have seen but theirs a video of some old lady at a Tim Hortons yelling at a Muslim couple and trying to pour coffee on the wife who is pregnant but the husband stepped in. No one else did, everyone just watched.

I’m just asking these because me personally I deal with the little scenarios in a sarcastic manner. BAnd Alhamdulilah I haven’t experienced like the scary Islamophobia scenarios, I pray a lot for it to never happen to me and my family because living in America and going to certain areas (predominantly white areas in the suburbs) can be scary.

I’ve just purchased a Hario Switch 03, a 1L carafe and a 1.2L gooseneck kettle. Looking to make large hot (& Japanese style iced) coffee’s for my wife & I. Was using a drip machine but found it to be barely passable, likely because it was damn near the cheapest on the market. Found that using it as a makeshift immersion pour over produced better results even with the same coffee. 

From my reading & research I’m guessing at a 1:13 ratio of coffee to water, slightly courser grind, slightly lower brew temp, 5x200g pours (not sure about the initial bloom & immersion I was going to start with 200g water @93° for 30 sec & adjust from there). Was going to use immersion for the first 200g of water then pour over for the next 4, adjusting if needed. I will be grinding fresh too so can micromanage grind size. 

Am I even in the ballpark of correct in terms of technique? Any advice from tech to temp to roast to whatever you think will help is much appreciated.",3,1736132029.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I looked around to ask any of my fam about their opinion about the show but was surprised they were gone. I was now alone. I just assumed they got bored and left.

I decided to quit watching but i can't find the remote anywhere nearby. So i got down on the floor and look under the coffee table. There were loud noises, screaming, explosions, alarms and sirens flaring, but i just assumed the show just reached its climax and kept looking for the remote. I was reaching under the couch when suddenly the power went out.

I started to panic when i realize the noises got louder even when my tv was now off. I quickly got up, peered through my blinds and saw my neighborhood engulfed in chaos. People running around, houses bursting into flames, helicopters roaming the sky. 

Then the ground shook violently causing me to lose balance and fall down but i didn't hit the ground and just kept falling, and falling. The sensation startled me and it woke me up. 

Still feeling a little groggy, i was now calming down after realizing it was just a dream. Everything is quiet now. The lights were off, but it wasn't dark cause the tv was still on but paused.

I sat down, grab the remote by the side table and turn the tv off. The room is now softly lit by the light coming from streetlamps outside. I got up and peered thru the window and saw a calm neighborhood. A few houses still had their holiday decorations on illuminating the streets.

But then i realized. It was a little bit too quiet. No barking or howling, no hum from the ac, no nightbirds no crickets nor any other random noises. Panic settling in and i can feel my heart racing and i was heaving but i cannot hear my own heartbeat nor my own breathing. Not even that annoying ringing sound i hear when it's too quiet. 

Then i got distracted from the glare from the corner of my peripheral vision, so i turned to look at the direction. Bright light piercing thru the corner of the room. Like some kind of spark from a welding tool it cuts thru and starts tearing what's in front of me, revealing what seems like outer space, with all the galaxies.

Soon enough I was in space and I was awed by the amazing view. I don't have a perception of my own body anymore but I can will myself to look around. Like I was playing some VR, i could turn around 360° but i cannot see my own body. 

The stars began to revolve slowly like I was passing them by but i don't actually feel moving at all. It felt more like they are moving pass me. So i turned around to see were they were going. The stars revolves and spinning around, condensing faster and faster, forming somewhat circular glow. Like the sea of stars was draining down a drain so dark i can't see nothing but pitch black darkness in the middle growing bigger.  

It went on for a few seconds until it engulfed everything until there was nothing left. I can no longer tell if my eyes were closed or not cause i can't see anything. I can't hear anything. I can't feel anything. I tried my best to scream.

I woke up screaming. Another one of my sleep paralysis episodes, but felt way scarier.

I was a driver (just quit) at a franchise that was extremely poorly managed. GM is wholly incompetent, barely does his job. He harasses customers and employees alike and tried to intimidate one of the managers into quitting for making him look bad. He is a pervert and makes obscene sexual remarks and has even peeped up the skirts of high school girls who came to our stores. Despite these things and the fact that he loses us the little business we have, he is enabled by the franchise owner. The FO is aware of his incompetence and behavior and refuses to reprimand or fire him because he “keeps the lights on.” 

That said, we arrive at today. There is a massive snowstorm sweeping the United States now. I came into work this morning and did my usual duties. I understood there was possible risk but I am confident in my driving abilities and trusted (perhaps naively) that if I ran into a concern I could trust my own employer to handle it. Well, on my second delivery (using a company car) I became stuck at the bottom of a road where I had to deliver. There was too much snow and I could not get traction. I immediately call my manager to let him know. The car was not damaged whatsoever. He then calls the owner who says he will call a tow truck. I went back and forth with them for hours about when this truck would show up while waiting for a rideshare car that could pick me up. 

I admit that I waited at first because I believed a tow truck might be on its way. However I lost hope and then tried to order a ride. My safety is more important than company property. I informed the GM that I would be leaving the car and was given instructions on how to leave it for the tow truck. 

While I continue to wait for my ride, I am notified that my location is no longer being used in the delivery app and I knew I had been clocked out. I called my GM and asked him why the hell he clocked me out when I’m still stranded out in the middle of a blizzard. He did not know and said it must have been the owner. I asked to speak with the owner who did not give me a straight answer for why he had clocked me out.

When I finally got a ride and returned to the store, I posed the question to the owner again. He lied to my face and told me that the GM had informed him I was going home. That is, in fact, NOT what I told the GM and I have texts to prove it. He then said something along the lines of “I appreciate you, you scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours”. He offered me five extra hours of compensation. 

I reluctantly agreed and asked if he could put that in writing. He did not put it in writing and acted as if the suggestion were offensive. He then proceeded to pull out a fat stack of bills from his wallet and flicked me two 20’s and told me to have a good night. No sincere apology or other assistance was even OFFERED for the hours I was stuck. 

Fortunately the customer had a kind heart and offered me coffee while I waited, even adding cash onto my already generous tip.

1huopaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/punchout/comments/1huopaq/nintendo_might_dodge_punches_but_gamerant_dodges/,"“Nintendo might dodge punches, but GameRant dodges humor.”","**Original link:** [https://gamerant.com/punch-out-new-game-unlikely-dead-why/](https://gamerant.com/punch-out-new-game-unlikely-dead-why/)

**My hot take:** *“I posted this glorious Punch-Out roast on GameRant, but apparently, Little Mac wasn’t the only one getting knocked out.”*

Anyway for humor's sake this is what (all) the characters of Punch-Out's 2009 wii would say in 2025 about their glorious (and I mean fabulous) stereotypes:

=====================================================

*Cue dimly lit basement, folding chairs in a circle, stale coffee in the corner. A neon sign flickers:* ***""PUNCH-OUT!! ANONYMOUS""*** 🥊☕

**Doc Louis:**

*""Alright, everyone, welcome back to Punch-Out!! Anonymous. We're all here because Nintendo ghosted us harder than Little Mac ghosting cardio day. Who wants to start?""*

**Little Mac:**

*""Hi, I'm Little Mac, and I'm a Nintendo mascot…technically. I've trained harder than anyone here, and my reward? Smash Bros. benchwarmer. Thanks, Sakurai.""*

**Doc Louis:**

*""Mac, baby, you ain't even DLC-worthy anymore. Now pass the mic before I eat it.""* 🍫🎤🥊

**Glass Joe:**

*""Bonjour, I'm Glass Joe, and I have the win-loss record of a weathered baguette. But at least I didn't lose to a wooden chair, Aran.""* 🥖😂

**Aran Ryan:**

*""Oh, real rich coming from a guy who folds faster than Nintendo's PR team during controversy.""*

**Glass Joe:**

*""At least my greatest rival isn't a restraining order from the furniture department, you unhinged potato.""*

**Von Kaiser:**

*""Guten Tag, I'm Von Kaiser. Nintendo says I'm too aggressive. ME? Aggressive? I just yell motivational phrases like 'DO BETTER, OR I WILL CRUSH YOU INTO STRUDEL.'""*

**Disco Kid:**

*""Heyyyy sugar pies, Disco Kid here! I'm all glitter and groove, baby. Nintendo says I'm 'too flamboyant.' Yeah? And Mario isn't flamboyant in his fifth different golf outfit? Please.""*

**King Hippo:**

*""Greetings, peasants. I'm King Hippo, and I've been told my belly is 'problematic.' Bro, it's not my fault Nintendo keeps eating up Luigi's Mansion sequels instead of feeding me screen time.""* 🍔👑🎮

**Piston Honda:**

*私は本物の戦士です。私の眉毛は侍の刀のように鋭いです。しかし、任天堂は私たちの方向に眉をひそめることさえできません。*

*Watashi wa honmono no senshi desu. Watashi no mayuge wa samurai no katana no yō ni surudoi desu. Shikashi, Nintendō wa watashitachi no hōkō ni mayu o hisomeru koto sae dekimasen.*

*( ""I am a true warrior. My eyebrows are sharp like a samurai's blade. But Nintendo can't even raise a single one in our direction."" )*

**Bear Hugger:**  
*""Hey there, I'm Bear Hugger. Nintendo says I'm too 'stereotypically Canadian.' Oh, sorry for respecting nature, eh? Meanwhile, Wario's out here actively committing tax fraud in every single game.""* 🍁🐻💸

**Great Tiger:**  
*""Namaste, everyone. I’m Great Tiger. Nintendo says I’m too ‘mystical.’ Bro, Link literally time-travels with an ocarina and rides a talking boat. But I’m the problem?""* 🐅⏳

**Don Flamenco:**  
*""Ah, mi amor! Nintendo says I’m ‘too passionate.’ Are you serious? Bowser kidnaps a princess every Tuesday and calls it ambition. Meanwhile, I’m out here looking like a telenovela heartthrob and I’m the issue?""* 🌹💃🎭

**Aran Ryan:**  
*""Ahhh, top o’ the mornin’, everyone! Nintendo says I’m ‘too aggressive and chaotic.’ Bruh, have you seen Kirby? That pink menace literally consumes universes and smiles about it. But sure, I’m the scary one.""* 🍀🥊🎭

**Glass Joe** (cutting in)**:**

*""Your greatest achievement is being the final boss of a folding chair,* ***mon ami.****""*

**Aran Ryan:**

*""Your greatest achievement is being the tutorial enemy,* ***ya baguette fossil.****""*

**Soda Popinski:**

*""Здравствуйте! (Good day, my comrades!) They watered me down to soda pop, comrades. But Mario? He’s out here drinking mysterious potions and growing ten feet tall. How's that not suspicious?""*

**Bald Bull:**

*RAAAH! Nintendo says I’m too intimidating. Meanwhile, Ganondorf’s out here chucking lightning bolts at toddlers. I headbutted one guy and suddenly, I’m the villain.*

**Super Macho Man:**

*Oh honey, Nintendo told me I was ‘too much.’ Meanwhile, Captain Falcon is out here karate-chopping planets in half while wearing skintight spandex. But I’m the over-the-top one?* 💪

**Mr. Sandman:**

*""Listen up. I’m Mr. Sandman, and I put people to sleep professionally. Nintendo says I’m ‘too intimidating.’ Bro, have you seen Tom Nook’s mortgage payments? Now that’s scary.""* 🛌

**Donkey Kong:**

*""OOH OOH AH AH!"" (Throws banana peel at a coffee cup)*

*(Translation: ""Y’all still mad about stereotypes? I’ve been wearing the same red tie since the Reagan administration. Call me when that gets an update."")* 🍌

**Doc Louis (Mic Drop Time):**

*""Well, Nintendo might’ve left us in the basement, but guess what, baby? We’re still swingin’, still laughing, and still ready to clock in the second they blow the dust off our gloves. Now go get ‘em, champ!""* 🥊🍫

=========================================================

***Cue applause, folding chairs creak, and someone awkwardly tries to refill the stale coffee pot.***

=========================================================

**Final Note from The Gremlin Commentary Booth (me):**  
**====================================**

*This group therapy session was brought to you by Nintendo’s fear of commitment and a whole lotta unresolved potential. 🛎️🔥*

=========================================================

*Trolling aside. Here's my final take on that and the future for Punch-Out to come:*

=========================================================***🧠***   


***-- The Problem -- Punch-Out's KO Moment:***

*First off, the Punch-Out series is caught in an* ***impossible paradox*** *:*

*-* ***Keep the charm and legacy:*** *Fans want the goofy, over-the-top stereotypes* ***because that's what Punch-Out is****.*

*-* ***Avoid backlash:*** *Modern audiences and critics (rightfully) call out stereotypes for being problematic.*

***-- You can't have both without either --***

*1. Watering down the characters into bland archetypes, losing their unique appeal.*

*2. Doubling down on the stereotypes, and risking becoming the internet's punching bag (pun intended).*

*On top of that, Nintendo isn't a charity. If Luigi's Mansion and Mario Strikers are raking in* ***Scrooge McDuck levels of coin*** *, why would they bother investing in something* ***that'll cause PR headaches and barely sell by comparison?***

﻿*Nintendo's motto might as well be:* ***“If it doesn't print money, it's not our problem.”***

***----💡 How To Solve It (Punch-Out Style) ----***

*#### 1.* ***Lean Into the Goofiness, Not the Stereotypes:***

*- Keep the cartoonish charm but* ***modernize*** *the humor.*

*- Characters don't have to rely on outdated stereotypes to be fun. Think less* ***“over-the-top national caricatures”*** *and more* ***“absurd personalities.”***

*Example:*

﻿***Soda Popinski →*** *Make him an unhinged fitness influencer chugging protein shakes and Energy drinks mid-fight.*

***King Hippo →*** *A social media food critic who fights between bites of burgers.*

*#### 2.* ***Make It a Cross-Over Chaos Fighter:***

*- Integrate characters from other Nintendo properties or even indie games. Imagine facing off against Wario, Captain Falcon, or even Shovel Knight in a Punch-Out-style boxing ring.*

*- Every fight could be wildly different, with gimmicks tailored to each character.*

*#### 3.* ***Double Down on Little Mac's Storyline:***

*- Make Little Mac's journey \*cinematic\*.*

*- A gritty underdog story but with Nintendo's charm. Maybe he's retired, washed up, and trying to make a comeback in a hilariously self-aware way.* ***Think \*Rocky Balboa\* meets \*Scott Pilgrim vs. The World\*.***

*#### 4.* ***Digital-Only / Indie-Sized Release:***

*- If* ***big-budget development*** *is too risky, make it* ***a smaller eShop-exclusive project***.

*- Lower expectations, lower risk, and if it \*pops off\* (pun intended), they can escalate from there.*

*#### 5.* ***Give It to Another Studio:***

*- If* ***Next Level Games*** *is too busy polishing Luigi's flashlight or Wario's cleats, give Punch-Out to an indie studio with a passion for the series.*

*- Studios like* ***Yacht Club Games (Shovel Knight)*** *or the* ***Thunder Ray devs*** *could absolutely knock it out of the park.*

﻿==== 🔥 ***The Hot Take Conclusion (The ""EXTREME"" deep cut edition)*** 🔥 ====

*Nintendo’s hesitation to revisit Punch-Out isn’t about the stereotypes—it’s about their fear of commitment.*

They’re treating ***Punch-Out*** like a risky stock investment while they’re busy counting *Luigi’s Mansion* gold coins and *Mario Kart 8 Deluxe* microtransactions. But here’s the thing:

* **Stereotypes aren’t the issue—it’s execution.** Characters don’t have to rely on outdated tropes; they can evolve into modern, absurd personalities without losing their charm.

**And GameRant?** Oh, bless your hearts. You’ve turned the *Punch-Out* discussion into the equivalent of **Glass Joe tripping over his shoelaces.** **You can’t declare a franchise “dead” while ignoring every possible way it could thrive with a little creative vision.**

* *Did you ask what fans want?*
* *Did you explore indie potential?*
* *Did you even try to see beyond the surface level?*

**Nope.** Just hit **publish** and walked away like ***King Hippo at an all-you-can-eat buffet.*** 🍗

But hey, here’s the truth: ***Punch-Out can absolutely work today.*** Give it to an indie dev with passion, lean into the humor, and keep the charm intact. The fans are here. The love is here. The potential is ***dripping off the ropes.***

So GameRant, next time you want to call a beloved franchise *“effectively dead,”* maybe try stepping into the ring and *actually fighting for it.*

***Your move, Nintendo. "" Ding-ding!""*** *🥊✨*  
*From your loving Punch-Out fanbase.*

***P.S. Please give me your thoughts. Humorist takes especially when the cast dig some 4th wall breaking comments, etc. Love you guys. Stay safe and keep up the fight.***",3,1736131181.0,punchout,0,1.0,False

In Carrie's own words: ""Yes, I have made some mistakes, and Charlotte? *You* have made some mistakes. And when you were making those mistakes, I was sitting across from you at the coffee shop nodding, and listening, and supporting you. I was *not* sitting at a Chinese restaurant *turning away,* when you should have been *looking at me.""*

From this, I gathered that what actually hurt Carrie was the way Charlotte turned away, loudly sipping her drink, as she talked about her financial issues. I think that, by doing this, Charlotte accidentally made Carrie feel judged, and that caused this explosion of emotion from her. 

So it's always interesting to me when people only ever discuss the offering money part of this argument, since I think this was the lesser issue in Carrie's own mind.",53,1736131141.0,sexandthecity,32,0.93,False

If I remind him or ask him he tries...but I often have to give him the words to say. He also has a tough time telling me he is in the mood. He often gets annoyed when I ogle him and suggest fun n games.

He gets uncomfortable when I compliment him but at least he says ""thanks babe"" instead of awkward silence or changing the subject like he used to do. We have been together for 6 years. He has a chronic illness that zaps his energy. We have read Love Languages and he knows I thrive on words. He has explained how he just struggles to get words out. He also says he was brought up in a home that never shared feelings or compliments verbally for fear of being ridiculed.

I have tried romantic or flirty texts and emails to see if that would get him to express more. I get a heart emoji in response.

The timing of the disconnect makes me think it fell off in the Whistler Marketplace parking lot over by McDonalds, but I can’t confirm this. So there is a possibility it was still on my wrist until some later point between Lot 4 and the top of 7th.

So I've been doing a sort of pseudo-fast thing for ages in that I typically have just coffee for breakfast, but I have my coffee with milk and tend to eat dinner pretty late, so I doubt this was at all effective. Anyway, I'm currently doing a weight loss clean living thing in solidarity with a friend, so I've decided to commit to intermittent fasting (16:8).

The issue I'm having is that I never seem to get hungry during the day; only when I'm lying in bed having already started my fast. It doesn't help that I typically go to bed past midnight, so it works out that the only time of day when I'm hungry is at 2am when I haven't eaten for 6 hours. The past couple of days this has kept me up, so I've gone downstairs and had some food, but honestly eating at night just makes you feel like shit. On the flip side, I'm fine with going the entire day without food - my schedule is just completely nocturnal.

Long tangent, my bad, but the question is, do your hunger cues adjust to your fasting schedule? And if so, how long does it take? I also don't want to be starving to death in morning lectures lol",6,1736131026.0,intermittentfasting,7,0.88,False

I been love of dunkin coffee for long time (3-4 yrs) but recently for past 2months i notice the coffee is NOT the same flavour/aroma.  it's more dark n less aorma..   
I am HSP (highly sensative personality) so i detected slightest of changes in taste/smell/details. 

I like to have hot coffee 90%, with heavy cream milk 10% 3 splenda 2 stevia. I been consistent n loved dunkin coffee with perfect light flavour n aroma. 

I hate to break it to you guys but this coffee Quality is not the same. Perhaps due to rising cost of coffee in South America.. may be the supplier may have been switched, to save cost.   
I am going to quit, its not the same, the way how darker n less aroma thtere is, might as well make my own instant coffee at home. (add a bit of zero sugar french vanilla - int'l delight milk)

Eitherway, we are not getting the same flavour coffee, this is my opinion.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Outdoor living spaces are becoming more valuable for homeowners. One of the best ways to enhance your deck or patio is by adding a deck propane fire pit. Not only does it provide warmth and ambiance, but it also serves as a focal point for gatherings. Let’s explore the benefits of deck propane fire pits and why they are a worthwhile investment for your outdoor spaces.

### Convenience and Ease of Use

One of the biggest advantages of using a deck propane fire pit is its convenience. Unlike traditional wood-burning fire pits, propane models ignite with the simple push of a button. This means no more struggling with kindling or waiting for logs to catch fire. You can enjoy a cozy fire in mere moments!

### Controlled Flames

With a propane fire pit, you have complete control over the flame height and heat output. This allows you to adjust the fire to suit your needs, whether you want a low flame for a romantic evening or a more robust blaze for roasting marshmallows. You won’t have to worry about sudden gusts of wind blowing the fire out or spreading embers.

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/deck-propane-fire-pit  
  
### Less Maintenance Required

Wood-burning fire pits require frequent cleaning and maintenance. The ashes can create a mess and need to be disposed of regularly. In contrast, propane fire pits produce minimal waste, meaning less time spent cleaning up and more time enjoying your outdoor space. Simply connect your fire pit to your propane tank and you’re good to go.

### Eco-Friendly Option

For those who are environmentally conscious, a deck propane fire pit can be an eco-friendly choice. Propane burns cleaner than wood, emitting fewer pollutants into the air. This is especially important if you live in an area with air quality regulations. You can feel good about enjoying your fire while reducing your impact on the environment.

I see vegans occasionally post about seemingly having intensely visceral emotional states when seeing people eat meat and consume/use similarly made products- this all of course makes sense. I understand if you view eating animals as murder, consuming dairy as exploitation, etc, its going to be upsetting watching people support financially such products.


It seems it can be extremely overwhelming and almost mind consuming at times to the point that people who have these intense feelings can hardly think about anything else at times....


 my question is for people who experience this deep emotional state, does it only apply to animal products, or does it apply broadly to any such suggestion of travesty trigger it as well? 
 Does people consuming specific brands of chocolate that use child slavery for example cause the same reaction? Specific brands of coffee? It's still people contributing to immense suffering and travesty and even death, is it more intense when it's not related to human suffering or do these vegans experience the same emotional distress?

1huoj68,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1huoj68/i_want_to_stop_receiving_gifts_from_everyone_in/,"I want to stop receiving gifts from everyone in my family except my wife, but idk what to say.","I have a big family and I want to stop giving gifts to so many people. I'm in my mid 30s and my relatives are in their late 50s to mid 60s. We all come from the same house (in my early childhood I was raised by my grandparents) who filled two living rooms with presents for our entire extended family. It was a HUGE event. I feel bad not being successful enough where I can get everyone something small but everyone has moved to different states so its a hassle and frankly I make the least out of everyone, so it's hard. And if I get a gift I want it to mean something? Not be an obligation. For my aunts and uncles who have children I don't even bother considering their kids because we're not close. I'll only buy them something if we attend an event (like a graduation).

One issue is my wife expects us to give an equal or greater gift to the giver, and I just can't do that. This makes me feel cheap, like the grinch. We also aren't having kids so if anyone gets us gifts it goes to us instead of a child which I feel weird about. We're adults and don't need it. Like, getting or giving a random gift is always  nice but the obligation  should only be for little ones and your spouse (IMO). However, my aunts will still get something anywhere from $50-120 and I feel the need to give back, so even though I love them and enjoy spending time with them it's just obligatory at this point and I want to stop.

My parents (aunt and uncle who are like my parents) overspend on me and my wife, and we arent having children. Since I was in my late 20s I've tried to pick up the bill whenever we go out to eat and get bigger gifts for their bdays depending on how financially well off I've done in the year, but in the end its never as much ... as a young man and now as an adult they have always gotten me more. Honestly, I'd be much happier if we just took turns paying for dinner instead of the whole hullabaloo. For perspective I'd say they spend $250 on us while we spend $100 on them. For birthdays they spend maybe $300 on us while we spend $150 - $200 on them.

This year I said fuck it and bought everyone coffee, except my parents. I got them a few small things they asked for. My relatives got us food, while my parents spent big money on my wife and I. My wife chewed me out for not getting them enough, but even when I asked what they wanted they told me very inexpensive stuff.

This is what I would like to do. Really only buy something special for my wife and ask my parents if we can change the gift giving into a new tradition of going out to eat. I have one aunt who is like a sibling kind of a mother but lives the furthest. Instead of gifts, I'd just like to put the money towards travel so I can see her every few years (pay for dinners). Two other aunts, same thing, no more presents put the money towards traveling funds and buy dinner when we see them. Is anything I'm saying abnormal? I wonder how and who the rest of you buy gifts for.

They are the go to by many people. I personally do not like just going for the consumables like a coffee or drink and want to go for something reusable. The ones in stores are deceptive because they do not have that much merchandise compared to corporate locations. The last year I had my eyes on the reusable straws they sell but are a bit pricey at 13 dollars a straw. This year I was given a 15 dollar Starbucks card and a 20 dollar Starbucks card. I saw for the holiday season they had red ones. I called around because they had changed the color to purple after the holiday season. I eventually found one near by that had the red ones and asked them to put it on hold. Turned out the red ones were 50% off and they had other items that were also 50% off that they had sold for the holidays. So I got 50% off for getting the color I wanted for the reusable straws and pipe cleaner and then they had cups that were color changing that had reusable straws as mine only had 2 and the cleaner so I was able to get 2 items for 50% off and use my Starbucks gift cards I got over the holidays for it. I found it funny that they were 50% off because the only difference was the color of one and the fact one mentioned the holidays on the packaging. Nothing I would spend my own money on but really useful if you have gift cards to there. Like I mentioned many service workers do have these cards laying around.

I've needed my wisdom teeth removed for a long time. I'm 25 and I think they came in when I was younger. Spotty access to dental care. Anyway, I had a cleaning/checkup and a couple fillings done early last year while I had dental. I was told my wisdom teeth really need to be removed and have cavities. Specifically one is in a pretty advanced state of decay. That's why they hurt - I told the dentist that they were ""coming in"" and I'd had ""teething"" pain on and off for years. It makes more sense now that I know more. I can feel the bad one with my tongue and yeah, it's, like, barely there anymore. Of course the dentist told me I needed them removed, but it would have cost me around $1200 with the dental coverage I no longer have, so I said I'd have to wait and just addressed what I could afford.

So I have dental again! Very similar benefits to last time, so cost would still be around $1200. I still don't have $1200 lying around. (Things are looking better financially though, and I'm in a much better position to save.) My question is: how soon do I need to deal with this? Is this something where I could wait another year? Or is it going to get infected/hurt me? Not willing to post pictures online, sorry. (Also I don't have one of those mirrors and don't want to shove my phone in my mouth.) I'm not in terrible pain, I get mild pain maybe once or twice a month.

I have very little credit history and it seems like a lot of credit/financing options are either 1) not available for such a low amount or 2) really expensive in the long run.

I vape but don't smoke. I don't drink at all. I eat an average amount of sugar for an American. I drink coffee in the morning and then water for the rest of the day. I brush my teeth twice a day and floss once a day. 

Thanks for reading. I'm deathly afraid of all this stuff. Like, thinking about it too much makes me break down in tears.

So, I wanted to give my overall thoughts and will try to give a somewhat detailed review. There was no lab testing, but I did try to do a couple of ‘lab like’ tests. This was done in a 4-bedroom 1 story house with no pets or dogs. I also got the version with the clean water and dirty water tubs (the standard) because the version that connects to the water pipes wouldn't suit my house layout at all. I’ve never owned a Dreame before and my last Roborock was many years ago.

 

Some new features:

 

\-Double brush design

\-Dustbin compression for Pets (If there is pet hair in the house, it will try to limit how much space is used in the dustbin via compression).

\-Retracting Lidar to access low areas

\-Electrolyzed water (Pro/Ultra versions only) - This is a good feature if you live in a country with 'hard' water as this can affect longevity of these devices.

\- Self-cleaning Filter

\- Self-cleaning tray

\- Ability to lift at high heights (I didn’t test this as I have no value in it and majority of you probably don’t either).

 

 

***Vacuum design: 8.5/10***

The vacuum looks very slick and modern. The retracting lidar with the different coloured LED is also a very nice touch, so I will give them props for this design. I will talk about functionality later on.

https://preview.redd.it/2b1bjaij1abe1.jpg?width=2905&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a6fef8b9bedab0a0e5beb6034e89262af94ad0b

***Dock Design: 8.5/10***

It feels very premium and looks like the X40 dock design. One of the main differences is the full removal tray is no more! And you only have a small filter tray that is removal. I’m sure some will be disappointed by this change but one of the features of the X50 is that it cleans its own tray and so far, I’ve found that to be true, after multiple cleans, the tray still looks spotless. However, it has now been a very similar design for a few editions of the top model for the dock, so I feel it is time for Dreame to take a bit of a risk and change it up for the x60 in the future. That is why I'm giving it an 8.5/10 because the dock looks good, but it’s the same design. In terms of functionality, I’d give it a 10/10. It did a good job cleaning the mops for example, so I tested it with some coffee powder and here are the

Overall, pretty good job.

 

***Brush design/anti-tangle: 10/10***

I live in a family full of females with very long hair, after multiple passes of the house, I’ve seen 0 hair getting caught in the brushes, so 10/10 for that one.

 

***Self-cleaning filter: 6/10***

 

This is one of the features that was mentioned for the X50, and it sounds great in theory. I tested it after cleaning up instant coffee powder, it did remove most of it: 

**before:** 

https://preview.redd.it/72or0croz9be1.jpg?width=3008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6f82d6b34d5a6b665c8ad76aa9cb17a41ad7d58

I wouldn’t say the filter has been thoroughly cleaned though and will likely require manual cleaning very soon. I also tried it on yellow sand and once again, it did clean the filter somewhat: I'd say the results are worse here.

**before:**

https://preview.redd.it/j4e7tn4yz9be1.jpg?width=3008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84e0bae076c50905d704b122088a1a7296ee46c3

but it wasn’t anything too significant. So, that’s why I gave it a 6/10 as it is a neat idea and has potential, but right now it is okay and slightly delays manual cleaning of the filter.

 

***Self-cleaning tray: 10/10***

 

https://preview.redd.it/izcundz50abe1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5ef0e1209a1f901b9de85a7b1b9eef8205315c0

The new design is very good, I did not have to clean it at all during its use and I likely will never have to clean it again. So, good job to Dreame on this one as it is definitely an amazing feature. There is a small filter tray in the middle that picks up debris and it just has to be emptied every so often.

 

 

***Retracting lidar: 6.5/10***

 

Design wise, it is a slick design, and the different LED colours are a neat touch. You have different settings for how cautious you want it to be in this feature.

https://preview.redd.it/o68jellv8abe1.jpg?width=1115&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f56c0065e2a5e01cec04d7c565913513891ba380

I tested it on a couch that has a high enough area underneath that it should be able to clean under it. The results were it using the retracting lidar in the beginning of the couch

https://preview.redd.it/i1ih74z73abe1.jpg?width=3008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=838598a422fb1210d9b8f8a7e95d1fca665f5411

However completely refusing to go any further despite there clearly being enough room + setting it on the least cautious option. That’s why I’m giving it a 6.5/10, right now it is way too overly cautious and I hope Dreame can improve this via firmware updates.

 

***Battery life: 5/10***

 

This is the most major disappointing aspect of the vacuum. Essentially 1% = 1 minute of use (on Clean Genius). You have around 90-100 minutes of use with a full battery, which is significantly less than the industry standard. I wouldn't say the vacuum is any faster than other brands in cleaning the house, so I can't justify it by saying it is quicker at navigating through the house, in fact it is sometimes slower in certain environments (Which I will talk about later). This is probably the biggest glaring issue with the vacuum and should be noted. However, if you plan to go to work at 8-9, let it start vacuuming and come back at 5-6 then you should be okay. For example, I started it at 8:45am and it finished at 4:45pm. The whole house area cleaned was around 121m\^2 and this was on Clean Genius (no deep cleaning).

 

***Carpet performance: 8/10***

 

So, in terms of carpet performance, it does pick up most things on the ground but, it does miss a few things including the sides of the room (Just unfortune limitation of most Robot Vacuums due to shape). I’m seeing multiple small pieces that it should pick up on the carpet + tiles and the sides are just full of small pieces. I feel this is because the FlexiArm is not used well in these situations when it comes to sides of rooms with carpet. I even set it (The FlexiArm) to the highest frequency via the app but I still had the small issue. Another thing I ran into was if there was 'stubborn' dust that is really stuck onto the carpet, it fails to really clean the majority of it. I thought the 20k kPa suction power would be enough, but no it isn't anywhere near enough. Also, it does this thing where let's say it vacuums just the carpet for 30 minutes, it will go back to ""wash the mops"" even though the mops were not used at all. I also notice the mops are dragging along the carpet to the point it somewhat distorts the shape of the mops, but luckily the carpet does not become even a little 'wet' at all due to this. One example of this is that I did one test where it was on carpet with Coffee Powder (Had issues, so will not bother talking about these results) and the mops were all stained after the test despite it not being used at all since it is on carpet:

This was just 1 run, so overall I’d say it did a very good job and probably would have gotten the last little bit after a second run.

  
Here is a map of the cleanup:

https://preview.redd.it/eafzt6k26abe1.jpg?width=490&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccb7bbbcf5d1cf4fc6b1f638a12d33c36f45c06c

 

***Mopping performance: 7/10***

 

The mopping is solid, the tiles come off as clean after a run and the extended mop makes sure every spot is covered. It does miss some small pieces of dust, but the FlexiArm is a lot more active on this surface and it does usually pick them up. The only negative is that the amount of water is uses can be high, but this can be changed via the settings. It does use the auto detergent, but considering it is 1:200 dilution, you will not notice the difference vs normal water. I tried testing the mopping  via the use of Coffee Powder on the ground to see how it deals with a situation like that.

It genuinely did a good job at the start, it recognised the stained areas and so it paid more attention to them:

I was happy with its performance until around 30% left, when it decided to start mopping with Coffee Powder present and so you got this:

The Coffee Powder was just attached to the ground at this point, so couldn’t continue the test anymore and probably would have been better using something else. However, large amounts of pieces were still on the ground but it is my fault for using Coffee Powder to do this test, it wasn't a good choice. It does fine in every day situations.

 

***Obstacle avoidance: 9/10***

 

The obstacle avoidance is very good, it avoids everything and recognises everything ALMOST right. This includes cables, small objects like a white toy pen that I couldn't even see on the carpet until it told me about it. The screenshot qualities are not great, but good enough that you will know what is in the way. However, the reason it isn't 10/10 is because it does have false positives at times especially on carpets with patterns on them, but sometimes it does correct itself and recognise there is no obstacle there later on. Also, it will recognise obstacles in the wrong part of the room sometimes, so it will ‘avoid’ it in the middle of the room when the actual obstacle is at the end of the room.

 

***Navigation: 7/10***

 

Overall, navigation is alright. If you have an open area with little obstacles. However, if you have things like a table with chairs that does not have a lot of room, few tall sofas closely together (where the robot vacuum can go under and clean), it struggles quite a bit to be honest and takes significantly longer than it should. It will also sometimes form random circles on the carpet, but this has gotten less after recent firmware updates. It also got stuck in one specific area, where there is a higher and lower carpet close to each other next to a wall even though it  should easily be able to get out of the situation, it just gives up and says there is an issue with the wheels (when there isn't). However, it was limited to that area only and I didn't experience this anywhere else. I would also say very tight spaces, it is not fantastic with, but I'm talking spaces barely bigger than itself so this is understandable. I forgot to mention, within 1 hour I see a massive white line across the vacuum, so it bumps into things (gently) and will do 360s when it is close to things such as well. I bought some thin PE foam tape and put it around the vacuum (avoiding sensors, cameras etc) and this resolved this issue but that 1 white line still remains.

 

***FlexiArm: 6.5/10***

I completely forgot about this one, but I did mention it in the other sections, I'd say it does overall alright job on non-carpet area but could be better used on carpet to cover the sides and should be turned on more frequently. 

***Maintenance: 9/10***

 

Pretty straightforward maintenance overall. Empty dirty water, re-fill the clean water, re-fill the auto detergent etc. The self-cleaning filter is 50/50 but the self-cleaning tray is amazing and does a really good job. Where it loses points for me is that I feel the cover where the auto detergent and dust bin are placed can be a lot more user friendly and easier to put back in. It required me doing it a few times before it finally sat properly. The app tells you when and what to replace over time as well, which is very nice.

 

***App experience: 7.5/10***

 

I'll keep this section short; it is a pretty good app and gets too much hate at times (outside certain firmware updates). It has a ton of features and is overall user friendly. I did run into one issue where when 90% of my house was vacuumed + mopped and this resulted in the app becoming very laggy, which is definitely an issue.

 

***Things I cannot/did not test:***

 

Longevity - Only had it for a short period.

Pet use - There are specific features it has to help with pets, but I don't have pets so any testing related to pets I can't discuss at all.

I can't test the voice commands (including via Alexa and Google) + AI voice features because it is the Chinese version.

Lift feature – No interest at all in this.

 Electrolyzed water - I wouldn't even know where to begin in terms of testing it.

 

Overall, I'd be lying to you if I said I was blown away by its performance, it has issues that need addressing that were mentioned above + the price it will be released at is likely going to make it likely the most expensive Robot Vacuum on the market once it is released, so I can't justify the price tag at that price (Probably $1900-2000 USD before discounts). However, I bought it for $650-700 USD (excluding additional costs to get it working here) so for that price, it was probably worth it. If you have the X40, I'd recommend saving your money and passing on this one unless you have pets then I'd look into the new features or If you feel the self-cleaning options etc are worth it. If you want a rating out of 10, I'd say it is a 7.5/10.

 

 

\*\*tl;dr\*\*

 

Overall, decent vacuum but has poor battery life (1 minute use = 1%), navigation can be iffy if complicated layout but otherwise does well, carpet performance + mopping is good but nothing mind blowing. New features like retracting lidar is too overly cautious, self-cleaning filter is okay, but the self-cleaning tray is extremely good.

If you have X40, skip this one unless you want the pet features and/or retracting lidar. The self-cleaning stuff maybe a selling point for some as well. 7.5/10",7,1736130510.0,RobotVacuums,8,1.0,False

Your lovely community has given me a lot of great starting points for planning a Hawaii trip with my spouse for next month, but I'm hoping to get some knowledgeable feedback on our current plan. 



Setting the scene: 

My spouse has a work conference in Honolulu next month. We are taking the opportunity to turn it into a vacation as well, with a few days together on Big Island before the conference, and then I'll mostly be entertaining myself solo on Oahu while they are busy networking and whatnot. We are from the Midwest, and are primarily interested in ocean time/snorkeling and other ecotourist type activities. Some of the museums and cultural things in Honolulu also caught my interest. We also love all food, especially seafood. I already have so many restaurant recs I've stolen from comments, but more are always welcome!  

I have learned from ya'll that winter is not necessarily the best time for ocean activities, but we will cross our fingers we can get a few snorkels in, guided or otherwise. We are intermediate level snorkelers (and scuba certified, though not planning on diving this trip) who have our own masks/snorkels/fins. 



Our current plan:

Feb 5: 

Fly to Kona. Current plan (not yet booked) is hotel + car rental booked through Costco. 

Feb 6-9: 

Volcano Nat'l Park 

Any/all of the following locations for snorkeling if able: 2 Step, Manini'owali Beach, Captain Cook, Kealakekua Bay. 

Night manta ray snorkel (through Sea Paradise?)

Other non-ocean activities if needed: Coffee or vanilla farms

Feb 10-16: 

Fly to Honolulu

As I will be mostly sightseeing solo for this portion of the trip, I'm not sure if it would be worth renting a car or not. Maybe just trying for a ride share or something on a few of the days? I also am not sure I would feel safe snorkeling without a buddy, but am open to guided excursions. 

Activities that have looked interesting, in no particular order: Foster Botanical Garden, Chinatown, Iolani Palace, Bishop Museum, Hololulu Zoo, Waikiki Aquarium, Hanauma Bay (could be difficult to get in, sounds like), Puu Ualakaa State Park, Makapu'u Point, Ali'i Beach Park.

This afternoon I went to read at one of my favorite places in my hometown. I love this place. It was one of the first places I went in fem clothes when I was working on my gender and have always considered it a safe place. As I was sitting trying to concentrate, a group of dudes sitting directly behind me kept distracting me with LITERAL N@ZI talking points. Like “the homeless should be rounded up and killed”, “white culture is being suppressed”, “we should fix the scouts so it has good propaganda and isn’t gay (????)”. I bit my tongue until the guy doing most of the talking says a literal antisemetic slur, and then I called him a fuckhead and told him to get out of the fucking coffee shop. I of course have no authority to do so, but thank god I’m pals with the owner who did tell them all to get lost. I didn’t give them the satisfaction of reacting to their halfassed “bye, sir”, but I was so fucking angry and sad and scared that I had to ask to be walked to my car. I can’t stop thinking about the terrible things I wish I could have done to these pieces of shit, and the terrible things they could do to me if we ever run into each other in a less safe place.

1huoaee,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1huoaee,Putting together my camp coffee kit and would love some suggestions,"My partner got me the coveted Stanley lunch box for my recent birthday as I’d been eyeing it for some time to make my own portable camp coffee kit for my outdoor adventures. 

I sat down this evening to see how everything fits and I had a few initial concerns on which y’all could maybe weigh in to help me dial this situation. 

Here’s what’s in the box already:
- Firemaple 600ml Gooseneck Kettle
- Firemaple Ultralight Titanium stove
- Isobutane canister
- 1zpresso Q
- MHW 3Bomber scale
- Plastic Hario v60-02 with filters
- Coffee 
- Generic thermometer
- 500ml Yeti rambler with the cup lid

I’d like to add in a dosing cup as the 1z Q can’t do 30g in one shot and I typically make 532ml of coffee. I like to at least have the flexibility to brew two cups at once when possible. Are there any recos on something that is compact and either metal or wood that could do the trick for this purpose? 

My other main concern is just how much space the v60-02 takes up. There’s kind of no good way to pack it in without what feels like a bunch of wasted space. It would be really nice to be able to carry an extra cup for whoever is with me at the time. I’m not sure I love the folding options I’ve seen but maybe there’s something I haven’t looked at, or the products I’ve seen are actually fine. Any ideas? 

Also would love general feedback. Is there anything missing? Should I do anything differently?

We talked like 20 times between meetings for up to 5 minutes over a span of a couple months. We are both in our thirties, she seems like a traditional woman and looking long-term (as am I).

Because of the work environment, I didn't ask many personal questions and I felt she was reserved about her personal life, but I cared about her projects and personally supported her when she needed it, she did the same. Now that the project is over, I thanked her and asked her out and she agreed. **There is no possibility of working together again, there are no problems with that.**

The point is, I have a date with her, there is mutual trust and understanding in a work environment, but I still don't know much about her personally yet, that is why I am asking her out right? However, I don't have much recent experience in dating since in the last years I have been very focused on my professional career. I assume she already noticed that, still, she is pretty special so I took the initiative and she agreed.

My plan is to meet her in the afternoon near her office for coffee and a walk in a park. 1h to 2h max. Something short and gentle to transition and build anticipation for the next date. **At the moment, transitioning from work to personal, light touching and a soft kiss seems like a success for a first date. I don't know if that plan could be boring, but I am focused on moving things, not rushing them.**

**I assume a beautiful woman in her mid-30s will have wide experience and (perhaps) high expectations. So I don't know if I am overthinking about a soft transition from work to platonic to romantic and I just need to act like in a normal date.** In that case, what might she expect dating a man in his mid-30s looking long-term? Again, is that plan boring and might fall into friendship?

**Any advice on this plan would be appreciated.** Otherwise you can wish me luck :D.",0,1736129734.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False
