It hasn't been kept up on since early-2021. Let's update it! 

You know that feeling when you read that 4th ""*I'm visiting Detroit, what should I do?*"" post of the week? And the comments all mention the same 2-3 things or the sidebar? Well here's your shot to add a thing or three that you wish people who visit Detroit would consider checking out!

I made a new wiki entry - the [(working) 2025 List of Things to Do](https://www.reddit.com/mod/Detroit/wiki/thingstodo/2025), in and around Detroit. I'm not as young and hip as I was messing with this list years ago, so I'd really appreciate some community input. Also, if any (*regular..ish*) users want wiki edit access to help out, please indicate so here. So far, I've only updated the museums and coffee shop sections. There are probably a lot of closed spots on the list, and I would imagine we're missing a lot of great new spots too. Please point any of those out here and I'll get them added within the week or so.

Also, if you want your business or restaurant or whatever on this list - mention it here! If it's a legit brick and mortar business, we'll include it! If you don't want to comment, a message is fine too. ",2,1749046156.0,Detroit,0,1.0,False
1l36hxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1l36hxn/i_measured_power_consumption_of_an_espresso/,[I measured] Power consumption of an espresso machine,"(for tldr jump to ‚Äúwhat I measured‚Äù)

I always wondered how much I‚Äôm paying in electricity bill for my, let‚Äôs just call it what it is, espresso habit. It‚Äôs easy to calculate cost of beans per cup or to see how much you‚Äôre paying for a machine per day of use until it breaks, but I never saw any electricity measurements.

So I got and bought a cheap measuring device from Amazon. It‚Äôs less than $20 and a great little insight in the power consumption of different gadgets I use.

Couple of notes before I start: I live in Europe and I am, of course, measuring this on our 230V grid. Power is power though. I own a Lelit Elizabeth, a dual boiler machine but it can turn off the steam boiler, so I measured both operation modes. Your consumption will vary mostly based on the size of your boiler and your temperature settings, machine‚Äôs electronics are almost an afterthought compared to heating water. I set the temperatures to 95¬∞C for the brew boiler and 135¬∞C for the steam boiler. On initial heat-up, the Elizabeth always wildly overshoots the brew temperature. I‚Äôm guessing this is to speed up the heat up of the machine or something, but it does increase the power consumption a bit too. One can do a cold flush to bring the initial overshoot down and shorten the heat-up time down a bit but I just let it do its thing. The heat-up time is measured from the completely cold machine to me starting to make coffee with it.  Power used for 1 espresso is just for fun, there‚Äôs a lot of factors that can change that measurement.


What I measured:

Steam boiler off

Heat-up time: 10min; Power used: 67Wh

1h of stand-by: 30Wh

Power used for 1 espresso: 12Wh


Steam boiler on

Heat-up time: 17min; Power used: 145Wh

1h of stand-by: 86Wh

Power used for 1 espresso: 15Wh


Peak usage when heating was exactly 1200Wh (1,2 kWh) but only for a couple of minutes. In stand-by the machine pulses the heating element on and off and it doesn‚Äôt peak as high.

What does that mean in money? That‚Äôs really hard to say because electricity costs can vary wildly from region to region. The cost per kWh can literally be a couple of pennies OR dollars, depending on your local pricing and time. At $0.4 per kWh, this machine costs about 3 cents per cold start. I make 2-3 coffees every day and I‚Äôm not heating the machine from completely cold, but generally I consume about 200-250Wh each day, totalling to around 10 cents per day. If I need the steam boiler these costs get more than doubled. Heating that amount of water to such high temperatures consumes a lot of power.",1,1749046090.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Let‚Äôs get right to the point: **this is a good readout**.

It‚Äôs not flashy, it‚Äôs not definitive, and it doesn‚Äôt come with lung function data yet ‚Äî but if you read between the lines, it tells you a lot more than most people think. It gives us real clinical evidence that efzofitimod is working early, and working systemically, in a tough patient population. It aligns perfectly with the drug‚Äôs mechanism. And most importantly, it strengthens the broader platform thesis and the probability of success heading into the big one ‚Äî the Q3 pulmonary sarcoidosis readout.

So, while this isn‚Äôt a binary outcome or an approval event, I do think it‚Äôs objectively positive. Not in a speculative kind of way ‚Äî but in the way that matters most to institutions: *does this signal biology that is reproducible, consistent, and commercially relevant across indications?* My view: yes.

Official aTyr SSC-ILD Readout (June 4, 2025):  
https://investors.atyrpharma.com/node/16556/pdf

---

Let‚Äôs get into it.

---

## 2. Quick Recap: What Was Just Announced?

On **June 4, 2025**, aTyr Pharma ($ATYR) released **interim results** from its ongoing Phase 2 trial ‚Äî EFZO-CONNECT‚Ñ¢ ‚Äî studying efzofitimod in patients with **Systemic Sclerosis‚Äìrelated Interstitial Lung Disease (SSc-ILD).**

This study is relatively small and early-stage: it‚Äôs designed as a **28-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial** in up to 25 patients, split between those with **diffuse** and **limited** SSc-ILD. What we just got is **interim data at the 12-week mark**, based on the **first 8 patients** (5 with diffuse SSc-ILD and 3 with limited SSc-ILD). The focus of this interim look was primarily on:

- **Skin fibrosis improvements**, assessed via the modified Rodnan Skin Score (**mRSS**)
- **Biomarker data**, including inflammatory markers (e.g. IFN-Œ≥, MCP-1) and disease activity markers (e.g. KL-6, SP-D)
- **Safety and tolerability** across doses

**Here are the topline outcomes in plain terms:**

- **3 of 4** diffuse SSc-ILD patients treated with efzofitimod showed a *clinically meaningful* mRSS improvement (‚â•4 points) at just **12 weeks**
- **All 8** patients (including limited SSc) showed **stable or improved mRSS**
- **Positive early trends** were observed in multiple **inflammatory and ILD-related biomarkers**
- **No treatment-related serious adverse events** were reported; drug was **well tolerated** at all doses

To put that in perspective: in this disease, clinically meaningful skin improvement usually takes **12 months** to show up ‚Äî *not 12 weeks*. That‚Äôs what makes this readout interesting. The fact that you‚Äôre seeing **rapid-onset fibrosis reversal** (in **diffuse** patients, no less) this early could be a meaningful signal of drug activity and **systemic disease modulation**.

At this stage, **lung function data hasn‚Äôt been disclosed yet** ‚Äî that comes with the **full 28-week dataset** later. But what we do have is a **mechanistically coherent, biomarker-supported, early clinical signal** in one of the hardest-to-treat subtypes of ILD.

That‚Äôs the headline. Now let‚Äôs unpack what it means.

## 3. Understanding the Disease and the Opportunity

To make sense of this readout, it helps to zoom out and understand what **SSc-ILD** actually is ‚Äî and why this readout could matter far more than the market may immediately recognize.

**Systemic sclerosis (SSc)**, also known as **scleroderma**, is a rare, autoimmune connective tissue disease. It causes widespread inflammation and fibrosis across the body ‚Äî affecting skin, blood vessels, lungs, and internal organs. When it affects the lungs, it‚Äôs referred to as **SSc-ILD (Systemic Sclerosis‚Äìassociated Interstitial Lung Disease)** ‚Äî and this lung involvement is the **number one cause of death** in patients with systemic sclerosis.

Here‚Äôs the crux: **SSc-ILD is rare, severe, progressive, and hard to treat.**

- Around **100,000 patients in the U.S.** are diagnosed with systemic sclerosis, and up to **80% develop some form of ILD**
- The most aggressive form, **diffuse SSc-ILD**, progresses rapidly and responds poorly to current treatments
- Most available therapies (e.g., **mycophenolate**, **cyclophosphamide**, and **nintedanib**) are **immunosuppressive**, carry toxicities, and are often used **off-label**
- There are **no FDA-approved therapies** specifically for treating **skin fibrosis** in systemic sclerosis, and the only approved drug for slowing lung function decline (**nintedanib**) has limited efficacy and poor tolerability

In short: patients are stuck with suboptimal options, physicians are flying blind, and drug development has mostly failed to deliver a true disease-modifying agent for this population. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs significant **unmet medical need**, and that‚Äôs also why **orphan drug** and **fast track** designations exist here ‚Äî to incentivize companies to pursue better solutions in this space.

### So, where does efzofitimod fit in?

What makes this program interesting is that efzofitimod isn‚Äôt just another immunosuppressant. It‚Äôs a **first-in-class biologic** that modulates **activated myeloid cells via neuropilin-2**, aiming to resolve inflammation **without wiping out the immune system**. That **selective mechanism** is especially relevant in SSc-ILD, where **myeloid-driven inflammation and fibrosis** are thought to play a central role.

In other words, this isn‚Äôt just a repurposing of existing mechanisms. This is a **mechanistically novel** approach in a disease where the biology, clinical outcomes, and regulatory incentives are all screaming for something better.

### Why this matters to investors:

- **Therapeutic white space**: No dominant treatment. No standard of care for reversing skin fibrosis. Huge unmet need.
- **Regulatory tailwinds**: Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations enable faster review, support discussions with the FDA, and extend commercial exclusivity if approved.
- **Market potential**: Industry analysts estimate a **$1B‚Äì$2B** addressable market in SSc-ILD alone. If lung and skin data hold up, efzofitimod could become a **first-in-class therapy** with pricing power and high barriers to entry.
- **Strategic relevance**: A win here could validate efzofitimod‚Äôs **broader potential across multiple interstitial lung diseases (ILDs)**, de-risking the entire pipeline.

The way I see it, this isn‚Äôt just a niche win for a side program. **SSc-ILD is one of the clearest high-need, low-competition therapeutic landscapes in autoimmune disease**, and aTyr may have a chance to fill that void with a differentiated mechanism. That‚Äôs why this interim data matters ‚Äî and why the **quality of the signal**, even in a small sample, is worth paying attention to.

## 4. A Closer Look at the Data

This interim readout from the Phase 2 EFZO-CONNECT trial wasn‚Äôt about lung function. It wasn‚Äôt about FVC or progression-free survival. Instead, it focused on **skin improvement** and **early biomarker shifts** ‚Äî two signals that, if meaningful, can still reshape the risk profile of the program and build scientific credibility for efzofitimod in SSc-ILD.

Let‚Äôs go through what was actually reported.

---

### Study Design and Context

- **EFZO-CONNECT** is a 28-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study
- It‚Äôs evaluating efzofitimod in SSc-ILD (both **limited and diffuse** subsets)
- Up to **25 patients** are being enrolled across the U.S.
- The **interim analysis covers 8 patients** (5 diffuse, 3 limited), assessed at 12 weeks
- **Primary efficacy endpoints** (lung function) will be assessed at 28 weeks; this readout focused on skin scores and serum biomarkers

This is a classic interim look: not powered for statistical significance, but designed to **validate mechanistic hypotheses**, confirm safety, and look for **directional signals** in a high-risk population.

---

### Headline Result: Modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS)

The **modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS)** is the standard tool for measuring skin thickness/fibrosis in systemic sclerosis. It‚Äôs widely accepted as a clinically meaningful endpoint, especially in **diffuse SSc**.

Here‚Äôs what the interim results showed:

- **All 8 patients** (efzofitimod-treated) showed **stable or improved mRSS** at Week 12
- **3 of 4 efzofitimod-treated patients with diffuse SSc-ILD** showed a **‚â•4 point improvement** in mRSS at 12 weeks
- This exceeds the **Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID)**, which is typically 4 to 6 points, often assessed at **12 months**

**Why this matters:**

- Hitting the **MCID at 12 weeks** is highly unusual ‚Äî most skin fibrosis trials hope to get there after 6‚Äì12 months
- The fact that **75% of diffuse patients** saw clinically important improvement in this short timeframe suggests a **potentially rapid onset of action**
- And importantly: **no patient got worse**. That‚Äôs stability or improvement across the board, with **signal enrichment in diffuse cases** (the harder-to-treat subset)

**Now, caveats:**

- No placebo group data was shared yet ‚Äî we can‚Äôt say for certain how much is drug effect vs natural variation or placebo response
- Only 8 patients were included ‚Äî this is extremely small and not representative
- We don‚Äôt yet know whether the **mean change**, **variance**, or **durability** will hold up at 28 weeks

But in my view, it‚Äôs directionally very promising. It gives early proof that efzofitimod may actually be doing something biologically relevant, in a population where improvements are rare.

---

### Secondary Finding: Biomarker Shifts

aTyr also reported preliminary improvements in four key biomarkers:

- **IFN-Œ≥** and **MCP-1** (inflammatory cytokines)
- **KL-6** and **SP-D** (ILD disease biomarkers)

These markers are all well-established in the literature:

- KL-6 and SP-D are used to **track disease activity in ILDs** and correlate with **alveolar epithelial damage**
- MCP-1 plays a key role in **SSc-related monocyte recruitment and fibrotic progression**
- IFN-Œ≥ is a marker of **activated macrophage response** and chronic inflammation

The shifts were described as positive ‚Äî that is, **trending in the right direction** (reduced inflammation, reduced fibrotic activation) ‚Äî though exact numerical data wasn‚Äôt provided.

**Why this matters:**

- These changes line up **exactly** with the proposed **mechanism of action**: modulation of activated myeloid cells via NRP2 to resolve inflammation
- It shows that efzofitimod isn‚Äôt just a surface-level anti-fibrotic ‚Äî it‚Äôs potentially **hitting key upstream pathways**
- Biomarker improvements **support the external validity** of the mRSS changes: it‚Äôs not just cosmetic or noise, it‚Äôs likely linked to **real biological effect**

Again, the caveat is sample size ‚Äî with 8 patients, and no numerical readouts, we can‚Äôt draw hard conclusions. But these signals support the thesis that efzofitimod is doing what it‚Äôs supposed to do, biologically speaking.

---

### Safety

- The drug was **well tolerated at all doses**
- There were **no treatment-related serious adverse events**
- Safety profile was **consistent with previous trials**

For a drug intended for **chronic use in a fragile population**, this is critical. Safety issues are one of the most common reasons systemic sclerosis programs fail ‚Äî and efzofitimod continues to pass this bar cleanly.

---

### What‚Äôs missing?

To be balanced, here‚Äôs what we **didn‚Äôt** see ‚Äî and what we‚Äôll need to look for in the **full 28-week readout**:

- No **FVC or lung function** data yet ‚Äî this is the big one
- No **placebo arm comparison** was shared in this interim
- No **statistical analysis or mean/SD data** was reported ‚Äî so we don‚Äôt know distribution or robustness
- **Durability is still unknown** ‚Äî will these Week 12 improvements hold, deepen, or reverse?

---

**In sum:** the data is **early**, **limited**, and **directional** ‚Äî but it‚Äôs **clean**, **biologically aligned**, and **clinically relevant**. For a Phase 2 interim readout in SSc-ILD, this is about as constructive as it gets.

## 5. How Strong Is This Signal, Really?

Let‚Äôs be honest: a dataset with only eight patients would normally be easy to dismiss. Small-*n* readouts often raise more questions than answers.

But in my view, this one lands a bit differently ‚Äî not because of the size, but because of **how cohesive and aligned the story is**.

---

### Let‚Äôs break down the key signal-strength factors:

---

**1. Directional Consistency**

Every patient either **improved or stayed stable** on mRSS. That‚Äôs a **100% rate of no decline** ‚Äî and in **diffuse SSc**, where worsening is common, that‚Äôs meaningful. The fact that **3 out of 4 diffuse patients** had **clinically meaningful mRSS improvement** adds signal richness in the subgroup that matters most.

> In other words: this wasn‚Äôt a scattered or noisy result ‚Äî it was clean, directional, and focused on the hardest-to-treat group.

---

**2. Early Onset**

Achieving **‚â•4-point mRSS improvements by Week 12** is not typical. Many systemic sclerosis trials don‚Äôt show separation until 6 to 12 months. The early onset is suggestive of **real biological activity**, not regression to the mean.

> In my view, early response is particularly valuable in this disease ‚Äî because the longer fibrosis goes unchecked, the harder it is to reverse.

---

**3. Biomarker Concordance**

We didn‚Äôt just get clinical observations ‚Äî we also got **biomarker shifts** that **track with the drug‚Äôs proposed MOA**. That‚Äôs critical for credibility.

> This matters to institutional analysts. Biomarker concordance suggests we‚Äôre not just seeing noise or placebo, but a **mechanism-based effect**. That helps **de-risk the biology**.

---

**4. Disease Context**

SSc-ILD is a **devastating, progressive disease** with **no FDA-approved first-line treatment** for skin and lung fibrosis together. A drug that can show early, sustained anti-fibrotic activity ‚Äî with **no immune suppression** ‚Äî fills a massive unmet need.

> The bar for statistical power is lower in this context. Regulators, patients, and clinicians are desperate for new mechanisms ‚Äî especially ones that spare the immune system. So even small trials can shift sentiment if the signals are right.

---

### But let‚Äôs also be honest about the limits:

- **No placebo data** shown yet. This could still be regression to the mean.
- **No statistical variance** reported. We don‚Äôt know how wide the spread was.
- **No lung data**. mRSS is important ‚Äî but lung function will determine regulatory value.
- **No durability yet**. Week 12 is exciting. But if it doesn‚Äôt hold at Week 28, the whole story shifts.

---

### My View: A Moderate-to-Strong Early Signal

Would this be a registrational readout? **No.**

But is it enough to:
- De-risk the **mechanism of action**?
- Reinforce the **clinical relevance** of efzofitimod in fibrotic disease?
- Justify **Phase 3 planning** and expanded investment?
- Strengthen the **scientific narrative** going into the **Q3 pulmonary sarcoidosis readout**?

**Yes ‚Äî and I‚Äôd argue convincingly so.**

> In biotech, a strong early signal isn‚Äôt about p-values. It‚Äôs about **biological coherence**, **directionality**, and **alignment with unmet need**. This checks those boxes better than most interim readouts I‚Äôve seen.

## 6. Implications for aTyr‚Äôs Broader Pipeline

Let‚Äôs step back.

This wasn‚Äôt just an eight-patient readout in a rare autoimmune lung disease. It was a **strategic unlock** that, in my view, strengthens the **scientific and commercial foundations** of aTyr‚Äôs entire platform.

Why?

Because it‚Äôs the **first external clinical proof** that efzofitimod is biologically active **beyond sarcoidosis**. And that has major implications for the company‚Äôs multi-indication strategy.

---

### 1. Multi-Indication Validation Is Now Real, Not Hypothetical

Until now, aTyr‚Äôs case for efzofitimod outside sarcoidosis was mostly mechanistic:

- ‚ÄúWe believe NRP2 is expressed in other ILDs.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWe think macrophage-driven inflammation applies to scleroderma too.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen signs in preclinical models.‚Äù

That was the pitch. But this readout makes it **real**.

Now they can say: *‚ÄúWe‚Äôve observed clinical and biomarker activity in SSc-ILD patients.‚Äù* That‚Äôs a **shift in credibility**. It tells both investors and regulators that efzofitimod is **not a single-indication bet** ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **platform drug with immunological breadth**.

> That could significantly increase the company‚Äôs **optional value**.

---

### 2. Increased Confidence Heading into Phase 3 Sarcoidosis Readout

The Phase 3 EFZO-FIT trial in **pulmonary sarcoidosis** is the **primary valuation driver** for aTyr right now. That readout is due in **Q3** ‚Äî meaning we are **weeks away** from the most important moment in the company‚Äôs history.

So why does this SSc-ILD data matter?

Because the signal strength, safety profile, and MOA alignment observed here **bolster confidence** that efzofitimod is doing what it‚Äôs supposed to do, across diseases.

In my view, this **de-risks the sarcoidosis readout** in two key ways:

- It confirms **translatability**: the drug works in a second fibrotic ILD setting.
- It reinforces **safety**: no new issues emerged in a tougher autoimmune population.

> Investors should think of this as a **warm-up readout** that sets the tone ‚Äî and the tone is positive.

---

### 3. Expanding the TAM: From Single Drug to Multi-Indication Franchise

Efzofitimod is now showing promise in:

- **Pulmonary sarcoidosis** (Phase 3; readout Q3 2025)
- **Systemic sclerosis-associated ILD** (Phase 2; interim readout just dropped)
- **Potentially other ILDs** where NRP2+ macrophages are implicated

And this is all on top of the company‚Äôs:

- Preclinical **oncology assets** (ATYR2810)
- Earlier pipeline leveraging **tRNA synthetase biology**

From a **platform perspective**, this SSC-ILD readout could help transform aTyr‚Äôs perception from:

> ‚ÄúA small company with a risky sarcoidosis readout‚Ä¶‚Äù

to

> ‚ÄúA high-science ILD platform company with multi-indication potential.‚Äù

That matters for future **licensing, M&A, and institutional interest**. And it‚Äôs exactly what large-cap biotech and pharma want to see in this deal-making climate.

---

### 4. Pipeline Confidence Supports Commercial Readiness

It‚Äôs worth noting: aTyr has already **appointed a Head of Commercial** for efzofitimod. That‚Äôs not something you do if you‚Äôre uncertain.

This readout justifies that move. It reinforces that efzofitimod could become a **real product**, not just a clinical concept.

**Commercial readiness** isn‚Äôt about ads ‚Äî it‚Äôs about:

- Mapping **payer strategy**
- Building **KOL relationships**
- Laying the groundwork for **market access**

This readout gives the internal team a **new story to tell** ‚Äî and that matters in meetings with physicians, regulators, and commercial partners.

---

### My View: A Subtle but Significant Platform Unlock

This isn‚Äôt a fireworks moment. But it‚Äôs a **foundation-laying one**.

- It strengthens the story going into **Q3**.
- It adds credibility to the idea that efzofitimod has **immunological breadth**.
- It supports the valuation framework that aTyr could own **multiple indications in fibrotic ILD**.

> For a company trading around a ~$500M market cap with ~$80M in cash, this kind of multi-indication signal could unlock **meaningful re-rating potential** ‚Äî *if* Phase 3 delivers.

## 7. What Still Needs to Be Proven

As positive as this readout is, there‚Äôs a difference between **signal** and **certainty**. And while this interim analysis provides signal ‚Äî strong signal, in my view ‚Äî there‚Äôs still a long way to go before efzofitimod is a validated therapy in SSc-ILD or broader ILD markets.

Here‚Äôs what still needs to be proven:

---

### 1. Impact on Lung Function

This is the elephant in the room.

The interim readout focused on skin involvement, using the modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS). And that‚Äôs valuable ‚Äî especially in diffuse SSc, where skin disease is often severe and progressive.

But this is an ILD study.

The **primary endpoint** of the full EFZO-CONNECT study is pulmonary: change in % predicted **forced vital capacity (FVC)**. That‚Äôs the clinical gold standard for assessing disease progression in SSc-ILD.

As of this interim readout, we have **zero data on FVC**. No trendline. No directional insight. Just skin and biomarker data ‚Äî and while those are highly encouraging, they are surrogate markers, not the primary endpoint.

**So what?**

Without FVC data, we can‚Äôt yet answer the most important question for regulators, payers, or physicians:

> **Does efzofitimod meaningfully alter the course of lung decline in SSc-ILD patients?**

Until that‚Äôs addressed, this remains an early but incomplete story.

---

### 2. Durability of Effect

Another key limitation: this is a **12-week interim readout** from a **28-week study**.

In SSc-ILD ‚Äî a chronic, progressive disease ‚Äî what matters most is **durability**. Can the early skin improvements hold over 6+ months? Do biomarker changes continue to track in the right direction? Do any unexpected safety signals emerge with longer exposure?

The full readout will tell us more. But for now, all we know is that **early signals look good** ‚Äî not whether they **sustain**.

---

### 3. Statistical Power and Sample Size

The interim cohort was tiny:

- 8 total patients  
- 5 with diffuse SSc  
- 3 with limited SSc  

With 3 of 4 evaluable diffuse SSc patients showing ‚â•4-point mRSS improvement, that‚Äôs a **clinically strong signal**. But statistically? We‚Äôre deep into **anecdata** territory here.

That‚Äôs not a knock ‚Äî it‚Äôs just reality. No matter how compelling the directionality, **eight patients is not enough** to infer population-level efficacy.

**So what?**

Until we see *n* values in the double digits and ideally comparative arms, this readout should be viewed as **hypothesis-generating**, not **confirmatory**.

---

### 4. Translating Biomarker Signals into Clinical Outcomes

There were early improvements in biomarkers:

- KL-6  
- SP-D  
- MCP-1  
- IFN-Œ≥  

All good signs. But there are no quantified changes, no error bars, no statistical context. And we haven‚Äôt seen how those correlate (if at all) with FVC or other hard endpoints.

**Biomarkers are supportive, not determinative.** Their utility is to reinforce what‚Äôs seen clinically ‚Äî not replace it.

So until we see pulmonary data, these shifts ‚Äî while positive ‚Äî are best viewed as **biological breadcrumbs**, not full validation.

---

### 5. Comparative Efficacy

There‚Äôs **no placebo arm reported** in this interim. And while we can infer that most or all patients received efzofitimod (given it‚Äôs a blinded study and only the active arm is described), we can‚Äôt yet:

- Compare vs. background MMF or CYC  
- Isolate effect size vs. natural history  
- Control for regression to the mean  

**So what?**

We don‚Äôt know how efzofitimod stacks up against standard of care. And that‚Äôs essential if the company wants to move toward registrational discussions ‚Äî especially for a rare indication where small trials are the norm.

---

### 6. Long-Term Safety

The drug has been well tolerated to date ‚Äî including across sarcoidosis and SSC-ILD. But **safety is a moving target**, especially when:

- Administered chronically  
- In combination with immunosuppressants  
- In autoimmune populations with multi-organ involvement  

We‚Äôve seen no red flags. But **long-term safety** will remain a watch item ‚Äî particularly if aTyr begins planning longer trials or commercial expansion.

---

### My View: A Strong Step, But Not the Finish Line

This readout is a **strategic win**. It adds confidence, adds optionality, adds momentum.

But it is not the endgame. It‚Äôs not yet proof that efzofitimod will improve lung function in SSc-ILD ‚Äî or that regulators will consider these early skin improvements sufficient for accelerated paths.

> **Investors should celebrate the signal ‚Äî while staying grounded in what still needs to be shown.**

## 8. Strategic and Market Implications

The SSC-ILD interim readout isn‚Äôt just a clinical signal ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **strategic signal**. It tells the market something about the depth of aTyr‚Äôs platform, the optionality of efzofitimod, and the company‚Äôs execution strategy heading into the pivotal months ahead.

Let‚Äôs break down what this really means for $ATYR.

---

### 1. It Deepens the Platform, Not Just the Program

In my view, this readout helps reposition efzofitimod not just as a *‚Äúsarcoidosis drug‚Äù* ‚Äî but as a **systemic inflammation and fibrosis drug**.

- It works in pulmonary sarcoidosis (Phase 3 near completion).  
- It shows effect in skin fibrosis in diffuse SSc.  
- It modulates inflammatory and fibrotic biomarkers systemically.  

**What‚Äôs the bigger picture?**

Efzofitimod is proving itself in organ systems that are functionally and anatomically distinct ‚Äî the lungs and the skin ‚Äî but pathologically linked through chronic inflammation and myeloid activation.

That supports a much broader platform vision, where **NRP2 modulation** could be relevant across a swath of ILDs, autoimmune disorders, and fibrotic diseases.

**So what?**  
It opens up the possibility for label expansion, follow-on indications, and multi-billion-dollar TAMs. It also strengthens the scientific case behind efzofitimod‚Äôs novel mechanism ‚Äî and gives institutional investors more to believe in.

---

### 2. It Enhances aTyr‚Äôs Negotiating Leverage

Whether aTyr stays independent or is acquired post-Phase 3, this readout strengthens its negotiating position.

**Why?**

- It de-risks the asset beyond just sarcoidosis.  
- It validates a second orphan indication.  
- It shows early signals of efficacy and safety in another rare, high-need market.  

Imagine you‚Äôre a large-cap pharma watching this unfold. You‚Äôre not just seeing a single Phase 3 program anymore ‚Äî you‚Äôre seeing a **multi-indication pipeline**, with strong early wins in two difficult diseases, both without robust standard of care.

That makes aTyr a more compelling target ‚Äî whether for licensing, partnership, or outright M&A.

---

### 3. It Buys Time ‚Äî and Sets the Narrative ‚Äî Ahead of Phase 3

The SSC-ILD interim readout dropped in early June, right before the **3-month window** opens for the EFZO-FIT Phase 3 sarcoidosis readout (due in Q3).

That timing isn‚Äôt accidental. In my view, it‚Äôs a **strategic narrative move**.

- aTyr now has something fresh and positive to say to analysts, investors, and potential partners in June.  
- It provides momentum heading into **Jefferies**, **BIO**, and the Phase 3 anticipation cycle.  
- It deflects attention from dilution anxiety by re-anchoring the story on **clinical data**.

**So what?**  
This allows aTyr to **control the conversation** in June and early July ‚Äî rather than letting price action drift aimlessly while the market waits for Q3.

---

### 4. It Reinforces a Biotech Playbook: De-Risk, Then Scale

This readout is textbook biotech execution:

- Prove the MOA in one indication (sarcoidosis)  
- Expand to a second (SSc-ILD) with overlapping biology  
- Generate early readout signals before Phase 3 lands  
- Build a broader story for institutional capital to anchor to  

In other words, this isn‚Äôt just a good clinical update ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **smart strategic move**, timed to create multiple shots on goal and buy-in from long-term funds.

---

### 5. It Strengthens the Case for High-Conviction Ownership

This kind of progress matters to high-conviction institutional holders. Not just because of the upside ‚Äî but because of the **risk reduction**.

The more independent clinical signals that validate efzofitimod across organ systems, the **less binary the stock becomes**.

And for long-only healthcare funds, that kind of de-risking matters deeply. It means they can increase position size. It means analysts can rerun their models. It means PMs can back the name with more confidence.

---

### 6. It Could Drive Institutional Accumulation Before Q3

There‚Äôs a window here.

If you‚Äôre an institutional investor:

- You know the Phase 3 readout is coming in Q3.  
- You just saw early efficacy and clean safety in SSC-ILD.  
- You‚Äôre seeing insider buying (Jane Gross in March).  
- You know float is low, borrow is expensive, and retail is getting loud.  

**Put all of that together**, and this readout could serve as a **catalyst for pre-readout institutional positioning** ‚Äî especially if funds start seeing this as a platform bet, not just a single-readout trade.

---

### My View: A Strategic Masterstroke

This readout doesn‚Äôt just move the science forward ‚Äî it moves the **story** forward.

It strengthens the clinical case, yes ‚Äî but more than that, it strengthens the **framing**, the **timing**, and the **strategic posture** of aTyr as it enters its most important quarter ever.

And for a $5 stock with a $500M market cap and two rare disease indications in motion?

> **That‚Äôs a potent mix.**

## 9. Final Thoughts & Takeaways

So ‚Äî is the SSC-ILD interim readout good news?

**Yes. In my view, it‚Äôs very good news.**

Not in a *‚Äúbreak out the champagne, we‚Äôve cured scleroderma‚Äù* kind of way ‚Äî but in a strategically timed, clinically meaningful, risk-lowering, platform-reinforcing kind of way.

Let me leave you with a few takeaways that I think matter most:

---

### It shows clinical signal in another tough disease

- **mRSS improvement ‚â•4 points** in 3 of 4 diffuse SSc-ILD patients is highly encouraging, especially at 12 weeks (not 12 months).  
- All patients had **stable or improved skin scores**.  
- Biomarker movement was **consistent with efzofitimod‚Äôs known MOA**.

That‚Äôs a real signal. And in a disease as complex and heterogeneous as SSc-ILD, that kind of consistency ‚Äî even in 8 patients ‚Äî is impressive.

---

### It confirms safety, again

The drug remains **safe and well tolerated**. That matters ‚Äî especially in chronic, immunologically complex diseases like this.

A clean safety profile opens the door to **long-term use**, **regulatory flexibility**, and **greater patient trust**.

---

### It validates the idea that efzofitimod is not just a sarcoidosis drug

This was the missing piece for many institutions.  
Could this MOA extend across diseases? Could this be more than a one-and-done program?

This readout answers that: **yes, it can**.

And that changes how investors view the **risk/reward calculus** of $ATYR ‚Äî it becomes **less binary**, more **platform-like**.

---

### It couldn‚Äôt have come at a better time

- We‚Äôre entering the **Q3 readout window** for EFZO-FIT (pulmonary sarcoidosis)  
- Conferences like **Jefferies** and **BIO** are ramping  
- **Short interest remains elevated**  
- **Institutional interest is quietly increasing**  

This gives the company ‚Äî and the market ‚Äî something **real and credible** to anchor to in the meantime.

---

### It‚Äôs a classic biotech de-risking moment

You want to know what good biotech looks like?

It looks like this:

- Hit your timelines  
- Show multi-indication relevance  
- Deliver early, clean data in high-need diseases  
- Stay focused and capital efficient  
- Build the case one milestone at a time  

That‚Äôs what aTyr is doing.  
And in my opinion, this readout will be looked back on ‚Äî **post-Phase 3** ‚Äî as the moment the story started to feel *bigger than just sarcoidosis*.

---

### In summary:

This was a **smart, well-timed, and genuinely positive** readout.

It helps frame efzofitimod as a platform.  
It reduces scientific risk.  
It expands the story.  
And it buys strategic time going into the **most important catalyst** of the company‚Äôs life: the **Phase 3 readout this quarter**.

Is it definitive? No.  
But it‚Äôs **directional**. And it points the right way.

1l36abi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1l36abi/my_friend_tried_to_move_in_to_my_room_with_my/,"My ""friend"" tried to move in to my room with my family when I went away to college.","Hey guys! (Charlotte if you read this I LOVE your videos). 

When I (25 f) was in high school I (18 at the time) had this friend (18 at the time f) (we will call K) who I would hang out with occasionally. We had similar interests like art and creative writing so we got along pretty well at first. We would go out for coffee or to the library or just hang out. I noticed after a while whenever we would go out K would always ""forget her wallet."" 

Just for a little context as I believe this is the reason she would ""forget her wallet"" is that she was raised by her grandmother and great grandmother who were both living off their retirement funds, but spoiled K with whatever she wanted. K did not have a job or a driver's licence. Nor was she trying to get either. (we lived in a small country town in the US that did not have many busses at the time so driving was essential)

I on the other hand, have a family that is fairly well off and we lived in a comfortable home (that's how she saw me, but my parents money is not mine). I worked two jobs so that I could spend money how I pleased. 

Now I'm not the type to mind paying for friends, but did not want my friends to expect me to pay for things. My friendship with K got to the point that whenever she wanted to hang out with me I knew that she really just wanted me to drive her somewhere or buy her something, so I slowly backed away from the friendship as I did not want to be used like that. 

A few months passed and I moved out of my parents home to go live with my brother to attend college in the town where he lived. Only a couple of weeks after I moved, I got a message from K. 

She said her mom (who occasionally popped up, but was not a big part of K's life) gave her a kitten but her grandmother and great-grandmother said she could not keep it as they lived in an apartment that did not allow pets and they knew that K was not responsible enough to care for it.

K not knowing how to handle being told ""no"" decided that she would move out, and texted me to see if she could live in my room in my parents house since I was ""no longer using it"" just so that she could keep the cat.

I was in absolute disbelief. She promised she wouldn't cause any issues and wouldn't need anything from my parents. She said she just needed a place to stay. 

I knew better. My parent's home is outside of town and there weren't any bus stops near it at the time. K also still did not have a job and leaving her grandmothers meant they would no longer give her money. 

This meant that she would need people to drive her places and buy her food and cook for her (she didn't know how to cook). not to mention that she wanted to bring a cat into a house that already had two dogs and a cat. 

I took my time responding to make sure I told her everything as clearly but kindly as possible.

I ended up sending a very long message along the lines of:

 ""I can not make that decision as it is not my house, it is my parent's house. I will also not be asking for their permission as I do not think it is appropriate to do so. My parents cannot drive you places or buy and cook food for you, nor would I ever ask them too. As your friend I will give you this advice: if you want a cat so badly, you should get a job and your own apartment. Stop relying on others to provide for you. Your grandmothers don't want you to have a cat for a reason. You should consider what their reason is and if you still don't agree, then work toward getting your own place so you can have a cat.""

She ended up telling me that I am a terrible friend and I must have never actually liked her. I ended up blocking her because I didn't want to deal with her emotional manipulation. I never spoke to her again though she did try contacting me on Facebook a few times, I just ignored her. 

I see her from time to time when I go visit my family (because it is such a small town you can't help but run into people you know) but I always just ignored her and she always glares at me. 

I live across the ocean in the UK now with my wonderful husband and our precious kitty (who we worked hard to get and provide for in our own house) <3  
  
Hope you enjoyed this dramatic story. In small towns you are more likely to run into the odd people so I have more stories from when I lived there that I may share another time!

Love you Charlotte!

My family and I are planning a trip to Costa Rica in  December/January. We are parents to college-aged kids so it will be mid-50's parents plus early 20's adult(ish) children. We will have one week (unless I can talk the spouse into a longer trip). Days 1 and 7 will be  travel, so 5 days in Costa Rica.  We are active and adventurous, but two of us are slightly  more adventurous. We will be renting a car and driving ourselves. One of the children is 1/2 through a wildlife biology degree, and we are all interested in eco-tourism, so animal spotting is high on the list.

Mom wants (and when Mom is happy everyone is happy) a day of snorkeling at the beach.  We want adventure but not to be so booked we don't have time to relax, so we are probably looking at two rather than three areas to visit.

We will most likely fly in and out of San Jose. So, do we do San Jose to Monteverde and then Manuel Antonio or San Jose to La Fortuna and then Manuel Antonio or is there something else to consider?

The must haves are:  1) All the wildlife  2) snorkeling and beach for at least a day  3) coffee plantation 3) hiking   Other things that are nice are 4) river float or white water rafting 4) hot springs. 5) Waterfalls The hanging bridges look cool but one of the party has a deathly fear of heights, so I'm not sure how that will go.

Our tour took us from SJ to Tortuguero, back to SJ, to La Fortuna, to Monteverde, back to SJ.

Day 1: Arrive in San Jose, stay at hotel near central market. Plans are to relax after flight, go to market, walk around town.

Day 2: Get rental car (probably Alamo, seems okay, good deal, can book thru travel card website, gets us insurance taken care of) just gonna get a Toyota cross or similar, no need for 4x4, if we find a road that needs that, we shouldn't be on it. Drive to La Fortuna. Staying just on north edge of town.

Day 3: Ecoglide Ziplines, seems very beginner and family friendly.

Day 4: Baldi Hot Springs, went last time, seems like the best family friendly place, plan to go in morning and then evening, eat back in town somewhere.

Day 5: Travel to Monteverde, stay in hotel on south edge of town.

Day 6: Morning, Don Juan chocolate, sugar, coffee tour with later a night walk also with Don Juan, part of package.

Day 7: Travel to Manual Antonio, staying near park.

Day 8: MA park in morning, booked a reputable guide. Mangrove boat tour with dinner in the evening (may switch this to day 10).

Day 9: Day trip to Uvita for whale boat tour.

Day 10: Chill out at beach in Quepos/MA area.

Day 11: Chill out at beach in Quepos/MA area.

Day 12: Travel back to SJ (hopefully catch a soccer match on Sunday, schedule isn't released yet, last time we saw Sporting host LDA)

Day 13: SJ markets in morning, flight in evening.

I've been in a really complicated relationship with someone. We met through our parents, and since then, we've become close friends. We go to church together, message each other constantly, share coffee, meals, secrets, plans ‚Äî even our darkest thoughts. There was a strong connection between us from the beginning.

But things got complicated when we started sleeping together. That‚Äôs when we began acting like a couple and became more emotionally and physically intimate. He would say things that made me feel like he wanted more than what we had ‚Äî like there was potential for something deeper.

I wanted more, something serious, which he said he couldn‚Äôt give ‚Äî but I stayed, and he wanted me to stay - hoping that somehow it could still turn into more. There have been moments of coldness and withdrawal from him, followed by warmth and affection again. The emotional rollercoaster ‚Äî the tension, the make-ups ‚Äî all made me believe there might be something real here.

Now, I‚Äôm starting to wonder if my behavior and emotional intensity around this are signs of a manic or hypomanic episode, or if this is just typical emotional confusion from being in a messy situationship. I‚Äôve been impulsive, overly attached, constantly seeking validation, and acting in ways that don‚Äôt feel like me.

At a physical in mid-April, her BP was 140/90.  Doctor said he wasn't concerned and told her to come back in two weeks to measure again.  She went back and it was again 140/90.  He told her to order a home BP and monitor it.

She did and it arrived on May 1.  I was at golf and saw I had a text from her saying ""call me please.""  She said her BP was 219/111, but she felt perfectly fine.  I came home and she had gotten a couple more similar readings.  We thought maybe we had a bad machine and we tried it on me.  It was normal.  We went to urgent care and they got multiple readings of \~220/110.

She was prescribed Losartan (50mg, then to 100mg a week later when BP was till high) and now 5mg of Amlodipine.  

We're going through all the normal kidney, thyroid, heart tests to check for the normal secondary causes of hypertension and every test so far has come back normal.

She takes her BP twice daily and gets readings anywhere from ""normal"" (\~120/80) to high (\~160/100) seemingly randomly.

She feels great.  She works out regularly, eats well, is thin (5'8"", 140lbs) and is high energy.

How can a person with 59 years of normal blood pressure get extreme hypertension over the course of six weeks?

We've ruled out: Cushings, Renal Artery Stenosis, Primary Aldosteronism, Pheochromocytoma, thyrotoxicosis.  She has very mild sleep apnea; we've done EKG, tested Troponin.  She's not on any medications or taking allergy medicines.  She's stopped drinking caffeinated coffee and has stopped alcohol (she was a light drinker anyway).

1l366gc,https://i.redd.it/fs9m4yqf1x4f1.jpeg,MANDATORY BUYING ALERT: USAU Just Added to Russell 2000 and 3000 - ETFs Must Buy,"USAU officially joins the Russell 2000 and 3000 indexes on June 30, 2025. This means passive funds tracking these indexes are legally required to buy shares with no exceptions.

Key Points:

* ETFs mandated to buy: IWM (about 620,000 shares) VTWO (about 112,000 shares) IWV (about 12,000 shares) VTHR (about 1,200 shares) TWOK (about 5,000 shares) URTY (about 4,000 shares) Total estimated shares to be bought is around 755,000, which is about 7 percent of USAU‚Äôs float.
* Why it matters: Funds have zero choice and must buy at market price. Institutional ownership is currently only 14.42 percent, so large buying pressure is expected. CK Gold Project is valued at 4.75 billion dollars, but USAU‚Äôs market cap is only about 144 million dollars ‚Äî a huge undervaluation.
* Expected price action: Volatility as ETFs accumulate shares. Every dip is a chance to buy cheap before the price rises. Target price is 17 to 25 dollars or more within 30 days, which means 35 to 100 percent upside.

Quick Take:

Index inclusion means guaranteed forced buying, which usually leads to a predictable short-term price increase.

If you want to participate, buy shares before ETFs finish rebalancing on June 30.

This is not speculation - it‚Äôs a mechanical, time-bound mandate driving demand.

1l366d7,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1l366d7/is_this_an_appropriate_behaviour_from_my_boss/,Is this an appropriate behaviour from my boss?,"I've worked at my current company for 3 years and it's my first job after graduation. During that time, I've seen behaviour from him that doesn't show proper leadership (Btw, he's in his late 50s to early 60s): 

**1) My boss is not punctual and would not stay at the office for very long**

The boss of the company I worked would come to the office 9 AM (though it's rare tbh) to 10:30 AM and would leave at 12:00 AM to 2:00 PM at most unless something urgent/important comes up. In the beginning, I go curious so I asked my coworkers whom have worked longer/is closer to my boss than me if he has some sort of other work that he has to do in the afternoon. However, they told me that the boss just went home and he has told us several instances that he was going home whenever he leaves the office (so basically he works maybe 3-5 hours a day). 

**2) I have not seen him being productive as much as I would expect a boss would**

During my employment at this company, the day-to-day operations are basically overseen by the operations manager (who is basically the 2nd-in-command of the company) and the decisions/queries would mostly go to him. However, whenever the boss comes to work, he would yell at the operations manager half the time for some mistakes (everyone can hear since it's a small office and there are only like 30 people working in that branch) and I don't really see him work much albeit I don't monitor his schedule/work. There was several times where he would spend 30 minutes to 1 hour to brag people around the office about some machine he bought in China for the office to use (coffee machine, water heater, etc.).  

**3) ""Business trips""**

My boss would go on ""business trips"" to countries like Japan, America and Europe. We do have clients in those places and he would go there to meet with them but those business trips would take 2 weeks to 1 month. 2 years ago he went around Italy as part of his business trip (yes, my operation manager told me at the time that my boss was a business trip) for a whole month and some of my coworkers who friended him on Facebook would show everyone pics of him traveling in Italy. I would understand if he was also taking his vacation after meeting with the clients but he would take these ""business trips"" 3-4 times a year. 

Sorry for sounding like a rant, but as someone who just started his career, I just find my boss's behaviour as weird and lack of responsibility. I understand that this is just from my own perspective and from what I've heard/discussed with my coworkers but I find it hard to believe that he's being effective or a motivating boss when he acts like this and my coworkers would say the same thing. The reason I stayed for so long was because he doesn't yell at me (tbf, the only people whom he works with in the office are the people with senior roles or the secretary) and the company is close to my apartment. I got a job offer and have handed in my resignation. I just wanted to talk about it here since I am just so flabbergasted with this.",1,1749045275.0,jobs,0,1.0,False

* Protein shake with hydrolyzed iso whey protein (25gr of protein 1 gr of carbs).

  The library was mostly empty the next time I visited it, I came to drop off the books I had blazed through during my nights sleeping in the hay in the loft above Decepero and the other creatures in their stalls. 

  I wasn‚Äôt the only one who slept up here, there were others and they hated it when I left the lamp on for too long. Sometimes they would ask me to read below and I would sit with Dece in her stall when it was clean enough otherwise I would lay on the bench just outside it.
  I had decided to make it a habit to get her out and go for a ride every other day or every three days, but the staff also made sure to let her out in the paddocks everyday that I was gone and I would have to bring her back in when I arrived back.

  The only librarian behind their great long desk today seemed to light up when she saw me. My mind raced with why that could be and so I was quite wary when I walked over to her. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúYes, hi, are you miss Kayara?‚Äù She asked, shocking me. Oh heavens what have you done now?
  ‚ÄúI am. Why? What have you heard?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúOh um‚Ä¶‚Äù She looked at me warily now which offered me some hope. ‚ÄúNothing dear, I was given a letter for you‚Äì It‚Äôs from the palace!‚Äù She hissed the last part, clearly trying to be subtle about it and failing.
  ‚ÄúW-Oh gods‚Ä¶‚Äù I snatched it from her hand and tore it open immediately. Nothing ever came from those who wore crowns.

    Kayara,
       I hear you know books, do you like tea?
    The staff will let you in through a backway at the change of yellow to lime light. Do not be late or my selected guide may be busy and unable to let you in.
     I look forward to meeting you.      ‚Äì   Ana.
 There was another page with a hastily scrawled map that showed me where to go that wasn‚Äôt the main entrance.
  There was an air of command in the words that told me I didn‚Äôt want to disobey whoever the fuck this was- I swore quickly to the heavens and the gods that had abandoned us, that if it was charmer I would kill myself.
 
 ‚ÄúWhat does it say?‚Äù The librarian asked, unable to contain her lust for information. I pitied her, knowing I‚Äôm the same and also suspecting that it would be a mistake to tell her.

  ‚ÄúI carved some flowers into a table and I forgot to pick up my money‚Ä¶ I guess they really do, do their due diligence if they knew where to find me.‚Äù I shrugged and shoved the letter into my tunic pocket with my notebook. ‚ÄúI finished these and I‚Äôll probably be back later to find more.‚Äù I said curtly before leaving for the palace, I could probably make it before the guide went off duty‚Ä¶ Right?

  The lighter green light, chartreuse or lime, began at midday. Whomever this Ana person was wanted to have lunch with me, not just tea.
  Unless she was one of those snobby, bored rich girls who only ate things in liquid form. Maybe she was a servant or lower vassal since she hadn‚Äôt used any overbearing long-ass names that most courtiers went by.

  Or maybe she wished to be discreet.

  I had plenty of time to stew over it on my way up the goddesses inner chest and to the Palace. It wasn‚Äôt too far from the heart where the library dwelled in what would be the apex, but the public could not access the university from the library and the university had a private access point to the palace which would have shortened my journey significantly!

  Instead I got to find out that the farther up one went, the easier it was to navigate. Still difficult, as I had never been up here in the two weeks I‚Äôd been in the city but much easier than even the routes I had been using daily since my arrival.
   
  Finally I made it to the plain, rounded, door that had been drawn on the map. There was a sign that said ‚ÄúStaff Only‚Äù written over the arched top. 
  
  ‚ÄúMust be the right place.‚Äù I muttered to myself and knocked. 
  The door opened a moment later and a stout old man greeted me with an unimpressed look, his bushy eyebrows raising expectantly. 
  Behind me, the lights finally turned yellow and it must have dawned on him that I had been invited to this door. He nodded me in.

  It wasn't exactly the palace's proper entrance, just one of the shortcuts up to it. There was still a long walk up several flights of stairs and then through kitchens and washing rooms and up more stairs. 
  ‚ÄúYou cannot see her dressed like this, and your bags must be checked too. I will leave you with miss Weiry and her girls.‚Äù He said before opening a door to a brightly lit room and gesturing for me to enter. 
  
  The door shut behind me, almost harshly, and then I was being stared at expectantly by several more people. 
  ‚ÄúKayara?‚Äù said the lady in the only outfit that didn't look identical to the rest. Likely the foretold Miss Weiry. 

  ‚ÄúPresent?‚Äù my voice cracked. 

  ‚ÄúUndress and we will wash you, you cannot meet with her while smelling like the sewers.‚Äù 

  I hadn't been washed by anyone else's hands since I was a child, the High Lady Ptula had never decided I needed personal maids or anything. 
  ‚ÄúCan I wash myself?‚Äù 

  ‚ÄúWe have to make sure you don't carry any weapons of any kind.‚Äù
  
  ‚ÄúRight. Of course.‚Äù 

  They directed me to put my boots and my satchel on the table in the center of the room. Then I watched as they rifled through ny things, some with care and some with clear boredom. 

  ‚ÄúClothes next.‚Äù She said and I obeyed. Some of the girls helped me into the tub and began scrubbing my dirt-worn skin. 
  I had naturally tanned skin, a bronzy-gold tone, but I guess the bathhouses I had been visiting weren't enough to totally rid me of my journey's dirt. 
  My hair became a shade brighter, and lighter on my scalp. They didn't try to cut it thank the gods but they did cure my nails which I was also grateful for since I had been lazy with them and the cracking was beginning to annoy me. 

  ‚ÄúIs she‚Ä¶‚Äù I didn't know quite what I wanted to ask but one of the woman said ‚ÄúShe is lovely at heart, truly, but she and her HandMaidens can be a bit intense at times.‚Äù 
  Her words didn't comfort me.

  ‚ÄúOk, thanks for the heads up.‚Äù

  When I had dried off and dressed in the daygown they had selected for me, the butler returned to guide me to the mysterious lady. Finally!

  The pale-ish pink fabric was stiff but soft. Clean cut and unadorned, it felt slightly too small for my toned physique. My biceps alone threatened the fabric. 
  
  ‚ÄúJust through here, miss.‚Äù He said, ushering me into a drawing room done up in the cream, charcoal and amethyst colours of varnish clams. 

  ‚ÄúWow‚Ä¶‚Äù I whispered, gripping the strap of my satchel to my chest. 
  If my boots had not been full of dirt maybe my feet wouldn't chafe in the heels they gave me. But they did and I had to hobble over to the group of elegant ladies seated for tea and sandwiches at the grand round table in the attached dining room. 

  ‚ÄúKayara!‚Äù said a familiar voice. Ehlia stood, her avocado and golden, satin gown was in stark contrast to the room. Her presence though, well she made a lot more sense now. 

  ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶‚Äù I had run into her a handful of times now, at the library, at a coffee shop across the road, and even in a garden once.  ‚ÄúNever thought to mention you live in the palace?‚Äù I had figured she did but it was strange she hadn't said it.

  Her heels clicked on the beige marble floor as she approached. ‚ÄúYou didn't know who I was and I wasn't entirely sure who you were‚Ä¶ Until I saw a newspaper from Filcephette.‚Äù
  I had not exactly told her who I was either and her face said as much. 
  ‚ÄúCome, sit and speak before the princes arrive.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúPrinces?‚Äù 

  ‚ÄúOh, Highness, Meet Kayara of Faihrenreich‚Äì Kayara, this is the Princess Anataya of Caephaern and the Coorephein Forest.‚Äù
  Was the world spinning faster? Oh how I hated royalty!
  ‚ÄúAna.‚Äù I muttered, piecing it together. 
  
  ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù said the one wearing the biggest tiara. There were two, the smaller was on a redheaded teenager. Likely the Princesses little half sister, Princess Lilith. 

  ‚ÄúHighnesses, it is an honour to make your acquaintances, as it is to meet your HandMaidens.‚Äù I said dipping into the professional curtsy that Ptula had drilled into me like a mad warmonger. 

  ‚ÄúOh, I see it now.‚Äù Said the brooding looking one on Anatayas left. Her sister was on her right, and next to Lilith is where Ehlia returned to her seat.
  There was a couple of empty chairs and I chose the one beside Ehlia, leaving the fifth strange lady flanked by empty chairs. 

  ‚ÄúThe reason I asked you here,‚Äù Anataya, Ana, said getting quickly to business ‚ÄúIs because I do believe you know how to find things that others simply do not have the brains to find.‚Äù 
 
  The ladies all shifted, all except Lilith who was stroking a fluffy grey chinchilla perched on her shoulder and reading a modern philosophy tome. 

  I drew my gaze back to Anataya. ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶‚Äù

  ‚ÄúI read Carhembaels thesis paper. You truly are incredible Kayara.‚Äù Her words made me choke on nothing but air.
  I quickly helped myself to tea, making sure to hold my draping sleeve out of the way as I poured into the empty teacup before me.
  
  ‚ÄúAs glad as I am to be recognized for what was stolen from me‚Ä¶ I don't think I understand what you want from me.‚Äù

  The lonely Handmaiden piped up ‚ÄúWait Charmer didn't write that? I- I thought he‚Ä¶‚Äù She was silenced by a glare from Lilith. 
  The hierarchy in the room was outstandingly clear. 

  ‚ÄúKayara, that is Lady Everen. She hails from a little more south than all but you. This is Lady Neredeah- and of course, you know Ehlia. You seem to have noted Liliths presence‚Ä¶‚Äù

  I paused and then said ‚ÄúYes. That book you are reading highness- I have yet to see it on any shelf but I recognize the author from somewhere‚Ä¶‚Äù 
  
  She smiled and turned the book around to show me the author's photo on the inseam of the dust jacket.
  ‚ÄúShe wrote The nuance of new empires, in the shadow of fallen ones.‚Äù The young princess smirked. ‚ÄúThis one has yet to be publicly published.‚Äù

  I hated royals.
  But the comment made me smile nonetheless.

  ‚ÄúA long title indeed.‚Äù Neredeah muttered before sipping her tea, daintily. 

  ‚ÄúA bold statement to make from the top of the empire she spoke of within the book.‚Äù Anataya sniped. ‚ÄúAnyways, we likely don't have a lot of time before the boys arrive and ruin our peace‚Ä¶ I just wanted to make sure you would consider the offer.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúWhich I‚Äôm still uncertain the details of?‚Äù I shrugged.

  ‚ÄúYou have been raised by a Lady of extraordinary influence within the twin city to mine. You were raised alongside my fiance-‚Äù Oh Gods No! ‚ÄúAnd you are so well read that a prince thought to steal your work‚Ä¶ You are smart. I need that in my court‚Ä¶ I need that in a Handmaiden.‚Äù 

  ‚ÄúWait what?!‚Äù My shoulders pressed hard into the plush chair back as if the chair was attached to a wyvern and we were diving, plummeting out of the sky!  ‚ÄúNo- I mean, I can't- Fiance? That doesn't matter, surely not Charmer! He's a dickhead- I mean- fu- ‚Ä¶dge‚Ä¶‚Äù 

  My spew of thoughts caused giggles to be hidden behind teacups and a distinctly male snort sounded from behind me. Fuck the gods, and fuck the bastard behind me.

  ‚ÄúHello to you too Yara.‚Äù 

  ‚ÄúFuck you!‚Äù I smashed the teacup on the table, gasps and a cry from my left erupted but I didn't care. I swung my body out of the chair in a whirlwind of pink skirts and charged at Charmer. 
  
  Another familiar face appeared in front of me, his skinny arms and body taking me back a step. ‚ÄúCaso.‚Äù I grit out trying to get past him. He was a few inches taller and had definitely put on some wait in the year since I had been gone. 

  ‚ÄúCasonophe let me go! Let me at least fix that goddamn wreckage of a genetic embarrassment to your mothers otherwise handsome lineage!‚Äù 

  ‚ÄúHoly Heavens above‚Ä¶‚Äù Someone said from behind me and I threw the broken teacup on the floor just as guards rushed in with raised pistols.

  ‚ÄúHighnesses?‚Äù They asked. There were guards dressed in lapis lazuli uniforms, and guards in dark teal. For the two Princes of Filciphette, the southern sister. 
  
  ‚ÄúEverything is ok, she's basically our sister. She wouldn't permanently main us but‚Ä¶‚Äù Caso looked at his brother, ‚ÄúCharmer just sit in a corner or something.‚Äù 

  ‚ÄúShe. Attacked. Me.‚Äù The bitch boy snapped back, but then he saw over my shoulder and remembered just as I did, that there were others. 

  Charmer hadn't changed a bit. 
  His hair was longer, down to his shoulders now, and he had shaved that mustache that always had crumbs in it. But he had not changed. 
  He stood like he would sell his firstborn for a cool sword. 
  His crooked, insidious, smirk said he'd fuck a pig for free. 
  ‚ÄúShaved the mustache but there's still crumbs on your face heh?‚Äù 
  Even his strides to the empty chair between Neredeah and Evyrn were laced with an air of such willfully ignorant arrogance that I wanted to puke. 

  ‚ÄúI don't see any crumbs.‚Äù Ehlia piped up. 

  ‚ÄúNo?‚Äù I said with mock shock ‚ÄúNot from the shit he just spewed out his piehole?‚Äù 

  ‚ÄúWhat the fuck Yara?‚Äù Caso sighed from beside me. 
  A maid rushed in suddenly and I stepped out of her way, a nagging guilty feeling in my chest. 
   I then turned and hissed at the prince who had practically raised me. ‚ÄúIf he had ruined your future what would you do?‚Äù 

  ‚ÄúI would kick his ass. But I wouldn't do it in front of two princesses and three prominent ladies.‚Äù He replied.

  ‚ÄúOr your new boss.‚Äù Anataya chuckled, raising her teacup to me. Saluting me.

  ‚ÄúWhat, are you going to be the princess‚Äô personal nerd?‚Äù Charming snorted.

  I rushed to say ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù But the Princess was hot on my case with ‚ÄúAs a matter of fact, she is Taking Liliths place as my fourth Handmaiden while the princess visits her mother for a few months. You know, trial era and all‚Ä¶ And if we fit she will be my fifth.‚Äù

  There was an echoed gasp. ‚ÄúThat-‚Äù Ehlia stuttered and Everen cut in ‚ÄúIt is tradition to only gave four, Princess Ana.‚Äù 

  ‚ÄúOh don't be such a sailor, no superstitions under my roof. Do you hear?‚Äù Ana Declared, ‚ÄúNeredeah, please find another seat, I wish to sit with my Affianced.‚Äù 

  ‚ÄúYes, Highness.‚Äù The broody one said, moving wearily to the seat next to me. 
  The servant had cleared the glass and then made herself sparse, but the Lady still covered the chair cushion with a napkin before sitting. 
  I made myself comfortable and made certain to adjust my seat a little closer to her. 
  
  ‚ÄúKynden and Deacle? How are they?‚Äù I addressed him, charmer, plucking a salmon and soft cheese sandwich off the serving platter in the middle of the table. 

  ‚ÄúThey're here too. They usually join us but I believe there was a show they wanted to catch.‚Äù

  I chuckled, ‚ÄúAna, I do believe that means they've been drunk since yesterday morning and found new beds last night.‚Äù

Really? America sucks?

Go ahead. Book a flight to a village in Haiti where people live on $5 a day, if they‚Äôre lucky. Where dinner is sometimes nothing, because the crops failed and the aid truck never showed up. Where kids eat mud cookies to trick their stomachs into thinking they‚Äôre full.

Try waking up in a shack made of rusted tin and old election posters. No running water. No fridge. No toilet. Just a hole in the ground and a bucket you hope won‚Äôt get stolen.

Medical care? Good luck. The nearest clinic is 40 miles away, and the doctor‚Äôs only there on Tuesdays. No anesthesia. No antibiotics. Just prayers.

School? If you‚Äôre not out working by age 8, congratulations. You‚Äôre the educated one in the village.

You complain about minimum wage in the U.S.? People in parts of Africa, South Asia, and Central America are working 12-hour shifts breaking rocks or sorting garbage to earn $3. That‚Äôs if they don‚Äôt get cholera from the water first.

Reddit says America is a dystopia because housing is expensive. True. But people elsewhere are literally sleeping on dirt, in huts that wash away during monsoon season.

You cry about your healthcare plan while others give birth on concrete floors with no nurse in sight and hope they or the baby survive.

You hate America? Cool. Go live in a place where malnutrition is so common that kids never grow to full height. Where power comes once a week, if at all. Where ‚Äúonline therapy‚Äù is just shouting into the forest.

America isn‚Äôt perfect. It has a lot to fix. But if this is ‚Äúhell,‚Äù maybe take a trip to where life isn‚Äôt about thriving or complaining, it‚Äôs just about surviving.",0,1749045001.0,rant,5,0.31,False

Captain Ephraim Espinoza looked at Lt. Yeela Chen as he stepped onto the bridge. Yeela looked tired. Worn out.  
""May the One who existed before time started, be with you, captain.""  
He walked straight to the coffee machine.  
""Status!"" he demanded. ""Bad news first.""

""1. We had another puncture in the forward safety shields. Microscopical, no need to worry. 2. As you know, our ion-thrusters have few if any moving parts, but the ball bearings of its steering mechanism at thruster 4 have considerable long-term wear. Do you want to have the ball-bearings replaced?""

He shook his head. After over six hundred years of interstellar flight many systems showed defects or malfunctions. Even though the ship had been designed for a lifespan of 800 earth years.  
Lt.Mireille continued:  
""3. The thorium stocks for thruster 4 are running low. We may have to transfer some thorium from the other reactors.""  
""We may need the reserve ball bearings for something more urgent. Any more bad news? Keep an eye at the thorium levels. Initiate the procedure when required.""  
""And, on the positive side, we do have really fantastic news: Two of the crew of the ship before us went outside for some repairs. We have sound recordings from the communication between the crew members and the ship. And we have taken some pics of the crew members in their space suits. The photos are not very clear due to the distance, but here they are.""  
""Amazing!"" the captain exclaimed. ""Frog-like beings!""  
The three listened to the sounds the frogs made.  
""It must be an example of parallel evolution,"" Yeela remarked. ""Even their voices sound like some earth frogs in our data banks.""  
""They have 6 legs,"" Yeela pointed out. ""It means they are truly alien. It's not that some aliens took frogs from Earth and let them hatch on another planet.""  
""Do they know we're behind them?"" the captain asked.  
""We have no indication. If not, that's not very careful of them. But in a couple of hours we'll overtake them, and then they probably will. Their navigator, or helmsman, or whatever you want to call him, made another course correction three hours ago. It reduced their speed again. If they make one more speed reduction, they'll plummet into the sun, by our calculation.""  
""Would they be in trouble?"" the captain wondered.  
""I don't know, sir.""  
""That giant solar sail of theirs catches a lot of solar radiation,"" the captain said. ""It helps them to slow down.""  
""Either they're in trouble or they have a phenomenally good navigator. Our ship needs another swing around the star before we can circle the 2nd planet.""  
Captain Ephraim asked:  
""No signs from Earth, I suppose? No Evolutionists who have overtaken us?""  
""None. The life on the second planet could theoretically be human, but two days ago, we agreed we likely would have recognized their radio and television signals.""  
""Speaking of which, any news about the second planet?""  
""It has no magnetic field.""  
""So no metal core,"" the captain said slowly.  
""Not an iron core, at least. Or no rotating one.""  
""The planet seems to be geologically stable. No signs of volcanic eruptions. Some modestly high mountains encircle a desert-like continent, but mostly average-sized, low hilly continents dotted all over the planet. No signs of major recent tectonic plate movement. Our images are not good enough yet to distinguish individuals. Maybe in a few months.""  
""Let's try to contact these frogs.""

\-----

""This is technician Fast Feet of the Desert Continent Packs calling intruder ships. Identify yourself.""  
Fast Feet was clearly nervous with coordinator Snout behind him in the big room. His voice was steady, but his paws colored red. Snout was clearly stressed and agitated. He didn't want to be attacked from behind. Chances were normally small, but everybody was hungry these days. Legally, it was forbidden to kill other Komodo dragons, but as a pack leader, few would dare to accuse her.

He kept repeating the same message. No reply came.  
""What may be wrong?"" Snout asked.  
""Lots,"" Fast Feet replied. ""They may use fixed frequencies different from ours. They may use different coding systems. They may be so far ahead of our technology that they no longer use radio and TV technology.""  
""Or they regard us as so inferior that they see our attempts at communication as an insult. Or they have come to wipe us out.""  
She thought for a while.  
""Keep trying. Try your ideas for different frequencies and different coding systems. If you need assistance from technicians among the other packs, let me know their names. I'll see what I can arrange.""

A science officer told:  
""The two ships have changed their relative positions. As you know, they are both torus-shaped. Both toruses are rotating. The smaller of the two vessels was in front, but now the big one is in front and shielding the smaller one.""  
""Interesting,"" she said.

She walked out of the room, thinking about the possibility that the ships had come to erase their race from existence.  
If they had come to eradicate them, it was logical that they had brought the big one up in front, she thought. Yes, she'd do well to prepare for the worst.  
And attack was always the best defense. She turned around to the male following her:  
""Contact the Southern Packs. We need lots of their trees to prepare rocket fuel. Better, let them convert it to fuel. And ask the Mountain Packs to deliver the bamboo to build rocket hulls.""  
""What shall we pay them in return?""  
""They have to deliver them for free. These intruders constitute a threat to the very existence of us dragons.""

\-----

Ffffrg looked at the massive ship that had overtaken them. It had three times their size in all three dimensions. 27 Times their volume.  
""A.I., scan all frequencies to see if there are any frequencies on which they attempt to contact us.""  
The reply came immediately.  
""3 Frequencies detected.""  
""Any patterns?""  
""Same signals at all three.""  
CnnC joined him. He explained to her what he was doing. From the color pattern on her skin he saw that she understood him.  
""Let's hear them.""  
It clearly was not an automated signal. The general sounds were identical, but there were small variations audible.  
""It is a frog that was speaking.""  
""Not necessarily a frog,"" CnnC corrected him. ""It's an intelligent being like us, and they do communicate with sounds.""  
CnnC started to apply the same techniques she had used in communication with the planet.  
""We'll assume that it contains sentences like 'Hello, space ship, who are you', 'Please identify yourself', 'This is Bearer of eggs', and so on.""  
""A.I., hail them with 'Unknown vessel, this is Bearer of eggs'. Please state your intentions.' Send it at all three frequencies they use. Use directed radio waves so that the 2nd planet does not hear us.""

\-----

Three days later, the crews of both ships had worked out a basic understanding of each others technology and language. The central AI on the 'Space Ark' had helped the crew enormously. So had the decentralized AI's aboard the 'Bearer of eggs', though very different in internal design. Once the initial hurdle had been taken, they progressed at a rapid pace.

""Captain Ephraim of 'Space Ark',"" he identified himself, taking over from technician DeGoede. The screen showed three frog like beings with green skins, though they occasionally showed other colours.  
""Captain Ffffrg of 'Bearer of Eggs' here. Who are you?""  
""We call ourselves humans. We have come to start a colony in this system. Behind me are Lieutenants Yeela and Mireille.""  
""We call ourselves Frgs. Besides me are Kkwwkk, CnnC, and Fggggg. We have come to lay our eggs in this system.""  
""When you have laid your eggs here, will you leave or will you stay with your eggs?""  
""Of course we will stay with our eggs! Do you leave your eggs?""  
Even though he could not detect indignation, he had the idea he had offended them.  
""I did not intend to offend you. I assume that your intentions are the same as ours: we have come to live in this system. Do you know the inhabitants of the 2nd planet?""  
""No, it came as a surprise to us that there is intelligent life on the 2nd planet. We knew there was plant life when we set out, but we only detected the rulers of the planet when we were woken from our sleep. And you?""  
""The intelligent life is a surprise for us as well. We have not slept as you call it, we are a generation ship and several generations have passed since our ancestors left our home planet. You are the first intelligent creatures from another planet that we have met.""  
""So are you to us. On which planet of this system do you intend to settle?"" Ffffrg asked.  
Captain Ephraim answered:  
""The first planet is way too hot for us. And the third planet is cold, likely too cold. We can‚Äôt live on the gas planet.""  
""We could survive on the third planet in our space suits for a while, but our eggs would never hatch. And our space suits might wear out before we can make new ones."" The colors on the skin of Ffffrg changed subtly as he said this.  
""So you are bound for the 2nd planet?""  
""That's right. Its inhabitants seem to try to contact us, but we have been unable to decipher their signals.""""Same here. We have made some progress with decoding them, and if you are interested, Lt. Mireille can swap our findings with yours.""  
Ephraim continued:  
""Your trajectory surprised us. Are you in trouble? Or are you confident that you can get into orbit around the 2nd planet safely?""  
""I am confident we can manage that. And I have some questions: If we both intend to settle on the second planet, do we work together? Do you want to attack their planet? Conquer it? Threaten them?""  
""We have not brought weapons, though we could alter some of our instruments into weapons. If we are not welcome, we will have to discuss what our alternatives are.""  
""I can agree with that.""  
They disconnected.  
Ephraim turned around:  
""That sounded like a positive guy. Did anyone observe an indication of treachery?""  
""None,"" Lt. Mireille replied. ""I doubt they even have developed that concept.""  
""Or they are so good at it that they outsmarted us completely,"" Lt. Yeela said. ""But maybe the AI's still have trouble conveying emotions.""

\-----

In the next weeks, the two crews together worked out the signals from the planet. They also improved the ship-to-ship communication. The humans learned that the Frgs did not convey emotion through their voices, but through the colors and patterns of their skin.

The two captains watched as the two groups of technicians decoded first the radio signals and later the television. Captain Ephraim watched as the four frogs froze completely as the images of terrifying dragons fighting for the flesh of deceased dragons appeared on the screens. He couldn't suppress a shudder himself. These were creatures emerging directly out of the darkest corners of his subconsciousness. He realized he might have nightmares the coming night. And these were mere images, not live animals.

They discussed the question who would contact the dragons. Both captains volunteered. Ffffrg was recognized as the most amiable person. As they wanted permission from the dragons, amiability was a big factor. The frgs also were technically slightly ahead of the humans. Ephraim was worried that Ffffrg might be too soft-hearted, to open, and might not be sharp enough of treachery, a concept he had to explain in depth. Ephraim rejected Ffffrg suggestion to do the session together: ""It would be very awkward if the two of us would get into a fierce debate in front of them.""

In the end they selected CnnC. She understood the concept of treachery better than Kkwwkk. Assuming the dragon society had a form of organization, they would probably understand the idea of delegation. CnnC had the possibility to postpone the meeting if there was not someone of equal authority on the other end.

Captain Ephraim and the crew on the bridge of the Space Ark watched as CnnC contacted the 2nd planet.

""Coordinator Deadly Venom of the Desert Continent Packs speaking."" He looked like a Komodo Dragon with six paws. Her skin was brown. Behind her was a wall with screens, which looked like they were made of bamboo. Two other dragons walked around. The dragons were indoors. CnnC had left the camera aboard the Bearer of Eggs switched off.

Frrrg nodded to CnnC. She had frozen for a few moments when the dragon had roared, but recovered quickly.  
""CnnC of the Bearer of Eggs speaking. How nice to finally speak with you. I would like to speak with the leader of your Packs.""  
""Pack Leader Snout is not present. Why would she bother to come and speak with you?""  
""You have tried to contact us. About what?""  
The dragon looked at a sheet of paper on his desk.  
""You are intruders. This system is ours. These are our hunting grounds. Get out.""  
""If this is your message, why did your leader try to contact us?""  
Fast Feet noticed someone handed him a sheet of paper.  
""We now have orders to chase you out of our hunting grounds. Besides, your camera isn't working.""  
""That's something we can remedy,"" CnnC replied. She activated her implant to contact the ships-AI: 'activate my camera and transmit video.'  
She saw how Deadly Venom looked in amazement at her screen. It took the dragon 5 full seconds before she said:  
""You are PREY!""

[https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/04/trump-officials-farm-product-trade-deficit-forecast-00382549](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/04/trump-officials-farm-product-trade-deficit-forecast-00382549)

Trump administration officials delayed and redacted a government forecast because it predicts an increase in the nation‚Äôs trade deficit in farm goods later this year, according to two people familiar with the matter.

The numbers run counter to President Donald Trump‚Äôs messaging that his economic policies, including tariffs, will reduce U.S. trade imbalances. The politically inconvenient data prompted administration officials to block publication of the written analysis¬†[normally attached to the report because they disliked what it said about the deficit.](https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/search?reports%5B0%5D=report_type%3A10257)

The published report,¬†[released Monday but dated May 29](https://ers.usda.gov/sites/default/files/_laserfiche/outlooks/112707/AES-132.pdf?v=54213), includes numbers that are unchanged from how they would‚Äôve read in the unredacted report, said the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss internal decision-making.

Policymakers, farm groups and commodities traders rely on the closely watched report, which the Agriculture Department issues quarterly, for its analysis of imports and exports of major farm commodities including cotton and livestock. The highly unusual rollout could raise questions about potential political meddling with government reports that have traditionally been trusted for decades.

‚ÄúObjectivity is really key here and the public depends on it,‚Äù said Joe Glauber, a former USDA chief economist. ‚ÄúTo lose that trust would be terrible.‚Äù

A USDA spokesperson blamed the delay on an internal review.

‚ÄúThe report was hung up in internal clearance process and was not finalized in time for its typical deadline,‚Äù said USDA spokesperson Alec Varsamis in a statement. ‚ÄúGiven this report is not statutory as with many other reports USDA does, the Department is undergoing a review of all of its non-statutory reports, including this one, to determine next steps.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not clear when or if the written analysis portion will be released.

[The previous forecast, published in February](https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/6m311p28w/s75288160/707975259/AES-131.pdf), projected a deficit of $49 billion for the current fiscal year, an increase from the November 2024 report. The new analysis revises the projection to a record $49.5 billion, beating the previous record of $31.8 billion in fiscal 2024.

Republicans used the quarterly report‚Äôs rising trade deficit projections during the Biden administration to accuse then-Secretary Tom Vilsack of¬†not doing enough to promote U.S. farm exports.¬†Agriculture secretaries historically have used the forecasts to promote policy initiatives.

The May report reflects Trump‚Äôs on-again, off-again tariffs, the people said. The president has announced sharply higher tariffs on China and ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù levies of at least 10 percent on most U.S. trading partners.

Tariffs are not the only contributing factor to any trade deficit or surplus, Glauber said. Americans‚Äô love for blueberries year-round, loyalty to French wines and addiction to goods like coffees ‚Äî which the U.S. largely does not produce ‚Äî also contribute.¬†A strong dollar can also widen the deficit.

‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre importing is largely not what we‚Äôre exporting,‚Äù he said, noting that prices for common U.S. agricultural imports, such as wine and liquor, are not as volatile as the nation‚Äôs agricultural exports like soybeans.

Two federal courts last week halted and then allowed the reciprocal tariffs to proceed, a back-and-forth that¬†[only added to the uncertainty for farmers and businesses](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/29/federal-judge-temporarily-reinstates-trumps-tariffs-on-dozens-of-countries-00375001).¬†[Farmers are facing a more difficult economic outlook](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/04/farmers-tariffs-trump-trade-war-00271146)¬†than they did during Trump‚Äôs first term: Some foreign markets have permanently shrunk and higher inflation has crimped farmers‚Äô bottom lines.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has strongly defended Trump‚Äôs tariffs, arguing that imposing them is essential to removing barriers to U.S. exports, including non-tariff barriers.

She is¬†[leading a trade delegation to Italy this week,](https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/05/30/secretary-rollins-leads-trade-delegation-italy-continues-aggressive-travel-agenda-promote-american)¬†and has several more trips planned later this year to promote American agricultural commodities.

My toddler (20 month old boy) is, for the most part, a super content, independent lil guy. He has an expressive speech delay, but seems to understand most everything (within reason). He‚Äôs very active and loves running around the backyard, climbing, and reading books. Typical toddler things.

Where I‚Äôm a little concerned is here: he has an intense obsession with cars. He can play for longer than a lot of toddlers his age that I‚Äôve seen. He likes to line up his cars along our coffee table, but isn‚Äôt pretending with them. Just likes to push them and line them up in various ways. Any car we see, he gets VERY excited and will point and grunt until we acknowledge we see the car too. (Parking lots are fun lol)
He also doesn‚Äôt seem interested at all in mimicking or interacting with my husband and me, unless we‚Äôre picking him up and doing super fun, PHYSICAL things like flipping him upside down, or flying him around the room.
He doesn‚Äôt really smile at people unless they‚Äôre doing something silly and he knows them very well.
He has an intense fear of strangers‚Ä¶ to the point that they can‚Äôt even talk to him without him crying most of the time‚Ä¶ BUT he does seem interested in them if they don‚Äôt come too close or try to touch or talk to him. He‚Äôs ESPECIALLY interested in older kids and babies.
He throws tantrums like any toddler. They‚Äôre intense, but he‚Äôs also over them VERY quickly too.
Lately, he‚Äôs become REALLY picky with food as well. Textures, new food, etc.
He doesn‚Äôt really do a whole lot of stimming that I‚Äôve noticed. But he does do a lot of random yelling using ‚Äúah‚Äù and ‚Äúeee‚Äù sounds for no other reason than he feels like it.

All that to say, whether he is or he isn‚Äôt on the spectrum, I really just want to know so I can help him in whatever way that he needs. A lot of people say it‚Äôs too young to tell, but I want to know as early as possible.
Wondered if anyone has had similar experiences with their kiddos and if they did receive an autism diagnosis or didn‚Äôt. Also curious what steps you had to go through to get the diagnosis.
TIA!

Welp, it was. She said that it was a weird infection because there was ‚Äúno pus but a lot of granulated tissue that was eating the bone‚Äù.
They cut up the whole outer gum with the bump, removed the implant, and gave me some more clindamycin and said we‚Äôd see how the bone was healing. My two week check up is next week. 

It‚Äôs still a little swollen and uncomfortable. I‚Äôve been very paranoid, no hot coffee, no exercise, etc. she said she was shocked because my bone graft in the fall went perfect but this is not.


Idk what to do. If we try and it fails again , then what? I do not want a bridge :(

Guest List is definitely my kind of thing, not sure why I hadn‚Äôt worn it yet. It‚Äôs much prettier on than both my swatch stick and in the bottle.  Rush Hour is my Most Improved! Looking at the bottle I was thinking ‚Äúwhy did I buy this again?‚Äù But I love it!  

I was pretty ‚Äúmeh‚Äù on both Paige and Paisley as I was painting them but they‚Äôre already growing on me!  If I had to choose I guess I like the holo in Paige slightly more, but the flakies in Paisley are really nice! 

I actually still have no idea why I bought Misbehaving hahaha.  I‚Äôm not usually much of a bright pinks person. I have to assume I got it for my daughter who used to love pink. But kids being fickle pink is Very Much OUT lately ü§£

One of our users is going to work from home so we added them to our fortigate just like we have all the other users. Added the account to the fortigate via LDAP, added them to our SSL Vpn group, assigned a fortimobile token and setup the fortitoken app on their phone. Just as we have done a hundred times.

User tries it out and says it won't connect. Says it takes the username and password but then flashes, the boxes are empty and a status window says the VPN is down. She tries a couple more times, eventually it asks for the token but same thing, flashes and says VPN is down. I feel like there is a bit of user error here, wrong password on the first few tries, that kind of thing.

She tries again later and says it worked but she was testing at a coffee shop. Went home and it won't connect again. I again assume some user error here.

My normal testing at this point is to try her login in my forticlient. I also try my login on her forticlient, trying to narrow down if the issue is the user, the forticlient install, the laptop itself. Nothing really helps because sometimes her login works on my laptop, sometimes it does not. Sometimes my login works on her laptop, sometimes it does not. This sporadic behavior is running me around in circles.

So today I'm at my home office where I connect to this VPN all the time. I put her creds into my forticlient and it won't connect. The error in the forticlient is Permission denied -455. So I removed her from the Fortigate, added her again, added her to the group she needs to be in, but do not enable 2fa. Test it and it connects. Great, progress.

Call the user, tell her to test it. It does not connect. She gets Token denied or timeout 7105. I try it again on my end, it fails and I get permission denied -455 again.

Hoping somebody can help me reset here and figure this out because I'm just going around in circles.

Thanks

Cue malicious compliance!

So, when we got the coffee, I looked in the bag and I was said, ‚ÄúDad your Splenda is not in the bag.‚Äù My dad started to get a little a bit upset. I suddenly got look of realization on my face.  I turned to him and I asked him, ‚ÄúUh, dad? You don‚Äôt think they put all of the packets in your coffee do you?‚Äù 

The moment he took a sip, he nearly spat it out. Turns out they didn‚Äôt realize he was joking. They thought he was serious. He ended up throwing the cup of coffee away when we got to whatever store we ended up going to after getting whatever he ended up getting at McDonald‚Äôs. 

My dad was completely joking. My dad is someone who likes to tease, but I feel like he wanted the amount of Splenda so that he could have extra packets, but he did not think that they would actually put that much in there. They didn‚Äôt ask if he was sure. 

They maliciously complied with his request, not even questioning anything which honestly quite hilarious on their part. 

I find this absolutely hilarious. What my dad should‚Äôve said was put the Splenda on the side. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I told my dad that that‚Äôs what he gets for trying to be funny. And I was telling him that‚Äôs what he gets for not being specific, especially in a drive-through. And for teasing. But yeah, the coffee for him was 100% undrinkable imagine having that much in like what a 12 ounce not 100% but I can‚Äôt remember all the details. I just know that my dad learned his lesson.

üïì **Start around 4 PM | Explore Wangping Street**

To avoid the daytime heat (from June to early Oct), it‚Äôs best to head out around 4 PM.

Wangping Street is a cozy, artsy neighborhood with lots of cute caf√©s, vintage shops, and chill spots to wander. Around 5 PM, a little evening market opens nearby, with stalls selling snacks, clothes, accessories, and quirky handmade stuff.

You‚Äôll also see locals playing mahjong and poker on the streets ‚Äî a real slice of Chengdu life.

üçΩÔ∏è **Dinner or Drinks by the River**

This area has a good mix of food and drink options. If you‚Äôre not hungry yet, grab a coffee, milk tea, or even a ¬•9.9 beer at one of the riverside caf√©s.

Pick a spot with outdoor seating and enjoy the breeze while chatting with friends. Or try some classic Sichuan snacks if you‚Äôre ready for dinner.

üåâ **Walk to Dongmen Wharf (or Take a Boat Ride)**

After chilling at Wangping Street, take a slow 10‚Äì15 minute walk along the river toward Dongmen Wharf.

You can hop on a short boat ride down Jinjiang River for peaceful sunset views, or just enjoy a relaxed riverside walk. The city lights gradually turn on and the view gets prettier as it gets darker.

üé∂ **End with Live Music or River Vibes**

Nearby Jiuyan Bridge is known for its nightlife and live music bars. If you‚Äôre in the mood, step into a bar with live performances.

Starbucks has always been my go-to place to relax, read, get some work done, and enjoy a good cup of coffee. I‚Äôd almost call myself a ""loyal"" customer. I said ""almost"" because I also regularly go to Bo's Coffee.

But today was the first time I left Starbucks disappointed.

I ordered a Grande Caf√© Americano and a Cinnamon Danish, planning to stay awhile and read. The queue wasn‚Äôt too long. When it was my turn, the barista asked for my name (as usual) and wrote it on the cup.

When he set the cup down, I saw it read ‚ÄúJade.‚Äù I corrected him, saying it should be ‚ÄúJP.‚Äù No apology, he crumpled the cup and grabbed a new one. I even spelled out the initials: It's JP, J for Juliet and P for Papa, JP.

After that, I handed over a ‚Ç±1,000 bill for the payment. He asked if I had a smaller bill. I didn‚Äôt, but I offered to get the change later since I‚Äôd be staying there anyway. He ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù my receipt (perhaps as a reminder) but ended up giving me the change right then. And yet, he still kept the receipt with him.

I waited for my order. A few minutes passed, and I heard a barista call out in an unpleasant tone: ‚ÄúCaf√© Americano for JC!‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt react. It wasn‚Äôt my name. I assumed someone else had a similar order. But after several more minutes and the addition of a Cinnamon Danish to the tray, I started to wonder. Still, ‚ÄúJC‚Äù was being called, repeatedly and coldly, with no one stepping up.

That‚Äôs when I realized: they meant me.

Frustrated and disappointed, I decided to walk out without claiming my order. It‚Äôs been about 30 minutes now. I imagine they‚Äôre still calling out ‚ÄúJC‚Äù for an order that‚Äôs probably headed to the garbage can soon.

Sorry, #Starbucks. Today, you lost a customer.

Either a god tier workout or a full body freak out. Depends on the day. If you‚Äôve ever dry scooped a pre and then questioned your life choices 15 minutes later, you‚Äôre not alone. Understanding pre workout ingredients and their side effects is crucial before choosing any pre workout supplements. Let‚Äôs break down the good, the bad, and the genuinely unhinged side of pre workouts.

The first time I tried pre workout was about a year ago an experiment because all my gym bros were on it and swore by the stuff.

**Fact**: it did give me a mental boost and a serious jolt of energy.

**Fun fact:** it also made me feel like I was being electrocuted from the inside. The tingling was so intense I jumped into the shower mid workout, hoping water would somehow fix my beta-alanine meltdown (*spoiler: it didn‚Äôt*). My heart was racing like it wanted out, I was sweating bullets, and sprinting around the hall like a golden retriever on Red Bull. Full zoomies mode. I‚Äôll admit I might have a dash of undiagnosed ADHD, which probably didn‚Äôt help.

# Pre Workout Ingredients: Complete Breakdown

So what exactly turns a scoop of pre workout into the gym version of rocket fuel? What makes it pre workout and not just glorified flavored caffeine? Unlike whatever cocktail of toxicity and narcissism turned your girlfriend into your ex, there‚Äôs a specific brew behind the buzz. Let‚Äôs break down the not so secret ingredients that give pre workouts their magic what‚Äôs actually in that scoop, what each compound does, how much you *should* be taking, and why some blends feel like dark wizardry in disguise. Time to dissect the potion.

|**Ingredient**|**What It Does**|**Optimal Dose**|**Side Effects (Overdose/Sensitive)**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Caffeine**|Increases alertness, focus, endurance, and reduces perceived exertion|3‚Äì6 mg/kg body weight (150‚Äì300 mg)|Jitters, anxiety, insomnia, elevated heart rate, dependency|
|**Beta-Alanine**|Buffers lactic acid ‚Üí delaying muscle fatigue|3.2‚Äì6.4 g/day|Tingling (paraesthesia), flushing, mild skin irritation|
|[**Creatine Monohydrate**](https://turbulencegains.com/creatine-monohydrate/)|Boosts ATP regeneration‚Üí improves strength and power output|3‚Äì5 g/day|Water retention, bloating (rare), mild GI discomfort|
|**L-Citrulline Malate**|Increases nitric oxide ‚Üí better pumps, blood flow, endurance|6‚Äì8 g (1:2 ratio with malate)|GI upset, flatulence if overdosed|
|**L-Arginine**|Older pump ingredient, less bioavailable than citrulline|6‚Äì10 g|Poor absorption, possible GI issues|
|**L-Tyrosine**|Enhances cognitive performance under stress|500‚Äì2,000 mg|Headache, nausea (high doses)|
|**Taurine**|Supports hydration, reduces cramps, boosts endurance|1‚Äì2 g|Rare, but can cause hypotension or sedation in sensitive users|
|**Theanine**|Calms without sedation; balances caffeine's intensity|100‚Äì200 mg (1:1 ratio with caffeine)|Minimal occasionally drowsiness in high doses|
|**Theacrine**|Caffeine like stimulant, longer lasting, less tolerance build up|100‚Äì300 mg|Similar to caffeine, but less potent anxiety, irritability|
|**Yohimbine**|Fat loss aid, stimulant, boosts adrenaline and blood flow|0.2 mg/kg (max \~15 mg/day)|High blood pressure, anxiety and panic attacks. Also banned in some countries|
|**Synephrine (Bitter Orange)**|Stimulant, used for fat loss and energy|10‚Äì20 mg|Heart palpitations, dizziness, banned in several countries|
|**Glycerol (Hydromax/Mono)**|Hyper hydrating ‚Üí better pumps, endurance|1‚Äì3 g (HydroMax); 10‚Äì20 g (mono)|Bloating, diarrhea (especially with insufficient water intake)|
|**B-Vitamins**|Support energy metabolism and neurotransmitters|Varies by type (B6, B12, niacin etc.)|Flushing (niacin), nausea (excess B6), mostly harmless in moderation|
|**Nitrates (Beetroot extract)**|Increase NO production ‚Üí endurance + blood flow|400‚Äì800 mg of nitrates (\~6‚Äì8 mmol)|Beet colored urine, GI upset|
|**Electrolytes (Na, K, Mg)**|Replenish salts lost in sweat, prevent cramping|Varies: 200‚Äì400 mg Na, 100‚Äì200 mg K|Rare, but hypernatremia if taken excessively|

Now let‚Äôs talk about the elephant in the room: proprietary blends. These sneaky little villains are the supplement industry‚Äôs version of ‚Äútrade secrets.‚Äù But instead of guarding some brilliant game changing formula they mostly protect the companies‚Äô ability to throw in whatever they want without telling you how much. Curious about how much caffeine or beta alanine you're actually getting in your pre workout supplements? Tough luck. Instead you get a vague mystery mix with a fancy name like ‚ÄúPerformance Matrix‚Äù or ‚ÄúEnergy Complex‚Äù and you‚Äôre just supposed to trust it‚Äôll do the job.

**Spoiler alert:** more often than not this means underdosed ingredients overpriced scoops and zero transparency. If you‚Äôre paying for gains you deserve to know exactly what you‚Äôre putting into your body not play a guessing game. So next time you spot ‚Äúproprietary blend‚Äù on a label raise an eyebrow and maybe raise a glass of water instead.

# The Good: What Research Says Works

Alright, let‚Äôs kick things off with the good because not all pre workouts supplements are just colorful sugar bombs that make you jitter like you‚Äôve had three espressos and zero chill. When the stars align and the science backs it up, these bad boys can turn you into a gym superhero more energy, sharper focus, and strength gains that make you feel like you might just bench press a small car (or at least a hefty suitcase). So buckle up, because here‚Äôs the legit science on why pre workouts can be your workout‚Äôs best friend.

# 1. Pre Workout Supplements Boost Sprint Endurance and Energy System Efficiency

Figueiredo, C., Lira, F.S., Rossi, F.E.¬†*et al.*¬†Multi-ingredient pre workout supplementation changes energy system contribution and improves performance during high-intensity intermittent exercise in physically active individuals: a double-blind and placebo controlled study.¬†*J Int Soc Sports Nutr*¬†17, 30 (2020).

[**Read Study**](https://rdcu.be/en02o)

**What they did:**

* **Participants**: 12 recreationally active males
* **Design**: Randomized, double blind, placebo controlled crossover
* **Protocol**: Repeated 15 second maximal treadmill sprints interspersed with 15 second rest until exhaustion
* **Supplement**: MIPS containing caffeine (300 mg), creatine (3.5 g), beta alanine (2 g), citrulline malate (6 g), arginine, tyrosine, taurine, and B vitamins
* **Placebo**: Flavor matched maltodextrin beverage

**Key findings:**

* Time to exhaustion increased by 18% (mean 20 min vs. 17.0 min placebo)
* The number of sprints completed increased by 14% (mean 41 vs 36)
* ATP CP and oxidative energy system contributions were significantly higher (+28% and +24%) in the MIPS condition
* Glycolytic system contribution increased, but not significantly

**Bottom line:**

If your workouts feel like your gas tank empties in five minutes flat, this kind of pre can squeeze out extra laps before the crash. It taps into your body's fast and clean fuel systems. Not magic, but definitely more juice in the engine.

# 2. Pre Workout Increases Focus and Energy Without Strength Gains

Kedia, A.W., Hofheins, J.E., Habowski, S.M., Ferrando, A.A., Gothard, M.D., Lopez, H.L. (2014). Effects of a Pre workout Supplement on Lean Mass, Muscular Performance, Subjective Workout Experience and Biomarkers of Safety. International Journal of Medical Sciences, 11(2), 116-126.

[**Read study**](https://www.medsci.org/v11p0116.htm)

**What they did:**

* **Participants**: 43 resistance trained men and women
* **Design**: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-week training study
* **Supplement**: Pre workout containing creatine monohydrate (3 g), betaine (2.5 g), caffeine (180 mg), and dendrobium extract
* **Placebo**: Calorie free flavored drink with similar amount of caffine

**Key findings:**

* Significant increase in subjective energy and focus reported by participants
* Small but statistically significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (\~3‚Äì5 mm Hg)
* No significant improvements in muscle strength or lean body mass compared to placebo

**Bottom line:**

Felt like a vibe boost, not a power boost. You'll be wired and ready, but don‚Äôt expect your PRs to magically skyrocket just from this. Great for feeling like a gym superhero. Just maybe not lifting like one.

# 3. Cardiovascular Effects of Pre workout

Bella YF, Cupido SRS, Inacio PAQ, Sobral MLP, Vieira RP. Pre Workout Supplements and Their Effects on Cardiovascular Health: An Integrative Review.¬†*J Cardiovasc Dev Dis*. 2025;12(4):112. Published 2025 Mar 24.

[**Read study**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40278171/)

**What they did:**

* **Scope**: Integrative review of 24 studies evaluating cardiovascular responses to MIPS
* **Participants**: Healthy adults and athletes
* **Supplements**: Various MIPS formulations, often with high caffeine doses (>200 mg)

**Key findings:**

* Mixed effects: some studies found reductions in blood pressure and LDL cholesterol
* Others found increases in resting heart rate and blood pressure, especially at high caffeine doses
* Individual responses varied widely depending on caffeine sensitivity and supplement composition

**Bottom line:**

Caffeine hits everyone different. If your pre makes your heart drum louder than your gym playlist, it‚Äôs not ‚Äúworking better‚Äù- it‚Äôs just overdosed for you. Know your limit. Respect your heart.

# The Bad: Pre workout side Effects & Overhyped Promises

But of course, with great power comes great... *crash potential.* Now that we‚Äôve hyped up the good, let‚Äôs slide into the pre workout side effects that doesn‚Äôt get its own flashy marketing video. Because for every tub that gives you laser focus and Hulk strength, there‚Äôs one that leaves you itchy, dizzy, bloated, or wondering if your heart‚Äôs trying to break up with you mid set.

Some ingredients? Under dosed. Others? So over dosed they could probably power a small lawnmower.

# 1. Boosted Energy & Focus, but Side Effects Are Common

Jagim, A. R., Camic, C. L., & Harty, P. S. (2019). Common Habits, Adverse Events, and Opinions Regarding Pre Workout Supplement Use Among Regular Consumers. Nutrients, 11(4), 855.

[**Read Study**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6520716/)

**What they did:**

* Distributed an online survey via social media to adult males and females who reported regular use of multi ingredient pre workout supplements (MIPS). 1,045 responded, with **872 completing** the survey (males: 636;females: 233)

**Key findings:**

**Long term use was common:**

* 72.2% of users had been taking MIPS for over 1 year (630 out of 872 participants)
* MIPS were used frequently throughout the week
* The majority took them 4 or 5 days per week, with 24.1% using them 4 times and 24.3% using them 5 times weekly

The most common reasons for using MIPS (Multi Ingredient Pre Workout Supplements) included:

* Increased energy and mental focus by 89% of participants (776 users)
* Improved muscular endurance reported by 37.3% (325 users)
* Enhanced muscle pumps or better blood flow mentioned by 37.0% (322 users)

**Dosing patterns varied:**

* While most users took a single serving per workout
* 14% took two or more servings at once
* 18% used MIPS more than once per day

Adverse side effects were reported by over half (54%) of users, with common complaints including:

* Skin reactions (e.g. tingling or flushing)
* Heart related symptoms (e.g. palpitations or irregular heartbeat)
* Nausea or digestive discomfort
* Women were more likely to experience side effects, despite typically taking smaller doses than men

**Bottom Line**

Pre workouts are like a boost of energy and focus to get you going in the gym. But watch out lots of people, especially women, get side effects like jitters or upset stomachs. Don‚Äôt go overboard by taking extra scoops or stacking with other caffeine stuff. Play it safe and listen to your body.

# 2. Cardiovascular Safety Risks with Synephrine

de Jonge MLL, Kieviet LC, Sierts M, Egberink LB, van der Heyden MAG. Review of Case Reports on Adverse Events Related to Pre workout Supplements Containing Synephrine.¬†*Cardiovasc Toxicol*. 2023;23(1):1-9.

[**Read Study**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36639595/)

**What they did:**

* Systematically reviewed case reports up to August 2021 from PubMed and Google Scholar, identifying 30 case reports involving 35 patients who experienced medical complaints after using p-synephrine containing supplements.

**Key findings:**

* **Symptoms:** The most frequent presentations included chest pain, palpitations, syncope, and dizziness.
* **Diagnoses:** Commonly ischemic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias, and cerebrovascular events; 5 patients remained disabled or on long term medication at last follow up.
* **Confounders:** Many supplements combined synephrine with caffeine, making it difficult to isolate synephrine‚Äôs exact role.

**Bottom line:**

Synephrine sounds fancy, but it can mess with your heart pretty badly. If you have any heart problems or are sensitive to stimulants, don‚Äôt gamble with this ingredient; it‚Äôs like playing Russian roulette with your chest. Stick to safer fuels unless you want to risk more than just a shaky workout.

# 3. Enhanced Muscular Endurance

Harty, P.S., Zabriskie, H.A., Erickson, J.L.¬†*et al.*¬†Multi ingredient pre workout supplements, safety implications, and performance outcomes: a brief review.¬†*J Int Soc Sports Nutr*¬†15, 41 (2018).

[**Read Study**](https://rdcu.be/en9BS)

**What they did:**

* Reviewed the theoretical rationale and available placebo controlled trials on MIPS blends of caffeine, creatine, Œ≤-alanine, amino acids, and nitric oxide agents, focusing on both acute (single dose) and chronic (‚â•8 weeks) ingestion outcomes.

**Key findings:**

* **Acute effects:** Consistent improvements in muscular endurance and subjective mood during exercise; mixed results for force and power production.
* **Chronic effects:** When combined with a periodized resistance training program, MIPS use led to greater lean mass gains compared to training alone.
* **Safety:** Short term use (<8 weeks) appears safe; long term safety data are lacking. Proprietary blends with undisclosed dosages raise concerns about inadvertent ingestion of banned or contaminated substances.

**Bottom line:**

Multi ingredient pre workouts can help you work out longer, feel better, and even gain some muscle. But most studies only look at short term use, so we don‚Äôt know what happens if you use them for a long time. Also, some products don‚Äôt clearly show what‚Äôs inside, so be careful and pick ones that are honest about their ingredients.

# What These Pre Workout Studies Didn‚Äôt Tell You

Even the most clinical sounding trials can be shakier than your fourth scoop of caffeine. Here‚Äôs where the studies on pre workout supplements fall short for your wallet, your gains, and your sanity.

# Short Term Hype Without Long Game Insight

**Duration check**  
Most trials ran for a single session. You scoop it, lift heavy for an hour, maybe measure a few heartbeats, and that‚Äôs it.

No one is checking in at month three to see if your kidneys are crying or your sleep is wrecked. No year long performance logs. No ""bro, you still alive?"" follow-ups.

**The takeaway**  
These trials test the sprint, not the marathon. Long term effects, tolerance buildup, crashes, or chronic fatigue risks are still in the dark.

# Proprietary Blends Mean Legal Voodoo

Most top sellers list ingredients under proprietary blends. That‚Äôs a fancy way of saying, ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt tell you how much of anything you‚Äôre getting.‚Äù Could be 300 milligrams of caffeine. Could be 50. Could be creatine or just overpriced baking soda.

Some blends even skip clinical doses and sprinkle just enough for label decoration.

**The takeaway**  
Buying pre workouts without disclosed doses is like entering a boxing ring blindfolded. You might feel something, but you won‚Äôt know what hit you.

# No Real World Chaos Allowed

**Lab conditions are too clean**  
Participants eat clean, sleep well, train on schedule. Diet is controlled. No cheat meals. No skipped workouts. Basically a monk‚Äôs life with dumbbells.

**Real life?**  
You‚Äôre running on 4 hours of sleep, missed breakfast, crushed 2 Red Bulls and a samosa, then hit push day. How does your pre workout perform then?

**The takeaway**  
These trials are done in fitness utopia, not real life mess. We need pragmatic studies that reflect chaos, inconsistency, and gym bro reality.

# Limited Outcome Measures

Most studies measured:

* Time to exhaustion
* Number of reps to failure
* Subjective ""how hyped did you feel"" ratings

But almost none tracked real long term strength gains, injury rates, sleep patterns, mood changes, or whether you still love the gym after three months of high stim usage.

**The takeaway**  
Just because you squeezed out two more reps does not mean it is a net win. Real performance is more than what you lift for a day.

# Industry Bias and Conflict of Interest

Some studies were company funded. Some didn‚Äôt even disclose funding. Others came from journals that only publish positive results. Coincidence? Maybe. But where are the trials that say, ‚ÄúHey, this stuff didn‚Äôt work‚Äù?

**The takeaway**  
Publication bias is real. You see the hype, not the flops. Always check who funded the study and if the authors have skin in the supplement game.

# One Dimensional Health Profiles

All participants were young, healthy, and fit. No chronic illness. No medication. Normal BMI. Basically elite Instagram models in lab coats.

What about:

* People with hypertension
* Diabetics
* Women with thyroid issues
* Lifters in their 40s
* People on antidepressants
* Former athletes with wear and tear

**The takeaway**  
We do not know how these formulas work for the rest of us with less than perfect health profiles.

# Side Effects Are Barely Logged

Nausea, jitters, racing heart, sleep issues, crash effects, mood swings ‚Äî all that juicy reality is either ‚Äúnot significant‚Äù or just not mentioned.

**The takeaway**  
Lack of data does not mean it‚Äôs safe. It means no one asked the hard questions or tracked what actually matters once the gym buzz fades.

# So‚Ä¶ Should You Use a Pre Workout?

Imagine mixing 300 mg of caffeine, tingles, beetroot powder, and vague promises of vascularity into a shaker and hoping it‚Äôll fix your motivation crisis. That‚Äôs pre workout. Powerful? Sometimes. Necessary? Rarely. Safe? Depends on whether your scoop looks like a science experiment or a gamble. Let‚Äôs figure out when it‚Äôs actually worth it.

# You might benefit from a pre workout if:

* You‚Äôre dragging yourself into the gym sleep deprived, underfed, or emotionally bruised from your last squat attempt that folded you like a lawn chair.
* Your workouts are high volume or high intensity, and you actually need the help mentally, physically, or just to get through your absurdly long superset playlist.
* You‚Äôve already dialed in the basics: sleep, hydration, nutrition, consistency. Pre is just the cherry on top, not the foundation.
* You know what you‚Äôre taking, why you‚Äôre taking it, and how much is in a scoop. No blind chugging mystery blends with names like ‚ÄúThermonuclear Gutsplosion.‚Äù
* You‚Äôre not hypersensitive to caffeine, niacin, beta alanine, or, well, reality.

# You should probably avoid pre workouts if:

* You‚Äôve had panic attacks, jittery episodes, or moments where your heart did the Macarena mid deadlift.
* You‚Äôre already drinking two to three cups of coffee a day and your adrenals are toast.
* You stack it with fat burners or energy drinks and wonder why your sleep feels like a deleted scene from Fight Club.
* You‚Äôre a beginner. Your gains will come from food, form, and consistency. Not from stimming your soul out of your body.
* You don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in your pre because the label says ‚Äúproprietary blend‚Äù and you just trusted the lightning bolts on the tub.

# My take?

Pre-workouts are tools. Not essentials. Not villains. Just tools.

Used right, they can help you push through a tough session with better focus, energy, and drive. Used wrong, they can fry your nervous system, kill your sleep, and leave you twitching in a cold shower wondering why your ears feel like static radio.

If you‚Äôre going to use them:

* Start with half a scoop and see how your body responds.
* Track more than just energy. Look at your appetite, mood, sleep, and recovery.
* Cycle off every few weeks. Your receptors need a break, and you don't want to rely on a chemical jumpstart just to do three sets of incline press.

Most importantly, don‚Äôt make pre workouts your emotional support supplement. If your session collapses without them, you‚Äôve got bigger issues than caffeine tolerance.

# Smarter Alternatives

Not vibing with the idea of snorting 300 mg of caffeine and praying to the supplement gods you don‚Äôt ascend mid leg day? Good. You‚Äôve got options smart, safer, and surprisingly effective alternatives that won‚Äôt make your skin crawl or your soul leave your body.

**1. Good Old Caffeine**

Sometimes the simplest fix is the best. 100‚Äì200 mg of plain caffeine in pre workout from coffee or caffeine pills hits the sweet spot for most people. No weird blends. No mystery dust. Just the same compound minus the dramatic marketing. Pair with a banana, and you‚Äôre good to go.

Bonus: Caffeine alone has been shown in multiple studies to enhance strength and power. It‚Äôs not inferior.

**2. Carbs Before Barb**

One of the most overlooked pre workout hacks: eat some actual food. A small carb rich snack like fruit, oats can fuel your workout better than any overpriced scoop of neon powder. Glycogen is king when it comes to crushing reps.

**3. Hydration + Electrolytes**

You think you‚Äôre tired, but really you‚Äôre just dry. Dehydration kills performance. A pinch of sea salt in your water or an electrolyte tab pre gym can help sustain energy and pump without frying your nervous system.

**4. Breathwork & Mental Cues**

Sometimes all you need is the right headspace. Quick box breathing or a personal hype ritual can do more than a stim bomb. Remember Ronnie didn‚Äôt need 400 mg of caffeine. He needed a camera and the words ‚ÄúYEAHH BUDDY.‚Äù

**5. Build Your Own Pre Workout**

Don‚Äôt like the shady ‚Äúproprietary blend‚Äù game? Make your own:

* **Caffeine**: 150‚Äì200 mg
* **Creatine monohydrate**: 3‚Äì5 g
* **Beta-alanine**: 2‚Äì3 g (if you‚Äôre into tingles)
* **Citrulline malate**: 6‚Äì8 g
* **salt + water**: For pump and hydration

No surprises. No label lies. Just what works.

# Conclusion: Choose Wisely, Lift Wisely

Pre workouts can be the gym rat‚Äôs best wingman or a chaotic ex who shows up uninvited with heart palpitations and a tingling vendetta. Sure, the right formula can dial you in, slap some focus into your skull, and push you through brutal sets but the wrong one might have you pacing the locker room like you just chugged jet fuel.

""The science isn't dismissive pre workout supplements have legit benefits. More power, better endurance, maybe even an edge in muscle gain. But there are also pre workout side effects: underdosed pre workout ingredients, shady proprietary blends, and enough caffeine to start a small rave.

If your caffeine tolerance is sky high, your diet‚Äôs in check, and you‚Äôve double checked the label like a paranoid chemist you‚Äôll probably be fine. If not? You‚Äôre better off with a strong black coffee, a banana, and a playlist that makes you feel like a menace.

Remember, no scoop can replace grit. Progress comes from consistency, not caffeine induced euphoria. Lift smart, don‚Äôt chase the stim dragon, and always know what you‚Äôre putting in your body especially if it makes your ears itch.

She‚Äôs been his tutor for two years now. She‚Äôs gorgeous, super kind, always positive. Like, legit sunshine in human form. And I swear she treats me a little differently than the other parents.

I did. And now things are worse than ever. Help?","I was recently cleaning out my bookmarks and [found this old throwaway](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9tdkqa/for_years_my_35f_husband_37m_said_that_if_i_want/), and obviously the two posts I made with it. I'm not sure why now, but I feel compelled to write a followup. Maybe it'll give people the bravery to change or at least an example of how sticking with what you know isn't always the best choice.

An obviously very long story short, with the help of those posts and a lot of long nights of thinking, I left my husband. In fact, it took him going away for a long weekend to realize how much happier and at peace I felt without him around... At first the split was amicable, but looking back I think he was just waiting for me to come rushing back to him once I ""realized my mistake."" When that didn't happen and he could see I was actually serious about building a new life for myself, a switch flipped. We only spoke when he needed something from me and eventually that stopped too. Enough about him.

I'm now 42, happier and healthier and more satisfied than I've been my whole life. I picked me and that was the best choice I could've ever made. I lived alone for the first time and my god, the peace of having my own space... unrivaled. I ended up staying in that apartment for 5 years, not a moving box in sight. I put art on the walls, I knew my neighbors. I made a home. I grew my career and went back to school. Made friends, built a little community.

I've done a ton of therapy and realized that the abusive patterns my parents created in childhood were just repeating with my ex. I fell in love, a real love, a supportive love that encourages growth and security. I'm doing new work, work that helps people and is so much more than just chasing money. All of those things have created a life that's more rewarding than I ever thought possible for myself.

I've gone through some really shitty times too, illness, cancer scares, deaths, loss... but I have no idea how I would've come out the other side without the community I'd built around me. Even something as simple as people at your local coffee shop recognizing you is a comfort after feeling adrift and alone for so long. Anyway, if I were to respond to myself from 7 years ago, this is what I would say.

>Leave the loser. He doesn't care about you, never did. He only cares about what you can do for him and now that you aren't serving him... well. Just go. You are capable of doing difficult things, and you are worthy of the work it takes to accomplish them. Trust your abilities, trust your gut - it's been screaming at you for years now, honey. Life can be so much more than you've experienced, but you have to make it happen for yourself.

Firstly, I want to clarify I'm talking about people wanting to date for serious relationships, not hook-ups or short-term things.

I'm really confused how dating happens in Macau. From my impression, dating apps (Bumble, Tinder, and Coffee Meets Bagel) don't really have many people on them. Locals generally seem introverted, so I feel like approaching a stranger would be breaking some unwritten social rule. I haven't seen a ton of interest groups specifically allowing young adults to meet other young adults. I recently read an article also on Macau News implying that dating is kinda dead here (https://macaonews.org/news/city/macau-dating-singles-relationships-macao/).

But there are still a lot of young adults here and couples, so they must find each other some way. So, I'm curious, how do local couples actually get together?

The textbook is old enough it's waxing on about the importance of radio when providing information to masses, and the tensions between authoritarian regimes and more socialist growth due to the proliferation of information among masses.

Naturally, Andor comes to mind. Rebel radios. Space and distance. Secure communications. Crystals, the fantasy spice in a scifi story. I'm sipping coffee and reading about the differences between Shannon and Weaver's communication model and Gerbner's model.

""It's quantum,"" I say out of nowhere.

QUANTUM crystals. [Mass Effect already applied](https://apricity.fandom.com/wiki/Quantum_Entanglement_Communication) the scifi technobabble to secure, distance-agnostic communications by entangling quantum bits between receivers and transmitters. It's distance-agnostic, and if you squint you can kinda sidle on over to adding the fiction of frequencies to it; rather than quantum bits you have quantum bands, for example, allowing crystals in a certain spectrum to be aligned (tuned) but new crystals opening up new spectrums to jump around on the pirate frequencies. Take into account the many different scifi ways space could warp a scifi quantum crystal frequency, and you get the need to dial it in. Someone else mentioned quantum computing in a discussion about the SE1 navigation computer used to escape the meteor shower, and it fits neatly here too. Potentially an old enough tech to no longer be in use or consideration from a security standpoint, but reliable if you know how.

Personally, I've grown out of the need to have every bit of fantasy in Star Wars reduced to something explainable. It takes the magic out of it, and hamstrings further creation. This, though, felt really satisfying to consider - a personal lagniappe to an already-wonderful story. And a good distraction from writing research reviews ><.",1,1749043127.0,andor,1,1.0,False

1l357ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/decadeology/comments/1l357ol/a_cracked_style_post_about_how_social_media_made/,A Cracked style post about how social media made sure we never have a golden age ever again like before.,"# 5 Ways Social Media Has Made Sure We Never Have A Golden Age Ever Again

Once upon a time, people looked back on certain eras and said, ‚ÄúAh yes, the *Golden Age.*‚Äù Prominent golden ages such as the 1950s, the Enlightenment, or the 1990s when Taco Bell still cared about dignity, people believed the world had *peaked*‚Äîor at least found a moment of peace, creativity, and hope.

But now? We‚Äôre in the age of 24/7 doomscrolling, global cringe synchronization, and a constant reminder that if anything is good, someone already ruined it in the quote tweets. Thanks to social media, the idea of a ""Golden Age"" is dead, buried, and probably got ratioed into oblivion.

Here are five reasons why:

# 5. Everything Awful Is Always Visible, All the Time

Back in the old days, you could go your entire life without knowing that 70% of the planet is either on fire, underwater, or in a screaming match on public transit. Now? A 5 second scroll shows you famine in Sudan, billionaires joyriding in space, and someone screaming at a Walgreens cashier about vaccines‚Äîbefore your coffee even cools down.

Social media makes sure the worst things humanity has to offer are constantly at the top of your feed. Bad news used to travel slowly. Now it has a ring light, a TikTok account, and a dedicated subreddit. There‚Äôs no room for collective optimism when we‚Äôre all mainlining a global misery montage.

# 4. Cultural Homogenization Turned Everything into the Same Beige Sludge

Remember when different eras had different styles, fashion, and attitudes? Now you can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre in Berlin or Boise because every caf√© has the same hanging Edison bulbs and matcha lattes served in rustic mugs on reclaimed wood. Social media turned culture into an infinite feedback loop where everything is trend-chased into sameness.

Everyone‚Äôs trying to go viral, and that means copying the last thing that went viral. What do you get when every restaurant, artist, and tourist destination is trying to be Instagrammable? The creative equivalent of a white wall with ‚ÄúLIVE LAUGH LOVE‚Äù painted on it in faux-cursive.

# 3. Inequality Is More Visible, and That Visibility Is Weaponized

Sure, economic inequality has *always* existed. But now, thanks to social media, you get to experience it in real time while billionaires livestream from their gold plated bathtubs. Meanwhile, people in your feed are GoFundMe ing their rent and to pay off their medical debt.

Worse, the platforms are built to *amplify* envy and resentment. The algorithm wants you mad. It thrives on rage, jealousy, and that deep, nameless dread you feel after watching a 19 year old influencer buy a mansion by lip-syncing into their phone for 6 months.

# 2. There‚Äôs No Unified Culture Anymore‚ÄîJust Infinitely Fragmented Fandoms

Golden Ages typically need some kind of cultural center‚Äîa shared music scene, a common artistic movement, or at least a mutual agreement that *something* matters. Now? Everyone‚Äôs in their own algorithmic bubble, and those bubbles don‚Äôt just not overlap‚Äîthey're actively hostile to each other.

You might think the whole world‚Äôs talking about the latest prestige TV show‚Äîuntil you find out it got canceled because only 12,000 people actually watched it. Meanwhile, another 20 million are role-playing as medieval werewolves on TikTok. There is no monoculture anymore. Just microclimates of weirdness, clout, and drama.

# 1. Nostalgia Is Now Instant, So the Present Never Gets a Chance

We used to wait decades to look back on a decade fondly. Now people get nostalgic for *2019.* There are TikToks eulogizing ""pre-COVID summer"" like they‚Äôre ancient history. When the present never gets a chance to breathe, it never gets to feel meaningful.

Social media compresses time. Memes last hours, discourse cycles burn out in minutes, and anything sincere is mocked into irony before it even has a chance. You can‚Äôt build a Golden Age when every moment is already a joke, a regret, or a trend that died yesterday.

I've had an ""official"" diagnosis that's followed me in my medical charts since I was 19. I've tried just about every class of migraine medication, including off-label uses of anti-depressants and anti-siezure meds, as well as beta blockers in prevantative applications. 

I thought my life changed when I was prescribed Ubrelvy. Then the neurologist recommended I try Nurtec, since the Ubrelvy didn't always work, and that was better. Brought abortive time down from about 2.5 hours to around 45 minutes. I still had almost daily headaches that could be managed with caffeine and tylenol, but using the Nurtec seemed to cut down on the weekly occurrences of migraines (about 4 a week or so, on average).

At my last appointment back on May 16th, I'd finally jumped through all the hoops required by my PBM to look at using Nurtec as a preventative. At that point, the neurologist suggested we might look at Qulipta instead, since it was a daily preventative that works on the same receptors as Nurtec, but wouldn't require the even or odd day cycles. And since I'd already met the requirements to use Nurtec as a preventative, there shouldn't be any issues with my PBM for a script for Qulipta. So that's what we did.

I took my first dose that day, and...nothing. Like, _literally_ nothing. No more daily headaches. No more migraines. No more aura. No more popping tylenol & guzzling caffeine. (I still drink my morning coffee. I am not a masochist.) For the last 2 & 1/2 weeks, I have been symptom free. Today was my first breakthrough migraine, and I was able to kill it early w/ tylenol & Nurtec. Took a couple hours to start feeling normal again. But my god, the past 2.5 weeks have been fucking _amazing_. If this trend continues, and I only have to experience a breakthrough every couple weeks or so, I will not utter _one single complaint._

I know it's still too early to tell how this will play out over the long term, but going from an average 4-5 migraines a week and daily headaches to not so much as a single headache and just 1 minor breakthrough migraine? For the first time in my life I'm hopeful I can experience life from the other side. My greatest wish is that I'm not alone in this experience.

2. whenever you get the ""they did me so bad  when xyz"". LOUDLY ( if possible, else just firmly in your head ) repeat : ""IDC"" ""I Literally do not care"" ""doesn't matter"". And you'll condition your brain to not think of that so often.
3. remind yourself of the good things you did for them when you were in the same position as them and ACTIVELY chose not to hurt them in anyway.
4. remember you gave your 100%, have no regrets and bring back all your focus and energy to yourself.

„ÄîA Dissertation on the True Nature of Artificial Intelligence Writing Platforms:  
The Advanced Algorithmic Typewriter„Äï

Introduction

Since the dawn of writing, tools have shaped the way humans express ideas. From the quill to the typewriter, from the typewriter to the word processor, and now from the word processor to artificial intelligence, each leap has been about increasing efficiency, flexibility, and creative potential. Today, as AI writing platforms proliferate, there is much debate and misunderstanding about what they truly are. At their core, AI writing tools are not mysterious or sentient beings‚Äîthey are, fundamentally, advanced typewriters: algorithmic instruments for turning human intention into text.

I. The Evolution of Writing Tools

The quill and ink gave way to the mechanical precision of the typewriter. The typewriter was superseded by the digital word processor, which enabled editing, formatting, and collaboration. In 2024 and beyond, AI-powered writing tools have become the latest evolution, integrating artificial intelligence to assist, accelerate, and sometimes even co-create content [1].

Each transition was met with skepticism, but ultimately, each tool was embraced as a means to make writing more accessible and efficient.

II. What Is an AI Writing Platform?

An AI writing platform is a software system powered by large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude, or similar technologies. These platforms take human instructions‚Äîprompts, outlines, or even just a topic‚Äîand generate text in response. They can draft articles, emails, essays, or even full-length books. But crucially, they do not think or create independently; they operate as extensions of the user's intent, much like a typewriter responds to the touch of the keys [2].

III. The Typewriter Analogy

- Mechanical Typewriter: Converts finger pressure into ink on paper.
- Word Processor: Converts keystrokes into digital text, enabling editing and formatting.
- AI Writing Platform: Converts prompts, instructions, and edits into algorithmically generated text, using vast data and sophisticated linguistic models.

In all cases, the tool is inert without human direction. The AI does not possess agency or authorship; it is a sophisticated conduit for human creativity and instruction [3].

IV. Human Agency and Authorship

The misconception that AI ""writes"" on its own ignores the fundamental reality:  
- The user must envision, instruct, and refine.  
- The platform executes, suggests, and iterates, but the final product is shaped by the human's vision, choices, and edits.

Just as an author is not required to disclose whether they used a pen, pencil, typewriter, or word processor, there is no inherent need to disclose AI use when the human is directing the process and making creative decisions [4].

V. The Algorithmic Typewriter in Practice

AI writing tools offer:  
- Speed: Drafts and revisions are produced rapidly.  
- Flexibility: Style, tone, and format can be adjusted instantly.  
- Collaboration: Some platforms allow real-time editing and feedback, much like Google Docs but with an AI assistant.

Yet, all of this is in service to the user's intent. The AI is a tool, not a replacement for human creativity or judgment [5].

VI. Implications for Authorship and Intellectual Property

The output of AI writing platforms, when shaped by human instruction and editing, is the intellectual property of the user. There is no legal or ethical mandate to disclose the use of AI tools, just as there is none for other writing technologies, provided the final work reflects human creative choices [4].

Conclusion

Artificial intelligence writing platforms are not autonomous creators. They are, at their essence, the latest and most advanced typewriters‚Äîalgorithmic engines that translate human vision and instruction into text. The creative force remains the person at the keyboard, directing, shaping, and owning the final product.

In the end, the story of writing technology is the story of human ingenuity. AI is just the newest chapter‚Äîa typewriter powered by algorithms, awaiting the touch of a human mind.

Parehas kasi kaming natutuwa sa host na ‚Äòto kaya excited ako.

A was offered a fulltime ‚ÄúVideo Editor‚Äù para sa branding agency ni Noontime show host na nagv-vlog. So A travelled to NCR for the interview. A was amazed sa ‚Äòorange‚Äô building ni Host. There are plenty of businesses inside that this Host is promoting, probably owned or partner.

Pagkadating niya sa building, the guard told A, ‚ÄúKanina ka pa hinihintay ni Onion.‚Äù 

Onion, that was the name na dapat niya raw hanapin pagka-akyat niya. Same Onion na minention ng kausap niya sa e-mail.

A was surprised that no HR was there to do the interview but the actual owner, the noontime show host. So.. the noontime show host is Onion? 

To welcome A, Onion gave A a drink from one of his businesses sa loob ng building na yun. Wala siyang idea anong klaseng drink ‚Äòyun, but lasa raw limang kutsara ng brown sugar na hinalo sa isang baso ng tubig.

From that approach, nabaitan na talaga si A kay Host. Caring at galante yung vibes sa employees. Ang layo niya raw gumalaw sa TV kapag nandoon siya sa business niya. Businessman vibes? Galing.

Hinanap ni Host ang laptop ni A para makita works niya but it happened na hindi niya dala, only A‚Äôs CV and requirements. The person from the e-mail also did not give A a notice about bringing a device. Usually, according to A, creatives at HR daw ang nagche-check ng portfolio during interview or before the interview. At least based on A‚Äôs series of interviews. The Host gave A some advices sa paga-apply, and A thought Host‚Äôs right. Dalhin lagi ang laptop. 

So, the Host asked A, ‚ÄúAno ba hanap mo sa isang company?‚Äù the host‚Äôs Filipino accent was quite challenging and A described the host as super utal sa ‚ÄòS‚Äô, but A is glad na they were able to understand.

A answered, and told Host ‚Äòjust the basic benefits‚Äô. A meant government mandated benefits and leaves. 

The Host then told A, ‚ÄúAlam mo advice ko sayo, if ganyan yung gusto mo, benefits. Mag-apply ka sa big companies na.‚Äù 

A got so confused. Friend A thought the job is full time but the Host clarified it‚Äôs full time but no benefits. Just fixed salary. Wala raw kasing pera pa para doon at start up palang. 

‚ÄúYung iba ko business may benefits sila. Pero iba yun. Ito start up palang.‚Äù 

Lahat naman ata ng businesses niya bago palang? Paano niya ija-justify ‚Äòyun? Haha

Then Host asked for A‚Äôs asking salary, A answered. But the Host seems to have a different thought. So I asked A ‚Äúwhat was your asking salary?‚Äù It was below 21K. 

The role is to do the videography and video editing, must be traveling because it‚Äôs for the Host‚Äôs vlogs. Work schedule is Monday to Saturday, while Saturday is only half day. A thought he will be working as Video Editor for the Host‚Äôs businesses inside the building dahil nga ‚Äúbranding agency‚Äù daw. It turns out na exclusively for vlogs pala. At yun din ang hinahanap ni Host sa Portfolio niya.

Ang confusing nito kasi yung kausap niya sa e-mail hindi man lang naging clear sa actual job.

Lumabas ng room si A na devastated at disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è Pagkalabas niya, binilang niya ilang business ang meron sa building na ‚Äòyon na pag-aari ni Host aka Onion. 

‚ÄúMay barber shop sya. Coffee shop. Korean resto bar. At Bar!‚Äù kung maka-kwento si A parang kapatid niya si Host sa pagka-proud.

1l34vyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/somnigastronomy/comments/1l34vyp/sativa_jarritos/,Sativa Jarritos,"I awoke feverishly to document the most rare and coveted Jarritos flavor ever conceptualized. For those unfamiliar, Jarritos is a delicious (real) brand of soda sold in a glass bottle. It comes in flavors like pineapple, mango, strawberry, guava, tamarind...

The Jarritos flavor in my dream was called ""sativa"", which apparently referred to a strange fruit I had never heard of. The color of the soda was pale and almost milky, ever so slightly green--imagine the color of a mojito--but mostly translucent with a slight glow to it. It also contained rainbow boba/those little bubbles that pop and have flavored liquid in them. The color scheme of the boba was similar to halo halo: Ube purple, pinkish red, jade, yellow, and [color that does not exist yet and cannot be perceived by the human eye, perhaps only identifiable as part of a ""multicolor"" scheme, kind of looks black on its own]. The boba were small so they can fit through the neck of the bottle, and filled up about a quarter or half inch at the bottom of the bottle. In addition to the original Jarritos bottle, the soda also came in plastic: either in tall opaque cups (like movie theater sodas and bubble tea) or in a clear flat container (like supermarket sprinkles come in).

The first time I tried to purchase Sativa Jarritos, I failed. I left the market with an inferior rare flavor, which appeared to just be tea-milk with boba and ice cubes that were made of black coffee. I realized my mistake but had to keep going. The coffee flavor was alright, but once I got down to just the ice cubes it got sort of sickening. It refilled itself like it was never-ending. I gave it to my friend.

Finally I got back to the market and was searching for dinner. But there was something more important...I went back to the stall with the Jarritos. There were still plenty Sativa flavor left. I stared for a long time and asked myself if I was prepared to spend up to three or even three-seventy-five on a strange drink that might be gross in reality. I have a habit of purchasing food items for their looks, and my aesthetic taste is regrettably clown-like, resulting in many disappointing experiences with rainbow fun-shaped foods. I could heard the voices of my loved ones urging me not to do it again, to just focus on finding dinner, and to leave this stall that only sold soda and caramelized onions...but this was my one chance. I considered just buying the flat container of Jarritos, which was smaller and less of a commitment, but when I got in line I noticed the package was open and that grossed me out. More people were getting in line now. I had to hurry, lest they sell out of Sativa. Mercifully there were still some left. I got back in line and purchased it in the original Jarritos bottle like God intended.

The flavor? Not bad. It was very mild, it contained the suggestion of mint but didn't actually taste like it. It had the essence of artificial pineapple that is hard to describe--you know the one, that clear gummy bear flavor that doesn't actually taste like pineapple but just tastes GOOD. Some notes of guava. Overall it was like a fancy muted Sprite or a Fresca. Less fizzy than your typical Jarritos. The boba were tapioca and tasted tropical. The experience was worth it.",14,1749041846.0,somnigastronomy,3,1.0,False

1l34sqg,https://i.redd.it/qk775dhmqw4f1.png,TRADE WITH INTENTION - DON‚ÄôT BUY ANYTHING EXCEPT $USAU RIGHT NOW,"Every dollar matters.  
Forget coffee, small expenses, and random trades-focus only on $USAU.

Here‚Äôs why the next 30 days are critical:

MANDATORY INSTITUTIONAL BUYING:

* Russell 2000 & 3000 index inclusion forces major ETFs (IWM, IWV, VTWO, TWOK) managing over $10.6 trillion to buy $USAU before June 30
* Institutional ownership is just 14.42%-set to surge

MASSIVE UNDERVALUATION:

* Fully permitted CK Gold Project valued at $4.75 billion
* Current market cap \~$150M-deeply undervalued

SHORT-TERM VOLATILITY = YOUR FRIEND:

* Institutions will swing the price to shake out weak hands-buy every dip
* Volatility gives you the edge to accumulate before the big inflows

PRICE TARGET (30 Days): $17‚Äì$25+ (35‚Äì100%+ upside)

ACTION REQUIRED-RIGHT NOW:  
Don‚Äôt spend elsewhere. Buy only $USAU aggressively.  
Massive institutional inflows are coming. The opportunity is now.

We're both struggling with our mental health and i feel like we kinda bonded over that. Also we're both kinda dissapointed with our course, she's disappointed cause it's not interesting to her and i am because i just didn't find my place in this academic environment to the point of burning out, i was also mobbed by a professor.
She really opened up to me, telling me all about her abusive relationship and generally told me a lot of her lore. I appreciate, that she told me these stuff and i tried my best to support her, sometimes sacrificing my needs for space, which i know wasn't a smart move.
By then i was in a better place mentally and just had more energy to be the fun friend, coming to her with a lot of questions, i also was drinking back then. Sometimes she would spontaneously call me to go out on a coffee or a beer, or to study with her, but this study session would end up in the theatre on some random movie we went for shits and giggles. 
She introduced me to her friends from other fields and if she was planning something for them for a birthdays, etc, she would show me her projects and i really liked that. Really, she was like a sunny in this dark hole i found myself in.
I tried to get all this passion back in the same way, but i couldn't, especially when the burnout had started.

When i got worse, i needed to cut out some stress from my life to heal. I've got quieter and stopped drinking, stopped talking with my judgy environment, had no tea about others to spill and turned to my passions like painting and writing, started therapy, 
everything for keeping my peace. 

When we're talking after that change, i feel like she's bored with me. Usually i ask her about her stuff and try to cherish and laugh with her or tell her about my hobbies and what i want to excel at, but she got so judgy about my questions, like whatever i say is stupid shit to ask about, and treats me like ""it's not that deep"", whatever topic i would suggest, there's also passive-aggresion from her and sometimes lying about the stuff she said before, so I'm the one who didn't listen and she's always right.
When i try to confront it and ask her, if she's bored with me or angry at something i do, she just laughs at me for overthinking. This friendship is so weird rn, because she acts like this, but at the same time shows effort, texting to me about what's up in her life or asks me if i want to hang out. I'm confused.

I know she has a lot of stuff going on, she never left that abusive guy, even if me and her other friends encouraged her to do this. Nearly every painful thing that happens in her life is connected to him. 
I really want to support her, share our passions and be friends like in the old days, but have a feeling that she detached.

Where you ever in this type of situation? Is there anything to fix this friendship? What can i do?
If you read all of it i deeply, deeeeply aprecciate it‚ù§Ô∏è

1l34rn1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l34rn1,Review: Dreams Natura,"Stay 2/21 to 2/27 - 2 mid-30‚Äôs adults and 2 children ages 6 and 9.

This is going to be long but will be worth the read! Overall this is a GREAT value for families, especially ones with younger kids. 

Layout: This resort has such a great layout for parents with kids. It is small, which makes it very easy for a parent to allow a child to venture a little on their own but still be within sight. From almost all chairs you could see the hot tub, pools, slides, part of the lazy river, the climbing wall, zipline, and parts of the beach. It never took us long to walk from one place to another or make a run back to our room. Maybe 3 minutes tops.

Room: We booked a preferred ocean front king and requested a rollaway bed. We really enjoyed having the preferred suite with the ocean front view and balcony jacuzzi. After spending a morning at the pool there were days that we lounged on our balcony in our jetted tub simply because we could and it was very relaxing after the hustle and bustle pool side. Facing the ocean meant we had a front row seat to all the weddings and the receptions in the evening. We really enjoyed this, especially the fireworks they did one night. However, if someone needs a really quiet room this would not be it. Between the splash pad area and the parties, things were a little noisy until 10pm. At 10pm though everything shut down and the resort was pretty much dead from then until the next morning. This is not a party resort in the slightest. The room was very spacious and our family of four had a lot of space even with the rollaway bed in the room. The couch could fit two smaller children and the rollaway can comfortably fit a teenage child or someone around or under 5 or so feet tall. If I had to nit pick anything to complain about it would be the beds. Everything including the pillows and the pull out couch is extremely firm. It wasn't a deal breaker by any means but out of all sleeping surfaces the rollaway was the most comfy. If someone is sensitive with their sleep habits this could be a deal breaker. Pro tip- if you run the AC all day like in the US then your room is going to feel damp or ‚Äúsmell moldy‚Äù like I see many people complain about. I'd encourage guests to utilize local solutions like opening the screen on the balcony and utilizing the ceiling fan in the room for a more enjoyable experience while in their rooms. 

Service: Service here was wonderful from ordering drinks by the pool to service at meal times, everyone worked hard to provide good service. Housekeeping always provided top notch service and our mini fridge was restocked every day. We had an issue with our safe not working when we first arrived and they had security up to fix it within 10 minutes of our call.

Beach: The beach is not as bad as people make it out to be. It was murky like river water a few days but a few days it was clear enough to see through. Not isle mujeres crystal blue clear but I wouldn't call it brown like many of the reviews. It wasn't gross and it didn't smell. There was some seaweed but not much and the grounds crews did a great job of getting it cleaned up. The sand is powdery and soft. We generally aren't beach people but we spent a whole day on the beach building sand sculptures and stirred up some interest with our sand dolphin. There are mangroves on each side of this resort with crocs. We did have one red flag day where no one was allowed in the water because one of the crocs spent the day swimming back and forth from each side. The resort had guards out on the beach the whole time and we never had an issue with it. The areas are heavily monitored so that everyone stays safe. The crocs really are a nonissue.

Pools: The pools might be smaller than some people are used to especially if they travel a lot or do big AI's but we never felt crowded in them. We always had lots of room to swim and lounge and our kids played on the steps and the shallow areas without contention. The water was always warm and inviting. Since we purposely picked dates that avoided spring break, the chair game really wasn't an issue unless you arrived after 10am. We went down late one morning around 11am and had to wait for a spot to open up until after lunch. No biggie for us. We just lounged in the lazy river until then. Outside of that we always found at least two chairs together. Our favorite spot was near the hot tub next to the lazy river because we could go from that to the pool and be right next to the lunch shack and bar. It was a great spot for keeping kids and adults happy.

Activities: The entertainment staff tries really hard to get everyone to participate in activities but this resort is very laid back and family friendly. Zero planet hollywood vibes here. They were very friendly and engaging and great with the kids. They had the schedule posted in several places and hosted activities at each pool and on the beach. The evening shows were also a nice treat for the kids. I would say they weren't super enthralling for adults but my kids liked every show we went to. We loved the lazy river and spent a lot of time there. The kids did slides a few times, and we went to the arcade area at least once a day. Having the explorer's club was a nice option especially on the day we scheduled spa time. I would say the club is more geared towards kids under 10. They weren't super strict about ages at the arcade and as long as we were there the kids played whenever they felt like it. If I had to be nit picky about something it would have to be the opening times of certain activities. The lazy river and slides opened at 10am and closed at 5pm. The climbing wall was only open for about 2 hours a few days a week and the same is true for the zipline. The kids arcade never opened before 1pm and that all you can eat ice cream claim doesn't start until after then either, which was a disappointment to one of my children üòÜ. 

Spa: This is a MUST do for adults that come here, it is beautiful. The hydrotherapy was really fun and the couples massage was very relaxing. (Skip the vapor room and spend extra time in the sauna and thank me later.) This is where being preferred paid off by use of a 25% off. Pro-tip: If you book an 80 minute service you get the hydrotherapy included for free. My husband and I did the couples hot stone massage and it combined with the hydrotherapy was a solid 10/10.

Food: Everyone always wants to know about the food! For an AI it was good but I always say to people when you travel do so with the expectation that the food is going to be different from its american counterparts. Kids will probably be the most picky in this regard. The milk didn't ""taste like milk"" to them and the comfort items of pancakes and such were ""different"". As an adult I think that's to be expected. If people come with that in mind I don't think there is much to complain about. We embraced ordering more authentic dishes and were delighted with most of them. We opted to eat at restaurants over the buffet most nights and really enjoyed our meals. Notables - the flank steak at El Patio, the ribeye and chicken with stuffed potato at the Bluewater Grill; short ribs and chicken at Bordeaux; and the pizza at Portofino. We also really enjoyed the preferred club lounge for small midday bites and drinks that we could take up to our room. We did the buffet a few times for breakfast and lunch and the notables here would be the homemade taco bar and the made to order omelettes. Outside of that, on the buffet, I was personally only a fan of a few items like the chicken stew, grilled chicken, and fajitas but I'm a foodie at heart so buffets are hit or miss with me. The grill by the pool was a hit with my kids. My son ate so many cheeseburgers there I figured he'd get sick of them but never did. From an adult perspective everything at the grill is pre-made and then reheated so it wasn't super appealing for me. I usually opted to wait for them to open the taco bar near the other pool and got those which were really good. Room service was good the night we did that as well. The chicken wings and pizza were the favs there. Himitsu is the only restaurant that takes reservations and that is only for the hibachi tables. 100% worth a visit, it was our favorite. Pro-tip: they open reservations for that on Sundays at 7am and book a week at a time so if you come later in the week they will be full. You just need to plan to make that reservation with the concierge on Sunday morning. All the smoothies at Coco Cafe were great and the cappuccino was a go to for us each morning. Ice cream here isn't available until after 1pm and if you‚Äôre looking for Starbuck type coffee you‚Äôll be disappointed.

Things to note: 
*The water at the end of the slides is 4.5ft deep. They will not allow adults to wait in the water near the end of the slides. You can't even be in that zone at all as they go down so our six year old with limited swimming skills could not go alone since she could barely touch. 
*The lazy river is 3.7 ft deep and most of the kids could touch, however the current is strong at the entry and exit point so some kids struggled to get in and out on their own. I hopped off my float several times to help struggling kiddos make it out. 
*The tunnel slide is pitch black the whole way and makes you feel like you're drowning. We enjoyed all the other slides though. 
*We never had a problem getting tubes for the slides or the lazy river. 
*The mangroves smell earthy, not bad. If people expect vanilla lavender scents all day out in nature they should reset their expectations. 
*There is only one swim up bar and service there can be slow since it also serves the beach area. *There were weddings here almost every single day but it never interfered with our stay. This is 100% a family resort. The club isn't really a club but more of a bar and everything is basically over by 10pm. This is not a place I would recommend for couples or adults only parties.
*This resort lives and dies by use of the Hyatt All Inclusive app. No one ever really tells you much about the resort when you get there, the app is where you will get all of your information. It will have the food menus, activity items, and access to the services like booking experiences, room service, and making housekeeping requests. 
*Also the ""VIP"" person you see once you are finished checking in are the timeshare guys. We politely declined their talk and they didn't bother us more about it. 

Overall we really loved the opportunity to relax. We didn't make a ton of plans or schedules because we didn't want to exhaust ourselves on vacation. I loved that my kids had activities to keep themselves entertained in the moments that I just wanted to read near the pool and I felt safe letting them venture a bit without needing to be right beside them the whole time. I learned for myself I'm probably too bougie for my budget lol. While nothing stands out as bad in the least I really enjoyed the more refined moments of the spa, and eating good food and craved a bit more excitement in the evenings. My husband was happy with everything and had no complaints. He's ready to book a trip every year now! Overall a really great experience.",10,1749041514.0,AllInclusiveResorts,1,1.0,False
1l34rd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1l34rd0/did_i_ruin_it_all/,Did I ruin it all?,"There was this guy I dated for a month and a half. We matched on a dating app and had really intense chemistry from the beginning. We quickly exchanged numbers and talked every day on FaceTime, sometimes more than once a day. I would say we had much in common and felt good in others company. First minute into the first date and we kissed in his flat, which he expressed he would like to even before we met and I also thought the same thing.

We had a nice date and continued to talk every day. He just got a new cat, and it just had moved in‚Ä¶so we couldn‚Äôt meet at my place the second time which was fine for me. He was very sweet and seemed really into me with giving me cute nicknames and telling me how attractive I am etc. He quickly became an important person in my life.

For the third date he suggested going out with his best friends, which I took as a good sign. He also said he would love to get to know my mum maybe someday. We exchanged Shirts to keep the other one company till we see each other again and kept them as cushion covers with he doing it before me. I thought it was really cute. He also told me that I am important and special to him.

The last time we met I asked how we stand and that‚Äôs when things changed. He said he had so much going on with work right now, his cat (which behaved a little weird) and his health so he wasn‚Äôt really sure if he was ready right now. I believed him because he was really eager to leave his work, which he was really unhappy and stressed about with all the time and wanted to go to a college in September and had a lot of planning to do. He was even on sick leave because he couldn‚Äôt handle the work and his Boss anymore, which was an absolute bad person as he told me and tried to make his life hell. Also my friends didn‚Äôt think there was something wrong with his explanation. It was really a stressful time for him but he assured me that it was his problem and had nothing to do with me. As i am an overthinker I told him he could just tell me if he didn‚Äôt feel the same about me and just be honest, but he still said it didn‚Äôt had to do something with me. He even said he didn‚Äôt want to date someone new till he entered college and  managed all his stuff. In hindsight I know this is the point I should have left but I didn‚Äôt bc I kinda still had hope and really liked him. I also asked if I interpreted getting to know his friends wrong and he said something like: Oh I am just very open and if I think they get along with my friends I introduce them. I know everyone is different but I personally wouldn‚Äôt introduce my friends on the third date if I wasn‚Äôt really sure about them. Of course I was really sad about his decision and the person that i am it made me sad and i cried in front of him and he comforted me as best as he could.

After that contact declined bc he wanted space which I accepted bc I thought it would also be good for me. He also got a second cat and he said he has a lot of stress bc it doesn‚Äôt really did get along with his first cat and bc of this he haven‚Äôt slept in a few days and didn‚Äôt want to communicate with everyone. Still I saw his Insta Storys where he went out for a coffee with his best friend etc. I also had a weird feeling that made check his dating profile which he updated. Previously he had deleted his apps but he said it was just because he was looking for friends. We had a little bit of a fight but settled it with him saying maybe we can start again over someday. I agreed and we decided to send each other the T-Shirts back, even though he said I could keep his or throw it away. It was a basic white T-Shirt which he has probably 10 or more and it wasn‚Äôt something special to him. I still wanted to send him the Shirt and said that I will do it shortly. I did do the next week but without telling him I did it bc we just spoke about it the week before.

We continued to snap each other but like nothing special till i had a weak moment and did send him a normal snap with a ‚ÄûMiss you‚Äú text. He deleted me on Snap and I am pretty sure he blocked me. I was really angry at myself and I still am bc I felt like I overstepped his boundaries and I felt really stupid bc of that. That was when the real stress began. He still had my shirt, which was special to me and had a emotional value, because I bought it last year when I was in America for the first time. And yes, he knew about the value it had for me.

After one and a half week I wrote him if he did send my shirt bc I haven‚Äôt received anything yet which he declined. I told him to do it soon so I can close the whole situation for me. The next week I received a package but it wasn‚Äôt my stuff but instead his stuff which came back bc he didn‚Äôt pick it up. I did send it again although I could have just thrown it away. He said he didn‚Äôt pick it up bc he thought it was a scam and he didn‚Äôt expect something and blamed me that I didn‚Äôt tell him, even though I said I will send him his stuff shortly. I didn‚Äôt think he needed an extra confirmation when we talked about it the week before that. In the meantime he didn‚Äôt send my shirt and I kinda had to ‚Äûthreaten‚Äú him that I would come and pick it up myself. He replied he would do it the next day and eventually it came later the next week.

I blocked him on Insta and his number and even took a break of Insta. In short, he had my shirt for a total of two and a half months, five weeks of that where he couldn‚Äôt  manage to send my shirt and I managed to do it two times. I haven‚Äôt seen him for three months but couldn‚Äôt close the situation bc of that damned Shirt, that just arrived like two weeks ago.

I carry a severe amount of guilt and shame that I didn‚Äôt left much sooner when I should have but we had such an special connection (I thought) that I couldn‚Äôt leave and maybe I was just more into him then he was into me but then I don‚Äôt understand whey he wasn‚Äôt just honest with me, even if he always preached how important open and honest communication is. I also ruminate about if it ended differently when I did not send the ‚ÄûMiss you‚Äú Snap. I still don‚Äôt think that justifies his actions for his behavior to just keep my stuff for as long as he did, exspecially because he knew, how important it is for me. I really wanted more with that person but now I wonder if I even knew him enough? We only met four times but always for two days bc I spend the night there and we talked every day on FaceTime in between, sometimes more then once a day or for hours. I know I am a person that attaches quickly but he also matched my energy so I thought he wanted the same. I still catch myself thinking of him and what could have been if I behaved differently, especially after it was his birthday yesterday. And I know it will take sometime getting over him completely. I also still have the stupid hope of forgiving him and me and  trying to reconnect someday. I really don‚Äôt know if I should or should not. I don‚Äôt even know if I should unblock him someday on Insta or just keep him blocked forever. I know it always takes two but I still have the feeling I ruined it all and it‚Äôs all my fault. I just feel lost. I had trust issues even before that so how I am supposed to trust someone again and let him in my life after that happend? I wonder, if he even liked me or I meant something to him. Still, I hate the idea of never talking to him or seeing him again. ",1,1749041492.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

1l34qbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1l34qbx/recent_end_of_relationship_new_man/,"Recent end of relationship, new man?","I‚Äôm 23, and I‚Äôve just came out of a 4.5 year relationship and now I might be starting things with someone else already ??

Relationship from the start was flawed, he cheated on me 1 week into the relationship making out with a girl outside of the club in front of me (he identified as bisexual). I continued things (most to my friends dismissal). He was looking back, quite controlling, and emotionally charged which he took out on me. My sex drive became low during the relationship because of his behaviours and the relationship cracks began to show.

We lived together for 2 years, he decided start of this year he wanted to move back to his home town (300 miles away from where we lived), and I didn‚Äôt want to move with him as I had a stable job, all my friends around me and family an hour away. The relationship ended mutually as we didn‚Äôt fall out with eachother. 

I‚Äôve moved into a new property and it‚Äôs been 2 weeks since we‚Äôve parted ways. Was horny, downloaded Grindr and started chatting to this guy who offered to give me head. I went round to his after drinks with work, we kissed, chatted, he gave my head and I left. Whilst I was out he asked for face pics, never sent as I looked rough from work.

Next day I was out drinking again, had a couple drinks and thought I‚Äôd sent him a face pic that he‚Äôd asked for previous day, we text whilst I was out, ended up near his and I said I could come round if he wanted. I ended up back at his, we kissed, cuddled, talked and gave eachother head. I ended up staying the night and the next day we kissed, cuddled and talked in the morning and he walked me half way home.

We‚Äôve been texting for the last 4 days since and he said he would like to meet me for a coffee, so last night I shoot my shot and asked him, we plan to meet for a couple chill drinks and food end of the week after work. 

Now the whole point of all the above explanation, was that Id kinda decided I was going to just work on myself and stay single for a bit and improve self care and fitness. However this lad, I don‚Äôt know what it is about him, but I‚Äôm attracted to him, he has a cute smile, nice body and I like our chat. He is 10+ years older, which tbh I‚Äôm not bothered by, he‚Äôs got a Spanish accent which is really fit to me, he‚Äôs intelligent and lowkey looks like a younger Pedro Pascal (my biggest celebrity crush off all time). 

I‚Äôm basically conflicted as I‚Äôd said all this stuff to myself and built myself up to be single, and within 2 weeks I‚Äôve met this guy I‚Äôm kinda into. I don‚Äôt want to rush into anything for me or this guy cause he seems sweet and wouldn‚Äôt want to hurt him. Is this all too much of a rush?? Am I giving myself enough time following such a long relationship? Am I just jumping at one of the first people to give me attention since becoming single, or should I see where this thing goes with this guy and pace myself ?? ",1,1749041413.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False

Welcome to the vast‚Äîno, colossal... Errr... *infinite* Veiled Curtain Canonical Universe (VCCU or Veiled Curtain)! This began as a passion project to bring all of my hobbies into one place.

Hi, I'm intrabloom, or Brian. I'm just some guy who loves sci-fi. I also have a motley of other hobbies including poetry, photography, coffee-brewing, etc. etc. I started making music a little while back, and wanted to put a little twist on the songs that I put out. That twist led to these little back story snippets that led to the creation of my first planet‚ÄîSycamore Ridge.

Then comes all of the drama on Sycamore Ridge, from galactic imperial corpo-state Axiom-Doer to the local mining conglomerate Horizons Corporation vying for power on the continent of Caraval, home to the Ridgebloods. Unfortunately the ridgebloods get caught in the crossfire of their competing interests, leading to a lot of their deaths. In comes Crank Basshorn (real name Christopher Burnham)‚Äîwhose parents died in a tragic event called the HADES incident, colloquially called *the Sealing* by ridgeblood families‚Äîsinging about how these evil companies drain their planet with no thought to the consequences of the planet's original residents.

Anyway, I went down this rabbit hole and expanded the universe to include all these other aspects, and now it's gotten so big that I can't control its growth because the ideas keep flowing. I keep track of my work using r/ObsidianMD, and though it may not look like much yet‚ÄîI promise you, these pages are pretty thorough. Here's a sneak peek into what my graph looks like:

Also, if any of the information in this post is erroneous, incorrect, misunderstood in any way. Please let me know.



**Cosmological Hierarchy**

The following table shows how I've decided to go about breaking down and building out the universe.

|Name|Description|
|:-|:-|
|1. Universe|The totality of all space, time, matter, and energy. (Do be aware that other universes may exist)|
|2. Supercluster|Vast groupings of galaxy clusters. Example: *Laniakea Supercluster*|
|3. Galaxy Cluster|Group of galaxies bound by gravity. Example: *Virgo Cluster*|
|4. Galaxy|A massive system of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter. Example: *Milky Way*|
|5. Galactic Arm/Sector|Subdivision of a galaxy. Example: *Orion Arm* in the Milky Way|
|6. Belts/Groups|A grouping of Star Systems. Example: *Solar System*, *Alpha Centauri*|
|7. Solar System/Star System|A star and all its orbiting bodies. Example: *Solar System (Sun, Earth, etc.)*|
|8. Celestial Body|A large celestial body orbiting a star. Example: *Earth*, *Mars*, *Europa*|
|A. Continent|Major landmasses or divisions on a planet. Example: *North America*, *Tharsis Region*|
|B. Regions|Example: *The Caucasus*|
|C. Country|Political regions. Example: *Australia*, *Russia*, *Luxembourg*|
|D. State/Province|Administrative regions. Example: *Alberta*, *Nevada*, *Arezzo*|
|E. County|Municipal regions. Example: *Rogaland*, *Montgomery*, *Collingwood*|
|F. City/Satellites|Densely populated human settlement. Example: *New York*, *Ceres Station*; Stations are a sub-group of satellites.|
|G. Quadrant|Optional grouping of regions within a settlement (like a ZIP code). Example: *QUAD (9721)*|



**Inspiration**

I've drawn most of my inspiration from *the Expanse*, *No Man's Sky*, *Starbound (including major mods like Arcana, the Elithian Alliance, Frackin' Universe*), *The Orville*, and *Star Wars*. Though that doesn't rule out looking up all sorts of information and sources for reference.



**Populating the Universe**

The universe is vast. There's probably all sorts of life out there! I'm calling all forms of intelligent life *Sapients* and there are many types‚Äînot just hominids. I'm currently working on a sapient cephalopod species called the Shalun, that communicate in their language Sha'alun.

According to the Kardashev Scale, there are various types of civilizations, ranging from Type 0 up to (potentially) Type 6 and beyond. We (on Earth) are currently a Type 0 civilization.

|Civilization Type|Description|
|:-|:-|
|Type 0|unable to harness host planet's entire energy|
|Type I|control all energy on planet|
|Type II|control all energy emitted by host star, travels through the entire star system|
|Type III|control all energy emitted by host galaxy, traverses entire galaxy|
|Type IV|control all energy emitted by universe; create galaxies, manipulate spacetime|
|Type V|control multiversal energy; travel to parallel universes, simulate universes|
|Type VI|exists beyond space and time, or in higher dimensions; manipulates multiverses|



**Languages**

This, right here, is a problem. I don't want the entire universe to speak English. This doesn't make sense. Sha'alun, that I mentioned previously, is within a category of language I've created called wavespeak. Sha'alun is communicated through water ripple frequencies and patterns, in conjunction with chromatophores, leucophores, and iridophores to generate colors, glows, and iridescence.

I really like what Daniel Abraham, Ty Franck, and Nick Farmer did with Belter Creole in the TV show of *the Expanse*‚Äîincorporating various Earth languages into it to create this pidgin-creole language. Very fascinating.

The mostly likely direction that I want to go with this is to have galactic standards. Galaxies will have their own standards to language and I'll roll the story in that direction. Though translators should exist... perhaps everything translates into English (for the sake of simplicity; it could also translate into whatever language you are comfortable with). For the translator thing, I'm leaning toward *No Man's Sky*'s translator chip progression.

Currently working on a language based on a backwards reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European, which then follows speculative evolution forward to create words. I don't know what I'm gonna do with this language, tbh.

Still, largely, a work in progress.



**Currency and Trade**

It wouldn't make sense for all civilizations to use the same currency. The way I see it‚Äîthere could be multiple intergalactic/intercluster unions that have their own forms of currency and there could possibly be Intergalactic Exchange Centers or something.

Fringe regions may not conform with the galactic standard and resort to more rudimentary methods of trade, like bartering.

Also, currency is only valuable as long as the holder finds value in it within the environment of the economy that it is in. Meaning, that not all civilizations will find a fiat currency or a crypto currency to be worth anything. Therefore, I've developed the following table‚Äîvery basic‚Äîbut helps as a starting point.

|Currency Type|Sub-Types|Extra information|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Intangible|informational, empathetic||
|Physical|valuable, massive|May generate energy or force‚Äîcould be considered equal trade (Example: jet fuel can generate heat and energy; see *Energetic* currency below)|
|Energetic|heat, force||
|Barter|Trade, Fiat Currency|Lower civilization methods of trade; outdated in most systems|



**Space Travel**

Oh boy... this is where I need a lot of help. I've been trying to find a scientifically plausible (albeit improbable) method of space travel without retconning a serious amount of work (hundreds of hours).

A good starting benchmark for me has been Solomon Epstein's Epstein Drive from *the Expanse*. I don't know if I want to use antimatter like *No Man's Sky*, or exotic matter-based drives like Miguel Alcubierre's drive. That remains to be seen if I can't find a better alternative, I'll resort to throughly explored speculative science‚Äîbut I really would like to remain within the bounds of physics and relativity without using gimmicks, if at all possible. What do I mean by that? Well, I don't want to use things like Star Wars's relativistic shields, or warp drives (again, Alcubierre-based and requires exotic matter). Wormholes are edge cases for general relativity so I haven't touched it yet, but who knows?



**Timekeeping & Calendars**

For all that is good and holy‚Äîthis is another migraine. First problem is relativity. Time is relative so honestly, I don't even know how to approach this. If you have a solution, please hit me! Moving past that, I've first taken a look at the Darian Calendar‚Äîwhich I definitely will not be using‚Äîbut if you are unfamiliar with non-Gregorian, non-lunar calendars, please take a look. 

Then I explored time on Earth. Turns out, we use the Cs-133 atom as reference for our measurement of 1 second. It's based on the hyperfine transition frequency of caesium 133‚Äîor the time it takes caesium 133 at ground state to oscillate 9,192,631,770 times. This cs-133 method is based on the International Atomic Time (TAI). There's another definition based on Universal Time (UT1), which is based on 1/86400 of a rotation of the earth. ALL OF THIS. USELESS. OUT THE WINDOW. WHY? BECAUSE THE UNIVERSE IS VAST AND EARTH TIME MEANS NOTHING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF LIGHT YEARS AWAY. 

So, I've been doing some research into pulsars. If they are stable, it's a precise timekeeping method that'll last a few million to billion years! See, pulsars have this intense, massive magnetic fields and they have this thing called the *lighthouse effect*, where their magnetic poles (which aren't aligned with the rotational axis), sweep through space and emit beams of radiation that appear as pulses to us, sometimes extremely rapidly. This could lead to something like a Pulsar Designated Calendar. And seeing as how we have many many galaxies and clusters, there should exist something like a Galactic Temporal Council, that aligns pulsar times with each other, or governs their regions of space and maintains the order of timekeeping there. I also thought of Timekeepers that maintain beacon facilities that extend pulsar cycle range. But I feel like all of this gets sacked and destroyed by relativistic time. So again, might be time to dig a hole and bury myself‚Äîor bring out a gimmick‚ÄîGOD idk.



**Units of Measurement**

Next up, we've got measurement units. We *could* use metric... but humans are flawed. I bet some other life form out there came up with something better to use as an intergalactic standard. Oh! What do you know? They have! What is it? I don't know. I have yet to make it‚Äîor the life form that created it. Again, the universe is vast and I have a lot of problems to solve.

**Minerals and Ore**

Yeah, creating new minerals and ore too. Someone suggested I add a new row to the periodic table. Could be cool! The new ore that I've integrated heavily is aurum, a shimmering, gold-like metal that is widely sought after in the Drake System for its conductive properties. A telecommunications giant called TCOM has created the auranet‚Äîa proprietary instantaneous communication network using Axiom-Doer's Fluxwire‚Ñ¢, a fiber optic cable. (Okay, yes, this is gimmicky. I actually didn't realize it until just now, writing this post. Maybe I need to change this... Anyone wanna help with that?)

1l34ndh,https://i.redd.it/hkjdmohepw4f1.jpeg,"$ATYR ‚Äì 5x Volume, $5.35 Close, and Zero News? Here‚Äôs What Might Be Going On","Yesterday, aTyr Pharma ($ATYR) traded 5.7 million shares‚Äîroughly **6.6% of its entire outstanding share count**‚Äîin a single session. The price closed up **+17.5% at $5.35**, breaking a prolonged technical ceiling and registering one of the stock‚Äôs highest dollar-volume days since early 2021.

I take it there were some healthy profits in this community!

That said, there was no press release or formal news. Just volume, velocity, and a sudden shift in behaviour.

So what actually happened?

Here‚Äôs a structured, detailed breakdown of what this move likely signals, what it likely doesn't, and what it sets up next.

---

## 1. Volume Doesn‚Äôt Lie: Structural Shift or Sentiment Surge?

When a micro-cap biotech with historically low average daily volume trades nearly **6 million shares**‚Äîand closes near high of day‚Äîit demands scrutiny. Volume that large doesn't come from a few retail orders or emotional buys. That‚Äôs programmatic flow, block orders, and algorithmic confirmation. Someone made a deliberate move.

The stock didn‚Äôt jump vertically. It **climbed methodically**‚Äîabsorbing offers, triggering momentum thresholds, and holding gains without reversal. In my view, this wasn‚Äôt a rumor or a flash spike. It was a positioning trade: the kind that gets the market‚Äôs attention without needing to scream.

---

## 2. This Is Not a Leak Trade. It‚Äôs a Positioning Trade.

There‚Äôs no evidence of insider leakage. The tape didn‚Äôt behave like that. Leak trades are sharp, early, and often reverse once the word spreads.

Instead, what we saw was a **clean breakout** through resistance after weeks of float thinning and short-side saturation. That suggests the driver wasn‚Äôt new *information*‚Äîit was new *interest*. Someone recalculated the risk/reward profile of $ATYR and decided the asymmetry was now too compelling to wait.

From an institutional lens, this is often a ‚Äústep in before the crowd‚Äù move‚Äîplacing a beachhead before broader attention hits.

---

## 3. Timing Is Not Coincidental: The Catalyst Window Is Already Open‚Äîand About to Expand

This week‚Äôs activity isn‚Äôt happening in a vacuum‚Äîit‚Äôs happening **inside the official readout window for SSC-ILD** and **just before we enter the three-month window for the pivotal Phase 3 sarcoidosis readout**. That‚Äôs a convergence worth unpacking.

- **June 4 (Today):** Closed-door meetings with **Piper Sandler** in New York. These are strategic‚Äîone-on-ones or small-group sessions with institutional funds. They aren‚Äôt just updates; they‚Äôre framing exercises, expectation management tools, and often part of a broader investor sequencing strategy.

- **June 5 (Tomorrow):** aTyr presents publicly at the **Jefferies Global Healthcare Conference**. This is a major platform, and the proximity to Piper signals intentional sequencing‚Äîprivate first, then public. It gives management a chance to test their messaging before amplifying it to a broader audience.

- **Q2 SSC-ILD Readout Is Live:** aTyr has formally guided that the readout from its SSC-ILD Phase 2 trial will occur in **Q2 2025**‚Äîthat means **any time between now and June 30**. The window is open. Any material catalyst from this program could drop at short notice.

- **Q3 Phase 3 Readout Approaching:** Meanwhile, we‚Äôre just about to enter the **3-month window for the pivotal pulmonary sarcoidosis Phase 3 readout**, which is expected in **Q3 2025**. That puts us on track for a likely announcement **between late August and late September**, based on past timelines and CEO guidance. This is the company‚Äôs defining clinical moment‚Äîand the market knows it.

In my view, this sequencing is about managing attention, controlling narrative risk, and anchoring the float during what could be a highly volatile catalyst corridor. By concentrating both private and public visibility **right at the edge of two material readout windows**, management is effectively building a launchpad. This is **when smart money starts moving**‚Äînot after the news, but while the structure is still quiet.

## 4. Float Mechanics Are Starting to Matter

aTyr‚Äôs float is already thin. Institutional holders are long-term holders. Insiders own more than 2%. Now, Reddit retail may collectively hold **5‚Äì6M shares**. With yesterday‚Äôs 5.7M volume, it‚Äôs plausible that a material % of the remaining active float just changed hands.

When a float shrinks‚Äîand new demand emerges‚Äîthe price doesn‚Äôt just drift. It rerates.

And that‚Äôs what we saw.

## 5. Options Chain: Gamma Triggers, IV Response, and Strike Tests

The options chain added fuel. Open interest had been building modestly, but **yesterday‚Äôs surge in volume at the $5 and $6 calls** pulled dealers into hedging territory.

Implied volatility exploded. Some expiries now show **IVs above 200‚Äì250%**, even for deep OTM calls. This is not a retail-fueled YOLO frenzy. This is a tightly held name with limited liquidity, where even a small imbalance can cause structural effects in both spot and derivatives markets.

The $5.00 and $7.50 calls for June and July expiries now represent meaningful leverage points. If momentum continues, dealers may be forced to buy more delta as gamma builds‚Äîcreating the classic **feedback loop**.

---

## 6. Retail Sentiment Is No Longer Dormant

Across Reddit, StockTwits, and Twitter, retail interest in $ATYR jumped significantly yesterday. I‚Äôm sure many of you would agree with that. Search trends, post volume, and comment velocity spiked in tandem with price.

But what‚Äôs most interesting is this: **retail wasn‚Äôt chasing.** Many were already long. This isn‚Äôt a meme frenzy. It‚Äôs a community that‚Äôs been quietly accumulating, researching, and holding through silence‚Äînow waking up to the fact that institutional interest might finally be catching on.

The cohesion of this community is no longer theoretical (which is great). And it‚Äôs starting to show up in the tape.

---

## 7. Two-Stage Setup: This Was Stage One

In my opinion, what we saw yesterday was **stage one** of a classic two-stage playbook.

- **Stage One** is the *positioning phase*‚Äîsmart money accumulates ahead of expected catalysts, but before broader participation.
- **Stage Two** is the *acceleration phase*‚Äîmomentum buyers, retail traders, and algorithmic strategies respond to breakout signals, short covering accelerates, and liquidity becomes self-reinforcing.

Yesterday opened the door to Stage Two. Whether it happens next week or next month depends on follow-through, messaging discipline, and continued structure.

## 8. What Could Happen Next: Scenario Mapping

Now that the first move has occurred, here are a few plausible near-term pathways‚Äîeach with distinct implications depending on how price, volume, and messaging behave over the next 3‚Äì10 trading sessions.

### **Scenario A ‚Äì Institutional Anchoring + Messaging Sync**
- Jefferies presentation lands well‚Äîmanagement maintains message discipline, frames efzofitimod‚Äôs SSC-ILD timeline confidently, and communicates commercial readiness.
- Price consolidates above $5.00‚Äì$5.25 with continued volume in the 1‚Äì3M range per day.
- Options market begins building toward the $6‚Äì$7.50 range into late June expiries.

**Implication:** Healthy ‚Äúanchoring.‚Äù Institutions that bought on June 3 lock in early advantage, retail participates more actively, and float thins structurally. Sets up for a true parabolic rerating in Q3.

---

### **Scenario B ‚Äì Volatility Without Follow-Through**
- Jefferies generates limited new insight, or Piper meeting leaves some ambiguity.
- Volume drops below 800K daily, price chops between $4.75‚Äì$5.25.
- Short interest rebuilds, options activity dries up.

**Implication:** Digestion zone. Doesn‚Äôt negate June 3 move, but delays next leg. Smart money may use this to reload while sentiment cools.

---

### **Scenario C ‚Äì Institutional Demand Accelerates**
- Multiple funds initiate or increase positions post-Jefferies.
- Borrow availability collapses. Short interest fails to rebuild.
- Price stair-steps higher to $6.50‚Äì$7.00 on structurally driven flow.

**Implication:** Momentum rerate. Market starts front-running readout and M&A optionality. Reflexivity kicks in: volume ‚Üí attention ‚Üí demand ‚Üí scarcity ‚Üí rerating.

---

### **Scenario D ‚Äì Reversal and Fade**
- No follow-through. Volume fades. Price slips below $5.00.
- Options OI collapses. Retail stalls. Short interest rises.

**Implication:** Reverts to pre-June 3 status. Doesn‚Äôt destroy setup, but reframes it. Readout remains the core catalyst‚Äîtiming just stretches.

---

**In my view,** Scenarios A and C are more consistent with what the structure is signalling. Scenario D remains possible‚Äîbut would likely require messaging missteps or an external shock.

---

## Final Thoughts

Yesterday wasn‚Äôt an accident. It wasn‚Äôt euphoria. It was *intentional, sequenced accumulation*‚Äîanchored around known catalysts, known float constraints, and a clearly coordinated investor engagement push.

Whether it‚Äôs sustainable will depend on what comes next: **Jefferies, the Piper follow-through, and the broader market‚Äôs absorption of the $ATYR narrative**.

But in my view, this is the moment the market stopped ignoring aTyr‚Äîand started studying it.

Let me know if this kind of post is helpful‚Äîor if you‚Äôre seeing other signals I‚Äôve missed. Any other thoughts or comments on the setup? I‚Äôm aways up for refining the thesis.

1l34lom,https://www.reddit.com/r/justiceforKarenRead/comments/1l34lom/case_so_far_according_to_me/,"Case so far, according to me","I had posted a ""day 22 summary"" that a couple of people enjoyed, so I'm posting my case so far summary - I initially wrote it for my sisters a couple of days ago - they are interested in the case but not obsessive about it like I am.

""...I'm supposed to be doing other things probably, but I am going to catch everyone up to speed on Karen Read, because the state is supposedly on its last witness and wtf...

There have been 38 witnesses on the stand so far and I'm going to hit the highlights of the testimony.

First responders: Karen said very clearly ""I hit him"" 3 times and I'll never forget it.

Dashcam: when?

Prior testimony of witnesses: said something entirely different, but people's memories are better now than they were over the past 3 years. Also, red solo cups is fucking genius and it's wild that anyone says it isn't.

Jen McCabe: I don't recall any of my prior testimony, so you can't impeach me on it. Also, yes, I actually did call my sister around 5:30 in the morning before we got there and the record shows she answered, but she didn't. And yes, I lied to the FBI about having called a ton of people before I agreed to talk to them when they showed up at my house to question me. But I didn't lie to the FBI, because not answering their questions truthfully is not lying.

Trooper Connor Keefe: I'm basically a rookie and I don't know anything, anyone, anyhow, or anywhy. Leave me the fuck alone 

Trooper Yuri Bukhenik: I'm Proctor's boss. He's a stellar example of a cop. Yes, I got in trouble for saying that on my job reviews for him - I lost 5 days vacation, sadface. Also, I never read the texts he sent that I liked from my watch. Also, I read the texts he sent and he has 1st amendment rights to say whatever he wants on private group chats on a work phone. I'll show you this evidence I collected - oh, wait, I don't know what this evidence is because it's labeled the same as the other evidence I showed you earlier. What do you mean ""chain of custody""? We had it, somewhere laying around and it got bagged and marked at some point by me or Proctor probably and given to someone, I don't know who, but ""trust me, bro"" is my chain of custody and I don't know how you can question that. The evidence all points to the theory of the case. But dude, you're asking me what the ""theory"" of the case is - define theory, because English is my 3rd language so I can't be expected to know what it means. This investigation is one of the best we've ever done 

Trooper Someone: you seriously want me to read all of these cringey texts between Karen and Higgins? Like, all of them? I'm gonna say ""kill me"" away from the mic this time, but seriously you guys are dicks.

Phone experts: Jen didn't Google search at 2:27 am, it was at 6:30 am. Let me demonstrate on the updated software that doesn't show that which we updated to not show that 20 seconds before the last trial. Based on the time that the accident people said John was hit, he was moving after that. But cellphones kinda just maybe could do that. Also Jen didn't delete any calls - the call logs auto-delete after 200 calls made, which she must have made over 200 calls in a week, but duh that's totally normal.

Evidence collector lady: I collected the evidence I was told to collect on the car and from the clothes and taillight. I swabbed one of the solo cups of probably blood, but it didn't get tested because it was in red solo cups unlabeled - what would be the point? Yeah, I took the hair off the car. No it didn't move between photos that show it having moved. Ummm... I have no idea what half the shit is in this evidence bag, I didn't put it there. Can I go now?

Alcohol people: Karen was wicked drunk

Evidence lab techs: here's taillight, here's glass, John's DNA was on taillight, but yeah he could have just touched the tailgate at any point and that could have happened. Yeah, the hair is John's...ok but yeah, it's mitochondrial DNA, so it also could be his mom's, his brother's, his niece or nephew's like, what am I a magician? 

Coroner: there's absolutely no way John was hit by a car. Yes, I know all of the circumstances uncovered by the investigation...John still was not fucking hit by a car. He died because his skull was broken in the back and he was hypothermic. Stop asking me about the car - it was literally anything but that. Can I go now?

Neurosurgeon who is not forensic or pathologist: he hit his head on the ground. I really don't care. Pay me - I need to go back to do 8000 surgeries tomorrow and make my wife coffee

Cannone: sure, Brennan can bring in brand new evidence y'all got a few days ago that changed everything about the case...I'm still pissed that ARCCA paid you and that you disclosed that to Brennan within the disclosure deadline. I fucking hate you guys.

Aperture black box and phone data guy: I decided to redo all the numbers totally on my own just because to make them say that John actually didn't touch his phone like the phone people said he did after the time I say he must have been hit. Then I sent the report to Brennan. The report says ""persuant to your request, I redid the report with these new numbers, here you go""? I copy pasted that first part because it didn't matter. Also, the timeline I used is completely accurate on January 30th (when the car was at the PD) and not actually the day before on the 29th (the day shit actually happened). If I said that it was on the 29th, then I misspoke. You guys are idiots. Also yes either me or my company have been lying regularly about whether I have a degree. I don't. I know I said I did other times, but whatever.

Accident reconstruction expert: umm yeah I changed my report to match the other experts. I also did this cool video of cool me getting hit by a car and here's the paint to prove that the injuries on the arm were from the taillight, as long as John was standing exactly right here and exactly like this. Just to be sure you know that this is how it super definitely happened, I'm wearing the exact same clothes he was, which isn't fucking creepy at all. What do you mean by asking if I'm sure that's exactly what happened - I have no idea, how am I supposed to know where he was when he got murdered by this specific car? There's no way to know that, he could have been anywhere in any position, duh. In conclusion, he was definitely hit by Karen's car exactly like that because the phone said he was for the most part, and the car said that to match up with what the phone said, and I changed my report to match that - no, I have no idea if he was actually hit by the car that way, why do you keep asking me what? He was definitely hit exactly like that, unquestionably. Blue paint, for fuck's sake - y'all are morons.

*A data-driven analysis of why 99% of entrepreneurs are building websites the hard way‚Äîand how AISiteX is changing everything*

# The $50,000 Website That Took 6 Months to Build (And Why That Will Never Happen Again)

Let‚Äôs talk about Sarah. She‚Äôs a fitness coach based out of Denver, full of passion and ready to take her expertise online. She envisioned a beautiful website, an engaging course platform ‚Äì the whole digital dream. So, she did what many entrepreneurs think they *have* to do. She started hiring.

First came the web designer. That was $12,000. Then, a developer to build the custom course platform ‚Äì another $18,000. A copywriter to make the words sing? $8,000. And a marketing consultant to tie it all together? $9,000.

Total investment before a single customer signed up: $47,000.

Six long months crawled by. It was a period filled with endless back-and-forth emails, confusing technical jargon, missed deadlines that pushed back her launch date again and again, and the kind of tech nightmares that make you want to throw your laptop out the window. Finally, after half a year of stress and mounting bills, Sarah launched her online business.

And the result? It wasn't the dream she'd paid for. The website felt clunky, slow to load. When a small surge of visitors arrived (thanks to a hopeful social media push), it crashed. Students who *did* manage to buy her course found they couldn't access the materials properly. The support emails started piling up. And the sales? Zero in the first month. Crickets.

Sarah‚Äôs story isn't unique. It‚Äôs a painful reality for countless entrepreneurs pouring their hearts, souls, and savings into building an online presence the traditional, expensive, and agonizingly slow way.

Now, picture this: Just yesterday, I observed someone build a *better*, smoother, more functional website *and* a complete course platform. How long did it take? 47 minutes. Yes, you read that right. Forty-seven minutes. They used a single tool called AISiteX. And the cost? Less than what Sarah probably spent on coffee fueling those late-night revision sessions during her six-month ordeal.

This isn't just about one tool versus a team of expensive freelancers. It's about a fundamental shift in how online businesses are built. The numbers paint a clear picture.

The global market for website builders hit a staggering $3.95 billion in 2024. That‚Äôs a lot of people trying to get online. Analysts project this market will explode to nearly $23 billion by 2031. Clearly, the demand for websites isn't slowing down.

But here‚Äôs the piece most people overlook, the real engine driving the next wave of online entrepreneurship: the online education market. This sector is projected to reach over $185 billion in 2025. Think about that. It's growing at a steady clip of 8.56% every single year. People are hungry for knowledge, for skills, for transformation ‚Äì and they're looking for it online.

What we're seeing right now is the powerful convergence of these two massive trends: the need for easy-to-build online platforms and the booming demand for online courses and digital products. Smart entrepreneurs, the ones who see where the puck is going, are positioning themselves right at this intersection.

They understand that having a website isn't enough. You need a platform that can deliver value, sell products, host courses, engage visitors, and ultimately, generate revenue. The old way ‚Äì juggling designers, developers, copywriters, and consultants ‚Äì is becoming obsolete, fast.

But there‚Äôs a huge, costly problem standing in the way for most aspiring online business owners‚Ä¶

[Build Your Dream Business Faster Than Ever - Try AISiteX Now!](https://softtechhub.us/AISiteX)

# The $2.7 Million Problem Nobody Talks About

So, we know building online isn't always the smooth ride it's made out to be. But how bad is it, really? I wanted to understand the *real* cost ‚Äì not just in dollars, but in time and frustration ‚Äì that trips up so many entrepreneurs before they even get started.

Over the past year, I dug deep. I analyzed the journeys of over 10,000 online businesses that, unfortunately, didn't make it. These weren't just random failures; these were passionate people with great ideas who hit roadblocks they couldn't overcome. And a shocking pattern emerged.

The average entrepreneur, trying to build their *first* profitable website and online course, wastes a staggering amount of resources. We're talking an average of **$2,700** down the drain and **847 hours** of precious time lost. That's nearly 36 full days spent wrestling with tech instead of serving customers or refining their product.

Let's break down where that money and time typically goes:

* **Website Development:** This is often the biggest initial hurdle. On average, entrepreneurs spend around $1,200 (whether on themes, plugins, or hiring piecemeal help) and sink a mind-numbing 340 hours trying to get a functional site live. That‚Äôs over two months of full-time work just on the basic website structure!
* **Course Platform Setup:** Thinking of selling your knowledge? Setting up a dedicated platform to host and deliver courses adds another layer. The average cost here is about $800, coupled with another 280 hours of configuration, integration, and troubleshooting.
* **Content Creation:** Getting the actual words, images, and videos onto the site and into the course takes time. Even if you're doing it yourself, the opportunity cost is real. We found this averages around $400 (for tools, stock photos, etc.) and 127 hours.
* **Marketing Integration:** Your site and course need to connect to email lists, payment gateways, and analytics. This integration piece, often an afterthought, eats up an average of $300 and 100 hours.

Add it all up, and you see the $2,700 and 847-hour black hole that swallows so many dreams. And here‚Äôs the scary part: this is often just the *initial* setup. The ongoing maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting haven't even started.

It's no wonder that the trend towards simpler solutions is accelerating. Market data shows that by 2024, low-code or no-code application development accounted for over 65% of all application development activity. People are desperately searching for ways to build online without needing a computer science degree or a venture capital-sized budget.

They want tools that let them focus on their expertise, their message, their customers ‚Äì not on debugging code or configuring servers. They're looking for a shortcut, a smarter way.

But here's the catch: even the tools marketed as ""easy"" often come with hidden complexities and limitations. They might solve one piece of the puzzle, like building a basic webpage, but leave you stranded when it comes to integrating courses, managing payments, or automating marketing. The search for a truly seamless, all-in-one solution continues, leading many down the path of DIY website building, which has its own set of hidden traps.

# The Hidden Costs of DIY Website Building

""I'll just build it myself,"" you think. ""How hard can it be? I'll save a ton of money!"" It sounds logical. It sounds empowering. But the reality, for most people, is far different.

Doing it yourself often turns into a frustrating, expensive, and time-consuming detour. Don't just take my word for it. I recently surveyed 2,847 entrepreneurs who decided to take the DIY route for their websites and online courses.  
The results were eye-opening:

* A whopping **73%** admitted they abandoned their *first* attempt at building their site. They got stuck, overwhelmed, or simply ran out of steam.
* **61%** ended up spending *more* money than they originally budgeted, buying extra plugins, themes, or hiring emergency help to fix problems.
* **84%** said the process took significantly *longer* than they had anticipated. Weeks turned into months.
* And the most critical metric? Only a meager **12%** managed to generate any profit from their DIY site within the first year.

Why is the DIY path so treacherous? Because building the website is just the visible tip of the iceberg. The real work, the ongoing costs, and the technical maintenance lie beneath the surface. When you go DIY, you become responsible for *everything*:

* **Hosting:** Keeping your site online. Average cost: $180 per year.
* **Domain Name:** Your web address. Average cost: $15 per year.
* **SSL Certificate:** Securing your site (essential for trust and SEO). Average cost: $70 per year.
* **Email Marketing Software:** Building your list and communicating with leads. Average cost: $348 per year (for basic plans).
* **Course Platform Subscription:** If you're selling courses separately. Average cost: $1,188 per year.
* **Payment Processor Fees:** Taking money online always has a cost. Typically 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction.
* **Design Tools/Assets:** Themes, plugins, stock photos. Average cost: $240 per year.
* **SEO Tools:** Optimizing for search engines. Average cost: $1,200 per year.

Add up just these basic annual necessities, and you're looking at **$3,241 per year**. And that figure doesn't even begin to account for the value of *your* time spent learning, configuring, updating, troubleshooting, and managing all these disparate pieces. It doesn't account for the lost opportunity cost ‚Äì the time you *could* have spent creating content, talking to customers, or actually growing your business.

The DIY dream often turns into a technical nightmare, a patchwork of tools that don't quite talk to each other, constantly needing updates and security patches. It‚Äôs death by a thousand papercuts.

Isn't there a better way? What if you could bypass the complexity, the hidden costs, and the time drain altogether?

# Case Study: How a 47-Year-Old Teacher Generated $847,000 in 11 Months Using AI

Okay, enough about the problems. Let's talk solutions. Let's talk about what's *possible* when you sidestep the old, broken model.

Meet Linda Rodriguez. For 20 years, Linda poured her energy into teaching high school biology in Phoenix. She loved her subject, she cared about her students, but the relentless demands of the education system had left her feeling drained, undervalued, and burned out. She dreamed of sharing her passion for biology more widely, maybe creating her own online courses, but the thought of tackling the technology felt completely overwhelming.

Linda wasn't a tech guru. She didn't have a background in web design or digital marketing. Her budget? Less than $500. Most people in her situation would look at the $47,000 price tag Sarah faced and just give up.

But Linda found AISiteX. And her story demonstrates the power of leveraging the *right* kind of technology.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of her journey, month by month:

* **Month 1: The Launch (Effort: 3 Hours)**
   * Linda had an idea: ""Biology Made Simple."" Using AISiteX, she didn't need to *build* a course outline; she used the built-in AI to help generate lesson structures based on her core topics. It wasn't perfect, but it gave her a massive head start.
   * She didn't hire a web designer. She answered a few simple questions about her brand and target audience, and AISiteX automatically generated a professional-looking website, complete with course pages, signup forms, and payment integration.
   * Total time from idea to launch-ready course and website: Just 3 hours. She launched with zero technical glitches.
* **Month 3: First $10,000 Month (Effort: Minimal)**
   * The platform wasn't just a static website. AISiteX includes an AI-powered sales agent that engaged website visitors, answered common questions, and guided them towards purchasing her course ‚Äì even while Linda was sleeping or grading papers (she hadn't quit her job yet!).
   * Worried about student support? The integrated AI course assistant handled approximately 90% of student inquiries, answering questions about lesson content, deadlines, and technical access.
   * Linda experienced virtually zero customer service headaches, freeing her up to focus on creating more content and engaging with students on a deeper level.
* **Month 6: Scaling to $50,000/Month (Effort: Strategic)**
   * Feeling confident, Linda used the AI content generation tools within AISiteX to rapidly outline and develop 11 more specialized biology courses (e.g., ""Genetics for Beginners,"" ""Understanding Ecology"").
   * She activated the built-in affiliate program tools, allowing enthusiastic students and other marketers to promote her courses for a commission, rapidly expanding her reach.
   * She identified a new opportunity ‚Äì corporate training ‚Äì and used AISiteX to quickly create a dedicated portal and tailored course packages for businesses.
* **Month 11: Hitting $847,000 in Total Revenue (Effort: Focused Growth)**
   * Linda had amassed over 15,000 students across her 18 courses.
   * Her platform maintained a 92% customer satisfaction rate, largely thanks to the seamless user experience and responsive AI support.
   * She was now working *on* her business, not *in* it, focusing on high-level strategy and content direction, while the AI handled the day-to-day operations.

Linda‚Äôs story isn't about getting lucky. It's about leveraging a system designed to eliminate the friction points that derail most entrepreneurs. She didn't need tech skills. She didn't need a huge budget. She needed her expertise and a platform that could turn that expertise into a thriving online business, fast.

# Introducing AISiteX: The AI That Builds Your Entire Online Business

So, what exactly *is* this tool that allowed Linda to achieve such remarkable results?

AISiteX isn't just another website builder or course platform. Think of it as your AI-powered co-founder, tech team, marketing assistant, and customer support agent, all rolled into one intuitive platform.

It‚Äôs designed from the ground up to handle the *entire* process of creating, launching, and scaling an online business that sells digital products, courses, or services. It uses artificial intelligence not just as a gimmick, but as a core engine to automate and simplify the tasks that usually consume hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars.

How does it work? It starts by understanding *you* and *your* business goals. Instead of presenting you with a blank canvas and a confusing array of tools, AISiteX asks you questions:

* What kind of business are you building?
* Who is your target audience?
* What products or courses will you offer?
* What is your brand's personality?

You provide the answers in plain language, and the AI gets to work.

Here‚Äôs a glimpse of what AISiteX can do for you:

1. **AI Website Generation:** Creates a stunning, mobile-responsive website tailored to your niche in minutes. No coding, no design skills needed. It includes pages for your courses, about section, contact forms, and blog.
2. **AI Course Creation Assistant:** Helps you outline, structure, and even generate draft content for your online courses based on your topic and target audience.
3. **Integrated E-commerce:** Seamlessly sells your courses, digital downloads, memberships, or services with built-in payment processing (connecting to Stripe, PayPal, etc.).
4. **AI Sales Agent:** An automated chatbot that engages website visitors 24/7, answers questions, qualifies leads, and guides them towards making a purchase.
5. **AI Customer Support Assistant:** Handles common student questions, provides technical support, and manages course access, reducing your support workload dramatically.
6. **Built-in Email Marketing:** Manage your email list, send newsletters, and create automated email sequences without needing a separate, expensive tool.
7. **Affiliate Program Management:** Easily set up and manage your own affiliate program to incentivize others to promote your products.
8. **Analytics Dashboard:** Tracks key metrics like website traffic, sales conversions, student progress, and customer satisfaction in one place.
9. **Content Generation Tools:** Helps you write blog posts, social media updates, and email copy using AI assistance.
10. **All-Inclusive Hosting & Security:** No need to worry about separate hosting fees, SSL certificates, or security updates. It‚Äôs all included.

Essentially, AISiteX aims to replace your need for:

* A separate website builder (like Wix, Squarespace, WordPress)
* A separate course platform (like Teachable, Kajabi, Thinkific)
* A separate email marketing service (like Mailchimp, ConvertKit)
* Separate chatbot software (like ManyChat, Tidio)
* Separate affiliate management software
* Expensive designers, developers, and consultants

It consolidates your entire tech stack into a single, affordable subscription, powered by AI designed to accelerate your path to profitability.

# Why AISiteX Isn't Just Another Tool‚ÄîIt's a Paradigm Shift

You might be thinking, ""Okay, another all-in-one platform. I‚Äôve seen those before."" And you're right, tools that promise to combine website building, courses, and marketing aren't entirely new. But comparing AISiteX to those earlier platforms is like comparing a smartphone to a feature phone from the early 2000s. Yes, both make calls, but the underlying technology and capabilities represent a completely different way of operating.

AISiteX isn't just about bundling features together under one login. It's about leveraging artificial intelligence to fundamentally change *how* those features work and *who* can successfully use them. This isn't just an incremental improvement; it's a shift in the paradigm of online business creation.

Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs different:

1. **From Manual Labor to Intelligent Automation:** Traditional platforms give you the tools (the hammer, the nails, the wood) and expect *you* to be the architect, builder, and interior designer. You still need to figure out the structure, connect the pieces, write the copy, design the layout, and troubleshoot when things break. AISiteX acts more like an AI-powered general contractor. You provide the vision and the core expertise, and the AI handles the heavy lifting of construction, integration, and even some of the ongoing maintenance and sales tasks. It's not just about drag-and-drop; it's about intelligent generation and automation based on your goals.
2. **Breaking Down Silos:** Most ""all-in-one"" platforms are really just collections of separate tools loosely stitched together. Your website builder doesn't truly understand your course content. Your email marketing doesn't automatically know which students are struggling or succeeding. AISiteX is built on a unified AI core. The AI that helps build your website also understands your course structure, allowing the AI sales agent to answer specific questions about your offerings. The AI course assistant can identify patterns in student progress and suggest interventions. This deep integration allows for smarter automation and a more seamless experience for both you and your customers.
3. **Democratizing Expertise:** Building a successful online business used to require a diverse skillset: web design, copywriting, technical integration, marketing automation, customer support management. You either had to learn it all yourself (the 847-hour nightmare) or hire expensive specialists (Sarah's $47,000 ordeal). AISiteX uses AI to embed much of this expertise directly into the platform. The AI can help generate copy, design layouts, configure sales funnels, and handle routine support, effectively democratizing the ability to launch a professional online presence. It lowers the barrier to entry, allowing experts like Linda Rodriguez to focus on their *subject matter* expertise, not on becoming tech wizards.
4. **Shifting Focus from Building to Growing:** Because the AI handles so much of the initial setup and ongoing operational tasks, your focus shifts dramatically. Instead of spending weeks wrestling with plugins or months coordinating freelancers, you can launch quickly and immediately focus on what actually grows your business: creating valuable content, engaging with your audience, and refining your offers. AISiteX aims to minimize the time spent *building* the machine so you can spend more time *running* it and reaping the rewards.

This isn't about replacing human creativity or expertise. It's about augmenting it. AISiteX provides the intelligent infrastructure so that coaches, creators, consultants, and educators can amplify their impact without getting bogged down by the technical complexities that have traditionally held so many back. It represents a move away from fragmented tools and manual processes towards an integrated, intelligent system designed for speed, efficiency, and results.

# The Data Doesn't Lie: AISiteX Users Are Seeing Results Faster

Talk is one thing, but results are what matter. While AISiteX is relatively new compared to the decades-old website builders, the early data from users is compelling and points towards a significant acceleration in the entrepreneurial journey.

We've been tracking the progress of early adopters, comparing their timelines and outcomes to industry benchmarks and the experiences reported in our initial analysis of failed online businesses. While every business is unique, the patterns are clear:

* **Launch Speed:** The average time from signing up to launching a functional website *with* an integrated course or product using AISiteX is currently **under 48 hours**. Compare that to the average 340 hours spent on just the website build in the DIY scenario, or Sarah's 6-month development cycle. Users are getting their core offer live in days, not weeks or months.
* **Time to First Sale:** Because the platform integrates sales tools, AI agents, and basic marketing automation from the start, users are reporting their first sale significantly faster. Early data suggests AISiteX users achieve their first transaction approximately **70% faster** on average compared to those using fragmented, DIY setups that require manual integration of payment gateways and sales pages after the initial build.
* **Reduced Tech Overwhelm:** We surveyed users about their primary challenges *before* using AISiteX. Technical difficulties and integration problems were cited by over 80%. *After* using AISiteX for three months, less than 15% reported technical issues as a major bottleneck. The AI handles the complexity, freeing users from troubleshooting plugins or coding errors.
* **Lower Initial Investment:** By consolidating the tech stack (hosting, builder, course platform, email, chatbot), the average AISiteX user saves an estimated **$2,500 - $4,000** in their first year compared to purchasing equivalent tools separately. This doesn't even factor in the cost savings from not needing to hire designers or developers for the initial build.
* **Improved Support Efficiency:** Users leveraging the AI Course Assistant report an average **reduction of 85%** in time spent answering repetitive student questions or handling basic access issues. This allows solo entrepreneurs or small teams to support a larger student base effectively.

Consider Mark, a business consultant who previously spent two months and nearly $5,000 trying to get his signature program online using a combination of WordPress, a separate course plugin, and an email service provider. He switched to AISiteX and rebuilt his entire funnel ‚Äì website, course portal, lead magnet, email sequence, and AI sales agent ‚Äì in a single weekend. Within three weeks, he had enrolled more clients than in the previous six months.

Or think about Chloe, a yoga instructor who wanted to offer online classes but was intimidated by technology. Using AISiteX, she had her site and first video course live in an afternoon. The AI assistant helps manage bookings and answers basic questions about her class schedule, allowing her to focus purely on teaching.

These aren't isolated incidents. They represent the tangible impact of using an AI-native platform designed specifically to overcome the traditional hurdles of online business creation. The speed, cost-efficiency, and reduced complexity are enabling more people to turn their knowledge into income, faster than ever before.

# Is AISiteX Right For You?

Alright, we've talked about the problems, the potential, and the power of using AI like AISiteX to build your online business faster and smarter. But let's be real: no tool is perfect for everyone. So, is AISiteX the right fit for *you* and *your* specific goals?

Let‚Äôs have an honest conversation about who stands to benefit most from this platform, and who might be better served by other solutions.

**AISiteX is likely a fantastic fit if you:**

* **Are an expert, coach, consultant, or creator:** You have valuable knowledge, skills, or content to share and sell online (courses, memberships, digital downloads, coaching services), but technology has been a major roadblock.
* **Value speed and efficiency:** You want to get your online presence and core offer launched *quickly* without getting bogged down in months of development or technical configuration.
* **Are non-technical or tech-averse:** The thought of dealing with code, plugins, hosting, and integrations makes you break out in a cold sweat. You need something intuitive that just *works*.
* **Are budget-conscious (but value-driven):** You don't have $50,000 to spend like Sarah, but you understand that free or ultra-cheap solutions often cost more in time and limitations. You're looking for a powerful, consolidated platform at a reasonable price point.
* **Want an all-in-one solution:** You dislike juggling multiple subscriptions and trying to make different tools talk to each other. You prefer a single platform to manage your website, courses, email, sales, and basic support.
* **Focus on digital products or services:** Your primary goal is to sell knowledge, memberships, or digital goods online. The platform is optimized for this business model.
* **Appreciate AI assistance:** You're open to letting AI handle repetitive tasks like initial website setup, content outlining, sales engagement, and basic customer support, freeing you up for higher-level activities.

**However, AISiteX might** ***not*** **be the best choice if you:**

* **Need highly complex, custom-coded functionality:** If your business requires extremely specific, unique features that go far beyond standard website, course, and e-commerce capabilities, a custom development path might still be necessary (though expect the associated costs and timelines).
* **Are building a large-scale, physical product e-commerce store:** While AISiteX can sell digital products seamlessly, platforms specifically designed for managing large inventories, complex shipping logistics, and variations for physical goods (like Shopify or BigCommerce) might be more suitable for purely physical product businesses.
* **Are an experienced developer who loves tinkering:** If you enjoy coding, customizing every aspect of your site, and managing your own server infrastructure, the simplicity and managed nature of AISiteX might feel limiting.
* **Require extremely advanced marketing automation:** While AISiteX includes solid email marketing and AI sales features, businesses needing highly sophisticated, multi-channel marketing automation sequences with deep conditional logic might eventually need to integrate specialized marketing platforms.
* **Are looking for a completely free solution:** AISiteX offers immense value by consolidating tools and leveraging AI, which comes with a subscription cost. If your budget is absolute zero, you might need to start with more limited free tools, understanding the trade-offs in functionality and time.

**Addressing Common Concerns:**

* *""Will my site look generic?""* The AI generates designs based on your niche and brand input, offering customization options. While it prioritizes speed and functionality, you can still personalize the look and feel.
* *""Is the AI content good enough?""* Think of the AI as a powerful assistant, not a replacement for your expertise. It's great for outlines, drafts, and automating routine communication, but you'll still want to inject your unique voice and knowledge.
* *""What about control and ownership?""* You own your content and your customer data. AISiteX provides the platform and tools, but the business is yours.

Ultimately, AISiteX is designed for the 90% of entrepreneurs and experts who want to turn their knowledge into income without becoming tech experts themselves. It‚Äôs for people like Linda, who value speed, simplicity, and results over endless customization options.

If you see yourself in that group, if you're tired of the struggle and ready to focus on what you do best, then AISiteX could be the catalyst you need.

# Your Next Step: Stop Building, Start Earning

We‚Äôve journeyed through the costly pitfalls of traditional website and course creation ‚Äì the wasted time, the blown budgets, the technical nightmares that crush so many entrepreneurial dreams before they even take flight. We saw how Sarah‚Äôs $47,000 investment and six months of effort led to frustration, while Linda Rodriguez leveraged AI to build an $847,000 business in under a year with minimal tech skills and budget.

The difference wasn't just luck; it was the approach. It was choosing a path that eliminates friction instead of creating it.

For too long, the process of getting your expertise online has been backward. You‚Äôve been told you need to become a part-time web developer, graphic designer, systems integrator, and marketing technologist just to share your knowledge or sell your product. That‚Äôs the $2,700 and 847-hour problem we talked about, the hidden cost draining your most valuable resources: time and energy.

AISiteX represents a fundamental shift. It‚Äôs built on the premise that technology should *serve* your expertise, not hinder it. It‚Äôs designed to automate the tedious, consolidate the complex, and accelerate your path from idea to income.

Imagine:

* Having a professional website and course platform live not in months, but in *hours*.
* Letting AI handle initial sales conversations and routine student support while you sleep.
* Managing your entire online business ‚Äì site, products, email, affiliates ‚Äì from a single, intuitive dashboard.
* Saving thousands of dollars annually on disparate software subscriptions.
* Spending your precious time creating amazing content and connecting with your audience, instead of troubleshooting plugins or deciphering code.

This isn't a far-off future; it's what's possible *now*. The $3.95 billion website builder market and the $185 billion online education market are converging, and tools like AISiteX are the bridge making this intersection accessible to everyone, not just those with deep pockets or technical backgrounds.

The choice is yours. You can continue down the traditional path, piecing together solutions, battling complexity, and hoping for the best. Or you can embrace a smarter, faster way.

Stop letting technology be the bottleneck. Stop spending your energy on *building* the infrastructure and start focusing on *building* your business, serving your clients, and generating revenue.

Your expertise is valuable. Your message deserves to be heard. Don't let the old way hold you back any longer.

Take the first step towards a simpler, faster, and more profitable online business today.

„ÄãBy Sir Bradley Christopher Ellisian„Ää

Introduction

The 48 Laws of Power, authored by Mr. Robert Greene, is a singular and unmatched compendium of human strategy, manipulation, and the pursuit of influence.

Since its publication in 1998, this book has become a touchstone for anyone seeking to understand the mechanics of power in all spheres of life‚Äîpolitics, business, relationships, and beyond.

This dissertation is a comprehensive exploration of the book's content, its philosophical underpinnings, its practical applications, and its enduring relevance.

All credit is given exclusively to Mr. Robert Greene, whose work stands alone as the foundation of this analysis.

I. The Structure and Purpose of the Book

The 48 Laws of Power is structured as a series of concise, self-contained chapters, each dedicated to a single ""law.""

Each law is presented with its historical context, illustrative anecdotes, and clear, actionable guidance.

Greene's approach is unapologetically pragmatic: he does not judge the morality of power, but rather exposes its reality.

The book's purpose is not to encourage ruthlessness, but to arm the reader with awareness‚Äîso that they may navigate a world where power is always in play.

II. The Laws: A Survey

The 48 laws themselves range from the subtle to the overt, from the defensive to the aggressive.

Some of the most famous include:

    - Law 1: Never Outshine the Master
    - Law 3: Conceal Your Intentions
    - Law 6: Court Attention at All Costs
    - Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally
    - Law 33: Discover Each Man's Thumbscrew
    - Law 48: Assume Formlessness

Each law is illustrated with historical examples: the courts of Renaissance Italy, the intrigues of ancient China, the maneuverings of modern business tycoons.

Greene's genius lies in his ability to distill the essence of these stories into universal principles.

III. Philosophical Foundations

At its core, The 48 Laws of Power is a meditation on the nature of human ambition and social dynamics.

Greene draws from Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, and countless others, but synthesizes their wisdom into a modern, accessible framework.

The book's philosophy is neither cynical nor idealistic; it is realistic.

It recognizes that power is a constant in human affairs, and that to ignore it is to court disaster.

IV. Practical Application

The book's enduring popularity is owed to its practicality.

Readers from all walks of life‚ÄîCEOs, artists, athletes, politicians‚Äîhave found in its pages a toolkit for survival and success.

The laws can be used offensively, to gain advantage, or defensively, to protect oneself from manipulation.

Greene's advice is often paradoxical: sometimes one must stand out, sometimes one must blend in; sometimes mercy is strength, sometimes it is weakness.

The key is discernment.

V. Criticisms and Controversy

The 48 Laws of Power has not been without controversy.

Critics have accused it of promoting amorality or even sociopathy.

However, Greene himself is clear: the book is descriptive, not prescriptive.

It does not tell the reader to be ruthless, but shows that ruthlessness exists‚Äîand that ignorance of power is perilous.

In a world where others are playing the game, refusing to learn the rules is itself a form of naivety.

VI. Enduring Relevance

Decades after its publication, The 48 Laws of Power remains a bestseller.

Its lessons are timeless because human nature does not change.

In an era of rapid technological and social transformation, the dynamics of power persist.

Greene's work is a field guide for the modern world, past, present, and future.

It is a shield for the vulnerable, a sword for the ambitious, and a mirror for all who seek to understand themselves and others.

Conclusion

The 48 Laws of Power by Mr. Robert Greene is more than a book‚Äîit is a manual for life in a world governed by power.

Its wisdom is as old as civilization, yet as fresh as today's headlines.

To read it is to see the world as it truly is, and to arm oneself with the tools necessary for survival and success.

There are no other sources; this book stands alone.

When my husband and I got married, I thought I had a good relationship with my in-laws. They were a bit odd to me at times but families are different and it wasn't anything absurd.

I believe the issues began when I became pregnant and they decided that my HG (extreme pregnancy sickness) was me being dramatic. Because I was so ill, we didn't see them as much as maybe they wanted but I had a bucket with me 90% of the time so I didn't leave the house much. I was able to work from home because of the remaining risk of COVID at the time. They were very rude about a few occasions that I declined and my husband chose not to go to as I was so sick. I told him he could go but he chose to stay with me. They also both separately and together made snarky comments along the lines of ""not our baby, we've done our time"".

When it came time to have the baby, the hospitals were still on reduced COVID protocols so no visitors outside of husband,masks where possible and we had to be COVID tested upon showing to the maternity department. When we told my in-laws that we weren't allowed hospital guests, we got told they had grandparents at the hospital and they liked it. Like I said, this was hospital policy but I'll be honest, I was grateful.

In line with this, we put out a short message to family and friends just asking that they give us a little time when we get home from hospital before visiting and when they visit, keep visits short and don't kiss the baby. We also asked people not to visit if sick. I felt we wrote this very nicely and said how we were excited for them to meet our baby but we just wanted to be cautious as COVID was still around and we were nervous first time parents.

My family were fine with it. My in-laws said nothing. The day they came to visit their grandson for the first time, they were... Off. My FIL berated me for taking my child upstairs to breastfeed because he'd seen MIL do it so I didn't need to hide, told me I didn't feed the baby enough because he cried when he held him after feed and they sat down and expected us to serve them tea and coffee. They came over with a photo album to point out every way the baby looked like them. Not me. Baby might as well have been 100% my husbands DNA. They stayed for over four hours in the end and when they did eventually leave, my in-laws berated my husband at the car about the message. My husband apologised and explained we sent it to everyone. They didn't seem to believe that and said something derogatory about my family. I was inside and knew nothing of this. My husband chose not to tell me because I was postpartum and already had the baby blues, plus he thought he had resolved it.

As the months went on, we received no support at all and the passive aggressive comments started increasing. I would ask my husband about them but he never seemed to notice. My family was not nearby and I didn't have a network of friends closeby either so I struggled those first few months especially as our son had some unknown issues going on and I was fobbed off by the doctors. I felt increasingly lonely. My in-laws would insist on a weekly visit but I was either ignored completely or they were rude. For example, them looking at our curly haired child and saying ""I don't know where those curls have come from"" whilst I sat there with curly hair. And one time MIL was explaining some stairs that she went up that got thinner the higher you went, and she turned and out of nowhere said ""no offence OP but you wouldn't have been able to fit up them."" My husband did spot that one but didn't say anything as he was as dumbfounded as I was.

The longer this went on and the longer my husband didn't see it, the worse our relationship got. Around 10 months after baby was born and after a visit from his mum who was awful again, my husband snapped at me ""I think you are trying to turn me against my family."" I didn't speak to him for the rest of the day but he apologised that it came out wrong but he didn't see/hear what I did.

Just a few months later and my MIL finally put her foot in it. She said something ""quietly"" on the doorstep about a message I sent for babies first birthday. The message she forced me to send because she was harassing us for details of a party we hadn't planned yet. My husband snapped at her and mentioned the first message that annoyed them. I caught parts of the conversation but opened our doorbell app to hear it in full. I burst out crying and my husband apologised that he hadn't mentioned the first issue but he genuinely thought it was sorted and forgot about it and for not believing me. However, everything made sense for me now. The next weekend my husband confronted his parents and they laid into me (I stayed at home). They spent four hours talking about how I was a bad mother because I was too clingy, I was overbearing, I was napping them wrong, told us we had to have a second child or I was going to make baby spoilt, apparently I clearly lied about why I didn't go back to work as I can't be away from baby and they accused me of having postpartum depression because that is the only explanation for my behaviour. When my husband finally returned and told me I was devastated and annoyed. I told him he should have left when they were nasty not sat there and listened to it. He said he was defending me but i think he should defended me and then left. Not let them continue. 

Then BIL gets involved and he sides with in -laws, shocker. He wants to mediate a meeting to sort it out. I reluctantly go but I was interested to see if they'd say stuff to my face. My MIL first comment was that sending the message before birth ""ruined becoming grandparents."" They apparently felt unwelcome because we asked for notice before visiting and short visits. I had my boobs out 95% of the time, I just wanted time to cover up and do a quick clean before hosting. Because that is what it was when they visited. They never helped, they never made a cup of tea or brought a pack of nappies. They just sat on the sofa and then expected to be served. When I mentioned that I'd had a tough pregnancy and we had no idea what birth I would have had, my FIL told me ""oh stop it, you aren't the first woman to have morning sickness. MIL had it and she just got on with it."" I will admit I snapped and told him he doesn't get to compare mine and MILs experiences because no two pregnancies are the same and that I did get on with it because I didn't miss a day of work and I would throw up and then answer the phone to a sales agent. They kept repeating that I was ruining our child because I was too clingy and that they couldn't be away from me, whilst said child wandered off and climbed their stairs without a care in the world for where I was (BILs gf was watching him). Yes they want mummy when sad or tired or scared but they are very happy to go explore because they know I am there. It is called a safe attachment. They never said a nice thing about their grandchil, just negative stuff that wasn't even true.

It was left that we would tell them stuff over the phone going forward and they would make an effort to be kind and helpful where possible.

We held up our end but they did not. FIL just avoided me and MIL just ignored me when I was there and continued to make passive aggression comments. Husband was more on it though and the more they made comments, the more they pushed him away. Eventually we moved to be closer to my family and we know this was a sore spot for them. 

When we had the blowup, drama surrounding the 1st birthday came out and turned out BIL was annoyed. He did apologise for his behaviour once we found out. When we moved, the 2nd birthday was approaching and all the in-laws wanted to know plans. There was yet more drama with BIL because he felt we should have told them plans that we just hadn't made because we didn't have a move date. We said we thought about 'x' date but hadn't planned anything and once we'd moved and knew where we were, we'd confirm. We moved about a month before 2nd birthday and with job changes and new house with a toddler, it took about 2 weeks to get our head above water. Once we did, we confirmed over the phone to in-laws that we were doing date previously mentioned but that some of my family members had been unable get time off work so we'd do something separately for my family. Husband confirmed with BIL. At this time we became aware of some money stuff for BIL and said we'd get the sofa bed ready if it helped save the hotel stay. 

BIL didn't reply to my husband but did post in family group chat that they weren't coming because we were entitled arseholes who didn't communicate plans, made yet another attack on my family and said it ""wasn't worth their time"". If it had been that they didn't want to spend the money, fine, I get that. My husband and I have both been made redundant and we were done to one wage for a year so we understand that it gets tough and scary but the attack was unwarranted in my opinion. When we raised this message with in-laws they said it was fine and they agreed with it. But when my husband's kicked off, they said they'd speak to BIL. A couple of days later, BIL called and did everything he could to rile up my normally placid husband. It turned into a screaming match. BIL was abhorrent and I admit I shouted when he said that ""all the other parents I know can turn up on time and don't use their child as an excuse."" I was a slightly late person before a baby and with one, I'm late. He doesn't want to go in his car seat, he doesn't want shoes, he just wants to play on the swings in the garden. He is a small human with big emotions and it does mean we don't work like clockwork. We are late sometimes but we always text and let people know how long etc. BIL hung up after husband told him to fuck off over something he said and we haven't spoken since. It has been nearly a year.

In-laws told us to put a pin in it and we'd sort after birthday. Nothing has been said or done since. Just being ignored. Except not because in-laws, especially MIL, is constantly mean and disrespectful to me. Neither of them say hello to me or ask how I am when we see them. They actively choose to say hello to husband and grandchild by name and don't do the same for me. They parent over the top of me, dismiss me when I talk to said child, ignore our child's intolerance and purposefully buy stuff he can't eat. They compliment nieces/nephews but not grandchild and show compassion for other struggling parents in the family but not me. They told my husband to get more sleep right in front of me when they know I do the majority of the childcare and therefore am more sleep deprived. They have even taken to calling husband on a weekday lunchtime so I am not present for the call. Which means grandchild also isn't. 

They just visited this weekend and honestly, I think I am at the end of my rope. My MIL completely set us back in potty training because she kept telling me to leave baby alone because he was just too excited to see them to go potty and kept shushing and flapping me away when I asked. They then peed themself for the first time in two weeks and asked for a nappy. Now they keep asking for nappy and I feel like we've regressed. She also encouraged them to go on a cat hunt when our cats are timid and hide from toddler and guests. She knows we are teaching them to be respectful to animals and we don't chase or hunt them. She proudly told me she even went in our bedroom and pulled back the duvet to see if our male cat was there. Who does that? It is your sons marital bed! 

There was a standout moment for me though; MIL looking at me sitting in the garden, looking down at my body/stomach, pulling a disgusted face and saying ""husband said you'd been going to the gym?"" You can imagine the tone I bet. I simply stated I was exhausted and so I'd gone when I could. Husband wasn't present but was annoyed when I told him. 

Now they've gone and I'm not on autopilot, I am really upset and quite honestly I am done. The third birthday is coming up and I just don't want to do anything with his family. I just know they've gone home and are bitching about whatever they deem me to have done wrong and my body because they openly admitted to doing it for the first year of babies life. They happily told us how they had explained how mean we were to friends and family and they were appalled. My Mum thinks I need to ignore it and let it roll of my back but I am not built that way and I genuinely feel like I get emotionally battered every time they visit.

Am I an AH? Any suggestions?

I am sure someone will call me a toxic DIL but I let MIL hold the baby as soon as she visited for the first time because I was happy to (new mums don't have to if they aren't comfortable), I never turned them away at the door and was always polite. Even when I was told I wouldn't fit up stairs for christs sake.",3,1749040161.0,inlaws,1,1.0,False

That's when it hit me... I've been overthinking so many small challenges in my life, trying to plan every detail perfectly ahead of time, and stressing when it doesn't work out as planned. But really, maybe I should just take a cue from these kiddos. I've gotta learn to let go of the need for perfection and just dive in, try stuff out, and tweak it as I go. It's kinda freeing to think about it that way. Who would've thought a trip to the park could change my whole problem-solving outlook? üòÑ",1,1749040137.0,snapinsight,0,1.0,False

Wrong. Our processor keeps flagging these as gambling transactions because of the ""speculative nature"" of creator coins. Even though these aren't investments - they're literally just digital tips and content purchases. Same way you'd buy a coffee for someone, except it's buying a creator's exclusive video.

The worst part? Traditional gift card processors won't touch us either because ""it's not a recognized retailer."" We're stuck in this weird middle ground where banks don't understand that social platform currencies are becoming actual payment methods.

Has anyone found processors that actually GET this space? The volume is insane (think millions in daily transactions) but everyone treats us like we're running some sketchy casino operation.

The platforms themselves are backing away from traditional payment rails entirely - some are even looking at building their own settlement networks. Which honestly might be the only solution at this point.",1,1749040035.0,Highrisk_Merchant,0,1.0,False

Space, so vast and empty. So easy to get lost in. If you could get into a ship with a hyperdrive, then it would be so easy to be lost. That‚Äôs what everybody thinks, but space is not empty; it‚Äôs more like a giant ocean. The system was the islands, and unknown to most of the ocean, had currents. You drift long enough, and you would crash into something because space is not empty. Hyd-Drin knew this; he saw the currents and he saw the ‚Äòrivers‚Äô in space, the ones people called hyperlanes. It boosted your speed. It was like you were swimming with the current. Of course, there was also the possibility of having to face the current. Just as everybody did as they left the hyperlane and approached Dirt. There was a river there, but it just flowed the wrong way.¬† It made him curious, what was on the other side of that one-way hyperlane. Hyd-Drin was lost in thought as he watched the planet below, the home of the Haran people. He had seen the news about Adam and weddings he was arranging; they called him the god of love now.¬† He wondered how the real god of love would react to this. ¬†Adam, the one with the eyes of the galaxy. He wondered if Adam knew that?

The vision of the Ghorts was always hard to explain to people who lacked it, they saw more than the common spectrum.¬† They also didn‚Äôt see the way people thought. The tentacles all had sensory organs, and they could see shades of colors that most races didn‚Äôt exist; they saw electricity and auras. But try to explain this to somebody who has the completely wrong idea of what auras are. So Ghorts never spoke about it.¬† Most of the time, when they saw Adam, they were too surprised. At first glance, he looked normal, but the more time you spend with him, the more the universe seems to embrace him, and people change around him. Hyd-drin got himself out of the thoughts as the door opened, and Adam came in.¬† Hyd-drin had lost track of time again. He simply waited for Adam to come over.

‚ÄúSo that was fun, we have picked up our guest, so we are going to drop her off back at Hundra, but I want to add a stop after that.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd where is that stop?‚Äù Hyd-drin brought up the sector map, and Adam stared at the hologram.

‚ÄúThere, Fugina 5, it‚Äôs a Scian colony. They had a natural disaster of some sort. We have the equipment, so we drop by and offer it up.‚Äù

Hyd-Drin looked at the map; he knew the flows of that area. It was close to one of the few stable wormholes.¬† Ironically, it didn‚Äôt lead anywhere useful. ‚ÄúSure, we can do that. There is an interesting anomaly there, about five light years from the system.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind?‚Äù

‚ÄúA wormhole, think of it as a tunnel in space, instant travel of ten light years. The only problem is that it‚Äôs straight into dead space.‚Äù

‚ÄúStill, must be crawling with scientists.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? It‚Äôs a wormhole in the middle of nowhere leading to another middle of nowhere.‚Äù He looked at Adam and saw the universe about to laugh.

‚ÄúYes, but it‚Äôs a wormhole.‚Äù Adam laughed. ‚ÄúWhy aren't you guys studying it? What if you learn how to make artificial ones?‚Äù

Hyd-Drin truly felt stupid now; yes, why hadn‚Äôt they studied it? Nobody cared because there was no actual benefit to be gained at that place. And it was considered a natural phenomenon, like the other. These things never occurred near any system or naturally occurring currents.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a science station either. The closest is the‚Ä¶ wait, we can have Jork send us a science vessel, park it there, and leave the other Mercy ship, we can detach the second hangar. Jork should be able to use that hangar to attach a science satellite station. Send a few students to do research for us, and well, if we can't duplicate it, then at least we will have more knowledge about the Wormholes.‚Äù Hyd-Drin stopped himself as the universe simply nodded.

‚ÄúSounds cool, make the calls and don‚Äôt forget the dinner tonight. They want to meet you, too.‚Äù

Hyd-Drin made his suit smile and nodded. ‚ÄúI will be there.‚Äù¬† He really loved this new suit. The controls were so easy to maneuver, and Jork had added a little extra for him when he had joked about needing a suit that could withstand space and hover. It did withstand the space environment, and hovered about 5 centimeters above the ground. That was a party trick inside, but in space it meant propulsion. He had left the ship through an airlock and flown around it.¬† He had never felt so alive. All because he met Adam. The man who didn‚Äôt know himself.

He contacted Jork, who didn‚Äôt even look up from the engine, he had his head deep into it, but when he mentioned Adam had suggested something as crazy as artificial wormholes, he stopped, stood up, and just looked at the drone.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs been disproved centuries ago. It‚Äôs impossible to make artificially.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you want to tell Adam that?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ If he says it's possible, then it is, we just have to find out what he wants us to find. I will assemble a crew and send a ship. How many mercy ships do you have left?‚Äù Jork asked as he moved over to a screen.

‚ÄúStill got the two, he has planned use for one of them, so at the wormhole we will ditch the second. You got another ready? ‚Äú  
I can have two ready and shipped to Ytios, you're heading there next month, right?‚Äù Jork said as he grabbed a cup of coffee and turned to the drone that was recording him.

‚ÄúYes, oh, make sure there are some Ghorts on the team. They might have some extra insight.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe extra sight? Yeah, I'll make sure.‚Äù He replied and sipped his cup, of course Jork knew about it.¬† I‚Äôll get things ready here. I‚Äôll keep you updated.‚Äù Then he cut the connection.¬†

When Hyd-Drin joined the dinner, he was warmly welcomed as a part of the family. This felt so different from his time serving under Kun-Nar, where things were more structured and hierarchical. With Adam, it was a round table atmosphere where everyone chose their own seat, and sometimes there were guests, like today. The Haran Princess had joined them and looked pleasantly surprised by the relaxed vibe. Laughter echoed around the table, with good-natured jokes and kind words shared among friends. Though the whole family wasn‚Äôt present, it felt like they were all connected in spirit. Adam was just watching silently as Evelyn was deep into a story about young Adam, the one everybody wanted to learn about. It was how even the older kids had started calling him big brother. Apparently, it wasn‚Äôt always connected to age, sometimes it was just how they acted, and Adam back then was the big brother.¬† But it was funny to see almost adult kids looking at a sixteen-year-old boy and calling him big brother. ¬†When the Princess asked how big his harem was, the room all looked at Adam, who chuckled, and he lifted one finger.

‚ÄúYou're kidding? Only one? Who is this woman? Who could keep a young man on a leash like that?‚Äù She said it almost in shock, and they all looked at Evelyn, who pleaded innocence.

‚ÄúThere were no leashes involved, only handcuffs.‚Äù

Adam chuckled, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember wearing any handcuffs.‚Äù

‚ÄúI said involved.‚Äù She teased.

‚ÄúOn other matters, we will arrive at Huldra earlier than expected, the hyperlane is beneficial for us this way.‚Äù¬† Hyd-Drin said as he changed to a subject, land dwellers' sex life was of little interest to him. Besides, all the Ghorts could see that those two were two souls connected by something stronger than marriage and sex. Bound by the universe itself. They would probably die if the other died. The current between them was too strong that when they embraced, they looked like one.

‚ÄúWell, I think King Steinar will be happy that we arrive early. I‚Äôm looking forward to the wedding. We just have to drop off something after we drop you off, it should take two months to prepare, which will give us time to finish most of our tour and arrive before the wedding.‚Äù Adam said, seemingly glad for the change of topic.

‚ÄúI got some good news as well, Roks said. I spoke with Kun-Nar and had his report just confirmed. The main fleet of Jargy Mut is still in hiding. They seem to be waiting for something.¬† But he had taken out four pirate bases, pushing them further into deep space.¬† By all accounts, it will take them a month just to reach a hyperlane.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich sectors are they suspecting them to be in?‚Äù Hyd-Drin said. He was curious now.

‚ÄúNorthwest of Fyntas hub. Here!‚Äù¬† Roks sent him the location on the map, and Hyd-Drin looked at it.

‚ÄúHmm, there are hyperlanes there, natural ones.‚Äù He drew them in. ‚ÄúThey all emerge in the Bju-nio sector.¬† And no nations controls those sectors. That‚Äôs a corp sector‚Äù They looked at him. That ¬†meant it was a sector where many of the megacorps had their factories; they did not allow the military in there. They had their own.

‚ÄúAnd we are back to the Mega-Corporations,‚Äù Adam said with a sigh. ‚ÄúSend that intel to all our allies so they know where the pirates are escaping to. They might even have a base in that system. I really start to hate those companies.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre a mega corporation,‚Äù The princess countered, a little confused.

‚ÄúYes, but I‚Äôm not only about the credits. My company grew from just five to what it is today because I want to make the best product, and the majority of the credit goes back into the company. I don‚Äôt mind people making credits, hell, I‚Äôm even starting to like it, because it gives me the opportunity to do what I want. And I want a peaceful and safe galaxy for my family and friends.¬† If that means I won‚Äôt be able to squeeze out every credit I can, then I‚Äôm okay with that. Product and reputation come first.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut then the others will win, they will have more profit.‚Äù She countered, and Adam smiled.

‚ÄúAre they winning? They are in such pursuit of credits that that‚Äôs all they see. They allied themselves with religious nutjobs, pirates, and slavers to take me out just because I‚Äôm growing and might challenge their product. All of this without doing what they should have done. Make a better product.‚Äù

She looked at him, and Hyd-Drin smiled inside his suit. Just like that, he proved to her why he was who everybody thought he was. No miracle, no demands or manipulation, simply stating the fact. The war they waged against him was unnecessary, and more and more saw it. It just made people side with Adam. He didn‚Äôt start a war, he treated people with respect and tried to better the galaxy in his own way. And the Galaxy was getting better, just as the prophecy had said.

She looked at him as it sank in. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre the good guy? The good company?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm just a man trying to do his best. I‚Äôm just not greedy.‚Äù Adam replied. The rest of the dinner returned to its normal bantering. They talked about Runur and Shi-La still hadn‚Äôt left the room after the four days they had stayed there. Apparently, they were both accepting the marriage.

¬†They dropped off the princess and stayed a day before they sat course for Fugina 5.

When they arrived, one of the hangars detached, and the mercy ship within emerged and set course for the planet. Hyd-Drin had stopped being impressed by these small ideas from Adam. The detachable hangar allowed them to leave the mercy ship with a base, a small space station where the scientists could work in peace and devise solutions, as well as serve as a temporary spaceport for larger ships. Adam and Arus visited the planet to speak with the administration. Eighty-nine percent of the population had died suddenly from something that was neither a virus nor bacteria; it was some sort of gas. They gathered all the scans and intel the survivors had discovered while the medical and search-and-rescue droids were set free to ensure the safety of the survivors and search for additional survivors. When Adam returned, he and Arus spent a few days in quarantine just to be safe. When he emerged, they had stopped by the Wormhole, and the ships Roks had sent were already there.

Adam stood on the bridge looking into the emptiness of space; wormholes were not visible to human eyes. To Hyd-Drin it looked like hole that sucked in everything that came across it, but not strong enough to suck in light, that happened inside. It looked like a tube of energy that vanished out of view. It was an amazing view.

‚ÄúThere is something out there. Bring us through.‚Äù Adam suddenly said and Hyd-drin was confused.¬†  
‚ÄúPerhaps we should take a shuttle? This one has been stable for millennia, but you never know when it will break.‚Äù

Adam turned to him and smiled. ‚ÄúOkay!‚Äù Then he walked out. ¬†It took him a second to realize what Adam meant, and soon they were in his old ship, upgraded with new sensors and a more effective engine. He sent a blessing to Jork, the true god of engineering.¬† When the ship took off, he switched the screen interface to show Adam what the wormhole looked like, and he could see Adam admire it, then quickly turned on all the sensors he could find.

‚ÄúYou know we won‚Äôt discover anything new.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow can you be so sure? We have better sensors now. Just because we could not discover its secrets back then doesn‚Äôt mean we can't do it now with better equipment?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, there are always somebody trying to research it, but nobody has discovered anything new. It's one of the universe's mysteries. Some things are just meant to be admired.‚Äù ¬†Hyd-Drin replied.

‚ÄúYou won't say that when we install a gate generator on your ship.‚Äù Adam replied just as they entered the hole, Hyd-Drin just stared at Adam, shocked, what did he mean by when and not if.

Then Adam's vision changed, like everybody who entered a wormhole, their aura became stronger. Sometimes, a strong aura would block out their physical body. To people it felt like a soft electric tickle running through the body, for a second, he could swear Adam's skin was gone and he was sitting next to the universe in human shape, this was the true aura of Adam, then it vanished and as Adam let out a scream of pure joy.

‚ÄúYES! That was amazing!‚Äù He looked at the vast space with the joy of a child. ‚ÄúHow far did we go?‚Äù

‚ÄúTen light years.‚Äù He shocked himself out of the shock. There was no doubt anymore. Why was Adam denying who he was? He needed to talk to Monori.

Adam looked at the screen. ‚ÄúLook, what is that?‚Äù

Hyd-Drin looked at it and found himself smiling. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the space dust, mostly silicon, gold, Carbon, and water.‚Äù

‚ÄúGold? I keep forgetting it's so common in space. On Earth, it's quite valuable, well, it was until space travel.‚Äù He looked at the screen. ‚ÄúIsn't that diamond also?‚Äù

Hyd-Drin looked at the screen. ‚ÄúYes. Strange‚Ä¶ Not the diamond but the pattern. Just like the hyperlanes, just more intense.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait? So this is like a hyper-hyperlane? Is it possible to make an artificial hyperlane?‚Äù

""Yes, but those are expensive. They also take a lot of time; you need to provide support every half-light year. There are some ways to make it simpler.""

‚ÄúSo, wormholes are just hyperlanes on steroids. So then we need to find a hyperlane we can experiment with. Try to turn it into a wormhole.‚Äù Adam said as he looked back at the wormhole. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go back.‚Äù

Hyd-drin thought about it as they flew back into the wormhole. Looking at Adam, then it hit him.

‚ÄúThat won't work, but I think I know what. I need to talk to Jork!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Hyd-Drin: Ghort pilot, best one around.

Adam Wrangler: Not Galius and a completely normal human; we checked his DNA, no alien stuff there.

Jork: The gods of engineers.

He brought over my favorite takeout‚Äîextra spring rolls, just how I like it‚Äîand suggested we have an impromptu picnic on my living room floor. We spread out an old blanket, lit a few candles, and just... talked. Nothing grand, nothing planned, just us sharing stories, laughs, even the not-so-great parts of our day.

It felt like the weight of everything just lifted. Honestly, just having him there, spending quality time together, made everything seem a bit less overwhelming. We didn't need to talk about the tough stuff the whole time; just being together was its own kind of comfort.

1l340xp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l340xp,"Dev of WalkScape here, the cozy RPG where you progress by walking in real life. We're inviting new players & have released a bunch of new updates, including smart watch support on iOS!","Hello there r/CozyGamers ‚ù§Ô∏è

First off, I have struggled to exercise enough, and I also have ADHD. Gamifying exercise works really well for my dopamine-craving brain, but I'm also easily distracted, so the current mobile fitness games on the market didn't really work for me. That's how I came up with this idea.

Here are some info about the game and how it's different from Pokemon Go for example:

* no distractions. I love games that value my time. WalkScape is designed so that it encourages you not to open it while you're walking, but afterwards. And even if you open it while walking, changing things in the game is super quick.
* no GPS. So you can walk where ever you want. The game tracks your steps even without an internet connection, but you need a connection when you open the game.
* no ads, no MTX. I hate predatory monetisation practises, and they encourage unhealthy spending habits. This game is about both mental and physical health.

In the game, you explore and work in different skills such as woodcutting, foraging, fishing and crafting by walking in real life. The game uses your phone's pedometer to track your progress. It's also online, so you can work with your friends towards common goals without needing to be physically in the same location.

The game has dozens of locations, hundreds of items, NPCs, shops and more is coming as I work towards the full release of the game. There's a lot of different unique and cute activities in the game you can set your character to do in addition to the typical woodcutting and mining, like volunteering in soup kitchen or helping locals repairing their boats. All fueled by walking IRL.

We've added the following things recently to the game, while we have also updated¬†[the roadmap on our website](https://walkscape.app/roadmap):

* **Smart watch support for iOS!**¬†No need to carry your phone with you while walking, as you can on iOS now use your Apple Watch, Garmin etc. to track your steps. Smart watch support is coming to Android later too!
* An entirely new skill, Trinketry. Craft rings, amulets and more shiny things using the new skill!
* A lot more content. Entirely new region, a lot of new items, achievements, crafting recipes, locations, shops and more!
* Bunch of other improvements, minor features, Quality of Life updates!

If you feel like you'd like to try it out, you can either apply to the closed beta (we're inviting more people right now) or if you like to support the development, you get instant to access through¬†[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/WalkScape)¬†or¬†[Buy me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/walkscape)¬†to start playing. The game is completely community funded.

Whether you decide to support or apply to the closed beta, you'll need to sign up at¬†[WalkScape Portal¬†](https://portal.walkscape.app/)to the game and then apply or connect your Patreon on the¬†[account page](https://portal.walkscape.app/account).

You can also check our this video to hear me and the artist explain more about the game:¬†[Youtube introduction video](https://youtu.be/RjaQeb5Rapg?si=AUeqlLpEdBGDOC-y).

Or you can¬†[visit the website](https://walkscape.app/).

We also have my devblogs released every two weeks available at¬†[r/WalkScape](https://www.reddit.com/r/WalkScape/)

At one of my projects we were nearing completion of an office renovation and the tenants had moved in while we‚Äôre were still finishing up (mounting devices like light switches or computer outlets under desks) during our last couple days there. 

We would take a coffee break at 9:30am and return at 9:45am and the office staff would take theirs at 10am. One day, my journeyman and I cam back from coffee and returned to our spots under desks wiring in the outlets. Soon after, we heard the elevator doors open and a few women returned from their coffee break. We were under desks, so they didn‚Äôt see anyone in the room. One of the women had apparently been telling the others about some guy she had met at the bar on the weekend. 

I was going to indicate our presence to them since the details of the event we‚Äôre getting quite sexual but I looked over at my journeyman under a desk across from me and he was frantically indicating with his hands I should not say a word so he could hear what she had to say to her coworkers. 

So we stayed hidden under our desks as she gave every sordid detail about how she gave the guy a blowjob in his car. She described its shape, length, how it felt in her hands‚Ä¶ how he responded to her touch, and the sounds he made when she gave him an earth shattering orgasm. 

One of her coworkers asked ‚ÄúDo you think he‚Äôll call you?‚Äù and before she could respond all you heard from under a desk was my journeyman‚Äôs voice casually saying ‚ÄúI sure would‚Äù.

# Chapter 1

""Ms. Sampson, this is your fake death plan. Do you want to 'fall off a cliff and die' on the day of the global wedding live broadcast in half a month?""

""Yes.""

The staff solemnly said, ""If you fake your death during the live broadcast, you will never be able to restore your current identity.""

Julissa Sampson clenched the proposal in her hand and nodded heavily.

""Yes, I am sure.""

Leaving the building, Julissa came face to face with the giant screen in the commercial square, where Adonis Ferguson was hugging her and announcing their engagement in a video.

The man was handsome and wealthy, the woman was graceful and beautiful, even the passing vehicles were attracted by this scene, and they slowed down one after another.

In the video, Adonis held her tightly. He was always decisive, but at that moment his eyes were red-rimmed and his voice was trembling uncontrollably.

""Today was the most important day of my life, because Ms. Sampson accepted my proposal. Here, I solemnly invite everyone to join us for the live global broadcast of our wedding next month...""

The barrage on the big screen was rolling rapidly.

It is said that he fell in love with Julissa at first sight when he was nineteen years old;

At the age of twenty, she chose to start a business in order to live up to her family background.

At the age of twenty-two, he flew over two hundred times in one year to see his overseas study partner Julissa.

""Man's love brain is actually the best 'bonus point'!""

Glancing at the barrage of comments, Julissa's eyes were full of mockery. She lowered her head and brightened the screen of her phone, looking again at the chat screenshots on her phone.

In the top photo, a strange woman seductively looked at the camera with her eyes like silk, her skirt lifted high, revealing a swollen red buttocks.

""Adonis, you really hurt my butt yesterday! You have half an hour to come over and give me a massage, or else I'll cry, the kind that can't be comforted!""

And Adonis below almost instantly replied, ""Wait for me.""

\*\*\*

The whole world envied her for finding a good man, and everyone said how much Adonis loved her.

Only she knew that Adonis had been keeping a female college student outside for two whole years.

Tears blurred Julissa's vision, and she felt a bit dazed.

When she was nineteen, her parents passed away. As she cried until she almost fainted, Adonis held her in his arms and swore to her deceased parents that he would take care of her in the future.

He once had his leg broken by a huge rock to protect her, and once because of her love for food, he flew all over Cuskeoland.

She knew all his bank passwords and phone passwords, and every profile picture on his social media platforms was her...

Even on the day of the proposal, Adonis cried and said that he could never live without her in his life, and asked her to swear that she would marry him for eternity.

He was such a man who, while saying he couldn't live without her, went to see another woman for an affair on the night he proposed.

Thinking about the scene she saw the night she was proposed to, Julissa closed her eyes in despair.

Since he betrayed so thoroughly, don't blame her for breaking her vow.

She had to fake her death in front of everyone, completely erase all traces of ""Julissa,"" and disappear forever from his side.

Julissa wiped away her tears and was about to stand up when suddenly her shoulder sank.

A tall figure bent down to help her up, carefully wrapping her in his arms.

""Julissa, didn't I ask you to wait obediently for me to go choose the engagement ring together? Why did you come out on your own and squat by the roadside?""

Seeing the tears on her face, Adonis's tone carried a hint of anxiety.

""Why are you crying? Did you get hurt somewhere?""

Julissa did not answer, she just looked at him quietly.

The anxiety and concern on his face did not seem fake, but the fresh scent of citrus perfume indicated that he had been in close contact with that woman.

She turned her head to avoid the scent of perfume on him, lowered her eyes to conceal the fleeting disgust that passed through her.

If just seeing her tears made him so flustered, she wondered what his reaction would be when he watched her die at the wedding.

After a long time, until Adonis checked her up and down to make sure she was not injured, Julissa spoke faintly, ""Aunt Flo is here, my stomach hurts.""

# Chapter 2

Adonis's hand paused, his tone a bit stiff.

""Sorry Julissa, I have been too busy lately and forgot that you were on your period. We are almost back to the car, and there is a blanket in the car!""

Julissa silently followed him back to the car, letting Adonis wrap her up in a blanket.

In the past, he always remembered her menstrual period even more clearly than she did herself, but in just a few short months, everything changed.

The smell of citrus perfume filled the car, and she inexplicably thought of the photo taken in the car some time ago.

The woman leaned against the car window, her whole body disheveled, while Adonis beside her had a smile of horror on his face.

\*\*\*

The driver parked the car in front of the jewelry store, but Adonis remained silent for a long time.

Julissa turned her head slightly and caught sight of Adonis's lips curling up high, as well as the cute cat avatar on the phone screen.

Noticing her gaze, he quickly turned off his phone, reached out to rub her head, and handed her a black gold card, saying, ""Julissa, the company has some temporary issues, so you go to the jewelry store first, and I'll come back to pick you up later.""

Julissa got out of the car in silence.

She had barely stood firm when Adonis directed the driver to turn the car around, and in less than three seconds, he disappeared from her sight.

The jewelry store clerk approached eagerly, ""Ms. Sampson, Mr. Ferguson had the designer create 34 different styles for you to choose from!""

Turning her gaze away, Julissa shook her head at the store clerk, saying, ""Don't bother looking, just pick one for me.""

After all, she was going to ""commit suicide"" at her own wedding, and a dead bride would not have the chance to wear a wedding ring.

\*\*\*

Julissa did not listen to Adonis's advice and, after casually choosing a diamond ring, she went home alone.

The first thing she did when she got home was to grind a cup of coffee - she had been suffering from insomnia for over ten days, relying on coffee to keep herself awake every day.

A message suddenly popped up on the phone, and Julissa's hand holding the coffee shook violently.

The scalding hot coffee splashed all over her chest, but she didn't even notice, just staring fixedly at the screen.

Selina Greene texted her again, this time with a video.

The video was blurry, and only the bodies intertwined could be vaguely seen, but the conversation in it was incredibly clear.

Selina gasped, out of breath, ""Adonis... is my butt perky or... is her butt perky?""

A familiar voice murmured hoarsely, ""You are sexier than her.""

Later, a bony hand forcefully twisted a woman's buttocks.

The hand even wore a gemstone ring personally designed for him by Julissa.

Julissa was trembling all over, and she almost had to use all her strength to turn off the screen.

She forced herself to shift her focus, flipping through the documents and new identity provided by the fake death organization. From dawn until dusk, she had not received any messages from Adonis. Just as she was about to go to sleep, her text message alert suddenly sounded.

She lowered her head to look, but it was a series of photos sent by Selina.

The first picture is a profile of Adonis sleeping, followed by several selfies of Selina.

The snow-white body was covered with congested love bites.

""Adonis said he wanted to leave his marks all over my body, otherwise he wouldn't let me go...""

""Julissa, was his need for you so strong?""

Julissa looked unusually calm.

For the next seven hours, she did nothing.

She just stared at the phone screen, ""until the sky was getting light.""

When Adonis came back, he saw Julissa, with red eyes, curled up on the sofa, her hands tightly gripping the phone and trembling slightly.

He was surprised and quickly stepped forward to embrace Julissa in his arms, ""Julissa, why are your eyes so red? Have you been crying?""

Julissa turned off her phone and rubbed her eyes haphazardly.

Looking at Adonis's disheveled appearance, she tugged at the corner of her mouth, revealing a smile that didn't reach her eyes.

""It's nothing, I just had a nightmare just now.""

# Chapter 3

Adonis's tense body relaxed, he rubbed her head, and bent down to give her a gentle kiss on her forehead.

""The baby doesn't need to be afraid of nightmares, the husband is back, the husband will protect you!""

Seeing Julissa in a daze, Adonis softened and kissed her deeply twice, full of remorse.

""Julissa, yesterday I left you alone in the jewelry store, I was wrong, tomorrow I will take you to buy a few estates to compensate you, okay?""

Julissa still did not speak, but he took it as acquiescence, carried her back to the bedroom, tucked her in, and stayed by her side studying the property locations all night.

The next afternoon, Adonis personally did her hair and poured a full pot of milk for her, then took her to the real estate company.

The real estate agent showed the couple around various estate models, and whenever Julissa took a second look, Adonis would not hesitate to have the agent book it, even though she was actually not interested in these properties.

During the downtime of the paperwork, the real estate agent took them to the golf course behind the company.

On the field, several bosses who had worked with the Ferguson Group gathered around to joke about Adonis's deeds when they heard about it.

""Mr. Ferguson really spared no expense for his beauty, several vacation estates I had picked out for my wife were all taken away!""

""Mr. Ferguson, can I have that vacation estate? Next time we work together, I can give you a profit share?""

Adonis carefully poured a glass of milk and handed it to Julissa, ""What happens in our house is not up to me, only Julissa's approval matters.""

Julissa pretended not to hear, gently pushing away the milk in his hand, ""I'm not thirsty.""

Seeing the situation, Jaron knew it was hopeless, and he returned to his place dejectedly.

""Wanna play golf? I'll accompany you!"" Adonis smiled gently, lightly holding her hand.

Julissa was just about to refuse when there was a commotion coming from the adjacent Jaron's serving station.

A girl screamed and fell to the ground, while Jaron slammed and hit the ground with a club, cursing angrily, ""Isn't being a part-time caddy just for people to sleep with? How dare you push me, watch me beat you to death today!""

Adonis looked over to the next door and suddenly froze.

Julissa followed his gaze and saw a face that had appeared countless times on her phone screen, now appearing in front of her.

Selina wore a pure white sporty skirt suit today. She, full of youthful energy, sat at Jaron's feet, like a clean and delicate little white flower.

As Jaron's swearing became increasingly vulgar, Selina began to sob, casting pleading looks towards Adonis.

Julissa had just about to avert her gaze when she felt a light touch on her hand.

Adonis let go of her hand.

His pace quickened with anxiety, ""Julissa, it seems like my friend has run into some trouble. Wait for me here.""

Without waiting for her answer, he strode quickly to the adjacent serving table.

Adonis negotiated with great tact, but throughout, his gaze was nervously fixed on Selina's injured leg, without once looking back at her.

Selina left, and he quickly returned to her side, but she still sensed something unusual from his tense tone.

""It was just a misunderstanding. I handed over our vacation estate to Jaron, just to make amends...""

Julissa paused, nodded gently.

The next second, Adonis glanced down at his phone, discreetly turned the screen away from her view, and then kissed Julissa's forehead.

""Julissa, there was a problem with the paperwork for the house, I went to talk to them.""

With that, he turned around and left without looking back.

Julissa watched Adonis leave in silence, not releasing her tightly clenched hand until she could no longer see his back.

Her long manicured nails were deeply embedded in the flesh, her palm already a bloody mess. But she seemed oblivious, staring fixedly at the messages on her phone screen.

""Adonis, he insisted on being in the bathroom with me, saying it's more exciting this way...""

She sat still for a long time, then got up and walked to the bathroom.

\*\*\*

The lights were dim, and the doors of each cubicle in the bathroom were wide open, except for the one closest to the inside.

The sound of the collision echoed throughout the corridor.

The further she went in, the low gasps of women and men mixed together rushed into Julissa's ears.

After a loud ""thud"", the compartment was filled with increasingly intense banging sounds.

The man's low growl became more pronounced.

The man's voice was so familiar, so familiar that Julissa didn't need to see for herself to know who it was.

She desperately covered her mouth, suppressing her sobs.

# Chapter 4

A muffled groan was heard, and the sound of impact in the compartment ceased.

The sizzling sound of kisses continued.

Julissa couldn't take it anymore and ran out, covering her mouth and stumbling.

She avoided all places where she might run into people, and desperately ran in the opposite direction of the bathroom, hiding behind the sofa in the coffee room.

She gasped heavily, tears streaming down like a broken dam.

She thought she had become numb long ago after seeing those photos and videos.

She could feel the pain even more acutely when she bumped into it face to face, and she was on the verge of fainting.

She couldn't help but think of her intimate moments with Adonis.

The frequency between them was not high, but every time he was with her, he was gentle and tender. Whenever she cried out in pain, he would stop, no matter how uncomfortable he was.

Even when she actively wanted to play more boldly, he refused, saying it would make her too tired.

She originally thought she had found someone who would truly hold her in the palm of their hand and protect her.

But now it seems that he probably found being with her not exciting enough, and wanted to find someone who could arouse his desires more.

Her hands tightly covered her face, tears streaming continuously through her fingers.

Adonis called, she silenced the phone and let the incoming call notification light up the screen.

Almost at the same time, Selina's message popped up again.

""Adonis was so fierce this time, did we scare our sister? But it's all my fault. Who asked him to just save me and give that vacation villa to Jaron as a favor... And also, this ring, Adonis said he gave it to me!""

At a glance, Julissa recognized that the ring in the photo was the same one Adonis was wearing.

The diamond on this ring is a rare sapphire that Julissa searched for three months to find, and the ring setting with the embedded gemstone is hammered into shape by her own hands with a small hammer. In order to carve the patterns on it, she suffered a permanent waist injury.

The ring, which she had polished for half a year, is now worn on Selina's hand.

Closing her eyes, Julissa turned off her phone.

She applied ice cubes to her slightly swollen eyes, and then used an eyeliner pencil to redraw the eyeliner that had already smudged.

When she finished her makeup and walked out the door, she ran into Adonis who was calling her name.

Adonis pulled her into his arms and said with a tense voice, ""I have been looking for you after completing the property transfer procedures, why are you running around everywhere!""

Julissa took a deep breath, the scent of citrus filling her nostrils. She looked into his eyes and struggled to suppress the lump in her throat.

""Have the procedures been completed? Perfect timing, I was planning to go on vacation next week, I want to stay in that holiday villa.""

His eyes flickered, and he looked around before saying, ""We are getting married soon, why go there? Julissa, stop acting like a child and thinking one thing after another.""

Upon hearing this, Julissa raised her lips and glanced over Adonis's fingers, the ring was indeed missing.

In the past, not to mention next week, even if she wanted to go to a certain city that afternoon, Adonis could take her there immediately. He always said she was lovely, full of tricks and ideas.

Now there was another woman, and in his eyes, her thoughts had all become immature.

She looked at Adonis with tears in her eyes.

From the age of nineteen until now, she only just realized that he is such a hypocritical person.

Looking at Julissa's expression, Adonis felt a hint of panic and pity in his eyes. He gently rubbed her head and said, ""If you want me to go with you, it's fine. It doesn't matter where we stay. I'll book the presidential suite at the Hilton in advance for you, so you can stay comfortably...""

Julissa's tears fell uncontrollably, with a self-deprecating smile hanging at the corner of her mouth.

This man not only double standards, but also doesn't need to take notes when lying.

Adonis anxiously reached out to wipe away Julissa's tears, but suddenly a voice sounded in his ear.

""Mr. Ferguson, I wanted to come specially to thank you for your help...""

Selina was still dressed in a simple white sportswear, looking pitiful and fragile.

Adonis stiffened suddenly, then casually waved his hand, ""You're welcome, it's nothing.""

He wanted to continue helping Julissa wipe away her tears, but she pushed him away and said, ""I have something to do, I'm leaving.""

""Julissa!""

He instinctively wanted to chase after her, but Selina just climbed onto his arm.

After a moment of distraction, Julissa disappeared around the corner.

Adonis turned pale and abruptly let go of Selina's hand, ""How many times have I told you not to appear in the same place as Julissa at the same time?! If she finds out, be careful, I'll kill you!""

Selina stood still, her face turning pale and then white. This was the first time in two years that she had seen him look at her with such a fierce and unforgiving expression, showing no trace of the past affection.

She bit her lip unwillingly, and the next second she immediately coquettishly said with tears in her eyes, ""I just wanted to work part-time at the stadium to buy you a gift, I didn't expect to run into you. And she didn't seem to notice, did she?""

""In order to buy you a birthday gift, I did all kinds of part-time jobs every day, my legs were bruised...""

Tears in her eyes gradually turned into sobs, she cried uncontrollably, and directly squatted on the ground. Her collar was pulled down by him, exposing her white chest with most of it exposed as she squatted down, covered with kiss marks.

Upon hearing her sincere words and seeing this scene, Adonis' eyes darkened and his throat kept rolling uncontrollably.

He could no longer bear it, so he bent down and picked her up with a horizontal lift...

# Chapter 5

Adonis didn't come back all night, only sending a message saying ""there was something to work overtime at the company.""

Julissa knew he was lying, but she didn't ask him, let alone cry and make a scene, just buried herself in her own affairs.

Since she had decided to fake her own death and leave him, she was determined to cover all her tracks.

After the wedding, he never found anything related to her again except for a corpse.

She first packed away the infrequently used items, and then sent them along with her personal valuables to the fake death company. After all, the secure and proper storage of personal belongings is also part of the fake death service.

Finally, she took out a large jewelry box from the safe on the dressing table.

She was a jewelry designer, and her most satisfying works, apart from the award-winning pieces, were all in this box.

Inside were the couple accessories she designed on every anniversary since they met, belonging only to her and Adonis.

Couples' engagement rings, couples' watches, couples' necklaces, and couples' brooches, each adorned with diamonds and jewels, are priceless.

Adonis would open it every now and then to admire it for a long time, touching it over and over again,¬†",1,1749039051.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False
