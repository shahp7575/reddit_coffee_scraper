I've drafted this post so many times but I end up writing a whole novel of background info. So here is my dilemma: My mom is broke. She works in sales and hasn't made a commission in years and I am terrified. The economy right now is in the dumpster, so i get it. I, myself, finished school in December and have been job hunting ever since and finally landed 2 part time jobs. Yay me! [Sidenote: I know the economy is bad but like daaaaaaamn] Now I can finally focus my time (when I'm not working) on building a portfolio in hopes of landing a full time job in my chosen career (software dev - current market for this field is also giving me anxiety but I love it so I'm pushing through. Also this is my second career ( I'm 30+ yrs old)). I don't make anywhere near the amount needed to help with the mortgage or her credit card debt (I personally don't do credit cards or any form of debt, if I cant pay cash then I can't afford it). I can cover my expenses and utility. My goal is to move out of her home as soon as I can for my own wellbeing (unrelated to the current issue at hand). She is always yelling at me about this in a way that sounds like I am the cause of this. I am usually supportive of her ideas to branch out into other industries and am honest when I dont think the idea is good (like starting a coffee shop - she knows nothing about coffee, the coffee scene is very competitive where we live and most shops do not make it, and it's too expensive to start). I think she would do well as a sales coach or life coach for single mothers ( her idea) but she refuses to learn the basics of social media (how to make a video, how to upload a video) and is constantly outsourcing to people who aren't good (think PowerPoint slide as a reel) or just straight up scam her. She signs up for things that she doesnt know how to use (VERY tech illiterate) that cost a lot of money. She is great at sales, she rocks at it but the women is impulsive, 0 patience, does not want to learn and does not think critically. Inevitably, she yells at me to fix her problems and when I try to teach her how to solve her own problems I get yelled at more and get insulted. I know her problems are hers, they aren't mine to bear but old habits die hard. I've tried asking and communicating to her to not unload her problems into my lap, I've tried guiding her to look up resources like guiding her through borrowing an ebook from the library or free online marketing courses through the library but she just doesnt bother learning and is always asking then yelling if I dont do it for her. I'm at my wits end. I've suggested finding a different kind of sales job (sales but different product) and her response is ""so i can make $10/hr, ha"" to which I inform her that ""no, other types of sales jobs can be very lucrative because they're commission based"" and she responded with ""so find me one. I dont know how to do it"" and I told her indeed.com and well that didnt go over too well with her. Now I do have a lot of empathy for my mom. She moved to a foreign country on her own (single mom) and she worked her butt off my entire life. She's tired, she wants to retire and live a soft life. I would love to be rich enough to let her retire but alas that is not my current reality. 

I dont want to postpone my future and have to learn marketing, video editing, etc to get her going in coaching and sales. I just want to go to my 2 part time jobs that I'm super excited by, work on my coding projects that really excite me and apply to dev jobs (get a full time job in my field) then save enough money and leave. Also, no one experiences this side of her but me. 

Any advice on how to handle this situation would be greatly appreciated.

## Key Features Analysis

The best mother of pearl trays boast a combination of exquisite craftsmanship,durable materials,and thoughtful design,ensuring both aesthetic appeal and long-lasting functionality.

**Material Composition**

The quality of a mother of pearl tray hinges on both the nacre itself and the base material. High-end trays use carefully selected mother of pearl, known for its vibrant iridescence and smooth texture. This naturally occurring material is meticulously inlaid onto a solid base,frequently enough made of wood,metal,or resin. The specific type of wood or metal used can significantly impact the tray's weight, durability, and overall aesthetic. Premium trays use hardwoods like mahogany or strong metals such as stainless steel to ensure resilience and prevent warping over time.

**Inlay Pattern and Design**

Mother of pearl trays showcase a diverse range of inlay patterns, from intricate floral motifs to geometric designs and abstract compositions. The craftsmanship involved in creating these patterns is crucial; precise cutting and seamless placement of individual nacre pieces result in a visually stunning and refined product.Handcrafted trays often feature unique, one-of-a-kind designs that add an artisanal touch. The complexity and detail of the inlay pattern greatly influence the tray's overall value and visual appeal.

**size and Dimensions**

Mother of pearl trays are available in various sizes, catering to different uses and space constraints. Smaller trays are ideal for serving cocktails,displaying jewelry,or organizing bedside essentials. Larger trays can function as elegant serving platters for appetizers or desserts, or as decorative centerpieces on coffee tables.The optimal size depends on the intended purpose and the dimensions of the space where the tray will be placed. Dimensions should be carefully considered to ensure the tray fits comfortably and complements its surroundings.

**Edge and Handle Design**

The design of the tray's edges and handles plays a notable role in its functionality and aesthetic appeal. Trays with raised edges prevent items from sliding off, making them more practical for serving. Handles, whether integrated or detachable, provide a secure grip for carrying. Decorative edges, such as scalloped or carved details, add an extra touch of elegance. Considerations should include the material of the handle (metal, wood, or mother of pearl) and its ergonomic design for comfortable and secure handling.

**Finish and Coating**

The finish and coating applied to a mother of pearl tray significantly impact its durability and resistance to stains and scratches. A protective coating, such as a lacquer or varnish, seals the nacre and base material, preventing moisture damage and preserving the tray's luster. High-quality finishes are also resistant to yellowing or fading over time.Proper coating helps maintain the tray's pristine appearance, ensuring it withstands regular use and remains a cherished piece for years to come.

**Weight and Stability**

The weight and stability of a mother of pearl tray are crucial factors that contribute to its practicality, especially for serving purposes. A well-balanced tray should sit flat and evenly on any surface without wobbling or tipping. The weight of the tray should be substantial enough to prevent it from easily sliding around but not so heavy that it becomes cumbersome to carry. Stability is enhanced by a solid base and strategically placed supports or nonslip feet, ensuring the tray can securely hold its contents.

Key features of the best mother of pearl trays include:

 Handcrafted mother of pearl inlays
 Durable and long-lasting construction
 Exquisite designs and patterns
 Protective coating for stain and scratch resistance

## FAQs Section

**How do I clean and maintain a mother of pearl tray?**

to properly clean a mother of pearl tray, gently wipe it with a soft, damp cloth. Avoid using harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, or scouring pads, as they can scratch or damage the delicate nacre. For stubborn stains, use a mild soap diluted in water. After cleaning, dry the tray thoroughly with a clean, soft cloth to prevent water spots. To maintain its luster, periodically apply a thin layer of furniture polish specifically designed for delicate surfaces.

**Can mother of pearl trays be used outdoors?**

It is indeed generally not recommended to use mother of pearl trays outdoors.Prolonged exposure to sunlight, moisture, and extreme temperatures can cause the nacre to fade, crack, or detach from the base material. Additionally, outdoor elements can damage the finish and coating, reducing the tray's durability and overall appearance. For outdoor use, consider using trays made of more weather-resistant materials.

**Are mother of pearl trays environmentally enduring?**

The sustainability of mother of pearl trays largely depends on the sourcing practices of the nacre. Responsible manufacturers use ethically harvested mother of pearl from sustainable sources to minimize environmental impact.Look for trays made by companies that employ eco-friendly practices and adhere to responsible sourcing standards. Some manufacturers also use recycled materials for the base and packaging, further contributing to sustainability.

**Are all mother of pearl trays handcrafted?**

While many mother of pearl trays feature handcrafted elements, such as the intricate inlay patterns, not all are entirely handcrafted. Some trays may incorporate machine-made components or use automated assembly processes.Handcrafted trays typically exhibit finer details and unique variations, making them more valuable and desirable. Check the product description or manufacturer's information to determine the level of craftsmanship involved in creating a specific tray.

Ever feel like the afternoon hits and suddenly you're a zombie? 🧟‍♂️ You're rolling at full speed in the morning, and then BOOM—2 p.m. and it's like a switch flips. **If this has ever been you, raise your hand!** I've been there too, trust me.

Usually, I’d be scrambling for a cup of coffee number three or a sugar rush with some snacks that only betray me with a crash later. 😴 But guess what—I tried something different last week that didn’t just get me through the afternoon but actually gave me an energy boost! 🚀

**Enter: Box Breathing.** 🧘‍♀️ Heard of it? It's a super simple breathing technique that’s supposed to help balance your cortisol levels, the sneaky little hormone that plays a big part in your energy dips.

Here's the lowdown of what I did for 7 days straight:

1. **Get comfortable:** Sit back and relax. You deserve it!
2. **Breathe in for 4 seconds:** Deep as a sigh of relief after finding a last-minute solution!
3. **Hold for 4 seconds:** Think of it as your brain saying, “Pause, I've got this.”
4. **Exhale for 4 seconds:** Slow, like giving up the weight of all that stress.
5. **Hold for another 4:** Doing absolutely nothing, and isn't that a treat? 😌

**Repeat for about 5 minutes.** Don't worry about the time—it's okay if you zone out a little or lose track.

**Why did I even try this?** 🤔 Several studies say that this kind of controlled breathing helps regulate your body’s stress response by adjusting cortisol levels. It’s like pressing 'reset' on your internal energy flow!

So, how did it go for me? By Day 3, I was surprised at how much more focused I felt in the late afternoon. By Day 5, I felt like I could take on extra tasks that I usually sideline till tomorrow. By Day 7, it wasn’t just my energy; my mood did a nice little upgrade too. 🌟

Now I’m curious—have any of you ever tried Box Breathing or something similar? What’s your go-to hack to fight that sleepy afternoon dragon? 🐉 Let’s chat about it!",1,1753942430.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Let me just tell a story, one I will never forget, but today I was especially reminded of it, of every painstaking detail. It is best to avoid, but sometimes in life, there is no choice other than to confront the darkness of night. You would think you do so with a blinding light, but sometimes it is only dealt with by cowering until the morning.

CHAPTER 1

I breathed in the fresh night air and said goodbyes to the Pastor. The chirping that filled the air was suddenly overwhelmed by my car beeping. I loaded into the car and took a moment to absorb the conversation. My wife, Edith, had caught an early ride home since little Isaiah had grown fussy about the event. Wish she had not left, though, since the Pastor’s speech had been brilliant, he told of the strength of faith and not turning away from your faith even when facing hard times, something I know she had dealt with in the past. Turning the keys in the ignition, the vast darkness had been illuminated. The car bumping against the gravel turned onto the country road, losing itself in the darkness, while I mindlessly started down the road, my thoughts capturing my focus rather than the road ahead. Everybody needs time to consider their day, actions, and who they are deep inside their mind, or at least I think they do.

I began to notice all of the environment, well, more so the changes of the old familiar country road I’ve been on many times before. The glowing white doves, which were new. Some trees had fallen, and new trees were beginning to sprout. All the greenery is forever changing, the feeling of life growing and decaying, beginning only to stop. The purpose of it all is what I desired most. Sometimes it feels fleeting, sometimes I feel fleeting. My pastor tried to illustrate that, but some things are not to be illustrated; they are just understood, sort of like God. 

I came upon a stop sign and noticed a deer in the background. As the wheels stopped rolling and the car’s motion halted, I leaned forward and squinted my eyes to ensure my mind had received the correct imaging from my retinas. In front of the headlights of my car, a deer was dragging a dead friend-or maybe a dead enemy-by its mouth. The head of the dead deer in the mouth of a predator deer, the skin pulled upward yet still looked stiffer than stale bread and tougher to chew than Laffy Taffy, though I assume the flavor was less than a sweet banana. This dead deer was missing two limbs, which were ripped from its body, which must have been cold for hours, as there was no fresh blood dripping from the wounds. The deer dragging the corpse then looked up at me, staring daggers down, and then dropped the corpse from its mouth. As the chills squirmed up my spine, I felt my eyes waver, but my brain refused, in an ego challenge with a cannibalistic deer. My eyes told my brain what must surely be incorrect. In three decades of life, I’d never seen or witnessed such a catastrophe of nature. The deer, still locking eyes, began to eat its fallen brethren and began by chomping at the head. I had my window cracked just enough to get fresh air, and even beyond the small creaking of leaves and branches in the night wind, beyond the bugs buzzing, I heard a loud crunch of the head. The crunch was louder than stomping on a leaf; it sounded like the snapping of a twig, yet the deer put less effort than that, like breaking a cracker in two. Desiring to see no more of a deer-eating deer, I checked both ways and sped away from the scene and toward home, like a grandma late for bingo night. Maybe it should be called bingo morning because they are never up at night.

On the fifteen-minute trip home, the thought of that deer had not left the cycle of my thoughts. Considerations were family, the church event, and that damned deer. The deer lingered around in my thoughts, a hunter that lingers around their target. Deer have doe eyes, yet this one had white eyes, not the normal black and brown I was used to. Pulling into the neighborhood, I was trying to shake the thoughts and focus on the speech that had stirred strong feelings of faith. Feelings that made me want to abandon all material and spread the word, a good sermon had that sort of effect. A good sermon can make you want to abandon everything insignificant, just as a terrible sermon can make you fall asleep in the front pew. I was rehearsing my words in the car; I wanted every word to be perfectly recreated, with just as much vigor and excitement, I wanted to cook the same exact perfect dish for Edith as the pastor did for me. As the key turned in the ignition, the car door opened to a cold breeze slapping my face almost as if I had insulted the air with my very presence. I felt my body shiver, not exactly sure if it was because of the cold or because of the image of the deer’s white and glassy eyes staring me down. Stepping out and locking the sedan up, I considered walking up to the house door and unlocking it, but instead, I hesitated and began marching over to my neighbor’s house. 

Hands, swollen from the cold and turning numb, slammed against the door of my neighbor. I needed to discuss it with someone who would be more sound-minded, who had experience hunting, and who knew about deer behavior. The door creaked open to a warm smile as a burly man greeted me. The burly man, not too much taller than I, but much wider, questioned why I had come to his door so late into the night, well past dinner and right near bedtime. 

“I know this sounds a bit silly, but I saw something on the way home, and I…” I began to question if I should be discussing something like this, before the burly man’s inquisitive face gave me the confidence to continue, “I saw a deer dragging another dead deer before the deer dropped the corpse and stared me down. I couldn’t see any emotion, but I felt such heat from its gaze,” Before I could continue, my neighbor chuckled. 

“You caught me shirtless getting ready for bed to tell me about a deer staring at ya? Man, life has surely been boring for you, huh?” I gave a nervous laugh as I realized I had ignored the style my neighbor was currently wearing: Long silk pajama pants, no shirt, two pairs of white socks that had grayed, and reading glasses that had now begun to fog up from the cold air. I reopened the conversation with a little more urgency to discuss what really freaked me out, “Well, no, it wasn't the staring, it was the fact that the deer stared at me while it ate the dead deer. The corpse was already missing two limbs, and now the deer was eating the corpse’s head, in particular, it was… it was munching the eyes.” Uncertain, my eyes lowered a bit and switched from nervousness to insecurity in my story, how ridiculous I sounded to my friend. The silence the neighbor left me in made my embarrassment rise before the wind was silenced with booming words, “Deer that eats deer? I’ve heard o’ that before, but not a deer eating the limbs and the head. Heard of them goin’ for the guts. That’s the real juicy stuff they go for, but I suppose it's not crazy for it to go for something else. But if that is all you got for me, I’m sorry but I’m goin’ to need to head to bed because I truly am exhausted,” The burly man’s large and frozen hand thumped against my back before I bid him good night and headed back over to my house. 

The key twisted inside the lock before the door swung open. I was greeted by Edith atop the stairs, asking me if everything was alright.

“Yeah, I, uh, I just had to ask for,” I clenched my eyes close and shook my head before getting back into the lie, “I had to ask Harry a question about hunting. You know, he asks me once or twice each year, and every year he asks after I got my schedule filled. I wanted to make sure I had it open this time.” I gave a faint smile and headed upstairs to a much-needed embrace from my wife. I walked up to the nursery and peered in to see Isaiah sleeping peacefully in his crib. Took a deep breath and worked my way through the nightly routine: Brush my teeth, change into pajamas, peer out the bedroom window before closing the curtains, and then read a chapter of a book. This night was no different: I brushed my teeth, changed into my pajamas, saw a beautiful night sky, and then began reading Matthew as I had just finished Malachi. Finishing my reading, I laid The Bible onto my nightstand and closed my eyes. Thoughts swarmed around in the empty abyss of my mind before the image of the deer recirculated. Soon, however, it didn’t matter as I was out cold.

That night, I remember a specific dream. Picture this: there is a dense forest, and a wolf is walking through it surrounded by all sorts of forest creatures. Following behind the wolf, it is hard to tell, but there is something long sticking out from its mouth, being dragged against the forest’s floral floor. The sounds of thudding against the floor, against logs sticking up, sound hollow. Eventually, the wolf finds itself in a clearing, bearing a circle of deer. Each deer turns and stares at the wolf before sprinting into the woods. The wolf stands upon a spot where the soil sinks slightly, finally dropping the item in its mouth. The dream’s view pans around as the wolf begins digging a hole, and the item comes clear into sight: A broken piece of the cross. It is part of the intersection, where the “T” is formed. The wood of the cross is all dampened and splintered, yet the wolf is not cut on the mouth from the shards, yet its teeth are gnashed and bloody. After the hole has been dug, the wolf picks the cross fragment back up, places it in the hole, and buries it.

The following morning, I awoke and went through a less important morning routine. I ate breakfast, brushed my teeth, and clothed myself for work. Preparing for “Lippy’s Magical Food” was only so exciting after five years, but I enjoyed the pay of being the manager of three chains, so I didn’t mind the boring aspects of life. One could say that when life is boring is when it is the best. I grabbed a coat and opened the door, a door that usually opened to a bright sky, my car, and a few other vehicles, but today brought a much gloomier scene. The weather was perfect, yet there lay in my yard three dead doves, each laid out in a particular manner. No dove had its head still attached, but rather in the center of the triangle that the bodies formed, and each dove had its wings pulled out. I stared blankly before walking to the car, attempting in vain to ignore the dead birds. My foolishness never ceases to amaze me even now.

CHAPTER 2

That sunny Sunday, I drove out to the Church, Edith and Isaiah in tow. The whole service might have been beautiful, yet my mind was dragged out of the service and into that dream, except there was no wolf, only the buried cross and the deer munching on its dead deer pal. The cross’s wooden fragments jetted out, old, splintered, and damp, meanwhile the deer’s eyes had less life or meaning than ever. The deer refused to break contact, and my head is paralyzed on the deer, yet my eyes could split focus on the deer and the cross. My head was too paralyzed to make a choice of which to focus on. I came to for a moment, Pastor Clarke was referencing the sermon on the mount, yet I can’t remember the next part, I just remember the deer transforming my memories- my vows to my beautiful wife were replaced with me praising a deer with white eyes instead. Clouds fill the eyes of the deer and my head, as it was impossible for me to go through a moment of my life without that deer invading; my son’s birth? Nope, a deer-headed human baby popped out while a deer-headed doctor congratulated me and my deer-headed wife. I sifted through more memories; first kiss? Not with a human, with a deer. My vows were spoken to a crowd of lifeless deer, a deer-chewing wife, and a pastor, a pastor who was missing his arms and a chunk of his head. The pastor had started to decay slowly.

I clenched my eyes and began to breathe heavily while my actual, non-deer-headed, wife glanced over at me and began a double-take as she realized I might not be okay. She leaned in for a whisper, “Are you alright? Something happened at work? Harry say something odd again?” That part about Harry is from a different time, he swore he saw Bigfoot, and I swore he saw a murder, but like I said, that’s for another time. She bounced Isaiah for a moment before she leaned back in, her breath touching my ear with grace, “Ya know, I always know how to make you feel better, that’s my favorite hobby, maybe when we get back I can give you a back rub and we can watch *Die Hard*,” silly woman, she had to know by then my favorite movie is *The Thing.* I gave a slight chuckle under my breath, shook my head, and encouraged her that not only was I okay, but that she should go back to the sermon. 

“Alright, but if you don’t want to talk with me, talk with Pastor Clarke.”

I considered that suggestion heavily and ultimately split ways with her so Isaiah could be tended to at home while I could be tended to by my Pastor. I let the rest of the people funnel out so that the building was absent minus the two of us, before I asked to speak with him in his office. The church isn’t exactly new; it is this old building with a basement and a slight balcony that can be reached with a ladder. The balcony is never used other than in decoration, but the basement is actually quite extensive. The damp wooden ceiling hangs a rather large light by a chain so that the congregation can be illuminated; however, the chain is old and rusty, so I make sure I sit away from it. The basement has a small pantry with some food, a fridge, and a shelf of wine and grape juice for the kids. It has his office, which I’ll get to, a small room for Sunday School that is decorated with some Jesus drawings of his arm outstretched, ready for embrace, a few dingy chairs, a rug that was white when I was a little kid but now is some sort of gray that makes me a little queasy and absolutely unwilling to put Isaiah on, and finally it has a beat down chalkboard that is more chalk than board. We passed by all this, plus a small and decrepit closet, to reach his office at the end of the hall and past a small turn. Pastor Clarke’s office isn’t much other than a desk, three chairs, and stacks of papers and Bibles. He has a small window set on the ground outside, and a singular poster that illustrates David standing against a menacing Goliath with a headline above reading, “ALWAYS FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT.” On the way there, we had just chatted small talk, asking about Edith and Isaiah, about his duties, but nothing serious. Once I sat down, examining everything for a minute, which included the peeling wallpaper, I recounted everything so far to him. He made me nervous because his face slowly contorted the whole time, at one point quizzically, and at one point with a frown, but the face he ended up with made me most worried. By the time I finished the story, Pastor Clarke had a smirk on his face, slight enough you might not notice from far away, but enough to worry me that he might have gone senile in his advanced age. He must have noticed my bug eyes because he chuckled and took an extended and deep breath before his mouth was extended so far open to speak that it looked as if he was attempting to shatter his jaw. 

A sudden boom aborted the tension in the air, “You know, sometimes we are tested by wickedness.” 

I waited for more, but when nothing else came, I pushed out, “Like Satan?”

He shook his head leisurely, “No, God tests us, it is Satan who is his vessel to test our strength against wickedness,” He allowed me to understand before patiently beginning again, “You, Alex, are being tested by something you may not understand, but what you must understand is that you are being tested. It is time for you to decide what man you are, what man you want to be, and what man your family and life necessitate you to be. You,” he stopped, licked his dry lips, and began again, “You are perfectly fine, but you must understand this is a fork in the road, and the decision is not ultimately mine. Just stay on a righteous path, and everything is fine. You will be tested in life, to your ability, now that… that is your \*Job,\*” he said not like an employment, but like the man’s name, which forced a chuckle from him,  “Now worry no more, hurry home before your family is cold from your missing warmth.”

I don’t know if he helped me, but I did feel slightly more confident as I strolled out of his office. Well, I felt more confident for about thirty more seconds. As I strolled past the closet, the Sunday School, and the Sunday School, and then the Sunday School again, and one last time the Sunday School before I stopped dead in my tracks. I stopped looking to my right at the doors to try to catch scenery and instead looked dead forward at a hall that I knew the length of perfectly well, which meant I knew perfectly well that I had walked the length of that distance I was staring at four times over. I looked behind me, and the corner to the Pastor’s office was the same distance it always was when you stood at the Sunday School. I turned to walk towards his offic,e and as I hit the corner, I was back in the same hall I had just turned from. Yet when I tried to turn back aroun,d there was a hallway longer than the length of my entire drive home. I tried rubbing my eyes, I tried sprinting, I tried jumping, skipping, walking backward, I tried holding onto the wall, tried it all. I kept walking the non-infinite-seeming hallway and stumbled upon a doorway that wasn’t the Sunday School. I peered inside and saw the pantry with a small Bible lying on one of the shelves where the cans of peas usually were. Honestly, fuck those peas, I needed that Bible, because at that moment it was my refuge. I began flipping through the book to find the verse I needed. As I reached the right line, I grabbed a loaf of bread, ignored the twisty ties, and ripped it open from the middle. I grabbed a piece of bread, popped open a bottle of grape juice, and recited John 6:48- John 6:58. I stuffed my face with that piece of bread and downed the grape juice as soon as the last words exited my mouth as a sign of desperation. I shut my eyes, turned away from the door, and frantically prayed that I wasn’t attacked at that moment. 

A chill sprinted down my spine before slowly climbing back up my spine as the door handle clicked and the door’s hinges creaked to life. The slow yelping of the hinges, the small breeze of wind the old oak door brought, and the feeling of a presence caused me to swiftly spin around and meet the eyes of whatever might cause my undoing. Instead of a monster, I was met with the eyes of a frequent churchgoer named Jared who looked at me and then peeked back out into the hallway. He returned his head to the same room and asked what I was doing. I did not answer as I threw a loaf of bread open from the middle at his chest and ran past him, nearly toppling the poor man over as I sprinted out of the Church basement, up the stairs, and ran to my car. I damn near leaped into my vehicle as my muscles and lungs clamored for any small bit of oxygen.

After recovering from nearly passing out, I rushed myself home, to where I still refused to give my wife any knowledge of these events. Edith was, however, hanging up a painting, she said someone at the Church gave us to hang. The painting contained Jesus in a white robe holding a feeble newborn lamb over a blue background. It sounds simple, but the menacing part was how whoever painted this had the Mona Lisa in mind because no matter where you stood, the eyes followed. It creeped me out, but Edith refused to let me move it or take it down, so in our foyer it stayed.

CHAPTER 3

After my shift on Monday, I decided to try to talk to Harry once more. I wanted to get a non-religious opinion after what had happened the day before. This time when Harry answered, he wasn’t shirtless and ready to go to bed, but rather ready to go hunting. I had forgotten to actually ask, even though I lied to my wife about it, so I had partially hoped when I saw him in hunting gear that I wasn’t going to miss his trip since I knew it would be brought up. 

Before I got a word out, he smiled and softly chatted, “Would you like to go huntin’?”

“I’m sorry, you threw me for a loop there, I actually wanted to talk to you about something before we circle back to hunting, if you don’t mind.”

“Oh, no big deal, but we can talk on the way to go hunting.” He gave a plastic smile, one even hard for a Barbie to make.

“Uh,” I stuttered for a moment before I found footing again, “well, actually, can we talk about the other day? I was at my Church and I-”

“I know just what you were talking about, and hunting would take out a silly deer-eating deer.” The plastic smile twitched away for just a moment as a grimace substituted it before the plastic smile returned.

“I don’t think a gun would stop this, it… it isn’t human or deer. It is something beyond that, I swear, you gotta believe me! If you let me finish my story, I was at my Church and-”

“AND A GREAT WAY TO DISPOSE OF A DEER IS BY HUNTING IT!” He shouted before he leaned in slightly, his arm having reached just beyond the door to grab his shotgun and sling it upon his shoulder. Leaning in, he whispered, “I know how to hunt. How to dispose. We should go hunting.” He whispered in such a calm tone I nearly had piss trickle down my pants.

Being so freaked out, I just said no once more and dropped any sort of questioning I had once possessed. I backed up a few good yards with my eyes locked onto his before I turned around and speed walked into my house, greeted by Jesus’s eyes. 

That night, I had multiple dreams; the first was quite odd. It started with this deer and other deer foraging for any sort of food. The deer with a mark over its eye was following behind its friend when the friend turned and asked, “Friend, spare berries, please.” Suddenly, the marked deer lunged at the friend. Gnashing its teeth, the marked deer suddenly began devouring its friend while its skin began fading, revealing a wolf under the coat of deer fur. The wolf devoured his faux deer comrade before grabbing some berries and his fake deer pelt as he returned to a small cave where he was hoarding all the berries in the forest. After he put his pelt back on to assume a deer, he walked back towards a group of starving fawns, all about to collapse from hunger. 

The second dream was less fictitious and felt more surreal than any second of reality could ever hope of accomplishing. I woke up in the woods, covered in soil and leaves. As I pulled myself up with a branch, I shook all the dirt off of me, realizing I was drenched in sweat. I can still to this day smell those woods, they reeked of spoiled milk, and the air was filled with screaming animals on the brink of death. I scanned around me and realized there were trails of blood all but one way, the way I decided to take. Each step only made each scream and smell louder and fiercer. Every time I walked past a tree, I saw a new wolf; they were compounding quickly. My walk through the rotten woods soon became a sprint when there were far too many wolves to spot, even in the dense forest of trees I was in. As I sprinted, I heard footsteps behind me, but I was far too fearful to look back, yet brave enough to creep my eyes down just enough to see my footprints, which were bizarre since my feet didn’t fit my footprints. As I took steps footprints were being created larger than my own. I saw a clearing in the woods, and as I got close,r the clearing became brighter, almost blinding, but the smell of sour milk and the ravaged animal screams became so faint they were almost history already. As I crashed through the light I fell into my own living room, drenching my floors with soil and sweat leftover on my shirt and pants. As I stood up, however, I started to smell candles. Old, unscented candles, and then smoke, I smelled smoke. I blinked and re-examined my surroundings, noticing why it smelled like candles; my home was melting like wax. The walls were drooping down, the furniture collapsing in on itself, the fridge leaking food out of it as it melted. I sprinted towards the foyer and noticed Jesus melting away before I grabbed the doorknob for it to melt in my hands, almost as if my own home was laughing at my feeble attempts to escape. Well, if the house was wax, then I could escape by brute force. I stepped back and set my shoulder first before charging straight at the door, crashing through and waking myself up in a cold sweat. I looked over at my beautiful sleeping wife before I got out of bed quite frantically. I don’t worry about waking Edith since she’s a heavy sleeper. I tiptoed into Isaiah’s room to ensure his safety and then headed downstairs to grab a glass of water after my perilous slumber. 

I sipped on my glass of water as I began pacing throughout my downstairs. I reached the foyer and looked up at the upstairs before I looked back down, but in the process, I caught a glimpse of something nerve-tingling. I stared for a moment before I dropped my glass, shattering the glass into a million pieces while also deconstructing my mind. What I saw wasn’t real, surely it couldn’t be? I was staring at a painting of Jesus, melted, just like in my dream, except there was one part preserved. Jesus’s eyes remained and they still were following me. I got ready to rip that shit off the wall when I heard a loud knock. I about damn near fell to the floor, because who the hell is knocking at my door at 2 am? I heard sprinting through the grass before I slowly approached the peephole and saw nothing so I took the chance, only after grabbing a knife. I sprang my door open only to find a package written in what was Harry’s handwriting, he had this sloppy style where his m’s and n’s were almost indistinguishable, as well as his i’s and l’s. 

The package read, “For My Lovely Neighbor :)”. I swiftly opened the package, with my front door still ajar, which I’m glad I did, even if it might seem idiotic. As I opened the package, there was a note and something wrapped up. I automatically unwrapped the gift to find a decapitated deer head, chucking it immediately into the bushes as I shouted, “OH HOLY SHIT!” I slammed the door and locked it, shivering and shaking before I remembered the note. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and reached down and grabbed the note. Unfolding it, the note read, “Hunted. Disposed.”

CHAPTER 4

Why didn’t I call out? Well, because bills aren’t paid on goodwill. As I left for work the next morning, I still said nothing to my wife, still hoping this was a mental break ora  secret prank by the town, I had hoped for literally anything else. Telling her made this real, telling her made her involved in this hellscape, telling her made me have to face the music, and right now, I didn’t want to be Jericho. I made sure I cleaned up last night’s mess. As I got into my ca,r I noticed a pair of eyes lurking from Harry’s bedroom window. As our eyes locked, he retreated behind curtains, only to peek back out a few moments later, like a small child poorly attempting to sneak around his parents. 

While at work, various weird things happen all the time, I mean, Lippy’s is not some high-dining establishment, it’s a frumpy diner, but it pays bills, so I never cared. What happened, though, was quite bizarre, and it started with one of my waitresses, Yasmine, she approached me all excited because even though her customer only got a coffee, he tipped her $12.90. She was nearly screeching, but you could tell she was working overtime to not cause a scene. Who gets that excited over a $12.90 tip? A waitress, who is underpaid and is saving for college, but pretty quickly her excitement was dampened when Wes, another waiter, came up with a $12.90 tip on his order. Two $12.90 tips on different orders is something a little odd, but when the next six orders all tipped $12.90 no matter the order or the waiter was when I was getting a little paranoid. All my staff were joking about it being some secret holiday or that the town all had $12.90 in change from a sale going on elsewhere in town, but I found no humor. Ready to break down, the shift could not have come to an end any faster, my mind racing with thought after thought and my world was spinning. Every single person tipped $12.90 that day, my staff was happy since most people aren’t getting $70+ orders so they were getting way more than they hoped for that day, damn near started a brawl for seats at one point, but I was a mess. I had tried to think about what 12.90 or 12.9 might mean, but I had nothing. 12/9 didn’t mean anything, and even though it wasn’t exactly far away, I couldn’t have imagined that it was significant in terms of the tipping. It felt like 12.90 was supposed to lead me to something else. 

As I pulled into my driveway from what certainly was the weirdest day of my job, I saw Harry. He was waiting by the side of my house, just by the driveway. Grabbed my stuff alongside his card from the night before and another card I grabbed, and got out of the car, 

“Howdy neighbor, wanna hear ‘bout the trip? Huntin’ was so-”

“Cut the shit. Why in God’s name did you give me a deer head? I mean, what the fuck, Harry? At 2 in the morning, too? Could’ve woken my bab,y you know?” 

Harry’s eyebrows ruffle,d and his head jerked back, yet that plastic smile from before hadn’t decided to take a leave of absence. He turned just a bit to the side and leaned in, with a sarcastic look and tone, “Lippy’s decide to start servin’ alcohol? Might have to head there right now and taste the new drinks.” I returned no look of humor before he started again, “Ahaha, don’tcha worry, drinkin’, and drivin’ is off the table. Can always get a lift. Maybe you could show me the new menu.”

“Harry, no, you gave me a deer head. I even have a note you wrote-”

“Now Alex, if they ain’t servin’ somethin’ on the side at Lippy’s, then are you alright? Bump your head, wifey givin’ ya stress?”

“No, no, no, you’re not going to trick me. You! Yeah, YOU! You gave me a deer head, had to get rid of that shit before it started stinking up my yard, but I kept the note, and I kept an old birthday card you gave me a few years back.” I lifted them into his line of sight, showing the note and the card, before I nearly gritted the rest of the sentence out, “These have the same damn writing. You’re not going to sit here and act like you didn’t give me this note and that deer head, especially when your ass keeps talking about hunting. I know it was you, I got the proof in my hands. And honestly, at this point, I don’t care why you gave me a deer head, but I know you did, and it is WEIRD. You’re asking me what’s wrong with myself, the fuck’s wrong with you? Deer head ain’t a funny prank, especially not at 2 in the damn morning.” 

Harry stood there for a second, soaking in all the words that just pushed past my teeth and out my mouth, before his plastic smile stretched up his face, his cheeks forcing his eyes into a squint. The elongated smile stayed as he suddenly turned around and started marching to his house. He had made it halfway to his home before my confusion halted, and I realized where he was going. I jogged back up to him and tried to talk, but he was ignoring anything that came out of my mouth. I decided maybe the only way to get his attention was to shove him, but as my hands tried to push into him, I realized the man weighed a brick building and his chest was more solid than an obsidian wall. By now, we had reached the front steps of his house, and I had given up chasing, instead, I watched as he walked into his house. However, when Harry opened his door, in my catching glimpse, I noticed that all his walls had begun to melt like wax on a candle. 

After dinner, my wife and I were settling into bed for the night when she suddenly asked about the painting, which at this point was trashed, “Where’d you put the painting? It was beautiful, I want to hang it back up.”

I stuttered for a second, maybe it was time, maybe all the weird things so far needed to be heard by her, for her safety. I just… I didn’t want to scare her. “It uh, it melted, and I know that sounds crazy, but you have to listen. The other day I saw a deer, on the way back from Church, not uh Sunday, but rather that event, Wednesday. And then I had some weird dreams, and in one the house was melting and then the Jesus painting was melted, and then I, I…” I rubbed my eyes, I realized how frantic and insane I was sounding to her. “Harry, he, he gave us a deer head, like still bloody last night, and I dropped a glass. There were also dead doves in our yard, and Harry was acting so strange.”

“Is that all?” I nodded my head in response alongside an, “I think so,” before Edith began speaking again, “That is, the lamest excuse you could’ve had for removing the painting. I saw you give it an odd look before, if you didn’t like it, you could’ve said so, and I would’ve moved it elsewhere. It’s too nice a painting to get rid of. Now, seriously, where is it?”

“I am being honest, all that stuff happened!”	“I don’t have time for this ridiculous shit, Alex! Isaiah keeps me up all night, it’s been a long day, and I am tired! Harry gave us a dead deer head? Really?”

“I also forgot, I got stuck in the Church, I had to say a prayer and eat some bread to get out of there. But yes! Yes, all this has happened!” Pleading this case seemed pointless by now, as my wife’s stern look refused to alter.

“You sound asinine-” \*THUD.\*

Suddenly, a rock hit our window. We both looked out and saw Harry, standing centered on our window, basking in moonlight, still with a plastic smile on his face. The silence in our bedroom was deafening as both of us realized what was in his hands. In one hand, he firmly grasped a deer head, maybe the same one from before and he yanked it out from the garbage, or maybe a new one, couldn’t exactly tell from here. The other hand though, was wrapped around a revolver, snub nose. The metallic silver reflected somewhat brightly and allowed us to see what was surrounding him. In our backyard was a mob of deer, all patiently watching Harry. It all happened so quickly, so I’m not entirely sure if Edith gasped first or after Harry pulled the trigger on himself, but I do know his body hit the ground after her gasp. The only two noises since the thud against our window were a gasp and a gunshot.

1mdtvl2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mdtvl2,An attempt was made,"My first attempt at etching. Certainly most of the gain here was knowledge. 

My goal was to make the etch a dark contrast to the edge (kind like how the glare of the last pic makes it look). That goal was utterly missed, but hey.

To start off, I cleaned way too thoroughly before putting the transfer mask on for what I wanted; I was counting on the edges lifting a little for a smoother effect. Good to know that stuff keeps a crisp edge I guess.

Several more scrub downs with acetone after mask applied (again, how did that film not lift when scrubbed over with acetone, I literally wiped the ink grid clean off) then into my Ferric Chloride solution.

Sat and watched the whole time which was about 45 minutes. Must've gotten some wires crossed in my brain because I thought the result would be darkened where it was etched. It kinda was, at least until I just wiped off the top dark layer of oxide after stopping the etch with my baking soda solution.

All in all for a beater knife, I think it looks OK. The etch did a better job getting rid of /masking the remains of the stubborn damage than flattening did, so I'm happy. I could always wire brush or sand it down and try again lol

I'm Wondering what effect a wire brush or very fine sandpaper would have on the etch (unless they all just remove it, I have zero experience beyond getting here haha)

What do y'all think? Any pointers on the best way to get darkened metal? Other things to try from this point? Lemme know! I was gonna try coffee etching next :)",2,1753942116.0,sharpening,0,1.0,False

They say that the seasons come and go. But why did the summer never seem to stay long enough, no matter how long it lasted? It was never too warm, never too bright. Just perfect. Summer was a time of happiness and life. I loved the way the sun's rays traced over my skin, the way it filled my heart with love and warmth.. Nothing like winter. I hate the cold. I hate the empty skies. When winter comes all the life in the world just seems to disappear. And every year the winter seemed to get longer and longer.

I set my coffee down onto the windowsill I gazed through. It seemed like the only thing I ever did as of late was to look up at the skies. The sun had began setting earlier than usual today. That time of the year. Again. One last glance out the window to take in the view of orange leaves, filtering sunlight through a broken canopy and upon my eyes.

Outside my home was a vast field. The most breathtaking meadow one could imagine. Tallgrass swayed from one end of the horizon to the other, with birds of all kinds gliding from treetop to treetop. Serenity. We chose our home well, but winter would come soon. And It felt like the right time to take my yearly walk.

Today was the last day I'd get to wear a sundress for a while, after all.

I hesitated to push the door open and let the cold winds in once again, but as I gathered the courage to I realised it was still somewhat warm out. The sky seemed less cloudy all of a sudden. I mouthed a quiet ""Thank you."" up at the setting sun before I began my journey.

The path I always took through the fields faded away once again this year. It was getting harder for me to see it, but it would always be there. I'd never forget it. I tread through the grass, surrounded by flowers. Damn flowers. They always made me tear up. And as I got closer to my destination the flowers seemed to spring up out of nowhere. Flowers, flowers and more flowers. Clouds had already begun to blot out the sun. But no rain would fall. Not yet. Not while the sun was still up.

Everywhere I looked reminded me of when the skies were bright and the oceans hadn't begun to freeze over. When the sun was still around and everything felt right in the world. When the trees were still green and the lovebirds still sang their song. A time when I could bask in the sun forever and snowflakes never fell from the moon.

The journey always felt so long. Every moment I spent trudging down this trail was a bitter one. Memories from a time long past lit up the corners of my mind. Of smiles left behind. And yet it always stirred something in my heart the way only the sun could.

Before long, I'd reached the end of the path. In front of me lay an ancient, gnarled and blackened stump. I thought it was ugly once. But over the years I'd come around to realising what made it so beautiful. I knelt down and traced my fingers over its rough surface, gazing lovingly upon it. Still etched onto its bark, now and forever more was a reminder of better days.

Memories of a summer long gone once again filled my mind. The sun was almost gone by now. Soon a dark sky full of stars and an empty moon would take its place. Yet the world felt warm as ever. It made me feel tired. I needed to rest. Gingerly, I eased myself down onto the stump with a sigh as the sun finally vanished from the horizon.

I glanced over to my right. There was just enough space for the two of us to sit. Yet it was It had been empty for years now.

The only thing that the sun had left behind was a bit of warmth on its surface.

Just enough to make me feel like it was summer all over again.

A cold wind slipped through the air, brushing strands of my hair away from my eyes as rain finally spilled from the moon.

Three years into her marriage, Norah Miller discovered a chilling truth: her seemingly devoted husband was actually manipulating events for a hidden purpose. Bruce Simmons had documented every word of his deep affection for her sister in his diaries.

""The system assures me that if Norah endures suffering ninety-nine times, my beloved Luella will enjoy a long and healthy life.""

His assistant appeared uneasy. ""Madam just survived a car accident; her injuries haven't even healed yet. This isn't the right time to think about...""

Bruce's tone was cold. ""She's considered a burden, even abandoned by her own parents. If she can secure Luella's longevity, it's actually a blessing for her. She's just a child, nowhere near as important as Luella.""

It turned out that the elevator failures, the acid attack—all those 'accidents' were orchestrated by Bruce himself.

Norah, grimacing in pain, attempted to sip her coffee but couldn't sit up straight. In stark contrast, her cheerful sister Luella was being fed oatmeal by Bruce.

He tenderly touched Luella's belly, ""When this baby arrives, should we name it 'Beloved Luella'? He will love you just as much as I do.""

Holding her own stomach in despair, Norah walked away. She called her biological mother, Scarlett Brooks, ""Mom, about that match you mentioned before—I’m ready to marry him!""

When Norah arrived at the wedding venue, linked arm in arm with her new groom, Bruce completely lost his composure.

""Host, the three-year deadline is approaching. Luella wasn’t originally expected to live past twenty-two, but you've been using the valuable points earned by winning over Norah to prolong Luella's life. Plus, you must make Norah suffer ninety-nine times within these three years. She’s utterly devoted to you; can you truly bear it?""

""She's an adopted daughter of the Miller family. They've provided for her for so many years. Extending Luella's life is truly a blessing for her.""

""The ninety-nine injuries are almost complete. How will you explain this to her? What if she refuses to divorce?""

Bruce relaxed in his leather chair, a faint smile playing on his lips. ""Before our marriage, I tricked her into signing an agreement she was unaware of. Our marriage only lasts three years and will automatically dissolve afterward, leaving her with nothing.""

Standing at the study door, Norah overheard this conversation, feeling as though she had plunged into an icy abyss. Cold seeped into every pore as her mind struggled to process Bruce's words. Her body began to tremble uncontrollably.

Norah and Bruce had grown up together; they married according to a family arrangement. Bruce was renowned for his devotion to his wife.

As for that Wagner family's monster... well, I'm willing to marry him."" Kairi Walker said as she began mixing essential oils.

She was a hypnotist, crafting a unique coffee-scented fragrance that helped people forget painful memories. Her clients ranged from heartbroken women to extreme sports enthusiasts haunted by their experiences, and pet owners mourning their lost companions. Yet, she never imagined she'd one day use hypnosis on herself. Her aim was to erase all memories of the man she had loved for seven years.

""Kairi, what exactly happened with Emilio Vasquez? After the hypnosis, you’ll completely erase him from your mind,"" Josh Walker asked, puzzled by his sister's decision.

Just two weeks earlier, Kairi had excitedly told him that Emilio had finally agreed to marry her. Josh had watched her enthusiastically plan the wedding, from choosing venues to fitting dresses and rings, genuinely happy for her.

Emilio was a chess prodigy sponsored by the Walker family for seven years. He was introverted, almost monk-like, living in a world solely defined by the black and white chess pieces. He had rejected Kairi's affections 99 times. As her brother, Josh had felt her pain as she always tried to break his icy demeanor, but it seemed she'd finally succeeded.

However, a few days later, Emilio was involved in a car accident on the way to a competition and claimed to have lost all memory of Kairi. The wedding was postponed.

""Emilio didn't lose his memory. He's pretending not to know me,"" Kairi said quietly, maintaining her composure.

She had overheard a conversation outside the hospital room, catching Emilio’s female apprentice planning a risky surgery. Afraid she wouldn't survive, she wanted a dream wedding beforehand.

""Emilio, your plan is brilliant. Pretending to marry Kairi made Liv Murphy break down and beg you to be her groom... Ugh, it's so corny.""

""She'll only have me.""

""Aren't you afraid Kairi will make a scene at the wedding?""

""Forget about her. She and I are strangers now. Speaking of which, isn’t she supposed to bring some of that homemade spiced honey cake again? Just toss it out for me.""

Kairi stood frozen, staring at the container in her hand, a wave of bitter sadness washing over her. Emilio wasn't naturally cold; he just wasn’t warm to her. Since he wanted to keep things distant, she'd let him have it his way! A man who had his heart set on another woman, she couldn’t care less about such nonsense.

""Emilio Vasquez is a piece of work!"" Josh's veins bulged with anger, containing his fury. ""Forgetting him is definitely the best choice.""

""Right."" Kairi had already deleted everything relating to Emilio from her phone. She held the coffee-scented fragrance and a pocket watch, opened the door to the hypnosis room, and stepped inside.

""Kairi!"" Josh called out to her. ""That heir to the Wagner family was severely burned in a fire a few years ago, with 90% of his body covered in scars. Although they helped us before, your happiness shouldn't be the price you pay. If you don’t want to...""

**Because “no screen” shouldn’t mean “no fun.”**

As parents, we’ve all been there—dinner is ready, the lunchbox needs packing, and your child is glued to a screen. Saying *“Put that away!”* often ends in sighs, sulks, or worse… a meltdown.

At **Mealhey**, we understand the challenge. Screens offer instant entertainment, but **real creativity and joy** happen when children explore, build, and connect in the real world—especially at the dining table and around meals.

Here are some screen-free activities that actually *work*—tested by parents, approved by kids, and perfect for South Indian homes.

# 1. Invite Them Into the Kitchen (Even for 5 Minutes)

Let your child wash curry leaves, stir rasam, or peel garlic. It’s messy, it’s real, and it gives them a **sense of purpose**.

**Quick ideas:**

* Sort pulses or masalas into jars
* Shape mini dosas or chapatis
* Smell and name spices—like a blindfold game!

# 2. Keep a Craft Box in the Kitchen or Dining Area

While you’re packing lunch or sipping coffee, let them:

* Make paper flowers or animals
* Draw their *dream lunchbox meal*
* Create “Thank You” notes for lunchbox surprises

Add stickers, washi tape, and a few markers—you’ll be amazed how long this keeps them busy.

# 3. Audio Stories While Eating

Replace video with **audio**—there’s a world of Tamil, Malayalam, or Hindi audio stories online that teach values, culture, or simple fun.

Try classics like:

* Tenali Raman tales
* Panchatantra fables
* Aathichudi explained like a story

It sharpens listening skills, builds vocabulary, and doesn’t need a screen.

# 4. Story Swap Over Lunch

Instead of cartoons while eating, try this:

**“Tell me what your idli would say if it could talk!”**  
or  
**“Invent a story about your tomato rice going on an adventure.”**

It may sound silly, but these spark joy and **build communication** between parent and child.

# 5. Make Food the Activity

Not everything has to be academic. Your dosa can be a moon, your vadai a spaceship.

**Meal-themed fun:**

* Draw your lunch before you eat it
* Give names to each sabzi and make a “menu card”
* Build a food tower with fruits or veggies before eating

# The Key: Make It Feel Like a Choice

Instead of saying *“No screens,”* say:

 “Do you want to make a chutney rainbow or play dosa chef today?”  
 “Shall we pretend you run a restaurant and I’m your customer?”

Let the **alternative be more exciting** than the screen.

1mdtpun,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1mdtpun/my_husband_gave_his_mistress_my_skin_and_freedom/,My Husband Gave His Mistress My Skin and Freedom,"After nine years of marriage, every time Carmelo brought someone home, he’d toss me a divorce agreement.

The 99th time he did this, his threats were as nonchalant as ever.

""Karla’s pregnant, so from now on, you're her nanny—on call day and night to cater to her.""

""Pregnancy is tiring; you’ll be making her coffee and giving her massages every day.""

""If you refuse, then it's divorce.""

In the past, I’d usually shove the papers aside, caving in to his unreasonable demands. But this time, I quietly signed my name.

Carmelo seemed stunned for a moment, then smirked.

""You’d better mean it this time. Don't come crawling back in three days begging me to change my mind.""

His overconfidence was unchanged.

But he didn’t know about my plane ticket for tomorrow.

This time, I was truly letting him go.

\---

Just after signing the papers, my phone buzzed.

""Did you sign the divorce papers? Remember, after we visit your parents tomorrow, we're meeting mine. You won’t back out, will you?""

""Too late now; the plane ticket is already booked.""

Imagining his voice, I found myself smiling gently.

Chapter 1  
  
  
Five years into their marriage, Aurelia finally discovered a secret-Caleb, the little boy she'd been raising as her own, wasn't hers at all!  
  
  
She stood outside the doctor's office, accidentally overhearing her husband Cassian talking with the doctor.  
  
  
""Mr. Thornwell, the kid's got a really rare blood type.His biological mother must come here ASAP.""  
  
  
Cassian pinched the bridge of his nose, looking exhausted.  
  
  
""Yeah, okay,I know. I'll... I'll figure something out.""  
  
  
The words hit Aurelia like a bolt of lightning, her mind going completely blank.  
  
  
Biological mother? But she was his biological mother... wasn't she?  
  
  
Standing there in the hallway, she slowly pieced together what they were really talking about.  
  
  
The man who'd promised to love her forever had been cheating even before their wedding—and had switched their babies!  
  
  
But why would he do this to her? They'd known each other since they were kids, grew up together in the same neighborhood.  
  
  
She'd given up everything for him—her job at the marketing firm, her dreams of starting her own business—just to be his wife and stay home with Caleb.  
  
  
When she told him, Cassian had actually gotten down on one knee right there in their kitchen, tears streaming down his face.  
  
  
""Baby, you're giving up so much for us. I swear to God, I'll never let you down. Never.""  
  
  
Those words were still ringing in her ears, but reality had just bitch-slapped her across the face.  
  
  
She stumbled back toward Caleb's room, feeling like someone was squeezing her heart with a vise grip.  
  
  
She couldn't even look at him now—terrified she might drag him off for a DNA test,afraid she'd lose it completely and make a scene.  
  
  
She turned and bolted from the hospital.  
  
  
Outside in the parking lot, her brother Silas was just getting out of his car. Seeing her rushing past, he quickly caught her arm.  
  
  
""Whoa, Aurelia! Where are you going? You look like you've seen a ghost.""  
  
  
""How's Caleb? I came to check on him.""  
  
  
Ever since Caleb got sick, their whole family had been freaking out. Silas had even blown off a board meeting in Tokyo and flown back on the private jet...  
  
  
Aurelia's eyes were red and puffy, tears already spilling over. ""Silas, I need you to look into something for me.""  
  
  
""Sure, what's up?""  
  
  
""Caleb..."" Her voice cracked. ""I don't think... I don't think he's actually mine.""  
  
  
...  
  
  
""Hey baby, where'd you disappear to? Caleb woke up asking for his mommy.""  
  
  
Staring at Cassian's text, Aurelia read her tears hit the phone screen.  
  
  
Every December, he'd take Caleb up to their cabin in Aspen for a week. ""Guy time,"" he'd call it. ""Father-son bonding.""  
  
  
Four years of this bullshit, and she'd never questioned it once.  
  
  
Now she felt like the world's biggest idiot. It wasn't father-son bonding—he was taking Caleb to see his biological mom!  
  
  
If she hadn't overheard that conversation today, she'd probably still be living this lie.  
  
  
Aurelia frantically scrolled through her camera roll—hundreds of happy family photos flashing by. The California sun was blazing outside, but she felt freezing cold, shaking like a leaf.  
  
  
Maybe she should've seen this coming. Men's promises weren't worth the breath they wasted making them.  
  
  
Being a selfish asshole was just in their DNA, especially guys like Cassian. CEO of a Fortune 500 company, movie-star looks, family money going back generations—he could have anyone woman.  
  
  
So he'd thrown her away like yesterday's trash. Her and her baby.  
  
  
But he'd sworn he'd never hurt her...  
  
  
It felt like someone was taking a rusty knife to her chest, carving her up piece by piece.  
  
  
They'd been together since high school. Everyone in their social circle knew how obsessed he was with her.  
  
  
When she was fourteen and some creeps from the school were hassling her outside the mall, Cassian had taken on all six of them by himself.  
  
  
He'd ended up in the ER with a broken nose and three cracked ribs, but the first thing he asked was, ""Good job?""  
  
  
At eighteen, when she forgot to text him back during a sorority mixer, he'd called campus security, her friends, even her parents.  
  
  
When he finally found her, he'd been crying harder than she'd ever seen.  
  
  
At twenty-two, he'd gotten his grandmother's engagement ring from the family safe—a five-carat diamond that had been in the Thornwell family for generations.  
  
  
""Marry me, Aurelia. I'll never hurt you, I promise.""  
  
  
The way he'd looked at her that day, like she was his entire world—so she'd said ‘yes’ without hesitation.  
  
  
She got pregnant six months after the wedding.  
  
  
Cassian had completely lost it with happiness, calling everyone they knew. He'd even taken a leave of absence from Thornwell Industries.  
  
  
""I want to be there for every second of this,"" he'd told her. ""Every prenatal appointment, every craving, everything.""  
  
  
His dad had threatened to kick him off the Thornwell family.  
  
  
The board members thought he'd lost his mind.  
  
  
But Cassian had stood his ground, even when his father called him a ""playbpy embarrassment to the family name.""  
  
  
Now she realized the truth—he wasn't trying to take care of her. He was making sure nothing happened to her pregnancy so he could pull off his sick little baby swap.  
  
  
Her phone buzzed with an incoming FaceTime call. ""Hubby"" flashed on the screen, and she wanted to throw up.  
  
  
She answered with a dead expression.  
  
  
Cassian's face filled the screen, still as gorgeous as ever, which somehow made this worse.  
  
  
""There you are! Jesus, baby, you look awful. Are you okay?""  
  
  
Before all this, she would've told him everything. Every bad day, every worry, every time someone looked at her wrong—she'd run straight to Cassian to fix it.  
  
  
Now she couldn't stand any sight of him.  
  
  
""Aurelia? Have you been crying? Where the hell are you? I'm coming to pick you right now.""  
  
  
Cassian was already reaching for his keys, looking genuinely panicked.  
  
  
""It's ok. Just grabbing coffee."" She was too emotionally drained to even pretend anymore. ""I'll be back in a few.""  
  
  
He relaxed a little, but his eyes kept darting off-camera. After a weird pause, he said, ""Okay, but don't take too long. Caleb keeps asking when Mommy's coming back.""  
  
  
""Yeah, okay.""  
  
  
Just as she was about to hang up, a hot woman walked into frame and casually settled onto Cassian's lap like she belonged there.  
  
  
Aurelia's blood turned to ice. Before she could even process what she was seeing, the call went dead.  
  
  
She sat there staring at the blank screen. Then she started hitting herself in the chest with her fists, trying to make the pain stop, but it just kept getting worse.  
  
  
He was with that woman. Right there in their son's hospital room.  
  
  
She buried her face in her hands, trying not to completely break down in public, but the sobs came anyway.  
  
  
This was what rock bottom felt like. This was what happened when your entire life turned out to be a lie.  
  
  
For about two seconds, she'd tried to convince herself that maybe Cassian was the victim here. Maybe some bitch was obsessing over him, manipulating him somehow.  
  
  
But he'd looked pretty fucking comfortable with her on his lap.  
  
  
Silas noticed her breakdown and rushed over, his iced latte forgotten on the counter.  
  
  
""Hey, hey... Aurelia, look at me."" He crouched down next to her chair, his voice gentle but furious. ""That piece of shit doesn't deserve your tears.""  
  
  
The tears just kept coming, leaving dark spots all over her white sundress.  
  
  
Silas looked like he wanted to murder someone. He rubbed her back awkwardly—he'd never been good with crying women, even his own sister.  
  
  
""Listen to me, okay? We're gonna get your real baby back. I don't care what it takes, how much it costs, or who I have to destroy to make it happen.""  
  
  
His voice got harder. ""And Cassian? He's gonna pay for what he did to you. But right now, I need to know—what do you want to do? Because whatever you decide, I've got your back.""  
  
  
Aurelia looked up at him through her tears and nodded. The moment she'd learned of Cassian's betrayal, she'd already made up her mind...  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
Aurelia spent the entire night in that 24-hour Starbucks, just sitting there thinking.  
  
  
She'd given up everything for Cassian—her job at Marc Jacobs, her own fashion line that was about to launch, her whole identity. All to play games with him.  
  
  
But she was still Aurelia Westvale.  
  
  
Her family owned half of Manhattan's real estate, and she'd graduated top of her class from Parsons.  
  
  
Even Vogue had been courting her before she threw it all away to be a wife and mom.  
  
  
So yeah, she was destroyed right now. But she wasn't done.  
  
  
She scrolled through her contacts and called her best friend in Zurich.  
  
  
""Elena? Remember how you said your company was looking for a new creative director? Is that still open?""  
  
  
There was a pause. ""Wait, are you serious? What about Mr. Perfect? Cassian would lose his mind if you moved to Europe.""  
  
  
""Well, that's not really his call anymore."" Aurelia's voice was flat. ""We're getting divorced.""  
  
  
""Holy shit, what?! Did he cheat? I swear to God, if that bastard—""  
  
  
""I'll explain everything when I get there. Can you send me the job application? I want to get my visa sorted ASAP.""  
  
  
After they hung up, Aurelia splashed cold water on her face in the bathroom and got to work.  
  
  
First stop: the NYPD. She filed a missing persons report for her real child, practically begging the detective to put it at the top of his list. Then she hired the most expensive private investigator in the city.

Two days of that constant, rasping breath outside my bedroom door.

It hasn’t left.

He—she—whatever the fuck it is, it’s still there.

It started on Tuesday. That stupid fucking forum.

⸻

The text popped up on my phone as I was half-dozing on the couch, half-watching reruns on the TV’s dead glow. Angie. My best friend. My anchor through every disaster life could throw.

Angie: A dance with Eros can bring you a life of luxury!!

I blinked at it, confused, a little amused.

Me: What is this?
Angie: IDK, found on reddit, great results, click it.

I frowned. Since when did Angie use punctuation? That weird little detail should’ve been my first red flag, but I shrugged it off. Curiosity wasn’t my strong suit.

I tapped the link.

A black screen filled my phone, a lone spinning grey circle in the center. It loaded so slowly I groaned, propping my feet on the coffee table. My apartment was quiet and heavy in the late-night dark, the faint smell of the Domino’s pizza I’d devoured earlier still clinging to the air.

Finally, the screen changed.

It was… a menu. Like a cheap mobile game.

Dance
Settings
Menu
Exit

A cold shiver crept up my spine. Something deep in me whispered don’t click Dance. I should’ve listened.

But I didn’t.

I tapped.

One single command appeared in big white letters.

Twirl.

I laughed awkwardly, stood up, and spun once in my living room.

Great job!

Another command.

Jumping jacks!

I sighed but obeyed, hopping in place, already winded from my warehouse shifts.

Then came the final message:

Last one!
Eros lumin ackro delsus

The words were strange, wrong somehow, like they didn’t belong in my mouth. But I said them aloud anyway.

The phone let out a piercing PING that rattled through the room. I jumped, dropping it onto the couch.

When I picked it back up, the screen simply read:

Congrats!
Luxury.

Then the app vanished. No history. No trace.

I texted Angie.

Me: This is stupid. Just made me do a bunch of exercise lol.

She didn’t reply for hours. I crawled into bed, exhausted, and was half-asleep when my phone finally dinged.

Angie: I’m sorry.

My stomach twisted.

Me: Sorry? For what?

The message went green.

She’d blocked me.

⸻

When morning came. My phone vibrated with a bank notification.

$10,000,000 has been deposited into your account.

I sat up so fast I almost fell out of bed.

“Oh fuck—oh my fucking god.”

Throwing on clothes, I didn’t even look in the mirror as I grabbed my car keys and sped to Angie’s house.

The street was eerily silent. Her porch felt wrong, the air thick like static.

“Angie!” I banged on the door, heart hammering.

No answer.

“Open up, Angie!”

The final pound made the door creak open. A smell rolled out, thick and putrid, like something long dead.

I gagged, yanking my shirt over my nose as I stepped inside.

The flashlight on my phone cut through the dark.

And I saw.

Blood.

So much blood. Painted up the walls, pooled on the floor, splattered across the ceiling until there wasn’t a clean inch of white left.

And Angie…

She was strung up by her own intestines, her body twisted and mangled like a grotesque marionette.

I vomited, collapsing to my knees.

That’s when I heard it.

A low, guttural growl from deeper in the house.

I froze.

The open doorway beyond seemed to swallow my flashlight beam whole, black and bottomless.

The growl got closer.

I bolted. Stumbled out the door, tripping down the steps, fumbling for my car keys.

By the time I slammed the door shut behind me, my chest felt like claws were sinking into my lungs. I barely remember driving. I just remember dialing 911 with shaking hands, my voice cracking as I screamed into the phone.

The cops came. Questions were asked. But none of it mattered.

Why me? Why any of this?

⸻

I took a week off work. I didn’t touch the money. Couldn’t.

The game. Angie’s body. The smell. The words.

I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

Then the lights started flickering.

At first I thought it was just old wiring. But soon the air in the house grew heavy and wet, like breathing through syrup. My reflection in the mirror became… wrong. Sagging, pale, my eyes sunken deep like I hadn’t slept in weeks.

I hated looking at myself.

Then one night, I woke up and everything was pitch black. The lights wouldn’t turn on.

It was so fucking hot.

I grabbed my phone, the flashlight trembling in my hands as I scanned the room. The walls looked… damp. Like they were sweating.

And then—

Exhale.

A soft breath.

Just outside my bedroom door.

I locked it instantly, heart racing.

The shuffle of footsteps.

And then my phone pinged.

Unknown: You played the game.
Unknown: You didn’t follow the rules.
Unknown: Didn’t spend the money.

I stared at the screen, shaking.

Me: Who the fuck is this??

The doorknob jiggled.

I’d never read the rules.

CRACK. The door splintered as something pulled at it, impossibly strong.

I backed up until I was pressed against the far wall, whispering over and over, “Fuck, fuck, fuck.”

⸻

It’s been days now.

I’ve survived on the stale snacks in my nightstand and water from the bathroom sink.

The breathing outside the door hasn’t stopped. It’s getting louder. Angrier.

The wood cracks and groans a little more each hour.

I don’t know how much longer it’ll hold.

I wondered how Angie was feeling in her last days. Did she ever think she would escape? did I?

# Best Spoons for Sugar 2025: Reviews & Buying Guide

The humble spoon, often overlooked, plays a critical role in our daily lives, especially when it comes to adding sweetness. This guide focuses specifically on spoons designed for dispensing sugar, evaluating various models based on material, design, functionality, and overall user experience. Finding the perfect sugar spoon can enhance your coffee or tea ritual, ensuring consistent and controlled sugar portions every time.

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal sugar spoon transcends mere functionality; it marries efficient dispensing with elegant design and durable construction.In this detailed examination, we dissect the core features defining a superior sugar spoon.

**Material:** The material composition of a sugar spoon significantly impacts its longevity, hygiene, and aesthetic appeal. Common materials include stainless steel, silver-plated alloys, and occasionally, handcrafted wood or ceramic.

The choice of material frequently enough depends on personal preference and desired level of maintenance. Stainless steel offers excellent corrosion resistance and ease of cleaning, making it a practical choice for everyday use. Silver-plated spoons, while visually appealing, require more meticulous care to prevent tarnishing.Wooden or ceramic spoons, though potentially adding a unique aesthetic, may be more susceptible to staining or damage and are typically less sanitary for scooping sugar.

**Spoon Bowl Design:** The shape and size of the spoon bowl directly influence the accuracy and consistency of sugar dispensing. Shallow, wider bowls tend to scoop a broader area and might result in uneven portions. Deeper, narrower bowls offer better control, especially when dealing with granular sugar or powdered sweeteners.

Consider spoons with a slightly pointed tip, which is excellent for reaching into corners of sugar canisters or bags. The ideal bowl size should hold a standard teaspoon or tablespoon of sugar, depending on your sweetening preferences. Some spoons feature small holes or slots in the bowl, designed to sift excess sugar and prevent over-sweetening.

**handle Ergonomics:** A comfortable and well-designed handle is essential for ease of use and prevents slippage, especially when handling powdered sugar or sticky substances. The handle should be long enough to provide a secure grip but not so long that it becomes unwieldy.

Materials like stainless steel or wood are frequently used for handles, offering a balance of durability and tactile feel. Ergonomic considerations such as handle curvature, texture, and weight distribution can significantly enhance the user experience.ideally, a sugar spoon handle should offer a secure and comfortable grip, even when the user's hands are wet or slippery.

**Weight and Balance:** The overall weight and balance of the spoon influences the control and ease with which you can scoop and dispense sugar.A spoon that is too light might feel flimsy and offer less precision, while a spoon that is excessively heavy can be tiring to use over extended periods.

The ideal weight will depend on individual preferences but generally falls within a range that feels ample yet manageable. The balance should be evenly distributed, ensuring that the spoon does not tip or wobble when loaded with sugar. A well-balanced spoon allows for precise and controlled movements, minimizing spills and maximizing accuracy.

**Finish and Aesthetics:** While primarily functional, the aesthetics of a sugar spoon contribute to its overall appeal and complement the surrounding tableware. The finish should be smooth and free of imperfections, enhancing both its visual appeal and ease of cleaning.

## Core Benefits

Beyond their basic function, the best sugar spoons offer tangible benefits that enhance your daily routine. From precision dispensing to improved hygiene, the right spoon can make a significant difference.

**Precise and Consistent Dispensing:** A well-designed sugar spoon enables you to measure and add sugar with accuracy and consistency. This is particularly beneficial for baking, preparing beverages, or any situation where precise sugar control is required.Using a dedicated sugar spoon eliminates the guesswork associated with using generic spoons or measuring cups,achieving consistent flavor profiles and minimizing needless sugar consumption.

The consistent dispensing capabilities of a sugar spoon are especially vital for individuals monitoring their sugar intake or adhering to specific dietary requirements. It also prevents the wasteful over-sweetening of drinks and foods, helping conserve resources and reduce overall sugar usage. Precision in sugar dispensing translates to better control over recipes and a more consistent culinary experience.

**Improved Hygiene and Cleanliness:** Using a dedicated sugar spoon prevents cross-contamination and ensures that the sugar supply remains clean and hygienic. When using a regular spoon,trace amounts of other food items or liquids may inadvertently transfer into the sugar canister,potentially leading to clumping or the growth of bacteria. A dedicated sugar spoon minimizes this risk by keeping the sugar supply separate from other ingredients.

Additionally, choosing a sugar spoon made from stainless steel or another non-porous material further enhances hygiene. Thes materials are easy to clean and sanitize, preventing the buildup of germs and maintaining the integrity of the sugar supply. Proper hygiene is essential for preventing foodborne illnesses and ensuring the overall safety and quality of your food preparation practices.

**Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal:** A stylish and well-crafted sugar spoon complements your tableware and adds a touch of elegance to your dining experience. The right sugar spoon can serve as a small but significant detail that elevates the overall presentation of coffee, tea, or desserts. Choosing a spoon that matches your existing cutlery or teapot and sugar bowl set creates a cohesive and visually appealing aesthetic.

Moreover, a beautifully designed sugar spoon can enhance the ritual of preparing and enjoying sugary treats. It signifies attention to detail and a commitment to overall quality, making the process more enjoyable and refined. Whether you prefer modern minimalism or ornate detailing, a sugar spoon should ideally enhance your personal style and add to the aesthetic of your dining space.

## FAQs Section

Addressing typical consumer inquiries can clarify any doubts and provide a more complete understanding of sugar spoons.

**What size sugar spoon is ideal for everyday use?**
A standard teaspoon-sized sugar spoon is generally suitable for everyday use.This allows for easy portion control and avoids excessive sugar addition to beverages. Though, if you prefer a slightly larger amount of sugar, a tablespoon-sized spoon might potentially be more appropriate.**How do I clean and maintain my sugar spoon to ensure it lasts?**
Regular cleaning with warm soapy water is essential for maintaining your sugar spoon. For stainless steel spoons, simply rinse and dry after each use. Silver-plated spoons require more careful handling and should be polished regularly to prevent tarnishing. Avoid using abrasive cleaners, as they can scratch the surface. Wooden spoons should be hand-washed and thoroughly dried to prevent warping or cracking.

**Are there specific sugar spoons for different types of sugar (granulated, powdered, brown)?**
While there are no specifically-designated sugar spoons for different types of sugar, certain spoon designs are more effective for specific consistencies. Spoons with deeper bowls work well for granulated and brown sugar, while spoons with wider bowls and slightly angled edges are more effective for scooping powdered sugar. Ultimately, the choice depends on personal preference and the type of sugar you use most frequently.

The crew members were already wiping their enameled tin plates clean with rough-textured hunks of corn bread, when the daily interchange train finally came in. The train had been restricted to 10mph because of the morning mist – the lone Class C-46 chugging along slowly with her 19 cars squealing and chuntering along behind. The switch crew had already been out to spot an errant box car left at the wrong end of one of the sidings at ‘Dills’, hence the later breakfast.  
  
The Cascade Falls Railroad has just purchased another locomotive for rebuild, to be assigned specially to the Connelly Creek logging line. So, to retrieve the old ‘Tank Mikado,’ today’s train will be a work train, including a baggage van as a tool car, and some of the return cars will be used for braking effort. But that is several hours in the future.  
     
Time to 'bread' those greasy plates clean, toss the coffee dregs out over the caboose railings, feed and air the fire and start working on the incoming train.",7,1753940327.0,UnofficialRailroader,1,1.0,False

1mdtdak,https://www.reddit.com/r/MWE/comments/1mdtdak/the_paris_blues_part_33/,The Paris Blues - Part 3/3,"*The match between Misery and Happy for the latter’s War Against Time Championship has been a war, with the French crowd being even more hostile to the newly-repainted Clown than usual, due to his atrocious attack on fan favourite Cactus Mike earlier tonight. This one is coming down to the wire with about a minute left before a time limit draw, but Happy is perched on the top rope, ready to deliver a devastating Coup de Grace.* 



*However, the crowd comes unglued as Still Tippin’ blasts through the arena! That’s Code Blue’s theme song! He’s not allowed to do anything physically, but that doesn’t mean he can’t cause a distraction!* 



*The Clown’s attention is on his rival, who surely must be here to avenge his fallen Ark member, Cactus Mike! He takes a bit too long to hit the Coup de Grace, and Misery moves out of the way! Happy crashes and burns, and Misery capitalizes, locking in the Black Velvet! She’s submitted countless opponents with this move, and they’re right in the centre of the ring! It looks like Happy is about to tap, we’re about to have a new champion! His hand hovers about the mat…AND THE BELL RINGS! Blue curses on the entrance ramp, Misery rolls over, deflated, and the crowd groans. Happy the Clown just BARELY managed to survive his way to a time limit draw, and he retains his title!*



*He has no interest in celebrating though, as he stumbles to his feet and charges down the ramp! These two aren’t supposed to fight tonight, but it looks like they’re going to disregard the decree set upon them by both Mark Steel and Apeirogone! Security cuts a path between them and desperately tries to restrain the rivals, but they’re pretty damn close to each other…*



*And the crowd pops as Apeirogone, the showrunner for BTE, appears on the screen! He looks like he hasn’t slept in weeks, dark circles around his eyes and piles of booking papers and crumpled coffee cups are strewn about his desk. He seems to be in his home office, and this is confirmed as big block letters appear reading “LIVE FROM TOKYO VIA SATELLITE”.* 



*A true pro, he waits for the crowd’s cheers to die down before pleading with Happy and Blue.* 



**Ape:** “Look, guys, throw me a bone here, okay? I’ve been up for 74 hours and counting, I’ve redesigned this logo like fifteen times today alone, it took me forever to figure out how to patch into the MWE big screen, and the last thing I need is for you guys to kill each other before the show, right? KILL EACH OTHER AT THE SHOW! IS THAT TOO MUCH T-sorry…is that too much to ask?”



“This is one of the biggest matches on the card, and this card is very close to my heart, so I’ll cut you guys a favour. I know this is a blood feud, and I can imagine that you want to inflict more pain on each other than a regular match can handle, so let’s just…not do a regular match, okay?”



*This garners another cheer.*



**Ape:** “As a matter of fact, let’s make it a HELL IN A CELL MATCH! THERE MUST BE A WINNER! THERE MUST BE A LOSER! THERE MUST BE FINALITY TO ONE OF THE GREATEST RIVALRIES THIS SPORT HAS EVER SEEN, AND THERE WILL BE BLOOD!”



*Both Happy and Blue nod enthusiastically, continuing to spout shit at each other, but without attempting to get physical.*



**Ape:** “Good? Great. Oh, by the way, a shit-ton of lawyers will be on my ass if I don’t do this, so y’all got a contract signing at the press conference too. Alright, I gotta go call Dude Wipes to see if they’ll put a big-ass shitty-looking ad on our announce desk at the show. Au revoir, mes amis!”



*Cheap pop acquired, and Happy the Clown vs. Code Blue is now officially a HELL IN A CELL MATCH! What a way to close the book on this grudge feud!*

1mdtcn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1mdtcn0/boss_the_new_secretary_got_pregnant_weve_fired/,"Boss, the New secretary got pregnant, we've fired her."" ""That's my wife!","Chapter 1 The Benton Family  
  
A woman in a white T-shirt and jeans walked out of the train station in Douburgh with a suitcase.   
  
Her delicate face turned slightly red as the sun hit her. She tucked wisps of curly hair behind her ears. Under her arched eyebrows were a pair of bright and pretty eyes, a slim nose, and Cherry lips. She looked so beautiful even though she had no make-up on.   
  
""Hello! You are Annabel Hewitt, right? I'm the driver sent by the Benton family.""  
  
Annabel nodded and followed the driver into the car casually. She was already worn out.   
  
On the way, the driver stole glances at the woman, whose eyes were closed as she rested in the back seat.   
  
This woman was Rupert Benton's fiancee.   
  
Rupert Benton was the most eligible bachelor in the city. At just twenty-one years old, he was already the CEO of Benton Group. He was way ahead of his peers. He was a vigorous, resourceful and no-nonsense person, causing many in the business world to be afraid of him.   
  
His grandfather, Bruce Benton, took it upon himself to find a wife for him. And he picked Annabel, a girl from the countryside.   
  
With his hands on the steering wheel, the driver took another look at Annabel's innocent face and clicked his tongue. He envisaged that she would have a hard time with the Benton family.   
  
At this time, Annabel slowly opened her eyes and looked at the strange city with a calm expression.   
  
The car arrived at the Benton family's residence soon. The driver carried Annabel's luggage for her.   
  
Annabel barely had one foot inside the house when a well-dressed woman appeared. She eyed Annabel from head to toe with a look of utter disdain.   
  
""Tracy!""  
  
""Yes, Mrs. Benton.""  
  
As soon as Tracy was given a signal, she began to spray the disinfectant all over Annabel.   
  
The well-dressed woman was Erica Benton, Rupert's mother. With her hands akimbo, she ordered, ""Her shoes and hair. Spray them, too.""  
  
Annabel's face and body were soon covered with droplets of disinfectant. The pungent smell made her nose a little itchy. She uttered coldly, ""What is wrong with you?""  
  
Erica flipped out immediately.   
  
""I heard that you're from the countryside, but I thought you would at least be well-behaved. It appears you are the same as the wayward and rude girls they breed over there. I'm doing this because I don't want you to bring any virus or bacteria into this household. Do you want us to get infected with whatever you are carrying?""  
  
Annabel is not a person who likes to listen to people's nonsense.. She would have walked out if she hadn't made a deal with her grandfather.   
  
""In that case, you should spray some disinfectant in your mouth because it stinks!""  
  
With this, Annabel shoved the servant aside and walked in.   
  
""You... Oh my..."" Erica pointed at Annabel with a trembling hand. Tracy hurriedly comforted her.   
  
In the living room, a girl who looked about the same age as Annabel was sitting on the sofa. She had on designer clothes and bright makeup. Her expression was more condescending than Erica's as she looked at Annabel. She was Rupert's cousin, Cathy Benton.   
  
""Are you Annabel Hewitt, Rupert's fiancee?"" Cathy rolled her eyes when she saw that Annabel wasn't dressed in designer clothes. ""Gosh, Grandpa has no taste. I can't believe he chose someone like you. Anyway, I heard you came here by train. You should have told us you are too poor to afford a plane ticket. We would have bought one for you. Wait, it seems there isn't an airport in the countryside.""  
  
Annabel looked at Cathy with one of her eyebrows raised.   
  
She wondered if every member of this family was so arrogant.   
  
There was indeed no airport where she came from, but her grandfather had booked an entire high-speed train to Douburgh just for her. These arrogant people had no idea that she traveled as luxuriously as someone who flew first class.   
  
Besides, she could have flown here in a private jet if she wanted.   
  
Annabel could easily make it clear to these people, but she didn't. She just went upstairs.   
  
Annoyance clouded Cathy's face once she saw Annabel ascending the stairs. She wasn't used to anyone ignoring her, so she followed her.   
  
""Where is my room?"" Annabel asked the maid behind.   
  
""Here!"" Cathy said, pointing at a door in the hallway before the maid could reply.   
  
She pushed the door open and added condescendingly, ""You have never stayed in a bedroom as big as this, have you? You should cherish it while living in here. I'm Rupert's cousin, Cathy. You should fawn over me if you...""  
  
Cathy had barely finished speaking when Annabel walked into the room and shut the door in her face. This made her angrier.   
  
""Ah! How dare that pauper be so conceited? What was Grandpa thinking?""  
  
The maid warily moved closer and asked, ""Miss, but isn't this Mr. Benton's room?""  
  
Cathy cast a scornful glance at the door.   
  
""Shush! Don't say a word to her. Rupert hates anyone being in his space or using his things. When he finds out that she's here, just tell him that she chose to stay in this room.""  
  
Cathy's eyes glistened with slyness as she spoke.   
  
  
  
Chapter 2  Night-long Cuddle  
  
Annabel didn't realize that this room belonged to someone else. When she saw that the bathroom was stocked with only men's products, she just assumed that the Bentons were trying to get on her nerves.   
  
""What an incredible family!"" she muttered sarcastically, walking under the shower.   
  
She only had to put up with this for three months. She had struck a bet with her grandfather. If she still had no feelings for Rupert after staying here for three months, their marriage would be called off.   
  
A maid brought in dinner for her once Annabel got out of the bathroom. She ate it and fell asleep almost immediately.   
  
It was already midnight when Rupert finally came back home from a business dinner.   
  
He was aware Annabel was arriving today. Bruce had told him to pick her up, but he refused under the guise of having many things to do at work. He had no interest in his fiancee. As far as he was concerned, the marriage would be canceled sooner or later.   
  
Rupert was fagged out. He managed to take a shower and went straight to bed.   
  
He was very drunk, so he didn't notice that someone else was in his room until he lay down on his bed.   
  
The large bulge under the quilt startled him. He moved away abruptly. The room was dimly lit, so he couldn't see the woman's face clearly. Before he could think straight, she rolled over and hugged him. She muttered, ""Teddy, don't be naughty. You should sleep now.""  
  
Rupert froze completely.   
  
This woman had a very familiar scent, just like that girl...   
  
It was soothing as his nose pressed against her neck. For some reason, Rupert found himself hugging her back. He fell asleep with Annabel in his arms.   
  
Strangely for an insomniac, Rupert didn't wake up at any point during the night. He slept like a well-fed baby.   
  
He had a dream that night. It was about what happened to him ten years ago. In a dark room, a girl embraced him tightly and said in a sweet voice, ""Don't be scared. No harm shall come to you. I'll protect you.""  
  
Later in the dream, he met that girl again. It felt so real.   
  
The next morning, Cathy woke up at the crack of dawn. She had been hoping to hear the news that Annabel was thrown out of the room once Rupert got back home. But the maid said nothing of such happened.   
  
Why was that? Didn't Rupert come back home last night? But his car was in the garage.   
  
Rupert hated anyone being in his space. He couldn't possibly have slept in the same bed as a strange woman.   
  
Consumed by curiosity and uncertainty, Cathy went to knock on Rupert's door. ""Hey, Rupert! Breakfast is ready. Don't you have a meeting this morning? You should get up now!""  
  
The noise woke up the two people who were fast asleep at the same time. Annabel immediately felt the warmth of someone else. Her head wasn't on a pillow but on a hard chest.   
  
She looked up, only to meet the sharp eyes of a man. She sat up immediately and was wide awake. ""Who are you?""  
  
Rupert's eyes darkened. ""Annabel Hewitt?""  
  
Since he knew her name, Annabel assumed that he was her fiance, Rupert. But why was he in her room?   
  
She was just about to question him again when he uttered, ""You came to my room and slept in my bed on your first day in this household. I must say that you are really something!""  
  
""What?"" Annabel looked completely confused. He just said this was his bed? How was that possible?   
  
Was every member of this family mad and troublesome?   
  
""Oh my!"" Annabel exclaimed as her mind went to the men's products she saw in the bathroom yesterday. It seemed Cathy had tricked her.   
  
In haste, Annabel got off the bed and looked at him coldly. ""Just to be clear, I didn't mean to sleep here. Cathy told me this was my room. No offense but I'm not in any way interested in you. come to think of it, I fell asleep alone. Why didn't you realize that someone else was in the bed when you got back? and why did you hold me in your arms for the whole night? Don't tell me you have a crush on me?""  
  
A look of embarrassment clouded Rupert's face when he heard her words. He couldn't deny that he held her in his arms for the whole night.   
  
Just like last night, he was stunned when he met Annabel's eyes.   
  
Her beautiful eyes were just like that girl's.   
  
Annabel squinted at him with a smile.   
  
""What? Why are you staring at me like that? Are you obsessed with me?""  
  
Rupert came to his senses. His face darkened again. He ordered coldly, ""Get out! And don't come into this room ever again!""  
  
Annabelle gritted her teeth.. She then left with her belongings without hesitation.   
  
This was their first meeting, but they already didn't like each other.   
  
Cathy, who was still at the door, was surprised to see Annabel come out.   
  
Annabel said with an ambiguous smile, ""Good morning! As you wish, your cousin held me in his arms and slept for the whole night. We got along pretty well. You must be happy about that.""  
  
""Nonsense!"" Cathy's face was livid. She didn't believe that at all.   
  
In her opinion, there was no way Rupert would like Annabel, let alone hold her in his arms for hours.   
  
But the fact that they had slept together for the whole night was plain to see.   
  
  
  
Chapter 3 New Secretary  
  
Annabel walked away with a fake smile.   
  
Cathy lost it. ""You bumpkin! Stop right there. I'm not done talking. Let me tell you, Rupert won't marry you!""  
  
Just then, Rupert walked out of the room.   
  
""Ermm... Rupert..."" Cathy stuttered, moving back in fear.   
  
Rupert's face darkened. It was obvious that he was angry, so Cathy didn't dare to say anything more.   
  
Annabel asked a maid to take her to her room. She unpacked her things and then went downstairs for breakfast.   
  
Erica, Cathy, and Rupert were already seated at the dining table.   
  
Erica began to criticize her as soon as Annabel sat down. ""Weren't you taught proper etiquette? Not only did you wake up so late, but you also didn't bother preparing breakfast. Do you think you're already the hostess here?""  
  
Taking a glance at Erica, Annabel said flatly, ""I'm not a servant either.""  
  
She would never make breakfast for this family.   
  
Although Rupert didn't say anything as the two argued, there was no denying that he didn't like Annabel either.   
  
The atmosphere in the dining room was tense. They ate in silence for most of the time. After breakfast, Erica held out a bank card to Annabel.   
  
""This card is loaded with about five thousand dollars. Buy yourself some decent clothes before going to the company. Remember to behave well. You mustn't cause any trouble for Rupert.""  
  
To develop the relationship between the two, Bruce proposed that Annabel work in the company as Rupert's secretary. Leonard Hewitt, Annabel's grandfather, agreed to the arrangement. She didn't refuse. After all, it was only temporary.   
  
Her new employment was no biggie for her, but the bank card was! It was obvious that Erica looked down on her. ""Thanks, but no thanks,"" Annabel said in a sarcastic manner.   
  
There was nothing wrong with her clothes, as far as she was concerned. They were specially made for her. That was why the Bentons thought they were not designer clothes. Without waiting for Erica or anyone else to retort, she went upstairs to get ready for work.   
  
She had just gotten into her room when her phone buzzed. It was a bank notification. The sum of fifty million dollars had been transferred into her account.   
  
A text message from Leonard came through.   
  
""Dear, I hope they are treating you well over there. I transferred some money to your account. Buy whatever you want. And don't forget to inform me if anyone bullies you. I love you.""  
  
Annabel smiled and texted back, ""Grandpa, I'm not happy here. They are bullying me. It's not funny at all.""  
  
Leonard replied almost immediately, ""Glad to hear that. Anyway, I'm going fishing. Talk to you later.""  
  
Annabel couldn't believe her eyes.   
  
Sighing, she changed into a professional suit and walked out of the house. The driver opened the door for her. As soon as she got into the car, she found that Rupert was also inside.   
  
""Didn't you say that you had no interest in me? Why did you agree to work as my secretary then?"" His charming voice had a hint of irony in it. There was also a smirk at the corners of his lips.   
  
""Don't get any ridiculous ideas just because I agreed. I promised my grandpa to stay with you for three months. Once the timeline expires, we will cancel the marriage,"" Annabel responded, glancing at him indifferently.   
  
""Huh?"" Rupert sneered. ""Aren't you worried that you will fall in love with me in the next three months? I guess you'll be reluctant to leave then.""  
  
Annabel was amused by his words.   
  
""Funny you, Rupert. You clearly have a swollen head. For your information, I will never fall for you. Get down from your high horse.""  
  
Although Annabel knew that Rupert was good-looking, that didn't matter to her. He had the repulsive character that she hated in men.   
  
Rupert pulled a long face at her words.   
  
She would never fall for him?   
  
""We will see about that, Annabel. Don't ever forget what you said just now!""  
  
In Rupert's opinion, Annabel was just playing hard to get. Why did she come to his home if she didn't feel a thing for him or wanted to be his wife?   
  
Annabel smiled and said, ""Okay, I'll keep it in mind. Don't worry. In three months, we will go our separate ways. By the way, we have to pretend not to know each other at the company. I don't want unnecessary drama there.""  
  
Rupert kept in silent.   
  
Unbeknown to Annabel, she couldn't avoid drama at work. The news about Rupert's engagement had already spread like wildfire. People also knew that his fiancee was from the countryside.   
  
The employees in Benton Group were in a heated discussion.   
  
""Guys, have you heard the latest? Mr. Benton's fiancee will work here. She will be his secretary!""  
  
""Oh my! I heard she's ugly. And that she's from the countryside. Since she's poor, she must have attended a substandard college. Can she even understand the documents?""  
  
""Ha-ha! You can say that again. The way I see it, she won't be able to operate a computer.""  
  
The words of the gossipers trailed off as soon as Rupert walked in with Annabel. Everyone's jaw dropped when they saw them.   
  
  
  
Chapter 4  His Superwoman  
  
""Look! Who is that woman that came in with Mr. Benton? She's so beautiful and elegant!""  
  
""Wow! Her legs are so straight and thin! I have never seen anyone as beautiful as her!""  
  
""Is she Mr. Benton's fiancee?""  
  
""How is that possible? It can't be!""  
  
Many of the employees began to wonder who Annabel was. The most common guess was that she was a business partner. But when she left Rupert and went into the personnel department to sign in, they all realized who she was. The news spread in the company in no time.   
  
It turned out that the woman who came in with Rupert was Annabel.   
  
People didn't know what to believe anymore. Didn't they say that Annabel was an ugly bumpkin? How come she was drop-dead gorgeous?   
  
While Annabel was going over the necessary formalities, the employees in the secretarial department were gossiping about her.   
  
""Annabel is so beautiful! She's even prettier than Heather Norman!"" an employee commented.   
  
Nina Jones, the head of the department, had a frown on her face and disdain in her eyes. She said maliciously, ""Looks aren't everything. Beauty doesn't change the fact that she's a poor village girl who doesn't know anything about city life. She's not worthy enough to be Mr. Benton's wife.""  
  
Annabel had just walked into the secretarial department when she heard these words. A hint of irony flashed in her eyes. She retorted in a clear voice, ""If I'm not worthy enough to be his wife, who is? You?""  
  
Nina's face froze. She looked away and didn't dare to retort. She couldn't afford to offend Annabel.   
  
""Ahem! Mr. Benton earlier told me to treat you like every other person in this department. You will receive a fair amount of work despite your status. Here is the document about the advertisement the company is going to shoot today. It's yours to handle.""  
  
With a sneer, Annabel took the document and left.   
  
The others surrounded Nina again.   
  
""Nina, is it Marcel's shoot? Annabel is new. Don't you think she will screw it up?""  
  
A spark of mischief shone in Nina's eyes. The face of the advertisement was Marcel Brooks—a young and bad-tempered celebrity. He was hard to please and work with. People always avoided him. She looked forward to seeing Annabel mess things up on her first day.   
  
As soon as Annabel got out, she went through the document that outlined the process of the advertisement. She raised her eyebrows when she saw Marcel's name in there; it was familiar.   
  
In the CEO's office, Rupert's assistant asked him, ""Nina Jones handed over Marcel's shoot to Miss Hewitt just now. Should I order someone to replace her?""  
  
Marcel's elder brother was a friend of Rupert's since childhood. Everyone knew that Marcel had a bad temper. It went without saying that Annabel would suffer a lot at his hands if she worked with him today.   
  
Remembering what Annabel said to him this morning, Rupert finally replied, ""No, let her do it.""  
  
He would take delight in her suffering.   
  
The company was in charge of everything for the shoot. Annabel and some employees went downstairs to welcome Marcel.   
  
A few minutes passed before a black Bentley drove into Benton Group's premises. Marcel got out wearing a pair of sunglasses. At the age of nineteen, he already had millions of fans all over the world. His fame contributed to his arrogance. He held his head up high and walked like he owned the place.   
  
Annabel walked up to him and extended her hand for a handshake. ""Welcome, Mr. Brooks. I'm Annabel Hewett, the person in charge of the shoot. It's my pleasure to meet you.""  
  
Marcel didn't take her hand or exchange pleasantries. He just complained with a frown, ""It's so hot. Why didn't you bring an umbrella? Anyway, is everything all set? I don't have time to waste. By the way, buy me a cup of coffee before we begin anything. Don't get me a cheap one. I want one from that cafe downtown. They make the best...""  
  
Marcel's words trailed off when he finally looked at the woman's face. His jaw dropped.   
  
""Holy moly! Annabel! Am I dreaming?""  
  
Marcel took off his sunglasses and still looked incredulous.   
  
He hugged Annabel excitedly.   
  
""Annabel? Why are you here? You work here? When did that happen? Shouldn't you be traveling around the world now?""  
  
Annabel stroked Marcel's head and said with a smile, ""Marc, long time no see. What did you say you wanted to drink again?""  
  
""Nothing! I didn't say anything. What would you like to drink? I can get it for you.""  
  
Everyone present was dumbfounded, to say the least.   
  
The ever-so-arrogant Marcel not only hugged Annabel but was also speaking to her politely. He even allowed her to stroke his head.   
  
Was this really Marcel or some clone who was passing off as him?   
  
Could it be that he was so respectful because Annabel was Rupert's fiancee? But he was usually arrogant in Rupert's presence. What was going on?   
  
The truth was that Annabel and Marcel met two years ago.   
  
At that time, Marcel was seventeen. He was filming in the countryside, very close to Annabel's home.   
  
Some thugs kidnapped him. Fortunately, Annabel saved him by chance.   
  
Marcel had fearfully watched her beat up the kidnappers so easily. He had thought he was going to die in captivity, but she had come to his rescue like a superwoman.   
  
She had invited him to her home. Much to his surprise, her home was even bigger than the mansion in Downton Abbey.   
  
It turned out that she was not only kind but also well-to-do. He couldn't help but hold her in high esteem.   
  
  
  
Chapter 5  Chivalrous Lad  
  
The two walked into Benton Group. And the shooting went on smoothly.   
  
Some of the clothes weren't up to Marcel's taste. He complained about them. But when Annabel said that they were good, he immediately changed his opinion.   
  
He set aside his nitpicking attitude just because of her. Whenever he went out of line, Annabel's glance brought him to order.   
  
Marcel was intimidated by her. Asides from the fact that he respected her for saving his life, he feared that she would spank him if he annoyed her.   
  
It was estimated that the shoot would take five hours because of Marcel's attitude, but it took only two hours.   
  
Once it ended, Marcel pulled Annabel and said, ""Let's go. We have a lot of catching up to do. I'll treat you to dinner.""  
  
""No, I can't. I'm not off duty yet!"" Annabel refused him coldly.   
  
Some of the employees were still on the set. They pretended to be busy, but they gossiped about the two on the spot.   
  
""What? Marcel offered to buy Annabel dinner but she turned him down.""  
  
""Holy moly! What is she thinking? Doesn't she know who he is? Many girls would jump at the offer. How can she be so arrogant?""  
  
""I wish he could take me instead. I can quit my job just to spend some time with him. Oh, Annabel is so foolish.""  
  
Being rejected, Marcel wanted to cry. After thinking for a while, he asked, ""By the way, why did you start working here? Oh my! Did your family go bankrupt? If so, I can support you. You don't have to slave away here, okay?""  
  
Annabel rolled her eyes and said, ""You know nothing, Marc. Now if you will excuse me...""  
  
She then went back to work.   
  
Everyone who saw the scene thought Marcel would storm out in a fit of pique. To their greatest surprise, he smiled helplessly and went to the lounge to wait for Annabel until she got off work.   
  
By closing hour, Rupert walked out of his office and said to Annabel, ""Grandpa made a reservation at a restaurant. Let's go have dinner there.""  
  
Rupert didn't want to, but Bruce threatened him. The man was hospitalized earlier after having a heart attack. On video call, he said, ""You must go. If you don't, I'll pull the plug on this ventilator. Do you want me to die?""  
  
Rupert's hands were tied, so he had to agree.   
  
Annabel was about to reply when Marcel came in.   
  
""Annabel, you are off duty now, right? Can we have dinner now?""  
  
It wasn't until Rupert coughed slightly that Marcel noticed his presence.   
  
""You are here, Rupert!"" he exclaimed.   
  
Did Annabel and Marcel know each other? Rupert looked at the two in confusion.   
  
Annabel, who had been silent, finally spoke. ""How about we all have dinner together?""  
  
In the end, the three of them went to the restaurant that Bruce reserved earlier.   
  
During the ride, Marcel kept talking to Annabel, who replied in a friendly way from time to time.   
  
When they arrived, Marcel became chivalrous. He opened the door for Annabel and even pulled a chair for her. He also put food on her plate and poured her a glass of red wine.   
  
Rupert was relegated to the background. It was as if these two were in their own world, and he was just there to watch them.   
  
""By the way, you still haven't told me why you decided to work in Benton Group. Is there something between you and Rupert?""  
  
Marcel suspected that they were involved with each other. ",1,1753940242.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

Until I have met SF Tirze! So I’m sharing my journey and some of the experiences I had and expectations para sa mga baguhan

I’m no doctor or expert. I’ve been using this since Feb. Eto ay pawang experience ko at mga personal anecdotes

SW - 84kg Height - 5’4 CW - 52kg GW - 50 kg

Things I’ve tried (puro budowl or muntik na ko maospital) and side comments ko sknila

1.	⁠Fitgum ( Naka limang bote ako ) - waeffect 
2.	⁠Lishou (buwis buhay Eto muntik na maospital)
3.	⁠Zen de shou ( d ako makatulog ng 3days straight pumayat nga ng onti Pero Yong mukha ko mukhang nagS**b*
4.	⁠Spirulina (mapakla na wala pang effect)
5.	⁠Edmarc slimming coffee (palipitations inabot ko)
6.	⁠Barley (more dumi more fun Pero walang na loose Nakailang packs din ako)
7.	⁠Japan pink pills (nag loose 2kgs tapos bumalik x2 pa when I stopped kasi naubos sa supplier)
8.	⁠Biguerlai (jusko nasa cr ako halos maghapon)
9.	⁠Kankura at Kangkunis (dry skin, walang lost weight)
10.	⁠Slimming coffees (lahat na ata 4x a day pa ko nagtitake walang naloose)
11.	⁠Yong mga non invasive na treatments (RF, Lipo laser, EMS, jusko ke mamahal lahat! Walang naloose)
12.	⁠LCIF (nag subscribe at bayad pa ko don sa coach sa Facebook at May pag meal prep, waley din. Wala ko naloose)

How tirze works :

1.	⁠It signals our brains na busog na Tayo
2.	⁠Slow down our food movement so we feel full longer
3.	⁠Lack of appetite (Kahit fave food ko, kagat lsng Kaya ko)

Side effects I had :

1.	⁠Nausea
2.	⁠Pagod (it could also be because I work 12-14hrs a day)
3.	⁠Constipation
4.	⁠Antok

How I managed :

1.	⁠Hydrate ng maraming tubig and electrolytes
2.	⁠Protein intake (pati protein shakes)
3.	⁠I take it at night or early morning (I work til 3-4am) Basta before I go to bed

My improvements :

1.	⁠1st 2 weeks, wala masyado na loose na weight but I feel less bloated. So I dosed up and less days
2.	⁠3rd - 4th week, braso ko nauna ng lumiit, tyan ko d gaano Pero nag loose ako ng 4kgs
3.	⁠5th-6th week, less bloated, super walang gana kumain and my weightloss is visible na, lost 6kgs na.
4.	⁠7th week, people are starting to tell me, pumapayat ako
5.	⁠8th week, total of 10kgs lost
6.	⁠All throughout my journey regular na ang mens ko!

Changes I did while on tirze :

NONE. I didn’t exercise, I didn’t plan meals or Diet. Mawawala kasi tlga gana at all. But I had to eat small meals a day. Half a cup of rice and more ulam. D ko pa nauubos minsan

My dosage : I started with 2.5mg and supposedly sa 5th week pa ang dose up ko, but I did dose up on my 3rd week to 5mg. And I stayed at 5mg until now.

My advise to fellow dreamers:

1.	⁠Injectable sya yes, Pero d sya yong iniisip byong injection na masakit at risky. The needle is too thin and sa fatty area ka magiinject so di sya ramdam
2.	⁠Wag madaliin ang process, we got fat and accumulated these fats over the years, so wag tayong magmadali. I saw others na hello 30mg agad Kahit first timer. Baka maging kwento kayo nyan.
3.	⁠There are non scale victories, pwede lumiliit yong body natin, nagiging regular ang menstruation, braso, legs, face lumiliit. Iba iba tayo ng intake. I have a very unhealthy lifestyle—I smoke I drink I sleep 5hrs a day I drink coffee
4.	⁠1 vial is good for 5-6 weeks (for beginners) the higher ur dose, mas iiksi syempre.
5.	⁠Find a good supplier, good support system, and most importantly yong May legitimate COA!

1mdt9cr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1mdt9cr/leaving_you_bereft_after_four_years_of_marriage/,Leaving You Bereft | After Four Years Of Marriage,"After four years of marriage, before the seven-year itch could even kick in, Julian Ziegler already had a mistress.

At the gate of an upscale villa in Brindlewood, Willow Harper sat quietly in the backseat of an expensive car, watching her husband sneak around with another woman.

The woman was young. Dressed in a white dress, she looked innocent and enchanting.

They held hands like lovers, and Julian wore a tenderness Willow had never seen.

The woman tilted her head up and playfully pouted at Julian. ""My feet hurt. Carry me, Julian!""

Willow thought Julian would refuse. After all, he was known for being a cold, unapproachable man with a short temper. No matter how much he indulged his lover, he'd never tolerate that kind of fuss.

But the next moment, Willow was slapped in the face.

Julian gently rubbed the woman's delicate nose, looking both aloof and tender. Then, he picked her up effortlessly, cradling her in his arms as though she were the rarest of treasures.

The woman's soft hands instinctively slid around the back of his neck. Her fingers lightly traced his hair.

There was a cherry angioma on Julian's neck, which looked seductive and felt sensitive to the touch.

Willow had once accidentally brushed against it in bed, and Julian had turned wild. He pinned her arms down and thrust into her, hard.

Sure enough, Julian couldn't control himself. He pushed the woman against a pillar in the gazebo with an intense gaze.

Willow shut her eyes, unwilling to watch any longer.

She had never seen Julian like this—so wild with passion.

So, what did that make her?

Before they married, Julian had actively pursued her, saying, ""Willow, you're the perfect partner for me in this world of power and prestige.""

That one sentence made Willow abandon her love for art. She threw herself into marrying Julian and plunged headfirst into the world of business, like a moth to the flame, consumed by passionate love.

In four years, Julian had seized control of the Ziegler family.

Since then, Willow had become a dispensable pawn. He found her too proper and lacking in femininity, so he kept a mistress on the side.

Willow blamed herself for being so naive. She was such a joke.

…

When she opened her eyes again, she felt nothing but indifference.

Love was gone, so now it was about the money.

The villa where Julian met his lover was their joint marital property.

Willow didn't want to let this shameless couple have it. She quietly asked her secretary, Annie Hudson, in the front seat, ""Has Julian been with her for the past three months?""

Annie answered immediately, ""The woman's name is Catherine Burke. She's Mr. Ziegler's childhood sweetheart, though not very bright. Three months ago, Mr. Ziegler pushed through objections and arranged for her to join his company, keeping her well protected.""

She handed a stack of documents to Willow.

Willow skimmed through them. She felt like she could make way for Catherine.

As long as Julian was willing to split the joint property, she'd take her share and leave, with no second thoughts.

Outside, the autumn leaves were golden. The setting sun cast a golden glow. It looked dazzling and bright.

Willow steadied her emotions and dialed Julian's number. He was probably still having fun with Catherine, as the phone rang several times before he picked up.

His tone was cold and aloof when he answered. ""What is it?""

Willow lowered her eyes. ""It's my birthday today. Are you coming home for dinner?""

There was a long silence on the other end.

Julian didn't want to come home. Of course, he could make up any excuse to avoid it—another engagement he couldn't miss.

But Willow could clearly hear Catherine's voice on the other end. She was calling him, ""Are you done yet, Julian? Don't talk to her.""

Julian hesitated. After a moment, he awkwardly replied, ""If there's nothing else, I'm hanging up now.""

The sound of the phone disconnecting followed.

This was typical Julian—always decisive and never dragging things out.

Annie shouted angrily, ""Mr. Ziegler's too much! He actually forgot!""

But Willow didn't mind.

Oh, it really was a shame that Julian's sweet time with Catherine was interrupted by her! But what could they do about it, anyway? Willow was the legal wife, after all. If she was upset, then she'd make sure to rain on Julian and Catherine's parade as well.

Willow smiled faintly. ""He hasn't forgotten. He just doesn't care. Annie, call and have the electricity, water, and gas shut off at that villa. He'll come home then.""

Annie couldn't help but say, ""You're really smart, Ms. Harper.""

Willow didn't respond. She turned her face toward the window and stared at the outside world.

The setting sun painted the sky in gold, and the evening clouds gathered in a tranquil embrace.

She clearly remembered that on an evening just like this, with the sky painted in crimson, she had asked Julian if their marriage contract was for life and if they would never betray each other.

Julian had said yes, that Willow was the most important person to him.

But now, he made her feel like money was all that mattered.

A single tear slipped down Willow's cheek…

…

Willow returned to Grandview Manor.

Half an hour later, Annie brought in the divorce papers. Willow was asking for half of the joint assets.

After a bath, she was already dressed, but something made her turn back to the mirror. She slipped off her bathrobe and examined her figure under the bright crystal lights.

Her body, worn from years of hard work, was naturally not plump. Thankfully, her smooth skin made her give off an air of cool elegance.

But it was clear that she wasn't alluring enough for Julian. Otherwise, why would he be looking elsewhere?

Suddenly, Willow thought of Catherine and even imagined Julian in bed with her. How intense it must have been. It must be far more passionate than when he was with her.

She frowned slightly, feeling embarrassed by her comparison.

Just then, the closet door creaked open.

Julian was back.

He stood at the door of the closet.

His tall, lean figure was wrapped in a luxury black shirt and pants. His chiseled features glowed under the bright lights, exuding the charm of a mature man.

Willow couldn't help but think that even without his vast fortune, his looks alone would make countless women eager to have a fling with him.

She had slept with him for four years. To some extent, her marriage wasn't that bad.

The couple exchanged a glance and said nothing.

Julian walked slowly into the closet and stooped behind Willow as they both looked at their reflections in the mirror. Willow had already gathered her clothes, and her hair was neatly tied up. Even her post-bath look radiated a strong, capable woman.

Julian clearly remembered that on their wedding night, Willow was still somewhat fragile. She trembled with fear at the sight of his body.

But that night, nothing had happened.

Two weeks later, after a business mishap, Willow had curled up in his arms, whispering his name. He had hugged her tightly. That night, they had truly become husband and wife.

Their bed life had been sparse.

At home, Willow was the dignified Mrs. Ziegler; at Nebula Group, she was a powerful executive. She always wore an unapproachable mask, cold as ice.

Even in bed, Julian would say Willow had never truly let go and enjoyed it.

After some time, he found it boring.

Julian leaned in and teased, ""You had the electricity and water shut off at the villa, didn't you? You're upset because I'm taking care of a respected elder's daughter?""

Willow stared at him in the mirror.

Julian knew it was her ovulation period.

He gently caressed her earlobe, his voice low as he murmured, ""Was it for your birthday or your physiological needs? Mrs. Ziegler, you're just 26 and already so demanding, huh?""

His words were crude, but Willow knew what he was after.

He wanted a child.

Julian's grandfather, Dominic Ziegler, still held 10% of Nebula Group's shares. Julian needed an heir to gain more leverage.

But what Julian didn't know was that having a child would be difficult.

During that accident, when Willow had pushed Julian away, she'd been violently kicked in the abdomen. This reduced her chances of having a baby.

Willow gently closed her eyes to hide the pain.

But Julian seemed unusually eager.

He easily picked her up, carried her to the large, soft bed in the master bedroom, and quickly pinned her down.

But Willow wasn't willing.

She pressed her hand against his chest, her hair partially undone and spilling across the white pillow. Her bathrobe was slightly loosened. ""Julian!""

Julian, however, couldn't take his eyes off her face. His gaze was feverish as he leaned down to kiss her. His body was already poised and ready.

Chapter 2

Willow clenched the bedsheet. Her fingertips left behind a mess of wrinkles.

Even at a time like this, she found herself wondering if Catherine didn't satisfy Julian. Otherwise, why would he bother wasting time kissing her tonight instead of going straight to the point?

Willow felt nothing other than disgust.

So, she simply lay there like a plank, letting him do whatever he wanted. No matter how hard he tried, he wasn't getting a child out of her anyway.

At first, Julian was aroused by the seductive Willow in her loosened bathrobe. But now, she just lay there like a lifeless plank on the sheets.

Even the most eager man would find it uninspiring.

What a mood killer.

Sweat clung to the tips of Julian's hair. With a flushed face, he asked in a husky voice, ""What's wrong? Not in the mood anymore?""

They didn't sleep together often, but it still happened a few times a month. Those were his attempts to plant an heir in her body.

Willow lay on the white pillow, staring up at the man she had been with for four long years.

She was exhausted. For once, she wanted to live for herself.

But Julian didn't know that. He kept questioning why she refused to be intimate with him and why she wouldn't cooperate in giving him a legitimate heir to help him secure more power.

Willow reached out, gently tracing her fingers along his face. In a soft voice, she said, ""Julian, let's get a divorce.""

His expression darkened, but he forced himself to stay calm. ""Is this because of Catherine? I've already told you. She's just a respected elder's daughter. You don't want her staying there, so I've already arranged for her to move elsewhere.""

Willow let out a sneer.

A respected elder's daughter who needed to be kept in a private villa? Who had to be held so intimately when they walked together?

Willow didn't even bother arguing. It was beneath her.

Instead, she pulled open the nightstand drawer and took out a divorce agreement. Shoving it into his hands, she said in a light tone, ""I want half of Nebula Group's shares in addition to the bank savings and real estate.""

Julian frowned. ""Half of Nebula Group's shares? That's a bit greedy, don't you think, Mrs. Ziegler?""

There was sarcasm in his voice, the same sharpness he used in business negotiations.

Willow's heart turned to ice.

Julian would never know that by taking that hit for him, she had lost her chance to ever become a mother. But she wasn't about to mention it. It would only sound pathetic.

She had never regretted loving or hating him. She had given everything freely, and now she was ready to walk away just as easily.

Willow leaned against the headboard. Her fair face looked gentle.

She considered things from Julian's perspective. ""If we get divorced, you can finally give your beloved a legitimate title. And I will take my shares and leave. That's a happy ending for everyone.""

She looked completely serious.

That was when Julian finally realized that this wasn't just a spur-of-the-moment tantrum. She had planned this.

As he looked at her, his dark eyes deepened, as if he could devour her whole.

For a long time, he said nothing. Then his voice dropped to an icy edge. ""Forget it, Willow. That's never happening. We're business partners. You know that as well as I do.""

Oh, she knew.

But now? She didn't want to play along anymore.

When she didn't respond, Julian grew irritated. He got up, threw on a robe, and headed for the guest room.

He felt that Willow just needed time to cool down. By morning, she would likely find herself enjoying the feeling of being Mrs. Ziegler again, along with the thrill of being second in command at Nebula Group.

Julian sneered inwardly. Willow had always been like that.

Behind him, Willow's voice came softly, almost a whisper. It sounded almost like the timid Willow from four years ago. ""Let's part on good terms, Julian. I really don't want to be with you anymore.""

Julian's body stiffened.

After a long pause, he walked back to the bed and spoke softly, ""You knew, from the moment you married me, that there is no love in the Ziegler family. I won't love you. And you'd better not expect it either. It won't make your life any easier.""

With a flick of his wrist, the divorce papers scattered to the floor like falling snow.

…

At 8:00 am, Julian walked down the stairs, dressed in a perfectly tailored black-and-white suit. Every inch of fabric hugged his lean, powerful frame. He exuded effortless elegance.

His mood had been fine. That was, until he walked into the empty dining room.

Lifting his coffee cup, he asked the maid casually, ""Where's Willow?""

They had argued loudly last night, the noise echoing through the house. Even the maids knew about it. The maid replied cautiously, ""Mrs. Ziegler left for work early this morning.""

Julian slammed his coffee cup down with a heavy thud.

He suddenly lost his appetite.

30 minutes later, he arrived at Nebula Group in his car. His secretary, Esther Barker, was already waiting at the parking lot.

The black car came to a stop. Esther opened the car door and immediately briefed Julian on the day's meetings. As Julian walked, he buttoned up his suit jacket. His every move exuded masculine charm, causing several female employees to sneak glances.

The two of them stepped into the private elevator.

Esther paused, then lowered her voice. ""Ms. Harper has suddenly placed her people in Project Aurelia.""

Julian glanced at the glowing red numbers on the panel.

After a while, he chuckled. ""Looks like she's growing bolder.""

…

During the meeting, Julian and Willow clashed in a heated debate.

They were married, and Willow's business tactics were ones Julian had personally taught her. Watching them clash now was truly something to behold. The executives at Nebula Group were getting their money's worth in entertainment.

By the time the meeting ended, the sun was already setting.

Back in her office, Willow collapsed onto the leather couch, rubbing her temples.

A dull headache throbbed at her skull, making her feel drained. She let down her long hair, letting it fall in loose waves.

Annie set a glass of water on the table and whispered, ""Mr. Ziegler's personal attorney called. He'd like to meet you downstairs in the café. Do you want to go?""

Willow raised an eyebrow. ""Jeffrey Gibson?""

Jeffrey Gibson was one of the top lawyers in the country. His firm, Gibson Legal Group, was an industry leader.

More importantly, he was Julian's hidden hand. If Julian had something inconvenient to handle, Jeffrey handled it for him.

They were more than business associates. Their interests were deeply intertwined.

Julian could divorce Willow, but he would never burn bridges with Jeffrey.

Sending him meant one thing—Julian didn't want the divorce to become public knowledge.

After a moment's thought, Willow agreed.

…

Ten minutes later, she took the private elevator down to the café on the first floor.

Jeffrey sat by the window, dressed in a tailored three-piece suit that highlighted his tall, broad frame. His features were sharp, with a habitual expression of sternness.

Upon hearing Willow's footsteps, he looked up at her.

In his typically unreadable eyes, a flicker of surprise showed.

This wasn't the Willow he remembered.

In Jeffrey's memory, she was always impeccably dressed in expensive suits, standing by Julian's side with flawless composure as they navigated the cutthroat business world. But everyone in their circle knew that Julian didn't love Willow. His heart belonged to someone else.

But Willow looked different today.

She had changed into a comfortable, lightweight knit sweater that clung just slightly to her frame. Her sleek hair, with a subtle curl, fell loosely over her shoulders, looking soft.

Just as Jeffrey was mesmerized by her beauty, she sat across from him and asked coldly, ""Julian sent you?""

Jeffrey regained his usual calm composure.

He took a document from his briefcase and gently pushed it toward Willow. ""Mrs. Ziegler, according to this prenup, if you insist on divorcing, you won't get much out of it.""

Willow flipped through the pages. When she flipped to the last page, she paused for a moment. A flicker of surprise crossed her face.

Four years ago, Julian had kept a trump card hidden.

Willow stared at the document for a long time before finally saying, ""Even if I get nothing, I still want a divorce. And Jeffrey, don't call me Mrs. Ziegler anymore. Just call me Willow.""

After dealing with so many celebrity divorce cases, Jeffrey had become completely detached.

He picked up his cup and took a sip of his coffee. ""Why now? I thought you loved Julian. Affairs happen all the time in our world.""

Willow turned away, laughing bitterly.

Everyone knew she loved Julian, but Julian himself. Or maybe he knew. He just didn't care.

At that moment, Willow exuded a fragile kind of beauty. One that, in Jeffrey's eyes, was more likely to make a man want to possess her than even Catherine.

As he was contemplating this, the café door swung open, and a tall figure walked toward them.

It was none other than Julian.

As soon as he entered, he saw Jeffrey staring intently at Willow like he was lost in thought.

Suddenly, Julian felt a discomfort rise in his chest.

Chapter 3

Julian gave Jeffrey a slight nod.

Jeffrey smiled faintly and left, giving the couple, who were on different wavelengths, some space.

After Jeffrey left, Julian glanced at Willow and frowned. ""Why are you dressed like that? Go change. We're having dinner at the Ziegler residence later.""

Willow understood perfectly. When Julian mentioned ""dinner"", it was code for showing off their fake affection for Dominic's stake in the company.

At times, Willow couldn't help but feel that Julian was a contradiction. He presented himself as polished and serene, but beneath the surface, he was more driven by ambition and wealth than anyone. He was perfectly suited for the world of power and status.

Willow was willing to go along with it. Before they separated their assets, she would prioritize their interests.

She returned to her office to change into a suit and met Julian in the private elevator.

The elevator was empty except for the two of them.

Julian glanced at his watch and said casually, ""I think you've probably dropped the idea of divorce after talking to Jeffrey. You’re still in your fertile window. Get ready when we get home. If you're not into it, I'll make it quick.""

Willow gave a self-deprecating smile. Julian was as indifferent as ever when it came to discussing having children. And she had endured such a marriage for four years.

She was even colder. ""Same as before. I'll take half the assets and let you go free.""

Julian didn't like that response. He was about to snap when the elevator suddenly stopped.

The doors slid open.

Standing outside was a young lady in a white dress. She looked pure and innocent.

It was Catherine.

She stepped into the elevator and looked at Willow with a cautious plea. ""The employee elevator's broken. Can I borrow this one, Ms. Harper?""

There were three people in the elevator, yet it felt crowded.

Willow held the open button, saying nothing, but her message was clear.

Catherine was mortified. Her beautiful face flushed red. Biting her lip, she looked at Julian, silently asking him to step in and support her.

Julian, however, spoke gently. ""Do as Ms. Harper says.""

Catherine reluctantly stepped out of the elevator.

The whole scene disgusted Willow.

She didn't say a word even until she got into the car in the parking lot. Julian, however, casually spoke as he fastened his seatbelt, ""There's nothing between us. Don't overthink it.""

Willow turned and quietly watched him. ""Feeling sorry for her? Julian, maybe you should go get checked at a hospital.""

Julian misunderstood. He thought she was talking about their fertility. He answered naturally, ""I can have children.""

Willow sneered. ""I meant… You should get checked for STDs.""

That set him off.

He unbuckled his seatbelt, yanked her over, and pulled her onto his lap. Luckily, the car's front seat was spacious enough for him to move freely.

Willow's body hit the steering wheel with a painful thud.

She pushed him away with all her strength. ""Are you out of your mind, Julian?""

Julian, who seemed so refined, now had his head buried between her legs, doing all sorts of unmentionable things. In her frustration, Willow grabbed his hair and yanked so hard she almost pulled it out.

Finally, Julian stopped. He looked up at her.

His face was bathed in the dim light of the underground parking lot. His long lashes cast shadows over his sharp features. At that moment, his expression was almost tender and filled with pity.

Willow was taken aback.

But before she could react, Julian grabbed the back of her neck and kissed her violently. He bit down hard on her tongue, drawing blood.

Her blood mixed with their saliva.

Willow froze, staring at him in disbelief. Her disdain in her eyes was so obvious. Julian, still holding her lips, whispered, ""Am I clean, Mrs. Ziegler?"" His voice sounded breathless, showing great restraint.

Willow shoved him away.

She sat back in the passenger seat, trembling as she straightened her suit. Yet her chest still heaved from Julian's intense passion. This unfamiliar surge of emotions scared her, but she tried to appear calm. ""Don't worry. I'll have Annie arrange a checkup.""

Julian was aroused, but his desire waned when he saw her indifferent expression.

He buckled his seatbelt and stepped on the gas.

During the drive, Julian's phone rang several times. Willow guessed it was Catherine calling, but she had already decided on the divorce and didn't bother asking.

Julian glanced at Willow, his gaze lingering for a moment.

…

Half an hour later, the black car pulled up to a grand mansion.

The car stopped. Julian glanced at his phone and said casually, ""Work stuff.""

Willow didn't respond.

Annoyed, Julian was about to say something when the Ziegler residence's maid opened the car door with a warm smile. ""Everyone's waiting for you, Mr. and Mrs. Ziegler. Please come in and join us.""

Julian nodded graciously. He even took Willow's hand, playing up the loving husband act.

Willow found it all so fake.

They entered the dining room and joined the family for dinner.

Dominic had two sons, the eldest Tyler Ziegler, and the second Liam Ziegler. Julian was Liam's son.

A large round table was filled with people, and it was clear Dominic had heard about Catherine. He gave Julian a few sharp words and then tried to talk to Willow about compromise and letting things slide.

It was all code for wanting a grandson.

Julian glanced at Willow and smiled. ""I'll work hard with Willow tonight.""

Dominic's face grew stern. ""Didn't you do anything for the past four years?""

Julian deflected the comment with a few words.

Willow, meanwhile, kept eating, her expression blank. No one knew she could hardly have children anymore.

It was all because of Julian.

Just then, Julian's phone rang. He glanced at it and walked out to the front yard to answer. It was clearly a private call.

A serving of fish was placed in Willow's bowl.

Dominic spoke with a meaningful tone, ""Men are like cats. Sometimes they stray, but eventually, they come home.""

Willow responded in her usual tone, ""I guess that day will be when he's under the ground.""

The maids stifled a giggle.

Willow, in a bad mood, left early and went to the backyard to clear her head.

By the swimming pool, the moonlight was cold.

A tall figure stepped into the light, someone who resembled Julian in many ways. It was Julian's cousin, Dexter Ziegler.

Dexter hated Willow. He blamed her for Julian's rise, and with Julian now having an affair, Dexter was ready to make things worse.

He handed Willow a stack of photos, all showing Julian and Catherine in compromising positions.

Dexter smirked as he asked, ""Do you know who this woman is? Her father is Charlie Burke, a famous artist with influence in the industry.

""Her mother, Nancy Rogers, is Julian's mother's best friend. What chance do you have to compete with her? Be careful, or Julian will leave you with nothing. It's not too late to work with me now.""

Willow glanced at the photos and tossed them in the trash.

She looked up at Dexter, meeting the gaze of this ruthless figure she had clashed with countless times. With a calm demeanor, she said, ""Thank you for your advice, but unfortunately, I won't be needing it.""

Dexter sneered. ""I'll be waiting for the day Julian dumps you.""

Willow smiled faintly.

She didn't care because she had no intention of holding onto Julian anymore.

Her dance with him was all just a waiting game. Once she got the money and the shares, Julian would be a thing of the past—just another fleeting memory of love and hate.

Willow turned to head back inside.

But as she lifted her gaze, she saw Julian.

He stood quietly in the hallway, a picture of elegance. The lighting highlighted his refined features, making him even more striking. It was this perfect appearance that had once captivated Willow.

His gaze was dark, even deeper than the night.

He had seen her talking to Dexter, and that same discomfort rose inside him again, much like the feeling he had when he saw Jeffrey staring at Willow in the café.

Chapter 4

It was 9:00 pm when they left the Ziegler residence.

As Julian fastened his seatbelt, he asked casually, ""What were you and Dexter talking about? You two seemed to be having a good time.""

Willow replied softly, ""Oh, just chatting about your childhood sweetheart.""

Julian was rendered speechless.

After a brief silence, he reached over and lightly clasped Willow's hand. His voice carried a rare hint of gentleness as he said, ""I never slept with her.""

Willow leaned back against the seat, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears.

She knew very well that Julian's tenderness was only because she was in her fertile window. He just wanted to plant his seed in her body.

It had nothing to do with love and even less to do with her.

She wondered if Julian would still try to hold on to this marriage if he found out she couldn't have children anymore. Or would he rush to sign the divorce papers and start searching for the next woman fit to be his wife?

He was putting in the effort tonight. He leaned in, his touch teasing, trying to stir her emotions.

Willow just felt pathetic.

Julian didn't love her. To him, she was a business asset and a vessel to bear his children. He didn't enjoy being intimate with her, yet every month, he came to her solely for the purpose of conceiving a child. How was that any different from an animal's instinctual mating?

She turned her face away from his approaching lips. Her voice was barely above a whisper, tinged with quiet sorrow as she said, ""I meant what I said about the divorce, Julian. If you think I'm asking for too much, we can renegotiate.""

Under the dim light of the car, Julian studied her face like he was trying to see through her skin and into her soul.

After a long silence, his voice turned cold. ""I already told you. Divorce is not an option. Once we have a child, you won't have time for all these wild ideas.""

Willow closed her eyes, exhaling softly. ""What if I can't have kids?""

He frowned, brushing off the thought. ""That's impossible. We both did full medical exams before we got married. Everything was fine.""

Willow let out a bitter laugh.

The health report from four years ago was long obsolete.

Just like the vows Julian had made when he proposed. They had vanished along with his conscience, lost in the warmth of Catherine's embrace.

…

By the time they returned to Grandview Manor, it was nearly 10:00 pm.

Julian took a shower in the guest room. He had planned to convince Willow to sleep with him tonight, but a phone call interrupted his plans. He left in a hurry.

Willow figured he was going to see Catherine.

She didn't care. At least for tonight, she didn't have to deal with him.

Julian didn't come home that night.

The lights in Grandview Manor burned until dawn, but the man of the house never returned.

For the next week, he didn't come home at all.

Julian hadn't made any moves to proceed with the divorce either.

What was Willow doing during those cold autumn nights?

Most nights, she stood by her bedroom's floor-to-ceiling window, watching the sycamore leaves outside turn yellow. She wondered if she would have been happier if she had never given up painting, never married so young, and never stepped into the business world.

She hadn't made a single call to Julian. A man who chose to spend his nights elsewhere might as well be dead to her.

…

The next time they saw each other, it was at a business function at Veil Club—Brindley's most exclusive business lounge.

The moment Willow walked into the private room, she saw Catherine snuggled up next to Julian. She looked every bit the devoted little darling.

When Catherine noticed Willow's arrival, she simply lowered her head and started playing on her phone, as if Willow wasn't even worth acknowledging.

Annie bristled with anger, ready to lash out.

But Willow stopped her. ""She's Mr. Ziegler's favorite now. Let her enjoy it while it lasts.""

There was no seat for her beside Julian. Naturally, she wasn't about to sit on the clients' side, so she excused herself for a trip to the restroom, giving Julian plenty of time to deal with Catherine.

The restroom was bathed in dazzling crystal light.

As Willow washed her hands, the sharp sound of approaching heels echoed behind her.

Willow lifted her gaze and saw Catherine in the mirror.

Catherine stepped beside Willow. Her usual deference was replaced with a sharp-edged provocation. ""I've moved back into the villa. Julian said I can stay as long as I want.""

Willow shut off the faucet.

She stared at that youthful face in the mirror.

Catherine's face was so innocent and plump. It was nothing like her own, which carried the faint weariness of years spent in the business world. Youth was a wonderful thing.

And yet, Willow suddenly remembered that she was only 26.

She lowered her head and slowly twisted the six-carat wedding ring on her finger before speaking calmly, ""Ms. Burke, if I were you, I'd stick to being Julian's well-kept canary. Stay quiet, keep him entertained, and ask for money.

""I certainly wouldn't go around broadcasting what happens in the bedroom. And honestly, why are you even here? This isn't the kind of place for you.""

Catherine smirked. ""Julian will protect me. He won't let me drink.""

""Is that so?""

Willow smiled faintly. ""You seem to misunderstand something, Ms. Burke. In Julian's world, money comes first. He keeps business and women separate. In a moment, he won't just ask you to drink. If it benefits him, he might as well hand you poison.""

Catherine paled. ""I don't believe you.""

Willow's smile faded.

After Catherine left, Willow stared at her reflection in the mirror, lost in thought. The bravado she'd put on earlier felt laughable, even to herself. She knew that if she played her cards right, she could always remain Mrs. Ziegler. But that wasn't the kind of life or marriage she wanted.

She was tired. Tired enough to flip the table.

By the time Willow returned to the private room, the seat beside Julian had already been cleared. She slipped into it naturally, picking up their old performance of a loving couple.

Catherine sat far away, looking pitiful. Her eyes were shimmering with unshed tears.

Julian frowned. ""Did you really have to be so hard on her?""

Willow didn't answer. He had no idea that every word he spoke in Catherine's defense felt like a blade slicing into her. He felt bad for Catherine, but what about her? What about all the years she had spent at his side, fighting battles with him?

What did that count for?

She was bleeding inside, but her expression remained calm. With a polite smile, she suggested Catherine have a drink with one of the clients. The man was clearly interested in her innocent charm.

Catherine, knowing she had Julian's favor, kept making excuses.

Under the crystal chandelier, Julian's handsome face darkened. The storm brewing in his eyes was undeniable.

Of course, he knew Willow was doing this on purpose.

Julian swirled his glass. His eyes were on Willow, but his words were meant for Catherine. ""Project Aurelia is a multi-billion collaboration. No matter what, Ms. Burke, you should at least show Mr. Smith some courtesy.""

Catherine didn't dare refuse anymore. Her lips trembled as she muttered, ""Okay.""

As she reluctantly raised her glass, Willow sat beside Julian, watching the scene unfold.

Julian put on a poker face, while Willow couldn't shake the feeling that she was playing the wicked woman who had buried his grand love.

They married at a young age and had been through a lot together. But at this moment, they had forgotten that entirely.

…

Late at night, in the underground parking lot, Annie held Willow steady and opened the car door. ""Careful, Ms. Harper. You drank a little too much tonight.""

Willow rubbed her temple and murmured, ""I was in a bad mood.""

Annie understood. Julian had crossed the line tonight.

Project Aurelia had been Willow's from the very beginning. She had built it from the ground up, secured every resource, every connection. And yet Julian had brought Catherine here tonight, right under her nose. No wonder Willow was pissed.

At least Catherine had ended up in the hospital. That was satisfying.

Just as Willow was about to get into the car, a strong hand grabbed her wrist.

Before she could react, she was shoved against the cold, sleek surface of a black SUV with a loud thud.

The car's imposing presence only made her seem more fragile and alone.

It took Willow a moment to steady herself from the pain. Then, she lifted her gaze to Julian's stormy expression and spoke softly, ""Give us a moment, Annie.""

Annie hesitated, but one look at Julian's expression made her swallow any protest. She only dared to whisper, ""Mrs. Ziegler isn't feeling well.""

Willow's eyes reddened slightly.

The moment Annie left, Julian snapped. He grabbed Willow's chin and demanded, ""Why did you have to be so hard on her? She's in the hospital right now, getting her stomach pumped. Willow, I told you. She's just a respected elder's daughter. I was only looking out for—""

The sharp crack of a slap cut him off.

Willow's palm stung, and her whole body trembled uncontrollably.

Looking at Julian, she smiled bitterly. ""Does looking out for her require you to bring her into the bed? Julian, are you completely shameless, or do you really think I'm that stupid?""

Julian's handsome face was whipped to the side.

Slowly, he turned back, running his tongue along the inside of his cheek. His gaze locked onto Willow, dark and murderous, yet his tone remained eerily calm. ""Is this how badly you want my love? Enough to do whatever it takes?""

Willow scoffed, mimicking his tone. ""Don't flatter yourself.""

Julian finally seemed to calm down.

After a long pause, he reached out and gently traced her face. ""You're not as obedient as you used to be back then, Willow. What's so bad about playing the perfect wife? Why don't you want to have a child to secure your place? Why do you care so much? Why must you always go against me?""

The night air was cold. Willow's face was streaked with tears, but she didn't even feel them.

""Back then? So, you do know it's in the past? Julian, do you really think we're still the same as before? Back then, there were no other women hanging around you.

""Back then, you still came home at night. Back then, you weren't tracking my ovulation just so I could pop out a child for you. So tell me, Julian. Was it you who changed, or was it me?""

After four years of sharing a bed, they had finally dropped all pretenses.

Julian studied her, the woman who had walked through the battlefield of power and ambition by his side for the past four years. After what felt like an eternity, his gaze darkened, like he had made a decision at that very moment.

The night was still, like the funeral of a love long gone.

Julian let go of Willow and took a step back. ""Starting tomorrow, you're off Project Aurelia. As for your position in the company, I'll discuss it with the board and make the necessary adjustments.""

Willow let out a chuckle.

The first thing he did after achieving success was to cut her off.

Deep down, they both knew that Catherine wasn't the real issue between them. Julian was simply burning the bridge, trying to push Willow back into the role of the perfect wife, whose sole duty was to bear his children. He called it love, but in reality, it was a lifelong cage.

Love… Children…

Something inside her snapped.

A bone-deep exhaustion washed over her. She suddenly felt that everything she did in the past had all been one-sided. Loving Julian wasn't fate; it was a curse.

She didn't want to hide it anymore.

She would tell Julian that she, Willow Harper, could never have children.

1mdt960,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mdt960,Do I need a new Tube,"Hi all, Looking for some advice. I’ve had my Breville Dual Boiler (BES920) for several years now, and today I opened it up for a quick internal inspection to check for any leaks or deteriorated O-rings.

While everything looked mostly good, I noticed one of the silicone tubes (circled in red in the photo) was slightly degraded — sticky to the touch and appears to be melting onto what I believe is the steam boiler.

Can anyone confirm what this particular tube is for? And does the required size/length vary by model year? I assume I can just replace it with food-grade high-temp silicone from a coffee parts supplier — any preferred vendors or recommendations would be appreciated.

Also, any tips to prevent this from happening again? From what I can tell, the tube may have softened over time and sagged onto the hot boiler, or perhaps it was routed that way from the factory.

Lastly, I didn’t get around to replacing the O-rings yet — it’s been over 3 years with the originals and there are no leaks so far, but I plan to replace them all as a preventative step soon.

Thanks in advance for any advice",2,1753939898.0,BrevilleCoffee,3,1.0,False

**The photos are from when I was younger, around 2012, 2013, 2018, 2018, 2020, 2023, and then lastly 2025.**

I've been sad about my hair growth and density lately. I went to the dermatologist and she said my scalp looks healthy and normal.. but that I most likely need to get my iron's ferritin up and just wait. 

I tested my ferritin level last year, and it was 9. My vitamin D level was also slightly low. I'm not sure how long it was that low, but after taking supplements for 6+ months, I got the ferritin up to 52, which still is low according to the derm.

  
**Diet/Lifestyle**: pescatarian since \~2018. I stopped using hormonal BC (2019) and switched to a non-hormonal IUD. I also exercise regularly, drink lots of water/electrolytes, and eat lots of whole foods already. I wfh so rarely heat/style my hair.

This is everything from my research and tips from others that I'm going to do over the next year, and see what happens.

***If you have anything tips or anything else I should be trying, please let me know in the comments!***

  
**Supplements/Nutrition**

* Nutrafol  
* Vitamin D 
* CoQ10 (was taking this from my egg freezing a few months ago and decided to stay on it)
* Iron pill + vitamin C every other day (my iron ferritin was 12 last year and I had vitamin D deficiency), so I got my ferritin up to 52 from 6 months of the pills, and I stopped taking this near my coffee in the morning to help absorption 
* protein shake every day and am trying to get 80g of protein a day 

**Habits:**

* Wearing my hair in braids when I run or hike outside 
* Wearing a hat anytime in the sun for UV protection
* Significantly reduce alcohol consumption 
* Red light helmet (iRestore professional)
* Trimming split ends 1x a week

**Hair Products:** 

* Working on dandruff/scalp health and washing every day or every other day to keep it clean (i've tried the whole dont wash my hair often for years and it has never helped my hair do anything except look greasy lol)
* Rosemary scalp oil 1x a week
* Olaplex 1-2x a week to repair 
* Unite 7-second detangler every day for UV protection

It seems like there's definitely overlap, but I'm wondering where the line is drawn.

my initial thought is that ""protective"" is more about preventing physical damage – cushioning a fragile item like a glass bottle to prevent breakage during shipping, for instance. ""Preservative,"" conversely, feels more focused on extending shelf life and preventing spoilage, like using a vacuum-sealed bag for coffee beans to keep them fresh longer.

But then I start thinking about things like modified atmosphere packaging for produce, which seems to do *both*. it protects the fruit from being crushed in transit and also alters the atmosphere inside to slow down ripening and decay. So, is it just a matter of the *primary* function? Or is there something more to it? What are some clear examples that highlight the difference?

Bear with me, this is a long one. I don’t know where else to vent.

I (32F) met my now husband (35M) 6 years ago. We hit it off straight away and I met his friends after a few weeks of knowing him. I then met his sister a month afterwards. At the time she was living in another state and made the trip to our city to meet me but from the start she was cold towards me. During that first meeting she barely made eye contact with me and then boasted about having broken up my partner and his previous girlfriend because she just wasn’t right for him.

At the time she was single and it seemed to consume all of her feelings. Anytime she’d come to town, my partner would apologise and tell me he was hanging out with his family for dinner (i.e., I wasn’t invited) but otherwise when she’d was interstate I was always invited to family dinners. His parents have always been great with me.

One time, during one of her trips to town when I wasn’t invited to dinner, I met up with a gay male friend for dinner. I invited my partner out of courtesy but knew he’d be busy with his sister and parents. The next day he broke down to me saying he was uncomfortable with me having dinner with a male friend (whom he didn’t know was gay) but said he wasn’t jealous he was just uncomfortable. When I asked him why it was suddenly an issue when I’d hung out with him before, he said “a friend of mine told me perhaps it’s not the best thing for our relationship, and now I’m unsure about us”. I asked him if the friend was his sister and he ultimately caved and said yes. This was a year into our relationship and we hadn’t had any trouble before that. 

Cut to family dinners, she literally oscillates between ignoring me (I have sat next to her on multiple occasions where her back was to me talking to the person on the other side and leaving me with nobody to speak to) or she will interrogate- like when she asked me to describe my wedding dress to her in front of my partner, at the time fiancé. I think most women know not to ask about those details in front of someone’s soon to be husband. She often asks me a question then looks away when I’m about to answer it so I’m left unsure if I should say anything. She also will just not acknowledge anything I say, like I’m invisible.

She’s mean, fell out with her best friend after years of talking shit behind her back. She doesn’t have any school friends except one who is too sweet to tell her that she’s unkind. And she cried the whole morning before my husband proposed (we were on a family holiday and I had no idea he was going to do it, it was just wild in hindsight that I came out to the verandah and she was bawling her eyes out because she was “hormonal”). She ignored me that whole trip.

We also went to Europe for a few days with my partner’s family where she barely said a word to me- she would literally ask my partner what coffee Id want when I was right next to him- anything better than talking to me.

She was also mad that my husband didn’t tell her when we got pregnant as soon as we found out, even though we told her at 10 weeks. Then proceeded to go to her nonna’s house the next day and cried for hours apparently - according to nonna.

Meanwhile, she asked her now husband for his sperm about 3 months into their relationship because she thought her chances at reproduction were low, but I think she was embellishing. He’s got a lot of money and it’s quite obvious that’s why she’s with him. She has no school friends, talks poorly about his sister, mother and grandmother to me, and pressured her husband into trying for a baby as soon as she found out we were pregnant. They had a daughter 5 months after us.

Anyway- I need advice on how to deal with her. We have a family holiday coming up and I’ve spoken to my husband in the past about how uncomfortable she makes me, and whenever he’s confronted her she’s gaslit him into thinking “noooo I love her what are you talking about?” Meanwhile barely acknowledges me. Our daughters are 5 months apart and she’s already comparing them and I can’t take it. My husband loves her a lot and I think he feels sorry for her because she doesn’t have many friends and seems to always milk the younger sister thing and needing her big brothers help which makes him feel important.

I’ve been kind to her over the years, I invited her to my birthday dinners with my closest friends and messaged her throughout her pregnancy but the only time she ever reaches out is to get information from me. She literally was very close to me before her wedding but I realised it was because she literally copied most of it- same band, photographer and almost an identical dress too. But when my daughter was in hospital a week after she was born, I didn’t hear from her. Didn’t hear from her for weeks.

What should I do? I can’t cut her out because she means too much to my husband and I don’t think it’d work logistically but I don’t want to confront her either because she’ll just deny it. How do I carry myself in our interactions? Help 😭 ",3,1753939756.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

But thankfully Richard was okay with our work on it even though it will constantly have to get fixed up. When I got home I was exhausted, but excited since I have (writing/written in present tense) a day off the next day. And to be a bit of a good note, Double XP; weekend is still going on my Xbox despite the fact the event tab says it isn't, so if I can keep this up and get to The Tomb round 999 with the ice staff, I can get the top level of prestige.

1mdsxax,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactivedogs/comments/1mdsxax/reactivity_to_people_fear_based_and_reactive_to/,Reactivity to people (fear based) and Reactive to dogs (leash frustration),"I’m looking for advice for my dog (1 year, 3-month-old Aussie) for people fear-based reactivity. He recently has been more reactive to people getting close to us during walks, and he’s gotten more reactive with new people in the house (barking, lunging).

Some background:
Before, when he was a puppy, he was a bit reactive to bikes and scooters, and sometimes people when they got too close. After a lot of training, he was eventually able to pass people and bikes without any reaction (he improved on scooters but not quite as much). All of this has regressed over the last month and a half. He’s much more reactive when people get close — not just when they are passing us. We live in a pretty busy area during the school year (college), and it’s pretty quiet now (summer) in terms of foot traffic.

⸻

Dog Reactivity (on leash)

This seems like leash frustration more than fear. My dog LOVES other dogs and is very confident in off-leash settings. He plays well, reads body language, and even handles conflict with other dogs calmly — like if another dog challenges him, he’ll hold his ground or correct without escalating.

On leash, though, if he sees another dog and can’t get to them, he pulls, cries, and may bark or lunge. Once he meets the dog, he’s friendly (I stopped leash greetings as this likely contributed to his leash reactivity to dogs). We’re working on this using:
	•	LAT (Look at That)
	•	“Find it” and engagement games
	•	Distance management
	•	Parallel walking setups

Progress has been slow, but he can at least pay attention if we start walking the opposite way and I redirect his behavior (look at me or heel). I can handle this part, but the people reactivity is harder.

⸻

People Reactivity (fear-based)

This is where it gets tricky. Jasper will:
	•	Lunge or try to nip at strangers, even if he seemed calm seconds earlier
	•	React especially when someone’s talking to me or standing still near us — also if they get too close
	•	Circle the person or hover before reacting
	•	Show big reactions at entrances (building front, inside home, etc.). He’s also reactive around the neighborhood

When we go into busy areas or new places — or places like the vet or groomer — he is less reactive.

⸻

Example:
A Rover dog walker came to meet him. He lunged multiple times while we were talking after I went to go get her from the front entrance (I figured he would be better if we walked her in instead of her showing up at my front door — he wasn’t). Even when we went inside the apartment, he would be calm, but then be reactive out of nowhere, and tried circling around the coffee table to try to nip. I wanted to test something I had a suspicion about.

We all left the apartment and let him cool down. Then we tested her going in alone without me, and with my spouse present. The walker said that he was suddenly calm, even wagging and smiling at her. He let her put the harness on him and was able to take him outside. We met up afterwards, and she let us know that he was really calm. However, as soon as we got him back and we were present, he went back to being reactive.

That’s when it clicked: my presence might be escalating things — like he feels he has to “protect” me/my spouse or manage the situation.

⸻

I used to think he was just a confident dog. Now I think he’s confident around dogs, but conflicted and fearful around new people/strangers.

Another example is when we visited my father-in-law (first time meeting him). When we went to visit him, he barked at him every single time he came to his house after work and stayed close to him (for a straight month) After a while, he would calm down, but he wasn’t lunging. However, when my father-in-law walked him alone in public, or came back home when we were not there, he wouldn’t be reactive.

⸻

Some other background:
	•	I have three friends who visit my place often, and he’s good with them now — but it took him a couple of months for him to not react when they would come in (place training, crate training, and them giving him treats when he was calm helped).
	•	Both my spouse and I work from home, so we’re with him most of the time.
	•	We have boarded him with a sitter (house with yard) multiple times, but other than that he is with us for most of the time.

	•	How do I safely build positive exposure to people without constantly triggering him? Sometimes he’s fine if there are people around, but sometimes he reacts even though someone is 10 to 20 feet away from us or across the street (it varies) but he is always vigilant.
	•	Is this something I must bring a behaviorist in for, or is it manageable at home?
	•	How do you create structured, low-pressure setups for people reactivity? This is hard to do with strangers lol. And the people I can ask for help, he’s already familiar with.

⸻

Open to any advice. I’m planning on starting muzzle training for safety reasons while we work through his reactivity that has gotten worse. 

TL;DR:
My 1-year-old Aussie has regressed in his training and become more fear-reactive to people, especially near our home and when I’m present. He lunges or tries to nip at strangers, even after appearing calm. He’s great with dogs off-leash, and his on-leash dog reactivity is improving slowly with training. With people, though, he reacts unpredictably, especially if they approach or talk to me. Oddly, he’s calmer when strangers handle him without me around. Looking for advice on how to safely build positive exposure to people without constant triggering, and whether this is something I can manage at home or need a behaviorist for.

# Chapter 1: The Basics of Weight Loss

Before we dive into strategies, habits, and mindsets, we need to address one unshakable truth about weight loss: it all comes down to calories in versus calories out (CICO). No matter what diet you follow, what exercise plan you try, or what supplements you take, weight loss only happens when you consume fewer calories than your body burns.

# The Science of Weight Loss

At its core, your body is a machine that requires energy to function. This energy comes from the food you eat, measured in calories. Your body uses these calories for everything—from keeping your heart beating and lungs breathing to fueling your workouts and daily activities.

* **Calories In (CI):** The energy you take in through food and drinks.
* **Calories Out (CO):** The energy your body uses to function, broken down into three main components:
   1. **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR):** The calories your body burns at rest just to stay alive.
   2. **Activity Level:** The calories burned through movement and exercise.
   3. **Thermic Effect of Food (TEF):** The calories burned digesting and processing the food you eat.

When you consume more calories than your body burns, the surplus is stored as fat. When you consume fewer calories than your body needs, your body taps into its fat stores for energy. This caloric deficit is the foundation of weight loss.

# Why CICO Always Works

The beauty of CICO is its simplicity. Whether you’re eating low-carb, high-protein, or intermittent fasting, the underlying principle is the same: you’ll only lose weight if you’re in a caloric deficit.

* Keto? It works because it often reduces your appetite, leading to fewer calories consumed.
* Intermittent fasting? It works because you naturally eat fewer calories by limiting your eating window.
* Whole30, paleo, vegan? They work if they help you eat fewer calories overall.

# The Myths Surrounding Weight Loss

Many people get caught up in the myths and noise surrounding weight loss. Let’s clear up a few misconceptions:

1. **“I need to eat clean to lose weight.”** While eating nutritious food is important for your health, you can technically lose weight eating pizza and ice cream if you stay in a caloric deficit. Of course, your body composition and overall health will benefit from a balanced diet, but weight loss itself is purely about the numbers.
2. **“Certain foods make you fat.”** No single food causes weight gain. Overeating causes weight gain. Even so-called “unhealthy” foods can fit into a weight loss plan if your caloric intake remains below your caloric output.
3. **“I can out-exercise a bad diet.”** Exercise is a fantastic tool for boosting your caloric output, but it’s much easier to overeat calories than to burn them off. A slice of pizza can take 10 minutes to eat but 90 minutes of running to burn. Nutrition plays a far greater role in weight loss than exercise alone.

# Why This Matters

Understanding the basics of CICO empowers you to take control. It removes the mystery and confusion surrounding weight loss. You don’t need the latest fad diet or miracle supplement. You simply need to create a caloric deficit—and there are countless ways to achieve it.

In this book, we’ll explore strategies to make that deficit easier and more sustainable. But no matter what methods resonate with you, remember this: the science of weight loss doesn’t change. It’s not about tricks, hacks, or quick fixes. It’s about balancing the equation in your favor.

Now that we’ve established this foundational truth, let’s talk about why achieving a caloric deficit feels so hard—and why willpower alone isn’t the solution.

**Chapter 2: Your Greatest Enemy**

If weight loss is so simple—just consume fewer calories than you burn—then why does it feel so hard? Why do so many people struggle to achieve and maintain their goals?

The answer lies in your first and greatest enemy: willpower.

# The Illusion of Willpower

When most people think about losing weight, they believe success comes down to trying harder. They assume they just need more discipline, more grit, and more determination. But this mindset is a trap.

Willpower is not a limitless resource. It’s more like a rechargeable battery. Every time you make a decision—what to eat, whether to exercise, whether to say no to dessert—you drain that battery a little more. By the end of a long day filled with decisions, your willpower reserves are often depleted, leaving you vulnerable to temptation.

This is why diets that rely on constant self-control tend to fail. No one can be “on” all the time.

# Why Willpower Fails

1. **It’s Finite:** Imagine starting your day with a jar of willpower tokens. Each decision you make costs a token. By the time you face your biggest challenges—like resisting late-night snacks or choosing the gym over the couch—the jar is empty.
2. **It’s Reactive, Not Preventative:** Willpower works in the moment, but it doesn’t address the root causes of your struggles, like emotional eating or poor planning.
3. **It’s Easily Overwhelmed:** Stress, fatigue, and emotional triggers can overpower even the strongest willpower. When life gets hard, the “just try harder” strategy falls apart.

# The Willpower Trap

Consider this scenario: You wake up motivated to eat healthily. You skip breakfast (saving calories!), have a small salad for lunch, and avoid the snacks in the breakroom. But by dinner, you’re starving, exhausted, and stressed. Your brain, craving relief, urges you to eat something comforting. Before you know it, you’ve polished off a pint of ice cream and half a bag of chips.

This isn’t a personal failing. It’s biology. Your brain is wired to seek the path of least resistance, especially when energy is low. And when you rely on willpower alone, you’re fighting a losing battle.

# The Alternative to Willpower

If willpower isn’t the answer, what is? The key is to design your environment and habits so you don’t need to rely on willpower at all. Instead of battling cravings or forcing yourself to make the right choice, you create systems where the healthy choice is the easy one.

Here’s a preview of how we’ll address this in future chapters:

* **Automation:** Build habits that make healthy eating automatic.
* **Environment Design:** Remove temptations and set yourself up for success.
* **Mindset Shifts:** Learn to work with your biology, not against it.

# Your First Step

For now, understand this: You’re not failing because you’re weak or lack discipline. You’re failing because the system you’re using is broken. Willpower alone isn’t enough—it was never designed to handle the constant demands of modern life.

In the next chapter, we’ll dive into practical strategies to make weight loss feel effortless, starting with the concept of activation energy and how to reshape your environment. But first, let go of the myth that willpower will save you. It won’t. And that’s okay, because there’s a better way.

# Chapter 3: Your Best Friend

In the last chapter, we uncovered the truth about willpower: it’s limited, unreliable, and prone to failure. Now, let’s go deeper. The real problem isn’t just that willpower runs out—it’s that it’s working against forces far more powerful. One of those forces is activation energy. Understanding activation energy can transform how you approach weight loss, turning it into an ally instead of an enemy.

# The Science of Activation Energy

In physics, activation energy is the energy required to start a reaction. Imagine trying to roll a heavy boulder up a hill. The initial push—the energy it takes to overcome the slope—is the activation energy. Once the boulder is over the hill, gravity takes over, and it rolls effortlessly.

In your daily life, every decision you make requires activation energy. Want to eat healthier? You’ll need energy to chop vegetables, cook a meal, and avoid the temptation of fast food. Want to exercise? You’ll need energy to change into gym clothes, drive to the gym, and start moving.

Here’s the catch: bad choices often require little to no activation energy. Grabbing a bag of chips or ordering a pizza is effortless. The path of least resistance is paved with unhealthy options. And when you’re tired, stressed, or short on time, that low activation energy becomes irresistible.

# Why Activation Energy Beats Willpower

1. **It’s Automatic:** Activation energy works whether you’re aware of it or not. You’ll always gravitate toward the easier option unless you intentionally change the equation.
2. **It’s Persistent:** Unlike willpower, which fades over time, activation energy is always at play. A high barrier to entry will stop you in your tracks every time.
3. **It’s Predictable:** By understanding and controlling activation energy, you can design your environment to favor good choices and make bad ones nearly impossible.

# Flipping the Script: Make It Hard to Fail

The key to lasting weight loss isn’t summoning more willpower—it’s lowering the activation energy for healthy habits while raising it for unhealthy ones. Here’s how you can use activation energy to your advantage:

1. **Eliminate Temptation**If unhealthy food is within arm’s reach, you’ll eat it. The solution? Remove it entirely. Don’t keep chips, cookies, or soda in your home. If they’re not there, you won’t eat them. You’d have to expend energy to drive to the store, buy them, and bring them back—creating a high activation energy barrier.
2. **Pre-Make Good Choices Easy**Make the healthy option the default choice. Prep your meals for the week so they’re ready to grab and eat. Keep a bowl of washed fruit on the counter. Lay out your gym clothes the night before. By lowering the activation energy for healthy habits, you remove the friction that stops you from taking action.
3. **Create Speed Bumps for Bad Habits**The harder it is to indulge in unhealthy habits, the less likely you are to do them. For example:
   * Keep junk food out of the house.
   * Remove delivery apps from your phone.
   * Set your alarm across the room so you have to physically get up to turn it off and start your day.
4. **Automate Good Choices**Automation removes activation energy altogether. Set up recurring grocery deliveries with healthy options. Sign up for fitness classes that charge a cancellation fee to keep you accountable. Use apps that track your progress without requiring manual input. Automation means you don’t have to rely on decisions at all—healthy habits happen by default.

# Real-Life Examples

* **The Office Snack Swap:** In a workplace study, researchers found that when candy bowls were placed six feet away from employees instead of on their desks, candy consumption dropped by over 50%. The small increase in activation energy—standing up and walking—was enough to deter people from eating candy impulsively.
* **The Gym Trick:** Lay out your workout clothes, shoes, and water bottle the night before. You’ve lowered the activation energy for exercising. Once dressed, the momentum is already on your side.

# Designing a Life That Works for You

Activation energy isn’t just about avoiding bad habits—it’s about reshaping your environment to set yourself up for success. Think of it like this: your environment is your best friend in the weight loss journey. A well-designed environment doesn’t just nudge you toward healthier choices—it makes them inevitable.

In the next chapter, we’ll take this principle even further. You’ll learn how to automate weight loss entirely, turning good habits into effortless routines. But for now, remember: you don’t need to fight bad habits with willpower. You just need to make them harder to start.

# Chapter 4: Replace

The easiest way to win the battle against willpower is to avoid fighting it in the first place. Instead of relying on discipline to resist temptations, you can design your life in a way that removes the triggers forcing you to use willpower. In this chapter, we’ll focus on two major stimuli that sabotage your weight loss efforts:

1. **Cravings and Hunger**
2. **The Presence of Unhealthy Food in Your Environment**

By addressing these triggers, you’ll create a system where weight loss feels automatic—like it’s happening without effort.

# Stimulus 1: Cravings and Hunger

Cravings and hunger are biological responses that can overpower even the strongest willpower. If you’re constantly hungry or battling intense cravings, you’re setting yourself up for failure. The key is to ensure that you always feel full and satisfied. Here’s how:

# 1. Eat More Protein

Protein is your best ally when it comes to feeling full. It digests slowly, keeps you satisfied for longer, and helps regulate your appetite. Plus, it supports muscle preservation and fat loss.

* **What is Protein?** Protein comes from foods like chicken, beef, fish, eggs, and even plant-based options like tofu and legumes.
* **How Much Should You Eat?** Aim for 100 grams of protein per day. This might sound overwhelming if you’ve never tracked your protein intake before, but don’t worry—we’ll dive into measuring and tracking in the next chapter. For now, focus on adding more protein to your meals.

Examples:

* A chicken breast (around 30g of protein)
* A piece of salmon (25g of protein)
* Three eggs (18g of protein)

# 2. Replace Seed Oils with Olive Oil

Seed oils (like soybean, canola, and sunflower oil) are known to contribute to cravings and inflammation. While eliminating them entirely might seem drastic, replacing them with healthier alternatives like olive oil makes it sustainable.

* **Why Olive Oil?** Olive oil is a heart-healthy fat that doesn’t cause the same cravings as seed oils. It’s versatile and works well for cooking, salads, and more.
* **How to Transition:** Start small. Replace your usual cooking oil with olive oil and look for dressings and condiments made without seed oils.

**3. Cut Refined Sugar and Use Natural Sweeteners**

Refined sugars—like high fructose corn syrup, glucose syrup, and brown rice syrup—are some of the biggest culprits behind cravings. These sugars cause a spike in blood sugar, followed by a crash, which triggers hunger and the desire for more sugar.

* **The Solution:** Replace refined sugar with natural alternatives like stevia and monk fruit juice. These sweeteners provide sweetness without the blood sugar spikes.
* **How to Transition:** Look for natural sweeteners in coffee, tea, and recipes. Gradually reduce your reliance on sugar by swapping it out for healthier alternatives.

# Stimulus 2: The Presence of Unhealthy Food

Even if you’re full and satisfied, the mere presence of unhealthy food in your environment can trigger you to eat it. Humans are hardwired to seek out high-calorie, tasty foods when they’re available—it’s a survival mechanism.

# The Solution: Out of Sight, Out of Mind

1. **Remove Temptations:** Don’t keep chips, cookies, or soda in your house. If they’re not there, you won’t eat them.
2. **Make Healthy Choices Convenient:** Stock your fridge with prepped vegetables, lean proteins, and fruits. Keep healthy snacks like nuts or Greek yogurt within easy reach.

# Building Your Automatic System

By addressing these two triggers—cravings and the presence of unhealthy food—you eliminate the need to constantly rely on willpower. Instead, your environment and habits do the heavy lifting for you.

In the next chapter, we’ll take this even further by showing you how to measure and track your progress without feeling overwhelmed. For now, focus on these simple steps:

* Add protein to every meal.
* Replace seed oils with olive oil.
* Swap refined sugar for natural sweeteners.
* Clear out unhealthy foods from your home.

When you stop fighting triggers and start designing an environment that works for you, weight loss becomes a natural, automatic process.

# Chapter 5: Reprogram

By now, you’ve taken the first steps to eliminate cravings and set up an environment that supports weight loss. You’ve added more protein to your meals, swapped out seed oils for olive oil, replaced refined sugar with natural sweeteners, and cleared your home of unhealthy foods.

But let’s be honest: making these changes isn’t easy at first. It requires effort, focus, and, yes, even a little willpower. The good news? That effort is temporary.

# The Science of Reprogramming

Habits are like grooves in your brain—a well-worn path that’s easy to follow. When you start a new behavior, you’re carving out a new path, which takes energy and focus. But the more you walk that path, the deeper it becomes, and eventually, it becomes automatic.

This process usually takes about three weeks. During those first 21 days, you’re rewiring your brain, building new habits, and replacing old ones. After that, the changes you’ve made will feel natural—like second nature.

And here’s something crucial: slipping up doesn’t mean starting over. One mistake doesn’t erase your progress. The brain doesn’t hit a reset button because of a single misstep. What matters is the overall pattern of consistency—not perfection.

# Week 1: The Resistance Phase

The first week is the hardest. You might feel like you’re swimming against the current. Your brain is used to your old habits, and it will resist change. You might:

* Crave the foods you’ve eliminated.
* Forget to prep meals or reach for unhealthy snacks out of habit.
* Feel frustrated by the extra effort required.

**What to Do:**

1. **Remind Yourself Why You’re Doing This:** Keep your goal front and center. Write it down and revisit it daily.
2. **Plan Ahead:** Make it as easy as possible to stick to your new habits. Prep your meals, lay out your groceries, and remove temptations.
3. **Focus on Progress, Not Perfection:** If you slip up, don’t panic. One bad meal or snack won’t ruin everything. Instead of thinking, *I’ve failed,* remind yourself: *This is a small bump on the road, not a dead end.*

# Week 2: The Groove Phase

By the second week, things start to feel easier. The initial resistance fades, and your new habits begin to take hold. You’ll notice:

* Cravings start to diminish.
* You feel fuller and more satisfied with your meals.
* Your environment supports your goals—healthy food is easy to access, and unhealthy options are out of sight.

**What to Do:**

1. **Stay Consistent:** Keep repeating your new habits, even if they still require some effort.
2. **Celebrate Small Wins:** Notice how much better you feel and how your cravings are changing. Acknowledge your progress—it’s motivating!
3. **Accept Imperfection:** If you find yourself eating something you didn’t plan for or skipping a step, don’t let guilt derail you. Your habits are like a snowball—they keep building as long as you keep moving forward.

# Week 3: The Automatic Phase

By the third week, you’ll feel like a different person. Your brain has adapted to your new habits, and the changes feel almost effortless. You’ll find that:

* Choosing healthy options becomes your default.
* You no longer think about the foods you’ve eliminated.
* Your cravings for unhealthy foods are minimal or gone entirely.

What to Do:

1. **Lean Into the New You:** Enjoy the ease that comes with your new habits.
2. **Reflect on Your Journey:** Think about how far you’ve come and how much easier weight loss feels now.
3. **Keep Perspective:** Even at this stage, occasional slips are normal. A single cookie or skipped workout won’t undo your progress. The new habits you’ve built are far stronger than one moment of indulgence.

# The Power of Consistency, Not Perfection

The key to reprogramming your brain is consistency. It’s about showing up and making the right choices more often than not. You don’t need to be perfect to succeed. Missing one step doesn’t send you back to square one—it’s just a tiny detour.

Think of your journey like climbing a staircase. A slip doesn’t mean you fall all the way back down. You’re still on the staircase, one step closer to your goal.

# Your New Normal

After three weeks, you’ll feel like your brain has been reprogrammed. The habits that once required effort will feel easy, and you’ll have built a foundation for sustainable weight loss.

The best part? This isn’t just about losing weight—it’s about becoming someone who effortlessly makes healthy choices. Someone who doesn’t rely on willpower or discipline, because the system they’ve built does the work for them.

So embrace the challenge of the first three weeks. Push through the resistance, stay consistent, and remember: a slip is just that—a slip, not a failure. You’re reprogramming your brain, and every step forward is a step toward a life where healthy choices feel effortless.

**Chapter 6: Turn Into a Weight Loss Machine**

By this point, you’ve reprogrammed your habits, eliminated triggers, and built a foundation for sustainable weight loss. Now, it’s time to get practical. This chapter is your guide for turning into a weight loss machine—a system that operates smoothly, predictably, and effectively.

**Step 1: Calculate Your Maintenance Calories**

The first step in any weight loss journey is understanding your starting point: your maintenance calories. These are the calories you need to eat every day to maintain your current weight. Once you know this number, you can create a caloric deficit that leads to weight loss.

**How to Find Your Maintenance Calories**

1. **Google a TDEE Calculator:** TDEE stands for Total Daily Energy Expenditure—the number of calories your body burns in a day, including activity. Plug in your age, gender, weight, height, and activity level to get your TDEE.
2. **Subtract 300 Calories:** To lose weight, aim for a 300-calorie deficit from your maintenance calories. This number is sustainable, prevents extreme hunger, and minimizes muscle loss. For example:

* If your TDEE is 2,000 calories, your daily target is 1,700 calories.

**Step 2: Measure and Track Your Food**

Now that you know how many calories to consume, the next step is tracking. Tracking your food intake ensures that you’re staying within your calorie target. This might sound tedious at first, but with practice, it becomes second nature.

**Why a Food Scale Is Your Best Friend**

Measuring portions by eye is almost always inaccurate. A food scale eliminates the guesswork.

* **Buy a Digital Food Scale:** Look for one that’s affordable and easy to use.
* **Measure Everything You Cook:** Whether it’s chicken, rice, or olive oil, use your scale to weigh your portions in grams.

**Reading Nutrition Facts**

When buying packaged foods, always check the nutrition label. Look for:

* **Serving Size:** Measure the serving size with your food scale to ensure accuracy.
* **Calories per Serving:** Log this into a tracking app like MyFitnessPal.
* **Ingredients:** Avoid hidden sugars and oils that can add extra calories.

**Tracking When Eating Out**

Eating out doesn’t mean you can’t track:

* **Look Up Nutrition Info:** Many restaurants provide calorie counts online.
* **Estimate When Necessary:** If no info is available, search for similar dishes in your calorie tracker.

**Step 3: Avoid Common Mistakes**

The biggest calorie-tracking mistakes are often small things that add up over time. Here’s what to watch out for:

1. **Forgetting Sauces and Condiments:**

* Ketchup, mayo, and dressings can pack hundreds of hidden calories. Measure these carefully or choose low-calorie alternatives.

1. **Ignoring Snacks:**

* Those “just a handful” moments with chips or nuts? They add up quickly. Always measure.

1. **Underestimating Cooking Oils:** 

* Olive oil is healthy but calorie-dense. Measure how much you use when cooking.

1.  **Not Accounting for Drinks:**

* Sugary drinks, fancy coffees, and even fruit juices are calorie bombs. Stick to water, tea, or black coffee.

**Step 4: Easy Calorie-Burning Tips**

While your caloric deficit should come from food, small daily actions can increase your calorie burn without much effort. Think of these as passive ways to boost your results:

* **Park Farther Away:** When going to the store, park at the far end of the lot and walk the extra steps.
* **Take the Stairs:** Whenever possible, skip the elevator and use the stairs.
*  **Move During TV Time:** Do light stretching, stand, or even pace during commercial breaks or binge-watching sessions.
* **Break Up Sitting Time**: Set a timer to stand or walk for a few minutes every hour.

These little habits don’t feel like exercise, but over time, they increase your total calorie burn and complement your diet.

**Step 5: Stay Consistent**

Consistency is the engine of your weight loss machine. Tracking your calories daily and sticking to your deficit will bring predictable results. And remember:

* It’s Not About Perfection: If you go over your calorie target one day, don’t panic. Just get back on track the next day. Progress happens over weeks and months, not single days.
* Keep Adapting: As your weight changes, so will your TDEE. Recalculate your maintenance calories every few weeks and adjust your deficit accordingly.

**A System That Works for You**

By calculating your maintenance calories, tracking your intake, avoiding common pitfalls, and adding small calorie-burning habits, you’ve created a system that works. This is the ultimate weight loss machine: simple, effective, and sustainable.

You don’t need extreme diets or hours of exercise to see results. All you need is consistency, accuracy, and the willingness to trust the process. Your weight loss journey is now in motion, powered by habits that will keep you moving forward effortlessly.

# Chapter 7: Keep It Simple

When it comes to weight loss, complexity is your enemy. The more rules, restrictions, and moving parts you introduce, the harder it is to stay consistent. That’s why the key to sustainable success is to **keep it simple.**

The truth is, you don’t need to micromanage every calorie or follow a perfect diet. You just need to eliminate the stimuli that cause overeating. And the biggest stimuli? **Hunger and cravings.**

# Why Hunger and Cravings Are the Real Problem

Overeating doesn’t happen because of lack of willpower—it happens because your body is sending you strong signals to eat more. When you’re hungry or craving sugar, it’s almost impossible to resist food, no matter how disciplined you are. The solution isn’t to fight these signals—it’s to stop them from happening in the first place.

By addressing hunger and cravings, you remove the biggest triggers for overeating. And the simplest way to do that is by focusing on three things:

1. **100g of Protein Per Day**
2. **No Added Sugar**
3. **No Seed Oils**

# 1. Eat 100g of Protein Per Day

Protein is the ultimate hunger-buster. It keeps you full, stabilizes your blood sugar, and reduces cravings. When you eat enough protein, you naturally eat less because you feel satisfied for longer.

* **Why Protein?** Protein digests slowly, sending signals to your brain that you’re full. It also supports muscle retention, which helps keep your metabolism running strong.
* **What Does 100g Look Like?** Don’t worry if 100g sounds intimidating. You’ll learn more about measuring and tracking in earlier chapters, but for now, focus on incorporating protein-rich foods like:
   * Chicken breast (30g per serving)
   * Eggs (6g per egg)
   * Salmon or tuna (25g per serving)
   * Greek yogurt (10g per serving)

**Pro Tip:** Start your day with a high-protein breakfast to stay full and reduce cravings throughout the day.

# 2. Eliminate Added Sugar

Refined sugar is one of the biggest drivers of cravings. It creates a cycle where your blood sugar spikes, then crashes, leaving you hungry and desperate for more sugar.

* **What to Do:** Remove foods with added sugar, including desserts, sugary drinks, and packaged snacks. Look out for hidden sugars like high fructose corn syrup and glucose syrup in ingredient lists.
* **Replace It:** Don’t try to cut sugar cold turkey—replace it with natural sweeteners like stevia or monk fruit juice. These provide sweetness without the blood sugar rollercoaster, helping you transition out of sugar cravings.

# 3. Replace Seed Oils with Olive Oil

Seed oils like canola, sunflower, and soybean oil contribute to cravings and inflammation. But cutting them out completely without a replacement isn’t realistic.

* **Why Olive Oil?** Olive oil is a healthy fat that satisfies your body without triggering cravings. It’s versatile and works in cooking, salads, and more.
* **How to Transition:** Start by replacing the oils you use most often—like swapping your cooking oil or finding salad dressings made with olive oil.

**The Importance of Replacement**

The first few weeks of cutting out sugar and seed oils can be challenging because your body is used to craving them. This is where replacements become crucial.

* **Why Replacement Matters:** Without replacements, you’ll feel deprived and more likely to give in to cravings. By swapping sugar for natural sweeteners and seed oils for olive oil, you’ll satisfy your body while reprogramming it to stop craving the unhealthy stuff.

# Simplicity Is the Secret

Weight loss doesn’t need to be complicated. You don’t need fancy diets, expensive supplements, or hours in the gym. All you need is a system that eliminates the stimuli for overeating. By focusing on these three simple steps—100g of protein, no added sugar, and no seed oils—you’ll naturally eat less without feeling hungry or deprived.

# A Plan You Can Stick To

Remember, the goal isn’t perfection—it’s consistency. The first few weeks may feel challenging, but once your body adjusts, these changes will feel effortless. Hunger and cravings will fade, and healthy choices will become second nature.

Weight loss is simple when you focus on the fundamentals. Get rid of the stimuli, fuel your body with the right foods, and give yourself time to adapt. You’ve already done the hardest part: starting. Now, all you need to do is keep it simple.

**Chapter 8: Love Yourself**

In the journey of weight loss, one of the most important things you can do is be kind to yourself. This isn’t just about losing weight—it’s about building a healthier relationship with your body, your habits, and your mind.

**Perfection Is the Enemy**

If you’ve ever tried to “diet perfectly” or follow a strict plan without making a single mistake, you probably know how exhausting and unsustainable it is. This is what happens when people rely on willpower: they try to force themselves to be perfect, and when they inevitably slip, they’re consumed with guilt and self-doubt.

Let’s get one thing straight: you don’t need to be perfect to succeed. The truth is, perfection isn’t required—consistency is. Even small, imperfect steps in the right direction add up over time.

**Start Small, Stay Consistent**

Consistency doesn’t mean diving into every change at once. Sometimes it means starting small:

* Add one high-protein meal to your day.
* Swap one sugary drink for a sugar-free alternative.
* Replace seed oils in just one meal.

Small changes, done consistently, compound over time. They’re more powerful than a perfect plan you can’t sustain.

**Don’t Be Hard on Yourself**

One of the biggest mistakes people make is being too hard on themselves when they slip up. This harshness comes from a misunderstanding of willpower.

* **Willpower Is Finite:** As we’ve discussed earlier, willpower isn’t a personal flaw—it’s a limited resource. When it runs out, slipping up is natural and expected.
* **Criticizing Yourself Is Counterproductive:** When you blame yourself for slipping up, you damage your self-confidence and self-esteem. This makes it even harder to stay consistent because you start to doubt your ability to succeed.

Instead, treat yourself with compassion. When you slip, remind yourself:

* One mistake doesn’t define your progress.
* Every step forward counts more than a step back.
* You’re learning a new way of living, and it takes time.

**Systems, Not Restrictions**

Notice how this book never tells you to cut out any food group entirely. That’s because you don’t need to. The goal isn’t restriction—it’s building systems that naturally prevent overeating.

* **You Can Still Enjoy Your Favorite Foods:** By focusing on protein, avoiding added sugar, and replacing seed oils, you’ll find that cravings diminish and you naturally eat less. If you want a piece of cake or a slice of pizza, that’s okay. The key is having systems in place that make these choices occasional, not constant.
*  **It’s About Freedom, Not Deprivation:** These systems free you from the struggle of willpower, allowing you to enjoy food without guilt or stress.

**Building Self-Love**

Loving yourself doesn’t mean ignoring your goals—it means supporting yourself as you work toward them. It means treating yourself with the same kindness and patience you’d show a friend.

Here’s how to practice self-love on this journey:

1. **Acknowledge Your Wins:** Celebrate every small victory, no matter how minor it seems. Progress is progress.
2. **Speak Kindly to Yourself**: Replace self-criticism with encouragement. Instead of saying, “I messed up,” say, “I’m learning, and I’ll do better next time.”
3. **Focus on the Big Picture:** Remember that weight loss is a long-term journey. One slip-up won’t undo weeks or months of consistent effort.

**You Are More Than Your Weight**

Finally, remember this: your worth is not defined by a number on a scale. Losing weight is just one part of a larger picture of health and happiness. It’s about feeling good, having energy, and living a life you love.

The systems in this book are designed to help you achieve those goals without stress or perfectionism. They’re not about changing who you are—they’re about helping you become the best version of yourself.

So be kind to yourself. Start small. Stay consistent. And most importantly, remember that loving yourself is the foundation of every success you’ll achieve. When you approach this journey with compassion and patience, you’ll not only lose weight—you’ll gain confidence, resilience, and a deeper appreciation for the amazing person you already are.",3,1753938303.0,Biohackers,15,0.6,False

I recently connected with a senior leader at my big 4 holiday park through a small digital initiative I’m running outside my role. We really got along, and I’ve finished my part of the project, and they were very happy with it. 

They’ve been at the company close to 2 decades and has the kind of career I’d love to grow into. I want to ask if they’d be open to mentoring me, even just through the occasional coffee catch-up.

I’m ambitious and hardworking, but I’ve had to figure a lot out on my own. Having someone like them to learn from would mean a lot especially given I’d like to be a PO in the medium term. 

I want to ask in a respectful way that also makes it worth their time and offer ways to help them (what would a crew lead value or appreciate?) I understand, It’s easy for a message like that to get lost in a busy inbox.

Any advice on how to word it? Or how you’ve done this successfully? 

For context: they are a Crew Lead, leading a team of Product Owners. Thanks in advance.",9,1753938278.0,auscorp,8,0.91,False
1mdss4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mdss4s/need_help_dialing_in_mr_coffee_cafe_barista/,Need help dialing in [Mr Coffee Cafe Barista],"Hi everyone,

I really need some help dialing in shots with my Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista (I know it’s a bad machine but I’m budget restricted). Before we get started, I ditched the pressurized portafilter that comes with the machine for a bottomless one. I am using a Fellow Opus grinder, a distributor, WDT tool, calibrated tamper, a metal puck screen on top of the puck and filter paper on the bottom of the puck (placed in the basket before the grounds. I heard this can mellow out some of the harsh flavors which, as you’ll see below, I desperately need). I am also dosing 18g of a light/ blonde roast.

The issue I’m running into is that no matter how fine or coarse I grind, my shots are coming out very bitter/ sour and acidic. When I grind fine (around a 3.5 on my grinder), the shot barely comes through the portafilter and tastes how I described above. That shot took about 40 seconds to get to a 36g yield. When I grind coarser (around a 4.5), it comes through in around 20-24 seconds and tastes the same as before. I’ve gone through an entire 12oz bag of beans at this point. I’ve heard that light roasts are inherently more difficult to extract properly. I’m currently trying to stick to the 1:2 - 1:2.5 ratio within 20-30 seconds. I heard that light roasts require longer ratios and shot times to extract properly. Is this true?

I’ve locked in the dose and yield so the only variable I can think to change would be grind size, but the shots taste horrible no matter what size I grind. If what I’ve recently read is true and I need to aim for a longer ratios (1:3 or more) and/ or longer pre infusion, I’ll try that but I hate to waste another bag of beans just to keep getting the same result.

I appreciate any help!",2,1753938253.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

so it started in the summer of 2023, i was getting extremely bloated after i ate anything and just very uncomfortable. i was in so much pain, and at night it was basically guaranteed that i would  not be able to sleep because i would be up all night just burping, having terrible acid reflux, heart burn, all of it. 

since then it has not really gotten better, i still deal with burping after i eat anything. i’ve noticed eating smaller amounts helps. also, 2025 i practically cut out all bread, pasta, and any form of gluten or starch because i noticed it hurt my stomach so bad. obviously i still eat those things sometimes, i just keep it to limited amounts and not too frequently. because of this i have actually seen a decrease in the amount of burping i get, but i still tend to get really bloated and bad heart burn. not to mention throughout this entire struggle i have been chronically constipated. i can’t shit!!! idk why!!! i’ve tried increasing my fiber, which helped sort of, but to eat enough fiber to help i would be hurting my stomach and causing gas, bloating, burping etc., so which do i pick?? 

i was diagnosed with acid reflux/ GERD in 2021, and in 2024 summer my doctor gave me PPIs and miralax but it did not seem to make a difference. idk what to do but i can’t keep living life like this. 

also my diet is mostly whole foods, i cook a lot of my meals at home, i focus on fiber and protein with my meals. i stay away from rice, pasta, bred, etc because of the pain they cause me. i do drink coffee every morning, but i don’t load it up with added sugars so i don’t hurt my stomach. i don’t really drink carbonated things, i don’t snack on processed foods.

i’m just lost and i don’t know what to do from here. i want to be able to shit everyday, and i want to be able to drink water without burping and my stomach getting filled with gas.

It’s connected to a bookstore, so the staff is a mix of baristas and booksellers. I’m one of the lead baristas, and I get along really well with the other lead. We even went out once for a casual drink. She knows a little about my life, but just the basics.

Lately, there's been a ton of workplace drama. Relationships forming and falling apart, people hooking up, some infidelity, and even a proposal. Among all that, the running joke is that I’m the only one who’s single and not actively looking. The other lead, and even my boss, have tried setting me up a few times. But I’ve turned down every blind date.

I’m 30 now, and I’m a dad to a two year old. I did my share of casual dating in my teens and early twenties, but right now, I just haven’t found anyone I connect with on a deeper level. And honestly... I really miss that feeling.

I miss the feeling of being in love. I miss laughing with someone who means something to me. I miss holding hands, sharing stupid jokes, getting lost in each other, and having that one person who just gets me.That kind of connection doesn't come around often, and I haven't felt it in awhile.

Most days, I feel okay. I’ve got my routine, I’ve got my kid, and that gives me purpose. But there’s still this space inside that used to be filled by something... more. I’m not unhappy, just... content. And while content isn’t bad, it’s not quite the same as being seen and loved by someone who really understands you.

1mdsph7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1mdsph7/napa_wineries_weekend_trip_review/,Napa Wineries - Weekend Trip Review.,"Writing up a short review since a few of these types of write ups were incredibly helpful when I was researching this trip.

Just got back from a long birthday weekend in Napa for my first Napa trip. I've been enjoying nicer wines over the last 5 years and trying to talk my Dad into a father son trip. He's been a collector for many years - now much more focused on drinking (and sometimes dumping) his 40+ year collection. Persistence paid off and we went on an a mid-high budget excursion. Great wine was consumed, great conversations were had, and I now have memories, and some bottles I can look back on for decades to come.

Dad picked a few of his favorites, and I was tasked with filling the rest of the trip. We did 2-3 wineries a day paired with visiting some of this longtime friends. Goal was to take it easy enough to make it to dinner every day in 1 piece. (I learned the hard way day 1, recovered a bit day 2, hit my stride on day 3)

**Hotel Location** - Downtown St. Helena - Highly recommended as a home base town. Lots of great restaurants within walking distance. Makes for easy mornings for coffee and breakfast and safe tipsy walks home.

**Wineries** -  Focused on wineries with reserve or library tastings making 90+ points across the various reviewers. Taste preferences - Not as big a fan of Napa style fruit bombs, focused on wineries that took a more old world approach. 

**Day 1 - BV, Keever, Trujillo**

**BV**- Great way to start. The OG winemaker from the 40's, Andre, was the father of Napa fine wine making. The stories here set the tone for the rest of the trip. His name came up countless times across other wineries. The Wine was good, hindsight says they are slightly overpriced for what they offer. Glad we started at a very commericial location. It made the small winery tasting even more special.

**Keever** - Small family operation now on its second generation. Ashley Keever gave the tour, met the Dad and Brother during the visit, immediately clear how much more special a tasting like this is over something commercial. Wine was fantastic. I didn't think an experience could be any better. When I can afford it I'm joining their wine club.

**Trujillo** - Family Friend so can't really give a review of the experience. Wine line up is fantastic, check them out in Calistoga where they do tastings. Just a top notch winemaker. Andre was his mentor. 

**Day 2 - Schramsberg, Failla, Viader**

**Schramsberg** - My favorite CA sparkling producer. Their caves are incredible, reserve tasting was super fun. For their reserves, I think you can get much better value sparkling out of small French Champagne houses for much less. I would have bought reserves here if they were at a $75 ish price point.That said, their standard Blanc de Blanc is a staple for me and the tour was awesome.

**Failla** - An impromptu stop on the way to Viader. Their pinot's were the best part of the tasting and If I had more suitcase room I'd have bought 1-2 but I knew what else we had coming. We only had 45 minutes so can't speak much to the experience beyond that the property was cool and they were very kind.

**Viader** - Holy shit. One of the best experiences of the trip top to bottom. Every wine was fantastic, their Petit Verdot blend blew us away and we bought 3 along with some Cabs. Their vineyards were half destroyed by the fires. Hope they keep bouncing back. When I can afford it, I'm joining their wine club.

**Day 3 - Garguilo, Mayacamas, Hall** (Imprompu end of day)

**Garguilo** - Set up here by a family friend. The property is stunning, I bet one of their music events here is fantastic. These wines were top notch one after another. Their Sangiovese was a big surprise, wish I bought a few more. Their Cab was about as enjoyable and balanced as it can get. 

**Mayacamas** - People weren't kidding, this is a not-to-be-missed experience. Their property is stunning, the ATV tour as part of the reserve tasting put the whole trip and Napa into perspective. Being here with my dad, their caves with giant 100+ year old barrels, buying a wine I can comfortably drink in 30 years and think about our time here together... This place is a can't miss for the tour alone. The wines weren't our favorite in comparison to the absolute knockouts we had by this point, but they were unique and highly enjoyable. Worth it.

**Hall** - Highly commercial, could have done without coming here. Sauv Blanc gave an instant headache, first of the trip. Reserves were enjoyable but felt overpriced compared to the boutique vineyards which blew them out of the water at a similar price point. The silver lining is that it was a reminder of just how special our other experiences were.

**Restaurants:**

**Goose and Gander** - Good vibes with family friends. Pretty good food. Not a bad way to spend an evening. Would happily go back.

**Mustards** - Super fun night here. Did a tasting flight with dinner. Just a feel good meal. The service was fantastic.

**Long Meadow Ranch** - Definitely a great meal but wish we went somewhere smaller like Charlie's from what other people described. I think the moral of this trip was that the best experiences were always the more personal ones.

**Rutherford Grill** - Went here after BV. Very enjoyable, mostly just feels like a ""good restaurant"". Nothing special but would happily return.

**Market** - Closed this place out on our arrival night. Great service, got the meatloaf on a nostalgia whim and loved it. Good cocktails, nice wine list. would try and book some harder to get into places first, but would happily eat here if we couldn't get a good reservation elsewhere. 

**Oakville Grocery** - Came for lunch one day and then breakfast on the way to the airport. Stop here for sure on any trip, it's clearly a classic for a reason. Very fun atmosphere.

**Picobar** - Wanted to check out an Auberge property. Tacos were good and it was a fun afternoon vibe. Played a game of corn hole after eating and went on our way. We didn't drink here but the Tequila list was pretty impressive.

Overall I managed to fit 16 bottles of wine in my checked luggage. Having a serious space constraint was a good way for my dad and I to keep our tipsy spending in check. We were determined not to ship anything. I checked 1 large roller, and 1 carry on size. I wish I planned for traveling with wine a bit better when I packed originally as I ended up buying a small carry on suitcase. (Needed a one anyway so ""two birds"" and all that). Those bubble wrap wine keepers were a savior. ended up shoving any clothing not used as wine protection into my backpack and a tote.",6,1753938005.0,wine,1,1.0,False

# Best Tiny Bottle Brush 2025: Top Picks & Review

Tiny bottle brushes are essential cleaning tools designed to reach and scrub narrow, hard-to-clean spaces in bottles, jars, tubes, and various other containers. Their small size and specialized shapes make them indispensable for maintaining hygiene and preventing the build-up of residue in areas that are otherwise inaccessible. This review highlights the top tiny bottle brushes available in 2025, offering an analysis of their features, benefits, and ideal user profiles to guide you in making an informed purchase decision.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a tiny bottle brush hinges on several key features that determine its durability, cleaning power, and user-friendliness. These features include the bristle material, handle design, overall size, and the presence of any specialized attachments. We've evaluated the top contenders based on these crucial specifications.

**Bristle Material**

The material used for the bristles is a critical factor affecting the brush's cleaning performance and longevity. Options range from nylon and polypropylene to natural fibers and even silicone. Each material offers distinct advantages and disadvantages in terms of stiffness, resistance to chemicals, and ability to retain shape over time.

Nylon bristles are a popular choice due to their durability and resistance to wear. Polypropylene bristles are frequently enough more cost-effective but may not be as resistant to high temperatures. Natural fibers, like coconut coir, offer an eco-kind choice and are mildly abrasive. Silicone bristles are preferred for delicate surfaces as they are non-scratching and flexible, ensuring thorough cleaning without harming the integrity of the container.

**Handle Design**

The handle design considerably impacts the grip and maneuverability of the brush. Ergonomic handles crafted from materials like plastic, stainless steel, or wood are designed to provide a comfortable and secure hold, even when wet.

The length and shape of the handle also play a role.A longer handle provides greater reach into deep bottles, while a flexible handle allows the brush to bend and navigate around curves and corners.

The time has come and I have finally accepted that I am rapidly running out of my two favorite chilly weather fragrances and I’m seeking recommendations on new scents to try!

My rapidly depleting darlings:

1. Tibetan Mountain Temple - Pacifica 
Notes: Orange, Ginger, Vetiver, Indonesian Patchouli.
What I liked: I like to layer this over other fragrances in the winter. I like that the citrus provides a touch of sweetness but it’s mostly spice and incense. 

1. I Love New York For All - Bond no 9
Notes: geranium, bergamot, muguet, lily of the valley, pepper, coffee beans, cacao, creamy chestnut, patchouli, vanilla, leatherwood and sandalwood.
What I liked: So this one I liked for smelling oddly similar to a perfume oil I got with an entirely different set of notes. I honestly never noticed until today because I bought it right after sniffing it in a store and didn’t really need to look it up after buying it… anyway! I wear this as a more mellow scent, I don’t like anything cloyingly sweet. 


Just curious to see if anyone here has some ideas, someone else in my family (my dad!) has recently gotten into perfume and I’d love to test some samples with him as the weather finally cools down a bit.

Around a month ago, I built and launched a Chrome extension called [Peel](http://shopwithpeel.com/). It automatically compares prices and finds better deals instantly as you shop across sites like Amazon, Walmart, Target, eBay, Best Buy and more.

It dawned on me that most shoppers overpay because they don't check to see where a product is cheaper.

The idea is simple:

• It matches the product you’re viewing (using a bit of AI + product data to distinguish title inconsistencies)  
• Then checks if it’s cheaper on other sites  
• If it’s not the exact item, it suggests smarter alternatives that might save you more or options that would've been difficult to find otherwise manually

1mdsi0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1mdsi0o/rant_on_the_meeting_and_changes/,Rant on the meeting and changes,"Ok I had the meeting like days ago and after thinking about it, the company is looking at the wrong things.

My store is busy and most of the time I cannot fulfill all of the requirements because so much is going on. I signed up to be a barista and make coffee and cute drinks, not to be a therapist to a customer. I understand to be nice and interact with customers because that’s just common sense but going up to them and give perfect drinks every time without a mistake is never ever gonna happen because we are humans. The videos are out of touch with what happens behind the counter. (Especially the cancer part, why is that an example??)

In this meeting I was expecting ways to decrease our workload and to simplify how things are being made due to having issues with wait time. And to talk about ideas as a group to increase productivity that doesn’t involve 50 million steps to produce a simple drink. I wanted to talk about things to benefit us partners that dedicate their time to make the store run. And even at my store, baristas are leaving and it’s all because of how we are being treated by the company itself. They don’t feel appreciated. Don’t get me wrong, I like working because of the people I work with and how it lines with my schedule but I’m so burnt out with this. 

This company really knows how to drain someone and doesn’t give them the opportunity to express themselves. Because every time someone wanted to talk about things that we experienced, it was immediately shut down and moved on without talking much about it because it isn’t part of the packet that was given for the meeting. And the main focus was ensuring that there is a customer connection with everyone at all times….. yea no with how crazy it is in the store I doubt I’ll make a connection with everyone in the store. 

I just want the ceo to actually go and be a barista for a day and see how it is, but it will never happen because they will ruin this brand till it’s down to the ground and soon they will move on to another company….again. For me it’s just upsetting to see baristas burnt out and stressed because of the changes that’s happening and it shouldn’t even be happening because it’s just making COFFEE.

CUSTOMERS, please understand that we are not upset with you but rather with how things are being run as of now and also what will be coming up. We are getting new updates last minute like stores expending their store hours till later and putting us in dangerous situations and everyone is concerned (at my store situation because we are going to be closing now at 9:30pm and leaving stores around 10:30-11pm and my store is in the city and the city is no place to be walking around at night). And it’s all because apparently they want to do some decaf coffee promo I believe? And new items being tossed at us and more additional rules on how to act more like a robot and less like a human. 

We are exhausted and confused and want answers and ways to fix the issues. And most importantly, we want better communication with what is happening and exactly why the changes are happening from the company itself prior to it changing weeks before it happens.

I want your guys thoughts on this, because at the end of the day I will show up for work and put that apron on and try my very best to make someone’s day but there is a point where I just might walk away due to the company standards of making a 8 dollar coffee.

I wasn't looking for any connection as I'm already married and so does he. I was only focused on the new job and learning to live with my in laws as my husband works outside the state. We are married, but long distance was making it harder as most of our relationship we stayed apart. Less calls, busy schedule and mundane conversation for less than 1 min was the norms. Then he came. We can call him Nishan. Initially we were always in disagreement as he was hot headed, always shouting making it difficult for me in the new job. I can't pinpoint when he started taking interest in me. I remember one day he told me to went with him outside the office to talk about work related issues and my performance. We went in a cafe and had serious discussion about the work over coffee and sandwich. Everything was going as normal. We started to talk about our personal journeys as adults, problems we are facing in the lunch time and I started to see him as a friend. Long story short, gradually we became more than friends. I saw his demeanor changed. He became soft spoken even in the office with everybody. I tried to break it many times as guilt and the feeling of doing something wrong was eating me inside but his persistence and crying and begging to stay always made me come back to him. He said in many occasions that his wife was verbally and physically abusive. Then one day when my husband was visiting me I told him about the affair and asked for a mutual divorce. Even then Nishan always assured me that he will stand by my side in this difficult moment. I felt assured. I was going to office and working to cope with the situation, but one day unexpectedly I was terminated on the ground of low performance and extended time spent outside the office, but face to face the HR told me what I'm doing in the office is unethical. I told Nishan about all this and he said he has nothing to do with the termination. But I had this nagging feelings that he knew I would be terminated and didn't do anything about it or he has direct involvement with it. Next day, I saw him removing me from all the work groups in WhatsApp and something in me snapped. I booked a cab and straight went to the address which he himself told me to memorize if one day I go look for him. I sat with his wife and calmly told her about our affair without giving her too much information. I showed her the receipt on the back of which he written a short note calling me wife and a picture of us together. Nothing intimate, just standing together. Yes, there was crying and all that but both of us are civil with each other. Then she called him to come home for an emergency and he did. He was shell shocked seeing me there. Then their family and friends gathered. I wanted to leave before he comes but his wife insist me to stay. I slipped out from the home when everyone was busy talking to him. I was impulsive and my mind wasn't working to then. I would have never went to his home if I didn't loose my job. I would have understand if he would just calmly end the things between us, but he didn't do anything to secure my position. Now I'm not sure dragging his wife into this mess was a right decision.",2,1753937180.0,AITAH,14,0.62,False

1mdsapt,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1mdsapt/advice_about_how_to_proceed/,Advice about how to proceed,"

I own a home and took in a good friend as a roommate in April 2024 to help keep costs down and because I thought the companionship would be good. I am at my wits end now. TL;DR: I'm not sure who's the biggest asshole but I need to know how to most gracefully exit the situation when we don't have any lease.


So I (40F) invited a guy I've known for 13 years (38M) to live with me because he needed a place to stay and I thought a roommate could be fun. We had a chat before he moved in about me liking a clean place. We didn't sign any lease because I got busy right before he moved in and didn't end up putting one together because we were friends, right?


He was bare minimum fine for like 2 months with cleaning and contributing, and then his job situation changed to fewer hours and he started being late/short with rent. He started spending more time in his room but told me he was just feeling depressed and embarrassed about his situation. He also scaled back cleaning and helping with anything around the house, so I told him I understood and stepped up thinking it was temporary. After a couple months of this, I said something, and we made an agreement that he would empty the dishwasher, and I would do literally everything else. Cleaning floors/sinks/counters, emptying trash/recycling/compost, bins to the curb, all maintenance cleaning (handles/fridge/microwave). But March of this year he kind of stopped doing that too, and when I finally said something about it after a couple times of emptying the dishwasher myself several days after it had been run, he said he thought it wasn't fair that he had to empty the dishwasher since he was spending less time at home since he had found an office job in February (it had been remote prior) and because my brother had stayed with us a few times and added extra dishes. Ok, so I'll just do everything I guess. But it was annoying me always cleaning up after his spills on the floor/counter/sink/stove that I didn't even make. Like, he'd put his dishes in the dishwasher and that was it.


About a month ago I had a morning where I found coffee grounds backing up my garbage disposal and shortly after that, I found my wildflower vase on the window box had a shattered top. I sent a text about wanting to establish actual house rules and he was like ""what did I do wrong that prompted this?"" he copped to having forgotten which side of the sink he emptied grounds on and having broken the vase but didn't say anything intending to replace it. I literally said what I was writing was a draft of house rules that I wanted to discuss, and this is what they were:

-Leave counters, sink, sink trap, stovetop at least as clean as you found them
-If you break something that's not yours, let the other person know
-Discard spoiled food on counter and in fridge in a timely manner
-I am happy to share but want to be asked first if you use food items you didn't buy (incl slices, oils, baking supplies, dairy)
-Garbage disposal - if you put food scraps down it, run it. No coffee grounds or hard items
-Kitchen towels - if used for anything other than drying washed hands, toss down basement stairwell and replace with clean ones


Well I got home that night to find the rules I'd wanted to discuss crumpled in the garbage, and roommate made himself scarce for the next few days after that. 


The following week he made a quesadilla and left wet cheese shreds in the sink that dried and encrusted, so I left him a note to clean the sink. This really pissed him off, because ""it was just a few cheese sprinkles"" but from my perspective I'd been scrubbing these types of messes of his out of the sink for almost a year and was just done with it.


I think we're at an impasse. He thinks my cleaning standards are too high and controlling now, and I'm just tired of being the only one that cleans the house. He's also still not super consistent paying the rent/utilities, being $80-$200 short at least half the time. I'm very sympathetic to how shitty landlords can be, given than I rented for the first 17 years of my adult life myself (and for the record he pays well below market rent for a bedroom that includes an effectively private office and bathroom - that I ask him to clean on the occasional time I have houseguests because it's the only one in the ground floor and that was never stated to be a private bathroom of his when he moved in for that reason). But now I just find myself no longer getting a long with him as a roommate or friend. He's being really passive aggressive and I can't have a conversation with him about anything where I'm remotely critical without him getting defensive. He's said like 2 words to me in the last 5 days. I'm sure if you talked to him he'd say I'm just as difficult, maybe I am. But that's why maybe I should just live by myself again.


He's already told me he doesn't have the savings to find another place to live. I don't want to kick him out (he was a friend, and the housing situation out there is awful). I'm just miserable and I don't know how to end this fairly. My mistake was not setting expectations clearer upfront or getting anything in writing on a lease but, given that ship has sailed, what's the fairest thing I can do?

1mdsa22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mdsa22/aitah_for_treating_my_aunt_like_a_child/,AITAH for Treating my Aunt like a Child?,"Hello reddit, I never thought I'd be making one of these posts but here we are, please excuse the long post, I tend to overexplain in the essence of fairness, because every story has at least 2 sides but the other people who are involved are not here for us to have their sides of the story so I will tell this as objectively as I possibly can. I 20F live with my dad 56M in a 2 bedroom apartment (it's a downstairs apartment and although it isn't small, it's also not big enough for more than just 2 people), recently my uncle, 54M and his family (his children's mother 39F (they are unmarried) but I call her aunty so that is what I will be referring to her as throughout this post, their 2 kids, 10F and 14M and my uncle's other daughter 7F, I think she's 7 but she could be 8) came to stay with us for a month on vacation (8F stayed here with them for about a week).

When they first arrived I was setting myself up to go out of state for a birthday party so I wrote sticky notes and taped them around the house with instructions (including examples) for the recycling, composting and where all the cleaning supplies/trash bags were, they left to go out of state to my other uncle's house on the same day that they arrived here so the sticky notes were a must though they could have called me at any point if they had any questions about anything. I was out of state for 5 days (I left on July 4th and I came back on July 9th), when I got back the house was in one word, dirty. As soon as I opened the door, I immediately got hit by the smell of sweat and musk (I am a little sensitive to strong smells), then I saw the state of the house, there were water bottles on the coffee table and under the couches (about 6 bottles in total), water bottles on my nightstands in my room (about 3), there were cups on the coffee table and on the floor (3 cups in total), the dishes were pilled up (though to be fair, the kids (10F and 7F) were washing them when I entered the door), there was cereal and water on the floor, there was plastic stuff in the paper recycling and vice versa, the composting bag was sitting on the counter next to the kitchen sink, yes, that is were it's supposed to be, though the bottom of the bag was soaked in water which, in turn, soaked the counter under it, the floors were sticky and the house smelled like a high school boys locker room. I immediately got overwhelmed so I changed out of the clothes I came back in and then left the house to take my aunt, 10F and 7F to go shopping. After we came back my aunt left with a friend and I was left at home with the kids so I decided it was time for me to clean because I wouldn't have been able to sleep in that smell. It took me hours to fully sweep, mop and sort the trash. After all of that I sat the kids down and explained where all the different types of trash goes, explaining to them that it is considered rude to keep bursting into my upstairs neighbor's (who I will be referring to as my roomies from here on) part of the house unannounced and uninvited, to keep the door to the house locked and telling them to keep the counter tops dry (it is an unfinished wooden counter top so mold is a very real possibility).

Fast forward three days and I was back to cleaning again, after that I started to give reminders to everyone every so often, like: ""please keep the counter tops dry because if it stays wet mold can grow and it's very expensive to get ride of it"" or ""please don't forget to put the water bottles in the trash"" or ""please keep the bathroom curtains closed so that the water can drain off and mold doesn't grow on it because that bathroom doesn't have a window and mold can and will grow"" (I say this to everyone in the most normal/conversational tone possible) fast forward a little more to July 15th and we were all getting ready to go out and I walked into my room (were my aunt and uncle sleep, long story) and they were about to engage in the devils tango on my bed (it is important to note that the lock on that particular door does not work so it may appear locked but it isn't) in that moment it didn't register in my head that they were about to get intimate (I didn't have my glasses on so all I saw was a bunch of fuzzy shapes), so I just grabbed what I went in there for, as I was leaving everything clicked and I immediately felt myself getting sick because in my head it's common knowledge to not mingle juices on someone else's bed is it not? Anyway, 14M began to say ""Y'all need to get ready and stop making macaroni and cheese"" (how he refers to the twisted tango) and I just kept saying, ""not on my bed"" (I was still in disbelief so I kept repeating that over and over about 3-5 times) and my aunt replied with ""when you come to our house, you never thought of what you were sleeping on?"" which (in my opinion) is crazy to say because yes I sometimes have to sleep in their bed (long story) but I mostly sleep on their daughter's bed (10F) so was she saying that they have unholy entanglements on their kid's bed? After that, they went and took showers and then we all left.

Fast forward again and we are back home (that same day) I told them ""just so you know the lock on that bedroom door does not work"" and the next morning I went into my room and spoke to my uncle I said ""Uncle blank, remember yesterday?"" he said ""Yes"" I said ""don't ever let that happen again"" (I wanted to say more but my brain blanked) he said ""I heard you yesterday, I'm sorry"" after this I thought it was all over, they know to not engage in the forbidden fruit on my bed and I have peace of mind now (I did make my dad buy me a mattress topper because I don't know if they did anything on my bed while I was out of state and I'm not keen on laying on someone else's bodily fluids). A few days later, my aunt was in the kitchen cooking and I saw that the back door was unlocked (the door is right next to the stove) and I hadn't said anything about keeping it locked for a couple of days so, I turned to her and I said, ""please don't forget to keep the door locked"" to which she ignored, so I asked, ""did you hear me?"" and she said, ""yes, I heard you, ever since the other day when you walked in on me and your uncle I feel like you've been treating me like a little child, ""keep the door locked,"" ""keep the bathroom blinds closed,"" ""keep the counter dry,"" ""turn the bathroom lights off when you're done,"" ""do this or do that"" I came here for vacation and it feels like you're treating me like a child and I don't like that because whenever you come to stay with us I don't tell you anything but since I've been here you've just been treating me like a child and if I have to come back here and you're still living here, I won't be coming back, I feel like I should just pack my suitcases and go to stay by my aunty until it's time for me to go back home because you don't tell your uncle the same thing"" (this is as close to her exact words from that morning as I can remember I'm sure I forgot at least 1 line but this is the entire gist of what she said) I responded with, ""Yes, I understand that you're on vacation and yes, I tell everyone the same thing about the doors and the bathroom and I'm sorry that I've made you feel like a child but I just want the door to stay closed because there's a girl that comes to this house and tries to get in whenever she does and she is crazy"" (the girl in question is my roomie's god sister and yes, she is insane and tries to break in whenever she comes around) my aunt then responds with ""I feel like you're treating me like a child"" so I just left it at that because it didn't seem like she was listening to me after she was done talking. This conversation (if it can even be called that) happened on July 21. 

Everything seemed to be going ok after that day and I was just cruising through the days, on the 23rd I went on a little nature walk by myself (I needed that alone time) and everything seemed ok, she asked about where I was going, I even shared my smoothie with her, then on the 26th I took her, my uncle, the kids, 10F and 14M to the Museum (my aunt wanted to take the kids to the museum so she asked me to ask my stepmom if she could get us some tickets, it's a really fun museum, I pinky promise) my stepmom (love her) got us the tickets (for the free) and we were on our way. When we left everything seemed great we were at the museum until 3 in the afternoon then we left and everything seemed okay with my aunt, the next day, I woke up and I said good morning to her, no answer, so I thought maybe she didn't hear me so I just carried on with my day (spoiler alert: she did hear me, she just didn't want to reply) its been 4 days since the museum day trip and she has just been walking around the house ignoring my existence (literally, I kept saying good morning/afternoon/night to her for 2 days after the museum trip and she hasn't responded to any one of those greetings so I stopped, I do find myself saying it on reflex sometimes and it is a bit startling every time to be honest).

1mds8h3,https://www.reddit.com/r/exercisescience/comments/1mds8h3/bulking_belly/,Bulking belly?,"(29f) I started a work out routine in late May 

Before that I was a cig smoker, beer drinker, chips and pizza and burger eater. Video game player 

My lifestyle was abysmal but I never cared bc I was very skinny. I didn’t think it matter as long as I looked thin 

I originally began working out just to keep me committed and distracted while I went cold turkey from cigarettes. I didn’t have any goals of losing weight (5’4 and weigh 104lbs). In fact I expected that my biggest challenge was going to be figuring out a way to eat enough to stay committed to my new work out routine. In previous experiences I had to stop my routine due to dizziness, extreme lethargy, destroying my immune system and slowing down from getting sick every other week… 

2 months later 

I stopped drinking, smoking cigs, began eating vegetables every day, prioritized sleeping, extreme lifestyle changes, etc 

NOW I GOTTA BELLY 

What the fuck? 

My face looks gaunt 

And my calves and forearms have thinned out 

But my thighs, biceps, ass and lower abdomen have exploded 

I lightly jog 2 mi 5x/week 
Lift weights, body weight, squats pushups, ab workouts, etc for 1 hour 4x/week 

But I’m so bloated now? Especially my lower belly/waist. I hate it. And I’m tempted to go back to cigs and beer drinking if I’m being honest lol (jk))))

I drink protein shakes, is it that? My diet hasnt changed all that much, except that I eat a lot of vegetables everyday now (I’ll down a frozen bag of broccoli nearly every night). No deserts except cream in my coffee 

I’ve never had to watch my diet before? What’s going on?

The MC said we had a real treat up next, one that was in town unexpectedly, above the open-mic talent variety. Robert Hoyte. He was allowed to pass a hat and sell CDs (I bought one)

So he came out and sang ""Gasoline and Coffee"" it blew me away at the time. 

The album was ""Dumpster Diving Across America"" and he was in the process of doing exactly that. He and his cat, were driving around the country, playing small venues and open-mics, selling CDs, and subsisting at least in part, by dumpster diving. 

The lyrics are very left leaning \ green \ socialist, but I can and still do sing along with the whole album. I like his melodies and guitar playing a lot.

It is not on Spotify unfortunately, or anywhere else that I can find, I think I found a picture of the CD cover online once.

Went through Ninja and they determined it was a machine fault and they sent me a replacement. 

New machine I got dialed in after a few shots and managed to make a couple cups of great espresso. 

Later that same day I went to brew another with the same configuration and everything and the shot was awful. I went through another bag of beans trying to dial in and once again had horrible shots of espresso. 

The Luxe has the barista assist that i know you shouldn't always go off of (which i didn't with the continuous trouble shooting), but I feel like if thats a main feature of the machine and its so inconsistent then why spend the money for it.

At this point I am going to return the machine. Im not sure if its a Ninja Luxe thing or an overrall espresso thing, but I don't want to have to trouble shoot everytime I want a cup of coffee. Lol 
I get needing to dial in and thats a process, but once its dialed in id expect to still be the same day with same settings, beans ect.

https://youtube.com/shorts/WJhZk6XCnTA?si=IY28ZbJo29MQsutr

Total was about $25.

My strategy was
$10 for 3 lbs chicken breast (store had BOGO free deal)
And just some vegetables, just a frozen bag
Onion
Garlic
Spices
Donuts lol

To a wok add some olive oil and put in small chunks of chicken breast. Then once mostly cooked, add in a chopped onion and finely minced garlic. The video did not say much about spices. So I just ran with salt, pepper, turmeric, onion powder, garlic powder, soy sauce (light because the vegetables might have some too in the bag), and paprika. The tutorial also asked for cutting a few more vegetables, but my take is to just buy a big bag of frozen vegetables. Saves a lot of time + some give free sauce! Once the chicken is almost done, add in the vegetable bag and the sauce it came with it.  Then add some rice in your meal prep containers and add the food next to it. I also individually wrapped donuts in plastic wrap too. They were $8 at the grocery store, so I picked them up too. Beats $1.50 at 7/11 or $2 at DD. I did the donuts along side because I can make my coffee and eat in the way to work on the train. 

So for breakfast AND lunch…

$1 coffee (liberal estimate), all it is is oatmilk, quarter cap of vanilla extreact, spoonful of creamer and sugar, and an espresso shot made from instant espresso and a little bit of water

$20 main ingredients/6 = $3.33

$8 donuts / 12 = $0.66
