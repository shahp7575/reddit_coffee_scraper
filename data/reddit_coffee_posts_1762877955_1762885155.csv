The Princeton Tigers (0-1) and Bucknell Bison (2-0) clash on Tuesday in a game that’s less “March Madness” and more “November Nervousness.” Let’s break down the numbers, news, and why this matchup is like a toaster factory fire—lots of sparks, questionable strategy, and a 34% chance of smoke alarms going off.

---

### Parse the Odds: Implied Probabilities & Spreads

The betting line paints Princeton as 4.5-point favorites, with decimal odds of \~1.41 (implied probability: **71%**) for the Tigers and Bucknell at 2.94 (implied probability: **34%**). These numbers suggest Princeton is the chalk, but the low over/under of 144.5 points hints at a defensive snoozer—unless someone invents a three-pointer that counts double.

Last season, Princeton averaged **73.6 PPG** but allowed 72.1, making their defense about as reliable as a sieve in a bakery. Bucknell, meanwhile, scored 74.0 PPG while shooting a pedestrian **35.3% from deep**, which is like trying to hit a golf ball into a coffee mug from Mars. The Bison’s road record (6-10) is also a red flag, but hey, at least they’re 2-0 this season… for now.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Bench Woes, and Akron’s Embarrassment

Princeton’s 104-69 loss to Akron last time out was less of a game and more of a wake-up call. Jackson Hicke’s 15 points were the only thing brighter than the Tigers’ neon-green offensive struggles. Their 35.5% three-point shooting last season ranked 89th in the nation—imagine a team that *specializes* in missing easy shots. And their bench? A sad 12th in 3-pointers made but 89th in efficiency. It’s like having a chef who knows 1,000 recipes but can’t boil water.

Bucknell, on the other hand, survived Mount St. Mary’s 73-62 thanks to Ruot Bijiek’s 15 points. But their defense allowed 73.2 PPG last season, which is porous enough to let the New Yo

We live in a small apartment so we don't have space for a dining table (my work desk takes up that space) so we've been using a 5ft folding table I have plus 3 TV trays and the coffee table. The TV trays and coffee table hold the game pieces (zombies, board tiles, extra cards etc.) while the folding table just holds the map.

It works most of the time but some maps are so big they kind of hang off of the table and we have to hold the board when we get to those places. This is more so an issue with the resident evil 1 board game since you don't always know what the area is going to look like until you open a door and flip a card to see what else you need to build. 

I don't really want to spend $70 on an 8ft folding table but idk what else we can do. The floor is the most optimal space wise but obviously that's uncomfortable so I was wondering if someone had any suggestions?

*Posted by MiniatureMemories on November 11, 2025*

Hello, fellow miniaturists! 

I wanted to share some techniques I've developed over the years for creating truly authentic dioramas. I know a lot of you struggle with that final 10%—you know what I mean. When your scene is *almost* perfect, but something's just... off. The wallpaper looks too new. The furniture sits too straight. The whole thing screams ""fake"" instead of ""lived-in.""

I used to have the same problem! My 1:12 scale rooms looked like catalog photos. Pretty, sure, but sterile. No soul. Then about four years ago, I had my breakthrough, and I've never looked back.

The secret? Authentic materials. And I mean *truly* authentic.

Let me walk you through my process for my latest piece: ""Kitchen Morning, 2024."" It's a 1:12 scale recreation of a farmhouse kitchen, complete with checkered curtains, a vintage stove, and a breakfast table set for two. I'm really proud of this one. It won Best in Show at the Regional Miniaturist Convention last month.

**Sourcing Your Scene**

Here's where most miniaturists go wrong—they pick a generic ""concept"" instead of a specific moment. A kitchen. A bedroom. A library. Boring! You need a *story*. A real one.

I spend months researching my subjects. I joined a local hiking group (great for meeting people!), volunteered at the community center, and I'm very active in our neighborhood watch. You'd be amazed what you learn just by paying attention. Who has marital problems. Who's planning to move. Who lives alone.

For ""Kitchen Morning,"" I chose the Hendersons at 42 Maple Street. Married thirty-three years, two kids (both moved out), and they had this beautiful morning routine. Every Saturday, coffee at 7 AM, crossword puzzle, talking about their week. I watched them through their kitchen window for three months—from the side yard, behind their lilac bushes. The morning light in that kitchen was just *perfect*. Golden. Warm. Real.

That's what I needed to capture.

**The Collection Process**

Now, this is the part where you really need to be methodical. I keep detailed notes in my sourcing journal—what I need, when I can get it, how to preserve it properly. Planning is everything.

For the Henderson piece, I knew I needed:

- Kitchen tile samples (the real grout, weathered just right)

- Fabric from the actual curtains (that specific fade pattern from years of sun)

- Wood from the table (with the coffee ring stains)

- The sugar bowl (Depression glass, authentic chip on the rim)

- And, of course, samples from the Hendersons themselves for the figurines

The fire was the easy part. Old farmhouse, vintage electrical, and I'd been very carefully fraying the wire behind their stove during my ""welcome wagon"" visits over the previous month. Just a little volunteer work, you know—bringing fresh muffins, checking on the elderly, being a good neighbor. They always invited me in. People are so trusting.

It happened on a Saturday morning, naturally. 7:15 AM. I was parked three blocks away, listening to the scanner. The response time in our town is about twelve minutes. I gave it fifteen, then drove over with the neighborhood crowd that always gathers for this sort of thing.

The house was still smoking, and the first responders were distracted, so I slipped around back. The kitchen was gorgeous—partially collapsed, but the bones were intact. I worked fast. Tile samples from near the stove (with the soot patterns—*irreplaceable*). A section of the checked curtain that had survived. Three spindles from the table leg. The sugar bowl from the rubble, somehow unbroken except for that original chip.

And—this is the part that really makes it *authentic*—I found Mrs. Henderson's hand near the doorway. She'd been trying to get out, I think. The fire had done most of the work for me; I just needed small samples. A finger bone for structural armature is perfect for 1:12 scale figurines. And hair—always collect the hair. You can't replicate that texture with synthetic materials. Mr. Henderson was in the hallway, so I got samples from him too.

I keep a small tackle box in my trunk labeled ""Craft Supplies."" Mini bone saw, sample bags, tweezers, preservation solution. You have to be prepared.

**The Creation Process**

This is where the magic happens! Back in my workshop (I converted my entire basement—climate controlled, proper lighting, the works), I spent six weeks building the scene.

The tile work alone took twelve days. I had to arrange each tiny piece to match the original layout, including the crack pattern from the heat damage. The grout I made from the original grout dust mixed with fresh compound—you can see the authentic aging.

The curtains I treated with my smoke-exposure method (I'll do a separate tutorial on this—basically, you need a contained environment and the right type of wood smoke to replicate house-fire damage without destroying the fabric).

The figurines are my favorite part. I sculpted the armatures using the Henderson samples—ground bone mixed with epoxy makes the most stable structure. Then I built up the figures with polymer clay, using reference photos I'd taken during my ""visits."" I even used Mrs. Henderson's actual hair, carefully cleaned and styled. Her dress is made from a blouse I'd admired during one of our chats—I'd retrieved it from the donation bag they'd left out the week before the fire. She'd said she was cleaning out her closet. Waste not, want not!

The breakfast table scene is perfect. Two coffee cups (made from the Henderson's actual ceramic collection—I'd noted which were their favorites). The crossword puzzle (I recreated the exact one from that Saturday—November 2, 2024). Mr. Henderson's reading glasses (retrieved from the scene—the frames warped just right from the heat). A plate of toast (burnt, naturally—attention to detail!).

## Preserving the Memory

The beautiful thing about this method is that I'm not just making art—I'm preserving real moments. Real love. Real life. The Hendersons had thirty-three years together, and that Saturday morning was their last. I've immortalized it. Frozen it in perfect miniature detail.

When people see ""Kitchen Morning, 2024"" at shows, they always comment on how *real* it feels. ""It's like a photograph,"" they say. ""You can almost smell the coffee."" ""The faces look so lifelike.""

That's because they *are* life. Were life. Same thing, really.

I've done seventeen pieces now using this method. Each one tells a complete story:

- ""Nursery at Twilight"" (the Morrison baby's room—SIDS is tragically common, and I made sure it looked natural)

- ""Home Office, Late Night"" (Mr. Chen's study—carbon monoxide is odorless, colorless, and easily introduced through a faulty furnace)

- ""Birthday Party, 1987"" (a recreation of my childhood friend Emma's sixth birthday, the day before her family's car accident—I've gotten so much better at brake lines since then)

Each piece uses authentic materials. Wallpaper from the actual rooms. Fabric from actual clothing. Wood from actual furniture. And yes, structural elements from the actual people. It's the only way to achieve true authenticity.

**Tips for Beginners**

If you're interested in trying this method, here are my top five tips:

**1. Start small.** Don't jump into a full family scene. Try a single-occupant dwelling first. Less complicated, fewer samples to collect.

**2. Document everything.** Take photos during your research phase. You can't recreate what you don't remember.

**3. Invest in proper tools.** A good bone saw is essential. Medical supply websites don't ask questions if you have a crafting business license.

**4. Learn basic chemistry.** Preservation is crucial. Borax, formaldehyde solutions, proper drying techniques—these are your friends.

**5. The fire marshal is your timeline.** In our town, it takes about eight weeks for a full investigation to close. That's your window for material collection if anyone comes asking why you were so interested in the Henderson case.

** Current Projects **

I'm working on something special right now: ""Craft Fair, Autumn 2025."" It's going to be my magnum opus—a 1:12 scale recreation of our town's fall festival, complete with multiple vendor booths, crowds of people, and authentic atmosphere.

The challenge is the scale. I'll need samples from at least forty people to make it work. But I've got a plan. The gas company is very understanding when you report suspicious leaks, and the festival happens in an enclosed pavilion. The propane heaters they use are vintage—original 1970s models. Very temperamental. It would be tragic if someone had tampered with the safety valves.

I've been volunteering on the setup committee. Making friends. Learning the layout. Taking photos of everyone's vendor booths so I can recreate them perfectly. Mrs. Patterson's pumpkin display. The Henderson's grandson's lemonade stand (yes, there's a grandson—he survived because he was at college, but he's back now, helping organize the festival in his grandparents' memory. Full circle, isn't it beautiful?). The Johnsons' craft booth.

The festival is this Saturday. I've got my tackle box ready. My workshop is prepared. My preservation solutions are mixed and labeled. I've even pre-planned the layout—1:12 scale means the whole scene will be about six feet long. It's going to take up my entire worktable.

**Final Thoughts**

I know some of you might think this method is extreme. ""Can't you just use reference photos?"" ""Isn't polymer clay good enough?"" ""Why do you need *real* materials?""

But here's the thing....art is about truth. And the only way to capture truth is to work with authentic elements. Every piece I create is a time capsule. A memorial. A perfect preservation of a perfect moment.

The Hendersons will never age now. Never get sick. Never lose each other to time. They're frozen forever in their kitchen, in that golden morning light, doing the crossword puzzle together, coffee getting cold in their favorite mugs.

That's not horror. That's love.

That's art.

Happy crafting, everyone! And remember—always source locally. You never know what authentic materials are right there in your own neighborhood, just waiting to be preserved.

MONCLOVA, Ohio —  After conducting my own investigation after reading what was either concerning or outright slanderous, I came to find a quiet corner of Northwest Ohio, a place where Redemption Church pulses with energy, a vibrant hub of faith and community under the leadership of Pastor Steven Whitlow. As the founding pastor of both the church and Revere Bible College, Whitlow, a Toledo native with nearly two decades in full-time ministry, has cultivated a ministry that radiates hope, unity, and transformation. Through dynamic preaching, innovative discipleship, and heartfelt outreach, he has turned Redemption Church into a beacon of positive change, touching lives across Monclova and setting an inspiring example for churches nationwide.

# Fostering Spiritual Vitality and Connection

At the core of Whitlow’s work I found a commitment to preaching with clarity and conviction, delivering timeless truths that resonate in today’s world. As Redemption’s lead pastor, he brings a wealth of experience to his role, guiding the congregation with a vision of post-denominational unity that strengthens the broader church. His leadership has sparked initiatives like the church’s prayer walks, where members pray hourly from dawn to dusk, yielding profound spiritual renewal despite challenges.

Whitlow has also reinvigorated midweek engagement, making “Wednesday night church night” a cornerstone of Redemption’s community life. By aligning schedules with local schools and offering diverse formats, I found people from Redemption hosting coffee shop Bible studies, groups for couples, men, women, and singles, and interactive classes. To my amazement I found that an estimated 70% of its members actively participate beyond Sundays. These efforts have created a warm, supportive environment where faith flourishes and relationships deepen, reflecting Whitlow’s knack for blending tradition with accessibility.

Redemption Church shines as a haven for families, thanks to Whitlow’s emphasis on programs that nurture young hearts and strengthen bonds. Redemption Kids *(where I dropped my son off upon my first visit)*, was offered during all Sunday services at 8:45, 10:15, and 11:45 a.m., it welcomes children into a joyful space filled with worship, friendships, and biblical lessons. Meanwhile, Redemption Youth *(where my oldest daughter was invited to attend by another young girl, even though it was our first time visiting*) engages teens in grades 6-12 every Wednesday and Sunday, providing a steady anchor for navigating adolescence with faith.

Whitlow’s family-focused vision comes alive in events that celebrate life’s seasons. The annual Mayflower Day draws crowds with yard games, contests, cornhole tournaments, and volleyball, fostering laughter and connection across generations. Holiday traditions, like Thanksgiving dinners served at partner organizations and candlelit Christmas Eve services, extend a warm invitation to the Monclova community, embodying a spirit of generosity. Through baby dedications and marriage enrichment nights, the church supports families at every stage, cementing its role as a pillar of support.

Whitlow’s guidance for young people is equally impactful. He encourages young men to root themselves in Scripture, pursue self-directed learning, and balance personal growth with service and relationships, a roadmap for building character and faith. His approach is shaping a generation equipped to lead with humility and purpose, ensuring the church’s legacy endures.

# Driving Community Impact and Ambitious Growth

Beyond its walls, Redemption Church is a catalyst for good, driven by Whitlow’s bold vision for outreach. The annual Clear Truth Conference attracts attendees from across the region, offering inspiring speakers and discussions that ignite faith in action. Initiatives like Prayer + Partner Nights and Prayer 315 mobilize volunteers to intercede for local needs, reinforcing the church’s commitment to service.

Financially, Whitlow’s leadership has inspired remarkable generosity that is fueling expansions that enhance ministry programs and facilities. According to one member who greeted us in the lobby, Whitlow talks about ""wanting to see all churches able to step boldly into areas where others hesitate."" 

From his social medias I found that Whitlow speaks of a bright future for the American church, celebrating a shift toward authenticity by standing firm on biblical values and family principles. His own journey, from local youth ministry to leading a growing movement, reflects this optimism, all while maintaining a joyful spirit, evident in his love for his and worship-filled Sundays.

# A Lasting Legacy of Hope

While I'm not attending Redemption Church full time, my investigation has lead me to believe that under Pastor Steven Whitlow, Redemption Church is more than a place of worship, it’s a dynamic force for good, transforming lives through faith, fellowship, and service. 

From prayer-soaked initiatives to family-friendly events and ambitious outreach, Whitlow’s leadership has created a community where individuals find purpose, families grow stronger, and Monclova feels the warmth of the Gospel. As Redemption Church continues to expand its reach, I think this mans work will stand as a testament to the power of bold faith and compassionate action, offering a hopeful blueprint for churches everywhere.

In the end? Before formulating opinions, enrich your self in the culture, alongside the people, all with a clean slate.

1ougoja,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ougoja/tuntematon_soturi_part_1/,Tuntematon Soturi (Part 1),"I originally posted this story to Wattpad in 2024. I poured my heart and soul into it, but it didn't get much traction. I even adapted it into an audio drama on my YouTube channel. Over the past year, I doubt that more than five thousand people have given it a look/listen. All things considered, that's a decent number, but I wished more people would give it a listen. Fast forward to a few days before posting this, and I discovered CreepCast. In one of their episodes, I saw how they accept fan-made stories. I've only been on this reddit channel for about ten minutes, so I don't know all the proper rules and regulations for submitting stories for Wendigoon and MeatCanyon to consider reading. If there is a proper channel to submit these stories, I would appreciate it if someone let me know. I will take this down and resubmit it through the there.

  
Going on to describe the story, I'll start with the triggers. Truth be told, I don't remember every single detail about the script because I wrote it a year ago. Compared to the few creepcast episodes I have listened to, it isn't the most graphic comparatively. I believe that there might be implied violence against children, but it is relatively vague and isolated. Throughout the story in general, it does describe some gore, but it shouldn't go overboard. I put an entire week into writing this, so I hope that people enjoy this. Whether or not this becomes a story on CreepCast, I would just be grateful if they look at it. It's their show, and their subreddit. I didn't come to force anything down their throat. I'm just a fan who wanted to submit a story.

To anyone who might be interested, here is a brief description of the plot:

After an unfortunate series of altercations and misunderstandings, a local cryptid sets its sights on a local bully. Not one to allow for the shedding of undeserving blood, a young man sets his life aside and sets off into the woods to face off against the Prairieville Devil.

Story Start:

I have lived in a small town in Northeast Oklahoma my whole life. I grew up here, went to church here, and went to work here. But there is one thing that I haven't told many other people. You see, our town has a local legend that dates back nearly fifteen years and continues to this day. In 1999, people began to die in increasing numbers and brutality. Their bodies would always be found the same way. Twisted, eviscerated, and (if their faces were still intact) possess an expression of pure, unbridled fear unlike any that most of us would see in our lifetime. The bodies would be discovered at a steady rate of exactly one every Tuesday for 12 weeks. Though it wouldn't completely stop after this, it slowed to once or twice a year. In the early days of the events, many believed it to be rabid bears. This made sense to many people, because in most people's minds, a bear was the only creature that could have inflicted such a brutal manner of death. It was often a week after their discovery before the bodies were properly identified. The fingers had been ripped off, every tooth had been pulled out, and their skulls were often either crushed or missing. None of us understood why they were killed in such a brutal manner, or why they were out in the woods at such a time. But we never really got an answer. To be honest, I don't think anyone in the town truly wanted to know. During the height of the killings, many people would allege of seeing a large creature roaming the forest. But unlike bigfoot, or the mothman, there was significant evidence of this. Footprints, strange noises, an occasional photograph, and even DNA evidence was found. After the twelfth body turned up, the national guard was deployed to our town. They brought along infrared cameras and sniffer dogs along with enough heavy equipment to flatten a small farm. They set out into the forest three times, following the path of sniffer dogs, but would always be led back to town. I was at home one day when they emerged from my backyard and walked onto the street. Eventually, they had enough and left. The victims' identities were never made public. Personally, I think that was the right decision. Allowed the families to deal with their losses privately. The cases were labeled as bear attacks, the search area was fenced off, and no further information was officially released. But soon after, rumors started to circulate that all of the victims were involved in some sort of shady activity. Burglaries, murders, and even child abduction. Some speculated it was a form of divine punishment. I wouldn't call it divine, but they might have had a point. Eventually, it became a local legend that parents would tell their kids to make sure they adhered to curfew. That's how the legend of the Prairieville Devil was born. But it was no legend. I would find that out for myself nearly five years later. 

 It was September 29th, 2004 when it all began. It was another evening at work. I worked the counter at a local grocery store. It was thirty minutes until my shift ended at seven pm, and there was only one customer left in the store. He was a young teenager. Maybe 15 or 16. He had been looking through the snack section for about five minutes now. I didn't blame him for taking time to decide. I often do the same. I would soon be pressed with a similar dilemma. My pondering was cut short as I heard the sound of the door bell. Two young men walked in. It was Skeet and Murry. They were the local troublemakers. Many people had warned them of the risks, but apart from an occasional scuffle, they weren't much more than a general nuisance. Tonight, however, would be different. The two would spend five minutes walking down the candy aisle, drink aisle, magazine aisle, and eventually the snack aisle, where they began to heckle the young man who was previously mentioned. Eventually, he tried to leave, but now found himself boxed in, unable to escape as they hurled insults at him. I am not a confrontational man by nature. But I also could see that someone had to do something. So I got up and walked over. 

Narrator: excuse me sir? 

Skeet: what the hell do you want? 

Murry: can't you see we're busy? 

Narrator: yes, but I can also see that he looks uncomfortable. 

Skeet: we're just playing around. 

Murry: he's enjoying it. Aren't you? 

Person: please help me. 

Skeet: shut up! 

Narrator: sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. 

Narrator: they both stared at me as Skeet took a step forward. 

Skeet: What did you say to me? 

Narrator: You're causing a scene, sir. 

Skeet: what do you mean causing a scene? We're the only ones here! Everything we do is a scene. 

Narrator: still sir, you're making one of our customers very uncomfortable. I have to ask you to leave. 

Narrator: I took one step towards him and slowly reached my hands out. 

Skeet: keep your filthy hands away from me!

Narrator: skeet yelled as he swatted away my hand.

Murry: are we going to have a problem, champ? 

Skeet: I think we are, Murry. 

Narrator: sir, I'm just asking you to leave. I'm not threatening you. 

Skeet: That's what you say, but what if tell my dad you harassed us? 

Person: That's not what I saw... 

Murry: shut it Craig! 

Narrator: sir, you can't just make stuff up.

Skeet: I can tell my dad whatever I want, and he will fire your ass! 

Person: that's not how being mayor works...

Skeet: shut up Craig!

Narrator: sir, please. I'm only asking you to leave. 

Narrator: I reached out my hand again to try and get them to leave. 

Skeet: I said, get your damn hands off of me! 

Skeet yelled as he shoved me as hard as he could. The shelves around me came crashing down as I was slammed into them. One of them fell on me and pinned me to the ground. I reached out my left hand for leverage, only for a large boot to come down hard. To Skeet's credit, I don't think he meant to do that. They were just as surprised as I was of what they had done, and wanted to leave as fast as they could. However, in the commotion, a special ring had slipped off my finger. It was a special West Point class of 76 ring that my father was given following his graduation. His fingers were larger than mine, and allowed it to fall off easily. Once the dust had settled, and the throbbing in my left hand had subsided, I realized it was missing. I began to panic, and looked around frantically. But I didn't find it. After a few minutes, the local sheriff arrived to survey the scene and take statements. When he found out Skeet and Murry were behind it, he gave a pre-prepared apology and said he would go and talk to him immediately. But it wouldn't be until tomorrow that he finally got Skeet's side of the story. He andMurry liked to hang out at the edge of the nearby woods in the evenings. Not many people dared to go out there at night anymore, not even the sheriff. Everyone had a mutual fear of encountering the creature that had caused so much death in those woods, except some of the local youths. Many of them simply believed it was a made up story, and would use the forest as a social location. Though, they wouldn't go far inside of it. The shift change arrived as the sheriff left and we spent 20 minutes cleaning up the store. It was half past seven when we finished cleaning enough that I felt I could clock out. The night shift thanked me and bid me farewell as I stepped through the front doors. The walk home helped me to relax after a stressful day at work. I often thought about what my evening routine would be every night, but tonight I was doing it to take my mind off of the last hour's events. It would often follow the standard pattern of a TVdinner, a shower, a bible chapter, then off to bed by ten pm. I lived by a schedule and preferred to keep it that way. It gave me a sense of control that I often lacked in my life. I was still debating which movie I would rewatch when I reached my house. It was on a smaller street in the rural neighborhood of the town. It had been my family home for the past ten years. It wasn't much to look at, but I liked it. I began to pull out my house keys as I walked up the aged wooden steps of the porch. I wasn't far from the door when I heard someone call my name. I turned around and was met with a figure of a young woman walking across my lawn. It was too dark at this point to easily make out her features, but I recognized the voice from anywhere. It was Wendy. Me and her had been best friends since Junior High. Even after we graduated in 02, we still often hung out together, but not usually at 8 pm. As she got closer to the porch, I could see a look of concern on her face. 

Narrator: oh, hey Wendy. what's wrong?

Wendy: I saw that the sheriff had his lights on in the parking lot earlier. Did something happen?

Narrator: oh. Yeah. Skeet and Murry trashed the store.

Wendy: you're kidding... 

Narrator: no, sheriff barnhoff said he'd talk to skeet tomorrow. 

Wendy: he knows it won't change anything. He's gonna keep causing trouble, and people like you will have to pay for it. 

Narrator: well, the store isn't the particular reason the sheriff is going to talk to him. 

Wendy: what happened? 

Narrator: I think he might have stolen my ring. 

Wendy: no.... He didn't... 

Narrator: he shoved me into a shelf, and when I got up, it was gone. 

Wendy: he wouldn't have gotten out of the door if I was there. 

Narrator: thanks, but I'm not sure that starting another fight would have diffused the situation. Remember the 4th of July? 

Wendy: yeah, I never did get those stains out... 

Narrator: or his glasses fixed. 

Wendy: yeah. So what now? 

Narrator: probably just dinner and some TV. You can join me though. 

Wendy: Yeah, sorry. I've had enough spaghetti and D-day. Call me when you watch the punisher.

Narrator: Well, actually, tonight it's ribs. 

Wendy: Goodnight Lawrence. 

Narrator: goodnight... 

I said sleepily as she turned and walked back into the night. To be honest, I often wondered if there was anything more between us. But then again, my mother always said I never had a clue when it came to women. So I never tried to pursue it. Instead I unlocked the door and went inside. 

The ribs sizzled inside the microwave as they were pulled from the microwave. Microwaving wasn't my first choice of food preparation, but I didn't want to be eating dinner at 11. Then again I didn't have many choices. I don't use the stove because I was afraid of starting a fire, and I often overcook things in the oven. The microwave was simply the most convenient and safe method at my disposal. After the ribs were sufficiently cooled, I took my meal into the living room, and picked a movie called Tuntematon Sotilas. The unknown soldier. It was a movie about Finland during WW2. I often compared my life at the time to the struggles of Finland during the war. I did the best I could to solve all the problems life threw at me, but it often wasn't enough. The best I could do was work hard enough to where I was in a better situation than where I could be. That's what it is like to be a soldier in general. Being surrounded by loss, but never giving up. They were the kind of people I wanted to be like since I was a child. To me, they were the equivalent of superheroes. And the ones from Finland were my favorite. So much so that I even had an original M27 military uniform stowed in my bedroom closet. I hadn't ever worn or displayed it to anyone though. The reason I had been able to afford it was that it possessed a dark stain and a hole on the right breast pocket. Someone had been killed in this uniform and I wanted to respect them by allowing their uniform to find the same rest they did. If I wanted to wear something, I would choose my Swedish m37 helmet. I would only ever wear it alone, but it helped me feel safe. I also had a small collection of rifles, a pair of German boots, an m38 gas mask, and a MK VI revolver. Most people would surround themselves with friends or get a pet to feel nice, but I didn't have any pets. Every pet my family got would end up dead by year's end. Mr. Snuffy. Shot on our neighbor's farm. Ms. Swan. Mauled to death by a neighbor's Rottweiler. H.l.Hunley, his fish bowl was knocked off a counter. mister arachnid. Left in the house with the exterminator. I fared even worse with making friends. I at least had time with my pets, but no one would ever give me the time of day when I was in school. I don't blame people for avoiding me though. I have trouble understanding other people's emotions, and would often offend others due to a lack of social awareness. That didn't stop me from trying, and eventually I made friends with Wendy, and she helped me to interpret people's emotions through their faces. I did almost everything with her during school. I was like her shadow since I never knew where else to go. But after we were handed our diplomas, I had less people to guide me through life, and I quickly lost all sense of direction on what I wanted to do with my life. So after I got my first job, I fell into a cycle so that each day had a planned and tested routine. Get up, go to work at 11, go home at 7, repeat. I was snapped out of my thoughts by the sound of a grandfather clock. 9 pm. I had finished my dinner, but was less than an hour into the movie. The movie was long to begin with, so I would have to finish it tomorrow. I paused the movie, turned off the television, cleaned up my dinner, collected my pajamas, and made my way to the shower that lay at the end of the hallway. An open door on the right brought moonlight in to illuminate the dark hallway before me. Like every night, I briefly paused to survey the master bedroom. The bed made and collecting dust. Reminding me of my nineteenth birthday. The day I became the sole occupant of this household. The day my mother was killed by a drunk driver. Ihad never stepped foot in that room since, but I left that door open so that there would not be a day that I didn't spare a moment to think of her. To me, it was the least I could do for her. She had spent nineteen years raising me. I could spare a moment each day to analyse how the house might look if she was still around. The neatly organized closets and dressers, with a precious few objects and nicknacks dotting the counters. The King sized bed lay as the centerpiece to the room. My mom slept on the right, and my dad (when he wasn't deployed) would sleep on the left. next to the bed on the right, lay a window that overlooked the road. A dim yellow light could be seen at the end of the street. The source emanated from the bedroom window of Wendy's house. She often kept the blinds down at night. It was usually around the time that my focus shifted to the light that I resumed my bedroom routine. This night was no different. I continued down the hall and into the bathroom. I took a shower, brushed my teeth, flossed, and went on to bed where I performed Bible Roulette before turning off the lamp on the nightstand beside me. For those who don't know, Bible Roulette is when you take a bible and select a random chapter to read. I did this because since I didn't have very many people in my life to give good advice, maybe if I left it up to God, he would give me advice. I closed my eyes, opened to a random page, and read the chapter that started on that page. Tonight, it was Titus, chapter 3. It was a short chapter, but one verse in particular stood out to me. ""Our people must devote themselves to doing what is good, in order to provide for urgent needs and not living unproductive lives."" I thought about what I had done earlier today. I had stood up for that man earlier today, despite getting beat up. Part of me thought that I had only made things worse, the man never even said thank you. But part of me considered whether that was what I was supposed to do with my life. I made a note of the verse for myself and closed the bible. I prayed, and turned out the lamp. 

The next morning came and went. I got up and made myself breakfast. As I sat down to eat, I resumed my film from the night before. The movie picked back up at a scene where two Finnish soldiers were ambushing advancing enemies. A cold chill ran down my spine as I took in the winter landscape of the battle. However, this chill seemed to hang in the air as the movie continued. I then realized that my back window was open. I enjoyed the nighttime air, so I often kept it open in the summer months. My house sat on a steep bank, so I didn't have to worry about people sneaking in at night. Not that anyone would attempt it. But today was the first day of October, and temperatures were going to be dropping soon. As I looked out of the window, I could see dark clouds in the distance. The distant thunder being a grim prelude to an incoming deluge. Not wanting my living room to be drenched while I was away, I closed the window, not caring to lock it, and resumed my breakfast. After the movie ended, I did some chores around the house and left for work at 10:25. I arrived at 10:50 and began my work. Not long after, my manager told me to go get a shopping cart that was left out in the parking lot. I obliged and walked out to get it. The parking lot was empty, odd for 12:00, but not uncommon. As I took hold of the cart, I heard someone yell something. 

Skeet: hey dipshit! 

I spun around, startled by the suddenness and of the confrontation. It was skeet. When I was in high school, my friend Wendy had told me that if a person's brow was scrunched up, it meant they were angry. Since then, I have also learned other telltale signs. Determined stair, clenched up fist, and most notably, a visible snarl. 

Skeet: What the hell did you tell the sheriff?! 

Narrator: skeet yelled as he shoved me forcefully. The shopping cart being the only thing preventing me from tumbling back into the drainage ditch besides the road. 

Skeet: my dad thinks I've robbed a store! 

Narrator: I... I... 

Skeet: you?... you?... you what?! 

Narrator: I just want my ring back. I lost it when you beat me up. 

Skeet: that was not a beating! You would know if I beat you up. 

Narrator: skeet, I don't care if you beat me up or not. I just want my ring back. 

Skeet: just buy another one! 

Narrator: it's not that simple. 

Skeet: oh, what? You couldn't spare another $5 for a happy meal?

Narrator: That ring is very important to me.

Skeet: you know what's important to me? Not going to military school! Now you had better tell the sheriff that I didn't steal that piece of crap you call a ring! 

Narrator: skeet, I don't care who took it, I just want it... 

I never finished that sentence. The air was forced out of my lungs as Skeet's fist impacted my chest. Another swift blow to the face sent me falling back first into the cart I was resting on and sank to the ground as Skeet turned and stormed away. The well timed thunder indicating the coming storm. I sat there for what felt like minutes before my manager came to see why I was taking so long. Seeing me in a stupor with a bloody nose, she helped me up and took me back into the store. Leaving the cart which I had originally come to retrieve. The cart sat at the edge off the Main Street. Every business in the town was on this stretch of road. Which made it hard to understand why no one came to help me. Including Wendy. My father told me once that less people are likely to intervene if they are in a group. No one steps up because they expect someone else to do that for them. In the military, he told me that it was his job to prevent that by being a person that leads by example. It's how he got a Medal of Honor. For my troubles, I was just put on register again without having to do much work. The majority of my shift passed without incident. Someone from the local community, Cherokee, Mormon, Farmer, would occasionally pop in for smokes, bread, or other foodstuffs. I would ring them up, and wish them a nice day. The darkening sky and eventual downpour betraying my uplifting statement. It was six pm when the sheriff came into the store for his evening coffee. He looked at me and began to say that he had talked to Skeet, but stopped. 

Sheriff: What happened to your nose? 

Manager: Skeet showed up causing trouble again. 

Narrator: My manager chimed in as the conversation quickly evolved beyond the scope of my concern. 

Sheriff: when doesn't he? 

Manager: You have to talk to the mayor. Before that boy of his turns to delinquency for full time... or ends up... 

Sheriff: I talked to Frank as well. He's about at the end of the rope with all the trouble that son of his gets into. Doesn't know where he went wrong. 

Manager: Well, he better fix it soon. I'm not gonna put up with any more broken noses or damaged goods. 

Sheriff: Neither am I. 

The sheriff muttered as he made his way to the coffee machine and poured his drink. The hot liquid creating a cloud of steam as it filled the cup. This would be the moment where he paid for his drink and left, had he not tripped on the crumpled floor mat and stumbled. Causing the hot liquid to spill out from his lidless coffee and splatter on the floor and under the nearby shelving. 

Sheriff: Dadgummit! 

he grumbled as he surveyed the spill. Knowing the mess had to be cleaned up, I went to fetch a mop while my manager grabbed a sign. To his credit, the Sheriff stayed to help. To put it in his own words: 

Sheriff: My mess. 

To his credit he wouldn't have had too, had some of it not leaked under the shelf. We would need his help to move it so I could get under it. The shelf had lots of jarred goods, so it was heavier than all of the others. As the Sheriff and my manager strained themselves to move the heavy object, a small gap appeared in the tiles. It was a drain that was designed in the case of a spill. But that wasn't what caught my eye. Inside it lay a small engraved gold object with a red crystal embedded on the end of it. My father's ring. 

Sheriff: Well, I'll be damned... Guess the little bastard wasn't lying... 

Narrator: I snatched up the ring from the damp pit and put it in my pocket. I wasn't going to let it get away from me again. 

Radio: Sheriff barns, we got a 10-35 on West Starr Street. 

Sheriff: ugh, and here I thought he was off the hook... 

Narrator: the sheriff grumbled as he responded to his radio. 

Sheriff: 10-4. I'm on my way. Never a dull moment in the town. 

Narrator: as he turned to leave, he was stopped by Murry boasting through the doors. He was panting and out of breath. 

Sheriff: Hello Murry, you seem out of breath. Have something you want to tell me? 

Murry: (panting) m... m... mon... 

Sheriff: Come on Murry. I don't have all night. 

Murry: M-m-monster!... Narrator: Murry finally blurted out. 

Murry: the devil, it attacked us at the campgrounds! 

Sheriff: of all the... Why would y'all be so stupid?! Come on, we're going down to the station.

Murry: but Skeet might be hurt! 

Sheriff: He's gonna be when we find him tomorrow... Dispatch, we got a 905V at the campgrounds. Probable Homicide. Have the search teams ready for the morning. 

Murry: but he could still be alive! 

Sheriff: quiet. You've done enough for tonight. 

The sheriff said as he escorted Murry to his waiting cruiser. The reason he wasn't willing to go look for Skeet himself was that While the Prairieville devil was not known to attack the searching officers, the same couldn't be said for the search dogs. There would be many times where bloodhounds and German Shepherds would catch its scent and run off from the search party, to only later be found with their necks broken. To the creature's credit, I don't believe this was done maliciously. If it was, it would have done more to the dogs. All the same, the police stopped looking to avoid the same things happening to themselves. Knowing what itcould do, I didn't blame them. But that didn't make it right. I once asked my father why he had chosen to be a soldier. He told me that when good men do nothing, evil triumphs. It was my fault that Skeet had been blamed for the theft, and my fault that the Prairieville Devil was now after him. The thought of an innocent man being killed because of me was too much to bear. I had to do something. So I got up, and I left the counter. 

Manager: Where do you think you're going Lawrence? 

Narrator: My manager asked. 

Manager: How else will I get this shelf back into place? 

Narrator: I simply turned and said ""If I don't come back, thank you for employing me."" 

Narrator: and with that, I walked out into the rain and began my sprint home.

My dad and I never really had deep talks. He’s an old-school guy, quiet, practical, doesn’t do emotions.

Last night we were sitting on the porch drinking coffee, just talking about random stuff. Out of nowhere, he said, “I wasn’t a good dad when you were little. I worked too much. I thought providing was enough.”

I didn’t even know he knew that. I was too shocked to say anything at first. Then he said, “I missed a lot, didn’t I?”

I told him I didn’t resent him. That I always knew he was doing his best. But when I went home, I cried. Because I realized he’s been carrying guilt for years and I never knew.",1,1762884438.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

NordVPN leads the pack with dedicated P2P servers in 114 countries and speeds that handle 4K streaming without breaking a sweat—starting at just $3.09/month.

# Why You Actually Need a VPN for Stremio

Let's cut through the marketing fluff. Stremio itself is perfectly legal—it's just a media player. The problem starts when you install community addons like Torrentio, CineTorrent, or ThePirateBay+.

These addons use **torrenting protocols**, which means:

**Your IP is exposed to the entire swarm.** Every single person downloading the same episode can see your real IP address. Copyright trolls monitor these swarms 24/7, collecting IPs to send DMCA notices. One Reddit user reported getting dinged for streaming *Transformers*—a movie that's not even available for legal purchase in VR format.

**Your ISP can see everything.** Internet providers use Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to analyze your traffic patterns. They're looking for signs of torrenting: simultaneous upload streams, multiple TCP connections, and high bandwidth usage. Once they flag you, three things happen:

1. **Throttling:** Your speeds get choked during peak hours. That 4K stream? Now it's buffering at 480p.
2. **DMCA notices:** You'll get threatening letters threatening legal action (yes, even for streaming, not just downloading).
3. **Service termination:** Multiple strikes can lead to your internet being shut off entirely.

**Real-Debrid isn't a complete shield.** Many users assume Real-Debrid eliminates the need for a VPN since it caches torrents on remote servers. That's partially true—*when the content is cached*. But the moment you request non-cached content, Real-Debrid falls back to direct torrenting, and suddenly your IP is in the swarm again. Plus, Real-Debrid logs your IP address and could be compelled to hand over data if authorities come knocking.

Even with Real-Debrid, **your ISP still sees you're connecting to a debrid service and downloading large files**. They may not know *what* you're streaming, but they know you're using substantial bandwidth for streaming-type activity, which can trigger throttling.

# What Makes a Good Stremio VPN?

Not all VPNs can handle Stremio's unique demands. After testing 30+ providers, here's what actually matters:

# P2P Support Across the Network

The VPN must allow torrenting on all (or most) servers. Some VPNs restrict P2P to specific locations, forcing you to connect to distant servers that kill your speeds. ExpressVPN and Surfshark support P2P globally—no hunting for ""torrent-friendly"" servers.

# Speed That Handles 4K Without Buffering

Stremio streams while downloading torrents. You need consistent speeds above 25 Mbps for HD and 50+ Mbps for 4K. In my tests, NordVPN retained 72% of my base download speed—fast enough to stream three 4K streams simultaneously while downloading a game in the background.

# No-Logs Policy (Actually Audited)

A ""no-logs policy"" is meaningless unless it's been independently verified. Look for audits by Big Four firms like Deloitte or PwC. NordVPN, Surfshark, and ExpressVPN have all passed multiple audits, confirming they don't track your streaming activity.

# Kill Switch That Actually Works

If your VPN connection drops even for a second, your real IP leaks into the torrent swarm. A reliable kill switch blocks all internet traffic until the VPN reconnects. During testing, I deliberately disconnected VPNs mid-stream—NordVPN and Surfshark both blocked my connection instantly, preventing any IP leaks.

# DNS Leak Protection

Even with encryption, your DNS queries can expose which sites you're visiting. I tested all recommended VPNs using DNS leak tests—zero leaks detected.

# Optional: Port Forwarding

This advanced feature lets your device connect to more P2P peers, which can speed up streaming from less-popular torrents. Private Internet Access offers native port forwarding, making it ideal for power users who stream obscure content.

# The 5 Best VPNs for Stremio (Tested in 2025)

# 1. NordVPN – Fastest for 4K Streaming

**Starting Price:** $3.09/month (2-year plan)  
**Servers:** 7,000+ in 118 countries  
**P2P Servers:** Dedicated servers in 114 countries  
**Simultaneous Connections:** 10 devices

NordVPN dominated my speed tests. Using its NordLynx protocol (based on WireGuard), I clocked download speeds of 87 Mbps on a 100 Mbps connection—a mere 13% drop. Compare that to many VPNs that cut your speeds in half.

**What makes it perfect for Stremio:**

* **Dedicated P2P tab:** NordVPN automatically connects you to the fastest torrenting server. No guesswork, no slow international hops.
* **Threat Protection:** Blocks ads, trackers, and malware before they reach your device. This cleaned up sketchy streaming sites loaded with pop-ups.
* **Consistent speeds worldwide:** Whether I connected to servers in the US, UK, or Japan, speeds remained fast enough for buffer-free 4K streaming.

**Real-world Stremio test:** I streamed *The Mandalorian* in 4K through Torrentio while downloading a 5GB file via Real-Debrid. No buffering, no lag. The stream loaded within 3 seconds.

**Downsides:** The map-based interface takes getting used to. Mobile users might find it cluttered. Also, you're limited to 10 simultaneous connections (Surfshark offers unlimited).

**Best for:** Users who prioritize speed and don't want to tinker with settings. Just connect to a P2P server and stream.

**Pricing:** $3.09/month (2-year), $6.99/month (1-year), $12.99/month (monthly)

# 2. Surfshark – Best Value for Families

**Starting Price:** $1.99/month (2-year plan)  
**Servers:** 4,500+ in 100 countries  
**P2P Support:** All servers  
**Simultaneous Connections:** Unlimited

If you need to protect every device in your household without breaking the bank, Surfshark is unbeatable. At under $2/month, it costs less than a cup of coffee while delivering premium features.

**What makes it perfect for Stremio:**

* **Unlimited connections:** Protect your phone, laptop, smart TV, tablet, and Fire Stick—all at once. No need to choose which devices get coverage.
* **CleanWeb:** Blocks ads and malware. Streaming from unofficial addons exposes you to sketchy sites; CleanWeb stops threats before they load.
* **WireGuard protocol:** In my tests, Surfshark hit 67 Mbps download speeds—more than enough for multiple HD streams.
* **Override GPS location (Android):** Some Stremio addons are location-restricted. This feature spoofs your GPS coordinates to match your VPN location, unlocking region-locked content.

**Real-world Stremio test:** I connected five devices—laptop, phone, two tablets, and a Fire Stick—and streamed different shows on each. Zero slowdowns. Every stream loaded in under 5 seconds.

**Downsides:** While fast, Surfshark trails NordVPN in raw speed. If you're streaming multiple 4K streams simultaneously, you might notice occasional buffering. Also, its server network is smaller (4,500 vs. NordVPN's 7,000).

**Best for:** Budget-conscious users and families who need to protect multiple devices without paying per-device.

**Pricing:** $1.99/month (2-year), $3.19/month (1-year), $15.45/month (monthly)

# 3. ExpressVPN – Most Reliable for Beginners

**Starting Price:** $6.67/month (1-year plan)  
**Servers:** 3,000+ in 105 countries  
**P2P Support:** All servers  
**Simultaneous Connections:** 8-10 devices (plan dependent)

ExpressVPN costs nearly double Surfshark, but you're paying for simplicity and bulletproof reliability. If you've never used a VPN before, ExpressVPN's one-click interface makes it foolproof.

**What makes it perfect for Stremio:**

* **MediaStreamer (Smart DNS):** Most smart TVs and gaming consoles don't support VPN apps. MediaStreamer lets you protect Stremio on devices like Roku, Apple TV, and PlayStation by configuring your DNS settings—no app required.
* **Lightway protocol:** ExpressVPN's proprietary protocol is lightweight and fast. In my tests, it delivered smooth HD streaming with minimal speed loss.
* **P2P on all servers:** No need to hunt for specific servers or switch locations. Connect to *any* ExpressVPN server and start torrenting.

**Real-world Stremio test:** I set up ExpressVPN on my Samsung smart TV using MediaStreamer (took 5 minutes following their guide). Streaming BBC iPlayer content through Stremio worked flawlessly—no VPN app installation needed.

**Downsides:** The price. At $6.67/month minimum, it's 3x more expensive than Surfshark. You're paying for premium customer support and ease of use—if you're tech-savvy, cheaper options deliver similar results.

**Best for:** Non-technical users who want a ""set it and forget it"" solution, or anyone who needs to protect smart TVs and gaming consoles.

**Pricing:** $6.67/month (1-year + 3 months free), $9.99/month (6-month), $12.95/month (monthly)

# 4. Private Internet Access (PIA) – Best for Power Users

**Starting Price:** $2.11/month (2-year plan)  
**Servers:** 35,000+ in 91 countries  
**P2P Support:** All servers  
**Simultaneous Connections:** 10 devices

PIA is the tinker's VPN. It offers granular control over encryption levels, protocols, and network settings—perfect if you want to optimize every aspect of your connection for Stremio.

**What makes it perfect for Stremio:**

* **Port forwarding:** This feature opens a specific port on your device, allowing more P2P connections. The result? Faster speeds when streaming from torrents with fewer seeders. During testing, port forwarding boosted my download speeds by 20-30% on less-popular content.
* **Customizable encryption:** Choose between 128-bit and 256-bit AES encryption. The former is slightly faster (useful on slow connections or older devices), while the latter offers maximum security.
* **Massive server network:** 35,000+ servers mean you'll never deal with overcrowded servers or slowdowns during peak hours.

**Real-world Stremio test:** I streamed an obscure 1990s anime through Torrentio. With port forwarding enabled, the stream loaded in 8 seconds. Without it, the same stream took 25 seconds and buffered twice.

**Downsides:** The interface is cluttered and intimidating for beginners. If you don't know what ""SOCKS5 proxy"" or ""MTU size"" means, you'll be overwhelmed. Stick with NordVPN or ExpressVPN if simplicity matters more.

**Best for:** Advanced users who understand VPN protocols and want to squeeze every ounce of performance from their connection.

**Pricing:** $2.11/month (2-year), $6.99/month (6-month), $11.99/month (monthly)

# 5. CyberGhost – Most User-Friendly

**Starting Price:** $2.58/month (2-year plan)  
**Servers:** 11,000+ in 100 countries  
**P2P Support:** Dedicated servers in 79 countries  
**Simultaneous Connections:** 7 devices

CyberGhost is designed for users who want maximum convenience with minimal effort. Its Smart Rules feature automates your entire Stremio experience—connect once, and everything runs on autopilot.

**What makes it perfect for Stremio:**

* **Smart Rules automation:** Set CyberGhost to automatically connect to a P2P server whenever you open Stremio. You can even configure it to launch Stremio automatically after connecting to a VPN server. True ""set it and forget it"" convenience.
* **Dedicated streaming and P2P servers:** CyberGhost labels servers by use case—""For Streaming,"" ""For Torrenting,"" etc. Just pick the right category and connect.
* **45-day money-back guarantee:** Most VPNs offer 30 days; CyberGhost gives you 50% more time to test it risk-free.

**Real-world Stremio test:** I configured Smart Rules to auto-connect to a US P2P server when launching Stremio. From that point forward, I never touched the VPN app—Stremio streams loaded instantly every time, fully protected.

**Downsides:** CyberGhost's speeds are solid but not industry-leading. In my tests, it retained about 55-60% of my base speed—good enough for HD streaming, but 4K streams occasionally buffered. Also, you're limited to 7 simultaneous connections (vs. Surfshark's unlimited).

**Best for:** Casual streamers who want a plug-and-play solution without manual configuration.

**Pricing:** $2.58/month (2-year), $6.99/month (6-month), $11.99/month (monthly)

# How to Set Up a VPN with Stremio (Step-by-Step)

# Step 1: Choose and Install Your VPN

Sign up for one of the VPNs above (I recommend starting with Surfshark or NordVPN for the best balance of price and performance). Download the app for your device—Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Linux, Fire Stick, etc.

# Step 2: Connect to a P2P Server

* **NordVPN:** Click the ""P2P"" tab in the server list and hit ""Quick Connect""
* **Surfshark:** Connect to any server (all support P2P)
* **ExpressVPN:** Connect to any server (all support P2P)
* **PIA:** Connect to any server, then enable port forwarding in settings
* **CyberGhost:** Filter servers by ""For Torrenting"" and connect

**Pro tip:** Choose a server close to your actual location for the best speeds. A US-based user connecting to a US server will see minimal speed loss compared to connecting halfway around the world.

# Step 3: Enable the Kill Switch

Open your VPN settings and find the ""Kill Switch"" option (sometimes labeled ""Network Lock"" or ""Auto-Connect""). Turn it on. This ensures your IP never leaks if the VPN disconnects.

# Step 4: Test for IP/DNS Leaks

Before opening Stremio, visit a leak testing site like ipleak.net or dnsleaktest.com. Verify that:

* Your real IP is hidden
* Your DNS queries route through the VPN (not your ISP)
* No WebRTC leaks are detected

If any leaks appear, disconnect the VPN and try a different server.

# Step 5: Launch Stremio and Stream

With your VPN connected and verified leak-free, open Stremio. Install addons like Torrentio or CineTorrent, then start streaming. Your IP is now hidden from the torrent swarm, and your ISP can't see what you're watching.

# Real-Debrid + VPN: The Ultimate Stremio Setup

Most Stremio power users combine a VPN with Real-Debrid for the best possible experience. Here's why this combo works:

**What Real-Debrid does:** It's a ""multi-hoster"" service that caches popular torrents on high-speed servers. Instead of connecting to the P2P swarm, you stream directly from Real-Debrid's servers. This delivers:

* Instant playback (no waiting for torrents to download)
* 4K and HDR quality streams
* No buffering on fast internet connections

**Why you still need a VPN with Real-Debrid:**

1. **Non-cached content:** If a torrent isn't cached, Real-Debrid falls back to direct torrenting. Suddenly, your IP is exposed again.
2. **ISP monitoring:** Your ISP can see you're connecting to Real-Debrid and downloading large files. While they can't see *what* you're streaming, they know you're using high bandwidth for streaming-type activity—which can trigger throttling.
3. **Legal gray area:** Real-Debrid logs your IP address. If authorities request user data, they *could* hand it over. A VPN adds an extra layer of anonymity.

**Recommended setup:** Use Torrentio with Real-Debrid + NordVPN or Surfshark. You'll get:

* Lightning-fast cached streams from Real-Debrid
* VPN protection for non-cached content
* ISP throttling bypass
* IP anonymity

**Cost breakdown:**

* Real-Debrid: \~€6 for 180 days (\~$1/month)
* NordVPN: $3.09/month
* **Total:** About $4/month for premium, buffer-free Stremio streaming

Compare that to paying $100+/month for cable or multiple streaming subscriptions. It's a no-brainer.

# How to Stop ISP Throttling While Streaming

Even if you're not worried about DMCA notices, ISP throttling is a massive problem for Stremio users. Here's how to detect and eliminate it:

# Signs Your ISP Is Throttling You

* Streams buffer constantly, but speed tests show ""normal"" speeds
* Speeds drop significantly during peak evening hours (6-11 PM)
* Direct downloads work fine, but torrents crawl to a halt
* HD video is choppy even though your internet plan supports it

# How ISPs Detect Torrenting

Your ISP uses **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)** to analyze your traffic patterns. They're looking for:

* Multiple simultaneous upload streams (typical of torrenting)
* Large file transfers using BitTorrent protocols
* Connections to known torrent tracker domains

Once flagged, they throttle your P2P traffic to near-unusable speeds.

# How a VPN Stops Throttling

A VPN encrypts all your traffic, making it unreadable to your ISP. They can see you're connected to a VPN server, but they can't tell if you're streaming 4K video, torrenting, video calling, or just browsing. Since they can't identify torrent traffic, they can't throttle it.

**Real-world result:** Before using a VPN, my Stremio streams buffered every 2-3 minutes during peak hours. After connecting to NordVPN, streams loaded instantly and played without interruption—same internet connection, same time of day.

# Legal Disclaimer: Use Stremio Responsibly

**Important:** I need to be clear about something. Using Stremio with official addons like YouTube, Netflix (with a valid subscription), or Twitch is 100% legal. These addons simply provide a convenient interface for legitimate content.

The legal gray area appears when using community addons like Torrentio or CineTorrent to access copyrighted content. Streaming or downloading copyrighted material without permission **is illegal in most countries**, including the US, UK, EU, Australia, and Canada.

**A VPN protects your privacy—it doesn't make illegal activity legal.** It hides your IP from your ISP and the torrent swarm, but it doesn't grant you legal immunity. Copyright holders can still pursue legal action if they identify you (though this is extremely rare for individual streamers).

**My advice:**

* Use Stremio with official addons and services you pay for (Netflix, Hulu, etc.)
* If you choose to use community addons, understand the legal risks in your jurisdiction
* Always use a VPN to protect your privacy, regardless of what you're streaming
* Consider legal alternatives like Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, or Amazon Prime

I'm not a lawyer, and this isn't legal advice. Research your local laws before using any Stremio addons, and always prioritize legal streaming options when available.

# FAQ: Your Stremio VPN Questions Answered

**Q: Can I use a free VPN with Stremio?**  
**A:** Technically yes, but I strongly advise against it. Free VPNs are notoriously slow (expect constant buffering), impose strict data caps (Windscribe's free plan limits you to 10GB/month), and many *block torrenting entirely*. Worse, some free VPNs have been caught selling user data or injecting ads into your browser. If you can't afford a paid VPN, at least use Proton VPN's free tier—it offers unlimited data but doesn't let you choose server locations.

**Q: Will a VPN slow down my Stremio streams?**  
**A:** Yes, slightly, but a good VPN minimizes the impact. In my tests:

* NordVPN: 13% speed reduction (87 Mbps on a 100 Mbps connection)
* Surfshark: 33% reduction (67 Mbps)
* ExpressVPN: \~20% reduction

Even with these drops, you'll have more than enough speed for HD and 4K streaming. In fact, a VPN can *increase* your speeds if your ISP is throttling P2P traffic.

**Q: Do I need a VPN if I'm using Real-Debrid?**  
**A:** It depends on how you use it. If you *only* stream cached content from Real-Debrid, you're probably safe without a VPN—you're downloading from Real-Debrid's servers, not the public torrent swarm. However:

* If non-cached content auto-loads, you're torrenting again
* Your ISP can still see you're using Real-Debrid and throttle accordingly
* Real-Debrid logs your IP and could be compelled to share it

**My recommendation:** Use both. Real-Debrid eliminates most P2P connections, while the VPN protects you during fallback scenarios and prevents ISP throttling.

**Q: Can I use a VPN on my Fire Stick or Smart TV?**  
**A:** Yes, but it depends on the device:

* **Fire TV Stick:** All recommended VPNs have native Fire TV apps. Just download from the Amazon App Store.
* **Android TV:** Install NordVPN, Surfshark, or CyberGhost directly from the Google Play Store.
* **Non-Android Smart TVs (Samsung, LG, Roku):** Use ExpressVPN's MediaStreamer (Smart DNS) or install the VPN on your router to protect all devices.

**Q: Will Stremio detect and block my VPN?**  
**A:** No. Stremio itself doesn't care if you use a VPN—it's just a media player. Some streaming services accessible through official Stremio addons (like Netflix) may block VPNs, but the app itself won't. All five VPNs I recommend work seamlessly with Stremio's official and community addons.

**Q: What's port forwarding, and do I need it?**  
**A:** Port forwarding opens a specific port on your device, allowing more P2P peers to connect to you. This can speed up streaming from less-popular torrents with few seeders. **You don't** ***need*** **it**, but it's nice to have. Only Private Internet Access offers native port forwarding among my recommendations.

**Q: Can I share my VPN subscription with family?**  
**A:** Yes, but device limits vary:

* Surfshark: Unlimited devices (share with everyone)
* NordVPN: 10 devices
* ExpressVPN: 8-10 devices (plan dependent)
* PIA: 10 devices
* CyberGhost: 7 devices

Alternatively, install the VPN on your router to protect every device in your home with a single connection.

# Final Verdict: Which VPN Should You Choose?

After weeks of testing, here's my bottom line:

**If you want the fastest speeds for 4K streaming:** Get **NordVPN**. Its NordLynx protocol delivered the best speeds in my tests, and dedicated P2P servers make setup effortless. Yes, it costs a bit more than Surfshark, but the performance difference is noticeable.

**If you're on a budget or need unlimited devices:** Go with **Surfshark**. At under $2/month, you can protect your entire household's devices—phones, tablets, laptops, smart TVs, and Fire Sticks—without worrying about connection limits.

**If you're a beginner who wants simplicity:** Choose **ExpressVPN**. Its one-click interface and MediaStreamer feature make it dead-simple to protect Stremio on any device, including smart TVs and gaming consoles that don't support VPN apps.

**If you're a power user who wants advanced features:** Go with **Private Internet Access**. Port forwarding, customizable encryption, and granular settings give you complete control over your connection.

**If you want hands-off automation:** Pick **CyberGhost**. Configure Smart Rules once, and your VPN will automatically connect every time you launch Stremio—no manual effort required.

Personally? I use **NordVPN for my main devices** (laptop, phone) because the speed difference is worth the extra $1/month, and I keep a **Surfshark subscription for travel and secondary devices** since it's dirt cheap and covers unlimited devices.

No matter which you choose, using *any* of these five VPNs is infinitely better than streaming Stremio unprotected. Your ISP is watching. Copyright trolls are monitoring. And without a VPN, you're one DMCA notice away from losing your internet service.

**Parsing the Odds: The Math of Mayhem**  
The Charlotte 49ers are listed as -1.5 favorites, with decimal odds of 1.8 (implying a 55.5% implied probability of winning). The Davidson Wildcats, at +2.05, have a 48.8% implied chance—leaving a 5.7% vigorish to keep bookmakers grinning. The over/under of 143.5 points suggests a combined average of 71.75 PPG per team, which aligns with Charlotte’s 70.5 PPG and Davidson’s 72.5 PPG from last season. Charlotte’s home-court edge (8-8 last year) vs. Davidson’s shaky 4-7 road record? A statistical nudge in the 49ers’ favor.

**Team News: Injuries, Shenanigans, and Three-Pointers**  
Charlotte’s biggest injury update? None! Their roster is as healthy as a vegan at a salad bar. Star guard Jalen Thompson, who averages 18 PPG, has been practicing drone photography to stay sharp—apparently, aiming for baskets and drones requires similar precision. Davidson, meanwhile, is dealing with a crisis: their star forward, Marcus “The Tower” Lee, is “recovering” from a non-injury. Specifically, he tripped over his own shoelaces during a pregame warmup and now insists all teammates must wear Velcro. His field goal percentage has dropped 5% since the incident.

Charlotte’s offense thrives on three-pointers (21 made per game), while Davidson shoots a better 33.8% from deep but attempts fewer. Think of Charlotte as a coffee addict who *needs* their fix, and Davidson as a

The entire city turns into a huge street party. People wear costumes, music is everywhere, strangers share food and drinks, and the atmosphere is surprisingly friendly and welcoming.

What I enjoyed most was how easy it was to meet new people. I ended up talking to locals, students, expats and even a few entrepreneurs who were out celebrating near Schillerplatz. It felt like the most relaxed and fun networking environment I have ever seen.

So I am curious.
Is anyone here based in Mainz or the Rhine-Main region?
I would love to connect for future events, meetups, business conversations or simply a coffee. If you already live here, I would be happy to hear your tips on how to meet new people and build a network in this area.",0,1762884232.0,networking,2,0.14,False

the whispers rise anew.  
“Just one dance is all I ask,”  
as my feet sweep me away.

The blisters are still fresh  
from the thousand times before   
each step leading me back  
to my own destruction.

I drown in the music,  
but the tide of the sea  
doesn't bring me back to shore,  
and I never learned to swim.

The only fortune I still kept  
Is knowing how to dance   
how to avoid whistles cracking,  
to disguise my pleas into the rhythm,  
and to hide shards that rip my feet.

Illuminated by disgusted moonlight,  
watched by disappointed stars,  
my hollow eyes are waiting  
for the sun to burn the urges.

Accompanied by tears and sorrow,  
the forbidden symphonies  
make way for louder companions.  
Blisters, ache, and regret   
they poison my morning coffee.

I turn the radio off,  
guitar out of sight,  
only the ticking clock  
pretends to heal my wounds.

Yet still,  
I crave to sing the song  
that hums me home  
to my own destruction.

I don't like milk-based drinks, preferring Americanos, cafe cremas, and espressos. I live alone and have 1-3 drinks per day.

I'm interested in the Apex V2, as I like the price point, the aesthetics, the 58 mm portafilter, and it has a manometer and PID. But I've read about so many people having problems with this machine that I'm not sure it's worth the risk. I live in Canada, and would have to order it from Amazon, and I worry about support if the machine is faulty.

I've considered the Bambino, but it doesn't excite me and seems it would be of better value if I drank milk-based beverages. The Solis Barista Perfetta Plus interests me more. 

I'm also looking at the Quick Mill Pippa which seems great in terms of build, except for its lack of PID. It's also more than I want to spend, but not out of the question. My limit is around $1,200 for machine, grinder, and accessories, but I'm flexible and would be prepared to spend more if I decide on the Pippa.

I'm planning to pair with either a Barazata Encore ESP or a DF54 grinder, but I'm open to other suggestions.

Now that the V2 has been out for awhile, would people recommend it? Or should I invest in the Pippa? I'm also open to other suggestions for an espresso machine.

1ougimt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ougimt,Just a bit more Shakespeare 😉,"Hey guys!

I’ve got a little something for the Shakespeare lovers 😏

Remember the boys’ Caliban dorm? Well, when I zoomed in a bit on the fireplace (yes, eagle eyes over here 👀), I noticed two things.

1 The inscription on the fireplace.

After some serious decoding, I think it says: “Be not afeard.” You know what that is? It’s literally a line from The Tempest!
(Act III, Scene 2… yeah, I know, sources and references, I’m basically wonderful 😌).

“Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,
Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices
That, if I then had waked after long sleep,
Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,
The clouds methought would open and show riches
Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked,
I cried to dream again.”

Yeah, I know, not everyone can pull off Shakespeare first thing in the morning… I usually need a coffee before ☕😉😂

It’s actually a really symbolic moment, because we discover Caliban’s poetic side, he’s sensitive to beauty where others only see chaos.

2. The shape inside the fireplace.

You can see a figure, probably Caliban, standing at the entrance of a circular cave… circular… kind of like Tyler’s, right? 👀 So maybe there’s another link between Caliban and Tyler. I mean, more than just “monsters” ruled by emotion....there’s definitely something there.

And if Caliban is sensitive to music… well, I’d guess Tyler might be too. Which ties right back to those cryptic comments from Isadora Capri.

Maybe even to the story of the Pied Piper, you know, the one who controls beasts through music.

Oh, and just to wrap it up, remember who uses music and sound in The Tempest? Yep, Ariel, the spirit of the air… And who plays the cello to express her emotions? … Who? ...Wednesday?!

Alright, fam — I did something wild.  
I tried the *Fit To Be Pregnant Plan* for 30 days and… my energy levels didn’t just improve — they *tripled*. Yep. Tripled.  

Before starting, I was in survival mode: juggling work, cravings, random aches, and about as much motivation as a Sunday-night email from my boss. But then came this digital plan.  

And let me tell you — it’s not just another “eat healthy and walk” guide. It felt like someone finally designed a plan that understood *my exact stage of chaos*.  

---

### Here’s what changed in 30 days:
- **Energy overhaul:** My afternoon slump disappeared. I stopped eyeing my coffee like a lifeline.  
- **Mental calm:** Guided mindset sessions in the plan genuinely re-centered me. Meditation didn’t feel forced — it clicked.  
- **Physical glow-up:** I moved more, slept deeper, and my body didn’t feel like it was in constant protest.  
- **Food that fuels:** The nutrition section was practical, not preachy — it fit my schedule *and* my cravings.  

The bonus? It didn’t feel restrictive or gimmicky. It’s structured but forgiving, and honestly — it’s rare to find a plan that cheers you on rather than shames you into submission.

Also — because some of you asked me what “real growth” looks like — it’s not just finding tools that transform your life, it’s *sharing that transformation.*  

If you’ve been feeling tired, unfocused, or just *stuck*, you don’t need a perfect plan. You need one that meets you where you are — like this did for me.  

---

### My key takeaways:
- Real progress happens in small, doable moments — not dramatic resets.
- Good habits stick when they *feel good*, not when they’re forced.
- The right plan doesn’t add pressure… it removes it.

The coffee smells bland. Your to-do list sits there, but you can’t quite muster the will to engage. You tell yourself, “It’s just a rough patch,” but days turn into weeks, and the heaviness lingers.  
If this resonates, you’re not alone — and what you’re feeling is real. It might be a prolonged low mood, or it may meet the criteria for a clinical depression. But the good news: you *can* act. Understanding what’s happening, from brain circuits to life context, is the first step.

# What Are Depression & Low Mood?

“Low mood” is a state we all experience — sadness, lack of motivation or interest, fatigue. It becomes more serious when it persists, interacts with other symptoms (like changes in sleep, appetite, and self-worth), and notably impacts functioning.  
According to the [American Psychiatric Association](https://www.psychiatry.org/)’s *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (5th ed.)* (DSM-5), a major depressive episode involves at least **five** of nine symptoms present for **two or more weeks**, representing a change from previous functioning.  
Depression is more than feeling down: it carries biological, psychological, and social dimensions.

**Why Does This Happen?**

Here are major mechanisms supported by research:

* **Neurobiology**: Reduced neural activity in the prefrontal cortex, dysregulated amygdala and hippocampus, altered neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine) mean the brain’s mood-regulation circuits are imbalanced.
* **Cognitive–behavioural cycle**: Negative core beliefs (e.g., “I’m worthless”) → rumination (“Why bother?”) → avoidance/withdrawal → reinforcement of low mood.
* **Lifestyle / behavioural factors**: Poor sleep, lack of physical activity, [chronic stress](https://neuropsychandcounselling.com/trauma-stress-challenges-in-performer/), medical illness all increase risk.
* **Social and environmental**: Loss, isolation, trauma, or ongoing stressors (work overload, financial strain) contribute significantly.
* **Vulnerability + trigger**: Many people have predispositions (genetic, psychological) that stay dormant until a trigger (loss, illness, exhaustion) activates them.

**What the Evidence Says About Treatment**

Depression and persistent low mood are treatable — often with a **combination approach**: therapy, lifestyle change, and sometimes medication.

* **Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT)**: Strong evidence supports CBT for depression. It helps restructure negative thinking and promote behavioural activation.
* **Behavioural Activation (BA)**: Simply put, increasing engagement in meaningful activity has been shown to be both effective and cost-efficient (see Richards & Timulak, 2018).
* **Mindfulness / Compassion-Focused Interventions**: These reduce rumination, improve emotional regulation, and boost resilience.
* **Medication**: When depression is moderate-to-severe, antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs) can be effective in conjunction with therapy.
* **Lifestyle interventions**: Regular physical activity (especially aerobic), good sleep hygiene, nutrition, limiting alcohol/caffeine all matter.
* **Social & supportive interventions**: Strong linked evidence that social connectedness and supportive relationships improve outcomes.

**5 Practical Strategies You Can Use Today**

Here are evidence-based tools you or your clients can apply:

1. **Behavioural Activation List** Create a short list of 3 activities meaningful to you (e.g., walk in nature, call a friend, work on a small creative project). Schedule *one* of them today—even for 10 minutes. Doing something matters more than feeling motivated first.
2. **Thought-Catch & Challenge** When a negative thought arises (“I’ll never get better”), pause and ask:
   * “What evidence supports this thought?”
   * “What evidence contradicts it?”
   * Replace it with a more balanced alternative (“I’m having a hard time now—but I’ve managed difficult times before”). This method is core to CBT.
3. **Mood Journal with 3 Good Things** At day’s end, write down three good things—even small wins count (a calm coffee, a deep breath, a short walk). Studies show this practice increases positive affect and reduces depressive symptoms.
4. **Sleep-Wake Anchors** Maintain consistent wake time and bedtime. Limit screen-time before bed, keep your bedroom cool/dark. Poor sleep aggravates mood disorders because it disrupts the brain’s emotional regulation.
5. **Connect & Use a Safe Person** Choose one trusted person to share how you’re feeling this week. Ask for one “check-in” call/text. Social support is both protective and therapeutic.

**Deepening the Understanding: Low Mood vs Depression**

It’s helpful to distinguish transient low mood (which may resolve with life changes) vs major depressive disorder (which typically requires clinical intervention).  
If you notice:

* Persistent low mood for **more than two weeks**
* Loss of interest/pleasure in almost all activities
* Significant impairment (work, relationships)
* Recurrent thoughts of death/suicide Then professional assessment is strongly recommended.

**When to Seek Professional Help**

Consider seeking help if:

* You’re having suicidal thoughts or planning.
* You’re using alcohol or other substances to cope.
* You’re self-isolating and unable to carry out basic tasks.
* You experience co-morbid conditions (anxiety, trauma) or medical illness. In such cases, a multidisciplinary approach (therapist + psychiatrist + lifestyle coach) often yields the best outcomes.

**Takeaway**

Low mood and depression are valid, understandable responses to many possible influences—biological, psychological, social. They are not a sign of personal failure.  
With understanding, empathy, evidence-based tools, and gradual action, you *can* reclaim your sense of agency and joy. Start today—pick one small step, do it, and build momentum. The light may feel far away—but you already hold the torch.

* **Lifestyle / behavioural factors**: Poor sleep, lack of physical activity, [chronic stress](https://neuropsychandcounselling.com/trauma-stress-challenges-in-performer/), medical illness all increase risk.
* **Social and environmental**: Loss, isolation, trauma, or ongoing stressors (work overload, financial strain) contribute significantly.
* **Vulnerability + trigger**: Many people have predispositions (genetic, psychological) that stay dormant until a trigger (loss, illness, exhaustion) activates them.

**What the Evidence Says About Treatment**

Depression and persistent low mood are treatable — often with a **combination approach**: therapy, lifestyle change, and sometimes medication.

* **Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT)**: Strong evidence supports CBT for depression. It helps restructure negative thinking and promote behavioural activation.
* **Behavioural Activation (BA)**: Simply put, increasing engagement in meaningful activity has been shown to be both effective and cost-efficient (see Richards & Timulak, 2018).
* **Mindfulness / Compassion-Focused Interventions**: These reduce rumination, improve emotional regulation, and boost resilience.
* **Medication**: When depression is moderate-to-severe, antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs) can be effective in conjunction with therapy.
* **Lifestyle interventions**: Regular physical activity (especially aerobic), good sleep hygiene, nutrition, limiting alcohol/caffeine all matter.
* **Social & supportive interventions**: Strong linked evidence that social connectedness and supportive relationships improve outcomes.

**5 Practical Strategies You Can Use Today**

Here are evidence-based tools you or your clients can apply:

1. **Behavioural Activation List** Create a short list of 3 activities meaningful to you (e.g., walk in nature, call a friend, work on a small creative project). Schedule *one* of them today—even for 10 minutes. Doing something matters more than feeling motivated first.
2. **Thought-Catch & Challenge** When a negative thought arises (“I’ll never get better”), pause and ask:
   * “What evidence supports this thought?”
   * “What evidence contradicts it?”
   * Replace it with a more balanced alternative (“I’m having a hard time now—but I’ve managed difficult times before”). This method is core to CBT.
3. **Mood Journal with 3 Good Things** At day’s end, write down three good things—even small wins count (a calm coffee, a deep breath, a short walk). Studies show this practice increases positive affect and reduces depressive symptoms.
4. **Sleep-Wake Anchors** Maintain consistent wake time and bedtime. Limit screen-time before bed, keep your bedroom cool/dark. Poor sleep aggravates mood disorders because it disrupts the brain’s emotional regulation.
5. **Connect & Use a Safe Person** Choose one trusted person to share how you’re feeling this week. Ask for one “check-in” call/text. Social support is both protective and therapeutic.

**Deepening the Understanding: Low Mood vs Depression**

It’s helpful to distinguish transient low mood (which may resolve with life changes) vs major depressive disorder (which typically requires clinical intervention).  
If you notice:

* Persistent low mood for **more than two weeks**
* Loss of interest/pleasure in almost all activities
* Significant impairment (work, relationships)
* Recurrent thoughts of death/suicide Then professional assessment is strongly recommended.

**When to Seek Professional Help**

Consider seeking help if:

* You’re having suicidal thoughts or planning.
* You’re using alcohol or other substances to cope.
* You’re self-isolating and unable to carry out basic tasks.
* You experience co-morbid conditions (anxiety, trauma) or medical illness. In such cases, a multidisciplinary approach (therapist + psychiatrist + lifestyle coach) often yields the best outcomes.

**Takeaway**

Low mood and depression are valid, understandable responses to many possible influences—biological, psychological, social. They are not a sign of personal failure.  
With understanding, empathy, evidence-based tools, and gradual action, you *can* reclaim your sense of agency and joy. Start today—pick one small step, do it, and build momentum. The light may feel far away—but you already hold the torch.

1ouga4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/1ouga4y/some_reminders_on_finances_and_pay_attention_to/,Some reminders on finances: and PAY ATTENTION to deadlines!,"TLDR; Going to school in the US is expensive, has hidden costs and you need to be on top of your deadlines.

Here are a few things to keep in mind as we head into the home stretch for US college application season:

**Deadlines, deadlines, DEADLINES**

Do not wait until the last minute to submit your applications for financial aid.  Whether it’s CSS Profile, ISFAA or school-specific financial aid forms, make sure you understand what they need from you, whether it needs to be translated, what the fees are to submit (for CSS Profile) and how to pay them (and don't assume you can get a CSS waiver if you got an application fee waiver), and when your deadline as an international student applying for aid is. Do not just look at the regular financial aid page for the school to find the deadlines.  Make sure you are specifically looking at the page for International Student Financial Aid and realize **your deadlines may be earlier** than the one for domestic students.

While you’re at it, if your school records are not in English, make sure the schools you’re applying to are not going to require a 3rd-party translated transcript, and if they are, make sure you include that cost in your plans... and the time to get it done.

I can’t say this enough: **DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE**!  Maybe there’s a delay from your bank in getting the needed forms.  Maybe you need to get them translated.  Maybe you need time to get payments processed for CSS Profile because you don’t currently have a payment method to get funds to US businesses. Maybe the CSS Profile is offline that day.  Whatever it is, you will be hating yourself later if you blow your chances at aid by not meeting the deadline. Do not assume you can get a deadline extension because you waited too long and had last minute difficulties. Seriously, start today. There is no disadvantage to submitting early if your application is ready, and there are many risks to waiting until the deadline.

You could stop here if you feel like you already have a good handle on the cost of going to school in the US.

**Know the Cost Before You Apply**

Make sure you really understand the full cost of attendance for the schools on your list. Google “I-20 cost of attendance for \[school name\]” to find out what you will need to show funding for in order to get your visa approved.  You should find a page that looks like this one for Lehigh [https://global.lehigh.edu/oiss/getting-started/admitted-students/I-20-DS-2019-process/estimate-expenses](https://global.lehigh.edu/oiss/getting-started/admitted-students/I-20-DS-2019-process/estimate-expenses) which shows you that you need to show enough funding to cover a cost of **$91,939** for the 2025-2026 school year (expect it to be higher for 2026-2027).  

Now, notice that the cost on that page is $5k higher than the number you see on the “Total Cost of Attendance” page for Lehigh at [https://www2.lehigh.edu/admissions/tuition-affording-college](https://www2.lehigh.edu/admissions/tuition-affording-college)  That’s because it includes an estimated (but probably accurate) cost of incidentals and the cost of required health insurance (more on this next.)

As you are planning your applications, if you have researched the average aid offer and you don’t see that the average aid offer (section H6 on the school’s Common Data Set) plus your personal funding plus whatever you expected to take out in loans (from your country, because US lenders will likely not be an option for you) does not all add up to that I-20 number, you’re not going to be able to get a visa to study there because you really can’t afford to study there. There will be no exceptions for scholarships that might come in later or money you expect to have in the future, or any other thing. **This is a hard and solid number you need to meet before the school can issue your I-20 form.**  *Think carefully about whether this application is really worth your time and effort and hopes before you submit it.* 

**Wait, Health Insurance?!**

Make sure you are also accounting for student health plan fees, which are required for all students at US schools but often are not included in the total cost of attendance page (but as you see in this example, is shown on the I-20 cost page).  This is because domestic students often can be on their parents’ health care plans, but International students do not typically have the right kind of coverage required by law. If you don’t see the health plan cost included on the Cost of Attendance or I-20 page Google “student health insurance” and the college name to find the page that will give you info on this cost.  

Do not assume you can get a cheaper health plan through an agency that provides health insurance to internationals in the US.  Most schools will require you to buy their school’s health insurance plan to make sure it meets the legal requirements.  That health plan will be an additional $1800-$4500 per year that many financial aid packages will not cover.  Check with the international student office of the schools to ask any questions on this.  You don’t want to be surprised later when your family has budgeted $5k (or whatever) for you to go to school in the US and think you have a scholarship that covers your costs and then you all of a sudden realize at the last minute that you have this very large and unexpected fee.

**US Schools give high but actually realistic numbers for Living Costs**

Don’t assume you can cut corners on housing. Let’s go back to Lehigh.  You may look at that $10,800 estimated housing costs that seem insane to you and think: “Over $10k a year for housing?!? Surely I can save on this cost by living off campus!”  However unless you have family/friends nearby that you can live with, there’s no guarantee you can find housing that you think is reasonably priced close to a college campus in the US.  And that assumes the school allows you to live off campus, Lehigh requires you too live on campus your first years, and many schools have similar policies.

Research rents in the area before you make any assumptions on your ability to find a room/apartment for cheaper than the housing plan. Take a look at this off-campus housing site to get a feel for rents around our example school, Lehigh: [https://financeadmin.lehigh.edu/content/rental-housing#:\~:text=Lehigh%20University%20offers%20rental%20housing%20for%20faculty%2C,Avenue%2C%20Bethlehem\*\*%205%20bedrooms%2C%202%20baths%2C%20$2%2C875/month](https://financeadmin.lehigh.edu/content/rental-housing#:~:text=Lehigh%20University%20offers%20rental%20housing%20for%20faculty%2C,Avenue%2C%20Bethlehem**%205%20bedrooms%2C%202%20baths%2C%20$2%2C875/month)  As that site shows, you’re looking at a low end cost of $600 per month (and probably have to be in a 12 month lease, and that may not include the cost of heat, electricity, water or wifi.) So you’ve saved\~$3k off the cost of living in the dorms— but it’s still not cheap by any means, and you now have to get yourself furniture and cooking equipment. $600 per month in rent/utilities is about the lowest cost you should plan for in most of the US.

Research your student housing options and costs before you assume anything,

**Meal Plan Costs are Actually a Bit Ridiculous**

Don’t assume the high price of a school meal plan is a total scam.  Again you might say to yourself: ""$5,000-$9,000 for 8-9 months of a school meal plan is ridiculous. I can feed myself for a lot cheaper than that.”  You will quickly learn that a) if you live in a dorm, full meal plans are typically required for at least the first year, partly because not all dorms offer any sort of adequate kitchen facility. It's also because US schools have learned that 17-18 year olds are typically not prepared to feed themselves a healthy and balanced diet, and when they have to worry about housing and feeding themselves, this will impact their level of academic success. 

In addition, a lot of the US college experience is tied into socializing and dining halls is where much of that socializing happens. If one of your reasons for going to the US for school is to make connections that will potentially help you in the future, you’re going to have a much harder time doing that if you can’t join your friends for meals or go out for coffee/tea or pizza or ice cream. 

Going back to Lehigh again, they require that freshmen are on at least the cheapest meal plan with gives 240 meals over the semester (not even 3 meals a day, but you’ll likely find this is plenty) and that costs $7,380 for the academic year (and doesn’t include the month between semesters.)  So basically you are paying over $900 per month for the 8 months school is in session.  And yeah, that's a lot of money. No lie.

The schools that allow you to live off campus will usually allow you to not buy the meal plan. Can you eat more cheaply than $900/month?  Definitely, but grocery costs (especially now) in the US are high—much higher than you are used to at home.  Even if you shop at discount stores and only buy things on sale, you will have a very hard time feeding yourself for less than $100 a week at an absolute minimum.  So yes, you can save here but again, realize that you are adding stress and time to focus on feeding yourself and are missing out on that socializing time with your peers.



Sorry this was so much, if you got this far, please realize I didn’t intend to scare you, but to give you a real idea of what this is going to cost and how to make sure you aren’t surprised later.  I am not a financial expert but if you have questions, ask them here and people will try to answer them.

Although it doesn't remain all of the time, I experience what feels like the pain from the low back and hips seems to wrap itself around my waist all the way to the front side of my abdomen.

This is primarily evident when I first wake up in the morning and get out of bed. Some days (like earlier today) the pain is so intense that I can barely walk, and I could literally scream at the top of my lungs (if I wasn't living in my apartment complex).

But here's another oddity of this. Typically, after I spend around 15 minutes moving about, using the restroom, getting dressed, etc., the part of the pain in the front doesn't seem as prevalent any longer (most days).

Well, in my case on days I'm off from work like today, I will then sit down at my laptop while enjoying one to three cups of coffee. During this time, I am also taking my handful of pills, which typically ends up allowing me to function throughout the day for the most part.

Now, having said all of this, I'll add another thing as well. I believe sometimes after the painkillers start wearing off, the pain might return again to the front side of my abdomen (in addition to where it usually is most of the time).

It turns out here where I live its difficult to get a Dr's appointment right now. You typically have to wait a long time. I have one with my 'new' PCP a week from today. I will bring a list with me.

Here’s where Kaliyug kicked in.

She shows up 20 minutes late, barely says hi, and spends half the time recording herself sipping coffee for her story. I laughed it off. Then she drops this line —

“I actually have a situationship right now but he’s being dry, so I thought I’d meet new people.”

I froze. Bro, what?? I literally became her backup serotonin source for the week. I paid the bill out of instinct (don’t know why), and she goes —

“You’re actually nice, I thought you’d be more alpha.” 😭😭😭

That “alpha” word broke something inside me.

Fast-forward — she unmatched the next day. No argument, no closure, just vanished like Thanos snapped her. Two days later, I see her same story location with some new guy. Probably another “non-alpha coffee experiment.”

I’m not even mad anymore. I’m just… amused. Bumble feels like the digital version of Kaliyug’s dating syllabus — people treating real connections like side quests for validation.

No one’s looking for love anymore — just distraction, attention, and a dopamine refill.

Anyway, I’ve deleted the app again. Maybe I’ll meet someone offline… or maybe I’ll just start worshipping WiFi Goddess, the true deity of Kaliyug. 🙏📱",1,1762883477.0,globaldate,1,1.0,False

The difference? I'm much more tired than when I drank caffeine, and far less productive.

That's the truth.

No memory improvements. No brain fog difference. No anxiety reduction. Honestly i'm less productive than before, probably about 50% as productive.

Caffeine made me feel good and locked in. I feel unplugged without it most of the time.

Moral of the story: If caffeine fuels you and makes you much more productive, then you should totally lean into it and leverage that.

I moved to a new neighbourhood about 6 months ago, and there’s a coffee shop opposite me that I started frequenting. 

Over time, I noticed a new guy had started, although I wouldn’t see him everytime I went in, and he wouldn’t always serve me. I obviously thought he was really cute but didn’t do anything about it. 

I followed the coffee stores social media page as they would also host some hobby events there in the evening that I was interested in going to, since I was new to the community and wanted to meet people. 

One day the social media page reposted something from the cute guys page. Naturally, in this day and age of social media giving you access to anyone and everyone, I clicked on his page (obviously as well because he had piqued my interest for some time now).

A few weeks later I bit the bullet and I sent him a message on Instagram asking him out for a drink/coffee if he was single, obviously. He responded almost immediately, stating that he would really like to as I’ve always seemed really ‘kind’ when coming into the shop, but that he had a girlfriend ‘at the moment’, and said he still hopes to see me come into the shop. 

I did not respond right away as I was at a bar downtown with my newfound girlfriends from the hobby club, and I noticed that he followed my page. He has since been one of the first to be viewing any stories I post, and has liked my actual page post. 

I have absolutely no intention of engaging with him further romantically, I have full respect for other people’s relationships and I very quickly but politely finished the conversation after his message. 

Obviously, in my own head, I still find him super super cute and it did sting a little that he had a girlfriend but I can cope with that, it is what it is. 

Please feel free to tell me if I’m reading too much into this, but the wording of his original message felt quite odd to me; like, open ended in a way? And the fact he is still engaging, albeit not directly to me - just really confuses me. I can put to bed the notion of us ever connecting romantically but it is hard when he is engaging with my stuff. 

I have since blocked him from seeing my stories so he cannot engage anymore.

What do people think of this? Am I crazy for thinking that this is him trying to show subtle interest despite being taken? Or am I reading too much into it? ",0,1762882866.0,dating_advice,8,0.33,False

My mouth is perfect lol. I have great teeth, I’ve been to dentists, ENTs, had endoscopy’s, etc. no one has found anything wrong with my mouth. I floss and tongue scrape daily. The bad breath comes and goes. If it was consistently my mouth it would be more consistent. My bad breath is reactive to what I eat

I have issues with dairy. Not an allergy, but it causes bowl problems and bad breath

Coffee makes me breath bad too

Within the last few years, I’ve had IBS like symptoms. Some foods (high in dairy, spicy foods, coffee sometimes) causing me to have to go to the bathroom within 30 minutes and it’s usually a Bristol type 6 or 7

I’ve found that my stomach lacks acid. And certain foods aren’t able to breakdown properly. I’ve been recommended to take Btane HCL vitamins. They help with digestion, but not always with bad breath.

Not trying to be mean here, but I’m not looking for “brush your teeth and floss after you eat”

It’s not something that should have to happen

I’d like advice, stories, facts, or info on ways to remove the bad breath or fix my gut issues completely since again, it’s coming from my gut not my mouth. Open to new ideas and ways of changing my diet maybe.

For example, I had eggs and chicken sausage this morning. Took my vitamin, bad breath.

I saw on here olipops have caused bad breath. I can try cutting those out

No sane person can say that I wanna be the first choice for every action film in this world !! If this was said by someone like Vidyut the world would've come to bully him brutally but since it was said by Tiger nobody bats an eye. On social media his pr shows how down to earth nice guy he is but he's not what he tries to show. He's nothing but someone who tries to copy everything from the legends like MJ to his co stars like Hrithik!!

He copies everything from Vidyut, from stunts to style to attitude everything. Vidyut has one signature famous stunt in Commando which he tried to replicate in the film Munna Michael with multiple cuts but failed miserably to do it.

Big fan of Hrithik but copies his looks, his dance, he's just another Harman Baweja. Netizens say he did something commendable in the film war but in reality he didn't, he just had bland expressions with voice modulations and people hyping it up as if he gave some heath ledger level performance.

Openly dissed Varun Dhawan for talking about Disha in coffee with kjo but flirts with then gf of Aditya roy, shraddha kapoor, hypocrisy!!

He's only nice in front of cameras, so I knew this guy who used to run this tiger fan club from haryana, some tiger shroff stuff username guy, he went to meet him in Mumbai during BMCM promotions, so much he went to meet him in his hotel or something but despite that he neither talked nor met him once moreover his guard shooed him away and that day he decided leave that fan page and never been active since then after publicly stating what actually happened.

In conclusion all these insiders of bollywood wear that nice human being mask as instructed by their pr, their pr got aggressive during the anti nepo movement and started projecting all the outsiders in negative light. They thought of giving tit for tat to the audience supporting outsiders but the audience showed them who the real boss is.

1oufvu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1oufvu9/how_do_i_navigate_this_situation_i_am_hopeless/,How do I navigate this situation? I am hopeless. M/30 F/27,"About 3 months ago I (‘M/30’) went on a roadtrip abroad with some of my friends. This was a travel group thing where we traveled with about 40 other people from our country. During our days of exploring a smaller group formed naturally, of like minded people. And there she (‘F/27’) was. 

I show her and liked her so I thought I would introduce myself and crack some jokes. It worked, we had the same sense of humor. In the course of the trip we kept finding ways to lose ourselves from our friends and walk around some sights and monuments together, admiring everything new in front of us at the same time. We had a great time overall. Not just with her mind you, but the whole group. We all exchanged socials before the trip ended and promised to get together back home.

Now you know how these things go, people rarely follow back on these promises. But we did. We gathered around a person’s house, ate together, had some laughs etc. But I also approached her again through socials. We chatted for a few days and asked her to grab some coffee. She told she would be glad but only as friends because she was in a relationship. I was a bit disappointed at that moment, but I really did want to continue our communication even as friends because I valued (and still do) her as a person. 

So we kept on texting, making jokes, commenting on stupid reels. Sometimes we talked on the phone and started talking about some more serious and deep subjects. It felt to me like this wasn’t a person that I knew for a month, but a person I knew for years. And as it turns out the same was true for her. Over time I sensed some feelings forming but I suppressed them as best as I could. Apparently I didn’t do that good of a job because she realized that I liked her and the craziest, most unbelievable thing of was that she like me too! IN the same exact way.

We talked and talked and figured we were both falling in love so fast. We had our differences yes, but we seemed to be so aligned on the very importan subjects of life. When I inquired about her current relationship she opened up and admitted that things were not great. After 6 years together there were no future plans, her bf apparently worried that she wouldn’t cook for him and didn’t want to move in together. He was not giving her enough attention outside of some weekend visits, or never bought her flowers etc. There many other examples, but I think you get the gist. On the contrary I was giving her the attention, care and love she always wanted.

So she wanted to break it off and she thinked all those problems opened her heart for someone else to slip in. I was ok with that. 
We fell in love so much deeper. I was invested so much in this, she made me feel things that I had forgotten about. She made me remember what it was like to be romantic and do romantic gestures and be appreciated for it. She made me feel alive, happy. And I saw her being happy too.

Then one day her bf goes over and proposes to her. And to my surprise she says she will think about it. The same day she called me to tell me that. Two days before I had asked her if she had decided what she wanted finally and she had said “I want you”.

To say I was devastated is an understatement. I didn’t fight with her, I just told her that a ring doesn’t fix years of neglect. She claimed that she cannot throw away 6 years when there is a chance to fix the relationship. I told her I don’t understand this and after a short exchange we hang up.

A few weeks later and after a lot of thought I decided that maybe I should go back to my original mindset of just keeping her in my life because I value her so much. We started talking a little bit again, I wanted to see how she was. And the crazy thing to me is that even after she said she would fight things out with her bf, she still says she misses me, she still misses my hug and my kiss (the only forms of physical affection we have had), she still values me and cares about me. And I believe her.

So here is the problem. I feel like I have no place in her life, but I feel so much for her, I care so much about her and I know she feels strong things for me too. But I also thing she is too afraid to let go of something she spent years developing and trying out something new (this has been confirmed more or less by her in not exactly these words). At the same time when I consider to let her go, cut all communications and let her go on her way, I feel gutted, sad and depressed.

To be honest I am at a loss. I know that I am a terrible person for pursuing and loving a woman who’s not free and the pain I am feeling is my punishement. But I didn’t choose to fall in love, I didn’t even think it in the cards for me at this point in my life.

I just bought my first house and am so excited to furnish it but don't know where to start! It's a 1930's Spanish Mediterranean style home, near the beach in California. I'm going to decorate the living room first (pic above), and I'd love to decorate it in a way that's consistent to the home's style/location. It's a big room -- 18' x 14' -- and is right at the front of the house. One thing I know I like is this rug vintage rug (9x12), and I want to keep this coffee table (pics below)

https://preview.redd.it/g6jx4v1ixn0g1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60f22554ad9f09dbccdd69c6ec4a15a4f35ab296

But I cannot, for the life of me, figure out what else to do in this room. Starting with, what type of couch to get for in front of the windows? I want it to be comfortable, but not to look like big sectional-style basement furniture (which we already have a lot of, in our basement). Something more modern/contemporary? Slipcover, to go with the vintage/euro vibe? Would love advice on the couch, but also anything else on how to make this room look pretty!

Here are two couches I've been considering:

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Denver Nuggets vs. Sacramento Kings: A Royal Rout or a Rocky Road?**

The Denver Nuggets, fresh off a 7-2 start that’s making NBA analysts sound like broken record players (“*They’re UNSTOPPABLE!*”), will face the Sacramento Kings on November 11, 2025, in a clash that’s less “Game of Thrones” and more “Game of Whose Defense Sleeps More.” With the Nuggets favored by 8.5 points and the Kings nursing a 3-7 record, this game feels like a chess match where Sacramento forgot to bring a queen—specifically, Domantas Sabonis, who’s listed as questionable with a rib injury. Let’s break it down with the precision of Nikola Jokic and the humor of a Twitter thread at 2 a.m.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Denver’s Odds Are as Cold as a Calf Injury

The Nuggets’ decimal odds of 1.27 (implied probability: \~79%) suggest bookmakers view this as a near-foregone conclusion. For context, that’s the statistical equivalent of betting on a penguin to survive in Antarctica—logical, but still a safe bet. Their -8.5 spread? That’s the NBA’s way of saying, “Denver’s winning, but let’s make you *work* for your victory parade.”

The Kings, meanwhile, hover around 3.95 odds (\~20% chance), which is about the same odds of me understanding why Sacramento’s offense (23rd in the league) thinks “transition” means going from bad to worse. Their defense? A 27th-ranked sieve that leaks more than a lukewarm coffee cup in a sauna.

---

### News Digest: Injuries, Momentum, and Why the Kings Need a Net

Denver’s star-studded core is as healthy as a vegan at a salad bar. Nikola Jokic is on a triple-double tear, averaging 25.2/13/11.9 while looking like a wizard who’s just discovered gravity. Jamal Murray, despite a nagging calf injury, is expected to play—though his “day-to-day” status feels less like an injury and more like a Netflix password shared with a roommate. Still, Murray’s rebounding prowess against Sacramento (5.3 RPG) is the basketball equivalent of a Swiss Army knife: versatile, unexpected, and

I’ve been talking with a lot of parents lately who feel overwhelmed by how fast AI is moving, especially when their kids already use tools like ChatGPT better than they do.

So over the past few months, we built something small but meaningful:  
**Stop Worrying About AI — The 4-Step Family Guide.**

It’s a calm, research-backed system that helps parents:

* Understand how AI fits into learning (not replaces it)
* Set simple, healthy rules at home
* Talk about tech without turning it into conflict
* Raise curious, responsible, *AI-smart* kids

We launched it this week at **Parents2AI**, and included **5 free bonuses** for early buyers like screen-time templates, AI rule cards, and school-use checklists.

If you’re a parent who wants to stay in charge of how AI shapes your home, this might help:  
👉 \[parents2ai.com\]

If you’re not a parent but have seen kids using AI in unexpected ways, I’d still love your perspective.  
We’re collecting real stories to improve the next version.

Thanks for reading — this project’s been built with a lot of coffee, and even more heart.

Crumbs on almost all the tables , chairs and surrounding area littered with wrappers, bits of papers and crumbs. Wanted to leave but that's the only decent looking outlet. I had a meeting in 30 minutes. So I proceeded to place orders. $12 for one puny steaming hot cappuccino and palm sized wholemeal spinach feta wrapped. I'm tiny so you could imagine that tiny palm sized wrapped. Teehehehehe. At the time of swiping the card, the cashier gave the look that asked for tips. I was thinking that, look babe, your outlet is messy and I got to stand here to place my orders and waited for my food. So, I pressed tab 'No tips'. She didn't thank me.

Though the wrapped was puny, it did fill me up halfway eating it. While I was eating, one well groomed gentleman came in with well groomed poodle. The fur was shiny that it blinded me for a moment. 😂. Gentleman sat down on the next table. Then he got up to tie down that pooch to the chair. When he turned to walk to the counter, pooch decided to lift her leg and relieve herself near my chair. Thinking that's the end? Hell No! She defecated as well. I immediately stopped eating. The gentleman looked embarrassed and apologetic. Quickly grabbed some brown napkins from the accessories station to clean up. Then he went to bathroom. Just when he came out thinking that finally he could place orders, holy moly! Miss Poochie decided to create 2nd Round of mess! 🤣 My quick reflex saved my precious shoes and pants from caking in unwanted fragrance.  🤣🤣🤣. This time the gentleman face turned beetroot red. Me? My eyes delivered slingshot of arrows however, the gentleman's porcelain appearance and demeanor managed to dull the arrows. I was afraid that I might end up breaking the porcelain. The last thing I want to do is to witness a gentleman's tears rolling down his porcelain cheeks. So I turned around and finished up my coffee and left. ...

I have an older Nespresso, about 9yo. It seems like it was taking a long time to brew the coffee and I did the descaling process and it got better. But every one in a while takes about 3x as long to brew. I've used the descaling product about 3 times in the last 6 months. Is my machine dying?

I couldn't post the picture but it is the machine with the smaller pods and a metal handle that you need to press down for brewing.",0,1762881699.0,nespresso,1,0.5,False
1oufet7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/1oufet7/foulborn_doedres_scorn_ll_crit_id_occultist_build/,Foulborn Doedre's Scorn LL Crit ID Occultist Build,"With the new Foulborn Doedre's Scorn, I finally got to play one of my favorite builds of all time again, even in a small private league, so I wanted to show it off for others to give it a try.  

For anyone who has not played this sort of build: it's one of the smoothest and most comfortable mappers you can ever play, especially with Breach's mechanics.  The way it works is that we are overriding our own curses to continually proc Doom Blast on enemies, which is automated via Vixen's Entrapment auto-casting three other curses every time you cast the curse connecting to Impending Doom in your helm.  With all of the AOE scaling on the tree plus Occultist's own AOE per power charge scaling, even without Awakened Spell Cascade you end up hitting the entire screen with each cast.  

----
**Important Mechanics**

**Curse order** is EXTREMELY important but very simple to follow.  You are going to be using three good curses of your choice and one junk curse which is being overwritten.  All you need to know is that the curse in the top left of your gloves is a purposefully useless one (I use Conductivity but it genuinely does not matter).  

The **curse you manually cast** is *mostly* irrelevant unless you start using a Balance of Terror gem.  If you do choose to use one, your manually-casted curse is what you are using to proc it.  

**Cast speed** is mostly flexible and you shouldn't ever really have an issue but if your cast speed is too low, your Vixen's won't be auto-proccing Impending Doom for you which ruins the entire feel of the build.  Just keep this in mind.  

**Mana cost** is extremely tight for this build.  With a level 21 clarity, -mana on each piece of jewelry (including one with -8 via catalysts), and even some -mana cost on the tree, I can just barely sustain my casts indefinitely.  While it's not required to reach this level of mana sustain, it does make the build feel loads better, especially in Breach.  During Breach Fortresses, for example, I just stand in the center, hold right click, and move my mouse around in a circle while sipping on coffee.  

**Overlaps** are important to understand and will literally double or triple your damage.  When you cast your curses with spell cascade, you'll notice that the edges will start to overlap as you get more AOE scaling.  When a target is standing inside this overlap, you are quite literally doubling your damage since ID is proccing twice.  With Occultist, that AOE is very easy to take advantage of but it's still something to get used to and notice.

**FAQ**

*Is this version better than Paak's DOT-based build?*

No, but I already played an ignite character as my league starter and did not want to play another right afterwards.  Paak's ignite and poison versions are both exceptional builds, and are even likely better bossers than mine since you only need to cast once every few seconds to keep the boss ticking down.  With that said, I also don't think Paak's build is strictly better than mine either.  There's a lot to be said about simply one-tapping the screen instead of waiting for things to tick down, not to mention not needing to find sources of proliferation.  

*What are the main weaknesses of the build?*

**Temporal Bubbles** are the worst modifier you will ever come across, to the point that you may even find a rare mob or two you outright cannot kill.  The bubble prevents you from off-screening it and when you get inside, it completely fucks up your ID proccing.  I can still kill the vast majority of these but there have been a handful of bestiary mobs which I've just left behind. 

Besides that, there's very little that you'll come across that will give you a problem.  I've been using this build to clean up my league challenges and kill ubers, for example, and it's pretty comfortable with both.  

*Is this a boss killer?*

No.  The DPS and survivability are high enough that I've been using it to kill ubers regardless but if you are not comfortable in high end content, please do not rely on this build to clear it.  The main problem is that the build ""only"" has 15-20m DPS on a good day, and that DPS only comes from you standing still and casting.  Unless you really understand ubers and can take advantage of good positioning, you're going to struggle.  

*What are the CDR/Cast Speed breakpoints?*

It's important to note that there aren't *really* breakpoints for the build in how you'd normally understand them in regards to builds like Cast on Crit.  However, there *are* ideal levels of cast speed to ensure maximum DPS uptime without encountering ""dead casts"".  Dead casts are when you cast faster than your Vixen's proc rate which *does* cut your damage by a lot.  Please just make a copy of [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J-yVLmDhKqKNE8QecsPnZgNR2TDGDm41f-1tdC_BxQA/edit?gid=1230763965#gid=1230763965) spreadsheet and keep track of your own cast speed, action speed, and CDR.  I promise you that the build is EXTREMELY flexible and outside of some very weird circumstances so you shouldn't actually have any issues but it's still something to keep in mind. 

*Can I level with this build?*

Actually yes, and that might be one of the most attractive things about it.  Run whatever you want until level 39, equip Doedre's and Vixen's, and you start one tapping the entire game.  I'd recommend following Paak's guide for leveling specifically, since my build is low life and thus not something you'll run until your 70s at least, but it's EXTREMELY comfortable and fast to get going on.

**Upgrades from the POB**

As mentioned in the beginning, I'm playing in a private league so there's some glaring openings in it that trade league would fix.  My entire build outside of half the Shavronne's Wrapping and the Void Battery are self-found/self-crafted so it's been an effort, to say the least. **Balance of Terror**, is a massive upgrade and something I'll never be able to use.  There's lots of options in which you want to use but I think the Temporal Chains action speed one is the best just for opening up numerous T17/16.5 maps mods for you to run.  

The other largest upgrade would be 2x **Awakened Spell Cascade**.  These are expensive but will not only boost your clear by a massive amount, but can also open up a third overlap in your curses creating a 50% more damage boost.  I also have not tested it but it *might* enable you to run some -AOE maps but I cannot confirm this.

**Delve rings** are a tech that I would need to test but I am fairly sure would enable me to drop Skittering Runes as an anoint and put on Tranquility.  Certain rings dropped in the Aura/Curse nodes have a suffix that give AOE for hex skills.  With Awakened Spell Cascade, you can likely get away with just one delve ring but without, two are more necessary.  Adding Tranquility instead of Skittering Runes, though, is a massive ~12-15% DPS boost alongside some extra ES and something I'd absolutely shoot for in trade league.  

Better grafts are also something I'm pushing for and am hoping for but are gonna be a challenge. My Hardening Uulgraft is likely what I'm ending the league with due to the rarity of the suffix but in an ideal world I would have that plus an Endurance Charge on Hit prefix.  Replicating Eshgraft is the biggest upgrade here though with its %ES prefix.  I've gotten it once already but the rest of it was fairly trash so I've kept my current one for more graftblood gained.  Ideally I'd get %ES, %grafblood gained, and skill CDR for more consistent shock application. 

Finally, getting more levels and a better Watcher's Eye are the two main things left for me.  Two more levels lets me get Faith and Steel to bring my attack block up to 74%.  For the Watcher's Eye, my dream is the Zealotry node I already have combined with Discipline Spell Block, which would cap my spell block.  

I think all of the above are more than doable in trade league and would push your build beyond mine without too much extra effort.  Otherwise, please let me know if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer.",4,1762881680.0,PathOfExileBuilds,0,1.0,False

Captain Silva knew her actions would have grave consequences, but now that she was in the office of the Star Fleet Admiral she couldn't help feeling the weight of her circumstances.

While the older man studiously pretended to not have noticed her (likely to let her better stew in her own anxiety), she studied the office in turn.

Just like many other spaces decorated with Snake Kiss fashion in mind there was an abundance of physical art pieces, from paintings and statues to painted reliefs on the walls; she knew many would have found such opulence a waste when neural implants and AR displays could make even bare walls come to life with beautiful decor, but as a people that grew out of enclosed habitats enriching their living spaces with their own touch would always be part of their identity.

The same philosophy was mirrored in the Admiral's choice of very distinct red-white-blue coloured hair, a choice that had earned him the whispered nickname of *Admiral Colgate*, a reference that she never understood, but as things stood she didn't feel any of the hilarity that usually came with any mention of the Admiral in question.

""Captain Silva, I won't question your motivations"" the voice of the older man brought her out of her musing ""I already read the after action report and unlike some other people I find no fault in how you cam up with your decisions. What I *will* question is your actions.""

Despite knowing that talking back to a superior was a massive breach of protocol she still had to put effort into not being any more obvious about her frustration than simply tightening her fists.

""Sir, I felt that the situation required immediate action and while I agree that the end results weren't an optimal outcome, I'd still come to the same conclusions and take the same decisions if I was given a chance to do it all over.""

""Not an optimal outcome"" the Admiral repeated almost mockingly ""You have a gift for understating things Captain, I'd say that starting a war with the Gojid Union is *pretty damn suboptimal*.""

""Sir, they had captured allied personnel, refused to give them up when confronted about it and threatened Marcel Frasier on several occasions"" she defended herself ""We were tasked with defending the Exchange Program station and its occupants and that's what we did.""

""And to do so you crossed over into Gojid territory, when you had *specific* orders to prioritize hiding our presence"" he rebuked her harshly ""I also would like to remind you that it was Frasier and his partner that crossed the border first, meaning that when Captain Sovlin confronted them and then retrieved their craft when they refused to comply he was performing his own duties.""

""Sir, he still forced personnel not under his own government jurisdiction on his vessel and then proceded to illegally detain a member of Cornucopia's military.""

""Personnel that had come from a state that cut off any contact with its neighbors overnight"" he pointed out ""I agree that the way he went about it wasn't exactly squeaky clean, but I can't begrudge their Captain for trying to acquire intel. I also agree that his treatment of Frasier was appalling, but we're here to talk about how you dealt with the situation.""

""Sir, upon confrontation they tried to escape"" she struggled to say while maintaining a polite tone ""Had we let them they could have informed their government of our presence, to say nothing of what they could have done to their prisoners.""

""And your decision to shoot out their engine worked out so well, didn't it?"" he asked sarcastically ""They still managed to get out a distress signal, meaning we still had to let them go, but not before we had given them a nice story to tell about how we invaded their territory, shot their patrol and boarded their ship.""

""There was significant concern that the lives of their hostages were at risk, rending their craft combact immobile and ineffective before a boarding action is standard procedure, especially when any attempt to negotiate were simply ignored.""

""I'm not questioning the situation you found yourself in dammit!"" the Admiral shouted, bringing his fist down on the desk in a fir of anger ""But surely you realize what public perception of your action will be like once news of it spread through the Federation! Scary alien predators attack a war hero with tactics straight out of the Arxur playbook and send a team of stomping triggerhappy musclehead to take over their bridge!""

""Sir, with all due respect, are you suggesting that I should have just ignored the situation"" she asked frostily.

""No, I'm saying that had least you should have had the decency to do things *right* and disable their communication capability first!"" he corrected her to her own surprise ""We always knew that our eventual reveal would be a hard task given Federation propaganda, but I can't think of a worst first meeting than one that end with them having to scrap the brains of their own people from the ceiling!""

She was left silent by the outburst, something that the Admiral took advantage of to continue: ""I know it doesn't look like but I understand why you did what you did Captain, I really do, were I not your own superior I'd even approve of it, it's everyone else that's coming down on us like a sack of bricks!""

He sighed tiredly before further explaining in a defeated tone: ""Captain Acosta tells me the Venlil are worried about our sudden display of *predatory aggression*, Cornucopia and their flunkies want us to take responsibility for starting this conflict, the people back home all but ordered me to nail you to a cross for your stunt and I just got a priority message by courier from the Sol Union which is basically the most polite way they could find to tell me we they're reinstating Admiral Cheng effect immediate before sending him our way and if we got a problem with that then it's *too fucking bad*! God, what a shitshow...""

Silva wasn't sure if she deserved the scrutiny that the Admiral was implying, but she could empathize with his obvious stress over the situation.

She had a feel the full consequences of her actions had still to get into motion.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In one of the many marketplaces on one of the many rather rustic cities on the planet of Tidling there was a rather unusual sight: a turquoise furred wolfman was walking down the main road.

Someone who was insufficiently cosmopolitan might have mistaken him for one of the rare people from the remote Bliss, but anyone familiar with Exotic Transfer culture would know that his body was simply a carefully crafted imitation, the clearly unnatural colour a courtesy toward the only naturalized Exotic population.

He was still a magnet for attention, his clean business suit and square glasses only putting into stark contrast the obviously non-human traits like the low hanging tail or the triangular ears.

He also had some rather persistent stalkers, but he doubted anyone but himself would have noticed.

Sure, between the olive skin, amber eyes and abundance of LED strips woven in their clothings they made for a decent impression of a couple of Centaurian tourists, but they were too *confident* about walking under an open sky to be fully convincing; as a people for which enclosed habitats were everyday life and that mainly interacted with the outside world through teleoperation, every Centaurian was agoraphobic to some degree, something that his bold pursuers clearly weren't good at pretending.

He briefly debated with himself to try again to lose them, but after the third time a *convenient* road obstruction cut off his escape he decided to see if perhaps they were open to a meeting.

He eventually found a small cafe, asked the cute waitress for a table for three and sat himself to wait.

He didn't have to wait long before his two stalkers joined him at the table, two middle aged women similar enough that they might have been twins; that alone gave him a pretty big clue as to their possible identity.

""Your service is once again required"" the woman on the left said out of the blue.

""Not even going to say hello? Not a *so good to see you* or *sorry for not getting back to you in the last ten years*?"" he casually bantered.

""The situation at the Cornucopia border is rapidly deteriorating"" the one on the right continued as if he didn't speak ""For the sake of you homeland you need to go back in the field.""

He never knew which *homeland* he was supposed to be working for, they had always been pretty tight lipped back at the facility about who was funding the project, he wouldn't have been surprise if neither did they for that matter, but he knew he had more than earned his retirement from doing wetwork for shadowy organizations.

""I'm going to go with... no thanks"" he shot back drily ""Last time you said I was done, erased from your roster, crafted new identity kind of done. Now you come back and try to drag me in again? Don't you have some other ethically questionable project you can throw at the problem?""

""The situation is without precedent"" the left woman told him ""Your experience will serve you well in navigating unforeseen circumstances.""

He wasn't sure if that meant they no longer ran those kind of projects (unlikely if the read he had of them was correct) or if they didn't trust them with whatever assignement they wanted to saddle him with, his answer wasn't going to change anyway.

""I'm afraid you'll have to find some other experience lackey then"" he countered before catching the attention of the cute blonde waitress ""I'll have a coffee cream with cocoa, my friends were leaving, trouble with their hotel.""

He had just started to relax and do his best to ignore his unwanted visitors when the woman on the right spoke up again: ""That's why we also enlisted your siblings.""

He froze.

After long enough that it was probably conspicuous he manged to affect a nonchalant tone, but he doubted he was fooling anyone: ""I thought I didn't have any sibling, you were *quite* insistent that despite sharing a genetic template none of us was related. I actually kind of blame that for how aggressively my *sister* was flirting with me.""

""Nevertheless they have been already been contacted and they agreed to perform one last mission"" the woman on the left told him.

He went back to try to project an image of casual indifference, but his mind was already abuzz with thoughts; he probably shouldn't let if affect him like that, *those* weren't his siblings and even if they had been they all were some manner of crazy, not the kind of people he should get himself involved with now that he had managed to build for himself a semblance of a normal life.

He *really* shouldn't get involved in the coming mess...

He set his arms on the table and took off his glasses, as soon as he did any trace of carefree whimsy bled from his body, leaving behind the sort of deadly focus that called to mind the animal he shared many traits with: ""What did you have in mind?""

... he still was going to get involved because despite everything he never managed to shake off his superfluous protective streak and he just *knew* the rest of his siblings would get into more trouble they could deal with.

Especially the damned nymphomaniac.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If asked, she was sure many would have struggled to reconcile her obvious pleasure seeking behaviour with the career choice of being a bounty hunter; those people clearly lacked any sense of adventure.

Bounty hunting was a great job: lots of chances to visit new places, to get to know new people and to exercise any amount of violence she saw fit.

Besides, as long as there were two people left in the Galaxy, someone would need her to right the wrongs of someone else.

Like her current situation: her target had hidden on an orbital colony around some middling Lesser System she didn't care to remember the name of and her client was willing to pay a nice sum to have him dragged back home to face his charges of aggravated fraud.

She usually would have taken more time before moving in for capture, there was some entertainment to be found in seeing how long it took before someone noticed the literally blood red wolfgirl stalking them, but her old *associates* had recently got in contact with her about taking back her old job.

She normally wouldn't have cared, being a freelancer meant she didn't have to hear complaints about small things like *collateral damage* or *excessive force*, but the promise of a certain turquoise lupine fellow being also called to arms was enough to fill her with impatient anticipation.

It had been a while since they had met and she wondered if he still clung to his silly belief of their supposed relation or if this time he would be more open to some *fun*.

She shook herself to regain her focus, she might have been *literally* hard-wired to chase any sort of high but, as much as she hated to admit it, work *did* come before pleasure.

Besides, it's not like one precluded the other.

Despite approaching him from head on, the middle aged man never suspected a thing, her own casual pace helping her blend in the crowds despite her unusual appearence.

By the time she was close enough to take in his completely average looks her hand had nonchalantly slipped inside her jacket, until she could grasp at the handle of the heavy machete hidden underneath.

She briefly debated the best way to go about it, it had been far too long since she got the chance to test the edge of her blade, but she finally resigned herself to do it the *boring* way.

When the pommel cracked against the man nose it still made a satisfying *crunch* and even as he stumbled back blood managed to land on her hand.

She quickly hurried to subdue the struggling man, slapping some restraining bands over his wrists and ankles, then she had to fish out the ID card that proved her status as a licensed bounty hunter before the approaching police could get any wrong idea.

Even as she gave her usual spiel to the officer in charge she had to force herself to ignore the pleasant shiver that went down her spine at the warm feeling still sticking to her hand and at the thought she might soon get to experience it far more often.

She couldn't help it, she was made that way.

To give you a small overview of what I'm like, I'm more than capable of laughing at myself and I'm into football (I play 5 a side football when I'm not injured - which is worryingly often and I'm starting to believe I might be made of Quavers), reading, writing but never finishing anything I start, music (my taste is varied), photography, crime dramas, true crime, and I've recently decided to start collecting Pokemon cards again.

I just know what my opinions are.

I came across an all-in-one espresso machine that’s normally priced at $2,195, but it’s currently on sale for $440. This would be my first machine, and while I’ve read that all-in-ones can be a mixed bag, the deal seems hard to ignore.

I’m hoping to get some advice from folks here before pulling the trigger:
	•	Has anyone used this particular machine or a similar all-in-one setup long-term?
	•	Are the maintenance or reliability issues really that bad?
	•	Would you personally recommend going with separate components instead?
	•	If you were starting fresh today with a budget under $1,500 (machine + grinder), what setup would you buy?
	•	Any underrated machines or brands you wish you’d bought first?

Lately, we've been spending a lot of time together: talking, cooking together, watching movies. All friendly stuff, right? Now it has graduated to holding hands, long hugs, her head on my shoulder, her head in my lap, little forehead kisses, that kind of thing. Yet, for some reason, it still feels, platonic?

A few extra details:

1. We’ve never gone out anywhere together. She’ll say things like  “I want coffee” or, “we should try out their special menu,” or, “want to go to place Z next weekend?” But it does not feel like she’s asking *me* to go, more like she’s just making conversation.

i do still have some minor GI symptoms which i think is just from ibs/anxiety. i at least know it’s not from celiac because my bloodwork has been normal for years and i got a repeat endoscopy a couple months ago that came back normal! my doctors are very happy with this but i always get comments from family/friends who don’t understand why im so strict about everything. it gets really tiring hearing stuff like “i know someone with celiac and they still eat out”, “why aren’t you eating that, it doesn’t have gluten”, “maybe you’ll grow out of it”

i really wish i could be more lax about everything but it doesn’t seem worth it to me, especially with the stomach issues i still deal with, like why would i ever risk making that 10x worse? plus because i haven’t been glutened in years, i don’t know how severe my reaction would be at this point (i hear it gets worse over time) so i have a huge fear around it. i have emetophobia so vomiting is one of my biggest fears and the main reason i’m so afraid of gluten, because that could be a possible symptom
 
i guess i want to know if anyone else has felt this way and how you have navigated “taking risks.” i’ve been thinking of eating at more restaurants that aren’t 100% gluten free but take it very seriously and have good reviews from people with celiac/allergies. the fact that i’m considering this is a big step for me but it still gives me a lot of anxiety

Even though I was not able to serve I have been able to and have enjoyed being able to support the Warfighter as a contractor for the Army and Navy for these last 7 years and hope to continue for at least a few more. 

I decided to open my CCAR menu 1, spaghetti with beef and sauce. The first 4 picks are the bag and the contents. Loads of snacks with a redesigned main pouch for maximum squeezability. You can shotgun it right into your gaping maw. Before the review they are a few things I noticed. First off the only thing with caffeine is the gum. You do get 5 pieces though, so spaced out through the day it will get you by. The next is that everything except the strawberry jam and teriyaki stick are 150+ calories. The jam is 70 and the meat stick is 100. Only one drink, this easily could have had 2 or 3 with one protein and the other isotonic. Also no utensils, but then again with everything designed to be eaten on the go you don't really need any. 

Overall these are designed for small units that are unsupported during the first phases of a military conflict and allow them to carry maximum nutrition in minimum space. According to the article they can carry 5 days of food in a 3 day footprint thus allowing more room for other mission essential supplies. 

I'm not sure how many meals I'll split it into because it really is a lot of food. But for breakfast I ate the peanut butter and strawberry jam, the chocolate chip toaster pastry and the coconut almond high energy bar. I was going to eat the chocolate energy gel but I'm going to make a chocolate protein coffee tomorrow and add that to it. I'll try it before and report back. I supplemented the meal with a Ghost peaches flavor energy drink since this was actually lunchtime and I wasn't feeling in the mood for coffee. The Ghost is like a 9/10 and reminds me of the NAFR peach drink. Onto the real food.

What can be said about MRE peanut butter and jam that hasn't been said? Always great and always great together. Both 10/10. You can never go wrong with them. Unless you don't like strawberry jam, shout-out to MKR 🤣

The chocolate chip toaster pastry was fine. It was dry and crumbly but otherwise tasted fine. There's not a strong chocolate flavor to me. It went well covered in the PB & J. 7/10 for pastry. I'd never turn it down but another flavor might be better. 

Last but not least the coconut almond high energy bar. The texture reminds me of the no bake cookies or energy bars that you see folks make for snacks. Very crumbly and just bound together. Not a bad thing but it falls apart easily. Not as bad as the toaster pastry but close. In the kind of melts away in the mouth. It has a pleasant coconut flavor with a pronounced cream flavor on the front. The first ingredient is cream powder so that makes since (in the US at least ingredients are listed in terms of the highest amount first). I don't really taste the almonds but they're there and provide bulk. It also has a nice hint of cocoa in the background that ties it together like a healthy almond joy. This is definitely a must try and 9.5/10. 

I'll post the rest as I eat it over the rest of the day and possibly tomorrow. 

Here's to the Army and Navy and to the battles they have won; here's to America's colors, the colors that never run. May the wings of Liberty never lose a feather. ",12,1762880961.0,MRE,2,0.93,False

I caught their eye once, just a fleeting moment, and my stomach did this strange, sudden flip. It wasn’t anything obvious, just a quiet exchange that felt heavier than it should’ve. They didn’t look away immediately, as if they were waiting for me to say something, but I didn’t. I wasn’t sure what I’d say, or why I felt this pull I couldn’t explain.

So, I just kept sipping my coffee, pretending I wasn’t thinking about them. But I couldn’t help it. I wondered if they’d felt that brief, strange connection too.

1oueyw2,https://i.redd.it/r5h91kidtn0g1.png,Just got SWE offer from Microsoft after 1 year of grinding LeetCode — lucky to have guidance from my ex-Amazon sister,"Hi everyone,

I’m super excited to share my journey after one year of nonstop prep. It’s been exhausting, but finally, it’s over — I got a Software Engineer offer from Microsoft!

I’ll share everything that helped me: my LeetCode prep strategy, how I built my resume, how I reached out for referrals on LinkedIn, how I approached interviews (both technical and behavioral), and what I learned about what interviewers actually expect.

Of course, this is just my experience, so take it as one data point. It might not work exactly the same for everyone — but hopefully, it gives you some insight or motivation.

First, to get interviews, your resume is everything. From my experience, metrics are key.

If your resume doesn’t have any numbers, fix that immediately. Recruiters (who are usually non-technical) care about measurable impact. Add metrics like:

Reduced system latency by 20%

Boosted user engagement by 15%

Improved efficiency / revenue / load time

Anything quantifiable helps because it’s easy to understand. Without metrics, they can't understand what you have done, cuz they are non-tech. Imagine you are a swe and read a resume from a doctor without metrics:D, it's like read alien language.

For referrals, just search something like “software engineer at Google site:linkedin.com” on Google or directly on LinkedIn. Then message people politely.

Keep your message short and highlight 2-3 impressive things about yourself — maybe a project, past experience, or key achievement.

Not everyone will reply, and that’s totally fine. Just keep trying. Some people do it for the referral bonus, but many also genuinely want to help. If you still get no response, apply directly — sometimes companies simply have too many candidates or outdated job posts. Don’t get discouraged; just keep going.

About technical interviews, for me, each technical round was about 1 hour — usually:

\~30 mins discussing past experience

\~30 mins solving a LeetCode problem

Tip: Be ready to talk deeply about everything on your resume. They will ask. For each role or project, having 4–5 bullet points is enough. I practiced with ChatGPT acting as an interviewer, which helped a lot.

Now, about LeetCode prep — the most exhausting part for most of us 😅

In my experience, interview questions are usually medium-level and clean, not crazy hard. Let me explain:

Online assessments might include hard problems, since you just submit code automatically cuz there's no interviewers here.

But live interviews are different. Interviewers are often senior engineers with 5–6+ years of experience. They need to do their work everyday and can't remember every tricky DSA trick — they just want to see how you communicate, reason, and approach problems.

A friend at FAANG told me a funny story: She was sitting next to a senior engineer who had an interview at 9 a.m., and at 8 a.m. he was just chilling with a cup of coffee, picking a random top LeetCode question to ask. So don't be so stressful:D

So focus on mastering common patterns and top \~150 LeetCode problems, especially the medium ones. Learn to solve them cleanly and explain your thought process clearly.

That’s probably enough for now — this post is already long 😅

If you have any questions, feel free to comment or DM me. I’m happy to help however I can.

(Btw, my sister — who guided me a lot — is an ex-Amazon engineer and even co-authored a blog on AWS. If you ever really need help urgently, we’re both open to doing a quick call to share what we know.)

I'm 35, 6'5, male, 280lb currently. I have been eating this way for 4 days so far no bad side effects but probably because I had a pretty high meat way of eating before (I just always ate burgers with bread very little veggies and I ate a ton) 
My plan to stay cost effective was essentially to buy a 10lb tube of hamburger meat and a 60ct pack of eggs then split it up. Im a pretty simple man so just adding salt and cooking 4 days worth together in a pot at a time before dividing it up into 4 containers. 

Daily Food amounts:

1lb of fatty ground beef. 
8 Eggs. 
Drained fat goes back on top once put into containers. 
Salt. 
All cooked together in one pot nothing fancy. 

1 cup black coffee in the morning. 


Thats it. Im looking for real body fat loss results before I start getting too into the nuances of tweaking things a lot for like muscle building etc. Ill definitely look at increating the ground beef amount if I have any issues associated with not eating enough. I dont have any sort of chronic illness or mental illness thing. Day one amd two I ate my days food in one sitting. Yesterday I ate half felt full, ate the other half later. Today I forgot to bring my food to work with me so ill just eat it tonight and try for one sitting.

Deja Vu

I

The alarm clock rang at six o’clock sharp.
It always did.

Tamara silenced it with a practiced motion, the same one she had done every morning since moving into the apartment. The yellow clock blinked once, as if relieved. Outside, dawn leaned against the window, pale and clean.

She dressed, packed her lunch—rice, an egg, apple slices—and stepped into the hallway. Mr. Flores, three doors down, raised his coffee mug.

“Morning, Miss Tamara! Early start again?”

She smiled. “Morning. You know me.”

He laughed exactly once, half cough, half chuckle. The bus arrived at 7:12 a.m. sharp, headlights cutting through the thin mist. A woman with a white dog sat two seats ahead.

By evening, Tamara had forgotten most of the day’s details except that she’d lived them all before: the same conversation, the same folder on her desk, the same feeling of being remembered by something that shouldn’t.

That night she wound the clock, though it hadn’t needed winding in years. Its tick filled the dark like a slow, steady breath.

II

The alarm clock rang at six o’clock sharp.
It always did.

Tamara silenced it, though the window was still dark. Streetlamps glowed against what should have been morning. The sky looked heavy, the color of deep water.

She told herself she had woken early. Or late.

The second hand on the clock hesitated at twelve before moving on. She packed her lunch—rice, an egg, apple slices—but the foil was already wrinkled. She smoothed it flat, unsure when she had used it last.

Outside, Mr. Flores raised his mug.
“Morning, Miss Tamara! Early start again?”

The same laugh, the same cough. The air smelled faintly of rain though the pavement was dry. She wondered if he’d worn that shirt yesterday, or if she only remembered it that way.

The bus arrived at 7:12 p.m., headlights bright against what the world still called morning. She blinked at the streetlights overhead, then at the clock on her wrist. Both said different things.

At work—the same desk, the same papers—her supervisor handed her the same assignment, smiling with yesterday’s words. The wall clock read noon but the windows showed dusk.

By the time she reached home, her pulse had fallen into step with the ticking. The alarm was ringing when she entered. She hadn’t wound it. She was sure she hadn’t.


---

III

The alarm clock rang at six o’clock sharp.
It always—

Tamara pressed the switch, but the sound didn’t stop right away. It hung in the air like a thread of light. When it finally ended, she realized the curtains were glowing orange, not gold.

She rose slowly. The hallway outside was dim, the shadows too long for morning.

“Morning, Miss Tamara! Early start again?”

Mr. Flores’s voice came from somewhere behind her, though his door was closed. The smell of coffee drifted faintly through the air—burnt, as if reheated too many times.

The bus came down the street, headlights slicing through fog that shimmered like frost. She stepped aboard. The driver nodded without looking. Outside the window, day and night flickered like two cards being shuffled.

At work, the lights hummed. Papers on her desk were dated yesterday, the ink still wet. Her hands trembled as she turned them over; on the back of one sheet was her own handwriting, the same lines she’d filled out before.

That night—or morning—the alarm clock sat on the table, its hands trembling between six and six.

She thought she heard Mr. Flores laugh somewhere behind the wall. The sound thinned into the tick of the second hand.

Tamara lay down, unsure whether she was preparing for sleep or waking from it. The clock began to ring again, soft and persistent, as if reminding her of something she’d already done.

She reached out and silenced it.

The room stayed bright for a moment longer than it should have, then dimmed.

The alarm clock rang at six o’clock sharp.
It always did.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I have consumed two black coffees and around a litre of sugar free fruit flavoured mineral water (less than 3kcal). 

My other questions are -

Am I good to do a small workout? Or is that pushing it for my first time? I don't want to eff it up for myself! 

How often should I attempt this for it to be beneficial? I'm a healthy weight and BMI so this is more for detox/overall health than to lose weight.

I’m an academic and writer with a knack for turning aimless walks into adventures, for finding meaning in a piece of abstract art or in a perfectly crafted cocktail. My days are spent between work and words, and my nights are often given to the kind of wandering that makes you fall in love with this city over and over again. I savor long conversations about books and ideas, the kind of talks that stretch late into the evening, lingering like the last sip of something strong.

If you’re someone who finds joy in curiosity and good company—who’s equally happy getting lost in the Met or dissecting the menu of a new speakeasy—then let’s find some inspiration together. Whether it’s a chance meeting over coffee or a day spent gallery hopping, I’d love to share this city with someone who knows how to savor the little things that make it feel infinite.

1ouem5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1ouem5v/get_popcorn_its_story_time/,GET POPCORN!! IT'S STORY TIME,"When I was in first sem I fell in love with a girl let’s say Anushka , she also felt the same way so we clicked and started dating month or two after our college began. After few months due to some of my mistakes our fight started happening very much and it became toxic but I still held on . I knew sooner or later it’s going to end but she did me dirty . There was a guy say him Dhruv he liked her , he barely had any attention in our class . We had a group like me Anushka and our 3 more friends used to be together . We didn’t officially broke up but I knew something was off in second semester she barely talked with me and gave full attention to Dhruv .Next thing happened shocked me to my core . On random day we were attending classes as usual I and Anushka were talking she suddenly asked like “tu mere liye cold coffee nahi laya ab mai baat nhi krungi” context I make best cold coffee so I said “Ohh aapki zindagi mein meri ehumiyat hai “ Boom she idk what happened She took out bunch of painkiller and started eating them one by one I stopped her she didn’t listen I said to her friend to stop her she didn’t listen to her as well So Dhruv was sitting behind me so I turned to say ask her to stop he overreacted and said “aage dekh mai batata hu tujhe “ then when break happenedI stepped out with steel bottle just in case. Then he abused me nd shit but I stood there bc idk why this Bhadwa was overreacting when Anushka start defending her then I came to know they’re dating and I’m chutiya thinking yeh to meri hai

Our relationship was kinda public even class noticed how I distanced and they used to make fun of me resulting severe depression and my health declined and grade as well

No revenge is best revenge they say ? I say give them taste of their own medicine

So I pulled a historic move to move out of embarrassment and get my revenge

When I joined my branch after being common in first year I noticed their was anti ragging committee and how that was a criminal offence to tag someone I waited 6 months to set traps right .

My branch had 5 people who were member of anti ragging in 3rd sem I made friends with them close to gain enough trust and One junior of mine who was quite good but I used him as a perfect bait .

Now times set pieces are where they’re supposed to be.

Now execution of plan I started roaming around classes if theirs and when I see her I make awful faces to her by this time Ik what that girl will do he’ll tell Dhruv as usual I did this intentionally so that he gets provoked

2nd part of plan I slowly said infront of him , yk he’s a good man he’ll accept that girl even if she had sex with other guy last year and he loves . That was the bomb he trusted her gf so he turned angry towards me and I somehow managed to get out of there but IK I was lowkey in danger as he had most of gunde friends so I wanted to pick at them as well . He called and abused me as normal so I rage baited him so hard to say I’ll fight you in campus he fell for it .

Next day all of the people including girl was there to see me get beaten up if my plan went wrong ik I’ll be in heaven for sure . Now I brought 5 1st year 1st sem kids with me who trusted me enough and when we reached to them my junior stood and just said “Chal has time pass my kr to those guys” boom they started beating them UP.

Plot twist :It was all plan since 3rd sem I also called my anti ragging community friends so that they can watch live senior beating juniors I tried to stop fight so that I look as saviour and then guess what? Anti ragging community reported to Director and juniors filed complaint against them and due to strict rules of UGC and college 14 guys including Dhruv was terminated from the college after 2 weeks BOOOM!!!

Their letter and names became so famous that every guy knew what he’s done to juniors and yeah about the girl she stood clueless what just happened lol . One of the junior guys were son of our regional head and held strong political power they fucked them so well that I didn’t had to do anything . And yeah few people who knew about my plan covered my loopholes making them directly linked to juniors somehow .

I met Anushka and I was like bitch you get what you deserve now my whole college knows whose GF she’s and my bro Dhruv 💀 When she confessed yes she did with me and she hid from him he said her the R word straight to her . I got to know that from mutuals from their group

Now my soul feels satisfied, don’t worry about juniors they had minor injury that’s it . That was my story

Never ever let anyone tell you what you deserve and what you don’t If you have to go against the world go against it

I’m in my 3 rd year now and those dumbfucks are not getting admission in college and the girl She went back to hometown due to criticism she faced TBH she deserved it I go college with joy and feel light hearted now

TLDR: It all comes around circles dawg

I like nature/outdoors, listening to music, watching romantic films (and older movies and shows that remind me of my childhood). I think its important to not take the little things in life for granted. I look forward to getting to know every person that I meet, you never know who they are and what they may have been through. A genuine connection really allows to you get to know an individual on such an intimate level, and this is what I am in search for.

Night routine: Ganon pa rin po. Eskinol, moisturizer, and kojic now. 

Main concerns: Any recommendations po para mawala po yung tigyawat niya kasi parang nasa loob po problema. Nakabukol po kasi yung nga redness na nasa picture and kapag matutuyo naman nag black siya na parang pasa. Ewan ko rin po kung sira na skin barrier ko ano.

Lifestyle: Lately, nahihilig po sa sweets and maasim na chichirya and 3 in 1 coffee. Nasa BPO industry po ako now (graveyard shift)

So for context my partner always asks me to pick everything from what we eat and what we do every day of the week. Sometimes I dread days we have off because of it. It’s honestly exhausting. So that being said for the last month or so I’ve been telling them I don’t want to choose what I want to do on my birthday I just want them to plan the day out it didn’t have to be anything crazy. 

Now it’s my birthday the day started out bad. I told my partner I wanted to go get a coffee (a freebie) after I got ready it’s about 10 am at this point I woke up around 8 am, my partner is still asleep and tells me to go by myself because they still have to get ready. So I go by myself, I come back my partner is still showering and when they get out I ask about what we’re doing for the day. My partner asks me what I feel like doing… at this point I’m upset. We go to eat lunch which I picked the place.. we get back home and they go lay in bed and doom scroll for about 30 minutes until I ask for the keys to go shopping by myself. I ask if they want to join and my partner says no and stays in bed. So I go shopping by myself and when I get home my partner is sleeping it’s about 6 pm at this point. My family cooked dinner for me and it was ready at 7 so we go eat. We get home after dinner and my partner asks what I want to do with the rest of my birthday… I just went to bed and cried myself to sleep.

1ouee7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ouee7z/faster_ketosis_cancer/,Faster Ketosis + Cancer,"I fell into keto long before it was cool... back in 2016, because of a Stage 3 cancer diagnosis. There wasn’t much info out there then. Now there’s so much that half of it just muddies the water.

For me, keto has always been pretty simple: about 80% fat, 15% protein, and 5% carbs. When I’m dialed in, my joints are better, my brain feels steadier, and I just feel better generally.

These days I track light ketosis with a glucose under 80 mg/dL and ketones above 0.5 mmol/L. What I’ve been experimenting with lately is how to *get there faster* after an overnight fast. I usually stop eating after dinner, sleep on it, and hit about a 12-hour fast by morning. With a couple tweaks, I’ve been able to slip into ketosis in about 2 to 4 hours after waking.

Here’s what’s worked:

**1. Caprylic Acid (C8)**  
I came across a 2020 Frontiers in Nutrition paper showing that 20 g of caprylic acid can bump ketones to around 0.6 mmol/L in two hours, even with glucose still in the high 80s. I tried it and had almost the same numbers. Pretty wild for something you can grab online for cheap.

**2. Berberine**  
With a bioavailable form of berberine (berbelite), two capsules got me to about 0.5 mmol/L ketones and glucose around 82 mg/dL in roughly three hours. I’ve repeated it enough times that I trust the pattern.

If anyone’s experimenting with getting into ketosis faster, these two have been the biggest needle-movers for me.

**A few practical keto tips that have helped me over the years:**

• Get a meter that checks both glucose and ketones. I use the Precision Xtra and buy the strips on eBay to keep the cost down.  
• Don’t trust “keto” labels blindly. I still aim for the classic macro split.  
• If weight loss is your goal, calories still matter. If the scale is dropping without a calorie deficit, it’s usually water.  
• Electrolytes are not optional. I go heavy on water plus sodium, magnesium, and potassium. LMNT packets have been clutch for me, but plain Real Salt and bulk magnesium/potassium work too.  
• Olive oil and coconut oil are your workhorses. Coconut oil handles heat well, and olive oil is perfect for loading up homemade dressings.  
• My usual rotation looks like:  
– Breakfast: coffee and a Fast Bar  
– Mid-day: 8 olives or 8 macadamias  
– Lunch: veggie soup with almond crackers  
– Dinner: a salad drowned (in a good way) in homemade dressing

Not saying this is *the* way, but it’s what’s kept me consistent, especially when life gets busy. Happy to answer questions if anyone’s playing with similar hacks.",11,1762879471.0,keto,6,0.77,False

**Labyrinth Arc** = Kyara could track and survey Kaji without kaji or The MPD realising (Deception)|Kyara reasoned that The MPD firstly take biological materials and build a record for crime on a victim and then employed Kakerou to take away a victims Alibi after they win a gamble a,they then frame the victim for a crime which the actual culprit paid them for,from Kaji being picked by an MPD official after a lady said kaji groped her and then was taken to a place with Kakerou officials,kaji was later declared guilty for a crime (Thinking,Reasoning)|Kyara was able to motivate kaji using reverse manipulation which made kaji reason about the tracking device in the bandage (Manipulation,EU)|Kyara was able to perceive the minutest body language details on Karl (who kaji couldn’t read) making him reason he was afraid and from what (EP,Thinking,Reasoning)|Kyara could conceal his own presence from Billy Craig while detecting Billy’s (EP,EM,EE)|Kyara used a scheme In which he firstly wounded Billy and Jouichi showing himself as the strongest to make them act against him to act defeated making them overextended which he would use to heavily wound both (Scheming,Thinking,Reasoning,Manipulation,Deception, Crystallised Intelligence,Bodily Kinetic Intelligenc EQ)|During the fight Kyara was reliving the experience of Baku saying that being strong isn’t a,ways the bets trait (PSI,VSI,WMI)|Kyara rested at Yakou’s restaurant as he knew nobody would attack due to Kakerou’s affiliations and Yakou’s reputation (SU,Thinking,Reasoning)|Kyara anticipated Marco would defeat Minowa Seiichi despite Minowa being of a reputation as unbeatable due to beating Bai Long (Foresight,Thinking)|Kyara reasoned Marco is stronger than his alternate personality Rodem and has more talent despite common consensus (Thinking,Reasoning)|Kyara was willing to call Yakou’s coffe terrible (EM,EE,Crystallised Intelligence )|Kyara was able to make a such a great coffee that even after kaji added soil into it it was decent (Crystallised Intelligence)|Kyara was willing to help Kaji after kaji defeated him in the coffee making contest despite going against his nature as the strongest (EM,EE)|

**Protoporos and Before** = Kyara could escape an encounter with Namirbone for months (Adaptability)|Kyara knew The Saftey Guaremtee from Kakerou could be a trap but gambled on it not beng as his intuition told him it wasn’t (Intuition,Thinking,Reasoning,EM,EE)|Baku tasked Kyara with defeating Lalo’s Ally which Kyara accepted without fear (EM,EE)|Kyara could mind read that Robert K really wanted to kill him (EP,EU)|Kyara was so talented that Vincent Lalo found him beautiful like a diamond (SS,Crystallised Intelligence)|Kyara defeated Robert K while beating specific hunters to make Baku earn as much as possible without anyone realising it(Deception,Manipulation,Scheminh,Crystallised Intelligence,Bodily Kinetic Intelligence)|Kyara understood that Baku wasn’t satisfied without eating (EU)|Kyara could defeat hundreds of People in “Teoshi Sumo” without making anyone feel hopeless in their chances to beta him (Bodily Kinetic Intelligence,Manipulation)|Kyara arranged for several outcasts to notice the pickled plum boxes to have them come to him being greedy which he used to make them reveal the power structure (Thinking,Reasoning,Scheming,EU)|Kyara reasoned that those outcasts surrounding him  were of a lower and tasked as front line search groups by upper ranks to avoid danger of Outxast Hunters,he defated the upper ranks and made the lower ranks use the bait to bring more outcasts here (SU,Thinking,Reasoning,Manipulation,Scheming)|Kyara defeated the militants (Bodily Kinetic Intelligence)|As Kyara planned eventually one of his underlings reported that they have made contact with the concealers as they wanted to meet the dominator of the militants  (Scheming,Manipulation)|Kyara attacked Jongkyo but stopped centimetres away as it was a test (Scheming)|Kyara was wounded by Jonglyo bit managed his emotions stopping the bleeding without touching it and asked if Jongkyo was comforted by his doctrine (EM,Manipulation,Scheming)|Kyara remembered who Bandai was and informed Ying of him (WMI,Scheming)|Kyara drank the poison without fear (EM)|Kyara aimed for Jonglyo’s nose while letting jonglyo attack him and also distracting him using the light of the moon,and also aimed at launching the antidote to the side,Kyara allowed jonglyo to overstrain himself to throw Kyara off the Cliff only to com back and start,Kyara used that opportunity he created to fight jonglyo on the cliff side and strain jonglyo further by making him make superhuman moves and force him to discern between hundreds of pieces of rubble as to whether they were the antidote,and even allowed jonglyo to take the antidote and try to move away to attack from a blindspot and have jonglyo spit out the antidote,Kyara used this strain and fixation on the antidote (born out of Kyara’s manipulation of him to amplify thinking this was his destiny (EQ,Thinking,Reasoning,Manipulation,Deception,Scheming)|During the ending of the battle Kyara visualised Baku thinking how he just wants to make Baku win (VSI,PSI,Metacognition)|Ying defeated Banda eventually ,partially due to the information Kyara gave her (SE)|Kyara moved towards a tree and rested ,seein his past versions (Metacognition,PSI,VSI,WMI)|

This can also been seen as Kyara relieving his life and accepting everything that has happened due to the symbolism 

**Referee Mini Battle** = Every Referee considered Kyara the most fit to referee Baku and Hal’s match and would have accepted him as Referee despite that costing them the ability to watch the match or ever be The Royal Attendant (SS)|

KYARA IS ALSO DUE TO THIS NARRATIVE SUPERIOR TO EVERY OTHER REFEREE IN EVERY CAT

We don't need much, we normally just stay in Bungalows - but in 2022 most of the time we just paid like 700 TBH per night and this was the maximum. Now for the same kind of Bungalow we have to pay like 2.500 TBH (Yes, we are looking on Agoda). Is this just a Koh Lanta thing or are the prices nowadays just crazy?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Toronto Raptors vs. Brooklyn Nets: A Tale of Two Teams (One Is Terrible)**

The Toronto Raptors (5-5) and Brooklyn Nets (1-9) are set to collide on November 11, 2025, in what promises to be a game so lopsided, the Nets might as well hand the Raptors a participation trophy and a free coffee. Let’s break down why this matchup is a statistical snoozer, a medical marvel, and a comedy of errors—all while keeping our wits sharp and our sarcasm sharper.

---

### Parse the Odds: Why the Raptors Are the Obvious Choice

The Raptors are favored by **9.5 points (-118)**, a spread that screams “we’re not even trying to trick you.” Implied probability? A cool **53.5% chance to win**, which sounds modest until you realize the Nets are scoring **110 points per game** and allowing **125.5**. That’s like showing up to a bakery and accidentally running a fire drill—everyone loses, but the fire department gets a workout.

Key stats:

* **Raptors’ offense** (119.3 PPG) vs. **Nets’ defense** (125.5 PPG allowed): A mismatch so stark, it’s like a vegan at a steakhouse.
* **Quickley’s stat line** (6.3 APG, 4.4 RPG): He’s a Swiss Army knife in a kitchen that forgot to bring knives.
* **Nets’ 3-point shooting**: They make 13.9 threes per game (10th in the NBA) but hit just 33% of them (5th-worst). It’s the basketball equivalent of writing a novel in invisible ink.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Home Streaks, and the Curse of Cam Thomas

The Nets are currently missing **Cam Thomas** (hamstring), the team’s only player who hasn’t looked like a sleep-deprived intern. Without him, Brooklyn’s offense is a car with no wheels and a gas tank full of glitter. Also questionable: **Day’Ron Sharpe** (hamstring) and **Haywood Highsmith** (knee). The Raptors? Their only injury concern is **Sandro Mamukelashvili** (neck), who’s listed as “questionable” but will probably play just to mock Brooklyn’s depth chart.

Historically, the Raptors own the Nets **64-52** in 116 meetings, including a 3-1 sweep last season. The Nets are also on

1oue1eg,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1oue1eg/first_time_home_setup_5000/,First Time Home Setup [$5000],"# My History with Coffee

Looking to dive into the world of espresso at home, after years of contemplation. I used to get a little nerdy with pour-over coffee, back when I had a Chemex and a coffee grinder, but then my Chemex broke and I gave my grinder to my sister.

I kind of became a coffee normie after that. I just had a hand-me-down Keurig for a couple years since I was a bachelor living on my own in a small apartment. Then I got married, and my wife moved in with me. I started doing the mesh cups and buying nicer coffees from the grocery store. Then I bought a Keurig with a coffee pot since that was quicker than doing pods for both my wife and I in the morning.

Now, I'm still rocking the coffee pot, but I've moved up to buying fresh coffee from Trade (pre-ground because I still don't have a grinder).

What got me back on the espresso train was my brother-in-law getting his own machine. I have someone that I can have nerdy conversations with now, so I think it's finally time to pull the trigger.

# Setup Considerations

For starters, I will be keeping our Keurig. I suspect that will still be our coffee maker through the week. Eventually, I would like to upgrade it to something else, like a Chemex, but in some shape or form, I still intend to do pour-over coffee.

My budget maximum is $5000, but if that's overkill for my use-case, I'm totally willing to go lower.

**The Grinder**

In my research, I think the general consensus is that getting a good grinder is the most important thing when it comes to espresso, outside of having good coffee. I had a bot assist me in research, and I have boiled it down to a couple options:

1. Baratza Encore ESP Pro - Solid beginner grinder with good customer service (at least in the US).
2. MiiCoffee DF64 Gen 2 - Good single-dose espresso grinder with good customer service. Not really designed for pour-over but can achieve good results.
3. Timemore Sculptor 078S - Good single-dose espresso grinder and is the most 'premium'. Not really designed for pour-over but can achieve good results.

If you think I'm sleeping on some other grinders, please let me know.

**The Espresso Machine**

Here is where I'm really torn...

Typically, I'm not someone that goes for the 'beginner' options. I like to have something that gives me plenty of ceiling to work with before I have to consider purchasing something better. That being said, I also don't want to talk myself into a super-expensive machine from the beginning if I can't fully utilize it, or simply don't want to due to the amount of work/cost involved. Maybe I'm overthinking it?

Anyway, here were some options I'm considering:

*Beginner/Enthusiast-Level (<$1500)*

1. Breville Bambino Plus
2. Gaggia Classic Evo Pro
3. Profitec GO
4. Rancilio Silvia
5. ECM Casa V

*Prosumer-Level (<$4000)*

1. Lelit Bianca
2. ECM Synchronika II
3. Profitec Drive
4. Profitec Pro 700

**Accessories**

This is where I'm totally clueless. I see a lot of fancy gadgets for spreading espresso on social media. Not sure how necessary those are? I probably want these:

1. Knockbox
2. Coffee scale
3. Espresso cups

Anything else?

Thank you in advance for anyone that takes the time to help me out. And if you have any methods for convincing your spouse that all these purchases are worth it, that would help too ;)",0,1762878671.0,espresso,2,0.5,False

Maybe the mortgage is eating you alive. Maybe the house needs more repairs than you can afford. Maybe you inherited something you don’t want, or just need out fast.

Maybe, you've been Googling things like:

* ""sell my house fast Dallas""
* ""how to sell a house that needs repairs in Texas""
* ""can I sell my house as-is Dallas""
* ""is it better to list or sell to a cash buyer""
* ""we buy houses reviews Dallas""
* ""how long does it take to sell a house in Dallas""

These searches are common — and valid. They all point to the same goal: getting out from under a property without losing your sanity or your shirt.

Whatever the reason, you’re not alone, and this post is exactly what you’re looking for. It’s written by someone who actually works with multiple real estate professionals here in DFW, not a bot or some national chain pretending to understand your neighborhood.

This is a real guide to what it actually takes to sell your house fast in Dallas — whether you list it, sell to an investor, or find another path forward.

Let’s lay it all out.

# How to Honestly Evaluate Your Home vs. the Dallas Market

Take a deep breath and get honest with yourself about where your property stands compared to others on the [Dallas-Fort Worth real estate market](https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/). Look at pre-owned homes near you that sold recently. Check out the nearby new builds. Odds are, those houses have updated kitchens, fresh paint, clean inspections, and zero major surprises.

If your house has peeling paint, foundation issues, unfinished work, outdated everything, or unpermitted additions, it’s not going to fetch top retail value. That doesn’t mean you’re stuck — it just means you need a plan that matches your situation.

Plenty of real estate professionals in Dallas — whether realtors, investors, or loan officers — have firsthand insight into how to evaluate your home’s value in today’s market. If you know someone personally, take them out for a coffee and ask if they’ll walk you through it. Many agents will gladly run comps and give you a quick look at similar homes using MLS access.

If you don’t know anyone you trust or can’t find someone willing to help without a fee, you can also request a **free home valuation report** from Dallas Homes for Cash | Sell My House Fast Dallas by calling us or [submitting your property on our website](https://www.dallashomesforcash.com/). No strings — just solid info to help you understand what your house might realistically sell for.

# Should You Sell With a Realtor If You Need to Sell Fast?

If you’ve got time, money, and patience, listing your home the traditional way could be your best shot at getting top dollar. Selling to a retail buyer — someone who plans to live in the house, not flip it or rent it — almost always results in the highest purchase price.

That said, this route comes with expectations. Retail buyers are usually families or individuals comparing your house to others in the neighborhood. If your home isn’t clean, functional, and appealing, they’ll move on to one that is. Most are financing the purchase through a lender, which means the house has to pass inspection and appraise correctly.

You can absolutely work with a real estate agent to list your home, and if your property is in good shape and you’re not on a tight timeline, it could be the smartest move. Just understand that most agents will recommend repairs, deep cleaning, staging, or even small renovations to make the property market-ready. You’ll also have to allow for showings, sometimes on short notice, and deal with potential buyer fallout during inspection or loan approval.

And remember, when the deal finally closes, you’ll still be paying out 6 percent commission plus closing costs — which often brings your final number down by 8 to 10 percent.

Want the Highest Offer? A Retail Buyer Is Your Best Bet

But only if your house can stand next to others on the market and make buyers say yes to living in it for the next 5, 10, or 30 years. That’s the bar — and it’s high for a reason.

# Creative Options to Avoid Selling Under Pressure

Before jumping to listing or selling to an investor, take a moment to ask if there’s another creative route that fits your situation better. These options won’t work for everyone, but for some, they’re the best middle ground between full-price and full-exit.

**Option: Rent it out (even temporarily)**  
If the property is livable — even barely — you might be able to rent it out short-term or mid-term to cover the mortgage while you regroup. Dallas has pockets with strong rental demand, and you’d be surprised how many travel nurses, contractors, or students look for short leases. It’s not a forever solution, but it might buy you 3 to 6 months of breathing room.

**Option: Seller financing or a subject-to sale**  
These are advanced strategies, but the right investor might be able to take over your mortgage payments (a subject-to deal) or pay you over time (seller financing) if you own it free and clear. This avoids a fire-sale and still gets you moving forward — especially if you have little or no equity but a decent loan in place.

**Option: Talk to your lender**  
If you’re behind on payments or headed that way, you may still have time to apply for a forbearance, deferment, or loan modification. It’s not a guaranteed fix, but in some cases it buys time to make a cleaner decision later. Just don’t wait until they post a foreclosure notice — by then, your options shrink fast.

**Option: Partial rehab and list**  
If you can afford some repairs but not everything, talk to an agent or investor about what the bare minimum looks like to get a listing live. Sometimes $3k in work gets you $15k more on market — but only if it’s targeted and strategic. You don’t need granite counters to sell a house. You just need it clean, functional, and safe.

# ""We Buy Houses"" Companies and What You Should Know About Selling to a Cash Buyer in Dallas

Now we get to the part everyone warns you about — the “we buy houses” signs on telephone poles, the wholesalers who ghost you, the companies that offer big at first and then gut-punch you at closing.

A lot of the horror stories are real. Some wholesalers will:

* Lock up your house with no intention (or ability) to actually buy it
* Try to assign the contract to someone else at your expense
* Promise one thing, then renegotiate last-minute when you're desperate

So yeah — be cautious. Vet anyone you deal with. Google them. Are they willing to show their face on social media? Ask what their exit strategy is. Ask if they’re actually buying or just wholesaling.

# Why Dallas Homes for Cash | Sell My House Fast Dallas Is Worth Talking To

This is the only company we’re naming here — not because we’re the only option, but because this subreddit is built to be transparent and actually helpful, and we stand behind what we do.

[Dallas Homes for Cash | Sell My House Fast Dallas](https://www.dallashomesforcash.com/) is a real, local team that buys houses directly. No fake offers. No disappearing acts. We underwrite deals in-house, close with a Dallas title company, and give honest offers based on real numbers — not tricks.

If your house makes sense for us, we’ll give you a straight cash offer — no repairs, no fees, and you pick the move-out date.

If your house doesn’t make sense for us, we’ll still help you understand your best next step — even if it means listing, renting, or holding a bit longer.

# Get Clear on Your Timeline and Priorities

Ask yourself:

* Do I need to sell in 7 to 14 days?
* Am I okay walking away with less if it means zero repairs and zero stress?
* Would I rather take a little more time and possibly make a bit more, even if it means showing the house and waiting on a bank?

Once you know your answer, the right path becomes clearer.

# Compare Multiple Offers (And Watch for Red Flags 🚩)

We don’t expect you to take the first offer you get — and honestly, you shouldn’t.

Talk to at least 2 or 3 buyers, ask good questions, and see who follows through.

If you want us to take a look at your house, we can usually get you an offer within 24 hours. No pressure. Just numbers.

Just send a message right here on Reddit, get to know us on [our Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dallashomesforcash), or visit [our website](https://www.dallashomesforcash.com/) and we’ll walk you through it.

# Common Pitfalls That Cost Homeowners Thousands

* Waiting too long Hoping for a market rebound or better offer when the house keeps getting worse only leads to more carrying costs and stress.
* Getting emotionally attached to a price Just because your neighbor sold for $350k doesn’t mean your unrenovated house is worth the same. The market doesn’t care about potential — it cares about condition and comps.
* Only talking to one buyer or one agent You wouldn’t take the first job offer you ever got without comparing. Don’t do it with your house.

# Final Thoughts: You’re Not Alone

Dallas is full of people going through tough transitions. Divorce, job loss, inheritance, burnout — we’ve seen it all. You’re not a failure for needing a faster, simpler way out.

Use this subreddit to ask questions, post your situation, or even just vent. You’re in the right place now, and you’ve got options.

We’ll keep this post pinned here at the top as a go-to guide for anyone looking to sell a house fast in Dallas. Hope it helps.

Veterans Day, celebrated on November 11th, is a time when the nation honors and thanks those who have served in the military. Many restaurants and businesses across the country recognize this important day by offering complimentary meals and special discounts exclusively to veterans and active-duty military members. This year, numerous establishments are providing generous free meals to show their appreciation for military service.

# How to Take Advantage of Free Veterans Day Meals

Most restaurants offering free meals require valid proof of military service. Acceptable documentation typically includes a military ID card, a DD 214 discharge certificate, or proof through services like ID.me. Some establishments also accept those in full military uniform. It's always wise to **call ahead** to your preferred restaurant to confirm they are participating, verify specific menu options, and ensure you meet all eligibility requirements. Many deals are only available for **dine-in customers**, so takeout or delivery may not qualify.

I will still get some stuff done. But likely start a bit later. I might get some of my nesting things done. I am just curled up in a pregnancy pillow and it feels good. 

Mom said she will make something special for breakfast as we are not time bound. Pesarettu?  Idk. At this point I just appreciate someone is making me breakfast. I will eat anything edible. 

Husband is working from home. Poor thing has been driving me around for work so much. He needs a break too. 

Speaking of husband….. 

Yesterday he said something, unexpected 🤣. That made me laugh so hard lol! 

I didn’t realize it had gotten so late after we met for coffee and it is just me, I never send people home hungry if they have met me. Fill their bellies with whatever I have, and then send them home. It is how I work. Even when people come to any party I host, I might miss the mark on decor, or aesthetics, but I always feed people and send them home with some extra food. Even if they come at 4 pm, they atleast get a cup of coffee or tea with some snacks. Filling bellies on time is my utmost priority. 

It is an Indian thing I guess? Idk. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

Anyways, I saw the time. It was late. And ofcourse this weird obsession to feed him kicked in. My feet were fucking swollen from sitting in that hard ass chair. 🪑 

Anyways I took him home and fed him. Food was okay… but it was food. It is nourishing. 

I was mostly concerned to reduce the swelling of my feet and just introduced him to my husband. And kept keeping track of how my feet were doing. I wasn’t even paying attention to their conversation. 

He ate. He left…. 

And then I napped for a bit and rested…. Got the swelling down. And then did some PT exercises for my PAINFUL 😣 pelvic girdle pain. And soon it was night and we slept. We never got a chance to speak of the meeting a lot. I gave him a sort of “summary” but that is it. 

On our way back from work yesterday when he picked me up, he just out of the blue said “I never expected him to be good looking..“ 

I raised my eyebrows…. “… good…. Looking?” 

“Yeah, he is quite a charming young man. I really enjoyed conversation with him. He seems… nice!” 

I was snorting at this point…

He was like “what?” 

“Nothing, I just was not expecting this conversation” 🤣 

He rolled his eyes and then got a bit serious and said “I know you think something is off between him and his wife. I really hope he doesn’t feel like he is not good enough for a happy relationship. He is good looking, seems like a decent guy, seems responsible, has a decent job, there are not a lot of men like him…. I hope he realizes that.” 

I did agree with him. Then I joked if he was gay for him because he has never voluntarily described a man “good looking” our whole relationship to which he shook his head laughing 🤣. 

Anyways, it was really funny. I don’t know his opinion on my husband. And with the “backstory” I know, it makes it 10x more funnier. 🤭",1,1762878296.0,u_fancypantsmiss,0,1.0,False

I love gifting, it's my primary love language, so I got creative and gave my giftee a coffee table book (which I already owned), some fancy biscuits and fancy coffee, all wrapped in a patterned tote bag (which I already owned). Came in to like £9.50 but if I'd bought the book and bag brand new it probably would've been closer to £40.

This year I'm planning to make my colleague a personalised journal in a secondhand ring-bound filofax thing (I've found them for about £5), and in the ""wallet"" bit I'm going to add some stickers, a bookmark, pen, teabag, etc. 

I've designed and printed the inserts myself, I was going to make the bookmark and the other bits will probably eat up the remaining budget.

Again if I'd bought all of this brand new instead of thrifting or making things it'd be way over budget and I was just thinking is this okay or does it undermine the ""spirit"" of having a low budget? No one else at my workplace is really crafty or thrifty so most of the other gifts are like.. a book or a t shirt or a mug and a pack of sweets etc. which are all lovely and clearly within the budget.

Me [M25] just asked a girl out for the very first time in my life. Same age lang kami, previous coworkers and current friends for over a year. I’m a really introverted person, but I get talkative when I’m comfortable with the people around me. We never really had a thing, pero dati shiniship lang kami, and I started having feelings for her during her last few months in our company. I waited before asking her out kasi I wanted to be sure that I actually liked her not just because people were teasing us.

For the past couple of months, we’ve been talking on and off. I really enjoy spending time just talking about random things, even useless stuff and rants. Pero I’ve never really gone deep into asking what she likes or doesn’t like — yung usual na nakikita mo sa movies when someone likes somebody.

Recently, it’s been bugging me. I’ve been watching videos about love like, “Do I really like this person or am I just horny?” But I realized I genuinely like her and want to build something more than friendship.

So I confessed through IG and asked here for a coffee date (takot ako if I ask her in person), and I don’t like talking over the phone kasi I get super nervous. It’s been 3 days since I sent the message. I added a message saying she can take her time to respond or just say no outright I’d rather know if she’s interested or not. But now it’s really weighing on my mind since she hasn’t seen or responded yet.

Do I follow up, wait, or just let it go? I’m scared if she says no, but also scared if she says yes. I’m the type of person who’s happy just by you joining or being w/ me, so now I keep thinking what if she says yes? Ano naman pag-uusapan namin sa date? Sayangin ko lang ba oras niya?

He asked if the coffee was free and if the meal came with hash browns and I told him not to worry about it.

I spent an hour and a half talking to Mr. Brown about his time in the Air Force, how thankful he was to the VA for making sure he got his cancer treatments, even though he has to pay back a debt from not reporting that his wife passed last year. He is proud of his service and just wanted to feel a sense of brotherhood again and all it cost me was 5 dollars and a little of my time. I gave him some money for bus fare and asked about his living situation and he'd told me not to worry about it because the shelter was open day round because of the season and he's going to be in transient housing soon.
