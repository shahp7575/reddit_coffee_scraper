1jsp99u,https://i.redd.it/po26c2dma6te1.jpeg,Army Field - Am I the only one who ‘dreads’ them?,"Question, and for context I’m a choco, fairly new to the army game, and late 40’s.

Am I the only one who ‘winces’ whenever one of the bosses talks about the next field exercise? I’m really trying to ‘embrace the suck,’ but I’ll be honest, it’s a struggle. I don’t find it’s what we do during the day that is painful, even though physically it may be, whether it’s patrolling or whatever, it’s ‘fine,’ some parts are reasonably enjoyable, but that’s about it. Maybe it’s because I’m a bit older, and whilst walking around with guns can be fun, it doesn’t make me want to go and ‘knock one off’ under my hootchie or something, like it does for some of the younger blokes. 

It’s the nighttime activities which induces ‘dark thoughts’ in me (no pun intended). I was out field last night, lying under my hootchie, being ravaged by a squadron of mozzies, my cams saturated in sweat and dirt. Eventually I gave up trying to swat the mozzies away, and just let them get stuck in. They must be the most well fed mozzies on any army training area, they’ll have to go to Weight Watchers this week to have any prospect of getting airborne again. Anyway, as I lay there covered in filth, trying to think ‘positive thoughts’ and convince myself I would look back on this experience with ‘fond memories,’ the dreaded piquet list came out. The plan was, were going to have to do two, two hour piquets overnight, leaving approximately nine minutes for sleep. With this breaking news, in a similar fashion to Shakespeare’s King Lear, I had a critical moment of ‘anagnorisis’ and thought ‘what the fuck am I doing here?’ Fortuitously, a short time later, we got bumped by enemy party, as a result of which they changed the piquet times to one, one hour piquet. I never thought I’d be so pleased to hear that I’d be getting up halfway through the night, to be ‘feasted on’ by mosquitoes, and stare at a tree in the dark for an hour whilst trying to get support elements, who were probably enjoying a glorious unfettered sleep in their ‘lux’ swags, to respond to my sit-rep report on the radio.

So this is a long winded way of asking, does anyone else feel the same way about field? I’ve really tried to approach ‘field’ with a positive mindset, hoping that if I tell myself enough I’m enjoying it, I will. I’ve even taken the advice of fellow ‘digs’ who have ‘waxed lyrical’ about the luxurious sensory experience of climbing into a fresh set of cams to sleep in at night. I tried this last night. After ten minutes of ‘f-ing and blinding,’ trying to extract my cams from my rucksack in the dark, pissing off my oppo who was trying to get his nine minute sleep in, and then attempting to ‘wrestle them on’ whilst lying under the hootchie, I was lathered in sweat, as were my cams, and so I was pretty much back to square one from a comfort perspective.

I have identified some positives to going field, it makes my full time job seem easy, I get to sit at a desk, in the aircon, and drink coffee whilst pretending to work. Also, for some bizarre reason, I have no appetite whilst out field. Whether it’s stress, or the prospect of plastic cheese on a cracker, I literally only ate a ‘steak bar’ whilst on my recent two night field ex. So I’m getting for free, where many celebrities are paying large sums of cash for in weight loss drugs like Ozempic.

As I said, my field experience is restricted to a couple of nights, so I ‘tip my hat’ to you ARA digs, who experience lengthy sentences of ‘field.’ On that note, what is the longest, most miserable field experience you have had?

I think a possible solution to my predicament, is either ‘harden up’ (unlikely). Or, I could corps transfer to a non combat core, so I can be the non responsive dig on the end of the radio, in a deep, glorious sleep in my ‘lux’ Kings swag (with mosquito netting).

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Alright, folks, gather 'round for the La Liga showdown that promises to be as thrilling as watching paint dry: Real Valladolid vs. Getafe. It's the kind of match that makes you wish you had a dentist appointment instead. But hey, we're here for the love of the game, right?

Let's dive into the stats and odds, shall we? Valladolid, bless their hearts, are clinging to their La Liga status like a cat to a curtain. With one foot already in the Segunda Division, they're desperate for a win. Meanwhile, Getafe is eyeing a spot in Europe, probably thinking, ""Hey, if we can't beat Valladolid, we might as well start planning our summer vacations.""

The odds are as juicy as a lemon: Getafe is favored at around 2.05, while Valladolid is priced at a generous 4.5. A draw sits at 3.0, which seems like a fair bet considering both teams might just decide to call it a day and share the spoils.

Here's my best bet: Take Getafe to win at 2.05. Why? Because Valladolid's situation is as desperate as a reality TV contestant's quest for fame. Plus, Getafe has everything to play for and should be able to navigate the Zorrilla stadium without too much drama.

So, grab your popcorn, or maybe a strong cup of coffee, and enjoy the spectacle. Or, you know, just check the score later. Either way, Getafe should come out on top, leaving Valladolid to ponder their future in the Segunda.

What I want to share is for all the people who are as confused as me and are feeling alone, unloved, and not enough (spoiler, you are always enough).

My piece of writing is definitely hectic, with some grammar mistakes (hey English is not my first language), and probably silly. In any case, I feel much more relaxed after acknowledging everything that happened and could've, but didn't.

I would appreciate a view from the outside on this.

After moving to another country, having a lot of acquaintances around, people that you thought you connected and became friends with, only for them to turn your back to your side when you needed support, I understood that you just have to accept that it's really not only about you. They are just not your people.

I thought and maybe I really felt in love at the first sight. I was trying to control my feelings, it worked out somehow. I was the one who followed first and reached out. He invited me for coffee. Our date was the day before I turned 20. I felt like we connected. He was such a polite, gentle, and accurate person, in my perception. Even considering that we didn't get to know eachother better, I still think about him this way.

We talked about movies, music.. just matched on a lot of things. About family, shared stories, the discussion was going smoothly. I felt like I had known this person for a long time. We saw eachother randomly half a year ago. He opened the door for me, I just remembered his face then, and thought ""what an interesting looking man, well dressed"". Well, I moved on with my life. Later, during a chat he mentioned that he also rememberes opening the door for me.

After months, we met at an event. This is when my heart went into crazy mode, and my mind was obsessed. After the date on the next day, he wished me then happy birthday. I wrote first in a couple of days. Our communication seemed strange. He was answering in a polite way, in 10 minutes, a couple of hours or a day, then suddenly didn't respond.

I made cookies for him (he mentioned that he likes them), genuinely hoping it might lead to us spending more time together. He seemed a bit surprised, but I didn’t expect anything in return. Later, we randomly met and had a brief interaction. He said the cookies were amazing. At that moment, I thought it might be fate trying to bring us closer, but in hindsight, I see it was just me reading into things too much.

Yesterday, I was drunk (never ever do or say something serious in such states), and guess what? I messaged, asking how is he doing and that I kind of missed talking to him.

He responded after a couple of hours, saying accurately, that he is seeing someone and is sorry for giving me the wrong impression. I felt that it'll turn out like this. I expected something about him being busy, the age gap, just a ""this wouldn't work out"". Knowing there is someone else there, made me feel that I wasn't chosen. Again. For the third time. This time hurt the most, because of the date I felt a least a bit of reciprocation. Anyway, I wished him all the best.

I'm still feeling hurt, but I do understand that I missed a couple of things. The lack of action, and initiative from him. My need for feeling validation and being seen. The expectations at a very early stage, when there was nothing, but the perspective in the air.

Love will come into YOUR life. But it doesn't mean it'll be in the form you expect. Don't make expectations, try to calm down and see the reality. Focus on yourself, not only on your feelings and perceptions, but also on how you are treated and approached. Maybe, I just didn't experience real love. But for a short moment while talking to him, I felt something very peaceful, and inexplicable inside. I was happy that day, and it'll remain a good memory. 

I tend to believe everything that happens in our life has a reason and a lesson. I feel better in a strange way, and I am thankful for this experience. It made me come down to earth and realise that feelings are not only about me and what I want.

I wish I could've been friends with him, but I don't want to be around. It's enough that we have common acquaintances. At least now, we didn't unfollowed eachother. I'd be happy to see that he's happy. And now after an intense time of gathering my life around a future fantasy, I will try to truly focus on myself.

Now the body was decent with some sweetness coupled with a bright acidity but that other acidity/sensation on the finish just ruined the whole damn thing. The acidity lingered in the mouth for minutes after a sip.

Now before you say it's under/poorly extracted etc hear me out. I tried brewing this at different ratios 1:16, 1:17, and 1:18 all with a scale and brew print. Tried 3 grinders (2 flat, 1 conical) 2 brewers (v60 and chemex). Drawdown times were aimed for 3 mins for v60 and 4 mins for Chemex. Experimented with grind size, h20 temp and agitation but still could not shake the vomit taste on the finish.... Anyone else have a similar experience with them or this particular seasonal coffee from them? Is this a result of poorly inner bean development on the roast or lack of Maillard reactions? Should I have a longer draw down time?",1,1743925651.0,pourover,0,0.67,False
1jsouit,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1jsouit/fell_for_someone_i_shouldnt_have/,Fell for someone I shouldn’t have,"TLDR: recently started liking a colleague of two years, for whom I never had any prior interest, but we started getting friendlier than usual, she invites me over for dinner, the next day I try invite her to grab coffee after work but she rejects politely. I’ve decided to not take this any further unless she makes a move, where my sanity says this was all a mistake to begin with as I was just taking it in the wrong way, but I can’t get this gut feeling out that she might just like me. 

So here’s the thing. 2025 was going great. Made amazing memories and started taking my passion projects seriously. But then this happened. 

A colleague of two years, she’s the sweetest person I’ve met, but never had any major feelings for her, well actually none, I was actually repelled at the thought of her being my partner or some shit like that. But since last year I kept getting this gut feeling “why is she behaving like this?”, is she trying to drop hints or something? I just discarded those thoughts blaming myself for overthinking. Somehow we started connecting more outside office, but just surface level. 

I don’t know if this is true, but is it correct that if someone has liking towards you, they will mimic your subtle behavior or some shit, mirroring? Or is it just red pill jargon? Why I say this because she mimics a lot of my behaviors and body language when we are sitting together in various contexts, it is definitely an overthinking pattern of behavior from my end. But it freaks me out when someone does this. Anyways this paragraph is just an overthinking disposition. 

But I just wanna keep this short. We had a company outing and we had some engaging deep conversations, I mean she randomly started filling in personal details of her life. So since we are Indians, at age 27M and 25F, we start getting family pressure of marriage, and for ladies it’s even worse. But she never mentioned whether her family is making her talk to another guy, as every time I talk about this topic the only she has to add that she doesn’t have the energy to talk to someone at this age as she is too frightened due to rise of adultery in marriages and what they just end up fighting with each other, just like her parents. I am not gonna lie but situation is also similar for me, we share similar traumas. Apart from we kept engaging throughout. Before this she had mentioned multiple times to go out and try some street foods, I’ve always said passively yes. After the company outing, I thought to test the waters, and I took initiative to pitch this plan of her, to her itself. Due to some logistical issues, it was not possible, but she invited me over dinner instead. We had a great time, where for some reason she was mildly interested to know when my breakup was, and she started talking about her last breakup and relationship. Anyways fast forward, as day after I asked whether she would be interested in grabbing coffee after office to check out the new cafe that opened. She immediately darts me with the question whether I am causally asking or am I asking her out on a date? Since she is my colleague I wanted to keep this as neutral as possible , and said that I just liked hanging out with her and nothing else, to which she replied she appreciates the invite but doesn’t think it would appropriate. Okay, I became super anxious whether I just offended my long time colleague. Over the last week I realised she has been acting normal as usual towards me, but I don’t know man. 

I can’t get this feeling out of my head towards her. Why did I walk into this in the first place? Part of me feels that I might have burned the bridge of friendship instead, even though she’s working up to be super friendly. Then I came to  know she’s going through arranged marriage process in the early stages. 

In general she would always share random eye contact with from across the room anywhere and to try to mimic my behavior, for example like I have this very specific sigh that I do when I am nervous in a situation, and it’s very unique to me, like a sigh that ends with me doing shallow beat boxing, how tf do I explain, like *sighhhh-cha-ch-cha-chacha* or some shit, I am also a musician so beats always go through my mind, and I was also doing this a lot when she invited me over dinner. She does the exact sigh at office when she’s sitting next to me 😭 why do I over read shit like this? But I also find it weird when someone mimics me like that unconsciously like bro, why tf am I on your mind so much that you remember such details about me? It’s not just that, she even mimics my dialogue patterns and words that I use at the end of the sentences? Can’t be fucking coincidence right? But she only does this when she’s in a conversation with me. In general her outlook towards me is that she would always praise my outside office activities (like she is only my IG and she knows and remembers what I posted like 3 months back like wtf) to my other colleagues, even though she is more introverted than me. 

You can roast as much you want. I know I overthink, like a lot, but if you find what I said to make even a slightest bit of sense do let me know in the comments. But in general I’ve never lately thought of someone so much in a span of week. I just probably would need therapy for this patterns of thought process. But I have ended up in a situation where I have decided not peruse this further unless and until she tries to initiate anything further. I don’t want to assume, my wishful thinking gaslights me that she is probably conflicted in perusing me due to family restrictions. But fuck it I am done.

1jsosez,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1jsosez/earthquake_cockroaches_fractured_arm_and_coding/,"Earthquake, cockroaches, fractured arm and coding - the story of how we launched our first Steam demo last weekend.","*Hi, I'm Jerzy. One half of Clumsy Bear Studio. We are 2 idiots who decided to take all their savings and put into the idea of making a ""real game"". This is a story about last weekend and how we tried to launch our first Steam demo. As it will become very obvious when you read it, I have zero writing skills! but I thought I would share it anyway.*

# It was the most intense weekend of my life yet. It involved my partner Scott and me trying to finish the demo for Hungry Horrors and push it live on Steam, an earthquake, multiple flat moves, and cockroaches.

For a few months now, we’ve been living in South East Asia, working on our game while travelling. We decided to do so as our game is self-funded from our savings, and despite trying to live on a budget, London prices were melting our game budget insanely quickly. We didn’t want to give up on this dream because we spent all our money on grocery shopping, so we decided to move to South East Asia. This was something we had done before when I ran an augmented reality studio before the pandemic ended that adventure.

We have a 6-month digital nomad visa, a pricey but great flat in Bangkok with an amazing rooftop swimming pool. And we worked on the game. We got invited to the London Games Festival and decided that this was a great deadline and moment to premiere our demo on Steam. The demo was almost ready, just a few last touches.

The plan was simple: we’d push the last changes by Friday, do a day of testing and a soft launch of the demo, catch any bigger bugs, and fix them before the big marketing push on the 2nd and the festival on the 3rd of April. I would fly to London on 31st March, and Scott was staying in Thailand as his family was coming for a holiday and to visit him. We knew it would be an intense couple of weeks, but we were ready to tackle the challenge and hopefully rest afterwards.

On Friday morning, we were pushing the last updates to the demo. The plan was to commit changes and test a lot on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Steam Deck. Around midday, all changes were made and, before testing and committing to Steam, we decided to go for lunch.

Scott jumped in the shower and I was consolidating feedback from the last Itch version. I was sitting on the computer chair, writing, and first felt like a swing. I thought the chair was wobbly again, as I’d had that issue before. I tried to move it to see if it happened again, but it was stable. Then I felt a second swing. That was worrying. I thought maybe I was losing my balance. It felt like I had just got off a ship and had sea legs. I was worried something was happening to me, so I rushed towards the bathroom to tell Scott, in case it was just me. Then another shake happened. This time the whole flat shook slightly. That was confusing. It felt like an earthquake, but Bangkok doesn’t get earthquakes. I shouted for Scott to get out of the shower. He left and just put his shirt on, and the flat shook again. I grabbed my wallet and door key, which were in front of me, and shouted at Scott to get out of the building.

We didn’t know what was happening. Maybe there had been some kind of explosion. The walls and ceiling started cracking. We got to the evacuation stairs and started running. We were on the 10th floor, which in Thailand is high. We didn’t see or hear anyone, which was very odd, but we were running quickly yet steadily, trying not to break our legs or something. The stairs started cracking. Maybe it was some kind of pipe explosion, because Bangkok doesn’t get earthquakes.

We managed to get down and out from the back entrance. There was a lot of water falling down from the building. We saw a woman running towards us with a small child who was crying, shouting ""What is happening?"" We didn’t know. We got to the car park exit, but it had a massive gate and a lock we couldn’t break. We were still very close to our building, with walls too tall to jump over. The water was pouring down, and it was not safe, as we were directly under a massive balcony with an infinity swimming pool on the 41st floor, which was literally above us. I shouted to everyone to run to the other side of the building, where there was an open area towards the street and fewer skyscrapers. We got there, all wet, and saw the whole street of people running out from skyscrapers.

I remembered that not far from us, there was a flat area where there used to be parking, so we ran there to have some empty space and not be directly under tall buildings.

There were a lot of people there from a nearby hotel. One woman brought Scott a towel to cover himself, as he was still just in shorts. I sat down on the ground to calm my legs, and I felt another shake. I wasn’t sure if it was me because nobody else seemed to notice. I heard squeaking. There was a tiny rodent-like creature, like a gopher, held by a half-naked man in a towel. Also, a few dogs barking. A group of confused, barely dressed people and animals.

It looked like everything had calmed down. Actually, it looked like nothing had happened on the ground. Except for scared people everywhere, there were no signs of an earthquake. Street bins intact, not even fallen. Plant pots: fine. Windows: fine. Motorbikes: parked and untouched. So what was it? A gas leak? Bangkok doesn’t have earthquakes, so what could it be?

All I had grabbed was the key and wallet. No phone, no laptop, no way to communicate or check what was going on. But then we heard some people talking about an earthquake and showing each other videos on their phones. OK, if it was an earthquake, that means aftershocks, which can often cause the collapse of already weakened buildings. We didn’t feel safe there. Luckily, I quickly remembered that just a block away, there was an area with multiple low-rise hypermarkets and massive parking lots. Lots of flat areas with no high buildings nearby.

We quickly passed through massive traffic and walked towards one of the shops. I saw a woman inside trying to secure clothes racks in case of another shake. I got in and quickly bought a T-shirt for Scott. Outside the shop, the staff were handing out water bottles, pastries, and snacks. They had set up parasols for people to hide in the shade. That was really nice of them. The whole thing was a bit surreal. So many literally shaken people, some sitting on the ground crying, some walking around in bathrobes, pyjamas, or just shorts, most glued to their phones watching a flood of TikToks from the area. Some behaved like nothing had happened, just going about their day and clearly annoyed that some shops weren’t open. Like two different realities had suddenly merged together.

Because I’d picked up my wallet at the last moment, we were able to buy stuff. I popped into a nearby café to get some sandwiches, coffee, and water, but we stayed outside, avoiding the rooftops. Once we calmed down a bit and ate, I remembered we had passed this very old internet café. I only remembered it because it was very dim, dark, empty and looked sad, compared to the massive, multistorey, bright, loud, and colourful gaming cafés in Da Nang or Chiang Mai. It was in a relatively low-rise area and only about a 30-minute walk away, so we decided to go there. We managed to get internet and contacted our families. We weren’t able to log into most apps, as they all now require two-factor authentication through a phone or an authenticator app, which is completely useless when you don’t have a phone. We couldn’t even contact our landlord to say we were OK, or ask what we could do next.

By this time, it looked like everything had calmed down, so we decided to go back near our building and find out what was happening. We got there around 5ish, and staff told us technicians and management were in the building checking if it was safe to go back. Within two hours, they said it was all safe, and we could go back in and pick up our stuff. I went up with a few other people via the fire escape, and it was an interesting view. Water was pouring down the stairs. Some floors looked almost fine, with just a few cracks on the walls, while others were much more damaged, with broken tiles, cracked walls and ceilings. It was a bit scary, constantly thinking it might shake again.

When I got up to the 10th floor, unfortunately, the fire escape door was shut. It looked like the earthquake had destroyed the door frame slightly, and the door was completely jammed. So I went down and talked to the staff. They asked us to wait as they were sending a technician to open the door. An hour later, we were told all doors were open, so I went up again, still locked. I tried the 11th floor and tried to get in via a separate fire exit, but everywhere was the same. I went downstairs and spoke to the staff again. It looked like they were now making a list of floors that were still locked. An hour later, they said floor 10 was open, so I went upstairs, still jammed, no way to open it without tools.

Not going to lie; at this point, I was sweating, tired and really not happy. I went downstairs again and then overheard a staff member telling another tenant that technicians were on their way. So had anyone actually been opening the doors? Had anyone even checked the building? I wasn’t sure I could believe they had done that so quickly. Surely, it takes time to evaluate whether the building structure is intact and safe to go in, especially in a place where earthquakes don’t usually happen. So we waited longer and were finally told the 10th floor was open now. I went up again, and it was still locked.

I was so angry at this point, but then spoke to some people walking down (bless anyone who lived on floors like 30 to 45, I don’t know how they managed), and they told me there was a guy with a crowbar on the 16th floor opening jammed doors. So I found him and was finally able to get to our floor and into the flat to get our phones, laptops, some clothes and essentials.

Once downstairs, I started searching for a place to stay. It was 11pm and understandably everything was gone, and what was left was insanely expensive. We’re on a tight indie dev budget. Finally, I found a place in a nice flat area and we were so happy that this was the end of the drama.

But it wasn’t. It was just part one.

We got ourselves a couple of beers and snacks and took an extremely long taxi ride to the hotel. Bangkok was paralysed with traffic, as the metro lines obviously weren’t working. Finally, we got to the hotel, and on the spot,t I realised I had booked the wrong dates. I think the system didn’t allow me to book for the previous day because it was after midnight when I pressed the booking button. But they had a spare room, so we were able to stay. We got to the room, which was nice and spacious, a bit old-school but fine, until I went to the bathroom and saw small roaches running around. I also noticed them around the fridge. But we couldn’t move anymore. We were too tired and really just needed a nap to figure out what to do next.

We decided to go to sleep. The bedroom looked cockroach-free, and we would move out the next day. I called my parents to tell them more details while Scott went to shower, and then suddenly, I heard a noise and a scream. Scott had tried to avoid a cockroach while showering, but slipped and hit his hand. He said he was in a lot of pain, more than just from a small fall. So we started looking online to figure out whether it was broken, but everything we read seemed to suggest it wasn’t. Good job we had those beers, we put the cans in the freezer and used them as ice packs. We decided to go to sleep and see how he was during the night. We didn’t sleep much, still feeling wobbly from the earthquake, Scott being in massive pain, and being aware of cockroaches. I found some small eggs or droppings in the corner of the bathroom and didn’t even want to know what made them.

Around 6 am, Scott said the pain wasn’t going away and was still really bad. So we went to the hospital. We had been to this building before to get a prescription, and they have an amazing food court. Not just for a hospital, but in general. Multiple different cuisines and really good food, including fusion dishes like bao with green chicken curry. So we were excited that at least we would have a nice breakfast. It took until midday for Scott to be discharged with a fractured arm and a cast on his hand. There are still more tests to be done, but we got our food, so we were happy.

I started looking for another apartment, as we couldn’t stay in that hotel. I found an Airbnb in a perfect location and a quiet area we actually had wanted to live in originally. We were excited, finally, after 36 hours, I would be able to lie down, relax, chill out and gather my thoughts. We got to the apartment around 3 pm, and as soon as I opened the door,r I saw a dead cockroach, this time a massive one. I hoped it was just one, but then I opened the bathroom door and found two more. In the bedroom, more again. Around the fridge, even more. I was so upset and exhausted at this point. This place had great reviews online and looked safe. We were so tired and still had no place to stay for the night.

Luckily, the landlord was very nice about it. He was very apologetic and immediately gave us our money back. He was clearly in shock. Maybe cockroaches came out during the earthquake and then ate poison and died, but we didn’t want to test how many there were or whether any were still alive, crawling around at night.

We went to the nearest café to charge our phones and find another place. Meanwhile, we were trying to figure out what to do next, as our original landlord told us that management said the building was fine to live in and we could go back. I had been there and taken pictures. The flat had cracks all over. Nobody had yet been into the flat to check if it was safe. We are definitely not going to live in that flat.

After a very long search, I finally found a hotel that looked relatively new (hopefully no roaches) and flat (safer in case of aftershocks), and we got there late in the evening. The hotel was nice and clean and the staff were very helpful. So immediately after inspection, we decided to extend our stay for a week. And back to the Hungry Horrors demo, as this was what we were supposed to be doing 25 hours ago. The last thing Scott had implemented was small changes to Steam Cloud and mouse-only controls. I was supposed to be working on social media and website copy for the demo release and everything else for the London Games Festival.

But we found bugs. This time not cockroaches, but in the game.

We had had enough. We were literally about to quit it all. But we went to sleep and hoped we would feel better the next day.

On Sunday morning, we woke up and re-evaluated the situation. It was 8 am. In 24 hours I was flying by myself to London, leaving Scott behind with a fractured hand. I only had summer tropical outfits with me, and all of them were still in the old flat. On top of that, my legs were in pain. I could feel every muscle like a heavy brick. That was the result of running up and down to the 10th floor multiple times. It was the biggest workout my legs had had in ages. My walk was so bad for the next few days that people were moving out of my way to make room, as I appeared to have impaired mobility.

We decided to try to do it all on the same day. I went shopping, barely able to walk, and also went to collect all our belongings from the old flat. Scott worked on fixing bugs with his dominant arm in a cast. Both tasks took longer than expected. It was hard for him to even use the mouse with that hand, and I was moving much slower than I wanted. It took ages to pack. We had also rented monitors and computer chairs for work, so we had to move them to the hotel’s storage. It all took until late evening.

Around 7pm we were testing the game again. Some small bugs, some missing content, but it was in relatively good shape. Around 10pm we were done. I decided to do one more test while recording gameplay to share, and after an hour and a half of playing the demo, it happened. The princess couldn’t move. Her body was in two positions at once. This was a game-breaking bug.

We had to get the demo out on Sunday. I was flying all day Monday. Tuesday was April Fools, so the release could easily be taken as a joke. And on 2nd April we had planned a big marketing push to get the word out. The demo had to go live before that to make sure it was working properly on Steam.

It was really frustrating, mostly because we weren’t sure what had happened. I had been recording the session, and we could see the bug had occurred once I picked up a silver ingredient. But I had done that about five times earlier with no issue. So I took the laptop and tried to replicate it, replaying the same level over and over again. Suddenly, it happened while I was playing the game from Godot, and Scott was able to figure it out. It was a combination of me pressing everything very quickly and opening a chest while picking up ingredients next to it so fast that animations played at the same time, breaking the game.

Scott was able to fix it, and we moved on. At 2 am, we did one last test and got ready to upload. Finally, just after 2am on Sunday, we pushed the demo live. I had 3 hours left of sleep.

I’m writing this all from a hotel in London just after the London Game Festival Expo. I think one day I will write a part 2; I'd love first to know if it all led to massive success or failure, but currently, the jury is out!

They come in 20 minutes late with their drive-thru lunches and starbucks coffees, a sign that they were definitely concerned about being on time, then spend 10 minutes chatting elsewhere instead of hearing the shift rundown and taking the floor. And when you show up 10 minutes early that night (like usual, like a normal person), they are practically out the door before you've said hello. 40 minutes before the actual, scheduled end of their shift. They leave their shift reports undone, paperwork lying about, cabinets open, computers logged in, equipment strewn about, and a cloud of dust behind them... zyoooooom!

I’ve done a fair bit of thinking over the past months, and I realised I’ve mostly been living life on autopilot. Get up, work late, cook, eat, read or game, and repeat. When family or coworkers ask me what I’ve been up to, I don't really have anything to share.  I have always been a bit of an introverted loner, but these last few months have made me realise that I am no longer just mostly alone, but that I’m actually lonely.







I’m hoping this post here can be a bit of a kick-start to my social life. I’m not picky about how, whether it be real-life friends, virtual friends, texting buddies; I’m open for pretty much anything! I want to get off that autopilot life, so I’m looking for someone to share my thoughts and experiences with, and who wants to share their thoughts and experiences with me. Let’s ask each other meaningful or meaningless questions. Let’s talk about random crap, or about important things. Let’s share our life experiences, our passions, or what we’re having for dinner. Let’s share photo’s of the world around us, and about our place in that world. I like to think of myself as curious, open-minded and inclusive, so please, broaden my horizons!







You don’t have to be into the same stuff as me, but I’ll share a bit about myself just so that you know who you’d be talking to. I used to prefer coffee over tea, but am slowly starting to prefer tea. I thoroughly enjoy living in a city, but my ideal vacation is travelling to remote places and spending my days hiking or biking. I prefer paperbacks over hardcover books. I love muddling around in the kitchen. I own more watches than any sane person should. I’m a former fit person who got fat, and is trying (but so far failing) to get fit again.







I have struggled massively with my mental health, and even though things are much better now, I continue to be in therapy. I’m just sharing this because I think it’s good to acknowledge the things I struggle with, and to show that I’m open-minded concerning personal battles.

So the other day I was trying to figure out where to stay for an upcoming Europe trip we're doing, and everyone here was really helpful with helping me find places to look, but because it was very general questions there was only so much advice people could give me. I had a look at some Airbnbs that might suit our party (5 adults) and thought I'd post them here so people can make suggestions on what they think would be the place area for us to stay in, so with that, here are some options that I've found that I think might be good:

1. [Beautiful Picpus Apartment](https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/987118322117073225)
2. [Quiet apartment in the 16th arrondissement](https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/1226132186465708600)
3. [Charming house with garden](https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/1234591013042542255)
4. [Pretty Parisian house, Garden, Porte de Montreuil](https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/28810628)
5. [Luxurious apartment - 3BR/6P - Nation](https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/1057106565671702874)

We're looking at going to places like Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Montparnasse Tower, as well as possibly things like Notre Dame, and maybe a museum like the Lourve or Orsay. We'd also love to do some kind of picnic but that should be easy enough to find a place to go to (though if anyone has any suggestions, I'd gladly take those too!) We'd ideally like to be within 20-30 minutes to most things by public transport if we can - no point spending too much time on public transport if we can avoid it, though if one or two things are a little further away that's not too bad then - we don't mind spending a bit longer for a couple of things. Also we'd like to be close to some restaurants, food places, shops/groceries and maybe some cafes to grab a coffee during the day.

I'm not 100% sure if I was looking at the right things but from what I could tell, most of these options could be good for public transport, though it was a little confusing - some places I saw listed said the Eiffel Tower was 25 minutes away by public transport, but when I looked it up, the site I found said it was 40 minutes away? Makes me think maybe I was looking at the wrong place perhaps, so I'm very happy to be told otherwise. Also if these aren't in great areas to stay in, I'm also happy to look for others if that's what people suggest

i was lucky to find some of my best friends by knocking on the doors of my freshman year dorm + joining club sports and clubs that don't require you to apply. i would recommend looking for those types of clubs and engaging in the community or finding jobs on campus (Believe it or not BAP and kerk coffee house have some of the strongest friend groups on campus).

there are tons of organizations on campus and ways to make it feel smaller on campus. i can share more organizations if people would like each quarter and i hope you all start to feel better :)

also remember that transferring is an option. you can transfer to a CC or a different college. if you feel like this isn't for you, it might be worth trying other options than ranting on reddit.

Long time lurker and very thankful for everyone to share their stories, which have been extremely helpful when dealing with my own issues. It's sunday morning, the sun is shining, I am having a cup of great coffee and ready to go the gym with my wife. Last night our oldest son (17 YO) was having his friends over - they were drinking responsively, none were wasted or severely inebriated. Also kudos for choosing the right wine glasses to match their ""choice"" of wine. They stayed up late, cleaned up after themselves, and I woke up to a clean living room and feeling very grateful. 

Of course I did not share my own experience with alcohol with them, but I was happy to see my son and his friends (really nice people) have a cozy evening without drama. I didn't feel any jealousy as I'm super happy being sober. In case they would have asked for advice, then I would have told them as I wrote in the subject line: ""the only positive thing that alcohol can bring is forgotten memories""

  
None of the ""memories"" that I created when I was young and partying were real - or at least I don't remember any of them.

1jsodc3,https://i.redd.it/iulvd7z3s5te1.png,ChatGPT guided me through electronic board repair.,"**I don't know a whole lot about electronics. I don't know how electronic components affect other electronic components. But, I'm not completely clueless.  Without ChatGPT there is no way I would have been able to fix this laptop motherboard. Thanks ChatGPT.**  

  
For those curious about the situation:

  
My brother had this Alienware laptop that he spilled coffee on almost 10 years ago.  It let the smoke out and wouldn't turn on.   I tried to fix it at the time but was absolutely clueless.  He gave it to me and its been collecting dust ever since.  So I decided to take a crack at it again, but this time with some guidance.

I tried this two times with chatGPT.. The first time I just jumped right in, but ChatGPT was forgetting present tense information which was causing the conversation to go around in circles.   So I made a new chat and  told it to add everything I said to its memory.  I then gave it all of the known facts such as; What was wrong with it, the component names and ID's I was focused on, how they were connected, voltage readings, part numbers etc.  And from there ChatGPT guided me on what to do next. 

Although it wasn't perfect. ChatGPT would sometimes say dumbass things.  For instance, I told it that there was no power anywhere on the board when the AC adapter was plugged in, and then it wanted me to check what the voltage was on a particular IC chip that I had already said wasn't being powered.  It did this quite a few times. Annoying AF. In its defense, I'm using the free version. 

In the end, all I had to do was desolder a resistor that isolated a voltage divider from an IC chip controlling the gate of a power mosfet.  The resistors values of the voltage divider were not what was on the schematic, so it threw everything out of whack. ",3,1743923284.0,ChatGPT,1,1.0,False

According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.

I assume an appropriate approach is a combination of:

Plato (cave metaphor)

Leibniz (monads/units of consciousness)

Spinoza (substance monism)

Bohm (holographic universe)

Pribram (holographic brain)

Koestler (holons)

Tom Campbell (virtual reality/units of consciousness)

The holons (Koestler) may provide the link between physics and personality/identity. They may be what Seth coined the \`gestalts´.

Seth differentiates between units of consciousness (CUs) and electromagnetic energy units (EEUs). Every gestalt, i.e. ANY gestalt is a conglomerate of CUs in non-physical reality. These CUs \`come together´ to form physical matter - as EEUs -  in \`our reality´. When they form physical matter as EEUs they operate as particles. When they operate in non-physical reality, they operate as waves, possessing wave characteristics. The CUs are the tiniest building blocks. They are infinitesimal small, but each one is endowed with the full creative power of All-that-is. They are transformed into EEUs once they physicalize/are physicalized. From the moment of physicalization/particle-ization on they begin producing subatomic particles (upwards). Thus, everything is made of CUs/EEUs, non-physical and in wave-form outside of our physicality (CUs), and as particles and EEUs in 3d. We all exist as interconnected wave forms outside of physical reality made up of CUs, and we exist as a conglomerate of EEUs in particle-ized form inside physical reality. After death we continue to exist as a gestalt, but we exist as a wave form. CUs form gestalts. Once a gestalt is formed (particle, atom, molecule, cell, organ, being, etc. it never ever vanishes. And it can never become less than it once was (Seth). A gestalt, once formed, never ceases to exist.",0,1743923187.0,spirituality,0,0.5,False

the literal first episode we listened to was about some kid who needed 4 hip surgeries in his 20s and how doctors couldn’t figure it out, he had to look at his bloodwork himself and realize he had low alkaline phosphatase and that’s why his bones were deteriorating. i screamed bc i have had low alkaline phosphatase in my bloodwork since i was 16 but no doctor ever commented on it and i never inquired. so i think that plus my left side feeling weird and then feeling so cold and my body temperature was 96.8 so i took a hot shower which helped a little. i just wanna go to sleep.


i had such a good day and ending it like this sucks. and why can’t i find a good doctor on zocdoc, i don’t wanna call places!!!  i cannot live with this medical anxiety anymore. i need to figure out if anything is actually wrong with me. i’m constantly thinking i’m gonna drop dead or stop breathing. in the last year my grandpa randomly died from a possible heart attack, then my mom needed an emergency appendectomy that went a little wrong and she was in the hospital for a month, then my grandma was in the hospital for multiple complications regarding kidneys etc until she died a few weeks ago. i am going to assume this has all contributed to my health anxiety even if itsaid circumstances don’t seem to directly upset me. maybe i need to go on anxiety meds again, i don’t know.

Miso soup: I soak about 15g of dried kombu in 400ml of water overnight. The next morning as I start to heat up the liquid, I freshly shave 10g of katsuobushi. One the liquid starts heating up, I remove the kombu, and once boiling I add the katsuobushi shavings and kill the heat. I let it steep for 10 minutes, I drain the liquid, and now I have dashi!

I add ~10ml of sake, half a tsp of dried wakame, and... I dunno how much, but a semi small amount of cubed silken tofu to the dashi. I bring to a light boil, at which point I take out a ladle of the dashi and add to 35g of white miso paste, whisk to combine, and keep that aside while the soup very lightly simmers till I'm ready to serve. To serve, I kill the heat, add the miso slurry, then serve immediately.

Natto rice: thaw natto pack overnight. The next morning, wash 1cup Japanese rice, soak the rice in water for 20 minutes, drain, add kosher salt, 10g kombu, then 1/3cup sake and 2/3 cup water. Bring rice to a boil, turn the heat to lowest possible for 5 minutes, then highest heat for 1 minute, then kill the heat and leave in pot for 10 minutes to steam. (I do not believe in rice cookers unless you're a restaurant, but that's me.)

Mix the natto with mustard and tare, fry an egg over easy in vegetable oil and sesame oil, put half the rice in a bowl, add natto, and add fried egg. Pepper on egg.

I cut up 2 stalks of green onions, and add to both bowls.

With a cup of coffee, this is probably my favorite breakfast ever.",6,1743923009.0,JapaneseFood,0,0.88,False

I added more details .

Please read till the end to understand it fully . 

I'm writing summary here. ( India) 

My bf ( m 22)  and I( f 22) were in relationship for more than a year . I was very  toxic while he had anger issues and started being emotionally abusive at the end of relationship.

Him and I share a romantic connecton back when we were 16 but never committed or more . 
4 yrs of no contact due to family reasons . 

Met again. And got into relationship.
I slept with a guy in that time , went on different dates or whatever things I did intimate , bad , good everything. . I told him honestly everything and asked if he is still ok to start a relationship to which he said yes . It was long distance relationship so I keep on comparing teasing or making him jealous ( that's why I said I was toxic )  for a good amount of time without realising . Whatever.  

But later he said I humiliated him took stand for others made him insecure and cheated on him .( In the no contact period as we had a connection and love that I ruined ) He said so .

I understand his jealousy and insecurity 
But after realisation I did everything to make him feel good but everything I did was somehow never enough .

He would interrogate and ask every single detail for hours and would be mad either I lied or said the truth 

He had very strong anger issues and panic attacks . He told me there is some other personality and he want me and him to save from them . 
He don't have much time left and that i gave him trauma 
Also that if I break up or suicide his other personality ( AB ) will hurt everyone including himself . 

He came in dec 2024 to meet me during my final exams . I asked him not to buy he didn't listen . 

Then in dec 2024  ,night before my last  final exam 
he forced sex on me . 
He got extremely triggered as he interrogated mein person said he won't use protection bcs my ex used and when I insist he got very angry . Like very . 
( I told my ex to stop and he did and didn't go further) 

He was so angry that I obligated . I feel stuck freeze and unsure . I don't feel anything or pain 

My hand was twisting and so was my knee so I asked him to stop 4 times . He didn't
At the fourth time he got extremely angry holding my wrists , I started crying but he screamed if i cry he will be more angry .  
And then he felt guilty later
I don't remember what happend for another 4-5 mins. 
Whatever 
His reasoning later was my ex stopped so at that time his ego got so much that he was like ""usne Kiya toh muje bhi Krna hai "" and he is now guilty 
I felt deeply hurt betrayed and scared . 

 I had to write internship report all night , awake hungry hurt and crying while being in a dangerous place . 

We get intimate the next pr the day after that 

I went home 
Brushed it under the rug but 

started having nighmares and as I was reading our old chat today  I found out 
I used mf word there in my personal diary for him ,
I sent ss of that to him in chat 
He got angry and he's like 
I got angry that day bcs of your past and you write mf word about me in your diary . ( What an a*) 

He started threatening me on chat and call  almost to not break up with him saying that's his other personality  saying this not him or whatsoever 

And situation escalated 
My family got to know 
I didnt wanted 
but forced by friends and guardian I had to file fIR (court case)   against him for threatening me if I break up . 

He also send **  text to my bestie saying he will make her sex slave and his bf read that 
Although my ex begged me to ask my bestie to block him bcs that's his other personality or whatever . He wanted to save everyone from them 

He did odd jobs to help me financially sometimes or use money on travel as we both live in different states . He walked barefoot on road with wounded feet so I can wear his shoes as mine broke in middle of night . All this amidst heavy rain 
He did a lot 
So did I 
I asked him to take his medicines forcefully as he got sick after he abused me and was very guilty too and said it was in a moment of anger.  
Idk if he was pretending or so I stay or actually sick . He has a history of being sick and fainting . I complied for sex only bcs I felt guilty tripped and he was angry . 
 He did took meds and I was looking after him and myself then . Everything felt like a big nightmare . 


I'm confused 
He felt like a big liar , manipulative , gaslighting and asshole but 
Other time he felt like the most caring supportive person I know . He did a lot for me 
But am I characterless ? And that 
Made him a monster ? 

Was my yapping and past a problem 
He couldn't left bcs he had extreme childhood trauma and abandonment issues . 

Sometimes I feel guilty other times I feel disgusted and raged. 

Past 3-4 months my life has fell apart 
Delayed 6 months of graduation ( missed final exam ) 
Sexually abused or raped idk 
Break up with ex 
Ongoing Court case 
On break with bestie ( good terms ) 
Break up with another bestie ( he saved me from suicide ) 
Tried suicide 
No close friends left 
A lot of self harm ( since I was 16 after getting emotionally neglected and betrayed by my guardian who abused my family financially and emotionally) 

Supportive family ( although they stopped talking for a while and somewhere still hurt ) 

It's so difficult to face my family and all ( asian family ) 
Everything feels like a nightmare 

I am so exhausted amidst college , case and family . No matter how much I sleep it's not enough , college is ending , exams are in 20 days , fighting evryone single day . 

I feel disgusted at the moment 
He believed or idk as I'm a whore or whatsoever for being physical with other guy and a girl , going on  coffee dates or kissing someone . Idk .
I slept with that guy to erase his memories we had at 16 and other things . Maybe this triggered . Idk my contradicting lines confusing as he felt I am lying bcs he was angry . I feel I tell him truth or lie mixed . And say weird things as i think of him before that .

I sometimes can't feel my body or cry when I try to insert menstrual cup ( I never used to as i have using it from quite a long time ) . 

He was a good guy , extreme childhood trauma , bad parents ( physically abused him and emotionally and also used him for money ) 
But i don't feel anything for him . Idk I feel good sometimes that he deserve it but at the same I feel guilty too . Bcs the court case can ruin life . 
I never wanted to I was forced to file charges and didn't knew until I was in police station and had no choice . My family said we'll do an agreement on first court hearing as I asked them so and they feel the case is an exaggeration. 

He was very supportive and I was pretty toxic. Also considering that he was physically emotionally abused since he was 7 continuously compared neglected and forced to drop out of school while he was a topper . I felt I triggered him and his anger triggered me.

So did I ruined his life ? Was he a bad person ( he lied things too) . Idk .

1jso541,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diverticulitis/comments/1jso541/appointment_on_monday/,Appointment on Monday,"Hi all,

So for about three weeks I’ve been having some real bad gas and bloating issues. Some days crippling other days not so much. I finally went to the doctor (I know I should have gone sooner), after trying to make some adjustments to my diet. It’s usually pretty clean I just drink copious amounts of coffee. I’ve pretty much quit for the last week or so. Usually relieving some gas has always made it feel a little better but then I have gas again shortly after. Anyway,

My family doctor immediately started calling to make me an appointment saying he wanted to rule out diverticulitis and put me on cip-pro and metronidazole. He made me an appointment for Monday at a GI. My mother in law has diverticulitis and said it sure sounded like that’s what I have and she told me to go on a liquid diet so I’ve been basically just drinking bone broth and a little bit of pbFit because I was starving lol. It’s been 2 days of that, pain is a little less. I was feeling better and ended up eating some chicken and mashed potatoes and now I’m back in slight pain, probably too early?

Symptoms are:
-bloating even without eating 
-gas
-left leg pain 
-slight burning sensation in left groin area 

I haven’t really been constipated, I guess a little less than normal but it’s been okay. 

My questions are, what do yall think? What’s next for me at the GI? I’m just so scared about cancer. Will they be able to tell me Monday which it is?

I have been reading a lot of posts from people having their friend pass away in the last days. Every single time I read one of those posts my heart dropped at the idea that we would, one day, find ourselves in the same situation. 

Before I continue allow me to present Miss Bennet. 
Miss Bennet is a lady who spend the first three years of her life in cage. She was terrorised and would not come out. We bunnysitted her a few days bringing mats and putting ourself to her level in the hope that she would get used to us. 

We agree to take care of for a longer period of time on the condition that we could move the cage to pour place. Thus began us leaving the cage open spending days in a row on the floor from our morning coffees to lunches and dinners including all the moments in between. 
We slowly started feeding her a variety of greens which she had not had before and slowly but surely she started getting used to us and got curious about the life outside of that cage. 
What started with a few hops back and forth quickly ended up in her free roaming our appartement. She NEVER destroyed anything nor even nibbled in a cable. She enjoyed carpets/ mats/ curtains / tunnels … you name it she liked it. 

But Miss bennet had very bad teeth. And thus also followed tummy issues and others. We moved from our appartement into a house ( her house, she freeroamed anywhere and she decided which doors should be open. Spoiler; all doors should be open at all time. 

In the meantime we did manage to find a vet that specialised in bunnies. I did not even know bunny only vets existed to be honnest and I am so grateful for everyone working at that place. 

She underwent a few teeth surgeries amongst others. She survived what our vet assumed was a heart attack from choking after the teethsurgery ( even though we monitored her and shred everything ) 
We got her through a stasis episode that lasted more than three days taking turns monitoring her/ staying hydrated/givings meds and so. 
She got through so many bad episodes and every day we got with her extra since we adopted her was a blessing. 
We got soo much extra time with her thanks to our new vet but it always feels like we did not have enough. Our whole live revolved around her.


Her favourite place was the balance pad of my wife where she would boop my wife off when she was in home office. Truth being told. It was her pad and after buying a second one she also claimed that one. 
She enjoyed running upstairs in the morning and or evening and having zoomies there. We placed as many puzzle mats as we could anywhere so she could have grip and live her best life. 
A short while ago she had rediscovered digging and dug with such attitude only leaving inbetween for the casual nap and snacks. 


There are soo many stories I want to share and I feel like this text does lot represent even one percent of who she was. 
I will miss her love. 
I will miss her smell and how she felt. 
I will miss the sounds she made. 
I will miss her crunching and her stomping. 

I will miss soo many things I can’t even think of one before thinking of another. 

I am destroyed by the loss but we gave her all we had and she did the same in return. 

I felt like I somehow had to write this down here because I rediscovered redit a few months back and I am checking Bunny posts daily sharing knowledge from experiences or learning from others and their long/short eared friends. 

I am also writing this because I hope I get some good reactions that might give my wife a smile while reading them even if just for one second. 

She was a part of us and she always will be. 
This is rough but we will get through this. If you’re reading this and you are also mourning know that I think of you and I send you our thoughts. 


I love you Bunbun you will always be our little princess.

She always would come out of the back room when she saw my truck pull up and talk with me, leaning against the truck while my order was being made. Asking all kinds of questions… being super friendly.. after two months of daily interactions she gives me a business card and was like oh btw I wanted you to have my card and number on it…. Then is all oh and there is a dollar off coupon on the back of you wanted to use it like that. So in my mind I think … wait is she giving me her number or the coupon…. But since I’m unclear I don’t text. A month goes by and we still always talking and friendly . So I finally decide to see if she’s just friendly or interested. I text her and say hey, sorry if this isn’t why you gave me your number, but we seem to get along well and talk all the time. However since it’s your place of work I don’t want to make a scene and ask you out in front of the girls who work with you. So I’m asking you via text. Would you have any interest in us getting to know each other better via texting a bit and maybe go out some time… not only did she leave the text on read. But from that day on she avoided me at the shop. Would walk away when I drove up and she was working the register and just completely ignored me…. I have no idea what how with every sign being there. That instead of saying no sorry I have a bf or sorry that’s not why I have you the number. She would have just ghosted me

Like did I and the several people who at different times would go with me to get coffee really completely read this girl wrong? For weeks they were telling me shoot your shot she’s definitely into you. She doesn’t lean against anyone else vehicles and lean into them or talk to everyone like she does you every time. So I’m just confused at how I read it so wrong… I’m already bad at assuming most girls who talk to me are either just nice and talk or flirt with guys or if they work in service are just being a good worker and trying for a better tip.

1jsnw1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1jsnw1m/otb_chess_difficulty_compared_to_online/,OTB chess difficulty compared to online,"I'm sure this is a topic that has been gone over repeatedly, but I can't find a post that outright answers what I'm curious about, so here we are. Anyhow, I have only been playing since around Oct/Nov of last year, and only play online. I have a board at home but no one that I personally know plays so the only use it gets is me playing myself, and I'm sure that's why I don't quite see the huge change in difficulty between online and OTB, since I don't play other people. At the same time though, it just doesn't seem like there should be that big of a difference, a chess board on my computer screen or on my coffee table is still a chess board. Why is there such a large difference between someone saying they're 2200 rated online as opposed to someone saying they're 2200 OTB? ",1,1743921284.0,chess,4,1.0,False

Sat down and we both ordered a coffee and a cake. Had a good chat and she held baby etc. about 40 mins into seating, I started to breastfeed baby. Coffee was nearly gone but cakes hadn’t been eaten yet. A member of staff came over and demanded I stop feeding my baby as it was ‘too time consuming’ and we’ve been sat here for too long and it was a busy period so we need to leave. We pointed out there were over 10 empty tables and we still had cake but she ignored us and held the door open for us to leave. I was so upset and embarrassed I just stopped feeding baby and rushed out.

whilst reflecting over the weekend I wish I had had said something to her but worried I’ve missed some time frame that Costa allow and overran. Was she right to ask us to leave? Or was she in the wrong

The Warriors have won 11 of their last 12 games against the Rockets – to boot, 10 of those 11 wins were by more than this game’s spread of -4.5. In addition, Golden State has won their last 5 straight outings, pulling off wins against top contenders the Denver Nuggets and the Los Angeles Lakers in the process (also by more than 4.5 points…) With the home advantage and a healthy A-Team, I’m on the Warriors to bag another victory and cover against Houston.

Before the inauguration we (me + 2 other employees + the 2 owners + 4 of their friends, so a lot of people) got together for a ""training day"" with a professional barista instructing us. Everyone else was talking to each other very loudly and hardly paying attention to the instructor, who I noticed was very frustrated about it so I paid extra attention to her because I know how awful that feels.

I thought I did well, I learned everything very quickly and prepared like 10 lattes while my coworkers prepared just 2 each! But two days later I was checking one of my coworker's ig stories and she was posting about a ""tasting session"", everyone was there trying out the menu and I was just finding out about that. I got bummed but oh well guess they just forgot about me.

All that happened a week ago. Yesterday I got a message from my ""boss"" saying, basically, ""you're not communicative enough for a barista, we can try and give you an administrative position we think would suit you better but no promises"".

How was I supposed to know I should've ignored the training part??? I've never been more excited for a job so being left out and then fired before the inauguration made me really sad :(

Also, truth is I am VERY talkative (clearly)! I love having conversations with customers and that's why I choose to work with the public. But, y'know, I didn't think I should be talking while someone was trying to teach me something I was very interesting in learning AND was essential for what my job was. It was just a reminder that the neurotypical world doesn't make sense so it will always be harder for me to navigate it.",15,1743920787.0,AutisticAdults,5,0.9,False

She's a brat, that's our dynamic. She's always up to something to playfully mess with my head, not just with the OCD, but other ways as well. As I let her continue, I started to notice that some things do look better when they're not lined up perfectly. Asymmetricity looks kinda softer, so I let them be the way she left them. I'm not saying I'm cured, but I'm a lot better than for example a few years ago. And I wouldn't have known that, if my girlfriend wouldn't have challenged me.

I’m a bearded and tattooed 39 year old guy that is pretty bored and lonely.  I have a family but I can’t help but feel empty I guess. Let’s fix it.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes work sends me places so maybe we can meet if I end up near you. I play music badly, write songs that I sing over this bad music. Well, kind of growl since I’m a metalhead and singing is silly. Also I can’t sing.

I’m love a good coffee and a recipe. I love sharing both. I enjoy reading probably as much as I do writing, a bit more sometimes. I enjoy a good drink. Scotch is my main one, I am pretty good at making any mixed drink. I love to bartend when people are over.

You? Want to come over for a drink? Not really, an online drink I suppose. Maybe we can talk about the above stuff. Some things I didn’t mention. Let me know you and you know me and we’ll see where it goes.

I got this ad for this novel and it sounds pretty good but the link for the app didn’t work I guess the app is not available in my country or was taken down again. I can’t find it anywhere especially because the title is so basic. It’s about a assistant called Katrina Morgan and her boss (CEO) Kylan Ross it’s called:
Contract Marriage with My CEO Boss
Chapter 1
Katrina Morgan woke to the familiar sounds of sirens and the distant pull of loud city life filling the crowded street below. Rolling over onto her back, she sighed and rubbed the sleep away from her eyes. She felt around in her duvet for her phone, finally finding it after a minute of lazy searching. She checked the time, relieved to see she had actually woken up before her alarm, for once.
She went over the schedule for the day in her head, calculating how much time she had to get ready before her boss’s driver would be pulling up to her building to collect her. Three years into working for Ross Corporations, she still wasn’t used to being picked up for work that way. It was essential, though. With the amount of work her boss had her handle on a daily basis, both of them needed to be driven around. It wasn’t practical for her to have her own car, not in a city like this one.
She stood from her bed, taking a moment to stretch before she stumbled to the blackout curtains covering the massive window on the far wall of her room. She pulled them back, taking in the view from your thirteenth-floor apartment. Regardless of the workload her boss gave her, or how completely impossible he was to work for most of the time, Katrina was always thankful for a view like this one.
With a small smile on her face, she hurried to take a quick shower. As soon as she was done, she wrapped a towel around her body and walked to her closet to choose an outfit. She decided on a black pantsuit, with a white button down, and a pair of red heels. She coupled the outfit with a pair of sheer nylon socks.
As soon as she was dressed, Katrina headed back to her bathroom and applied an appropriate amount of makeup. She curled her hair into loose waves, and then she brushed her teeth. With one more glance at her reflection, she left her bathroom and grabbed her briefcase from atop her dresser.
She finally turned her phone off to silent mode, and it instantly rang. Just like it did every single morning, for the last three years.
“Good morning, Sir,” Katrina said with as much cheerfulness as she could muster on a Wednesday morning.
“I need a new phone,” came the brisk reply from her boss.
She wasn’t at all surprised that he didn’t return her polite sentiment. She sighed, willing herself to remain patient.
“I just bought you a new phone last week, Sir,” she reminded him through mildly clenched teeth.
“What the f*ck does that have to do with anything? I need a new one,” her boss quipped at her impatiently.
She swallowed and pinched the bridge of her nose. He was in one of his moods, it seemed. He was always curt, and always impatient, but every so often, he’d really lay it on thick. On those days, she had no choice but to hold on for dear life and ride the mood swings with as much grace as she could muster.
“There’s a lull in meetings today between twelve and three, I’ll go and get your phone then,” she told the boss while she closed and locked her front door. “Oscar is here. I’ll be at the office shortly with-“
“With my tea, I trust. Make sure they don’t steep it for longer than three minutes this time, Katrina,” her boss interrupted, his voice icy and thin.
Oh, he was really in a mood today. She could handle it just fine. Katrina was more than used to it by now. But she felt bad for any unsuspecting intern that would have the misfortune of crossing paths with her boss today.
It was no secret that the turnover rate at Ross Corporation was remarkably high as of late, especially. Not for the least of the reasons being the boss and his… Well, his complete inability to have a single nice conversation with anyone.
Kylan Ross was, by all accounts, an asshole. A bastard, really. He had gone through fifteen assistants, since the inception of his company seven years ago. Remarkably, she had stuck around, despite his open hostility to almost every single person.
She did everything for him. From his dry cleaning, to balancing his books, to making his appointments and scheduling his doctor’s visits… She was, quite literally, Kylan’s lifeline for most things. It was overwhelming at times, to say the least. But where Kylan intimidated most people, he didn’t bother her as much. Where others got offended when Kylan was practically a robot, with only two emotions in his arsenal: Angry, and angrier; she never took it personally. And Katrina never asked why he was the way he was, either. Though she was half convinced he came out of the womb being eternally grumpy.
Katrina took people for face value, and Kylan was no different. So, while she often had to bite her tongue at the ridiculous requests her boss would throw at her daily, she also knew how to talk to him. She knew how he worked, and she knew where to avoid pushing him, in order to avoid an all-out nuclear level event from happening. Most of the time, anyway. When he was in a more unpredictable mood than most other days, it was a little bit trickier to gauge his next move.
“I’ll make sure. Anything else, Sir?” Katrina asked Kylan, while she opened the front door of her apartment building. She quickly found Oscar, right where he always was. The sleek, black SUV he drove around, was impossible to miss. It stuck out like a sore thumb among the sea of yellow taxis that littered the streets of the city.
“Is the stock meeting with Ryan today, or tomorrow?” Kylan asked with an annoyed sigh.
Katrina climbed into the back seat of the car with a silent thank you to Oscar, and then she moved her phone away from her ear, promptly putting it on speaker. She opened her calendar, so she could look at the schedule.
“It’s today at four o’clock,” she told Kylan, buckling her seat belt, while Oscar did the same in the front seat. He pulled out into traffic and headed in the direction of the coffee shop she went to every morning. It was the one place left on Kylan’s list of shops that didn’t brew his tea “all wrong”. She wasn’t sure what she would do if, and really inevitably when, he deemed this shop unworthy, too.
“Fuck. I’m sick and tired of these weekly meetings,” she heard Kylan grumble through the speaker of her phone.
Since he couldn’t see her doing so, Katrina allowed herself the satisfaction of rolling her eyes at his words. “Sir, you know the stocks have been dropping rapidly over the last few months. We need to come up with a course of action to rectify the situation. The press are-“
“The press? Don’t make me laugh, Katrina. You know I don’t give a shit what the press thinks of me,” Kylan snapped at her.
Katrina bit back a sigh. “I understand that. But while you don’t care what they think of you, that doesn’t mean that the average person echoes your opinion on journalism,” she reminded her boss gently.
Kylan released a string of impressive swear words, and she listened silently. This is how conversations like this always went with him lately, ever since the stocks for Ross Corp. had begun their steady decline. As soon as he was done filling her ear with his favorite vulgarities, he hung up without another word.
She locked her phone and put it in the side pocket of her briefcase. She closed her eyes, rubbing the sides of her forehead, willing herself to find a shred of patience to make it through the day ahead of her.
“You should get an extra shot of espresso in your coffee,” Oscar suggested with a friendly glance at her in the rearview mirror of the car.
Katrina laughed without any humor. “I don’t think that’ll be enough today, Oscar,” she admitted with a shake of her head.
Oscar nodded sympathetically, and a few minutes later, he pulled over to a curb near the coffee shop. She got out of the car and walked inside. She ordered her usual, foregoing the extra espresso shot, and then she asked for Kylan’s order.
Katrina watched meticulously as the barista crafted Kylan’s black tea, counting how long she steeped it. She didn’t know how Kylan knew if his tea had been steeped for too long or not, but he always knew. And she was always the one who got the brunt of his annoyance, were it made incorrectly. She wasn’t in the mood to deal with the fallout today, so she continued to watch the barista carefully. Katrina ensured they didn’t add even an ounce of sugar or milk, and then she paid for the drinks and headed back to Oscar.
“How can you make it through a day without coffee, Oscar?” she asked her boss’s driver, not for the first time. Oscar was nearing his fifties, but he was in immaculate shape and still retained most of his hair.
Oscar chuckled from the front seat. “Gummy worms,” he answered her with a coy smile.
She raised her eyebrows in surprise. “That’s actually fantastic,” she laughed, taking a long sip from her coffee. Her chest filled with warmth, and she immediately felt slightly more human.
Chapter 2
Five minutes later, the car was pulling into the massive parking garage beneath the behemoth all-glass building, that was Ross Corp’s headquarters. Oscar parked next to several other standard issued black SUVs and then cut the engine.
She walked inside with him, before he finally had to turn down to the security office, and she to the elevator that would take her upstairs to the top floor of the building.
“Thank you, Oscar,” she said with a wave.
Oscar smiled at her. “Don’t let him push you around too much today, Katrina,” he reminded her.
She sighed and nodded her head. “Absolutely not.”
She smiled at him one more time, before she walked to the elevator, giving a polite greeting to today’s receptionist along the way. She wasn’t at all surprised that it was someone she didn’t recognize, yet again. The employee turnover rate was impacting every department, after all.
A few minutes later, Katrina was walking out into the familiar top floor that housed the various higher-ups of Ross Corp. She walked by Ryan’s office, realizing he was on the phone. She gave him a nod and then continued on her way. This floor of the building was always relatively quiet. Kylan demanded it is that way.
The only sound she heard, was the clicking of her heels on the polished laminated flooring beneath her feet. It unsettled her at times, how lifeless this area of the company seemed to be, but she was mostly used to it by now.
She reached her office at the end of the hall, taking a moment to set down her coffee on her desk, followed by her briefcase next to it. She knew she had a million emails waiting for her eyes to go over, but she also knew that Kylan’s tea would be getting cold, and she couldn’t allow that to happen.
She left her office, his tea in hand, and continued next door. She didn’t bother knocking, she never did anymore. Kylan knew it would be her at this time of day. She pushed open the heavy, oak door, and stepped inside.
Kylan was pacing in front of the window, phone pressed to his ear, and one hand in the pocket of his perfectly tailored navy blue suit. She moved to sit in the chair in front of her desk, setting her tea down in front of her computer. She sat back in her seat, crossing her legs while her eyes trailed Kylan’s walking.
He was always pacing. Even more so, when he was in a mood like he seemed to be today.
“It’s not my fault the fucking paparazzi don’t understand boundaries. I will not be paying to replace their shitty camera,” Kylan quipped into his phone.
Katrina knew exactly the incident he was referring to. He had broken another camera upon leaving a business dinner a few nights ago. She had been there, and she was likely the only reason he got into the waiting car without causing a further commotion. She apologized profusely for Kylan’s thoughtlessness, citing the fact that he absolutely detested having his picture taken in such fashion, but it seemed the company the photographer worked for, wasn’t interested in pleasantries. She honestly couldn’t blame them, either.
No matter how many times she, or Ryan, tried to explain to Kylan that things like the press and paparazzi were going to be a part of everyday life when he was an incredibly young CEO of a multi-billion-dollar company, it never seemed to get through to him. He chose instead to be personally offended by the lack of privacy, and she was left to pick up the broken pieces of Kylan’s public image each time he acted out.
There was a knock on Kylan’s office door, and the face of her most trusted friend poked around the small opening they had created. Katrina cringed, noticing that Kylan flashed her a dangerous look before he turned back to pacing and looking outside.
She took the hint, standing swiftly from her seat and ushering the person outside and back into the hallway. She closed the door behind her quietly, and then she turned to look at her friend.
“He’s in a mood today, Aaron. Is that the new prototype?” she asked, referring to the small machine in Aaron’s hands.
Aaron rolled his eyes. “He’s always in a f*cking mood. I don’t know how you put up with his shit. Lucy and I think-“
She cut him off with a hand pressed to his mouth. Katrina had to stretch to reach his face since he was so much taller than herself, but she managed just fine.
“Aaron, shut up,” she warned him sweetly. “I’m not interested in what you or your girlfriend think of my job, you know that,” she reminded Aaron, for the umpteenth time.
Aaron huffed, his warm breath covering the palm of her hand. He stuck his tongue out, licking her. She squealed and removed her hand.
“You are disgusting,” she groaned as she shook her hand out.
“Better wash your hands before you go back in there. It’s like he has a damn detector for all things germs.”
Aaron shivered, his brown hair falling into his eyes momentarily.
“You’re not wrong,” she relented begrudgingly. “But is that the new prototype?” she pressed.
Aaron nodded. “It is indeed. I call it the “Nightfall 2.0”,” he told her proudly.
“You were meant to have it completed last week,” Katrina reminded Aaron.
He smiled at her sheepishly. “It was a little more difficult to program than either me or Harry anticipated,” he admitted nervously.
You nodded your head in understanding, though you really had no idea how something like programming worked. “All right, I’ll back you up if Kylan loses his shit,” she promised.
Speak of the devil, or in this case just their boss, his office door swung open at that moment. He eyed her for a second before he turned his narrowed gaze to Aaron.
“Marquez, you were meant to have that prototype to me last week,” Kylan said lowly.
Katrina noticed Aaron’s ears turn red at the tips. “I know, Sir. Harry and I are sorry. It was difficult to get the programming down just right. But we finally did it. I have no doubt the mayor will implement this one into the police force, with no issue,” Aaron told Kylan, doing his best to sound confident.
She watched her boss while the cogs turned in his mind. His stark grey eyes were unreadable, as they usually were. His sharp features looked neither too angry nor kind at that moment. The black hair of his bangs threatened to fall into his eyes, and his normally plump lips were pulled in a thin line.
“Very well. Run one more round of diagnostics, and send me the completed reports by this evening,"" he said curtly.
Aaron’s shoulders fell a few inches with obvious relief. “Absolutely,” breathed. He looked at Katrina for a moment. “Drinks tonight?” he asked.
She smiled at him. “We have a late dinner meeting tonight. But Friday, I’m all yours,” she promised.
He rolled his eyes but didn’t dare make any sort of biting remark right in front of Kylan. “See you later, then,” he said, turning around and heading back toward the elevator.
“If you’re done socializing,” Kylan deadpanned, gesturing for her to enter his office.
Katrina bit back a retort, instead walking inside and over to her usual chair in front of his desk. Kylan moved to sit in his oversized, black leather office chair behind his desk. She internally remarked, not for the first time, as to how small he looked sitting in such a chair. But even though he looks short in that humongous office chair, his domineering presence demanded undeniable respect. She was used to the energy he always carried with him, but it still surprised her at times.
“Schedule?” Kylan asked her flatly. He lifted his tea to his lips and took a small drink of it. “Not bad,” he remarked.
Katrina sighed with relief. She wouldn’t have to find a new coffee shop yet, and she was more than glad.
She cleared her throat and picked up the tablet she usually kept on Kylan’s desk. “You have a meeting in half an hour with Kyla&John Techno Corp. They still want you to choose to use their technology, for the new release of the doorbell camera.” She skimmed down the schedule a little further. “We have a free lunch, and then you have a conference call with Jordan Hughes, at two o’clock. He’s the CEO of Elorde Enterprises. He’s the one who keeps trying to get you to play golf with him. He also wants you to use his design on the blackout drones for the military,” Katrina finished before looking up for his reaction.
Kylan scoffed. “Why the f
ck would I play golf? That’s the definition of rich men standing around, parading their d
ck’s in their hands, and bragging about their accomplishments.” He scowled at nothing in particular before taking another drag from his tea.
Katrina nodded her head in agreement. Kylan was many things, but he never openly gloated about his money. She had no idea of his background before Ross Corporation, apart from the scarce information on his company bio. However, she had the distinct impression that Kylan most likely didn’t come from a wealthy background. The very air about him didn’t scream “old money” by any means, anyway.
“I need you to contact Isabel. I’ll probably need a lawyer to deal with this latest paparazzi shit,” Kylan informed her.
She watched as he pinched the bridge of his nose in exasperation, and she took in the dark circles beneath his eyes.
“Have you not been taking your sleeping medication?” Katrina asked him while she jotted down a reminder to call Kylan’s lawyer. She knew the attorney wouldn’t like hearing from her again so soon, but Kylan’s temper had been something else lately.
Kylan glared at her. “It doesn’t do a damn thing to help my insomnia,” he said sternly.
Katrina sighed. “Have you taken it for more than a night or two?” she asked with a quirk of her brow.
Kylan’s glare intensified, and she had her answer.
“It won’t work unless you’re consistent with it, Sir,” she reminded him.
He clicked his tongue in annoyance. “Get off my f*cking back,” he groaned.
Katrina shrugged her shoulders. “Suit yourself,” she glanced down at the schedule in her hands again. “Other than that, we have the stock meeting with Ryan, and then dinner with Charlie. Do you need me for that one?” she asked Kylan curiously.
Kylan sighed and nodded. “The old shit likes you, and it makes it easier to deal with him where I’m not the entire focus of the conversation,” he explained.
He reached into his pocket and pushed his phone her way. She glanced down at it, taking in the severely cracked screen.
“What happened this time?” she asked him, doing her best not to sound too annoyed. Kylan went through a lot of phones, especially lately.
“F*cking Litter,” Kylan responded curtly.
Katrina didn’t fight the roll of her eyes this time. “I thought Ryan and I told you to stop going on there. You need to not engage with the trolls, Sir,” she chastised him.
Kylan glared at her. “F*ck off. They’re insufferable,” he mumbled bitterly.
She laughed slightly. “They’re almost always children, Sir,” she reminded him. “They’re just bored, and you’re famous, by all means. Oftentimes, people forget you’re just a person behind the public image you put out to the world. In your case, it’s not as likely to be much diffHarryt behind closed doors, but they don’t know that for sure,” she explained with a shrug.
“If someone wants to point out my height, or some useless shit like that, I don’t care. But the second someone starts saying I have ulterior motives for my drones, I can’t stand it,” Kylan told her, his eyes downcast and his tone dark.
Katrina nodded sympathetically. “I get it. But reacting the way you do, is exactly what they want,” she told him honestly.
Kylan rolled his eyes. “F*ck off until I need you, Katrina,” he said with a flick of his hand toward the door.
She not so quickly stood from her chair and took her leave without another word.
Kylan didn’t like to talk much about his personal feelings, and she never pushed him to. It was one of the many reasons she had lasted as long as she had at Ross Corp., she was sure of it.
Chapter 3
The day’s meetings and errands continued on in a rush, and by the time their meeting with Ryan rolled around, Katrina was exhausted. She was on her third cup of coffee, and her feet were aching in the confines of her heels.
Still, she managed to get to the meeting with Ryan a little bit early. She took a seat in front of his desk and sighed, finally taking some pressure off her screaming feet.
“Long day?” Ryan mused from behind his desk.
Katrina smiled at him. “I had to get him another phone,” she told the CFO, gesturing to the small bag she had with her.
Ryan chuckled lightly. “I’m not surprised. I saw his ranting and raving on Litter last night, and I figured it would end the way it always does.” He shook his head with another laugh.
“I told him to stop going in there again. I don’t know why he doesn’t just listen,” she said with a tired sigh.
“Maybe because he doesn’t care to listen,” Kylan deadpanned from the doorway of Ryan’s office.
Katrina flashed him a stern look. “Why to bother hiring a PR specialist as your assistant, if you’re not even going to listen to her opinions about how you handle the public?” she asked Kylan carefully.
Kylan sat in the seat next to hers. He looked every bit bored, and she was once again confused as to how a man like himself, and a man like Ryan, had ever come together to create Ross Corp, all those years ago.
“I told you before, and I’ll tell you again. I’ll not have my life called into question the way those internet shits do,” Kylan said sternly. He reached for the bag containing his new phone, and she handed it to him wordlessly.
Ryan sighed loudly from behind his desk. “This is precisely why the stocks are falling, Kylan. Your behavior has never been favorable, but it’s getting increasingly more sporadic. The public’s perception of you translates directly to sales and securing potential deals with fellow companies,” he explained, his eyebrows furrowing. “Stocks have fallen nearly double what they have in the last few years. And they did so over just the last few months alone,” Ryan concluded meekly.
She looked at Kylan with a frown. “He’s right. Your attitude with both the press and people online, have both been lacking any kind of humanity. It goes against what Ross Corporation stands for, at its basic function. Which is to aid in the investigations of the police, and the security of someone’s home,” she reminded her boss.
Kylan scoffed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “What would you have me do?” He asked both Katrina and Ryan impatiently.
Katrina looked at Ryan expectantly. She had no idea what to do, truthfully. Talking to Kylan and reminding him why it was never a good idea to get in a fight with a teenager on the internet or to grab and toss a photographer’s camera, never worked. Katrina honestly wasn’t sure what would get through to him, if anything could at all.
“We’re losing employees rapidly. Their work environment has no life to it anymore,” she added for good measure. It was true, there was no company spirit, or pride anymore. What once was a vibrant, blossoming company in its infancy, was now a lackluster and slowly dying spark.
Something needed to change. And quickly.
“I have a proposal,” Ryan began cautiously. Katrina and Kylan both looked at him curiously, and he cleared his throat. “I think… Well, Kylan, I think you need to begin a relationship with someone. It needs to be someone with the right personality. Someone with whom you can openly show to the world, and who can handle the inevitable limelight that will follow. You need someone charismatic, who can shine when you yourself choose to complain,” he droned on.
She couldn’t say she was entirely surprised by Ryan’s proposal. Kylan was, after all, a thirty-two-year-old bachelor. She could understand the public appeal that could come from a seemingly unobtainable, hardened individual, dating a less high maintenance person.
If it were at all possible to appeal to Kylan’s humanity to the public, he had to do it. He had to try. Or Ross Corp would be run into the ground.
“I think it’s a fantastic idea,” she agreed earnestly. “If you can appear even a little more… Approachable, or relatable on a personal level, we need to showcase that,” she added for good measure. “And that is having a girlfriend.”
“A wife,” Ryan suddenly said.
Katrina turned to Ryan while Kylan had his eyebrows furrowed so much that his face looked scrunched and constipated.
“I mean, someone you can agree with for a fake marriage. A contract.”
Katrina’s face lit up before looking at her boss. “That’s right! Having a fiance, someone you will “marry” is more convincing than having a girlfriend.”
Kylan was looking at both Katrina and Ryan like they had each grown a second head, and she knew she was fighting a losing battle already.
“How many fights did you get into on Litter yesterday?” she decided to ask Kylan.
Her boss shot her a menacing glare, but she didn’t even flinch. Katrina was so used to his tactics, and Ryan wasn’t wrong with this idea.
“How many phones have you gone through in this last week alone?” she pressed on.
Kylan sighed and rubbed his forehead, very clearly annoyed. He ran his fingers through his hair, pushing his bangs back in the process. “I only get into fights on Litter that are worthy of my time,” he grumbled.
Katrina very nearly laughed. “Fighting with, what is it, twelve year old’s, is worthy of your time?” she mused, her eyebrows raised in amusement.
“F*ck off. The one yesterday was a damn tyrant,” Kylan insisted with yet another glare aimed her way.
She shook her head. “Sir, did you not hire me because I graduated college with a double major in public relations and business management?” she asked her boss.
Katrina was already exhausted from trying to sway his feelings, but this wasn’t a situation where she could relent, and she knew that. Something had to give, and this was a logical idea.
“I can fire you just as quickly, Katrina,” Kylan reminded her, but his voice lacked any bite. She knew as well as he did, that Kylan would drown without Katrina Morgan. He had gone through enough assistants before her, for him to realize as much.
“Think about it, Sir. You’re thirty-two. You’ve never openly dated anyone. If you pick the right partner, you could appear vastly more relatable and human. Go to a few galas, take some pictures, and post some of those on social media. It makes sense. You’re plenty desirable around the city, among both women and men alike,” she continued to try and sway Kylan.
She knew probably better than anyone, that Kylan didn’t date. She wasn’t entirely certain he even knew how to date. It was impossible for her to picture someone like Ross Corp’s CEO being… Open enough to date anyone. She couldn’t even wrap her mind around the concept.
Sure, she knew he had the occasional one-night stand. She had run into one or two of the women as they left his penthouse when Katrina dropped off his dry cleaning, but that was as far as any sort of relationship going.
Ryan had been sitting silently for the duration of her speech, watching both her and Kylan closely. She wasn’t sure if he would have any more luck than herself, but she looked at him for help. Graciously, he took the hint.
“Kylan, you and I have worked incredibly hard to build Ross Corp from the ground up. We’re in twenty-seven countries, and in almost five-million homes around the world. Several police forces have opted to use our drones. It pains me greatly to see our stocks plummeting and to see you receiving the brunt of the backlash on social media. Would you please at least consider this idea?” he implored Kylan.
Kylan sighed, shoving his hands in the pockets of his immaculately pressed suit, and then he began to pace. Katrina and Ryan, both let him walk for a while. Katrina had said all she could, and now she had to let Kylan process the information. It was how he worked, each time a big decision was involved. This was no different, and perhaps it was an even larger choice than what was normal.
“F*cking fine. I don’t see how this could possibly help the company, but I’m not the PR expert, I suppose,” Kylan looked at her with narrowed eyes, and she flashed him a small smile. “Give me a week to find someone,” he told her and Ryan, looking at both of them in turn.
“Do you need help downloading some dating apps, or something similar? I just need to know your preferences. Woman, man-“ She was effectively cut off.
“Woman, Katrina. And no. I’ll try and find someone the good old-fashioned way, by going to a f*cking bar,” Kylan pinched the bridge of his nose.
She nodded her head. “Sounds good, Sir. If there’s nothing else, I’m going to freshen up before we go to dinner with Charlie.” She stood from her chair and waited to be dismissed.
“Fine.” Kylan waved her away.
Katrina gave a polite nod to her boss, and then she smiled with relief at Ryan, before she left his office.
She didn’t know if this would really work, but she and Ryan were hopeful.
She couldn’t help but feel mildly sorry for the poor woman Kylan was going to marry. He really was an impossible man to get along with.
Chapter 4
Half an hour later, she was back in an SUV with Oscar, waiting for Kylan to make his appearance. Every two weeks, she had dinner with Keith, Kylan’s uncle. He was an angel investor for Ross Corp, and the only thing he asked in return, was to have dinner with Kylan.
Keith was someone that Kylan could tolerate slightly more than others, much like Ryan and herself. Sometimes, he asked her to go to dinner too, and other times he let her go home instead. She wasn’t surprised he would want her involved today, with the extra prevalent shadow hanging over his head.
Kylan finally made his way into the back seat of the car. He sat next to her, with only the middle seat in between them. She gave him a small smile, and he nodded his head at her.
“Did you-“ he began.
She knew what he was going to ask. “Your dry cleaning was picked up and taken home,” she told him calmly.
“And what about-“ he added.
“Your suit for the gala this weekend? Pressed and tailored. It’s at your home, too,” she said with the same calm tone.
Kylan nodded at her slowly, eyeing her carefully. “Right. Good work,” he said curtly.
It was the closest her boss ever came to saying thank you, and she smiled at him again in response.
Twenty minutes later, Oscar was dropping Katrina and Kylan off at the latest upscale restaurant Keith chose. Kylan had the decency to hold the car door open for her, and she nodded at him in thanks as she climbed out.
Keith was already waiting inside when they walked in, and the two of them made their way over to him, Kylan on her heels. She sat down across from Keith, with Kylan on her right.
“Ahh, my dear Kate. You’re still working for this grumpy little shit?” Keith asked her, lifting his glass of a far too expensive Cabernet Sauvignon, and taking a long drink from it.
She laughed and nodded. “I am.”
Kylan scoffed and lifted the glass of whiskey Keith had already ordered for him. “I wanted it neat, old man,” he complained about the ice in his cup.
“I’ll take that one if you don’t want it. I’ll order you a new one,” she offered her boss.
Kylan eyed her curiously before he handed her his whiskey. Katrina drank it easily, wincing as the fiery liquid skirted down her throat.
Dinner went as it always did, with Keith poking and prodding at Kylan relentlessly, and Kylan responding with less and less patience as time wore on.
Katrina entered the conversation where she felt it was relevant, but she spent the majority of the time enjoying her steak and vegetables quietly. It was really the only true draw from these fancy dinners: the expensive food.
She noticed that Kylan was looking at her more so than he usually did. She couldn’t read h",1,1743920322.0,Novelideas,1,1.0,False

Hey all,

I’m a bearded and tattooed 39 year old guy that is pretty bored and lonely.  I have a family but I can’t help but feel empty I guess. Let’s fix it.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes work sends me places so maybe we can meet if I end up near you. I play music badly, write songs that I sing over this bad music. Well, kind of growl since I’m a metalhead and singing is silly. Also I can’t sing.

I’m love a good coffee and a recipe. I love sharing both. I enjoy reading probably as much as I do writing, a bit more sometimes. I enjoy a good drink. Scotch is my main one, I am pretty good at making any mixed drink. I love to bartend when people are over.

You? Who are you, actually. How do you understand life and yourself. Let me know you and you know me and we’ll see where it goes.

We could be awesome friends, want to try it out?",1,1743920071.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
