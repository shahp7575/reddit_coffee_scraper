1hk8vok,https://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/1hk8vok/juicing_vs_green_powder/,Juicing vs green powder ,"I feel depending on which subreddit I post this I'll get different and biased answers. The juicing group will definitely like juicing and the supplement group would like green powders. I guess neither are wrong depending on who I ask. 

I wanted to ask everyone's opinion. I think everyone agrees that eating veggies and fruits is healthy and preferably but I'm horrible at prepping food. I'm someone who would use a coffee pod over brewing my own coffee because it's quicker and easier. I'm debating between take some green powder supplements or juicing. This is provided that I still make an attempt to have a balanced diet and not rely or the powder or juice solely. I didn't even think of doing this till my cousin gave me a tub of her bloom green powder. It was yummy and convenient but I remember loving juices in the past. So I cannot make up my mind.

Juicing.
I don't have a juicer but I think I can get a decent one for under $150. I've had cold pressed juices before and I find it delicious. The pro is delicious, nutritious, easy to carry on the go.
Some cons for me at least: lots of prep (washing and cutting), expensive if I buy good greens, pretty time consuming I think. 

Green powder.
I started researching bloom and ag1. I know the common consensus is green powder is just marketing so here's my pros and cons. Pros: easy to travel with, convenient, tasty, supplement and close my nutritious gap. Cons: not sure if it's be more or less pricy than juicing if intake it daily, are green powders even potent enough to make a difference.

At the end of the day, I just want the price to potency ratio to make sense. For example, if juicing is so much better and it cost a little more than the powder then juicing would win the race. But if juicing with good greens will cost me a fortune then no I don't think I could keep up with it. And with green powder they have so many different ones. My cousin swears by bloom but I read it's not that potent. Then there's ag1 that's more expensive. 

Another thing is with the powder I could just stop when it doesn't work for me. Whereas with juicing I'll have the upfront cost of a juicer as well.

Your marketing methods now won't work beyond 2025, businesses need to do more than just exist online—they need to dominate locally. Local SEO is the key to ensuring your business stands out in “near me” searches, gets on Google Maps, and connects with the customers who matter most. 🗺️✨

# Why Focus on Local SEO? 🌟

# Increased Local Competition 🏪📊

With businesses vying for visibility in the same area, ranking high on local search results has never been more important. Local SEO helps you target location-based keywords, such as “emergency plumbing near me” or “best coffee shop in \[city\],” giving you the edge over your competitors. 📈🔍

# Changing Search Behavior 🛍️📱

Consumers rely on “near me” searches to find businesses nearby. These hyper-local queries, often made on mobile devices, demand accurate and optimized listings. Local SEO ensures your business is where your customers are looking—front and center. 🤳🗺️

# Better Conversions 💰🎯

Local SEO isn’t just about visibility—it’s about attracting high-intent customers. People searching for services near them are ready to act, making local SEO a direct pipeline to conversions and revenue growth. 🔥💼

Local SEO focuses on optimizing your online presence to attract customers within a specific geographical area. It ensures that your business appears in local searches, Google Maps results, and directories, making it easier for customers to find and trust your services. 🌐📍

1hk8pzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hk8pzx/dame_maggie_smiths_passing_is_hitting_me_hard/,Dame Maggie Smith’s passing is hitting me hard.,"So, as some (or hopefully many) of you may know, dame Maggie Smith passed away a few weeks ago. I was upset at the news of course but I didn’t really know her as a person, and she obviously didn’t know me so it made no sense to be distraught about it. 

However, today I watched the second best exotic marigold hotel and *spoiler alert* it is implied that she passes at the end. There’s a long monologue overlaid over wedding celebrations and I just couldn’t hold back my tears. For some reason, even though I’ve only seen her in 3 things - Harry Potter, Downton Abbey and TBEMG, I feel so deeply connected to her. And I think it’s because I didn’t cry when my own grandmother died in 2022.

In 2022, my grandmother had a sudden onset of an autoimmune condition and deteriorated rapidly. She was still learning to live without my grandfather who passed in 2017 (who I admit shamefully was my favourite and has deeply deeply inspired me to be the person I am today and my brother was always closer to her than I was anyways.)

I felt it was too childish to cry then. My mother, an only child, lost both parents in the span of five years which may not be such a short period of time but it sure felt like it. I also felt like I owed it to my brother to allow his emotions to be felt deeper if that makes sense? 

But seeing this movie and thinking of my own grandmother makes me so sad that I didn’t cry then. She was the most loving, kind person till the very end and it was very hard to see her deteriorate so fast. I feel even more guilty as I was in the beginning of a beautiful relationship with my current partner. I feel guilty that I didn’t spend enough time with her. She raised me from when I was a newborn till I was 4 so my mother could continue working and I couldn’t spare a few hours a week and I couldn’t spare any tears during her funeral. 

I wish I could tell her that I miss her and that I’m sorry I didn’t cry for her then. I wouldn’t want her to think I spent all my tears on my grandfather and had none left for her. She was special to me too and I only wish I had told her more. I wish we could’ve shared another ice cream together. 


I’m sorry grandma, I’m crying now and I miss your coffee more than ever.

I have a wonderful family, children and amazing husband.  However my relationship with my friends are more surface level.  I’ve seen my elders, elder women, have great friendships. I’ve witnessed women having beautiful sisterhood’s where they go through great despair in their own lives, and have each other to lean on, whether it be difficulties in marriage, illness, trouble with children, health, work etc. And when they do speak to each other, there is such respect. Not just an exchange of “nice” words, but honest conversations where they give each other raw advice and don’t beat around the bush, just being direct with love behind every word because it all comes from a place of care. One of my friends has distanced herself from me because I did this. So now for fear of losing a friend, I often keep to myself if a friend tells me something personal. 
I long for a group of friends, women who I could grow old with because I think that it’s healthy to have a good support system. Friends that are not afraid of telling me the truth no matter how difficult it could be. I don’t struggle to be social at all. I love to go out, get coffee, grab a bite to eat. I’d love to host book club gatherings or binge spicy shows like Bridgestone or gossip on the playground about the Blake Lively drama while the kids run around and play. I once saw the movie The Book Club and I hope to have something like that when I’m older.

I've had my oracle jet for less than a week but I've already purchased the Breville bottomless portafilter and yesterday I received my IMS big bang basket.

I just wanted to say that using the IMS Basket with my jet has resulted in much better shots. I'm only using Lavazza coffee beans i got from Costco, not super fresh beans but my shots using the Breville baskets just seemed bitter no matter what i did. I think the faster flow rate I'm getting from the IMS basket has resulted in much better tasting shots. I'm now able to grind the same beans finer and get consistent shot times of 24-26 seconds with much better flavor profiles. My initial thoughts is the baskets that come with the Breville are just a bit too slow and are harder to dial in shots with vs an aftermarket basket, especially if you're just using bulk coffee from Costco.

I'm new to the jet and espresso in general but I figured I'd post this to let others know my recent experience.

This year, I initially told my mom that I was going to stay home in Alabama, and would not be joining her on the trip. I told her this after she had booked her flight, and did not offer up a reason other than ""I just don't feel like traveling this year"". Well, she manipulated the situation as per usual, and had my aunt and uncle surprise me with a 3-way call. I allowed myself to be sucked into going, with the condition that I will be driving there rather than flying, and bringing my dog with me. I'm not too pleased that I was unable to stand my ground, but what's done is done. I'm going there tomorrow. What I have done now is make sure my schedule is jam packed so that I am at the house as little as possible, and therefore am around my mom as little as possible. Here's why:

Over the past year or so, I have been in pretty intense therapy, processing the abuse I underwent as a child, partly at the hands of my mom. My mom is a narcissist (yes, I hate to use that word as I feel it is a buzzword, but multiple therapists that I have seen over the years have told me that this is what is going on). I have also recently learned that she is an enmeshed mother. 

Growing up, she was hyper-invovled in my life to the point where I felt my identity was merged into hers. She wanted us to dress in the same style, wear our hair the same, she picked out what classes I would take, who I would date, she was super involved with my friends and even demanded to join my plans with my friends like going out to bars or dinners, etc. I didn't know any better growing up, but as I started getting older, I felt super smothered and didn't know why. I have chosen to set some pretty hard boundaries with my mom this year, and it is still something I have to work on. She asks to see me every single day, and if I tell her I can't, she keeps asking almost begging me to see her. If I tell her I can't because I have plans with a friend, she gets angry and gets between my friendships. She even asks ""can I come"". It's strange to me that she thinks it is normal for a 60 year old mother to want to go to bars and outings with her 27 year old daughter and her friends. She also calls me over 10 times per day, most of which I do not answer. She spam texts me all day too. It's a lot. These behaviors get a lot worse when she drinks, which she does often. 

She is on a plane now to Mississippi, and I plan to drive there tomorrow. I have planned workout classes for every day, coffee shops I plan to go to and just other outings so that I am not in the house much with her. Whenever we go to MS to visit our family for Christmas, it feels like there's no escape. Last year I had to lock my bedroom door because if I would leave the living room early to go to bed, she would open my door multiple times asking me to spend time with her, asking stupid questions just for attention, ""just saying hi"", etc. It's annoying. I even fear going to the bathroom down the hall because as soon as she hears my footsteps she starts the harrassment.

1hk8ff5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1hk8ff5/lotus_water_drops_what_happened/,Lotus Water Drops - what happened?,"Got myself some Lotus Water Drops a couple of days ago after contemplating for ages how to tackle my water problem (tap water isn't THAT high in ppm, about 160, however a lot of it is calcium (I get deposits very quickly), and the pH is bordering on 8, so very high.

I bought some 1 liter bottles of demineralized water from the store (tested with a tds meter, still had some ppm, around 2-3). 

I've been looking online for some recipes, and landed on Scott Rao's newer recipe, the one on the sticky note. I have the new dripper, which means I used half the drops stated on it. Shook the bottles before use, then I individually added the drops to each liter bottle (as the recipe is per liter), let it mix well, and then added them all together in a bigger jug for ease of use. 
Once I was done I measured the water with the same tds meter, and to my surpise it read 170 ppm (!). I was kind of taken aback, since usually most people would say the 'best' water is anywhere between 60 and 80 ppm. And here my self made water is higher in ppm than my tap water. 

The coffee I made with it definitely isn't bad by any means, however some of the more vibrant flavors in for example DAK's cinnamon bun were muted, and you could taste the 'roast' flavor more. 

I'm kind of wondering if:

- I did something wrong (maybe I'm interperting the measurements incorrectly or dripped incorrectly)

- If something is wrong with the drops I bought (there are some deposits visible in the sodium and calcium dripper, on both the inside and outside of the glass)

- Or if Scott's recipe naturally is a lot higher in ppm than most others? 

That being said, would love to hear what kind of recipes you guys have made or are using. I'm mostly into (very) light roast, funky stuff (maceration, co-ferments, etc), however I also drink plenty of washed Kenya's.",1,1734903570.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

1hk8eov,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1hk8eov/we_may_be_contributing_to_a_shopping_addiction/,We may be contributing to a shopping addiction,"We've had this guest staying with us for a couple weeks now who likes to bring treats and gifts to the front desk. She's an interesting character, but she doesn't bother anyone or make a mess so we don't mind. It started small, she brought me a soda and an instant ramen bowl. Then a couple days later she had gone to the fast food restaurant next door for dinner and brought me back dinner.

The next day she brought me a McRib. I was appreciative, but have to admit I was also a little annoyed though I didn't show it. 1) When she brought it to me I was in the process of ordering a pizza online, which was what I wanted for dinner but I don't like wasting food. 2) I'm a picky eater. I had to pick the pickles and onions off the McRib, and I passed the instant ramen off to someone else because it wasn't a kind I would like. She also brought me a frozen dinner once that wasn't something I'd eat either, fortunately easy to pass something like that off to someone else.

In chatting with her, I determined she just buys stuff for people. Like the ramen bowl had shrimp, which she is allergic to but bought anyway. She told me about being at the store and buying stuff and then just giving it to the cashiers and having to go back and rebuy the item. What the hell, right?

Then I was sick with a bad cold or something, and really didn't have much of an appetite and she seemed almost frustrated that I didn't want any of what she was offering to buy me. I finally relented and agreed to let her get me some gatorade.

She'll also buy whole boxes of donuts and cookies for the staff, and bags of chips and 2 liters of soda. Almost daily she is bringing us this stuff. Then one day she decided she wanted to buy everyone lunch from a nearby taco truck. Here my being a picky eater became a problem again because I was pretty sure I wouldn't be able to eat anything they had. Maybe if I could have looked at a menu I could have found something but that wasn't an option. I haven't been diagnosed with ARFID, but if a doctor told me that was what was up with me I'd believe them. Attempting to eat a food I don't like or being surprised at an ingredient in food can and has made me sick. I even almost threw up once just from surprise when a fast food place gave me sweet tea instead of Pepsi. I don't even hate sweet tea, I don't really like it but I wasn't expecting it so my body was like ""EJECT! EJECT! EJECT!""

I still wasn't at 100% so I tried to convince her that she didn't need to get me anything but she was very insistent. She knows I'm a picky eater, we'd since had this conversation but I don't think she really understood just how picky. I told her to just get me whatever the plainest thing she could with no onions or lettuce especially. Peppers I can probably manage. So she comes back a little while later and has a torta for me... that's chock full of stuff I can't eat. I tried not to sound like an asshole when I did it, but I turned it down citing my pickiness. Then she brought me a taco that again was full of onions and other stuff I'm not going to eat. After I rejected that also she offered to go back and get me something but at that point I was so frustrated and annoyed by the situation I just lied and said I really wasn't hungry because I was still sick. Then I had to sneak some snacks because I was actually hungry but I didn't want her to see and try to buy me food again.

Another time she brought me a box of fried chicken from the grocery store, and it was still hot. She had me split it up and box some up for the night auditor. A couple days later when I came in for a morning shift she brought me a plate of fried chicken that was room temperature. With that questionable food safety, I just tossed it out as soon as she was gone and again had to hide and eat my actual lunch so she wouldn't question why I wasn't eating the chicken. Also I don't know why she keeps buying chicken, she told me she is allergic.

Today she moved on from just buying food and drink and decided to start buying us stuff. Apparently she felt she needed to get Christmas gifts for employees' children. She asked me what I knew about the NA's kid and I've never met her so I just shared what I knew. She disregarded all this apparently and went around Walmart asking random people what a child her age might like and bought that. She also bought me a sweatshirt that was too small for me, which I found flattering and joked about it. I also joked that if she keeps buying me all these snacks it's going to be that much smaller. She tried to talk me into letting her buy me a hoody or a jacket but I really don't need one. I wear the same hoody all the time and already have a couple knock around ones, plus two jackets only one of which I ever wear. I jokingly told her she can buy me socks if she wants, and then she asked for my shoe size to know what size to get me.

She seemed torn on whether or not she should buy presents for the other NA and day shift woman's kids (they are married). But she doesn't like the day shift woman. She thinks *she* doesn't like her because she's lighter skinned and has ""good hair"" but the reality is that the day shift woman is just less willing to entertain her mindless chatting and complaining about work.

Speaking of mindless chatting, I've posted about a different chatter box [before](https://redd.it/1gdmi8h). To my amusement, the shopaholic also doesn't like her. She was complaining to me one day about her and how she never shuts up. The shopaholic also talks too much, but she actually talks to you rather than at you and has the social skills to know when a conversation has been exhausted. The buying us shit helps too, even when I don't want it lol. At this point she has probably spent several hundred dollars on staff.

Then the homeless woman who never shuts up has apparently decided we're not friends anymore. She had been telling people I was her god daughter (?!), but now she told day shift she's mad at me because one day she came in the lobby while I was in the back making coffee and told her to hold on a minute in a rude way. I don't remember this, but she annoys the fuck out of me so I don't doubt my mask slipped for a moment when she interrupted me while I was busy. I wish I'd realized this was all it would take sooner so she'd have stopped bothering me quicker.",3,1734903509.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,1,0.8,False

He works for an airline & will be based out of Concord airport. We currently live in a neighborhood in Orlando that is urban due to its close proximity to downtown, but it has that suburban feel (lots of young couples, families, pet friendly, quieter, safe, etc). We are definitely looking for something similar in Charlotte if possible. We would prefer to be in the city, but we are open to looking outside of Charlotte in other areas if they are up and coming. We don't drink, but we love to explore different restaurants and coffee shops and other events in the area. We want to be in an area that can offer that. We have 2 dogs and we are also looking for an area that is walkable and pet friendly. We also love outdoor activities. We don't have kids and aren't planning on having them in the near future.

Our budget is about $2,500/month for an apartment. We would be open to renting a condo or a townhome, but we are sticking to just looking at apartments for now since that is what we are in right now.

We are looking for something that would be 45 min or less of a commute for him to Concord airport.

CW for some eating disorder talk.

**History**: 33F here with a history of GERD. My symptoms have always primarily been painful reflux with vomiting in the middle of the night, but I have not had an episode in months since starting a PPI. I have an eating disorder history that included purging, but I have not used that behavior in over a month, nor was that used multiple months before that. I also have issues with regurgitation soon after challenging meals when strong purging urges may occur, although this issue has slowed down a lot too. 

**Topic issue:** I ate breakfast and had coffee around 9:30 am today. It is 4:30 pm and I haven't consumed anything since breakfast, minus about five Twizzlers (lawl). I have been having rumination symptoms for the last 4 to 5 hrs and I want to make it clear that I do **not** have rumination syndrome. I am regurgitating mostly digested food. I feel slightly gassy, but I am passing things along and I have been having normal to larger-than-normal BMs over the weekend. I was constipated this past week, which happens sometimes due to inconsistent intake. Water intake needs improvement as I behaviorally fluid-restrict, sometimes. I have no abdominal pain, although I am starting to feel bloated and constipated again. My last large BM was about 30 mins after I ate breakfast, so \~6.5 hrs ago.

1hk8bol,https://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/1hk8bol/frischs_demise/,Frisch's demise - ,"The Frich's we all knew and loved passed away a long time ago, but few people truly understand the complicated web of transactions - including those with the city and Hamilton county - that lead to it's demise.  Ultimately the end game of all of this was to acquire commercial real estate by insuring that once the land was worth more than the rental income, franchisees would be evicted.

* August 2015 – Craig Maier, CEO of Frisch’s Restaurants since 1989, pushes through the sale of the company to NRD Capital Partners which is owned by Aziz Hashim.  The board of directors voted against the deal, but Mr. Maier (who held 10% of the company) obtained shareholder approval for the “take private” sale – netting himself $17.5M in addition to the $967k he earned in his final year as CEO. 
* September 2015 – NRD Capital Partners flips the real estate under 19 Greater Cinci Frisch’s to National Retail Properties (a REIT formed ironically by Golden Corral as an employee equity vehicle) for $47M and leases back the land to the NRD Partners.  At the time Mr. Hashim said no further land transactions would occur.  The lease-backs set a 20 year rental agreement in motion, with annualized rent increases scheduled regardless of actual location sales.  From the outside these rental increases seem counter-productive, but they insure that if the value of the land exceeds that of the restaurant, the location is easily evicted so that the land assets become unencumbered.
* July 2017 – NRD Capital closes it’s second fundraising round with a gain of $100M
* January 2018 – NRD Capital purchases Ruby Tuesdays again against the Board of Directors vote but with shareholder approval.  A minority of shareholders threatened a class action filing, but it was never completed. Unlike Frisch’s, nearly all Ruby Tuesday’s were company operated, with only 55 operated by franchisees.  By 2020 half of the 500+ locations would be closed.
* February 2020 – Shares in National Retail Properties hit an all time of $58. Then…
* April 2020 – After the disastrous results of Covid shutdowns become official, shares of National Retail Properties collapse to $26.  To date the shares have yet to break above $50 and are currently trading around $40/share.
* July 2020 – Seven locations closed, including the Fountain Square location which had just opened less than two years earlier.
* May 2021 – Frisch’s CEO Jason Vaugh vacates position and Tony Vasconcellos is named President and CFO. No new CEO is named.
* May 2022 – The Frisch’s Commissary property is sold to National Net Lease Group for $10.35M.  In retrospect this is likely the clearest sign of what is to come.  Frisch’s still has 13 years remaining on it’s existing lease, and the fact that the property was sold was likely due to NRD Capital recognizing that in the near future they would be unable to meet those payment obligations. Frisch’s begins sourcing food from Sysco Foods and reduces staff.
* August 2022 – James Walker named Frisch’s new CEO, the first time the position has been occupied in nearly a year.
* April 2023 – National Retail Properties reorganizes and changes it’s name to NNN Reit.  At the time it holds some 35M square feet of leasable area across 3,411 properties. 
* April 2024 – Frisch’s announces the layoff of over 200 office, commissary, and administrative staff.
* April 2024 – Revel Systems (Frisch’s point of sale software provider) lawsuit filed in the Southern District Court of Ohio to recover $4.7M in losses is approved to move forward by Judge Douglas Cole.
* May 2024 – Covington, Beavercreek locations close.
* October 2024 – The flood of closures begin as NNN Reit files multiple eviction notices in Hamilton County.  By October 10^(th) NNN Reit served 27 3-day notices to leave and 14 eviction actions and promised additional court action.  Court documents show that the rents due for October alone totaled over $1.2M and that the amount was due regardless of occupation.
* November 2024 – The last Franklin county location closes along with multiple landmark locations in Cheviot, Norwood, Colerain, Harrison, North College Hill and West Price Hill.
* November 2024 – Don Short and Cheryl White lead an investment group to purchase several locations and the rights for “future development of the brand”.  What this actually means in practice is unclear.
* December 2024 – The Commissary ceases operation, and all staff were terminated without notice or severance.  The Commissary was not under the lease-back deal with NNN Reit, but a separate lease-back with NGCRE Investment XIII LLC, which had recently increased the annual rent to $657k.  News reports with several former staff indicate that they were required to sign paperwork to obtain final checks and that they received no or limited reimbursement for accrued vacation time.  This leaves open the question about where any remaining locations will obtain baked goods, as well as what food sourcing contracts will be honored.  Additionally, new vendors will need to be sourced for branded products such as cups and paper goods.  The legal and ownership status of such assets remains unclear.
* December 2024 – NNN Reit lease-back locations have either closed or will be closed by the end of the month.  The CVG terminal location and 8 other locations in NKY, Hamilton, West Chester, and Liberty Township are not owned by NNN Reit and could continue to operate if vendors and suppliers are able to be sourced.  13 additional locations not owned by NNN Reit, but outside of the 13-county Cincinnati region also remain in operation.
* December 2024 – In addition to the Revel Systems and NNN Reit lawsuits, Frisch’s faces additional litigation on behalf of FC Cincinnati, CrunchTime Information Systems Inc., Schreiber Foods, Joffrey Coffee & Tea Company, and Pilgrim’s Pride which together total some $6M in unpaid invoices and claimed damages.
* December 2024 – WCPO reports that by early 2025, less than 20 non-NNN Reit lease-back locations will remain in operation.  4 of these locations are owned by a different trust – Broadstone FR Portfolio LLC, which could chose to follow the same path as NNN Reit leaving only a handful of unencumbered locations which would then need to carry the cost of operations, but would have none of the negotiating clout or vendor relationships that the organization possessed at it’s peak.",1,1734903263.0,cincinnati,2,0.53,False

Everything about this was suboptimal to say the least. He was on his first major investigation, he lacked a partner, and this investigation would take place in one of the most rural parts of the state. Not only that, but due to “policy” he had to take a civilian car to take him here, which meant that he arrived in his own rusty old brown el camino from the 80s. Back in his precinct he usually took the police cars for personal travels as well. He was too good to be reprimanded by his chief for a miniscule off-the-books infringement like that. Nonetheless he was here and had a job to do. His cold hand took his glasses, which had fogged up by now, and stashed them deep in the inside pockets of his dark grey wool coat. 

The parking lot he stepped out into was the same as in any other slowly dying former boom town. A rundown motel, broken neon signs, trash, the usual really. After adjusting himself to the light rain and cold temperatures he made his way over towards the motel’s entrance. He stepped inside, slicking back his slightly wet dark brown medium long hair, finding himself in a small reception room with lighting that was already starting to give him a headache. Suddenly a sharp ringing cut through the air after Henry had hit the “ring here” bell to notify some staff to come to the reception desk. Unfortunately, nothing seemed to happen, that was until the door through which he had entered opened behind him.

“You’re the detective, aren’t you?”

The woman behind him seemed to be a local police officer. She wore the typical sheriff’s uniform, with a dusty brown leather jacket, paired with black uniform pants and the usual bravado of someone with authority. 

“Yes, as a matter of fact I am. Special Agent Henry Neal.” 

He supressed the urge to show his badge. For some reason he still was usually assuming that no one would believe him to be a police officer.

“Good. I’m deputy Riley Harper. Come on, Jennifer won’t be here for another hour, she’s out for a drink or two, well, maybe five…”

Henry followed the deputy across the road, past some old shops and to a small diner. It looked like every stereotypical American diner you could imagine. Inside she sat down with him at one of the tables and took off her jacket, just as a waitress approached her.

“Hello there Riley!” 

The woman who was probably in her 40s greeted the deputy with a warm smile on her face.

“What can I bring you today?”

She looked at Henry and her smile turned more into a smirk.

“And the handsome fellow you brought with yourself?”

“Stop…”

Clearly the deputy felt embarrassed by this interaction, though she was “saved” by a strong raspy voice coming from the counter.

“Oy, Sally.” An older man with little to no hair aside from his thick grey beard stood behind the counter with his arms crossed.
“We don’t serve that kinda folk round ‘ere.” His comment clearly was targeted towards Henry.

“Listen, I just need a coffee with milk for myself and one to go for the chief.” The deputy said and smiled.

“Coming right up!” The waitress answered and left for the counter.

“So…” the deputy faced Henry, “You’re probably here for the hanged man aren’t you?”

He looked at her, actually having heard that the murder victim had been hanged for the first time just now.

“Yes, exactly.”

Body:
Hey coffee enthusiasts,

I'm currently trying to decide between two grinders, and I'd love to get your opinions!

I own a La Pavoni Professional in chrome, so aesthetics matter to me—I'd like the grinder to match my setup. That makes the La Pavoni Aluminium Cilindro (£440) a tempting choice since it complements the look perfectly.

That said, I also want a grinder that’s future-proofed and offers top-tier performance, which has me leaning toward the Eureka Oro Mignon Single Dose also in chrome. I've heard a lot of praise about its consistency and usability, especially for single dosing.


Price: Both are around the same price point, so cost isn’t a deciding factor here.

Longevity/Future-proofing: I want a grinder that will serve me well for years and handle potential upgrades in my coffee journey.

What do you think? Is the La Pavoni grinder worth it for the matching setup, or does the Eureka Oro Mignon outshine it in terms of performance and long-term value?

------------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for our survival. But when it comes to the question, ""How much water should I drink daily?"" the answer can be surprisingly complicated. The science behind hydration reveals several factors that influence how much water your body needs. Let’s dive into the details.

The human body is composed of approximately **60% water**. This water plays vital roles in our physiological functions, such as regulating body temperature, keeping joints lubricated, and aiding in nutrient absorption. Since our bodies constantly lose water through sweat, urine, and even breathing, replenishing it is crucial for maintaining health.

Generally, many health authorities recommend the ""8 by 8"" rule. This suggests drinking eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day, totaling about 2 liters or half a gallon. However, recent studies indicate that this guideline may not fit everyone. Individual hydration needs can vary greatly based on several factors.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Here are some important factors that affect how much water you need:

- **Body Size:** Larger individuals have higher hydration needs. For instance, if you weigh more, your body will require more water to function properly.
- **Activity Level:** If you exercise or sweat excessively, your body needs additional fluids to recover. Aim to drink more before, during, and after your workout.
- **Climate:** Living in a hot or humid environment can increase your need for water. In such conditions, your body loses fluids rapidly through sweat.
- **Diet:** The foods you consume can also affect hydration. Foods with high water content, such as fruits and vegetables, can contribute to your daily intake. Conversely, salty or sugary foods may require you to drink more water to balance your body’s needs.
- **Age and Health Conditions:** As you get older, your body may become less efficient at conserving water. Additionally, certain health conditions or medications may increase your fluid requirements.

Listening to your body is an excellent way to gauge your hydration needs. Thirst is a natural indication that you should drink more water. However, many people do not realize they are starting to become dehydrated until it's too late. Here are some signs of dehydration to watch for:

- **Dark Yellow Urine:** A strong color can indicate insufficient hydration. Ideally, urine should be light yellow or clear.
- **Dry Mouth and Thirst:** Feeling thirsty is your body’s way of signaling that you need more water.
- **Fatigue:** Dehydration can lead to feelings of tiredness and decreased energy levels.
- **Dizziness or Headaches:** Not drinking enough water can impact your overall well-being, sometimes leading to headaches or dizziness.

While it’s important to stay hydrated, it’s also possible to drink too much water. This condition, known as **water intoxication** or hyponatremia, occurs when the balance of electrolytes in your body is disrupted by excessive water consumption. This is rare but can have serious health implications. To avoid this, it’s wise to drink water mindfully, focusing on your body’s signals rather than forcing yourself to meet arbitrary goals.

The science suggests another effective method to determine your water intake is to drink half your body weight (in pounds) in ounces. For example, if you weigh 160 pounds, aim for about 80 ounces of water per day. This method provides a more personalized approach to hydration.

Remember, other beverages like herbal tea and milk, as well as the moisture content from foods, contribute to your daily water intake. Therefore, while monitoring your water consumption, consider all sources of hydration.

Ultimately, staying hydrated is vital for maintaining good health. By observing your body's needs and adapting your water intake accordingly, you can ensure you’re drinking the right amount of water for your unique lifestyle. Prioritize hydration and pay attention to your body's signals to discover what works best for you.

Hydration Myths: Debunking Common Misconceptions
------------------------------------------------

When it comes to hydration, many people believe in common myths that can lead to confusion about how much water should be consumed. Understanding what is fact and what is fiction can greatly improve your health and hydration habits. Here, we will explore some of these misconceptions and highlight the truths behind proper hydration.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 1: You Need Eight Glasses of Water a Day

One of the most pervasive myths is that everyone needs to drink eight glasses of water daily to stay properly hydrated. However, this guideline is very general and might not apply to everyone. Individual hydration needs can vary widely based on factors such as:

- Age
- Sex
- Activity level
- Climate
- Overall health

Instead of counting glasses, listen to your body. Thirst is a reliable indicator of your need for water. Moreover, a variety of foods, especially fruits and vegetables, contribute to your daily hydration. Foods can account for around 20% of your total water intake.

### Myth 2: You Can Drink Too Much Water

While dehydration is a concern for many, overhydration can be an issue too, though it is relatively rare. Drinking excessive amounts of water in a short time can lead to a condition called hyponatremia, which dilutes the sodium in your blood. This can be dangerous and, in severe cases, may even lead to life-threatening situations. It's essential to balance your water intake and take your body's signals into account.

### Myth 3: Thirst Is a Sign of Dehydration

Many people believe that feeling thirsty means they are already dehydrated. While thirst can be an indicator of when you need water, by the time you feel thirsty, you might already be slightly dehydrated. Instead, aim to drink water throughout the day, particularly if you are active or in a hot environment.

### Myth 4: All Beverages Hydrate Equally

Some people think that any liquid is good for hydration, but this is not entirely true. While beverages like water, herbal teas, and even coffee can keep you hydrated, sugary drinks, sodas, and alcohol can have a diuretic effect. Instead of promoting hydration, these can lead to increased urine output and potential dehydration. It’s wise to choose water as your primary hydration source.

### Myth 5: You Only Need to Hydrate During Exercise

This misconception can lead to inadequate hydration. While it's crucial to drink water during and after physical activity, your body requires hydration every day. It’s essential to maintain a balanced water intake regardless of your activity level. Aim to drink water throughout your day to keep your body functions operating well.

### Myth 6: Sports Drinks Are Always Better Than Water

While sports drinks are designed to provide hydration, electrolytes, and carbohydrates during intense workouts, they are not necessary for everyone. For regular activities or casual exercise, water should suffice. Consuming sports drinks excessively can add unnecessary sugars and calories to your diet. Consider your activity level and needs, and let that guide your choice between water and sports drinks.

### Myth 7: All Water Is Equal

The notion that all water is identical is inaccurate. While tap water, bottled water, and filtered water generally hydrate you, they can differ in terms of mineral content and quality. For instance:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Tap Water:** Often treated with chlorine and fluoride, it's generally safe but may contain impurities depending on the location.
- **Bottled Water:** It can vary in mineral content and often comes from springs or sources that may not be as regulated as tap water.
- **Filtered Water:** This often removes chemicals and improves taste, but it’s important to choose a good filtration system.

The key takeaway is that understanding the truths about hydration can help you make informed choices. Instead of relying on myths, focus on how your body feels and adjust your water intake accordingly. By debunking these myths, you can improve your health and maintain optimal hydration for your individual needs.

The Role of Water in Body Function and Performance
--------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for survival, impacting nearly every function within the body. Understanding the role of water in our daily lives can greatly enhance not only our health but also our physical performance. It's fascinating to explore how much of our body is made up of water—about 60%! This high percentage underscores the importance of staying adequately hydrated.

### Maintaining Body Temperature

One of water's primary roles is thermoregulation, which is the process of maintaining a stable body temperature. When you exercise or are exposed to heat, your body sweats to cool down. The sweat evaporates, taking heat away from your skin. This process hinges on having enough water in your body. If you're dehydrated, your ability to sweat declines, leading to overheating.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Supporting Cellular Function

Every cell in your body relies on water to function correctly. Water acts as a solvent, allowing nutrients and waste products to move in and out of cells efficiently. This transportation system is vital for cellular metabolism. If you aren't drinking enough water, your cells can become sluggish, hindering overall function.

### The Importance of Nutrient Transport

Your body requires various nutrients to perform optimally. Water helps transport these nutrients from the digestive system to the body’s cells. This includes vitamins, minerals, and amino acids, which are inherently important for bodily functions such as muscle repair and growth. Here are a few vital nutrients transported through water:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Electrolytes
- Glucose
- Proteins
- Hormones

Without sufficient hydration, these nutrients may not be delivered effectively, leading to fatigue and decreased performance during physical activities.

### Aiding Digestion

Water is crucial for digestion and overall gut health. It helps break down food and dissolve nutrients, making them accessible to the body. Insufficient water intake can lead to digestive complications like constipation. Keeping hydrated not only supports regular bowel movements but also helps prevent kidney stones and urinary tract infections.

### Enhancing Physical Performance

For those who engage in physical activity, drinking enough water is vital. Dehydration can lead to a variety of performance issues, including:

- Decreased endurance
- Increased fatigue
- Reduced coordination
- Cramping

Studies have shown that even a 2% loss of body weight through sweating can impair athletic performance. To optimize your workouts or sporting events, ensure you're well-hydrated before, during, and after exercise.

### Boosting Cognitive Function

Your brain is significantly impacted by hydration levels as well. Water consumption is linked to improved concentration, mood stability, and overall cognitive function. When you're dehydrated, you might experience mental fatigue, headaches, and reduced short-term memory capacity. Staying hydrated not only keeps you physically energized but also sharpens your mental acuity.

### Developing a Personal Hydration Plan

It's essential to personalize your water intake based on your lifestyle and individual needs. While general recommendations suggest around 8-10 glasses a day, factors such as age, sex, physical activity, and climate can influence this number. Here are some tips to help you stay hydrated:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Carry a water bottle wherever you go.
- Set reminders on your phone to drink water regularly.
- Incorporate water-rich foods like fruits and vegetables into your diet.
- Listen to your body, and drink when you're thirsty.

These simple strategies can help ensure that you're meeting your hydration needs effectively.

Ultimately, water is a cornerstone of bodily function and performance. Whether you're exercising, working, or enjoying downtime, maintaining adequate hydration is crucial. By recognizing the critical role water plays in your body, you can make more informed decisions regarding your daily intake and overall health.

Factors That Influence Your Daily Water Needs
---------------------------------------------

Understanding how much water you should drink daily is influenced by several important factors. Your personal daily water needs can vary based on lifestyle, environmental conditions, and individual health factors. Here, we explore these influences in detail to help you gauge your optimal water intake.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Body Weight and Size

Your weight directly affects how much water you need. Generally, a good rule of thumb is to take your weight in pounds, divide it by two, and drink that number in ounces. For example, if you weigh 160 pounds, you would aim for about 80 ounces of water daily. Larger individuals typically require more water than smaller ones. Therefore, consider your body size when calculating your hydration needs.

### Physical Activity Level

If you lead an active lifestyle, you will require additional water. During exercise, your body sweats to regulate temperature, losing fluids in the process. Here are key points to remember about hydration during physical activity:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- For moderate exercise, add 1.5 to 2.5 cups of water.
- For intense workouts lasting over an hour, consider hydration drinks that replace electrolytes.

Always drink water before, during, and after exercising to maintain hydration levels.

### Climate and Temperature

The weather can significantly influence your water needs. Hot and humid conditions increase perspiration, which means you lose more fluids. If you live in a hot climate or are traveling to a warm destination, increase your water intake accordingly. Similarly, high altitudes can also lead to dehydration, so make sure to hydrate more if you're in elevated regions.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Dietary Choices

Your diet plays a crucial role in determining how much water you should drink. Foods high in sodium or sugar can require more water to help your body process them. Consider these factors:

- High salt foods increase thirst and require more water.
- Protein-rich diets may also need additional hydration for proper metabolism.
- Fruits and vegetables have high water content and can help meet your fluid needs.

Be mindful of your food choices and adjust your water intake based on your diet.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Health Conditions

Specific health conditions can dictate how much water you should drink. For instance:

- Conditions like diabetes and kidney issues often require increased fluid intake.
- Fever can lead to increased fluid loss, raising hydration needs.
- Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding require more water, approximately 10 cups daily.

It's vital to consult a healthcare professional if you have health concerns that affect your hydration requirements.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Age and Gender

Your age and gender may also dictate your hydration needs. Generally, women need about 2.2 liters a day, while men require approximately 3 liters. As you age, your body may also have a reduced sensation of thirst, putting older adults at risk of dehydration. Be proactive in monitoring fluid intake to prevent health issues associated with dehydration.

### Personal Preferences and Culture

Everyone has individual hydration preferences influenced by culture and habits. For example, some people may prefer tea or flavored water instead of plain water. While these can contribute to overall hydration, it's essential to ensure your intake meets your individual needs. If you enjoy herbal teas or hydrating juices, include them in your daily fluid tally!

Staying adequately hydrated is not a one-size-fits-all scenario. Consider your body weight, activity level, climate, dietary habits, health conditions, age, and personal preferences when determining how much water you should drink daily. Finding the right balance in hydration can enhance your overall well-being and keep your body functioning optimally.

Practical Tips for Staying Hydrated Throughout the Day

- **Sticky Notes:** Place sticky notes on your fridge or computer to remind you to hydrate.
- **Social Cues:** Ask friends or family to remind you or join you in drinking water.

### Incorporate Water-Rich Foods

You don't have to rely solely on fluids for your hydration needs. Many fruits and vegetables have high water content. Including these in your diet can significantly contribute to your daily intake. Consider adding:

- **Watermelon:** This juicy fruit is about 92% water.
- **Strawberries:** They are sweet, delicious, and about 91% water.
- **Cucumbers:** Very refreshing and contain about 95% water.
- **Spinach:** Loaded with vitamins and about 91% water.

### Drink Before You're Thirsty

By the time you feel thirsty, your body may already be experiencing mild dehydration. To prevent this, make it a habit to drink consistently throughout the day. Carry a water bottle with you wherever you go and take sips regularly.

### Flavor Your Water

If plain water doesn’t excite you, try adding a splash of flavor. Here are a few ideas:

- **Use Fruits:** Add lemon, lime, berries, or cucumber slices to your water.
- **Herbs:** Fresh mint or basil can enhance the flavor without adding calories.
- **Infused Water:** Create your own infused water by soaking fruits and herbs in a pitcher overnight.

### Make It Part of Your Routine

Hydration into your daily routine can make it feel less like a chore. Consider these tips:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Hello Mornings:** Start your day with a glass of water before breakfast.
- **Pair Meals with Water:** Drink a glass of water before or during each meal.
- **Wind Down:** Have a small glass of water before going to bed.

### Stay Mindful During Exercise

When you exercise, your body loses fluids through sweat. This means you need to be particularly careful about hydration during physical activity. Keep a water bottle handy and take sips throughout your workout. Aim to drink water both before and after exercising to fully replenish lost fluids.

### Listen to Your Body

As you work on staying hydrated, pay attention to how your body responds. Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, fatigue, and dark yellow urine. If you notice these symptoms, increase your water intake immediately.

I am male and 35 years old. I'm together with my girlfriend for 34 years. We own a flat together and live together. I like her but our communication with each other is not very deep, we don't have a lot to tell each other. Actually it feels more like we live with each other but that's it. My girlfriend is quite happy with the relationship - I'm not so much. I like her for everything that she does and how I feel safe with her. But when she tells me she loves me it's really hard for me to answer the same. Sex is very rare, maybe once every six weeks, and only initiated by me (that's already the case since around 6 months in the relationship). The quality of sex isn't that good either.
Again, I really like her and how she is but some things are missing.

Six months ago I met a woman, 6 years younger than me. And the chaos for me started. We just met as part of our jobs. She knew I had a girlfriend, so it stayed on a neutral way.
After a few weeks, I guess we both felt that we develop feelings for each other. We stopped seeing each other, even for professional reasons. It felt horrible to me. After a while we met again and felt like magnets. Nothing happened except for honest talks from both sides. She told me she wants to be with me and that I shall commit to her. I just couldn't, I didn't have the balls to leave my girlfriend. I told this other woman that I can't right now, I'm not feeling mentally in a state to take that decision. I don't know why but I felt horrible and wanted to take her out for a dinner - I looked for a restaurant (a bit more expensive but not crazily expensive). She was upset about the choice and told me that she had hoped for a romantic dinner in a fancy restaurant to at least feel a bit of commitment from my side. I then canceled everything as I realised I shouldn't take her out in general and I also didn't like this behaviour. I suddenly realised that she also told me that she wants ""the highest earner in a relationship to pay the majority or all of the rent"" and the man to pay vacations.

After that, I was at least a bit more okay to not date her. I was telling my girlfriend what happened and about my feelings towards this woman.

After a while I met this woman just randomly walking on the streets. She asked me for a coffee. She told me then in tears that she misses seeing me. I told her I miss her too but we shouldn't have contact - she blocked me then everywhere. 
And since then my world is upside down. Despite seeing a therapist, I'm really really struggling. I'm simply unhappy to be in this situation. I really feel that I love this woman, I miss her, I absolutely adore her eyes and looks.

At the same time, I know that my girlfriend is just so good to me, she doesn't care about money. I'm wondering each day why I can't just be happy with her. I try to force myself to be happy with her. I know I could marry her and she would do everything to stay with me, to work on challenges and to foster a relationship.

Despite us also going together to a couple therapist, we just don't seem to manage to improve our love life. The communication together is still not very deep and especially in different kind of humours (she's very serious by nature, I'm more the childish jokes guy).

Has anyone ever been in such a situation?
I wake up at night and think I have a decision to break up with my girlfriend and try to contact the other woman again. The next day I feel I want to try to improve the relationship.
I just feel that I will hate my decision, no matter what I do. ",2,1734902761.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

I’m looking to start investing a few bob in ETFs via Trade Republic and was wondering if I could get people’s thoughts or advice on the strategy. Based on my financial situation, at this point the goal would be to simply build wealth through investing, and at some point down the line, draw down for the family to enjoy. The following is my current financial set up:
 
€30,000 in a PTSB current account. This is where I get paid and pay all major bills.
€15,000 in CU as an emergency fund. I add €100 to this every month
€16,500 in trade republic for the 3% interest.
€126,000 left on Mortgage
I’m 37 now and only started a private pension last year.
 
I’m currently married with 2 kids under 5. Overpaying the mortgage per month and its on track to be cleared in 6 years. I max out payments to my private pension via Cornmarket albeit with no employer match. My monthly income is roughly 4000 after tax per month.
 
I’ve followed the almighty flowchart for some time and am finally at a point where I still have ~500 savings after all bills etc (this seems like very little, but my wife is currently part-time so I cover the mortgage of 2200 per month plus 200 on house bills, I add 100 to my own and my children’s CU accounts, and pay 150 into  my own and two children’s Zurich accounts. Add in petrol, phone credit, coffees etc). This is my left-over money to play with for the next 2 years or so until both kids are in primary school.
 
Ok, brass tax, I’ve been considering using the €500 leftover to invest in the following (as described in TR):
 
S&P 500 EUR (Acc)
FTSE All-World USD (Acc)
Core MSCI World USD (Acc)
 
I’m thinking of putting 500 into one of those each month for the foreseeable future, alternating which one per month. Does this strategy make any sense? Would people recommend these ETFs?
 
I’m finally in a position where I can invest comfortably, and even with the exit tax and deemed disposal, I’m happy to at least have given it a go. I can track each payment in excel as I go. I’m also happy to keep this up for at least the next 10 years.
 
When it comes to the 8-year mark, is the DD applied to the sum ‘profit’ per ETF, or do you have to somehow work out how much each monthly instalment has made?
 
Also, since some of these ETFs are USD, outside of conversion fees and the usual exit/DD, are there other fees etc one needs to worry about buying non-European ETFs? What would you folks do in my position?",1,1734902577.0,irishpersonalfinance,1,1.0,False
1hk81gc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hk81gc,AIO for thinking she was on a slippery slope with a coworker?,"My (38M) wife (34F) and I recently had a blowup and amidst that, she agreed I could check her messages with a coworker whom I suspected had a thing for her and that she was starting to reciprocate.

Background:
In recent years we’ve had a more explorative-relationship. My wife is beautiful and one of my kinks is the attention she gets from others. Examples would be in Vegas I enjoy her getting drinks from males/females, picking  random nerdy guys for dinner dates, and so on. After the fact it’s always very vanilla and she bails on them, it’s kind of a fun game we play, and I’m usually in physical proximity somewhere. We’ve even had a 3some with her best BFF but regardless of how we’ve gone about it, (except in this situation) there had always been zero jealousy or misunderstanding because we communicated clear boundaries and expectations, and had frequent communication throughout these other instances.

Several years ago she had a coworker she insisted was an office nuisance, but would consistently go out of his way to buy (female) staff coffee, snacks, etc. My wife’s BFF (same girl above) worked with them too and would agree he was annoyingly persistent, but that he would indeed do that for the female staff. Both agreed it wasn’t a bad deal to get the Starbucks perks so I laughed along with them and told her that was fine be me if he wanted to simp that hard with nothing in return.

Fast forward a year after she left his workplace and got a new job. Somehow in a conversation with friends the subject of etiquette on how to act with the opposite sex at work came about. She was adamant things like coffee, small gifts, going to lunch, etc were all inappropriate things and if she is ever hit on as a female, she tells men her boundaries and it’s a full-stop. I laughed because it seem really regurgitated and produced, and mentioned her simp who would buy her coffee near daily (which was green-flagged for us both) as a  instance where it can be harmless and funny. She became really awkward and said “it was only 3-4 times ever”, which was more like the weekly trend and I found it odd  because I endorsed it as did she under the premise described. Later when we got home, I asked why she wasn’t forthcoming about it because it was harmless fun and she said she had a poor memory as to how much it would happen. This made me raise an eyebrow and was the first time I questioned it.

In a random conversation with her BFF “Sandra” shortly after, “Bill” came up again and the subject of how he paid for their dinners at a work-related party when all 3 of them were still employed together came up. Again my wife said “she didn’t remember that” and while that in itself didn’t raise an alarm with me, her behavior did and gave me suspicion.

I began to ask her why she was so awkward and seemed to have a hard time recollecting how often Bill would treat her to coffee, or dinner, or whatever it may be- I then asked if there was ever anything else he offered and she was adamant there wasn’t and became frustrated with me. To be clear, the instances weren’t as much as a red flag as were her angry and flustered emotions when I genuinely asked.

During a recent blowup I checked an old phone of hers with her permission because her responses to my questions about Bill were highly unusual for her, especially because I was ok with the context in which she said they interacted: it was infrequent, he was ugly, annoying and she couldn’t stand him but yet was defensive. So several times I tried to get clarity but her anger always made me wonder.

I’ve attached some of the messages I found. She claimed they never went to lunch together, she was generally mean to him and they never conversed as friends. Even with evidence he would treat her to lunch frequently she still denied it, and said it didn’t happen or “if it did I can’t remember”.

Clearly she wasn’t mean- while she isn’t actively returning flirtatious vibes I also feel she did nothing to shut it down. There were also deleted messages where I could clearly decipher he had sent pics, and she would erase them. One such instance he said “how do you like my tats” and she responded “you look like _______” which indicated it was a shirtless pic, which she felt the need to erase. He also made plans with her to go out to bars on weekends which it seems she was ok with but never (to my knowledge) followed through and she bailed on him. Also all their messages to a certain point were deleted and they currently have no connections on social media making wonder if there was a fallout (some of their picture messages show them finding each other’s Ig profiles online). She would send him her AM workouts. Again nothing overtly bad but I don’t know why she’s so amnesiac regarding Bill.

AIO? I totally get I’m partially responsible for the game I/we play but I’m very convinced I would’ve been ok with most of the above had she communicated with me. The lying when it wasn’t really necessary is what makes me question. Something about a guy saying, in gist “I f’d your friend and not you” means to me anyway “I could if I wanted” and with her lol’ing it off seems the opposite of her full-stops she claims in these situations.

--------------------------------------------------------

Have you ever wondered how to turn a simple pie into something truly extraordinary that could be worth a million dollars? The secret lies not just in the ingredients, but in the passion, creativity, and flavors that come together to form the perfect pie. Here’s an exploration into crafting that million-dollar pie, making it an unforgettable dessert that leaves a lasting impression.

The foundational element of any exceptional pie is the crust. A flaky, buttery crust can make or break your pie. Here’s how to craft the perfect crust:

- **Use cold ingredients:** Keep your butter and water chilled. This is crucial for achieving a flaky texture.
- **Don’t over-knead:** Mix the dough just until combined. Overworking can lead to tough crusts.
- **Chill your dough:** After mixing, wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour.

Once you have your crust ready, it’s time to think about the filling. A million-dollar pie often has a unique twist on classic flavors. Here are a few ideas:

- **Exotic fruits:** Consider combining traditional fruits like apples with unexpected ingredients like cardamom or star anise for a flavor boost.
- **Decadent chocolates:** A rich chocolate filling made from high-quality dark chocolate can elevate your pie substantially. Mixing in a hint of sea salt can take your flavor profile to another level.
- **Herbs and spices:** Integrating fresh herbs like mint or basil can add a refreshing twist that surprises the palate.

After choosing your filling, it’s essential to focus on balancing flavors. The key is to harmonize sweetness with acidity. If your pie is too sweet, consider adding a touch of citrus, like lemon juice or zest, to brighten the flavors. This balance creates a pie that tantalizes the taste buds.

Baking is where the magic happens. Here are some essential tips for baking your million-dollar pie:

- **Preheat your oven:** Ensure the oven is at the right temperature before placing your pie inside. This helps in achieving an even bake and a perfectly browned crust.
- **Use a pie protector:** To prevent over-browning of the crust edges, use a pie shield or cover the edges with aluminum foil.
- **Know when it’s done:** The filling should be bubbly and the crust golden brown. Don’t just rely on time; look for visual cues.

Once your pie is baked to perfection, presentation is key. A beautiful pie beckons people to take a slice. Here are some ways to enhance your pie’s visual appeal:

- **A beautiful golden crust:** Brush the crust with an egg wash for that perfect shine.
- **Garnishes:** Fresh whipped cream or ice cream can make a delicious pairing. Consider adding a sprig of mint for a fresh look.
- **Serve with style:** Use a decorative pie dish and serve on a lovely platter. A little effort goes a long way in making your pie look as great as it tastes.

Remember that storytelling is an essential part of making your pie feel special. Share the inspiration behind your pie, the local ingredients you used, or a family recipe twist. When people connect emotionally with your pie, they’re more likely to remember it—and you.

To wrap it up, making a million-dollar pie is as much about the techniques as it is about creativity and presentation. By focusing on quality ingredients, unique flavor combinations, and thoughtful baking, you can create a pie that's truly extraordinary. So, roll up your sleeves and start crafting your own million-dollar pie today! You never know where that first slice might take you.

Creative Marketing Strategies for Selling High-Value Pies
---------------------------------------------------------

To sell high-value pies, creative marketing strategies can truly make a difference. By thinking outside the box, you can capture customers' attention and boost sales. Here are several effective methods to achieve that.

### Leverage Storytelling

People connect with stories, so use this to your advantage. Share the journey of how your pies are made, from sourcing local ingredients to the baking process. Highlight the effort and love that goes into each pie, creating an emotional connection with your customers. Consider using social media to showcase behind-the-scenes videos or even customer testimonials that reflect their experiences enjoying your pies.

Check The Details Here: https://billionairebrainwave.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Create Limited-Edition Flavors

Introducing seasonal or limited-edition flavors can drive urgency and excitement. Think about unique combinations or ingredients that reflect specific holidays or local traditions. For example, a pumpkin spice pie in fall or a fresh berry pie in summer can appeal to your audience’s craving for novelty. Promote these exclusive pies through your website and across your social media channels to generate buzz.

### Collaborate with Local Businesses

Partnering with local coffee shops, restaurants, or even wineries can help you reach new customers. By featuring your pies in their menu or collaborating on special events, you can tap into their existing customer base. Consider creating a pie-pairing event where guests can enjoy both your pies and their specialty beverages. Such collaborations can also lead to co-marketing opportunities, expanding your visibility.

### Offer Pie Subscription Services

A pie subscription service ensures a regular income stream and keeps your customers excited about your products. Allow customers to choose a monthly plan with different pie flavors. This not only keeps them engaged but also allows you to build loyalty over time. Make sure to promote the benefits, such as convenience and a unique experience delivered right to their door.

### Utilize Social Media Marketing

Social media platforms are powerful tools for reaching your target audience. Share enticing images of your high-value pies on Instagram or Facebook, showcasing their textures and flavors. Engage your audience with interactive content, such as polls to decide on new flavors or contests where they can win a free pie by sharing their own pie experiences. Hashtags like #HighValuePies can help increase your visibility in search engines as well.

### Host Pie-Tasting Events

Organizing pie-tasting events can be a fantastic way to introduce your products to potential customers. These events allow customers to sample a variety of pies, helping them discover their favorites. Consider creating a festive atmosphere with decorations and live music. Offering discounts for purchasers at the event can also encourage sales while creating a memorable experience.

### Optimize Your Online Presence

In today’s digital age, having a well-optimized website is crucial. Make sure your site showcases your high-value pies with captivating descriptions and high-resolution images. Include an easy-to-navigate shopping cart and ensure your site is mobile-friendly. Additionally, consider adding a blog where you can share recipes, pie-making tips, or the health benefits of your ingredients, boosting both SEO and customer engagement.

### Utilize Email Marketing

Email marketing remains a highly effective way to communicate with your audience. Build a subscriber list by encouraging customers to sign up for your newsletter via your website. Regularly send out emails highlighting new flavors, special promotions, and event invitations. Make these emails visually appealing with images of your pies and clear calls to action.

### Engage with Food Influencers

Collaborate with food bloggers or social media influencers in your community. They can help spread the word about your high-value pies through authentic reviews. Offer them free samples in exchange for posts or mentions, and encourage them to tag your business on their platforms. This can significantly increase your visibility and persuade potential customers to try your pies.

By utilizing these creative marketing strategies, you can effectively promote your high-value pies, attract a broader audience, and significantly boost your sales. As you implement these ideas, remember to remain true to your unique brand voice and connect with your customers in a meaningful way.

### Conclusion

Creating a million-dollar pie isn’t just about the ingredients; it's about weaving together a story, building a brand, and connecting with your audience. The secret recipe is a fusion of high-quality components, unique flavors, and, most importantly, the passion behind the creation. Once you have perfected your recipe, the next step is to implement creative marketing strategies that elevate your pie from just another dessert to a coveted delicacy.

Engaging your audience through storytelling and visually appealing content can make a significant difference. Social media platforms are an excellent venue to showcase your pie, allowing you to reach potential customers and generate buzz. Collaborating with local influencers or participating in community events can also help create excitement around your brand. Offering limited-edition flavors or seasonal specials can spur customer interest, drawing in those eager to get a taste of something unique.

I’m really interested in hearing stories from those of you who were diagnosed around 30 or later. 

I really, really suspect that I have ADHD or ADD. 
My story short: 34 year old woman, I have a masters degree and a really good job. I’m currently not working full time due to stress and anxiety - again. This is the fourth or fifth time in six years that I suffer from these things. The last year, I have struggled a lot after my dad past away after 10 years of illness and I suffered from a serious knee injury and a very long rehab. 

But actually, I think I started to suffer a lot when I went from a job with night and morning shifts, a lot of structure with clear roles and a lot of short deadlines as a news journalist. I started a new 9-5 job - still as a journalist - but with longer deadlines and looser structure. 

So my things are:
- I’m not able to concentrate for more than like 10-15 minutes at a time. Then I need to get coffee, pee, smoke. But in that 10-15 minutes I can do what other people do in half a work day. 
- I “forget” friends, when I’m no longer in “natural” contact with them - like if we don’t go to uni, work or do sports regularly, I just dont manage to plan a “date” with them. 
- I always attract (and are attracted to) men in some sort of a midlife crisis or are narcissists. My longest relationship has been a year. It’s not that I dont want it - I love to be in a relationship. 
- I feel like I spend more time planning what to do and in what order to do things in than I actually spend on doing those things
- If I need to say something during a meeting, I have to say it immediately or else I forget it
- I don’t have a count on how many times I have said “Sorry, I forgot to listen”
- When in high school, my teachers notes were always that I was bright but I disturbed myself and others
- If I’m genuinely interested in something, I’m really good at it. If I dont get the point immediately, I couldnt care less about it. 
- I have a restless feeling like I need to be working towards something or going somewhere all the time. 
- If I have long term projects, I often start out with being really eager to do it, and then the interests just goes down. I managed to do my master thesis and finish with an A, but I actually dont think I read the entire paper in its whole before handing it in. 
- I really, really dont get how people can enjoy a 9-5 job. Like, you meet in at the same time and go home at the same time, then the day is almost gone, you eat dinner and go to bed, and in the weekends you are tired and tries to do all the things you didnt do during the week. How is that enjoyable?
- I get so easily distracted by noises. I have to listen to music while biking to not get overwhelmed. 
- I daydream a lot. 
- I’m really, really selective. Regarding people, jobs, interests, conversations, clothes. Anything really.

I love salmiakki (my favourites are the fish-shaped ones), I love joulutorttut, I love your language (I put a lot of time and effort to learn it throughout the semester and I want to keep learning it afterwards until I'm fluent), I love ice-hockey, swimming in lakes, sausages, bulk candies (omg your candies are so awesome), drinking coffee and milk all the time, introverted attitude as the basic form of respect (not having to greet strangers all the time is so great), sauna, liquorice everywhere, and so many other things. I enjoyed your music, your forests, your lakes, your safety, your food, your weather...

So every day I was rolling out of bed (with much disdain) and having breakfast with a cup of black or green tea plus polyphenols, which are green tea. 

I started noticing my existing restless legs syndrome gets very bad and I’m getting acute tachycardia different from my autoimmune dysautonomia. My under eye area also became fully *purple.* I mean to the point people at work thought I had a black eye. My fatigue got even worse.

Lo and behold, my ferritin levels dropped from 45 to 16 within a few months of having 1-2 cups of tea a day with the polyphenols.

I found out the hard way that you are supposed to **consume any caffeinated tea or coffee 1-2 hours apart from food if it’s plant based (non-heme) iron such as spinach**. My levels are so low I now need to see a hematologist for infusions. Yes, my gut is better, but *my other existing symptoms like neuropathy are worse. My period is also delayed now because my iron is so low.*

We’ve had our rescue dog for 4 years, and he’s known my parents for most of that time. He’s stayed with them multiple times, sometimes for up to 3 weeks, and we’ve even gone on vacations together where he shared the back seat with them.  

He’s a terrier mix with some Australian Shepherd and Hungarian Mudi in him (about 50%), so I figure a lot of his barking comes from his breed traits.  

Right now, we’re visiting my parents for the holidays, and every morning, he wakes me up at 7 or 8 AM crying because he can’t wait to go upstairs and greet them. He always makes a beeline for my dad, who’s having his morning coffee, but then spends most of the day following my mom around—probably because she’s the one feeding him while we’re here.  

Here’s the problem: he has this really uncomfortable habit of jumping up and barking at my dad, almost like he’s trying to “herd” him. My dad stays calm and doesn’t seem to mind, but I find it so embarrassing—especially because they’ll be watching him for 10 days starting Thursday.  

Just now, for example, we were sitting on the sofa while my dad was watching TV. I was half-asleep when my dad got up to grab something from the kitchen, and out of nowhere, my dog jumped up and barked loudly right in his face. I’m like—HELLO, you know him!  

I don’t even know what I’m asking here. Sometimes I worry he might snap. My sister also lives in the house with her kids (on a different floor), and anytime they come upstairs, I put my dog in my room because I just don’t trust him around kids and their unpredictable movements.  

I tried telling him a firm NO as I have seen some online trainers do but he just looks at me and barks even louder.

As time went by, they moved away and so we got to see each other less and less.
But nonetheless we texted every now and then and got together maybe every 2 months or so.
We never texted daily or even frequently. She brought by some stuff when I got ill (while she was still in the area) and I always bought them a thoughtful bday present and was under the impression that even if we can't find time to get together often, we still remained good friends.

Last time we got together was the first time I really got offended. She was in the city center where I live and invited me to coffee. When we were saying our goodbyes, I lightly commented on hopping we can find some time sooner next time (it has been a while since we saw eachother) and then she said she had the time for this coffee because some other friend stood her up... That really hit me in the guts. I guess she never meant to get together with me until some other friend had a change in plans and so she had spare time for me. I mean why did she have to tell me that at all? :( I was hurt and offended, but I thought maybe it sliped out of her unintentionally- it probably did, she probably didn't hurt me on purpous, but still, I got a better insight on our friendship from her perspective - and I tought we were closer than that.

Second thing happened yesterday, she texted me after some time asking how I was and for my current address. I told her I was ""so so.."" (dealing with a health scare with a family member atm) and gave my address and also asked for hers since she moved in with her boyfriend about a year ago, and I didn't have it.
She then casually wrote her Name Surname, Address.
And behold, her surname has changed.
It was like a stab in the heart - she got married and never cared to inform me?? And now does so in such a maner?..
I felt so hurt I actually cried over it a bit and felt like shit for the rest of the evening. I just felt our bond was stronger even tho we moved apart, I mean this is a big deal in someone's life, isn't it? You usually tell your friends? It made me feel like an acquaintance..
Then she asks if my sister is still a travel agent and if she could look up a destination for her.
I only responded ""she will check"" without commenting on the surname.
She then said thaank yoou and asked how I was again and said ""oh yeah, and I got married in september"".
She never bothered replying to my first reply to how I was (so, so..), and at this point I don't even feel like sharing such a delicate matter with her anymore.
I really don't know how to reply to her last messages or how to comment on the getting married part.

I guess I've already answered my question - I guess I felt a deeper friendship than they did.

And to add - I am also female and straight, so it was purely about friendship

But we do struggle with issues where I feel so unseen. I feel like he doesn’t respect me and my world views as a person. I don’t feel like he’s interested in the things I have to say. 

He’s a very masculine man, prides himself in being a leader and im more softer and need to be seen. I don’t like to step up to be heard etc. I prefer being listened to, asked questions. I’m a really philosophical person and so is my husband. It’s the thing that bought us together. 

But recently his job became demanding and most of our conversations are about his job, his days, his fitness. I don’t feel like he is interested in my days. 

I’ve already communicated this to him multiple times, which has always resulted in misunderstandings and miscommunications because he takes my concerns as me judging him or not appreciating him. The fact that I feel a lack makes him feel like he’s not a good enough husband so he becomes defensive. I’ve told him this many times but it’s like he never listens. 

I’m 8 months pregnant with twins, I do everything around the house and sometimes I just want him to bring me a nice gift home, or bring me a breakfast in bed or coffee, or plan a date. He does these things sometimes but I wish it was more frequent. 

I don’t see him enough as he works so much and goes gym 5-6 x a week. 

I started doing my own thing finding my own hobbies etc but the more I have my own life outside the marriage the more I’m “checking out” emotionally. I’m at a stage where I don’t even want to give attention or affection anymore because I feel so alone and scared of getting hurt like I don’t trust him anymore. I don’t know if it’s pregnancy hormones but I wish things were the same as they were. 

I just want my best friend back. 

Has anyone gone through a similar patch and gotten out alive. I need hope right now. ",7,1734901224.0,MuslimMarriage,2,0.82,False

I do the cleaning, cooking, laundry, basically anything that needs to be done I try to do. I don't put so much pressure on cleaning though, i consider myself a chill person and we should enjoy the space we live in. However, my husband has some issues with cleaning after him/tiding when he has a day off. I requested him to put at least his dish in the sink after eating, or putting the toys away after playing with our daughter, I consider these basic stuff. He is very irritated by my requests. He is a wonderful husband and does a lot for us, but sometimes I feel I constantly have to put things into order. I haven't had a single day off, even sundays, after giving birth. I have to constantly do something.

1hk7du4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1hk7du4/aio_husband_buying_me_xmas_gifts_i_dont_want/,AIO husband buying me Xmas gifts I don't want ,"How my husband treats me has always made me doubt that he cares. He says horrible things in arguments which he claims he doesn't mean, but repeats over and over again. He is indifferent and invalidates my emotions constantly, and is quick to insult me if I get upset with him. He doesn't have proper conversations with me but will with others. I strongly suspect he's cheated and more than once. He's engaged in a lot of suspicious activity often times indicative of cheating. He does things that make me feel disrespected almost on a daily. He makes agreements but always goes back on them or tries to. He makes me out to be the problem, blaming me for all of our arguments. Though he starts and/or escalates many of them and never apologizes. He slanders me to his mother but hates me talking to anyone, even chatgbt. And yet he expects apologies from me for the same behaviors. 

We are on a trip home visiting my family. He made agreements before coming. One was to get up and out early most days to make the most of the time, something that tends to be difficult for him. He asked me what time and I said 9:30/10:30am which he agreed to, and said was reasonable. That we shouldn't be waking up any later. To my surprise he was good with sticking to the time during the last trip. We agreed on a time before going to bed and he set his alarm, and got up within five or ten minutes of it going off. Later on in the trip he struggled a bit getting up late and leaving late, which in turn left us out late. He complained about it saying he wanted to get back earlier. I said we needed to leave earlier to be able to do that. He couldn't seem to make the connection. 

I worried he wouldn't be able to get up early this time around. At home he was sleeping to 2pm or later. I pointed this out and he said he was at home, not in America, as if he was going to suddenly have no sleeping problems here. Or he was going to prioritize getting up. Then we got here and the first several days I got up at 9:30am and struggled to get him up. We didn't have but a few weeks to visit family members before leaving to another state. I started getting upset, complaning about him not sticking to his agreement. He said that I was berating him. We were leaving late and getting back late. He complained about that and said that I wasn't upholding my end of the agreement, when it relied on him upholding his. But he always holds me to my agreements, even if he can't be held to his. 

He asked to sleep to 10am most days and I agreed so long as he got and ready quickly, but he didn't. He told me he would dial back the time each day and he didn't do that either. He wouldn't set any alarms relying on me to do so. He didn't seem to care that I was disappointed and stressed out. He said that it would be different once we got to my mother's in Arizona. When we got here we slept to 12pm the first few days and left late. I didn't mind it because he had driven here, I knew that he was tired. I thought that he would get up earlier after he caught up on his rest. He told me that I needed to wake him up 15mins earlier than the time I wanted him up. I did that and it didn't work. It started to feel like a waste of my time. 

He's done things here which have made me suspicious of him. He started to become distant, to avoid affection. He didn't want me touching him, and didn't want me to touch him. He blamed the arguments we were having, though many of them were caused by his going back on agreements and disrespect. I have questioned if he's attracted to me for a long time, particularly after he started putting me down over my weight gain in arguments. He also looked at other women in front of me. I was questioning his attraction due to several things, including the lack of intimacy, and he said just because he's not interested in sex doesn't mean that he is cheating. But that is what most women assume when a man doesn't want it.

We were out one day shopping with my mother and he disappeared on me, something he's done before. He came back in and claimed he lost me. That he went outside thinking I had, and then waited on me out there. He didn't look for my mother. He didn't call or text me. I found it odd. He started taking his phone with him more, and into the bathroom something he's also done before. When questioned he said he can take it where he wants. I got a new phone case and he requested to clean my phone and put it on. I left it with him and he snooped instead. Again something he's done many times, usually when he seems to be up to something. 

Afterwards, he sat beside me on the sofa trying to find something to do that day. I noticed him google the zoo. I said minutes later I wasn't interested in the zoo. He looked at me with a wide eyed, nervous expression asking me if I had gone through his search history. I said I hadn't but what would be the problem if I did, that he had just snooped through my phone. He said that it would feel weird because I question and accuse him so much. He justifies doing it to me, having done it long before I ever did, because he makes it out that I am the untrustworthy one. If I went over all I've done in comparison to what he's done, no one would think I'm cheating. He's said before that he knows I haven't. He also goes long periods without looking at my phone so I don't think he's actually worried. 

In between all of that he started an argument by gaslighting me. He then stormed off in the rental car and ignored my calls/texts for an hour. I figured he did this to be able to meet up with someone. He then started looking at Xmas gifts, or so he claimed. He was glued to his phone for hours. He tilted it away from me as he was using it. When I looked in his direction he gave me an annoyed look. The next day he asked me questions about what I wanted, acting like he had no idea. When I've told him or have at least given him options. He also knows what I like. He said he had ordered two gifts, and wasn't sure of one of them. For the amount of time he was spending on his phone supposedly looking at gifts, I found it strange he only had two ordered. 

I mentioned things I had mentioned to him and he hadn't ordered any of them. He then sat in the car for upwards on an hour on his phone. When we had plans we needed to leave for. He said he was looking at things and canceling something. I noticed he refreshed and deleted an email. When I asked why he did that he asked how I saw. He said he was deleting an email pertaining to a gift. He was frustrated the entire time he was doing it, and j couldn't see what would be so stressful. When he finished he said he hadn't gotten anything done. And that he hadn't the time to do it. That it would take him longer and nothing would come by Xmas. When we got back I went into the room for 30mins. I came out and he was watching a show. I asked about what he was doing and he said he was done. 

He was gaurding his phone. He didn't want me on it at all even when I said I wouldn't go into his emails, or any other apps he bought things on. He said a notification could come through at any moment. He turned off all of the notifications but he was still checking his phone often. He never acted so worried about me seeing gifts. If anything he just said to stay off Amazon last year. I did accidently discover that he bought and canceled a Nintendo switch. Something he asked me about a while back and I said I didn't want. When confronted he said I sounded unsure, that I didn't outright say no when I did. When I made it very clear I didn't want it. He also started following me around stores, trying to purchase what I showed interest in, not doing so very secretly either. Something he's done before. The entire situation felt like he put no thoughtfulness into it, like he was scrambling to do it all last minute. 

Now for days he's said, and on his own volition one of the times, that he would get up at 10:30am. He didn't and I asked why he wasn't setting an alarm. That if he truly intended to get up he would be. He said I was right and that he would set one but he didn't. Now onto what happened yesterday. I questioned where all his gifts were and none had arrived. He said he ordered me 15 items. He told me some would arrive after Xmas but I knew some would arrive before. He said that some had already arrived and he had hidden them. And that some of them were canceled. He accidently turned the screen towards me and thought I saw something. He kept questioning if I did, opposed to responding to what I was asking. He acted confused at first as to what I was implying. 

Then we went to get coffee and he asked me what I wanted. I said it and he said ""isn't that like 600 calories?"" I said that was uncessary to say. I have an eating disorder, and he's been making comments regarding the calories in things I eat for some time now. Even after I've told him it upsets me. He said he asked me that because he was considering getting it. When he has been going on about wanting to consume less calories. I knew he likely wasn't going to and he didn't, showing interest in another drink and asking me the calories. 

I told him I wanted extra syrup in and he asked ""Are you sure, aren't they heavy handed here?"" Which he said he asked in case they made it too sweet and I didn't like it. I got upset and said that I felt he was criticizing and judging what I'm eating, the calories I'm consuming. He said when he started doing it that he was trying to help. That he was trying to stop me from eating something that made me feel guilty, as to prevent me from purging. It doesn't come across that way. There was an instance where I ate a tub of Ben and Jerry's. I was smaller at the time and didn't intend to purge it. He remarked wasn't it like 1000 calories which triggered me, and led to me purging. 

Well, he doesn't take well to me expressing my emotions. He kept saying he was asking for himself and he didn't mean it that way. Then he called me a c*nt and an a*shole amongst other things. He said it was an accumulation of everything, and that he was already stressed out because I was questioning him beforehand. He apolgized to me after which he rarely does. The entire day he was glued to his phone and said he was looking at more gifts. He had my mother and I sitting in parking lots for upwards of 30mins at a time as he did. He hasn't been talking to me much or listening. It's not something new but it's upsetting because he is quick to respond and engage with others. Whereas he gets distracted when I'm talking to him, often times looking down at his phone. Never giving me his undivided attention. And acting impatient when he has to. 

My mother talks to him a lot and I can't get a word in. When I try, even just to ask a question, he snaps and says he's overstimulated or he can't hear me. That he can't talk to us both. Or that she will get upset if he doesn't talk to her or respond. His claims he is overstimulated make no sense to me. He will say that and then a second later be back to joking around with her, intitating it himself. We visited relatives of mine yesterday and I didn't talk much at all. When I went to talk to him to ask a few questions, he snapped that there was too much going on. That he couldn't hear me. It was a combination of all of this, of not feeling like a priority, and of thinking he has cheated that made me tell him I don't want any gifts from him. 

Somebody said to me that someone who treats me this way, someone who doesn't seem to care, wouldn't be spending so much time buying gifts and making Xmas special. That makes a lot of sense. And so if he actually has bought gifts I have no clue why. Is it to look good to others? Is it because he feels guilty? Is it to hold over my head or make me feel indebted to him? I've asked him to cancel them and he won't. I've told him I don't feel loved by him and he doesn't seem to care. He's just blanking me on most of it. One day he's apolgizing and agreeing to uphold an agreement, seemingly wanting to get along. The next day he's indifferent and refuses to address any of it.

I delayed it for so long until I reached the point where I had health problems because of smoking. Don’t let yourself ruin your health and life over cigarettes.

I know how you feel, it seems terrifying, like something you can't do. I thought the same. I smoked 60 cigarettes a day, I was so addicted that I would wake up in the middle of the night just to smoke a cigarette and then go back to bed. I had several failed attempts before I finally succeeded in quitting.

Rarely does anyone quit on their first try, but don’t let that discourage you. With every failed attempt, it will get easier. Just like you didn’t learn how to ride a bike on your first try, you won’t master this immediately either. You’ll learn something new each time, why you feel a certain way, when you feel cravings, and how to handle them. In the end, quitting will become easier.

What I can tell you after four years of not smoking is that life is much better, cheaper, and more relaxed. I handle stress better, I’m not constantly nervous, coffee tastes better, and I sleep more soundly. I didn’t lose anything by quitting smoking, I gained so much. My health has improved, and I feel better in every way.

But only you can make that change. No one can force you; nothing will change unless you decide to change it yourself.

1hk7avt,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1hk7avt/two_times_lorelai_deserved_better_apologies/,Two times Lorelai deserved better apologies. ,"So there are 2 specific instances that really bother me when Lorelai gets upset and the person in the wrong guilts her about it. 

When Richard comes to SH for the day and insults her the whole day. He says she drinks too much coffee, he insults her clothing choice and work ethic in front of Michel. He acts like Rory's Father when Dean wants to give Rory the car etc. All of this is totally out of line and rude. I don't hate Richard and Emily like a lot of you do. BUT in this situation I think he was totally wrong. When Lorelai finally has enough and calls him out on it, Richard just makes it all about him. Even if everything he said was correct, just because one thing is true doesn't mean another isn't. Meaning, why can he not apologize for his behaviour and then say ""I'm hurt too"" instead of devaluing her feelings. 

The second time this happens is when Rory misses Lorelai's graduation. 
Lorelai had every right to be mad and hurt. But Rory, instead of taking responsibility, cries and makes it like she's a victim. She has her pathetic rant about not knowing who she is making Lorelai feel sorry for her. I wish Lorelai had gone out with Sookie and Jackson, who showed up for her, and made Rory wait. She deserved so much better on that night. But Rory makes it all about her and how bad she feels. It's so frustrating. (Don't tell me she's a teenager, I was 16 once too and was able to know when it was someone else's special moment.)

I'm sure there are other examples. And I don't need to hear ""but Lorelai's bad too"" or times when Lorelai was selfish. 
I just wanted to know your thoughts on how sometimes Lorelai's emotions seem to be pushed aside and how others saw these two encounters. ",18,1734900352.0,GilmoreGirls,18,0.88,False

1hk79e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hk79e2/dont_get_off_the_ride/,Don’t get off the ride,"***2024’s almost over***, and like every year, it’s time to reflect. This year’s been the toughest of my life. I’ve had responsibilities I couldn’t say no to, which meant sacrificing nights out with friends, travel, and the time I wanted to dedicate to my project and other stuff. But despite all that, I gave it my all. I worked hard, stayed committed. And yeah, I’m still far from my goals, and I missed most of the ones I set (but honestly, who actually hits all their goals?). Still, I’m proud of myself. I’ve built a new version of me, one that knows what really matters in life but also understands when it’s time to buckle up and work hard for those dreams.

Like you, sitting there reading this, I’m also trying to turn an idea, a vision into reality. I spend hours writing code (my GitHub can back me up on that) and drinking more coffee than water (just kidding, haha), but like any *entrepreneur/startup founder/crazy person/slacker* (call me whatever you want) worth their salt, my life’s a rollercoaster going 200 km/h. Some days, I feel like I’m one step away from success: tons of users, real revenue, thinking I’ve built something that will genuinely improve people’s lives. Then, the next day, I hate everything. My ideas feel like dumb jokes, I hate them, and I wonder why anyone would ever pay me a single dollar to use them.

When I first got into this world, I imagined there’d be a day when I could hop off these rollercoasters, kick back in a comfy chair, and watch my ideas grow peacefully. But I realized that’s not how it works, and it’ll never be like that. And you know what? That’s actually awesome. The highs, the lows, the sudden drops, they’re probably the most thrilling part of the whole ride. Working with a bit of uncertainty often pushes you to give even more, to break through your limits.

A few months ago, while working on a project, I hit a crisis I’m sure 99.99% of developers face… “What if no one ever discovers my project? What the hell do I do then? Crap, I’m screwed!” Frustrated, I started looking for answers. I realized that, for someone like me who’s camera shy but loves to write, Reddit was the place to get noticed. So, I started posting, a little randomly, a little about myself. But the more I posted, the more it felt like everything I wrote just disappeared, like those flyers they hand out to promote a new perfume, only to be thrown in the trash.

Last weekend, I had an epiphany: I need to create something to figure out the best time and day to post on Reddit, so finally, someone would actually see what I’m writing. Something that lets me schedule posts in advance, so I don’t have to spend my days (or more likely, nights) writing, and can focus on other stuff (like sleep).

So, on a random Friday night, I bought the domain postonreddit .com between Saturday and Sunday, fueled by excitement and a good dose of caffeine, I threw together an MVP and a landing page. I tweeted all excited, “Hell yeah, go check out what I did!” And then… nothing. Few views, some comments saying my post was written with ChatGPT or whatever, and, worst of all, zero new users on the platform. That’s when the rollercoaster was really heading downhill. You start asking yourself a lot of questions. You wonder if your project even makes sense, if you did enough research, if this or that. But then, screw it, who cares… so, almost by accident, I posted on Reddit (partly to vent some frustration, partly to motivate myself and remind me why I started), and… holy crap, it worked. Over 100K views, messages from people I didn’t even know asking for advice on their projects and how to market them, tons of encouraging comments.

Now, I’m not here to say “I’ve figured it out, my platform works, my post went viral, and everything’s great.” Yeah, I’m on cloud nine, things are picking up, but I know this is just the 0.1% of the entire long journey ahead. Like I said before, this “job” is a rollercoaster, and this post’s a reminder for me (and anyone who relates to this story) to stay strapped in and keep chasing your dreams. So, as the title says ***Don’t get off the ride****.*",2,1734900232.0,startups,0,0.75,False

I'm not sure if you can tell but there are basically no bubbles and the milk tastes¿ silky throughout the drink.

Meanwhile my coffee has a layer of foam on top and then thin¿ milk underneath (second attached photo).

It does look similar to many posts here but I also noticed many others with the silky look. How does one get milk to look like this?

1hk75sf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/1hk75sf/dont_get_off_the_ride/,Don’t get off the ride,"***2024’s almost over***, and like every year, it’s time to reflect. This year’s been the toughest of my life. I’ve had responsibilities I couldn’t say no to, which meant sacrificing nights out with friends, travel, and the time I wanted to dedicate to my project and other stuff. But despite all that, I gave it my all. I worked hard, stayed committed. And yeah, I’m still far from my goals, and I missed most of the ones I set (but honestly, who actually hits all their goals?). Still, I’m proud of myself. I’ve built a new version of me, one that knows what really matters in life but also understands when it’s time to buckle up and work hard for those dreams.

Like you, sitting there reading this, I’m also trying to turn an idea, a vision into reality. I spend hours writing code (my GitHub can back me up on that) and drinking more coffee than water (just kidding, haha), but like any *entrepreneur/startup founder/crazy person/slacker* (call me whatever you want) worth their salt, my life’s a rollercoaster going 200 km/h. Some days, I feel like I’m one step away from success: tons of users, real revenue, thinking I’ve built something that will genuinely improve people’s lives. Then, the next day, I hate everything. My ideas feel like dumb jokes, I hate them, and I wonder why anyone would ever pay me a single dollar to use them.

When I first got into this world, I imagined there’d be a day when I could hop off these rollercoasters, kick back in a comfy chair, and watch my ideas grow peacefully. But I realized that’s not how it works, and it’ll never be like that. And you know what? That’s actually awesome. The highs, the lows, the sudden drops, they’re probably the most thrilling part of the whole ride. Working with a bit of uncertainty often pushes you to give even more, to break through your limits.

A few months ago, while working on a project, I hit a crisis I’m sure 99.99% of developers face… “What if no one ever discovers my project? What the hell do I do then? Crap, I’m screwed!” Frustrated, I started looking for answers. I realized that, for someone like me who’s camera shy but loves to write, Reddit was the place to get noticed. So, I started posting, a little randomly, a little about myself. But the more I posted, the more it felt like everything I wrote just disappeared, like those flyers they hand out to promote a new perfume, only to be thrown in the trash.

Last weekend, I had an epiphany: I need to create something to figure out the best time and day to post on Reddit, so finally, someone would actually see what I’m writing. Something that lets me schedule posts in advance, so I don’t have to spend my days (or more likely, nights) writing, and can focus on other stuff (like sleep).

So, on a random Friday night, I bought the domain [postonreddit.com](http://www.postonreddit.com/)  between Saturday and Sunday, fueled by excitement and a good dose of caffeine, I threw together an MVP and a landing page. I tweeted all excited, “Hell yeah, go check out what I did!” And then… nothing. Few views, some comments saying my post was written with ChatGPT or whatever, and, worst of all, zero new users on the platform. That’s when the rollercoaster was really heading downhill. You start asking yourself a lot of questions. You wonder if your project even makes sense, if you did enough research, if this or that. But then, screw it, who cares… so, almost by accident, I posted on Reddit (partly to vent some frustration, partly to motivate myself and remind me why I started), and… holy crap, it worked. Over 100K views, messages from people I didn’t even know asking for advice on their projects and how to market them, tons of encouraging comments.

Now, I’m not here to say “I’ve figured it out, my platform works, my post went viral, and everything’s great.” Yeah, I’m on cloud nine, things are picking up, but I know this is just the 0.1% of the entire long journey ahead. Like I said before, this “job” is a rollercoaster, and this post’s a reminder for me (and anyone who relates to this story) to stay strapped in and keep chasing your dreams. So, as the title says ***Don’t get off the ride****.*",3,1734899931.0,Startup_Ideas,0,1.0,False

1hk6xa1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hk6xa1/i_work_at_a_national_park_that_doesnt_exist_3/,I work at a National Park that doesn't exist [3],"Hello again, I’m Ranger Jackson and I work at Forest National Park, a Canadian National Park that no one remembers visiting with trees that get taller the further in you go. On my last post ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hew11c/i\_work\_at\_a\_national\_park\_that\_doesnt\_exist\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hew11c/i_work_at_a_national_park_that_doesnt_exist_2/) ), someone commented asking if I could tell the story of someone who got fired. In my decade or so working here, no one’s been fired. That’s because it’s about the worst thing that can happen to an employee since the rules of the Forest still apply to us too. Once you leave, all your memories of working here, often years and years, are gone. While no coworkers have been fired, there's only one employee who has ever disappeared. It’s a name that I’ve mentioned in previous stories, Ranger Daniels. 

Ranger Daniels was the person doing tours when I got here. He looked to be in his late forties and he had been working there as long as he could remember, not that that meant anything since after that long of working here he had no memories of the outside world. Every other job position was filled, so he took me under his wing and taught me everything I needed to know about doing tours and staying alive in the Forest. Once I learned how to do tours, I would take guests down the East Stream and he would take guests down the North Stream. 

He was a great guy, but he loved the Forest. He loved it so much that he would spend every moment of free time exploring it and occasionally he would disappear for days on end doing what he called “camping trips”. He invited me to join him many, many times but I have a healthy fear of the Forest, like any rational person *should* have, so I’d always respectfully decline. Because of how much time he’d spend down there, he was the prime source of information on anything Forest-related. Even Smith would get all of his samples and research from Daniels. Of course, whenever he found something new, he would come to me and open his “almanac” (it was a glorified diary) to show me some sketch of the most awful creature I’ve ever seen, all while beaming like a kid who just got told they can stay up late.

About 6 years back now he started getting weird. He would constantly be jittery and hyper, like he had drank an entire pot of coffee, and spent more and more time in the Forest. Whenever I would see him, he would be muttering to himself about some nonsense and writing in his “almanac”. He was distancing himself from everyone, not even guiding tours anymore. I hadn’t talked to him in months until one day on my lunch break while sitting on a bench in the visitors center he came running up to me.

“Jackson! I figured it out!”

I nearly choked on my sandwich from the shock of him talking to me out of the blue. “Daniels! Figured what out?”

“The Forest, the memory stuff, all of it. The Forest doesn’t just feed on the biomass that enters it, it’s like a… like a hunter, it uses everything, even the bones, but it goes further than the bones, it feeds on the *mind*.”

If I wasn’t before, now I was sure Daniels had lost it. “What the hell are you talking about?”

“Have you ever noticed how, despite everyone who has disappeared over the years, people who work here never do? Why do you think that when people leave, all their memories of this place vanish? It’s using us as a… bank. It’s overwriting our memories from the outside to make way for what it wants- the emotionally charged memories caused by interacting with it. But it’s not… Come with me, I want you to see something.”

He grabbed my arm before I had gotten done eating and dragged me out into the cold winter air. We walked over to the North Stream entrance and made our way into the Forest. One interesting quirk of the Forest is that it’s a lot like a cave in the sense that it stays a constant, if humid, 60 degrees inside year-round, so even though it was well below freezing on the surface, I had to take my coat off and wrap it around my waist in short order. After a couple of hours of walking, even with my jacket off, I started sweating. Looking around, I noticed the trees were larger than I was used to. “Daniels, where are we?”

Absent-mindedly, he replied, “Broadly, Forest National Park, but I would say somewhere in the Midnight zone.”

My stomach dropped. We were deeper than I had ever gone in the Forest. I tried to stay calm, but I felt a panic rise in my chest as I thought of everything Ranger Daniels had shown me in his almanac. “Where are we going?”

“Just a little bit further.” He stopped just ahead of a large spire-shaped rock that jutted out of the streambank and turned, disappearing into the tree line. For a moment I thought of abandoning him, but I knew, despite his obvious insanity, I was far safer with him than on my own, so I followed. Eventually, he came to an abrupt stop. 

“Look, there it is.”

I followed his flashlight, but there was nothing there, just a small clearing between trees covered in pine needles. “What am I looking at?”

“Don’t you see Jackson? The Forest doesn’t overwrite memories, it stores them. And if it stores them, there must be a place where they are stored. If there’s a place where they are stored, then we can get them back. I don’t remember my family, if I even have a family, but I *could*.” He was twitching as he looked in hysteria at something I couldn’t see.

“Daniels, I don’t see anything. Are you… are you alright man?”

“Don’t you want to remember?”

“No. What’s the point of trying to bring something back that’s gone.”

Daniels grabbed me by my shoulders. For the first time, I got a clear look at his face. It was wrinkly and mottled with blue veins. “They were STOLEN from me!” He shoved me to the ground. “I thought you would understand, Jackson. Good luck getting back to the surface, I’m not coming with you.” With that, he walked into the clearing and sat down with his legs crossed, slowly swaying back and forth.

Part of me wanted to drag him out with me, but something compelled me to just leave him, so I did. I left him there, sitting in the Forest, and I never saw him again. 

\--

I write these posts over the span of multiple days because I don’t have time with work to spend hours and hours in the van writing. Also, I don’t want to make Julie suspicious and lose my ability to communicate with the outside world. That being said, I do not remember writing anything written above, but I think I’ve figured out why.

It all started around noon today. I hadn’t had a tour yet because of the weather and I was working on shoveling the parking lot when Julie approached me with a man I’d never seen before. He was in his early 20s and wearing a blue hoodie and jeans. 

Julie gave me her classic fake smile and said, “Ranger Jackson, we have a new hire. He’s going to be doing your job and I want you to teach him the ropes today. This is Danny Woodsworth.”

I gave him a handshake and introduced myself. The rest of the day was showing him around the park. Towards the end of the day, I took him into the Forest and he was fascinated. He clearly had a passion for nature and seemed like he’d be a really good fit. After the tour, I took him to the cabin where he’d be living full-time. 

When I saw it, covered in creeping vines and completely untouched for years, something nagged at the back of my mind. I ignored it and showed him inside. Besides the fact everything was covered in a thick layer of dust, it looked like someone was already living in it. The bed was unmade, clothes littered the floor, and papers covered the desk. On top of the papers was a leather-bound book, which I picked up. Just as I was about to open it, Danny interrupted. “Who lived here?”

Again, there was a nagging at the back of my mind, but nothing came of it. “I don’t know, must’ve been before my time,” I replied.

After Danny was settled, I left and headed to the van. I thought that I hadn’t written anything yet and figured that I probably should, given how long it’s been since the last post, but when I opened that computer, there was the post above, a fully written story that I have no memory of experiencing or writing with a name I have no recollection of. I went back and looked at my other posts, there was the name again, Ranger Daniels. Then, I remembered the book that I had taken from Danny’s cabin. I opened it and there on the first page was a drawing of an older-looking Danny with writing below it that read “Ranger Daniel’s almanac.”

I don’t know why I don’t have any memories of Ranger Daniels, but I think Danny *is* Ranger Daniels. I don’t know what to do, everything just got way, way weirder than anything I’ve experienced in this place so far. What else do I not remember? 

I don’t think I have much longer posting stories. Julie went to the border of the park a couple of days ago to order necessities from the government guys and when she came back she was acting strange. Watching me a lot more and even following me around sometimes. I think they found this account and the stories I’m posting here. More than likely, this van, and any way for me to contact the outside world, will be gone by the end of the week. I don’t remember ever applying for this job and I don’t want to quit, but I don’t want to be here anymore.

I’m going to find whatever Ranger Daniels saw in the Forest. It’s probably going to get me killed, but I’d rather choose that over quitting or living with all that I’ve learned. Maybe Grace was right, maybe joining the Forest is a more gracious fate. If I don’t post again, don’t assume I’m dead, it’d be a disservice to me in the case that I do make it out of this.

1hk6vij,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hk6vij/aita_for_letting_my_sister_and_my_niece_move_in/,AITA for letting my sister and my niece move in with 24 hr notice? ,"My sister (20f) and her daughter (3), my niece, moved in with me on a Friday after asking me the day before. 


My sister called me on a Thursday asking if I could make room for her and my niece as soon as possible. I (23f) shared a two-bedroom apartment with my girlfriend (22f), which was only about 900 sqft. The spare bedroom was our gaming/work-from-home setup, and I struggled to say yes, considering I had no idea what to do with the stuff in our “office” to baby-proof it for the time being.  

She was my sister and my girlfriend gave me a nod that it was okay for them to stay because, after all, my sister asked to stay for the weekend. 

The weekend comes to an end, and my mother shows up with bins and bags of my sister’s belongings. All of her clothes, toiletries, whatever else people own. No one informed me that our mom was not only coming over but with all of my sister’s shit? 

Let me backtrack and explain why she was staying with me and not our mother.
Note: I did not know all of this information prior.
1. She was cheating on her BD and he didn’t know where I lived
2. Our younger brother had anger issues and hated my niece
3. She did not have a job and depended on our mother to provide for her and her daughter
4. She has a severe victim complex

Moving forward, I had a conversation with my sister, asking how long she intended on staying and she replied, “Well I am planning on just moving in.” 

Mind you, my partner and I do not have kids, and being around one full-time was a lot to throw onto someone last minute. I told her she could stay for a month, and I would help her find a job and look for affordable housing. I did exactly that for 3 weeks straight while she slept the entire time. This was around October. 

She took this opportunity to rot on my couch, eat all of our food of which my partner and I bought the groceries. About $280 a week just for the two of them that my sister picked out for her and my niece. 

I started to notice my sister never left the couch, never picked up after herself or her daughter, and never showered. She did not feed, change, bathe, or play with her child once while she was with me. I know because I was home most of the time. I did all of the caretaking for my niece because I could not sit back and watch it. I asked her to please shower so she could have some “me time,” but the real reason was that my couch was starting to smell. 

She never seemed interested when I would find or suggest jobs for her. I found things on Upwork she could do from her phone. I used Upwork during COVID, so I knew it was reliable (sometimes). But anything over nothing would have been great. I felt like she was using my partner and me to be a full-time nanny but in our own house. We never slept because she didn't have a bedtime for my niece. My partner and I spent nights crying and fighting because neither of us could sleep anymore. My sister had no idea what was going on because she was sleeping the whole time, all day and all night. I asked her again how long she planned on staying, and she replied that at least until February.

I finally called my mom and pleaded with her to talk with my sister because I obviously was not getting through to her. I needed her to stay awake during the day to watch her child so I could leave the house and not worry about a toddler running around by herself. My mom called her, and that made my sister pissed at me and told me I was providing “hostile energy.” 

That blew over, and nothing changed. My niece would run around at 3-4 am and run herself into the door or wall, screaming. One night, my downstairs neighbor came knocking on my door, asking what the hell was going on at night. I decided that this was so far out of hand, and I worked for weeks to get my niece to a normal sleep routine. This was about week 1 or 2 of them being at my place. I watched YouTube videos on toddler night routines, googled how many hours of sleep they need, appropriate nap times, natural sleep remedies, etc., 

Remind you, I do not have a child and do not know these kinds of things off the top of my head. One thing I did notice was that my niece was three and could not talk other than singing songs from the YouTube videos my sister played for her 24/7. I worked with her and taught her words, how to count, and how to clean up her toys. My sister said she was nonverbal and autistic but has never been officially diagnosed, and with my psychology education, she did not fit the criteria based on what I know. She was definitely verbal, singing and babbling all the time. When I read to her she would try to repeat after me. Anyway, this topic alone was enough for me to start to resent my sister. 

Backstory: I did not grow up with my mom or sister, I was reunited with them when I was 18. I was neglected by my mother up until I was five, so I saw myself in my niece. I was adopted later on. 

To wrap this story up, two months later, my niece had been trying to sleep on the floor watching TV. It was around 9 am, and nobody had slept that night (except my sister). I was crying in my room because of how exhausted I was, and I woke my sister up to take her child to lie down on their bed because my niece was obviously tired. I FINALLY got to lie down and heard a loud crash. My niece was lying under the glass coffee table and kicked tf out of the glass, shattering it on top of her. My partner ran into the living room first, and I was right behind her, we picked up my niece, and she was fine, not even a scratch, thank god. My sister did not move from the couch and was just staring at her child and scolding her instead of checking to see if she was hurt. I was so upset. I calmly asked my sister to go into the bedroom with my niece while my partner and I cleaned up all of the glass so nobody would get hurt. We also had to put our cats into the other room so they wouldn’t get hurt either.  

After cleaning up the glass, I went to take a shower to calm down. I have not slept in about 38 hours at this point, I was shaky and exhausted. I texted my sister from the other room telling her I would need her to replace the glass since the table was my partner’s grandmother’s table and it meant a lot to my partner. She agreed that once she had the $150 she would send it to me. 

While I was in the shower, my sister began filling a backpack of clothes, and once I got out, I saw her storming out. Our mom had come to pick her up. I tried calling them both but they ignored me. 

I later got ahold of my mom, explaining what really happened leading up to my sister storming out about the table and everything leading up to that. She said that was not what my sister said, and I told her I had the whole thing on the footage, I had an indoor camera that captured the whole incident. Yes, I told my sister about the camera inside, and she had no complaints about it. 

This happened in October 2022-January 2023, and it is now December 2024. I have not seen either of them since and have not heard from them either. Other than my sister telling me I was a terrible person and that it was my fault. 

This is where I am lost.. what was my fault? What did I do wrong? She outwardly used me, and I was too blind to see it at that moment. What did I do wrong to lose the relationships I longed for the most my WHOLE life, my mother and my sister? Am I the asshole???",1,1734899100.0,AITAH,2,0.67,False

“Give me something weird.”

From IMDb: A much-needed boost, in the form of a new factory, is promised to the residents of the tiny fishing village St. Marie-La-Mauderne, provided they can lure a doctor to take up full-time residency on the island. Inspired, the villagers devise a scheme to make Dr. Christopher Lewis a local.

In our house, something weird is not exactly a *tall* order. Our cinematic passions run in all avenues, all genres - if it’s a motion picture, chances are good, we’ll give it a go. The exception to the rule: sorry super hero movies, you’re not likely to grace our screen (yikes), there’s just nothing there for me… which doesn’t mean there’s *nothing* there for you - if the latest Marvel or DC offering floats your boat, by all means: enjoy what you enjoy.

…But ((shrug)) if it’s a horse of a different color that you’re after, I’m your movie dude. The shelves of the evolving Golden Ticket Cinematic Confectionery Shoppe and Television Historium has you covered. That said, Mrs. Lady Zedd’s response to my query, “What kind of movie do you feel like?” needs to be tempered by other factors (i.e. it’s Sunday morning…) I mean, *The Holy Mountain* (1973) is certainly **weird** but is it, “just rolled outta bed, good with a cup of coffee” weird (I think not). What to do?

“How about something French?” said I.

“Oh, *how about* something French!” MLZ quipped back, excitedly.

“… Canadian.” said I.

((Dead silence))

“… Canadian.” said I.

((Continued dead silence))

“…French Canadian?”

((Continued, continued complete dead silence))

“Of the Canadian but French sort? The French, you know… Ca-nay-dia? No? Not so much?? Not as much as I’d have hoped???”

((You see just how weird the entire situation got))

Turns out, Mrs. Lady Zedd had left the kitchen (which is behind my chair) and I was talking to nobody. It happens to the best of us. At least, that’s what I’ve been led to believe.

Truth is - this story of an out in the boondocks town in need of a doctor and a city-slicker doctor not knowing it’s actually just what he needed is absolutely mundane - not a weirdness in sight (unless you count the French Canadian weird, which we don’t… well, no more weird than anything else Canadian… round bacon, really). So why did it “fit the bill” so well?

Simple comedies, ones driven by oh so normal characters caught in unusual circumstances ((shrug)) they’ve gone the way of the dodo, which to us ((double shrug)) is just weird. How has the humble comedy / a bread-and-butter staple of theatres since before the ancient Greeks were penning them in the 6th century BCE / how on earth have they fallen out of favor?

While I’d love to blame Hollywood, the studios, the (so called) culture war, troubles in the middle east (which also were ongoing before the Greeks started penning tragedies in the 6th century BCE)… but the truth lies not with any of them - the problem is *us*. We simply don’t line up to watch them at the cineplex anymore. Somehow *comedies* are too much of a **risk** (financially speaking) which is a real shame (cinematically speaking) but they say the only constant is change, and *change* things have.

…and I’m not worried.

Ok, maybe I am worried but I’m choosing to keep a lid on that worry. Dreading what might come limits my ability to live in the here-and-now. Besides, nobody knows what’s really coming down the line: not tomorrow, next week, next year, or even the next decade. In Arthur O'Shaughnessy’s 1873 poem “Ode”, we are reminded that:

 [We are the music makers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY8GGLI4Sdg), *and we are the dreamers of dreams,*
*Wandering by lone sea-breakers,
  And sitting by desolate streams;*

*World-losers and world-forsakers,
  On whom the pale moon gleams:*
*Yet we are the movers and shakers
  Of the world for ever, it seems.*

Words to be remember, hell - to be internalized - if it’s good enough for Willy Wonka, it’s good enough for me…

**Movie On**

Side note: if the film or story feels vaguely familiar, don’t worry: it probably is. This 2003 French-Canadian movie was the basis of the 2013 Canadian flick [The Grand Seduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/500moviesorbust/s/vFCmj6GHwv) (English langue remake) written up by MLZ in 2022, where (weirdly enough) we just discovered we split by about 10 points too (ha!) you can’t argue with results. Oh yeah… there were also remakes set to begin in France and Italy. Might be fun to track them all down. ((Wink-wink… or is it ooh-la-la?))",3,1734899041.0,500moviesorbust,0,1.0,False

Short Bible Study with me about Titus 3:8

Introduction
------------

Welcome to today’s Bible study, where we’ll dive into a profound truth from the book of Titus. As you journey alongside us, you’ll discover the power of practicing good works and living a life that reflects the faith we profess. This study is not just about understanding a verse; it’s about equipping you with the motivation and tools to shine brightly in your everyday life.

Have you ever wondered why the Bible places such emphasis on good deeds? Is it mere moral obligation or something more profound? Our Heavenly Father designed us for purpose, and in fulfilling that purpose, we find joy, peace, and fulfillment. So grab your cup of coffee or tea, find a cozy spot, and let’s embark on this transformative journey together!

Bible Verse
-----------

Titus 3:8 (NIV): “This is a trustworthy saying. And I want you to stress these things, so that those who have trusted in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing what is good. These things are excellent and profitable for everyone.”

Meaning
-------

In this passage, Paul is writing to Titus, a young leader in the early Christian church. Paul emphasizes the importance of believers devoting themselves to good works, not as a means to earn salvation, but as a natural outpouring of their faith. Our works reflect our relationship with God and can serve as a testimony to others.

Good deeds are not simply acts of kindness or moral duty but spiritual expressions of God’s love in us. When we express our faith through actions, we become living examples of God’s transformative power, illuminating the world around us with His grace and mercy.

Furthermore, Paul insists that such actions are “excellent and profitable for everyone.” This suggests that our good works not only benefit those we directly help but also have a ripple effect, influencing our communities and ultimately glorifying God.

Paul’s exhortation to Titus is a reminder that the Christian life is one of active faith that manifests in loving service to others. It’s an invitation to live out our faith in practical, impactful ways that bless those around us.

Actions to Take
---------------

- **Practice Generosity**: Volunteer at a local charity or help someone in need, sharing not only resources but also time and love.
- **Share Your Faith**: Engage in conversations about your faith with friends or coworkers, offering your story as encouragement.
- **Be an Encourager**: Write a note or send a message to someone who might need some uplifting words.
- **Live with Integrity**: Commit to honesty and fairness in your daily interactions, reflecting God’s character.
- **Seek Spiritual Growth**: Set aside time for regular Bible study and prayer, nurturing your relationship with God and equipping yourself for good works.

Journal Prompts
---------------

1. Reflect on a time when you or someone else demonstrated kindness and the impact it had on others.
2. What are some areas in your life where you can devote yourself more fully to doing good?
3. How does understanding that good works are a natural response to faith change your perspective on serving others?
4. Write about someone you admire for their acts of service and how you can emulate their actions.
5. Explore how your faith journey has been shaped by serving others and how it has brought you closer to God.

Prayer
------

Heavenly Father, thank You for the gift of faith and the opportunity to serve others. Help me to be diligent in devoting myself to doing good, always reflecting Your love and grace. Equip me with strength and wisdom, that my actions may be a testimony of Your goodness. Guide me to be a beacon of hope and light in the lives of those around me. In Jesus’ name, I pray, Amen.

Social Posts
------------

1. “We’re called to let our faith shine through our good works. Embrace the opportunity to be a blessing today! #FaithInAction #Titus38”
2. “Simple acts of kindness can speak volumes about God’s love. Let’s go forth and serve with joy! #GoodDeeds #ChristianLife”
3. “Living faith is active faith. How are you expressing God’s love today? #ServeOthers #FaithfulLiving”
4. “Devote yourself to good works and witness the ripple effect of God’s love in your community. #BeTheLight #ChristLike”
5. “When we serve others, we serve God. Let us strive to make our actions align with His purpose. #LiveOutLoud #Titus3”

Conclusion
----------

Titus 3:8 invites us into a life of purposeful action, where our faith is not just a private conviction but a public declaration of God’s love and power. By engaging in good works, we bring His kingdom closer to earth and inspire others to seek His truth.

We hope this study has sparked a desire within you to live a life of active faith. Remember, every act of kindness, every moment of service, draws you nearer to God and opens doors for others to experience His love.

Thank you for joining us on this journey today. We invite you to continue exploring the richness of God’s Word with us at BGodInspired.com, where more exciting and enriching studies await you. Together, let’s be instruments of His peace and love in the world!

Have you ever met someone who was sunshine in human form? Someone who was poetry encapsulated in a person? Someone whose voice flowed with a cadence that the heavens would be jealous of? Someone so gentle that even the soft breeze on a summer’s day felt harsh? 

I have. I met someone once who I was destined to miss forever, someone whose nature was sweeter than anything I have yet to taste. They radiated warmth in every way imaginable, from the glow of their skin, the way they spoke to me; to the sparkle in their eyes. Eyes a deep rich mahogany brown, eyes that put the most perfect cup of coffee in the morning to shame. 
I met someone who spoke to me so gently that even a goodbye whispered from their lips felt like a prayer. 

I find myself sitting in the sand, staring off into the horizon thinking of them often. The sand heated from the sun, yet cold in comparison to the warmth of who they are. I watch the waves dance along the shore, the water kissing the sand, destined to leave and return again. I wonder if that has been our destiny as well, to live as if we are the ocean and the land. Always a delicate dance between hellos and goodbyes. 

I met someone who was sunshine in human form, but I am simply the moon, forever changing, waiting for the day we meet again. Waiting for an eclipse, so for another fleeting moment I can feel your warmth. ",1,1734898522.0,lostlove,0,1.0,False

1hk6nbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/1hk6nbn/is_it_normal_that_i_still_have_symptoms/,Is it normal that I still have symptoms?,"First of all: I know I should talk to my doctor but the first time I’m seeing her is in April, so I wanted to gather advice before that. 

I have suspected endo (never had surgery, so never confirmed). I’ve been on the pill for a month and a half, I don’t have my period but I do still get the feeling of a bladder infection, issues with my stool,… things that are linked to my endo. 
Is it normal that I still have those symptoms? 

Maybe this is important: I fell out of my routine a month ago because my job ended. Next month I’ll start a new job. But this means I haven’t been good about taking the pill at the exact same time every day, I try really really hard but I’m just really bad ar it.
In the beginning I took them in the evening, but I forgot them so much that I started bleeding again. So, I started taking them in the morning with my coffee. This really worked for awhile, until I lost my routine and I stopped getting out of bed at the same time (once again: I try, but I just really can’t do it if there is no reason for it? I’m just so tired all the time) 
I thought, maybe stupidly, that as long as I kept taking them around the same time (in the morning, but not the exact same hour) it wouldn’t matter since I don’t use them to not get pregnant. But could this be why I have symptoms? Are the hormones that cause endo still breaking through because I don’t take them at the exact same time? 

I have now decided to take them at 12, I have a reminder set and I’m always already up at that time. So if that is the problem it should go away. But I just really wanted to know what you think and if you’ve had experience with this.

Thanks in advance ",2,1734898439.0,Endo,1,1.0,False

Have you ever met someone who was sunshine in human form? Someone who was poetry encapsulated in a person? Someone whose voice flowed with a cadence that the heavens would be jealous of? Someone so gentle that even the soft breeze on a summer’s day felt harsh? 

I have. I met someone once who I was destined to miss forever, someone whose nature was sweeter than anything I have yet to taste. They radiated warmth in every way imaginable, from the glow of their skin, the way they spoke to me; to the sparkle in their eyes. Eyes a deep rich mahogany brown, eyes that put the most perfect cup of coffee in the morning to shame. 
I met someone who spoke to me so gently that even a goodbye whispered from their lips felt like a prayer. 

I find myself sitting in the sand, staring off into the horizon thinking of them often. The sand heated from the sun, yet cold in comparison to the warmth of who they are. I watch the waves dance along the shore, the water kissing the sand, destined to leave and return again. I wonder if that has been our destiny as well, to live as if we are the ocean and the land. Always a delicate dance between hellos and goodbyes. 

I met someone who was sunshine in human form, but I am simply the moon, forever changing, waiting for the day we meet again. Waiting for an eclipse, so for another fleeting moment I can feel your warmth. ",13,1734898207.0,UnsentLettersRaw,2,0.89,False
