my husband deals with depression but he’s not taking any medication or getting any type of therapy. he self medicates with weed and he’s not exactly doing anything to help with his depression. i understand that when it’s bad you’re unable to do anything but lately, i don’t know what to do or how to think. i feel like i’m going crazy. i feel like he doesn’t love me anymore. sometimes i doubt if it’s the mental illness speaking because he just completely stonewalls me and i don’t even know what i’ve done.

i work while he stays home. we don’t have kids. when i come home from work, sometimes he doesn’t even acknowledge me. no kiss or hi or anything when he’s in one of his moods. he’s just on his phone or playing games. sometimes i come home from work and he’s mad and takes it out on me as if it’s my fault. every time i ask him what’s wrong he says nothing. and when i try to talk to him, give him coffee or make food for him, it’s a good day if he actually thanks me. he deliberately ignores me. i kiss him and hug him but nothing. i can’t remember the last time he’s reciprocated. when i’m at work and texting him, it’s always like
he’s not in a good mood.

it always feels like it’s my fault. it’s come to the point where i’ve stopped coddling him for my sanity and i feel like i’m being punished for not giving him that attention anymore. like if i don’t give him love, he doesn’t give me love. 

i’ve talked to him about therapy before. he’s taken anti-depressants before but he stopped taking them. it just feels like he stopped trying altogether. and it feels like he doesn’t love me enough to want to try. 

we’ve been married for 4 years, been together 6. i knew about his depression before we got married. when he lost his job, i told him it’s okay and that i’ll support him, and at a point it seemed like that that’s what was best for him but i don’t know what happened. it seemed like he just stopped trying. i don’t know. he needs help but he doesn’t want to get help. so i don’t know what to do or if there’s anything i can do. 

i don’t want advice but i just want to know that i’m not being crazy. ",1,1734818529.0,depression_partners,0,1.0,False
1hjk9ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1hjk9ol/my_dad_in_the_afterlife/,My Dad in the afterlife,"Dad and Mom were married in the temple in 1966 or 1967. Mom caught Dad smoking a cigarette and drinking coffee just days before their wedding. They still got married, but mom was never eternally happy. Years later as my Dad's health declined she began seeing another man. They all 3 lived together for some time. Even selling my childhood home and moving to a smaller city nearby. Mom always said that God wouldn't make her be with Dad in heaven. God would sort it out somehow. 

Mom got tired of waiting for Dad to die and eventually divorced him. Soon after she married the guy that had been living with them for several years. A little ceremony in the backyard of the home that they purchased together. I'm not sure who originally purchased the place. Dad was in attendance at the wedding. Right there in the front row. Dad moved in with my brother down the street and passed away a couple years later. 

Fast forward 10 years and Mom has asked how I felt about her temple divorcing Dad. Then getting sealed to the current husband. I told her IDC. It's all make believe anyway. 

If I were a TBM and she was telling me this, what will happen to Dad in heaven? He went on to become quite a righteous dude. Don't men have to be sealed to a woman to attain the highest kingdom, or whatever? Wasn't this impossible for a woman to do in the past? Does Dad get to pick a new wife? Or can he just overrule her decision and keep her? Or does she get cloned and live with both men? 

The whole story is wild as hell. Maybe I should be on Mormon Stories someday. Mom asked her Bishop if she could divorce Dad when they'd only been married a couple years. The bishop told her to work it out with dad. So the next move she did was she cheated on him and slept with another man. Bishop told her to ask dad for forgiveness and go back and work it out. 

As I was taking a shower today I was thinking about that up there in Mormon heaven. If Mom divorces him from the temple I'm thinking he might be in trouble. Thoughts on any of this, I'd love the feedback. ",1,1734818423.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False
1hjk9kh,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1hjk9kh/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

Imagine a Voice AI agent so sharp it can answer consumer questions, qualify leads, and book appointments for your sales team—all before you’ve even had your first coffee.

Then the third week came and suddenly I realized my salary had gone up by a thousand bucks and my voice got so deep all my teams meetings sounded like they were movie trailers.

Then came the fourth week and I'm now the ceo of the company and sp500 is listing my company separately. I divorced my wife and got two younger women in exchange. I also for somehow have 27 hours of time a day instead of the typical 24h. Is this all just the typical effects of creatine? ",1,1734817950.0,Creatine,1,1.0,False

You know the ones—they're zooming around at breakneck speeds like they're training for the X Games, totally ignoring the fact that the AQ was not designed for their chaotic energy.

I swear, one of these kids is going to take me out one day. And when that happens, I’ll be glad I’ve got my **PrepareMedical Kit** ([https://www.preparemedical.com/?ref=student](https://www.preparemedical.com/?ref=student)) on me because SFU is not handing out first aid supplies for free when a broccoli head decides to use me as a speed bump.

# What Happens When a Broccoli Head Hits You:

**Scenario 1**: You’re walking to class, AirPods in, daydreaming about your next Renaissance coffee. Out of nowhere, a scooter comes flying at you. WHAM. You’re on the ground, bleeding, dazed, and thinking, “Is this how it ends? Taken out by Chad Jr. on a Razor scooter?”

**Scenario 2**: You dodge the scooter but trip over your own feet in the process. Now you’ve got a twisted ankle, a bruised ego, and the realization that the AQ is a war-zone with these scooter kids. 

Either way, you’re gonna need some band-aids, painkillers, and a lot of emotional support. This is where the PrepareMedical Kit comes in clutch.

# What’s Inside the Kit:

* **Band-aids**: Because broccoli heads have no chill.
* **Tylenol & Advil**: For the headache caused by both the collision and their unapologetic, “My bad, bro.”
* **Antiseptic Wipes**: AQ floors are disgusting (Not to mention the bathrooms). You’re not about to let scooter germs into your bloodstream.
* **Allergy Meds**: Just in case their scooter is dragging half the AQ's pollen behind it.
* **Tweezers**: For when you get gravel or mystery debris embedded in your skin after hitting the ground.
* **Tons of meds!! (For everything, literally, anything and everything).** 

Basically, it’s everything you need to survive the chaos these over-energetic Zoomers bring to campus.

# Why SFU Insurance Covers This (and Why You Should Care):

Turns out, SFU insurance **pays for the kit in full.** You just order it ([link here](https://www.preparemedical.com/?ref=student)) and there's nothing else to it. You don't pay out of pocket for anything, no reimbursement, it's all fully covered.It’s like the school knows we’re all one scooter collision away from a minor broccoli-induced emergency.

# My Broccoli Head Encounter:

A couple of weeks ago, I was walking through the AQ when a literal child zooms past me yelling, “YOLO!” (Yes, they actually said that). I dodged them but... instant rage.

Luckily, I had my PrepareMedical Kit. Popped a Tylenol, slapped a band-aid on the scrape, and kept it moving. Meanwhile, Chad Jr. was off terrorizing someone else.

# TL;DR:

* Broccoli heads on scooters are a public menace.
* The AQ is their battleground, and we’re the casualties.
* Get the PrepareMedical Kit so you’re ready for their nonsense.
* SFU insurance covers it, so no excuses.

Stay safe out there, folks. The broccoli heads are multiplying, and they have no mercy. 🌱🛴💥",8,1734817911.0,simonfraser,0,1.0,False
1hjk35p,https://www.reddit.com/r/mounjarouk/comments/1hjk35p/first_week_and_a_bit_feeling_good_5_kg_down/,First week and a bit. Feeling good. 5 kg down,"So, I took my 2nd dose yesterday and I can only say WOW. If you read my first post my SW was shocking and when I weighed myself before taking my first dose I was shocked at the figure of 207kg. This drug has been incredible for me though. First of all, my nicotine cravings and oral fixation? Basically gone completely now. In terms of my relationship with food it's incredible. My sister is visiting with my young nephew, as a result I have a lot of snacky things in the house especially with Christmas coming up. Usually biscuits and such would not be safe in my house but I've not touched them. No interest. I have been slightly concerned I am perhaps not eating enough, however I do think what I am eating is good. 

Breakfast: 150g of 0% fat greek yoghurt with 150G of Prunes in juice. It works out at something like 300 calories and keeps me full all day. 

Midday: honestly, a cup of coffee is all I find I want or need at this point. 

Evening meal: I'm a big fan of cooking, and with having my young nephew I love trying him with new foods, so all homecooked meals. Some form of protein, at least 2 different veggies (LOVE cabbage. A whole head of cabbage is like 300 calories?) and maybe a starch but I usually can't manage it. 

So generally speaking I've been hitting around 800-900 calories. Which yes, is probably on the lower end. However I feel great. My energy levels are good. IBS has been settled. No complaints. 

As a result in my first week I lost 5kg. And the most incredible part? It felt easy. Waking up and weighing myself every morning to see a  slightly lower number feels phenomenal. I cannot begin to put into words how incredible this has felt.",3,1734817884.0,mounjarouk,0,1.0,False

It started three weeks ago. I was flipping through the radio stations during my late-night drive home from work. I’d been stuck in the office far longer than usual, and the empty highway was making me restless.

I stopped on a station that wasn’t quite tuned in. Static crackled through the speakers, but underneath it, I could swear I heard a faint voice. I thought it was just interference, so I left it on, waiting for the signal to clear.

But it didn’t.

Instead, the voice grew louder. Not clearer, just… louder. It wasn’t talking, exactly. It was like someone was whispering over static, their words indistinct but urgent. The sound made my skin crawl, so I turned the dial to another station and didn’t think much of it.

Until the next night.

I was driving home again, and the same thing happened. Static. Whispering. This time, I didn’t stop on the station, but even as I flipped through others, the whispers stayed. Faint, almost imperceptible, but there.

I turned off the radio and drove in silence, my heart pounding. When I got home, I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone had been in the car with me.

By the end of the week, the whispers weren’t just on the radio. They were in my TV. In my phone. Hell, I even heard them through the baby monitor when I was at my sister’s house babysitting.

And they were getting clearer.

I started hearing my name.

I didn’t want to tell anyone—I mean, how do you explain that? “Hey, do you ever feel like your electronics are talking to you?” But after a while, it got so bad that I broke down and told my coworker, Jenny.

She laughed it off at first, but then she froze. “Wait,” she said. “Are you serious? Because… I’ve been hearing weird stuff too. Not voices, but like… static. At random times. In places it shouldn’t be.”

We spent the rest of the day trying to convince each other it was just a coincidence. But when I went home that night, I didn’t turn on the radio, or the TV, or anything. I just sat in the dark, trying to ignore the faint crackle coming from the outlets in my walls.

The first real words came last night.

I was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, when the whispers started again. I didn’t bother trying to figure out where they were coming from—it could’ve been the lamp, or the smoke detector, or even my phone, which was powered off but still managed to emit a faint hum.

The words were garbled at first, but then one sentence came through, clear as day:

“Do you remember what you did?”

My blood turned to ice.

“I didn’t do anything,” I whispered back, feeling like an idiot for talking to static. But then it responded:

“You will.”

I didn’t sleep. I spent the whole night pacing my apartment, unplugging everything I could think of. I even turned off the breaker. But the static didn’t stop.

And now it’s everywhere. I hear it in my car, in the coffee shop, at work. The whispers follow me wherever I go, growing louder, more persistent. Jenny told me yesterday that she’s been hearing them too, and now they’re saying her name.

“Maybe it’s some kind of signal,” she said. “Like a broadcast that only certain people can hear.”

But that doesn’t explain the dreams.

Last night, I dreamt of a field. It stretched on forever, the grass blackened and dead, and the sky filled with white noise. In the middle of the field stood a figure—a person, but not quite. Their body flickered, like a poorly tuned channel, and when they turned to face me, I woke up screaming.

I didn’t tell Jenny about the dream. But when I saw her this morning, she looked pale, her hands trembling as she held her coffee. “I think it’s coming for me,” she said.

I asked her what she meant, but she just shook her head. “I had a dream. There was a field…”

That’s when I knew. It wasn’t just me. Whatever this was, it was spreading.

And now, as I’m typing this, the static is louder than it’s ever been. My screen flickers, the words on the page glitching and reforming before my eyes. The whispers are no longer whispers—they’re shouts, screams, laughter. They’re everywhere, all at once, filling my apartment with a deafening roar.

The last thing I hear before everything goes silent is my name.

And then:

R’s family and mine spent a lot of time together, and I still see her brother and sister often due to social outings.

When I was 14, my life fell apart. My parents divorced after years of physical and sexual abuse from my father, my closest childhood friend was institutionalized for self-harm, and COVID forced me into homeschooling during my eighth-grade year. I was stuck in an abusive household with no social circle and fell into the worst depression of my life. During that time, R was my only consistent support. I eventually developed feelings for her and confessed, but she gently turned me down.  

After that, I told her that it was best for me to distance myself so that I could move on, but I ended up reinitiating contact far too soon because I still desperately needed someone (anyone) to talk to. We became close again during my freshman year, bonding over our shared struggles, including coming out as bisexual to each other and living in broken homes. But although I didn't see anything wrong at the time, I leaned on her too heavily, using her as an emotional crutch and unloading my trauma onto her. At the time, I justified it as her just being a good friend, even referring to her as my therapist a few different times, but looking back, I realize how selfish and somewhat abusive it was.  

At one point, still dealing with the weight of everything, I lashed out and texted her: ""You're the reason my life sucks."" I told her I couldn’t see her anymore because it was too painful, due to me still being heavily infatuated with her. She took it graciously, noting that she’d be leaving for college soon and that we’d naturally drift apart. A week later, I opened my eyes to how that must have made her feel, and I tore into myself after that for how I treated her, how our entire relationship revolved around her trying to stop me from doing something drastic to myself.

After nearly a year, I reached out to apologize. We met up at a coffee shop and spent nearly six hours unpacking everything that had happened. I took full responsibility for how I had treated her and apologized tearfully. We met once more a few months later, and that was the last time we had a meaningful conversation. It seemed like we both found some closure, and I didn’t want to disrupt her life any further.  

However, a mutual friend later told me that around the time we stopped talking, R was dealing with severe mental and physical health struggles, including major depression and heart troubles. I had no idea, and I now realize how my dependency on her—combined with my implied threats that I’d spiral if she left—must have worsened the already horrific situation she was living through. I understand, apologize, and deeply regret everything I've done.

Now, my life is in a much better place. My mental health has improved significantly, I’ve built a strong social circle with people I love and care for, I’m pursuing college, and I recently ended my first (amazing) relationship on good terms. But despite all this progress, I can’t shake that original guilt and sadness when I think about R.  

We haven’t had a real conversation in nearly two years, and our interactions are now limited to polite greetings on holidays. While we act friendly in person, it feels extremely hollow. I don’t want to disrupt her happiness or bring up the past, but I can't help but remember the way I used her kindness and concern to alleviate my own personal situation.

For context, I've journaled about this, wrote letters to her (before burning them), and reflected on this extensively. It doesn't consume me as much as it did, thank god, but it all still resurfaces occasionally, and when it does, I'm unable to enjoy life for a period of time when I'm near her, thinking about her, or when she's referenced in conversation.",1,1734817323.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I'm 31, 13 years on T (irrelevant for this question really), 5'9, 75kg.

I'm pretty active - I try to hit the gym 2-3 times a week. I usually work four days a week and commute there by bike (about 10 miles round-trip at about 10mph, chill pace). I'm a barista, so I spend \~35 hours a week (including two days at 10.5 hours) on my feet, though not necessarily moving around that much. I also do a bit of inline/ice skating and go rock climbing and hiking in the summer. I also like to do long day rides on the bike and I usually go on a cycle touring/bikepacking trip at least once a year. 

In the past, I've sort of just eaten *whatever* really, with a big focus on carbs - pasta especially, but also a lot of cake and just... low-quality shit. But this last year, when I started lifting at the gym, I became a lot more mindful of what I was eating and I've made a concerted effort to increase my protein intake while decreasing how much processed food I eat - and with good results. But let's be real, I work in a coffee shop and I'm pretty hungry, so I constantly find myself turning to cake as some easy fuel. I feel like I've got my main meals dialled in pretty well, but I'm struggling to think of some more nutritious snacks to keep me going, so I'd love to hear what yous all eat as snacks. I don't mind prepping them ahead of time, but things that are easy to carry and eat on the go would be ideal.

Crying every night, country music, begging, chasing for one hour, one conversation for closure. Met with complete apathy and coldness. Fast forward 2 years, I don't care about him anymore. I know his bullshit, his lies, he's blocked on all platforms. I won't lie and say I wouldn't enjoy a coffee and catch up, but it would be surface level. I wouldn't entertain this clown again in my life.

So...it does go away. The pain subsides, and your self respect comes back. 

That being said, WORK on yourself. Simply avoiding relationships and triggers, isn't work. I since got involved with a situationship who turned cold after it ended, and I've done a similar amount of chasing, albeit over 3 months, as opposed to 2 years. And no country music this time. That being said, my validation and abandoment issues are still there. So, it does get better, but work on healing in the meantime.

1hjjphp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1hjjphp/its_been_almost_5_years_and_i_have_finally/,It’s been almost 5 years and I have finally decided to share my “ Recovery story “ ,"I was in my 4th semester of engineering when I had my first panic attack. Looking back, I was always an anxious kid—constantly fearful and doubtful about almost everything. However, I never experienced anxiety as intense as I did in university. There were a few moments of unease, but nothing to this extent.
I still remember my first panic attack clearly. The unease I had been feeling kept intensifying. I had consumed a lot of coffee that day, which may have contributed. It felt like I wasn’t in control of my mind—though I was aware of my surroundings, I felt like I was losing my grip. Then came the fear of a heart attack. I was shaking, my hands were numb, and my heart was racing. It was so bad that I ended up seeing a doctor, but everything appeared fine. Despite that, my anxiety continued to spiral, and by the next day, I had to leave for my uncle’s place since my university was shutting down due to the COVID-19 lockdown.

The next few months were literally hell used have constant anxiety every single day I couldn’t function stopped eating ( lost 15kg s in a month ) used to cry all day … I remember my blood sugar dropping to 22 ( don’t know the unit ) but to summarize it was bad bad , hell on earth ) still haven’t fully got over it 

Tried a lot of doctors finally found an angel who I think saved me by explaining everything so logically and giving me the confidence to let go and gain back my life 

I had my last real panic attack by which I had to go to ER on my 21st Birthday (24 now ) 

Over the next few months, things got a bit better, but I had developed many irrational fears that I had to fight every day. I was determined not to return to that dark place. Eventually, I went back to university, and over the course of a year, I slowly overcame my fears.
I ended up missing only one semester and was back on track. I started going to the gym, took supplements, slept better, and reduced my medication. Then, I started working, which kept my mind busy, and I met the love of my life who helped me get off meds, boosting my confidence. Even now, I sometimes carry an SOS, just in case.
Don’t get me wrong—I still have bad days. Some days, I avoid going to certain places. Sometimes, I need to step away to calm down, and yes, I still cry. But I’ve learned to manage it. Anxiety has become like a companion—driving me forward. As I told my girlfriend, it’s like Tom and Jerry, where I’m Tom and anxiety is Jerry.

To anyone just starting this journey: trust me, life does get better. You’ll make amazing memories and meet incredible people. And before you know it, this overwhelming feeling will just be a minor inconvenience in your life. Even though it feels all-consuming now, it will eventually pass.

And heck I even won an award in a company gathering , I know it’s all bull …. But for a person who wasn’t able to step out of their home it definitely feels good 

For the people who read the entire thing thank you …. And I wanna thank my parents , uncle & aunt , my gf .. this experience made me realize family is everything

R’s family and mine spent a lot of time together, and I still see her brother and sister often due to social outings.

When I was 14, my life fell apart. My parents divorced after years of physical and sexual abuse from my father, my closest childhood friend was institutionalized for self-harm, and COVID forced me into homeschooling during my eighth-grade year. I was stuck in an abusive household with no social circle and fell into the worst depression of my life. During that time, R was my only consistent support. I eventually developed feelings for her and confessed, but she gently turned me down.  

After that, I told her that it was best for me to distance myself so that I could move on, but I ended up reinitiating contact far too soon because I still desperately needed someone (anyone) to talk to. We became close again during my freshman year, bonding over our shared struggles, including coming out as bisexual to each other and living in broken homes. But although I didn't see anything wrong at the time, I leaned on her too heavily, using her as an emotional crutch and unloading my trauma onto her. At the time, I justified it as her just being a good friend, even referring to her as my therapist a few different times, but looking back, I realize how selfish and somewhat abusive it was.  

At one point, still dealing with the weight of everything, I lashed out and texted her: ""You're the reason my life sucks."" I told her I couldn’t see her anymore because it was too painful, due to me still being heavily infatuated with her. She took it graciously, noting that she’d be leaving for college soon and that we’d naturally drift apart. A week later, I opened my eyes to how that must have made her feel, and I tore into myself after that for how I treated her, how our entire relationship revolved around her trying to stop me from doing something drastic to myself.

After nearly a year, I reached out to apologize. We met up at a coffee shop and spent nearly six hours unpacking everything that had happened. I took full responsibility for how I had treated her and apologized tearfully. We met once more a few months later, and that was the last time we had a meaningful conversation. It seemed like we both found some closure, and I didn’t want to disrupt her life any further.  

However, a mutual friend later told me that around the time we stopped talking, R was dealing with severe mental and physical health struggles, including major depression and heart troubles. I had no idea, and I now realize how my dependency on her—combined with my implied threats that I’d spiral if she left—must have worsened the already horrific situation she was living through. I understand, apologize, and deeply regret everything I've done.

Now, my life is in a much better place. My mental health has improved significantly, I’ve built a strong social circle with people I love and care for, I’m pursuing college, and I recently ended my first (amazing) relationship on good terms. But despite all this progress, I can’t shake that original guilt and sadness when I think about R.  

We haven’t had a real conversation in nearly two years, and our interactions are now limited to polite greetings on holidays. While we act friendly in person, it feels extremely hollow. I don’t want to disrupt her happiness or bring up the past, but I can't help but remember the way I used her kindness and concern to alleviate my own personal situation.

---------------------------------------------

Water is often overlooked, yet it plays a vital role in maintaining your health. Staying hydrated isn't just about quenching your thirst; it impacts many aspects of your well-being. Here are ten compelling reasons why drinking water is essential for a healthier life.

### 1. Supports Digestion

Water aids in breaking down food so your body can absorb nutrients effectively. When you drink enough water, you're less likely to experience digestion issues such as constipation. Remember to drink water before and during meals to facilitate digestion.

### 2. Maintains Body Temperature

Your body relies on water to regulate temperature. When you sweat, you lose water, which cools down your body. Proper hydration helps maintain a stable body temperature, particularly in hot weather or during exercise.

### 3. Enhances Physical Performance

Staying hydrated is crucial for peak physical performance. Even a small amount of dehydration can lead to fatigue and reduced endurance. If you're exercising, make sure to drink water before, during, and after your workout to keep your performance up.

### 4. Improves Skin Health

Drinking water can give your skin a healthy glow. When you're well-hydrated, your skin is more elastic and less prone to dryness. It's important not only to drink water but also to incorporate fruits and vegetables with high water content.

### 5. Boosts Energy Levels

Dehydration can lead to feelings of fatigue and tiredness. By drinking enough water, you can maintain energy levels throughout the day. If you're looking for a simple boost, consider a glass of water before grabbing a snack or coffee.

### 6. Promotes Kidney Function

Your kidneys filter waste from your blood, and water plays a key role in this process. Drinking ample water helps the kidneys eliminate toxins effectively and can reduce the risk of kidney stones and urinary tract infections. Aim to drink enough water daily to support these essential organs.

### 7. Aids Weight Management

Water can act as a natural appetite suppressant. If you drink a glass of water before meals, you might find that you consume fewer calories. This simple habit can assist with weight loss or management. Additionally, replacing sugary beverages with water cuts down on total calorie intake.

### 8. Enhances Brain Function

You might be surprised to learn that hydration also impacts your brain. Studies show that even mild dehydration can impair mood, memory, and focus. Keeping hydrated increases cognitive function, so keep a water bottle nearby while you work or study.

### 9. Keeps Joints Lubricated

Water serves as a lubricant for your joints, ensuring they function smoothly. Adequate hydration can prevent joint pain and stiffness. This is especially important for active individuals and those who engage in sports regularly.

### 10. Improves Immune Function

Staying well-hydrated helps your immune system function optimally. Water helps in the transportation of nutrients and oxygen to cells, which is vital for overall bodily functions, including immunity. Proper hydration can reduce the risk of illnesses, especially during cold and flu season.

Adequate water intake into your daily routine is one of the simplest ways to enhance your overall health. Consider setting reminders on your phone or carrying a reusable water bottle to encourage yourself to drink more throughout the day. Remember, your body is made up of approximately 60% water, so it’s important to keep those levels up!

How Hydration Affects Your Mood and Energy Levels
-------------------------------------------------

Water is often referred to as the essence of life, and for good reason. Staying hydrated plays a significant role in maintaining not just your physical health but also your mental well-being. When it comes to mood and energy levels, drinking enough water can make a world of difference. Here are several key points to understand just how hydration affects your overall quality of life.

### The Connection Between Hydration and Mood

Your brain is made up of approximately 75% water, so it’s no surprise that dehydration can have a profound impact on your mood. Here are some ways hydration influences your emotional state:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Improved Focus**: When you’re adequately hydrated, your brain functions optimally. This means better concentration and clearer thinking. On the flip side, dehydration can lead to feelings of fogginess and confusion, making you feel irritable or anxious.
- **Reduced Fatigue**: Low energy can lead to frustration and a short temper. Drinking enough water helps maintain your stamina, keeping you feeling more upbeat and less prone to mood swings.
- **Less Stress**: Staying hydrated helps regulate cortisol, the stress hormone. Keeping your body hydrated can help you manage stress more effectively and maintain a more positive outlook.

### Energy Levels and Hydration

Just like your mood, your energy levels are heavily influenced by how much water you drink. Here are some effects of hydration on your energy:

- **Enhanced Physical Performance**: Whether you’re exercising or simply going about your day, hydration is key for peak performance. Water aids in muscle function, helping you feel more energetic during workouts or daily activities.
- **Better Sleep Patterns**: Dehydration can disrupt your sleep cycle, leading to tiredness throughout the day. Hydrating adequately can improve your sleep quality, ensuring you wake up refreshed and ready to take on the day.
- **Stable Blood Sugar Levels**: A well-hydrated body is better at regulating blood sugar, helping you avoid those mid-afternoon energy crashes that result from dehydration. Balanced blood sugar keeps energy levels steady.

### Signs You Might Be Dehydrated

It’s crucial to recognize the signs of dehydration, as they can directly affect how you feel. Here are some common symptoms:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Dry mouth and fatigue
- Increased thirst or appetite
- Headaches and dizziness
- Difficulty concentrating

If you experience any of these symptoms, it’s a good indication that you need to increase your water intake.

### How to Stay Hydrated

Staying hydrated doesn’t have to be complicated. Follow these tips to make sure you get enough water throughout the day:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Carry a Water Bottle**: Having a water bottle on hand serves as a constant reminder to drink more water. Choose a bottle that you enjoy using!
- **Set Reminders**: Use phone alarms or apps to remind you to take a sip every hour or so.
- **Easily Accessible Water**: Keep water within reach in your home, car, or workplace. This makes it much easier to drink throughout the day.
- **Add Flavor**: If you find plain water boring, infuse it with fruits like lemon, cucumber, or berries to make it more enjoyable.

### Direct Benefits of Proper Hydration

When you prioritize hydration, you will notice a range of positive changes:

- Improved mood
- Enhanced energy and performance levels
- Reduced feelings of anxiety and stress
- Better overall focus and productivity

Drinking enough water is not just about physical health; it's essential for your mental well-being too. By keeping your body hydrated, you can maintain a positive mood and higher energy levels, improving your overall quality of life. Make hydration a priority, and you’ll reap the benefits both mentally and physically!

The Connection Between Water Intake and Physical Performance
------------------------------------------------------------

Water plays a crucial role in supporting your physical performance. If you want to boost your workout results, staying properly hydrated is essential. Let’s explore how adequate water intake influences various aspects of your physical capabilities.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### 1. Enhances Endurance

One of the primary ways that water affects your performance is through endurance. When you exercise, your body loses water through sweat. This loss can lead to dehydration, which negatively impacts endurance and stamina. Hydrated muscles perform better, allowing you to push through that last mile or finish that final rep with ease.

### 2. Aids in Temperature Regulation

Your body maintains a stable internal temperature during workouts through a process called thermoregulation. Sweat is your body’s natural coolant, and without sufficient water, this cooling mechanism becomes inefficient. Proper hydration helps you stay cool, preventing overheating and allowing you to train consistently.

### 3. Supports Joint Health

Water is vital for lubricating your joints. If you’re engaged in high-impact workouts, like running or lifting weights, keeping your joints well-lubricated is crucial to avoid injury. Staying hydrated helps maintain the synovial fluid that cushions and protects your joints.

### 4. Improves Muscle Recovery

After an intense workout, your muscles need time to recover. Drinking enough water can aid in this recovery process. Proper hydration helps transport nutrients throughout your body, repairs muscle tissue, and reduces soreness post-exercise. This means you can get back to your routine quicker and more effectively.

#### 5. Increases Focus and Motivation

Staying hydrated is not just about your physical body; it also affects your mental state. Dehydration can lead to fatigue and reduced cognitive function. By drinking enough water, you’ll find that your focus improves, and your motivation levels can rise, which is especially beneficial during tough workouts.

#### 6. Aids in Nutrient Absorption

Your body requires water to effectively absorb nutrients from the food you consume. Hydration helps break down food so that your body can utilize vitamins and minerals that are necessary for energy production and overall performance. When you’re well-hydrated, your body can work efficiently, maximizing the benefits of your hard work in the gym.

### 7. Promotes Cardiovascular Health

Proper hydration aids in maintaining a healthy heart and can improve your overall cardiovascular performance. When you're hydrated, your blood volume increases, which enhances blood circulation. This means your heart doesn’t have to work as hard during exercise, allowing you to perform better and recover faster.

### 8. Reduces the Risk of Injury

Dehydration can lead to muscle cramps and spasms, which significantly increase the risk of injury. Keeping your body well-hydrated can help prevent these issues and enable you to perform at your peak. Being mindful of your water intake can mean the difference between a successful workout and an injury-plagued one.

### 9. Enhances Performance in Extreme Conditions

Whether you’re training in hot weather or at high altitudes, proper hydration is crucial. In extreme conditions, your body loses water more rapidly. By ensuring you drink adequately, you can maintain your performance even in challenging environments. This means you can keep pushing your limits no matter the circumstances.

#### 10. Supports Overall Well-Being

Hydration is key to maintaining overall health. When you feel good physically, your performance naturally improves. Drinking water regularly not only benefits your exercise routine, but it also enhances your energy levels throughout the day, making you more inclined to engage in physical activity.

Adequate water intake into your daily routine is fundamental to optimizing your physical performance. Whether you’re a casual gym-goer or a dedicated athlete, remember that staying hydrated is a simple yet powerful way to help you achieve your fitness goals. So grab that water bottle and drink up!

Common Myths About Drinking Water Debunked
------------------------------------------

Drinking water is essential for maintaining good health, yet many myths surround its consumption. Clearing up these misconceptions can empower you to make the best choices for your hydration needs. Let's explore some common myths about drinking water and debunk them one by one.

### Myth 1: You Need to Drink Eight Glasses a Day

While staying hydrated is important, the old rule of drinking eight glasses of water daily may not hold true for everyone. Your hydration needs depend on various factors, including age, sex, activity level, and climate. Instead of fixating on a specific number, listen to your body and drink when you're thirsty. Foods such as fruits and vegetables also contribute to your daily fluid intake.

### Myth 2: All Beverages Hydrate You Equally

Many people believe that all liquids provide the same level of hydration. However, some drinks can actually dehydrate you. For instance, beverages high in caffeine, like coffee and some sodas, can have a diuretic effect, causing increased urination. While they do contribute to your overall fluid intake, plain water remains the gold standard for hydration.

### Myth 3: You Don’t Need Extra Water if You Eat Food with High Water Content

Foods like fruits and vegetables are great for hydration, but they shouldn't replace your water intake. While they contribute to hydration, the amount of water they provide may not be enough to meet your daily needs. It's essential to drink water along with consuming hydrating foods to ensure that you stay adequately hydrated throughout the day.

### Myth 4: Drinking Water Can Flush Out Toxins

There's a popular belief that drinking excessive amounts of water can ""flush"" toxins from your body. While water does help your kidneys filter waste, your body naturally detoxifies itself without needing to drink extreme amounts of water. Instead, aim for a balanced intake to support your kidneys' function effectively without overdoing it.

### Myth 5: Thirst is a Sign of Dehydration

Some think that feeling thirsty means you are already dehydrated. In reality, thirst is your body's way of signaling that you need water, but it doesn’t necessarily mean you have reached a critical level of dehydration. It's always better to drink water regularly throughout the day, rather than waiting until you're thirsty.

### Myth 6: Drinking Too Much Water is Harmless

While hydration is crucial, consuming an excessive amount of water can lead to a condition known as hyponatremia, which is an electrolyte imbalance. This occurs when your kidneys cannot remove the excess water fast enough, resulting in diluted sodium levels in your bloodstream. It's important to strike a balance and not overhydrate, especially during intense physical activities.

### Myth 7: Cold Water is Bad for Your Digestion

Some people believe that drinking cold water during meals can hinder digestion. However, there's no scientific evidence to back this claim. Cold water does not slow down digestion or impact its efficiency. If you enjoy cold beverages, feel free to indulge without worry.

### Myth 8: You Should Only Drink Water When You're Active

Many think that water is only necessary during workouts or when engaging in physical activities. But hydration is vital for everyone, regardless of activity level. Even at rest, your body loses water through breathing, sweat, and urine. Make it a habit to drink water throughout the day.

### Myth 9: Organic or Alkaline Water is Healthier

Organic or alkaline water has gained popularity, with claims that they boost health better than regular water. However, for most people, plain tap or filtered water is sufficient. If you enjoy the taste of these specialty waters, they can be a fun addition but don’t rely on them for superior health benefits.

### Myth 10: You Can Get Sufficient Hydration from Food Alone

Though foods contribute to your hydration, relying on them exclusively will not meet your body's full hydration needs. Water intake is essential for maintaining body functions. Make drinking water a regular part of your day, complementing the hydration you receive from your diet.

Understanding these common myths can help you make informed choices about your water intake. Stay hydrated for a healthier lifestyle, and remember that when in doubt, water is generally your best option for hydration.

Easy Tips for Increasing Your Daily Water Consumption
-----------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is vital for your overall health, and increasing your daily water consumption can be easy. Implementing small changes can make a big difference in your hydration levels. Here are some practical tips to help you drink more water each day.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Set Daily Goals

Start by setting a realistic goal for water intake. A common recommendation is eight 8-ounce glasses a day, but you may need more based on your activity level and climate. Consider using your body weight to estimate your needs: divide your weight in pounds by two to find the number of ounces you should aim for.

### Carry a Water Bottle

Having a water bottle with you at all times is a simple yet effective strategy to increase your consumption. Choose a bottle that you love—maybe one with a fun design or a motivational quote. This way, you’re more likely to keep it close and drink from it regularly throughout the day.

### Use Reminders

Sometimes, you get so wrapped up in your day that you forget to drink water. Setting reminders can be a game-changer. Here are a few methods you can try:

- **Smartphone Alarms:** Set hourly alarms to remind you to take a drink.
- **Apps:** Use hydration apps that track your water intake and send you notifications.
- **Post-It Notes:** Place sticky notes on your desk or fridge with messages like ""Drink Water!""

### Infuse Your Water

If plain water feels boring to you, try infusing it with fruit, herbs, or vegetables. Add slices of lemon, cucumber, or berries to enhance the taste. Fresh mint or basil can add a refreshing twist. This not only makes your water taste better but also provides added vitamins.

### Drink Before Meals

Commit to drinking a glass of water before each meal. This practice serves two purposes. First, it helps you stay hydrated, and second, it may help you control appetite by creating a sense of fullness. It's a win-win situation for both hydration and portion control.

### Track Your Intake

Keeping track of your water consumption can help you stay mindful. You can use a journal, a notes app, or even a simple tally on a piece of paper. When you see the numbers, you may feel motivated to drink more. Seeing your achievements can be a great encouragement!

### Replace Other Beverages

Swap out sugary drinks and coffee for water. Every time you reach for a soda or a latte, think of how much better it is for your health to choose water instead. You’ll not only increase your hydration levels but also reduce your calorie intake. If you really crave something sweet, consider sparkling water with a splash of juice instead.

### Incorporate Water-Rich Foods

Eating foods with high water content also contributes to your daily hydration. Incorporate fruits and vegetables like watermelon, strawberries, cucumber, and lettuce into your meals. You get hydration from your food, making it easier to reach your water goals. Plus, these foods are full of vitamins and minerals!

### Make it a Habit

Consistency is key. Make drinking water a part of your daily routine. Link it with other established habits. For example, drink a glass of water after brushing your teeth or while waiting for your coffee to brew. The more you practice these small changes, the more natural it will feel.

By incorporating these simple tips into your daily life, you can significantly increase your water consumption without feeling overwhelmed. Remember, hydration is essential for a healthier life, and small changes can lead to big results!

### Conclusion

Achieving optimal health involves more than just eating well and exercising; it also requires a commitment to proper hydration. Water plays a vital role in maintaining overall health, helping to regulate body temperature, support digestion, and keep your skin looking vibrant. When you're well-hydrated, you'll likely notice a significant boost in both your mood and energy levels, enhancing your daily activities and making life feel a little more enjoyable.

Moreover, adequate hydration is crucial for peak physical performance. Whether you’re running, lifting weights, or engaging in any physical activity, drinking enough water can make a difference in your endurance and strength. This means that staying hydrated is not just beneficial; it's essential for anyone looking to maximize their fitness routine.

It’s equally important to debunk the common myths surrounding water intake, such as the notion that everyone needs to drink eight glasses a day or that coffee and tea can’t count toward your daily hydration. Understanding the facts allows you to make better choices about your water consumption. By applying easy tips, such as carrying a reusable water bottle or adding slices of fruit for added flavor, you can effortlessly increase your daily intake.

1hjjirl,https://www.reddit.com/r/USMilitarySO/comments/1hjjirl/seeking_support_and_insight_from_fellow_military/,Seeking Support and Insight from Fellow Military Spouses and Partners,"My name is Sarah (using fake names for privacy), and I’m reaching out to share my story in the hopes of finding support, understanding, or advice from others who have navigated the challenges of being with someone in the military.  

Jake and I met in July of last year through my cousin, and things developed pretty quickly between us. Within just a couple of weeks of meeting, he asked me to be his girlfriend. He showered me with gifts—a 75-inch TV, UGG boots, coffee mugs with sweet little sayings—and it all felt so thoughtful and romantic, but also very fast. Still, I fell for him, and we quickly became serious.  

From the beginning, I knew he was deploying, and at the time, I was actually planning to move out of state myself. But we fell in love, and I wanted to be with him.  

Fast forward to January, and he left for Texas for pre-deployment training. In March, he flew me out to visit him, and during that trip, he proposed. When someone asks you the question you’ve dreamed of your whole life, in a beautiful setting like the deserts of Texas at Aztec ruins, it’s incredibly difficult to say no—especially when you love them deeply. So I said yes.  

The first couple of months of his deployment went well. We stayed in close contact, and I sent him care packages every month. Even when I started to feel neglected as the months went on, I continued to send them because I loved him and wanted to show my support.  

By May, I was already struggling. I had a severe anxiety attack and was hospitalized because I thought I was having a heart attack. I remember driving myself to the hospital, terrified. That moment was a turning point for me, and it led me to start therapy and join a women’s Bible study group. I was also healing from past traumas, working hard to grow, and learning how to handle this new military lifestyle that I didn’t fully understand.  

I also tried connecting with the Family Readiness Group (FRG), hoping for support. But I didn’t find them helpful. It felt like their focus was entirely on supporting the soldier and encouraging partners to “stick it out,” even when I was feeling completely neglected. I felt so alone in navigating this relationship, despite trying to surround myself with resources and community.  

By June, things took a turn. Jake gave me an ultimatum: he wanted to stay in the military, and I needed to decide if I was going to stay with him. Reluctantly, I agreed because I loved him and believed in our future. But from that point on, things started to fall apart.  

Toward the end of the deployment, Jake became even more distant. In recent weeks, he started saying things like he didn’t know if he even wanted to be alive, much less if he wanted to be with me. He also shared that he had experienced several traumatic brain injuries, which he believed were affecting him.  

Hearing those things broke me. I wanted to be there for him, but he wouldn’t let me in. Anytime I brought up my concerns about feeling neglected or unsupported, Jake would deflect. He never took accountability for his actions or acknowledged my feelings. Instead, I felt like he was constantly keeping me on edge, almost on purpose. He became extremely cold and distant, and the emotional disconnect between us grew wider and wider.  

Toward the end of the deployment, I was at my breaking point. I started questioning him—asking if he even wanted to stay engaged. Things were so hard, but I really loved him, and I kept trying for us. I know I wasn’t perfect, and sometimes I wonder if I fought too much or pressured him too much. Maybe that’s why he abandoned me the way he did, though everyone I’ve spoken to says it’s not my fault.  

Jake never reassured me, though I desperately wanted him to. He never said, “Yes, I want to see you,” or, “Yes, I want to make this work.” And in the end, he left me completely broken.  

Yesterday was his homecoming. I waited for seven hours, watching all the other soldiers reunite with their families and loved ones. But Jake never came out to see me. Finally, another soldier approached me and said Jake wanted his truck keys. He left me there, 2 1/2 hours away from home, in the middle of a snowstorm. I had to take a $189 Uber back home. He hasn’t answered my calls or texts since. 

It was the most humiliating experience of my life. I feel devastated, shattered, and so unsure of what went wrong. I don’t know if I was too much or if he just couldn’t handle the relationship—or his own struggles.  

I know many of you have been through similar experiences, and I admire the strength of military spouses and partners who navigate these challenges every day. If you have any advice or insight—whether it’s about healing, letting go, or even understanding the unique struggles of military relationships—I would be so grateful.

1hjjgtt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_horrifiedPidgeon/comments/1hjjgtt/falling_in_love_with_someone_you_dont_even_know/,falling in love with someone you don't even know,"i like became obsessed with my ex literally the day i met him,,, that was like idk 5 years ago? i didn't know him at all just knew i really liked him so i kinda ignored all of the things that were negative about him & got with him anyway.... not a great idea.

yea so basically it turned out really bad because he wasn't a very great person and i like kinda went crazy over the fact that he wasn't a good person and we broke up over it.

i've had him on my mind every single day for the past 5 years which is like kinda insane im ngl... i don't even like him anymore so idrk why i'm still thinking about him everyday?

i liget had a dream abt him last night that i went to his house to visit his family and his girlfriend was living with him and he got super mad that i went to his house. also for some reason in said dream his mom was telling me i needed to grab a cup of coffee every single time i walked inside which was kinda funny, like if i went outside for just a few minutes and came back in she'd tell me i need another cup of coffee.

it was really bad when i wasn't over him bcuz i could not stop thinking of him like EVER, he was the only thing i could ever think of and i couldn't sleep off the thoughts because i'd just dream about him! he consumed my life so much to the point that i didn't want to live anymore because i didn't want to think about him anymore. i grew so angry at him because i couldn't stop thinking about him and i took it out on him and treated him really badly. i couldn't handle being near him because i'd just think of all the things he did to me and it made me feel sick, i couldn't handle being away from him because i couldn't stop thinking of him and i just wanted him in my life and going back to being perfect together like we were when we first got together. i really just couldn't handle living in the same world as him and i wished that i could exist in a universe that he isn't in.

i think because i was so infatuated with him from the day we first met that i ignored every single bad thing about him, i thought that he was the world's most perfect person from day 1 when that really just wasn't the case. and people tried to tell me that i shouldn't get with him because it'd end badly, but i didn't listen because why would I listen when I can't see his flaws and I only see him as a perfect person? My brother told me the other day some quote about how when you're seeing everything through rose colored glasses that red flags are just flags to you and really I think that kinda sums up how things were with him.

because looking back he did a lot of really awful things before we were even together, but i just blew it off and I couldn't see it? I was like ohh well he's changed and he's obviously trying to be a better person and he's so sweet and loving to me and he's like the most drop dead gorgeous person i've ever seen in my entire life so how could it even get better than that? But I really only felt that way because I loved from from the day I met him and never got a chance to see him in a regular light, for who he really was.

He told me every day how much he loved me, how great of a person I was, he bought me gifts constantly, made me things, supported me through all of my decisions, and was always there to make sure that I was okay. But he did so much behind my back, he lied to me about almost everything whether it be major events in his life, silly stories, or about more serious things like his problems with drinking and drugs. He'd lie to me about his relationships with other people, he lied to me about what grade he was in after he got held back, he lied to me about EVERYTHING. He treated my friends very badly too, he would constantly manipulate them and say things about them to me that weren't true, and he really just wasn't very good for me either. And while it's not his fault, he was doing so badly mentally that it really dragged me down too. His problems became my problems, his mindsets became my mindsets, and he just exacerbated my already fairly bad mental illness. I was constantly fearing for his wellbeing and he would say very alarming things, send me very alarming things, and disappear for weeks on end leaving me afraid that he had done something to himself. It was to the point where I'd be constantly left wondering whether my boyfriend was alive or dead and I'd have to contact his friends or family trying to get any information about how he was doing. He'd come back and tell me that he had tried to do some horrible things, just confirming my worries.  Just for me to find out from my best friend that what he was saying wasn't even true? And he was talking to her and saying he hasn't been able to get ahold of me, that he felt unsafe and she needed to talk to him or else he would hurt himself. He'd tell her that she can't tell me these things because it'd make me feel bad and he would hurt himself if she caused me to feel bad for not being there for him. But I was ALWAYS there for him and I just couldn't get ahold of him.

He actually caused me to lose all my friends too which was awful. I was so alone. He kept causing issues with my one friend and would constantly threaten him. He lied to me saying that my other friend (my best best friend) was telling him lies about me and I believed it because I didn't think he would ever do me wrong and I trusted him with the world. He told me she didn't treat me as well as I deserved and I deserved better than her and I should cut her off because she'll never be able to treat me right. He slept with my other best friend behind my back and told me that he'd never do that to me and I had nothing to worry about when I had a feeling something was going on between them. At the end I had only him and no one else.

Despite all these bad things about him I still stayed with him because I didn't see the issues. I didn't realize the severity of the things he was doing because when things were good I had never experienced something so great. I loved him with more love than the world had to offer, and he made me feel more loved than I ever thought was possible, more than anyone ever has. I loved loving him and I loved being loved by him. He was so perfect to me that I genuinely felt that he was too good for me, and I didn't know what I had done to deserve someone so perfect. Even since then no one has ever made me feel so cared for. But in reality, he was never perfect, he was never that great of a person, he was just the best at making me feel wanted.

I've never loved someone as strongly as I did him and I pray that I never do ever again. I pray that I never fall in love with someone I don't know ever again. I loved him way too much for my own good and way too much for his own good. I loved him so much from the very beginning that I couldn't see the person he really was.

I later met her boyfriend, and they agreed to the arrangement. This has been going on for the past three months, and I've been very happy.
I've provided them with free accommodation on my ranch, as well as some gifts. They haven't asked me for money, except for the free accommodation and gifts.

I wouldn't say I'm new to mate but I am new to drinking it traditionally. I used to do Guayaki cans or tea bags. The tea bags I would make like tea and add a bit of milk and sweetener (stevia) but sometimes I would also just drink the brew as is. I have recently started drinking it traditionally, mostly because it allows me to consume more caffeine in a way I can tolerate throughout the morning and I can get more of the other health benefits in greater doses. I started with Cruz de Malta but to me it tastes very grassy and kind of sweet like fruit. I think I imagined it to be more like a tea or at least like the brew I would have with the tea bags I was using. I also hate how in terms of temperature it gets bitter at lower temps (roughly 70 degrees C). I want to know in terms of flavor profiles, is mate like coffee, wine or beer where its about personally preference? I prefer white wines, dark beers, and dark roast coffees. Is it possible Cruz de Malta just isn't the right brand for me?

Edit: I called it a tea. I know its not, I apologize.",0,1734814923.0,yerbamate,6,0.5,False

1hjj1qm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hjj1qm,A Probably Too Long Review of Valhalla in Which I Conclude You Should Eat There,"Last night, my wife and I were lucky enough to dine at Valhalla. For anyone not interested in the full review below, here’s the TL;DR: It’s great. Definitely worth a star or two, and you should eat there before the prices go up. Get the “anything but the...” pairing. Go early and order a cocktail or two, either before or after dinner. It’s one of the best meals I’ve had in Chicago.

Here's the full review: 

We arrived about half an hour early because I’d heard the cocktails were outstanding and wanted to partake. Recently, they’ve added a small “lounge” area on one side of the restaurant. It was lovely. Separated by a curtain from the main dining area, the lounge was a dark, candlelit space with large concrete (I think?) coffee tables and comfortable chairs. The vibes were immaculate.

The server was incredibly helpful, patiently answering all our questions, and after we placed our order, the bartender himself—Sammy Faze—came over to explain our drinks. Service throughout the night was top-notch. Everyone who brought us food or drinks was knowledgeable, relaxed, and friendly.

I ordered the Old Fashioned, and it was outstanding. The ice was hand-carved, and the whisky was Japanese. I can’t recall exactly how it was sweetened, but it reminded us of those brown sugar desserts you sometimes find in the frozen section at H-Mart. I highly recommend taking advantage of the lounge before your meal—it was especially magical on a cold, wintry night.

From there, we moved to the counter, where our meal was served.

We love a counter meal. We love being able to see our food being made and the connection it facilitates between diner and kitchen. That said, I can see how the lack of privacy might be a drawback for some, but for us, it’s a bonus.

We opted for the “anything but the...” pairing as well as the “premier wine pairing.” Both were excellent, but if we had to pick just one, we’d recommend the “anything but the...” pairing—it was more fun and unique. The highlight was a Suze and mezcal cocktail topped with a hibiscus and chile foam.

The meal itself blew us away. It began with a trio of “surf,” including a crunchy garlic tuna roll, and a trio of “turf” that really set the tone for the evening. The flavors were big and bold—nothing overly fussy or delicate. Each dish demonstrated a mastery of texture, seasoning, and the balance of spice and umami.

If I had any critique of these dishes—and it’s a very small one—it’s that I didn’t think the noodles added much to the Water Aged fish course. They didn’t detract from the dish, but they also didn’t elevate it in the same way that every other element on the menu seemed to.

We kept waiting for something to disappoint us after such a strong start, but that moment never came. Nothing was bland, boring, or predictable. We were consistently impressed by the level of seasoning and the broths and sauces accompanying the dishes.

The most delicious bite for me was the braised beef breast, prepared in the style of leng saeb. But the dish I’ll keep thinking about was the lobster tsukune. My wife, who usually isn’t a fan of lobster, devoured it—and the savory, buttery sauce it was served with was spectacular. It’s the kind of dish that makes me excited about this style of cooking. That said, I only wish it had been served with something to soak up all that amazing sauce. Maybe a biscuit from the esteemed cheddar bay region? I kid. Kind of.

The savory courses were bridged by a “French onion latte,” an allium broth served with frothed cheddar. It was piping hot and absolutely delicious—kind of like if Better Cheddars became a soup? That said, I couldn’t help but wonder if it really fit the meal. It felt like something that might be more at home on the menu at Schwa. Just a thought—but we still enjoyed it thoroughly.

As widely reported, the desserts were insanely good. The highlight was the black truffle and white chocolate French toast, which completely melted our brains. The crispy French toast paired with a savory-sweet white chocolate and truffle sauce was unlike anything we’ve ever had before—it’s a dish I’ll be thinking about for years to come. Truly special.

The meal ended with an assortment of chocolates that were fun and delicious, though not particularly mind-blowing. That said, we loved when one of the kitchen staff came by, asked us which was our favorite, and brought us one more—maybe a little nod to the “infinite dessert” of the past? Ha!

Before we left, I had to order one more drink. Partly because I love drinking, and partly because I couldn’t leave without trying the “Frozen Martini.” Made with Greek olive vodka and topped with shaved caviar, it was so crazy good. Seriously—get this drink.

It’s probably clear by now that I highly recommend this restaurant. The service, food, and drinks all hit perfectly. I have no doubt it will be receiving a star next year—maybe even two. It was that good, and I haven’t been this excited about food in a long time.

The total check came to $900. That covered two tasting menus, two pairings, and four extra cocktails. Honestly, in today’s dining environment, I find this reasonable. I’d also like to point out that this meal was huge. The first three courses alone included eight bites of food—many of which would count as an entire course on other tasting menus. We left crazy full, which, in my opinion, doesn’t happen enough these days.

I can confidently say: go to Valhalla. You won’t be disappointed.",28,1734814790.0,chicagofood,3,0.94,False

I used to struggle to sleep or not sleep at all. The lack of sleep has gotten better. But I do sometimes intentionally skip sleep by choice. 

The problem now is my internal clock is broken. I stay up till upwards of 5am and wake up at noon or later most days. I really hate it. I feel ashamed and I feel like the people in my life judge me for how I sleep. I don't even get to sleep with my boyfriend because me sleeping in distracts him while he works in the morning. So I always have to sleep in my room. Which makes me feel more isolated. And admittedly it's making me feel more disconnected from my partner. 

The pieces of this situation: 
- Alarm clocks do not wake me up 
- Challenge alarm clocks can work sometimes but typically my sleepy brain can still find ways to get around them. I can wake up angry if they're more intense and effective. Which is why I stopped using them. (I'm neurodivergent so sometimes I'd find it overwhelming, adhd to be specific.)
- Sometimes I feel like the only way to get time to myself is to be up super late at night. 
- I drink two energy drinks a day and sometimes coffee. I typically drink the first around 2pm and the second around 10pm. (I've been fully resigned to a shitty sleep schedule up until this point.) 
- I take adhd meds (extended release) around 1-3pm every day 
- it's hard for me to get out of bed in general

I spilled coffee on my running laptop and cleaned it thoroughly after opening it up. Before cleaning, I took pictures and later noticed that a small component is missing (highlighted with red arrows in the attached image). The board labels it as **C759 or EL11**—it doesn’t seem like a capacitor or transistor, more likely a diode.

Now, the laptop works on battery but not on charger (charger won’t charge the battery, and it won’t power up without the battery). I’m reading 19V at the charging port and capacitor near the battery connector.

Could the missing component be the cause? Any help identifying or sourcing it would be much appreciated!

I've had TMD slowly develop since jaw surgery and wisdom tooth extractions in 2004,2005.

Up until this 2024 I was able to live mostly normally with TMD.

Back In fall 2023 I had a root canal.

I felt fine until February 2024 when I got Covid. I also started developing tooth pain.

I want back to endodontist and had root canal retreatment as the dentist missed a 4th canal.

Shortly after I started prolozone injections to the Jaw. This was only temporarily helpful. I did 1 treatment every 4 weeks for 3 months.

During this time in the summer of 2024 I started experiencing facial neuropathy/crawling sensations on my face. 

In the fall I tried PRP injections to the jaw that were ultrasound guided. I had times where I felt great and other times I felt no change. Between 6 and 10 weeks post I felt the best.
It's now been 14 or so weeks since then.

I continue to suffer with daily migraines that feel like sinus headaches. I get occasional malaise/fatigue. My upper molars still get phantom pain. Increase in blood pressure makes it all worse. My temples are very tender as well as back of my head. Parts of my skull feel bruised.

I've tried supplements like magnesium, fish oil, NAC, cutting down on coffee to 1 cup a day, Antihistamines daily, no sugar or processed foods (I eat very clean). 

I use red light therapy daily, walk a couple miles a day, and drink a lot of water. I get dry needling every week.

At this point with these daily chronic headaches and neuropathy which is now being felt in my ears I'm considering seeing a neurologist to rule out any CSF Leak or other anomalies. 

I don't take any medications except an occasional Tylenol or muscle relaxer. 

I'm tired of living this way. I am married and have 2 kids who are 7 and 9. I want to feel normal. I pray for healing every day. 

I've always been against botox but now I'm wondering if it is what I need. 

I've always vowed to not do another surgery but I'm considering fat grafts since I've been told I'm a candidate by the now retired Dr. Piper. I don't wanna pay 100k for suegery though, and I don't know how much of my symptoms will truly be fixed.

While we were watching the teachers to see if they needed any assistance, I first said something to them.

⚪️ They mentioned it was hot and I was like yeah. (I was literally sweating but my antiperspirant SAVED me!!)

⚪️ They joked about me looking serious, saying that every time they looked over at me, I had an expression that was like I was going to get a mugshot, which made me laugh. It felt like they were paying attention to me, and when they gave me eye contact, I couldn’t stop smiling!

⚪️ After that, there wasn't much, but they mentioned the chorus (other students) behind us were good at singing. (why did I almost laugh, I shouldn’t laugh though because they’re into music and might know those people..)

There might be more because I can't fully recall. 

Now we're near break though, and I won't see them until next year.

I really want to befriend them, but know it'll be near impossible once school starts. We don't sit near each other and rarely have a chance for interaction. They also have friends that they always speak to.

Since the year is ending, I just wanted to say I'm really grateful to have found this sub and the journey I went through.
I have always heard about Manifestation but never really believed it. I stumbled upon this sub while I was nursing a heartbreak and giving up on a relationship with someone who is my soulmate. I don't believe in signs but I feel I was always meant to find out and question my views of Laws and Manifesting the day I decided to give up on my love story.

It's funny, I got into these rabbit holes to manifest a sp but returned with myself while and new.

My goal was to Manifest my Sp loving me... Currently, it is to find love the one I deserve from the man who I know my Sp is. 
Read the previous line again. 
I believe and Know my Sp shows up as the Man of my dreams, my true soulmate and partner even though in 3d our story has suddenly paused and we are in no contact. I'm aware that my past beliefs led that but I also know my current beliefs have so much for me in store.

Since starting and learning about the laws and manifestation, I was able to (by just working on my self concept):
1. Heal my own traumatic wounds and Depression I had since 14 (I'm 26 now). I was able to face myself, revise, script and create a new identity for myself through self concept work and challenging my limiting beliefs. For me this is my biggest accomplishment. I feel so 🦚 of myself for this one.
2. Was able to form and reconnect with so many of my old friends I lost contact with or had terrible fights. In a way they took were my sps in friendship and I got three of them back in this year alone
3. I developed self awareness and mental strength to face almost everything..
4. I am learning patience and detachment as I speak
5. I become more spiritual and aware of people's feelings and emotions.
6. I am hopeful and optimistic in a way I always wanted to be. I'm returning to my old 13-15 year old self who was confident and boss babe in herself.
7. And on random basis, I attracted free coffees, chocolates, animals and babies , angel numbers and gifts.

But I struggle with completely embodying it as I feel that I sometimes still am not enough or will he make a move? My biggest limiting belief currently is He feels all this but will not make a move.

Since the year is ending, I just wanted to say I'm really grateful to have found this sub and the journey I went through.
I have always heard about Manifestation but never really believed it. I stumbled upon this sub while I was nursing a heartbreak and giving up on a relationship with someone who is my soulmate. I don't believe in signs but I feel I was always meant to find out and question my views of Laws and Manifesting the day I decided to give up on my love story.

It's funny, I got into these rabbit holes to manifest a sp but returned with myself while and new.

My goal was to Manifest my Sp loving me... Currently, it is to find love the one I deserve from the man who I know my Sp is. 
Read the previous line again. 
I believe and Know my Sp shows up as the Man of my dreams, my true soulmate and partner even though in 3d our story has suddenly paused and we are in no contact. I'm aware that my past beliefs led that but I also know my current beliefs have so much for me in store.

Since starting and learning about the laws and manifestation, I was able to:
1. Heal my own traumatic wounds and Depression I had since 14 (I'm 26 now). I was able to face myself, revise, script and create a new identity for myself through self concept work and challenging my limiting beliefs. For me this is my biggest accomplishment. I feel so 🦚 of myself for this one.
2. Was able to form and reconnect with so many of my old friends I lost contact with or had terrible fights. In a way they took were my sps in friendship and I got three of them back in this year alone
3. I developed self awareness and mental strength to face almost everything..
4. I am learning patience and detachment as I speak
5. I become more spiritual and aware of people's feelings and emotions.
6. I am hopeful and optimistic in a way I always wanted to be. I'm returning to my old 13-15 year old self who was confident and boss babe in herself.
7. And on random basis, I attracted free coffees, chocolates, animals and babies , angel numbers and gifts.

My 18 Month Dachshund just threw up and it looked like the inside of a dragonfruit!,"I flushed the vomit before thinking to get a picture (I heard her dry heaving so I put a bowl in front of her) but this is very similar to what it looked like. White/foamy with a lot of black/black seeds. (No pink or browns)

She’s acting completely fine. No loss in appetite, running and playing as normal, drinking her water, and her stool is healthy looking.

The consistency was mucus-y (it held together instead of a liquid).

It wasn’t similar to some of these “coffee grounds vomit” images I’ve seen so I’m not 100% sure what to do at the moment.

If anyone has any recommendations or has seen commit similar to what I’m describing, I’m all ears! 🙏

2 hour update: she ate her breakfast in its entirety, drank plenty of water, and now we’re outside and she’s running/zooming as if nothing happened. I’m still watching her closely, all advice is appreciated ❤️",2,1734813434.0,AskVet,1,1.0,False

About me: I'm 23 and I go to school for forensics. I like to play games (board games, video games, dnd, etc.), watch horror movies, go thrifting (I'm really into fashion/style), try new coffee/tea places, write, skate and take hikes/walks. 

I'm 6'1, skinny, tan skin, curly brown hair to my shoulders, brown eyes, and I usually dress more alternative/goth/dark.

I'd say for my personality, I'm very down-to-earth but also full of energy/socialness, curious/adventurous, open-minded, creative, and just generally easy-going and fun-loving. My love language is quality time, and my personality type is ENFP.

After talking to my therapist, he thinks it's a good idea to catalogue what's been going on, ""give your mind some space to breathe"" as he put it. So, here I am, writing everything out so my brain feels less busy. If anyone is interested in what's been going on, I'll leave a link to my original post down below. I took some time to familiarize myself with the apartment and my neighborhood, looking for work and some friends. For only $700 a month in the city, it isn't too bad! I have a little corner store I can get groceries from,  a dog park I can go to, and I found a rec center I can hopefully make some friends! Things are looking up for sure, despite my parents breathing down my neck about grad school. As far as the weird diary I found, though, I hate to say it's been getting worse. I put it down for a few days after my random mindless reading episode, hoping I'd just forget about it. I immediately started feeling ill, though. Tossing and turning all night, stomachaches, the works. The worst was the tremors, though. The whole next few days after reading from it, I kept getting what felt like tiny electric jolts all the way through my body. I looked gray my mom told me, and nothing I was doing would make the sensations go away. I tried to sleep it off, and I think I slept something like 14 hours straight. You know when you wake up from a nap and you can't remember what year it is, where you are, that sort of feeling? I woke up with that. It sucked. My room still isn't really furnished yet either, so the creaky floorboards were sounded especially freaky. Nothing to soak up the sound I guess. I was definitely wigged out. It didn't help that the creepy diary was sitting on my bedside table too.

I really didn't want to read it, but not having many friends or family nearby has been a bit boring ya know? It was something to do, I guess, especially because I couldn't sleep anyway. So yeah, I read more of it, and you know what? I felt a little better.  I'm not much for horror writing, but it was like I was in the zone, like when I'm studying and feeling productive. I got to what I thought was a decent place to stop, just as the birds started chirping outside. I feel like at this point I'm more curious about it than I am spooked by it. But, more than anything, I am BEAT. I'll leave what I read again, mostly for me but also for anyone else interested haha. Gonna take a nap, hoping I'll be able to sleep better knowing I'm following my therapist's advice.

“P-Please, help me, I-I don’t know where–” 

I held my hand up impatiently, beads of his rose-colored mucus already dirtying more of my floor. To my surprise, he obeyed, his mouth clamping shut with a hollow thud, mustache twitching anxiously. I swallowed my annoyed sigh, lips pursed and brow furrowed at the Cats’ carelessness. Pinching the bridge of my nose, I tried to exhale the annoyance away, my free hand dancing swiftly through the air. A beautiful leather recliner sprang to attention from behind my desk, achy coils shaking themselves awake as it floated toward the man. I shambled toward my desk with effort, ducking under the chair as it descended awkwardly before its now-shrieking recipient. That haze of indifference lowered over me once more, the rhythmic thumping of my crutch grounding me for long enough to make it to my desk. I parked myself on a creaky wooden chair behind it, resting my crutch against the bookshelf robotically. The backpack collided with my desk in a muffled *PFFF*, a thin layer of dust creating streaks of light as my gaze shifted back to my first Overnighter. His squealing abruptly stopped, his mangled face settling on a silent scream as I gestured for him to sit. His bathrobe clung to his shoulders stiffly, a pungent mix of coffee and fresh cut grass releasing from his shirt as my recliner adjusted to his weight. His eye flitted about the room in discontent, his meaty, calloused hand anxiously whipping thin gray hairs out of his face. I wondered how long I could draw out the tension; like a delinquent schoolboy, the man sat in quiet anticipation, desperate to hear his punishment so the anxiety would leave him. Most who find themselves sitting in a pool of their own blood are much less still, let alone attentive. Despite his own eye socket drooling cherry red viscera, all he could muster in the moment were steady, stifled whimpers. I was almost impressed, the feeling lingering long enough for my phone to tear through the silence:

“Hello! Overnight Profile #1: 

Name: Albert “Al” Clancey

Age: 67 years, 5 months, 27 days

Nationality: American

Religion: Christian

COD: GSW to the Eye (L)”

*Coulda guessed that one, Phone.*

“P-Please,” he stammered, “I-I don’t know who you are, but I have to find my boy–”

I raised my hand once more, a huff of protest caught on his lips. “He’s here too. Somewhere, I’m sure,” I said in weak reassurance.

A flash of hope appeared for the Overnighter, his dread halted momentarily. His weathered rosy cheeks had smudges of dirt hiding beneath the blood, a choked sob echoing in the room. After a pregnant pause, I watched his face contort slowly, those same dirt smudges peeling free as a scowl morphed his face. 

“T-They had him by the throat,” he muttered weakly, his lone eye forcing out a steady stream of tears. “He was so scared–”

“They’re gone now, Al. You’re safe here. He is safe, too.” My eyes shifted unconsciously to the floor, a new pool of blood and pulp forming. 

“A-Are you sure? How can you know? I don’t even know who you are, I don’t know where I am, I-I-I don’t know where that random cat went–”

I shushed him for a third time, agitation mixing with his confusion like salt and water, threatening to boil over. “I can look him up,” I answered flatly, trying to coax his anger back. “Look, if I go here. . .”

I turned my phone to face him, my makeup hot against the office lights. I navigated through the scrawling list of names, Al’s eye desperately trying to process them all. It took a few minutes, but I instinctually paused over a name, Al’s face softening in response. 

“Profile Name: James Clancey

Would you like to Continue? ”

“No,” I said, my voice drifting into the room hoarsely.

Al’s shoulders relaxed, his mustache burying his mouth. His gaze shifted to me, a lone brown eye staring through me, glassy and thoughtless. As if ripped back to reality, his fingers raced up to his empty socket, delicately tracing the line of crimson down to his jawline. A new wave of fear pulled the color from his face once more, his already pallor skin taking on a new gray hue. 

“Wh-What happened to me?”

Despite the answer staring back at me from my phone, I gathered there was more to that question than just, “you got shot in the face, Al”. Tangling my leg with the chair’s legs, I leaned forward onto the backpack, my elbows digging into the faces within. 

“What do you remember?” I offered.

“J-James told me he’d be right back.” His lips retreated into his mouth once more, his tongue flicking moisture from his moustache onto the hardwood. “He. . . It was only a few minutes at most, I’m sure of it. Those damn Virmani twins, I kept telling him not to hang around that crew!” A curtain of anguish surrounded Al, a new batch of sobs ripped from his beet red face. “If only I wasn’t so damn sick! I’d’ve been able to actually do something! His deadbeat, sack of shit father was probably out stuffing coke up his nose again too, not like he cared about his boy at all.” He spat a glob of pink mucus onto my floor in indignation, the mere mention of the boy’s father seemingly rejected by his mouth.

I shifted in the chair, my leg twitching reflexively. *Almost there, Al*. 

He paused, eyes glassy and wet. “I h-heard. . . shouts. A gunshot. I remember being angry, sad, sick. I remember getting my robe caught on that fucking screen door Mark said he’d fix, the bastard. I-It was cold outside, oh God James was probably so cold. . .” A stifled sob escaped once more, Al wringing his hands as more blood pooled at his feet. “H-He looked so helpless in that Virmani boy’s hands. I-I didn’t know what to do, what could I have done? I tried to get help, I really did! When I turned to run back inside, though, my stomach started to hurt real. . . real bad. I heard another shot, and then. . . and then. . .”

A rush of bewilderment crossed his face, the clouds in his eyes parting as shock began to set in. “I-I don’t remember. Why can’t I remember?” His sweaty hand pushed hair from his forehead once more, gently trembling as he affixed it to his temple thoughtfully. Despite his shock, there was an air of ease about him now; a foreign sense of calm descended over him, as if his sudden amnesia stole the fear away with his memory.

“T-There was a cat I remember. I don’t remember where it came from, though. Oh god, my little Jimmy. . .” As quickly as the calm came, it vanished instantly, his face puckering in effort. Unable to delay the sadness any longer, Al scream-cried in the recliner freely, pink phlegm flying as he mourned his grandson. Grief has a strange sense of humor; sometimes, once you feel like you’ve gotten it all out, grief makes it sit, festering and underripe. Just when you think it's passed, that’s when it hits you, and it hits you hard. The pain, the fear, the sad, and sometimes even joy come avalanching out in a cesspool of disorganized emotion. Grief’s one of those things that is too foreign, too complex, too extravagant for the brain to handle all at once – hence the “Five Stages” and all that. Despite all of its intensity, its cruelty, its crushing weight, I couldn’t help but respect it. Chaos unlike anything imaginable, it had a surgical precision when it came to stripping away the soul. All you’re left with is a blank slate, nowhere else to look but straight ahead, into the future. Breathtaking. Predictably, I admired its ability to get the job done.

The numbness surrounding me held firm as Al belted out waves of heart wrenching wails, twinges of leg pain pulsing in time with his grief like a cruel metronome. The feeling anchored me once more, bits of stray mucus dotting my desk. A broken soul laid bare before me, steadily breathing cold life into this stagnant office, yet I’m cursed to be grief’s cruel accomplice. *I’m sorry Al, I really am. It’s time to move to the future, though.*

“You’ll have time to grieve Al, I promise,” I croaked, softening the cries lightly. “Unfortunately for both of us, however, we have to get you processed.”

A fresh sputter of frustration belted out from Al, stray mustache hairs releasing silently as he rocketed to his feet, hands slamming onto my desk. “You haven’t given me ONE straight answer since I’ve been here, while I’ve been dumping my entire life story for you. And for what?! I didn’t sign up for no fuckin’ therapy session; you’re gonna tell me who the fuck you are and where the fuck we are RIGHT. NOW.”

His face a few inches from mine, I could feel his hot breath and spittle spreading over my foundation, his burly hands smudging the pristine desktop in rage. “Alright Al, alright. You’re right. You and I both want nothing more than for you to leave and for me to never see you again, right? Then let’s get rolling okay?” I cleared my throat, Al’s knuckles relaxing ever so slightly. With apprehension, he released the desk, his flushed cheeks jiggling as he plopped back into the recliner. 

My eyes flutter closed for a moment, my composure shifting back to its typical, bureaucratic authority. “Do you, Albert Clancey, affirm that you died on September 19th at 23:17?”

Silence.

“Guess I thought my eye was just swollen shut. . .” Limply, he nodded.

“And do you, Albert Clancey, wish to pass on as a Christian?”

“Ain’t got any other choice, right?”

Silence.

“Y-Yes, I would.” 

“Last bit, I promise: would you, Albert Clancey, wish to pass on your life’s experience in order to shape future generations?” *Please say no.*

“As long as my boy’s alright like you say, it don’t matter.” His cheeks sagged morosely as he wheezed out the answer, the last bits of grief finally falling away. *Thank you, Al. I don’t think I could’ve started today with that*.

“Very well then. I have all I need from you; as of this moment, Albert Clancey, you are officially processed. Your patience and respect are duly noted.” My mouth felt dry, my lips already cracking from the overhead lights beating down. *Woof. One down*. Before either of us could relax, our fated interrogation concluded, my phone breached the silence yet again with an echoing buzz.

“Overnighter Albert “Al” Clancey: Complete!”

“Remaining: 138,205”

Blinking slowly, I covered my phone with the bag, silencing my all-too-cheery assistant. Lips drawn tightly, I motioned for Al to stand as his color slowly returned, his bloodstained cheeks taking on a warmer hue. *I wonder if they were that rosy in life*. I ushered him to the door cordially, a trail of his bloody footprints forming next to me as we shuffled to the far end of my office.

“Y-You’re takin’ me to see Jimmy, right?” Distress bubbling up inside him, Al looked like he was caught between reservation and candor, lingering bits of anger trying to strengthen his voice. I’ve been in the business long enough, though, and spoke through his facade.

“It isn’t up to me, Al. Either my Cats or Vivi will clean you up, fix your bleeding.” I apologized for the wounds, my crutch thumping noisily alongside our stroll. “If you go out these doors again, you’ll be escorted to Vivi. From there they’ll take care of you. Thanks again.”

“But is he safe, truly?”

I paused at the doors, their glass doorknobs shining eagerly. “Truly.”

Al’s demeanor finally shifted, a contentedness now emanating from him. It lasted long enough for me to motion for the door, a streak of panicked uncertainty welling up in him through shaky breaths. My office doors stood expectantly, the gold inlay slightly shimmering. His eye jumped between me and the doors, the sense of foreboding freezing him in place. With as much reassurance as this face could muster, I flashed him a hollow smile, my free hand feebly attempting to push the door open for him. I mouthed the word “magic” as the office doors creaked open, a gush of cold air escaping from behind them, threatening to knock me on my ass. My crutch catching me harshly, Al replaced my hand on the door, a similar smile cloaking his unease. He tested the cold with his leg, a ripple of frigid air subtly refreshing the stagnant office.

“T-Thanks for the, um, processing, I guess. Miss. . .”

“Mori,” I answered. “Just Mori.”

With so many options on the internet, I am unsure which grinder to choose. I primarily single dose and prefer medium to dark-roasted coffee :) My girlfriend drinks cappuccino. I drink espresso and cappuccinos.
We usually have one coffee in the morning and occasionally another after lunch.
We are based in the EU, so import taxes are a thing, if shipped from outside of the EU. (e.g the Niche zero costs about 750€ with taxes and import duties)

Price point can be up to 1000€ but can be crossed by a bit.

While browsing the web and watching YouTube videos, we came across these options:
(Prices here are with taxes)
- Timemore Sculptor 078S [810€]
- Varia VS6 Grinder [995€]
- Mazzer Philos [995€]
- Niche Zero [750€]
- DF64V [540€] and DF83V [830€] (DF83 without Variable speed costs about 550€)
- Mignon Single Dose Pro [650€]

My girlfriend really likes the Timemore. It seems difficult to open, clean, or switch out the burr. But else, it looks really good.

My boyfriend and I have been together for around 3 years. The relationship had a rocky start as he had a lot of insecurities regarding cheating, subject of which he felt very strongly about as his mom was really toxic and jealous with his dad.

A couple of months ago, I was watching memes on his phone while mine charged, as we had no problem using each other's phones, when suddenly I got curious, and (I know it was wrong of me) opened his messages to search for the word ""girlfriend"" to see what he talked about me with other people..
 I found an old chat that called my attention, from like a month after we started dating, where he flirted with a girl telling her that she was really pretty and he wished he didn't have a girlfriend.

 I know it was old and it wasn't much but it made me really angry because I thought I could really trust him and that he was the kind of person who would never ever do things like that. 

I saved the screenshots and confronted him to which he first denied everything saying he didn't remember, and would never say something like that, however after those irrefutable screenshots he apologized saying he was immature at the time and he just wanted to make friends but didn't know how to and said stupid things.

I accepted his apology and decided to leave it behind because it was a long time ago and he had changed a lot since then, so...whatever. it's fine.

Now what brought me here...
A few days ago, he went out with a female coworker to get a coffee after work, which was ok for me, and I even encouraged it as he has no real friends and often feels lonely. He came back happy, told me they walked around town just talking about stuff and that he was happy to have found someone who connected with him and with whom he felt comfortable building a friendship with. Awesome.

Two days later he started acting really weird and told me that he was unsure of what to do as this girl has confessed she has feelings for him. 

Reminder: They've known each other for TWO weeks.

 Anyways, I tried not to think bad about it, believe that women and men can be friends, and told him that he should establish clear boundaries if he still wanted to be friends with her and that if he interested her as a friend, she would respect that and keep those feelings aside or, what I expected, she would just stop talking to him when she realized he was not going to give her what she wanted. 

He understood, agreed, told me he would handle it and left me feeling okay about it. 

The day after I could not shake the feeling that maybe something else could have happened and went through his messages only to find he had deleted the chat... which was suspicious as hell.

So I went on his computer and, don't ask me how,  retrieved those messages.

He would send her pictures (that I couldn't see as they were temporary) and she would reply things like ""You are so gorgeous I want those lips, those eyes, all of you"" and he would reply with hearts. Then other messages where she would say that she was jealous of me, and that she would wait for him to give him all the love that he deserved and that she wanted to cry in his arms and laugh and ""stay warm"" with him in the winter and so much shit like that even tiktoks like ""I wish we where them"" of couples cuddling and he would reply with more hearts...
I swear I started shivering with rage to see that he was, yeah maybe not being as explicit as this girl was, but still reciprocating what she was saying by replying with hearts or saying ""I adore you"" back to her or stuff like that. 

I have not told him that I saw those messages, and I do not know what to do as we are currently living together, in a different city without anyone else.
 How do I handle this? I do not think I can trust him anymore as I never thought he would do this.

1hjidgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanic/comments/1hjidgp/i_dont_know_where_else_to_go_from_here/,I don't know where else to go from here,"i recently bought a 2009 second gen Prius 1.5L, it has a coolant leak *somewhere*. I don't know what more to do to find it.

when i bought the car i knew it had its problems, but it has a new hybrid battery and the engine is healthy. I figured it would be a cheap project car to occupy my time. I drove it to pick up some prescriptions into town, about a 20 mile drip, everything was fine, the next day i topped off the coolant and made sure it was burped \\ bled properly, and started my 60 mile round trip to the DMV. it had lost very little coolant on the first trip so i thought i would be fine getting it registered. About halfway there i could hear something that sounded like a pressurized leak, like a steam leak, then the car started to overheat (i kept a scantool plugged into it to monitor temps) once it hit 205 i stopped and shut it down, had it towed home, almost all the coolant was gone.

the next day i refilled the system and burped it again, took over a gallon. i put my pressure tester on it and pumped it to 13psi and could find no signs of leaking. so i tried again after getting the engine up to operating temperature. still no signs of leaks. both hoses were hard and pressurized like you would expect, but they were barely warm, and i know the tstat had opened. i would want my coffee to be hotter than this. the radiator cap was cold.

i'm at a loss as to where to go from here, any advice would be appreciated, thank you.",1,1734812800.0,mechanic,3,1.0,False
1hjid6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hjid6d/just_listen/,Just Listen,"It was usually at the furthest Lagrange Point of whatever star system it found itself in, but today it took orbit around the capital of the Loopee Confederation. So is tradition, for the council takes no sides, favors no one and its seat must reflect that, has reflected that since time immemorial.



The Galactic Council has no capital, for it has no center. All members are equally close, equally distant from its designs, its protection, its power. But physics, biology, the laws that govern reality care not for the abstract values of their creations, so, call it a Capital, call it a meeting point, call it the dream of a cat both alive and dead, it is what it is, and what it is is a space station where representatives of all member-species meet to set their common policy, one hand, beak, claw or tentacle shake at a time.



Being an object that exists, the station must occupy a place in spacetime and, for tradition, this is the homestar of the speaker currently in office. Not his planet or moon, but star, at its most distant stable orbit possible. For the speaker doesn’t rule the Council, so the Council doesn’t follow him to his home.



But not today.



Today the station takes a trip to Speaker Vintara’s homeworld. A token of gratitude for the services provided to the Council, an opportunity for her to take one look at her home before heading to a distant star, a symbolic gesture, another tradition.



From here, the endless discussions on trade, law, subsidies don’t seem so abstract. From here, one can see the purple forests of Loolara giving way to the city lights at the twilight line, the dance of the white clouds over the blue oceans and the fiery trail of the countless ships reentering the atmosphere popping all around, like a calm rain of shooting stars, watched from above. But at Speaker Vintara’s table all eyes are lazily gazing at their drinks, claws, paws.



\-It was you who gave the final approval for the human entry into the Council, wasn’t it? - asks Emissary Tin’Ra.

\-I don’t remember you opposing it, in fact, I recall you being quite enthusiastic when casting your vote for the humans admittance! - replies Toovok.

\-Easy, my noble colleague. I’m not accusing you of anything.

\-My apologies. I assume the last decicycles have been as taxing on me as they’ve been on all here present.



\-Aye, aye. - The table answers in a lazy, disjointed chorus, before falling into an awkward silence for a moment.



\-I was curious, you see. - Tin’Ra breaks the silence once again - It’s not that uncommon for a new species to be invited to the Council, after all, who doesn’t want a friendly, inexperienced emissary on his side, who relies exclusively on you to show the inner workings of interstellar politics? But when the Nareekan endorsed the Yowian invite, I had to meet whoever it was that had those two agree on something for once.

\-That’s why you were so welcoming to him? - inquiries emissary Luvrin.

\-“Him”. It doesn’t feel right to address Said this way even now. - Toovok blabs, still looking down at his glass.



The table nods in agreement. It isn’t that those senior members of the council don’t understand Earth’s emissary is as sentient as any other colleague, but his behavior has driven them to treat him more like a piece of furniture.



\-So where did your Rakan curiosity lead the noble colleague? - asks Luvrin.

\-Mild disappointment, extreme boredom. - The table chuckles discreetly - We all know Said, you can utter the most outrageous statement or show him the most mind breaking event, all he ever answers is…



\-“I understand”! - The table chorus goes, this time with a faint hint of enthusiasm.



With the feathers at the back of her head raising slightly, Luvrin asks:



\-Has anyone ever heard Said speak anything else?

\-“Salt”, - Toovok answers - when a waiter asked if he wanted anything in his drink.

\-Must’ve been an awfully boring drink.

\-It was most certainly not. This was the “Sky High Incident”.

\-So you were the poor soul assigned as referee to that brawl?

\-Not much need for a referee in a free for all.

\-What drove the noble colleagues to get into a fist fight?

\-Who can tell? You know how it is with species who talk through chemical exchange. My translator was working overtime, trying to make sense of the words they shouted over each other. Before I knew what was happening, one had spilled Said’s coffee over the other, still not sure if on purpose or accident.

\-Shhhhhh! - The table hiss.

\-Yes, dear colleagues, not a pleasant sight, a gelatinous individual drenched in human stimulant. It took hours for maintenance to detach him from the roof.

\-Where was Said in the midst of all that?

\-Ordering a second coffee.



The table chuckles.



\-By the time our Moorilan colleague decided melding with the ceiling was his purpose in life, Said just sat there with the Ra’linn representative as he went on and on, the coffee getting cold, while I desperately tried to remind our intoxicated friend the correct directions of up and down.

\-That’s Said. - says Tin’Ra - The world burns around him and he does nothing but bounce his head up and down, eventually uttering those two single words he seems to know…

\-“I understand”!

  


Vintara stops playing with the ice cubes, by now almost completely melted. Taking her beak out of her glass for the first time of the night, she takes a deep look at her former opponents in the bygone election.



\-Well, he must have done something right. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be heading to Sol.

1hjick4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTheTraveler/comments/1hjick4/do_you_need_a_tour_for_south_rim_grand_canyon/,Do you need a tour for South Rim Grand Canyon?,"Just got back from an incredible Grand Canyon South Rim bus tour from Las Vegas - Here's my honest review + tips & tricks!

Hey fellow travelers! I recently took a day trip from Vegas to explore the Grand Canyon South Rim, and I need to share this amazing experience with you all. After comparing different tours, I went with this one [affiliate link: https://athometouch.com/SouthRim] and honestly, it exceeded my expectations.

The tour started early (around 6 AM) with a hotel pickup - I actually appreciated the early start because it meant more time at the canyon. Our driver Mike was hilarious and kept us entertained during the ride with interesting facts about the Mojave Desert and local history.

The bus was surprisingly comfortable - clean, spacious, and equipped with a bathroom (trust me, this is crucial for a 14-hour tour). We made a quick breakfast stop in Kingman, Arizona, where I grabbed some coffee and snacks.

The real magic happened when we reached the South Rim. Guys, photos don't do this place justice. Our first stop was Mather Point, and I literally stood there speechless for a good five minutes. The vastness of the canyon, the layers of red rock, and the way sunlight plays on the formations - it's mind-blowing.

Pro tip: I upgraded to include the helicopter ride ($199 extra) and it was WORTH EVERY PENNY. Seeing the canyon from above gives you a completely different perspective. If you can swing it financially, do it!

We visited multiple viewpoints throughout the day, including Bright Angel Point, which offers some of the most spectacular views I've ever seen. The meal voucher included with the tour came in handy - I had lunch at the Bright Angel Lodge while enjoying the canyon views.

Some practical advice:
- Bring a light jacket (it can get chilly at the rim)
- Wear comfortable walking shoes
- Pack snacks and water
- Don't forget your camera!
- Book in advance, especially during peak season

For $80, this tour is an absolute steal. Everything was well-organized, from the pickup to the various stops. If you're staying in Vegas and want to experience one of the world's natural wonders, this is the way to do it.

Feel free to ask any questions in the comments! Happy to share more details about my experience.

P.S. - If you're on the fence about this tour, just do it. It's one of those bucket-list experiences that you'll remember forever.",1,1734812724.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

For context, we live in about a level 7 hoard. You can’t walk through the majority of the house from all the clutter and/or mold. 

I found out my parents were going on a 2 month long winter break vacation, and knew this was the only chance I’d get to declutter without them interfering. So the only people left in my house is my brother and i. I knew (or at least I thought) that my brother was indifferent to the mess as he stays in his room all day. He’s gotten used to the hoard and influenced my parents to not care either. He leaves his dirty plates and trash all around the housr and on top of the hoard piles because my parents always cleaned up after him. Regardless, i thought he honestly wouldn’t do anything once i started cleaning. 

It took me about 6 hours to sort just the kitchen area and pantry. I haven’t seen my kitchen like this since I was a little kid and it honestly made me so emotional. Anyway, I threw out about 6 completely full/stretched out garbage bags full of junk and expired food. I was able to actually fit ALL the still good food INSIDE THE PANTRY!!! Before, the pantry and dining area was completely filled with expired food bought in bulk. I remember finding literal baby formula tubs stashed in there from when i was a baby. My parents resorted to putting all the new groceries in the living room area. 

Anyway, i was shocked when i saw this morning that half the shit i neatly organized into the pantry was laying right back out in the living room. My brother had gone back and moved his goddamn bulk box of starbucks coffee bottles and the huge chips container (and half the other garbage). He also made a fuss about all the garbage bags I threw out, and how we could’ve kept half the shit. Specifically, the ROTTING tupperware that was stained and had some (idk what they are) things LIVING ON IT??? WHAT? I just don’t know what to do. I have a feeling he’s gonna keep moving things out and he knows I’ll just clean it back up after him. Ugh. Hes a grown man and feels so comfortable with this shit hole that he INVITES PEOPLE OVER and no one says a goddamn thing. I just cant anymore.",12,1734812548.0,ChildofHoarder,5,1.0,False

She has a few plants, and is worried about them being okay when she’s not home during the day and overnight, since the living room area of the cabin will dip below the cold tolerance for most tropical plants. She’s currently running an electric space heater near them, but that’s expensive to run 24/7. Would a heating pad be enough to keep a 2-3 ft tall coffee plant alive? It has a lot of sentimental value, so she doesn’t want to take any chances. I’ve offered to “babysit” over the winter, but my thumb isn’t the greenest. 😅 Any other ideas would be appreciated!
