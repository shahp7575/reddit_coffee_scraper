However... I have long since suspected bipolar, but a psychiatrist refused to even evaluate me because I have had trauma in the past, and she attributed the highs and lows to that. It's been years since then, and it can no longer be explained away. I hadn't reconsidered bipolar however, until my GP suspected it when I contacted her for depression.  
I was put on wellbutrin. My symptoms of depression have improved somewhat. Now I'm wondering if what I'm feeling and doing is just ""not depression"", or if I'm closing in on mania.  
I have crazy dreams, but don't necessarily sleep less. I was out weeding late at night last night. I'm getting. shit. done. Making lists, picking up slack and dealing with loose ends. I had coffee this morning because I have term papers I havent started (thanks depression), but now feel crazy jittery and rambly and all over the place. That could just be the coffee though.

1knvid9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1knvid9/why_wont_he_meet_me_after_7_years_of_talking/,Why won't he meet me after 7 years of talking online?  Advice needed.,"So this is a weird situation.

I've been talking to a guy on and off for about 7 years now, of all the places we ""met"" it was the Facebook comments where he got into a friendly dispute with my mum about something and I stuck up for her. We both worked in the same field so just got chatting via messenger, and 7 years later we still are.

Conversation has always been friendly and above board, no flirting and nothing of that nature. He travels around the world with his job, so he sends me pictures and we play chess together a lot online. I disappeared for a while because I had relationship issues (DV) but got back in touch with him again once I was out of the relationship for a while - I tell him a lot about my life and he's never been judgemental or rude.

He always initiates the conversations, and we just chat about all sorts. I've found it a super positive and nice friendship to be honest, and I think he's a great guy.

However... In March, I don't know why but something changed. I had lost my job and was going through a rough patch in life, and our discussions suddenly went from being checking in every now and then to basically every day, and it's been like that ever since. We have had conversations and chess games all through the night and told each other stories and just generally chatted. All this is over text.

It's got to the point where I know what his day looks like, when he's travelling, what he's doing and he often sends me photos of himself in different places. I will do the same. I decided to do some investigation and found that he has a girlfriend who he's been with for about 18 years by the look of it. They don't live together, he's against marriage, against kids - doesn't want any of that. She has photos of them on her Facebook, he has none on his. He has NEVER mentioned her in the whole time we've been chatting despite no flirting or anything sexual being present.

But what I am picking up on is... something. I don't know what, but something. I have no idea when he even sees his girlfriend because the chatting is so constant between us. He keeps referring to a coffee debt that I owe him for losing chess games (our conversation is very much roasting each other and insulting each other amongst general chat) but he never actually wants to meet. He finally said he'd come over... but it was 4am so that's not viable for me - had to be up in the morning. He said he'll take me out to a certain place... then he sends me a photo of him there with a work colleague. It's just very strange.

Why though? There is a heck of a lot of time and effort going into all this discussion time wise, and he's more than happy to share details of the fact he's well off and successful, I had daily updates and photos on his skiing holiday a few weeks ago, he'll send me VMs of the guitar solos he is practising. I just don't get it. Very confused, and the issue is.... I've started getting feelings now which has never happened in the whole time I've been talking to him.

Interested in some opinions on this. He's got a very dim view of conventional life by the looks of it - eg: Marriage because his money will be taken etc. I don't know if that adds any context.",1,1747382860.0,AskMenAdvice,5,1.0,False

Last year during placements, I got selected by a company and later joined a Telegram group with all the other selected students. That’s where I started talking to this one person (let’s call her A). We didn’t talk much, just occasionally about the company procedures and such. I also helped her out quite a bit from time to time. I knew I was overhelping her and probably wouldn’t get anything in return, but I did it anyway.

Cut to a few months later, both of us were called to a city by the company. I went there and started living on my own. Life was a bit lonely. One day, out of the blue, she texted me and started a conversation. We chatted a bit, and then she suddenly asked me to meet her. That really shocked me.

So we made plans to meet for coffee. Honestly, I was shaking. The fact that someone I barely knew wanted to meet and eat together was overwhelming. My friends told me this was a good opportunity to make a friend. I agreed, thinking the same.

So, I went to meet her, still shaking. We sat across from each other. I was so nervous that while showing her the menu, I couldn’t even turn the pages properly. Still, I tried to keep the conversation going. I asked her about herself, and she asked me some things too. There were a few awkward silences, but both of us tried to push through. She even mentioned we could meet somewhere else next time, which I took as a positive sign. I paid the bill.

After coming back home around 4 PM, I felt happy. Friends advised me to wait before texting her, so I did. But as the hours passed and it got close to 11 PM, I hadn’t heard from her. So, I texted her saying it was a nice day. She replied with one-liners, which made me wonder if she wasn’t really interested. I ended the conversation quickly.

A few days later, she texted me asking if I was in the office, even though I had already told her my office schedule. I clarified I wasn’t, and the conversation ended right there.

I kept waiting for her to mention the next meet-up, she had said she'd pay next time, but she never brought it up. I tried texting her again, asking about her day and following up on things she had shared with me when we met, but again, I got one-liners. That was my final straw. I stopped contacting her after that and decided to move on and ignore her completely.

We currently live in an apartment complex and his family (mom, brother, and sister) all live on the first floor and we live on the second. We also have a dog. My bfs brother has spare key to our place that stays on his key ring. He will occasionally come up and grab our dog for a walk if we’re both busy and both give him permission to do so. My bfs sister moved back in with their mom a few months ago and honestly, she’s not that great. She would constantly say I was the reason my bf stopped giving her money and stopped caring for her. She’s 2 years older than him (we’re both 21). My bf worked today and he always needs his headphones since he makes a lot of calls at work. I left our place later in the day, so after 5, no one was home. We both got home together and when we did, my bf was quick to realize some headphones were on our coffee table. They are the same brand just different model so he was confused because for a second he thought they were his but realized his were actually in his pocket. He opened them and saw that they were his sisters (she has a different color but the case they come in are the same). I started to freak out a bit because right before I left, I was doing some exercises and I moved the coffee table and cleaned it up and didn’t notice ANY headphones. And like I said, my bfs needs his headphones for work so if I had noticed them, I would have been quick to text him to let him know he forgot them. He texted his brother asking if him or their sister were up in our apartment and he said no but his sister called him right after and said that he grabbed them on Tuesday by accident when he was visiting their apartment. My bf started doubting himself but the thing is, if they have been there since Tuesday, how did we BOTH not notice? My bfs headphone case are very beat up because of how much he used them, and hers is the opposite. I also found it weird she didn’t bug him about her headphones for two days considering how possessive she is over her things. We also ate on the coffee table this morning and didn’t see any headphones. The only thing that makes my bf and I doubt she was here is because his brother has the key on him and he went to work and he also doesn’t give her the key. I trust him because he is genuine so now I feel bad because I don’t know what to do. His sister just has a history of being a bitch so I kind of already just want to put the blame on her.


I suggested to my bf for us to just act like it really was our fault and we didn’t notice the headphones until now, while also placing a camera and not telling them about it. Does that sound like a good idea? I can also just asks for the key back but I fear that would make it obvious we don’t trust them, same if we just change the lock.

1knvghz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contemporary_Romance/comments/1knvghz/my_divorce_lawyer_is_pursuing_me_novel_roseanne/,"My Divorce Lawyer Is Pursuing Me Novel - “Roseanne, let's get a divorce!”","Chapter 1 A Life Of Luxury

“Roseanne, let's get a divorce!”

Standing before Roseanne Sylvester was Brandon Graham, her husband of two years from a whirlwind marriage.

He was clad in a sleek black trench coat, his handsome face void of any unnecessary expressions. His gaze toward her held a hint of apology. “I'm now with Yvonne.”

Roseanne stood dumbfounded at the door, her large pajamas draped over her body, highlighting her slender figure. It took her a couple of seconds to comprehend his words. “She doesn't know you're married?”

Two years ago, Egrea had experienced a sudden outbreak of a highly contagious disease, which had caused countless deaths and injuries.

At that time, Brandon had just graduated from his postgraduate studies and joined a top-notch hospital in the country. Upon learning about the situation, he resolutely decided to go abroad as a volunteer to provide support.

Back then, they had just gotten their marriage certificate.

Two years had passed and the first thing he did upon returning to his homeland was, astonishingly, to propose a divorce. Even more shocking was that his affair was with the darling daughter of the Scott family.

Brandon explained, “Our marriage registration was rushed. She was among the first volunteers, and she didn't know.”

Sarcasm played at the corners of Roseanne's lips. “So, you concealed the fact that you were already married when you pursued her?”

“I didn't,” Brandon hurriedly denied, a hint of regret flickering in his eyes. “The epidemic was fraught with danger. Yvonne repeatedly risked her life to save me. As we fought the disease together, time made our hearts grow fonder of each other. Roseanne, our marriage was rushed and there's no love between us. If it weren't for your father saving my grandfather, this union wouldn't have taken place. Yvie and I, on the other hand, share a deep understanding and mutual affection. Our love is genuine.”

Roseanne scoffed. She could barely suppress the smirk tugging at the corner of her lips. “It was you who made the promise to me. Don't make it sound as if I forced you into getting married.”

Having missed out on twenty years of familial affection, she felt like an outsider in the Sylvester family. Brandon's promise was like a warm embrace in the coldest winter, offering her a status that allowed her to remain.

Driven by a sense of gratitude, when Graham Group was in a financial crisis, she stepped in to take charge. She invested in the business, taught herself business studies, economics, and management, and worked tirelessly day and night to help the company weather the storm.

When Brandon's grandpa ,Kayden Graham, fell ill, she was constantly on the move, tirelessly seeking renowned doctors to treat him.

Her mother-in-law and sister-in-law had a fondness for jewelry, handbags, and formal dresses. Whenever they expressed a desire for something, she would purchase it without hesitation.

She was in charge of overseeing all the expenses for the Graham family, both for the business and the household.

She had given so much, only to be told that there was no love between them.

Brandon's face flushed red. “I'm sorry. Grandpa thinks highly of you, and I believed you would make an ideal wife. I followed his plans, made promises to you, and asked you to wait for me. If I hadn't met Yvonne, I would have been content to be a respectful and courteous husband to you.”

The conversation had reached its conclusion, and there was no reason for Roseanne to remain. “Fine, I consent to the divorce.”

While taken aback, Brandon also breathed a sigh of relief. He hadn't expected her to agree so readily.

After some thought, he asked, “After the divorce, will you still stay with Graham Group?”

“We'll be divorced then. Why should I stay?”

“Yvie contributed significantly to the development of a provirus inhibitor. She's successfully joined Kiefyose Medical Research Institute. I'm still in my observation period, so I'll be returning to Egrea.”

Roseanne was astonished. “A provirus inhibitor? Yvonne was involved in its development?”

Why didn't that bunch of old folks tell me?

When the topic of joining Kiefyose Medical Research Institute came up, pride filled Brandon's eyes. “Yvie is a genius in the medical field and can be considered an expert in drug research. The corporate world prioritizes self-interest, full of deception and internal strife. She's too innocent and not suited to join Graham Group. You, on the other hand, are perfectly suited for this line of work, thriving in the professional world like a fish in water. This is why Grandpa values you so much, and he might not agree to our divorce.”

Brandon's words conveyed his deep dissatisfaction with the workplace culture.

He reveled in the blissful life that wealth had afforded him, standing at the pinnacle of society. Yet, he looked down upon those who contributed to his family's fortune.

A smirk of mockery crossed Roseanne's face.

She couldn't believe she had actually once thought him to be dependable.

Brandon didn't notice the change in Roseanne's expression as he continued, “As long as you stay with Graham Group, Grandpa won't make things difficult for us. If you choose to stay, I'll give you a one percent share, which would allow you to receive dividends of several million every month.”

At this point, Roseanne couldn't help but laugh. “One percent? Do you think I care about that? You want me to divorce and make room for her, yet still expect me to clean up the mess in Graham Group and earn money for you. Where on earth would you find such a sweet deal?”

Brandon thought his offered compensation was already generous. However, Roseanne's deliberate disparagement of his company felt to him like creating unnecessary turmoil.

His face flushed with a hint of anger. “What do you mean by 'mess'? Graham Group can thrive just fine without you. Kiefyose Medical Research Institute is a world-renowned establishment. Yvie and I chose to contribute to our nation by working here. You're living a life of luxury. What more could you possibly be dissatisfied with?”

Chapter 2 Sooner Rather Than Later

Roseanne looked at him coldly. “I won't stay with Graham Group, nor do I want your shares. I own a four percent share in Graham Group, which is currently valued at about one point five billion. I'll only take what's rightfully mine.”

Brandon was stunned. “Four percent? How did you manage to own so many shares in Graham Group?”

“Two years ago, when Graham Group was facing a financial crisis, I invested five hundred million.”

Brandon frowned, utterly unconvinced. “Five hundred million for a four percent share? Since when did the Graham Group shares become so cheap?”

Brandon was aware of the crisis in Graham Group and her involvement in the company. However, nobody informed him about Roseanne's five-hundred-million investment.

Acquiring four percent of shares for five hundred million was practically a giveaway.

Thinking that she must have infiltrated the corporation and deliberately bought at a low price, he couldn't help but feel irritated.

Roseanne found it ironic and didn't want to say anything more.

Just as Brandon was about to speak again, she abruptly shut the door on him.

His expression was terribly grim as he headed to Yvonne Scott's condominium overnight.

Upon hearing Brandon's relay of Roseanne's words, Yvonne furrowed her brows. “Graham Group is enormous. A minor crisis two years ago wouldn't have shaken it to its core. The shares couldn't have possibly dropped that much. How could an investment of five hundred million secure her four percent of the shares? Most importantly, where did she get five hundred million from? I thought she was a woman of clear intentions, someone who dared to love and hate. Seems like I misjudged her. I didn't expect her to be so greedy.”

Yvonne possessed a strikingly intense appearance, marked by deeply set features. Her cold, piercing eyes gave the impression that she had everything under control, as though nothing could evade her scrutiny.

Brandon's eyes revealed his irritation. Two years ago, Roseanne had a gentle and dignified presence that seemed to complement him perfectly. However, in just two years, her luxurious lifestyle had altered her tastes. She even demanded an astounding sum of one point five billion.

“Forget about one point five billion. She'll never even get five hundred million.” Yvonne cocked an eyebrow. “She was raised in the countryside and has lived a life of luxury for two years. It's normal for her to be a bit greedy. You two don't share any emotional bond, so if she agrees to divorce without making a fuss, I can give her ten million.”

Brandon's heart softened. He pulled her into his embrace and said, “Yvie, you are truly kind-hearted. Meeting you has been my greatest fortune.”

Yvonne let out a soft humph. “She lacks education and skills. As a fellow woman, I won't make things difficult for her.”

Their eyes locked briefly before Yvonne looked away. Intrigued, Brandon scooped her up and headed toward the bed. “Yvie, it's been a while since we've been intimate.”

Without any hesitation, Yvonne shed her clothes and offered a passionate kiss.

Roseanne owned a house in the city. After deciding to divorce, she quickly packed her things and left.

She took a bath and lay in bed. The thought of not having to wake up early for Graham Group the next morning brought her immense relief and comfort.

She thought it wasn't so bad that the marriage ended.

At that moment, a new message popped up. Roseanne tapped on it. It was a message from Arthur Xanthos.

It read: Roseanne, I've reviewed the proposal. It's quite impressive. I agree to collaborate with Graham Group.

Roseanne lightly tapped the screen, typing: Old Mr. Xanthos, I'm leaving Graham Group. Please consider whether or not you wish to continue our collaboration. I can't guarantee the smooth progress of the project after my departure.

There were plenty of scoundrels in Graham Group, yet Kayden trusted them and wouldn't allow any action against them. All she could do was forcefully suppress their restless hearts.

In her absence, those lying in wait would undoubtedly lose their patience.

On the other end of the phone, an elderly man with snow-white hair rose from the couch. His once-cloudy eyes began to clear, and a smile slowly crept onto his lips.

Seeing that, the butler rushed over in a state of panic. “Old Mr. Xanthos, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?”

With a firm grip on the butler's hand and eyes gleaming, Arthur excitedly exclaimed, “Quick, find out if Roseanne is considering a divorce!”

The fact that Brandon had returned to the country was not a secret. He had known about it not too long ago.

Something major must have occurred for Roseanne to consider leaving Graham Group.

“Old Mr. Xanthos, Brandon just returned to the country. It's unlikely he could have divorced Ms. Roseanne, right?”

Arthur waved his hand dismissively. “What do you know? I've met that young man from the Graham family. He's a fool. Once Roseanne gets divorced, Calvin will have his chance. There's no time to waste. Go and find out more.”

The next day, at the crack of dawn, Roseanne received a call from Kayden and drove to the Graham residence.

She encountered Brandon and Yvonne at the main entrance.

They walked hand in hand and looked just like a newlywed couple, deeply in love and inseparable.

Their eyes met, and it was as if sparks were flashing in the air.

With a beaming smile, Eileen Ziegler emerged, cheerfully taking Yvonne's hand into hers. She gently patted it and said affectionately, “Yvie, you're here. I've missed you dearly.”

“Hello, Mrs. Graham.”

Eileen praised Yvonne before turning her attention to Roseanne. “Rosie, you've made substantial money working for Graham Group these past two years. Think of it as compensation from us. It would be best for everyone if you got your divorce papers sooner rather than later.”

Ever since Roseanne became part of the Graham family, Eileen had never made things difficult for her. It wasn't that she didn't want to, but rather, she didn't dare to.

She had thought that the girl who grew up in the countryside would be gentle and obedient, easy to handle.

Yet, as soon as Roseanne joined the family, she held the reins of power and even became the vice president of Graham Group. Eileen, despite her myriad thoughts and concerns, had to suppress them all and, ironically, ended up trying to please Roseanne instead.

To say she wasn't frustrated would be a lie. Every day, she yearned to regain the authority she once had as a mother-in-law.

Now that her son had returned to the country and was planning to divorce Roseanne, she was wholeheartedly in favor.

Eileen lifted her chin as she commanded, “You won't need to buy the anti-aging cream for me anymore. Just give me their contact information.”

A sarcastic smile curled at the corners of Roseanne's lips as she ignored Eileen. She strode through the door and headed straight for Kayden's study.

Eileen's pride was wounded, and her expression darkened instantly. “Just as expected from a country girl. She lacks manners.”

Soothingly, Yvonne said, “Mrs. Graham, don't stoop to her level. What's the brand of the anti-aging cream you mentioned? I can find it for you.”

Eileen's expression softened at the mention of the anti-aging cream. “You're always so considerate. I'll send you the picture later.”

Eileen came from a small family. Even after being married to the Graham family for over twenty years, she still couldn't fit in with the high-society ladies.

Roseanne had somehow acquired a no-brand anti-aging cream with a distinct scent of herbs. At first, Eileen dismissed it. However, after developing a pimple one day, she decided to give it a try on a whim. To her surprise, the results were remarkably good.

Eileen, always eager to build good relationships with everyone, regularly recommended the cream to the high-society ladies.

Initially, the high-society ladies turned their noses up at anything without a brand name. But when they noticed Eileen's increasingly smooth and delicate skin, with her wrinkles diminishing over time, their curiosity got the best of them. They began to seek her out, eager to uncover her secret.

This exclusive anti-aging cream was unavailable on the market, which helped Eileen build a solid reputation within her social circle. Each month, she requested about twenty boxes from Roseanne.

Eileen feared that if Roseanne didn't disclose the source of the anti-aging cream, she would be reproached by the high-society ladies.

With Yvonne's assurance, Eileen's spirits were lifted. Without further ado, she bid them farewell and headed off to join a gathering.

Brandon took Yvonne's hand, leading her upstairs.

Kayden was already in his twilight years, having spent most of his life navigating the business world. Despite his age, his prestige remained intact.

Seeing them enter the study hand in hand, he couldn't contain his anger any longer. He grabbed a cup and hurled it with all his might.

With a swift, deft motion, Brandon pulled Yvonne away just as the cup whizzed past their faces.

The cup shattered with a loud crash, sending fragments flying everywhere and nearly injuring Yvonne's foot.

Brandon's expression turned stern as he directed his anger toward Roseanne. “Roseanne, what did you tell Grandpa?”

Roseanne's lips twitched, but before she could speak, Kayden slammed his hand down on the table in fury. “You good-for-nothing! Rosie waited for you for two years. How dare you bring back some random woman and even talk about divorce?”

Random woman? Yvonne's brow furrowed, and a flicker of anger crossed her face.

Brandon immediately retorted, “Grandpa! Yvie is the eldest daughter of the Scott family. She's always been a model for the women of Yolham. You used to adore her. How could you misunderstand her just based on Roseanne's one-sided story?”Chapter 3 Seize Her Shares

Kayden trembled with rage as he leaned on his cane and stood up. “Really? You call being the other woman knowingly a misunderstanding?”

Yvonne's face hardened. “Old Mr. Graham, I wasn't aware of your grandson's marriage at first. Had I known, I, a girl of good character, would have definitely stayed away from him.” She shot a fierce look at Brandon. “You told me there was no love between you and Roseanne, and that a divorce was inevitable. That's why I agreed to your advances. Now, I'm being labeled as the other woman and ridiculed. Handle your own family issues. We're done!”

Just as Yvonne was about to leave, Brandon quickly grabbed her arm and whispered urgently, “Yvie, please don't go. My Grandpa is deceived by her, so he misunderstand you. If you leave me and Roseanne refuses to divorce, Graham Group will inevitably fall under her control, and my home will be destroyed.”

His earnest plea caused Yvonne to stop in her tracks. She turned to him and demanded, “You must resolve this matter today.”

“I will.” Brandon exhaled, then turned his gaze toward Kayden. “Grandpa, you didn't let me go abroad, so in my haste to get married, I misled you into thinking I liked Roseanne. It wasn't until I met Yvie that I understood what true love really is.”

Kayden's face remained stern, while Roseanne watched the two perform with a sarcastic gaze.

Brandon continued, “Yvie is currently the team leader at Kiefyose Medical Research Institute, and she has been invited to give lectures at several prestigious institutions. Her status is noble and she commands respect. Only someone like her is fitting to be the lady of the Graham family.”

Kiefyose Medical Research Institute, a top-tier international research institute, had stringent and tricky assessments. Even professors in the medical field couldn't necessarily pass these tests.

Surprisingly, Yvonne was the team leader.

Kayden's tone softened slightly as he said, “Since this was a misunderstanding, I apologize, Ms. Scott. However, the only woman who can be my grandson's wife is Roseanne.”

Brandon held Yvonne's hand tightly, his expression unwavering. “Grandpa, my mind is made up. If you try to stop us, Yvie and I will leave for Egrea, and we won't come back in this lifetime.”

The more one tries to prevent it, the more likely it is to backfire. If Brandon really ran off to Egrea with Yvonne, their home would be utterly ruined.

Kayden remained silent, his brows deeply furrowed.

The Graham family had few members left, and he had tragically lost his only son.

His grandson had no interest in business and was fully committed to studying medicine. His granddaughter was even worse—a total slacker. All play and no work.

They had let him down, so he had no choice but to place his hopes on his granddaughter-in-law. However, he never expected that Brandon would cheat on her.

He thought for a long time, guilt written all over his face. Turning to Roseanne, he sighed and said, “Rosie, the Graham family has wronged you. If you don't agree, I would rather die than let you two divorce.”

Brandon nervously held Yvonne's hand, fearing that Roseanne might refuse to grant the divorce.

Roseanne replied indifferently, “Since Brandon has someone he likes, there's no need for me to stay with the Graham family anymore.”

Kayden looked sorrowful. “The Sylvester family already has a daughter, so your return would be redundant. It's better for you to stay with the Graham family. I don't have many days left. After I'm gone, Graham Group will be yours.”

His grandson didn't want children, but there was still the option of in vitro fertilization. The child Roseanne would bear would still carry the Graham surname.

Graham Group would remain within the family.

Brandon's face was filled with displeasure. “Grandpa, how could Graham Group possibly be handed over to an outsider?”

Roseanne glanced at him casually and replied, “Grandpa, I managed just fine without the Sylvester family until I turned twenty, and I'll continue to do so. As for this marriage, if Brandon won't file for divorce, I will. I am not so forgiving as to tolerate his infidelity and still stay to manage the household.”

Kayden rubbed his temples, finally letting out a sigh. “You two leave. I need to have a chat with Rosie.”

Brandon had more to say, but Yvonne pulled him away.

Kayden gazed at Roseanne, his eyes filled with a mix of emotions. “Rosie, I can agree to your divorce.”

Just as Roseanne breathed a sigh of relief, Kayden continued, “But you initially invested five hundred million, so you can only take back that amount. You can't take the shares. I'll have the finance department arrange for your dividends from the past two years to be given to you as well.”

A touch of disbelief surfaced in Roseanne's eyes. “Why can I only take away five hundred million?”

Kayden explained, “Since you're divorced, you're no longer a part of the Graham family. It's inappropriate for you to hold four percent of Graham Group's shares.”

“Grandpa, I never intended to claim any part of the Graham family fortune; otherwise, I wouldn't have signed the prenuptial agreement. When Graham Group faced a financial crisis, with plummeting stock prices, I invested five hundred million and acquired four percent of the shares. I'm not just a part of your family. I'm also one of the shareholders of Graham Group.”

Roseanne's eyes grew colder as she grasped his intention. “I've poured my heart and soul into Graham Group, and now the shares have significantly appreciated, consistently trending upward. My contribution has been immense. You don't have to give me the shares, but I want 1.5 billion based on the current market valuation!”

Kayden's expression changed dramatically. He suppressed his shock and said, “That's simply out of the question. Including dividends and compensation, I'll offer you seven hundred million!”

Roseanne let out a cold, bitter laugh, her trust in Kayden completely shattered. “I see it now. The kindness you've shown me these past few years was only because I was useful, and I could bring benefits to Graham Group. I guess I misjudged you. You made me sign a prenuptial agreement. You're no better.”

Brandon was unaware of her sacrifices, and she could accept that.

But Kayden had seen everything she had done for the family. Now, he was treating her like an enemy, even trying to seize her shares.

With a steady gaze, Roseanne added, “Brandon cheated, and I can leave with nothing. I don't care about the Graham family's wealth, but what's mine is mine, and no one can take it away.”

Her mood shifted rapidly. Kayden coughed a few times, took a sip of coffee, and said in a resonant voice, “Rosie, I'm really grateful for your initial investment of five hundred million, which helped Graham Group. But I know your parents only gave you fifty million as a dowry.”

His words were diplomatic, yet Roseanne discerned their true meaning. She laughed mockingly. “It doesn't matter where the money came from; the fact is, I invested it.”

“You became a shareholder in Graham Group only after the marriage. Even before that, you signed a prenuptial agreement stating that you wouldn't take anything from the corporation. Seven hundred million is already a generous offer. I haven't even signed the share transfer document yet.”

A frosty glint appeared in Roseanne's eyes. “So, you had it all planned from the very start.”

Signing a prenuptial agreement was exactly what she wanted. After all, her assets were all over the place, and if she were to split them with Brandon, she would surely be at a loss.

She didn't care about this small share, but giving it to the Graham family for free was out of the question.

It was a bit of a hassle, but if she handed it over to the lawyer, she wouldn't have to spend much time on it.

Kayden stroked his beard, his deep-set eyes gleaming with wisdom. “One must know their place in life. Stirring up a big fuss won't do you any good. The Sylvester family won't help you, and opposing the Graham family is like throwing straws against the wind.”

When gentleness didn't work, he resorted to a more forceful approach.

A smirk played on Roseanne's lips. “If you're so eager to take my money, I'll just file a lawsuit.”

Continuing this conversation wouldn't lead to any resolution, and staying here was merely a waste of time.

Kayden scoffed. “I'd like to see which lawyer would dare to represent you and go against the Graham family.”

“Old Mr. Graham, you won't be around for much longer, so there's no need for you to worry.”

With that, Roseanne turned and walked away.

Kayden's face turned pale. Suddenly struggling to breathe, he shattered the cup in his hand.

Upon hearing the commotion, the butler hastily pushed open the door, only to be met with Roseanne's cold visage. Instinctively, he greeted her, “Mrs. Graham.”

“The Graham family is ruthless and greedy. I'm afraid I can't bear that title.”

Her tone was light and airy, carrying a hint of mockery.

The butler paused for a moment. After Roseanne left, he hastily rushed into the study.

Inside the car, Brandon furrowed his brows. “I really can't understand why Grandpa places such high importance on Roseanne, even considering giving her Graham Group.”

Yvonne had already done her on Roseanne. She said softly, “From what I know, Roseanne didn't make it to university. She barely scraped through middle school, skipping classes and getting into fights, bullying her peers. She simply doesn't have the capability to be a vice president.”

Brandon was taken aback. It was his first time hearing about Roseanne's affairs in the countryside, and he never imagined her to be a troublemaker.

Yvonne continued, “I knew about the crisis at Graham Group two years ago. When your grandfather fell ill, three directors took advantage of the situation, embezzled company funds, and fled abroad. Eventually, the police brought them back, and the credit should go to them. Somehow, rumors started circulating that Roseanne deserved the praise. People also said she secured several collaborations, stabilizing Graham Group. As for the five hundred million... The Sylvester family clearly doesn't care about Roseanne. Otherwise, they wouldn't have married her off as soon as they found her. There's no way they would have given a dowry of five hundred million; at most, a few tens of million. I suspect she's done something illegal. If it ever comes to light, it could potentially implicate Graham Group.",1,1747382619.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

1knvdy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1knvdy2/the_divorced_heiresss_hidden_identities_novel/,The Divorced Heiress's Hidden Identities Novel- Roseanne Sylvester devoted herself wholeheartedly to her husband's family,"Chapter 1 A Life Of Luxury

“Roseanne, let's get a divorce!”

Standing before Roseanne Sylvester was Brandon Graham, her husband of two years from a whirlwind marriage.

He was clad in a sleek black trench coat, his handsome face void of any unnecessary expressions. His gaze toward her held a hint of apology. “I'm now with Yvonne.”

Roseanne stood dumbfounded at the door, her large pajamas draped over her body, highlighting her slender figure. It took her a couple of seconds to comprehend his words. “She doesn't know you're married?”

Two years ago, Egrea had experienced a sudden outbreak of a highly contagious disease, which had caused countless deaths and injuries.

At that time, Brandon had just graduated from his postgraduate studies and joined a top-notch hospital in the country. Upon learning about the situation, he resolutely decided to go abroad as a volunteer to provide support.

Back then, they had just gotten their marriage certificate.

Two years had passed and the first thing he did upon returning to his homeland was, astonishingly, to propose a divorce. Even more shocking was that his affair was with the darling daughter of the Scott family.

Brandon explained, “Our marriage registration was rushed. She was among the first volunteers, and she didn't know.”

Sarcasm played at the corners of Roseanne's lips. “So, you concealed the fact that you were already married when you pursued her?”

“I didn't,” Brandon hurriedly denied, a hint of regret flickering in his eyes. “The epidemic was fraught with danger. Yvonne repeatedly risked her life to save me. As we fought the disease together, time made our hearts grow fonder of each other. Roseanne, our marriage was rushed and there's no love between us. If it weren't for your father saving my grandfather, this union wouldn't have taken place. Yvie and I, on the other hand, share a deep understanding and mutual affection. Our love is genuine.”

Roseanne scoffed. She could barely suppress the smirk tugging at the corner of her lips. “It was you who made the promise to me. Don't make it sound as if I forced you into getting married.”

Having missed out on twenty years of familial affection, she felt like an outsider in the Sylvester family. Brandon's promise was like a warm embrace in the coldest winter, offering her a status that allowed her to remain.

Driven by a sense of gratitude, when Graham Group was in a financial crisis, she stepped in to take charge. She invested in the business, taught herself business studies, economics, and management, and worked tirelessly day and night to help the company weather the storm.

When Brandon's grandpa ,Kayden Graham, fell ill, she was constantly on the move, tirelessly seeking renowned doctors to treat him.

Her mother-in-law and sister-in-law had a fondness for jewelry, handbags, and formal dresses. Whenever they expressed a desire for something, she would purchase it without hesitation.

She was in charge of overseeing all the expenses for the Graham family, both for the business and the household.

She had given so much, only to be told that there was no love between them.

Brandon's face flushed red. “I'm sorry. Grandpa thinks highly of you, and I believed you would make an ideal wife. I followed his plans, made promises to you, and asked you to wait for me. If I hadn't met Yvonne, I would have been content to be a respectful and courteous husband to you.”

The conversation had reached its conclusion, and there was no reason for Roseanne to remain. “Fine, I consent to the divorce.”

While taken aback, Brandon also breathed a sigh of relief. He hadn't expected her to agree so readily.

After some thought, he asked, “After the divorce, will you still stay with Graham Group?”

“We'll be divorced then. Why should I stay?”

“Yvie contributed significantly to the development of a provirus inhibitor. She's successfully joined Kiefyose Medical Research Institute. I'm still in my observation period, so I'll be returning to Egrea.”

Roseanne was astonished. “A provirus inhibitor? Yvonne was involved in its development?”

Why didn't that bunch of old folks tell me?

When the topic of joining Kiefyose Medical Research Institute came up, pride filled Brandon's eyes. “Yvie is a genius in the medical field and can be considered an expert in drug research. The corporate world prioritizes self-interest, full of deception and internal strife. She's too innocent and not suited to join Graham Group. You, on the other hand, are perfectly suited for this line of work, thriving in the professional world like a fish in water. This is why Grandpa values you so much, and he might not agree to our divorce.”

Brandon's words conveyed his deep dissatisfaction with the workplace culture.

He reveled in the blissful life that wealth had afforded him, standing at the pinnacle of society. Yet, he looked down upon those who contributed to his family's fortune.

A smirk of mockery crossed Roseanne's face.

She couldn't believe she had actually once thought him to be dependable.

Brandon didn't notice the change in Roseanne's expression as he continued, “As long as you stay with Graham Group, Grandpa won't make things difficult for us. If you choose to stay, I'll give you a one percent share, which would allow you to receive dividends of several million every month.”

At this point, Roseanne couldn't help but laugh. “One percent? Do you think I care about that? You want me to divorce and make room for her, yet still expect me to clean up the mess in Graham Group and earn money for you. Where on earth would you find such a sweet deal?”

Brandon thought his offered compensation was already generous. However, Roseanne's deliberate disparagement of his company felt to him like creating unnecessary turmoil.

His face flushed with a hint of anger. “What do you mean by 'mess'? Graham Group can thrive just fine without you. Kiefyose Medical Research Institute is a world-renowned establishment. Yvie and I chose to contribute to our nation by working here. You're living a life of luxury. What more could you possibly be dissatisfied with?”

Chapter 2 Sooner Rather Than Later

Roseanne looked at him coldly. “I won't stay with Graham Group, nor do I want your shares. I own a four percent share in Graham Group, which is currently valued at about one point five billion. I'll only take what's rightfully mine.”

Brandon was stunned. “Four percent? How did you manage to own so many shares in Graham Group?”

“Two years ago, when Graham Group was facing a financial crisis, I invested five hundred million.”

Brandon frowned, utterly unconvinced. “Five hundred million for a four percent share? Since when did the Graham Group shares become so cheap?”

Brandon was aware of the crisis in Graham Group and her involvement in the company. However, nobody informed him about Roseanne's five-hundred-million investment.

Acquiring four percent of shares for five hundred million was practically a giveaway.

Thinking that she must have infiltrated the corporation and deliberately bought at a low price, he couldn't help but feel irritated.

Roseanne found it ironic and didn't want to say anything more.

Just as Brandon was about to speak again, she abruptly shut the door on him.

His expression was terribly grim as he headed to Yvonne Scott's condominium overnight.

Upon hearing Brandon's relay of Roseanne's words, Yvonne furrowed her brows. “Graham Group is enormous. A minor crisis two years ago wouldn't have shaken it to its core. The shares couldn't have possibly dropped that much. How could an investment of five hundred million secure her four percent of the shares? Most importantly, where did she get five hundred million from? I thought she was a woman of clear intentions, someone who dared to love and hate. Seems like I misjudged her. I didn't expect her to be so greedy.”

Yvonne possessed a strikingly intense appearance, marked by deeply set features. Her cold, piercing eyes gave the impression that she had everything under control, as though nothing could evade her scrutiny.

Brandon's eyes revealed his irritation. Two years ago, Roseanne had a gentle and dignified presence that seemed to complement him perfectly. However, in just two years, her luxurious lifestyle had altered her tastes. She even demanded an astounding sum of one point five billion.

“Forget about one point five billion. She'll never even get five hundred million.” Yvonne cocked an eyebrow. “She was raised in the countryside and has lived a life of luxury for two years. It's normal for her to be a bit greedy. You two don't share any emotional bond, so if she agrees to divorce without making a fuss, I can give her ten million.”

Brandon's heart softened. He pulled her into his embrace and said, “Yvie, you are truly kind-hearted. Meeting you has been my greatest fortune.”

Yvonne let out a soft humph. “She lacks education and skills. As a fellow woman, I won't make things difficult for her.”

Their eyes locked briefly before Yvonne looked away. Intrigued, Brandon scooped her up and headed toward the bed. “Yvie, it's been a while since we've been intimate.”

Without any hesitation, Yvonne shed her clothes and offered a passionate kiss.

Roseanne owned a house in the city. After deciding to divorce, she quickly packed her things and left.

She took a bath and lay in bed. The thought of not having to wake up early for Graham Group the next morning brought her immense relief and comfort.

She thought it wasn't so bad that the marriage ended.

At that moment, a new message popped up. Roseanne tapped on it. It was a message from Arthur Xanthos.

It read: Roseanne, I've reviewed the proposal. It's quite impressive. I agree to collaborate with Graham Group.

Roseanne lightly tapped the screen, typing: Old Mr. Xanthos, I'm leaving Graham Group. Please consider whether or not you wish to continue our collaboration. I can't guarantee the smooth progress of the project after my departure.

There were plenty of scoundrels in Graham Group, yet Kayden trusted them and wouldn't allow any action against them. All she could do was forcefully suppress their restless hearts.

In her absence, those lying in wait would undoubtedly lose their patience.

On the other end of the phone, an elderly man with snow-white hair rose from the couch. His once-cloudy eyes began to clear, and a smile slowly crept onto his lips.

Seeing that, the butler rushed over in a state of panic. “Old Mr. Xanthos, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?”

With a firm grip on the butler's hand and eyes gleaming, Arthur excitedly exclaimed, “Quick, find out if Roseanne is considering a divorce!”

The fact that Brandon had returned to the country was not a secret. He had known about it not too long ago.

Something major must have occurred for Roseanne to consider leaving Graham Group.

“Old Mr. Xanthos, Brandon just returned to the country. It's unlikely he could have divorced Ms. Roseanne, right?”

Arthur waved his hand dismissively. “What do you know? I've met that young man from the Graham family. He's a fool. Once Roseanne gets divorced, Calvin will have his chance. There's no time to waste. Go and find out more.”

The next day, at the crack of dawn, Roseanne received a call from Kayden and drove to the Graham residence.

She encountered Brandon and Yvonne at the main entrance.

They walked hand in hand and looked just like a newlywed couple, deeply in love and inseparable.

Their eyes met, and it was as if sparks were flashing in the air.

With a beaming smile, Eileen Ziegler emerged, cheerfully taking Yvonne's hand into hers. She gently patted it and said affectionately, “Yvie, you're here. I've missed you dearly.”

“Hello, Mrs. Graham.”

Eileen praised Yvonne before turning her attention to Roseanne. “Rosie, you've made substantial money working for Graham Group these past two years. Think of it as compensation from us. It would be best for everyone if you got your divorce papers sooner rather than later.”

Ever since Roseanne became part of the Graham family, Eileen had never made things difficult for her. It wasn't that she didn't want to, but rather, she didn't dare to.

She had thought that the girl who grew up in the countryside would be gentle and obedient, easy to handle.

Yet, as soon as Roseanne joined the family, she held the reins of power and even became the vice president of Graham Group. Eileen, despite her myriad thoughts and concerns, had to suppress them all and, ironically, ended up trying to please Roseanne instead.

To say she wasn't frustrated would be a lie. Every day, she yearned to regain the authority she once had as a mother-in-law.

Now that her son had returned to the country and was planning to divorce Roseanne, she was wholeheartedly in favor.

Eileen lifted her chin as she commanded, “You won't need to buy the anti-aging cream for me anymore. Just give me their contact information.”

A sarcastic smile curled at the corners of Roseanne's lips as she ignored Eileen. She strode through the door and headed straight for Kayden's study.

Eileen's pride was wounded, and her expression darkened instantly. “Just as expected from a country girl. She lacks manners.”

Soothingly, Yvonne said, “Mrs. Graham, don't stoop to her level. What's the brand of the anti-aging cream you mentioned? I can find it for you.”

Eileen's expression softened at the mention of the anti-aging cream. “You're always so considerate. I'll send you the picture later.”

Eileen came from a small family. Even after being married to the Graham family for over twenty years, she still couldn't fit in with the high-society ladies.

Roseanne had somehow acquired a no-brand anti-aging cream with a distinct scent of herbs. At first, Eileen dismissed it. However, after developing a pimple one day, she decided to give it a try on a whim. To her surprise, the results were remarkably good.

Eileen, always eager to build good relationships with everyone, regularly recommended the cream to the high-society ladies.

Initially, the high-society ladies turned their noses up at anything without a brand name. But when they noticed Eileen's increasingly smooth and delicate skin, with her wrinkles diminishing over time, their curiosity got the best of them. They began to seek her out, eager to uncover her secret.

Eileen feared that if Roseanne didn't disclose the source of the anti-aging cream, she would be reproached by the high-society ladies.

With Yvonne's assurance, Eileen's spirits were lifted. Without further ado, she bid them farewell and headed off to join a gathering.

Brandon took Yvonne's hand, leading her upstairs.

Kayden was already in his twilight years, having spent most of his life navigating the business world. Despite his age, his prestige remained intact.

Seeing them enter the study hand in hand, he couldn't contain his anger any longer. He grabbed a cup and hurled it with all his might.

With a swift, deft motion, Brandon pulled Yvonne away just as the cup whizzed past their faces.

The cup shattered with a loud crash, sending fragments flying everywhere and nearly injuring Yvonne's foot.

Brandon's expression turned stern as he directed his anger toward Roseanne. “Roseanne, what did you tell Grandpa?”

Roseanne's lips twitched, but before she could speak, Kayden slammed his hand down on the table in fury. “You good-for-nothing! Rosie waited for you for two years. How dare you bring back some random woman and even talk about divorce?”

Random woman? Yvonne's brow furrowed, and a flicker of anger crossed her face.

Brandon immediately retorted, “Grandpa! Yvie is the eldest daughter of the Scott family. She's always been a model for the women of Yolham. You used to adore her. How could you misunderstand her just based on Roseanne's one-sided story?”Chapter 3 Seize Her Shares

Kayden trembled with rage as he leaned on his cane and stood up. “Really? You call being the other woman knowingly a misunderstanding?”

Yvonne's face hardened. “Old Mr. Graham, I wasn't aware of your grandson's marriage at first. Had I known, I, a girl of good character, would have definitely stayed away from him.” She shot a fierce look at Brandon. “You told me there was no love between you and Roseanne, and that a divorce was inevitable. That's why I agreed to your advances. Now, I'm being labeled as the other woman and ridiculed. Handle your own family issues. We're done!”

Just as Yvonne was about to leave, Brandon quickly grabbed her arm and whispered urgently, “Yvie, please don't go. My Grandpa is deceived by her, so he misunderstand you. If you leave me and Roseanne refuses to divorce, Graham Group will inevitably fall under her control, and my home will be destroyed.”

His earnest plea caused Yvonne to stop in her tracks. She turned to him and demanded, “You must resolve this matter today.”

“I will.” Brandon exhaled, then turned his gaze toward Kayden. “Grandpa, you didn't let me go abroad, so in my haste to get married, I misled you into thinking I liked Roseanne. It wasn't until I met Yvie that I understood what true love really is.”

Kayden's face remained stern, while Roseanne watched the two perform with a sarcastic gaze.

Brandon continued, “Yvie is currently the team leader at Kiefyose Medical Research Institute, and she has been invited to give lectures at several prestigious institutions. Her status is noble and she commands respect. Only someone like her is fitting to be the lady of the Graham family.”

Kiefyose Medical Research Institute, a top-tier international research institute, had stringent and tricky assessments. Even professors in the medical field couldn't necessarily pass these tests.

Surprisingly, Yvonne was the team leader.

Kayden's tone softened slightly as he said, “Since this was a misunderstanding, I apologize, Ms. Scott. However, the only woman who can be my grandson's wife is Roseanne.”

Brandon held Yvonne's hand tightly, his expression unwavering. “Grandpa, my mind is made up. If you try to stop us, Yvie and I will leave for Egrea, and we won't come back in this lifetime.”

The more one tries to prevent it, the more likely it is to backfire. If Brandon really ran off to Egrea with Yvonne, their home would be utterly ruined.

Kayden remained silent, his brows deeply furrowed.

The Graham family had few members left, and he had tragically lost his only son.

His grandson had no interest in business and was fully committed to studying medicine. His granddaughter was even worse—a total slacker. All play and no work.

They had let him down, so he had no choice but to place his hopes on his granddaughter-in-law. However, he never expected that Brandon would cheat on her.

He thought for a long time, guilt written all over his face. Turning to Roseanne, he sighed and said, “Rosie, the Graham family has wronged you. If you don't agree, I would rather die than let you two divorce.”

Brandon nervously held Yvonne's hand, fearing that Roseanne might refuse to grant the divorce.

Roseanne replied indifferently, “Since Brandon has someone he likes, there's no need for me to stay with the Graham family anymore.”

Kayden looked sorrowful. “The Sylvester family already has a daughter, so your return would be redundant. It's better for you to stay with the Graham family. I don't have many days left. After I'm gone, Graham Group will be yours.”

His grandson didn't want children, but there was still the option of in vitro fertilization. The child Roseanne would bear would still carry the Graham surname.

Graham Group would remain within the family.

Brandon's face was filled with displeasure. “Grandpa, how could Graham Group possibly be handed over to an outsider?”

Roseanne glanced at him casually and replied, “Grandpa, I managed just fine without the Sylvester family until I turned twenty, and I'll continue to do so. As for this marriage, if Brandon won't file for divorce, I will. I am not so forgiving as to tolerate his infidelity and still stay to manage the household.”

Kayden rubbed his temples, finally letting out a sigh. “You two leave. I need to have a chat with Rosie.”

Brandon had more to say, but Yvonne pulled him away.

Kayden gazed at Roseanne, his eyes filled with a mix of emotions. “Rosie, I can agree to your divorce.”

Just as Roseanne breathed a sigh of relief, Kayden continued, “But you initially invested five hundred million, so you can only take back that amount. You can't take the shares. I'll have the finance department arrange for your dividends from the past two years to be given to you as well.”

A touch of disbelief surfaced in Roseanne's eyes. “Why can I only take away five hundred million?”

Kayden explained, “Since you're divorced, you're no longer a part of the Graham family. It's inappropriate for you to hold four percent of Graham Group's shares.”

“Grandpa, I never intended to claim any part of the Graham family fortune; otherwise, I wouldn't have signed the prenuptial agreement. When Graham Group faced a financial crisis, with plummeting stock prices, I invested five hundred million and acquired four percent of the shares. I'm not just a part of your family. I'm also one of the shareholders of Graham Group.”

Roseanne's eyes grew colder as she grasped his intention. “I've poured my heart and soul into Graham Group, and now the shares have significantly appreciated, consistently trending upward. My contribution has been immense. You don't have to give me the shares, but I want 1.5 billion based on the current market valuation!”

Kayden's expression changed dramatically. He suppressed his shock and said, “That's simply out of the question. Including dividends and compensation, I'll offer you seven hundred million!”

Roseanne let out a cold, bitter laugh, her trust in Kayden completely shattered. “I see it now. The kindness you've shown me these past few years was only because I was useful, and I could bring benefits to Graham Group. I guess I misjudged you. You made me sign a prenuptial agreement. You're no better.”

Brandon was unaware of her sacrifices, and she could accept that.

But Kayden had seen everything she had done for the family. Now, he was treating her like an enemy, even trying to seize her shares.

With a steady gaze, Roseanne added, “Brandon cheated, and I can leave with nothing. I don't care about the Graham family's wealth, but what's mine is mine, and no one can take it away.”

Her mood shifted rapidly. Kayden coughed a few times, took a sip of coffee, and said in a resonant voice, “Rosie, I'm really grateful for your initial investment of five hundred million, which helped Graham Group. But I know your parents only gave you fifty million as a dowry.”

His words were diplomatic, yet Roseanne discerned their true meaning. She laughed mockingly. “It doesn't matter where the money came from; the fact is, I invested it.”

“You became a shareholder in Graham Group only after the marriage. Even before that, you signed a prenuptial agreement stating that you wouldn't take anything from the corporation. Seven hundred million is already a generous offer. I haven't even signed the share transfer document yet.”

A frosty glint appeared in Roseanne's eyes. “So, you had it all planned from the very start.”

Signing a prenuptial agreement was exactly what she wanted. After all, her assets were all over the place, and if she were to split them with Brandon, she would surely be at a loss.

She didn't care about this small share, but giving it to the Graham family for free was out of the question.

It was a bit of a hassle, but if she handed it over to the lawyer, she wouldn't have to spend much time on it.

Kayden stroked his beard, his deep-set eyes gleaming with wisdom. “One must know their place in life. Stirring up a big fuss won't do you any good. The Sylvester family won't help you, and opposing the Graham family is like throwing straws against the wind.”

When gentleness didn't work, he resorted to a more forceful approach.

A smirk played on Roseanne's lips. “If you're so eager to take my money, I'll just file a lawsuit.”

Continuing this conversation wouldn't lead to any resolution, and staying here was merely a waste of time.

Kayden scoffed. “I'd like to see which lawyer would dare to represent you and go against the Graham family.”

“Old Mr. Graham, you won't be around for much longer, so there's no need for you to worry.”

With that, Roseanne turned and walked away.

Kayden's face turned pale. Suddenly struggling to breathe, he shattered the cup in his hand.

Upon hearing the commotion, the butler hastily pushed open the door, only to be met with Roseanne's cold visage. Instinctively, he greeted her, “Mrs. Graham.”

“The Graham family is ruthless and greedy. I'm afraid I can't bear that title.”

Her tone was light and airy, carrying a hint of mockery.

The butler paused for a moment. After Roseanne left, he hastily rushed into the study.

Inside the car, Brandon furrowed his brows. “I really can't understand why Grandpa places such high importance on Roseanne, even considering giving her Graham Group.”

Yvonne had already done her on Roseanne. She said softly, “From what I know, Roseanne didn't make it to university. She barely scraped through middle school, skipping classes and getting into fights, bullying her peers. She simply doesn't have the capability to be a vice president.”

Brandon was taken aback. It was his first time hearing about Roseanne's affairs in the countryside, and he never imagined her to be a troublemaker.

Yvonne continued, “I knew about the crisis at Graham Group two years ago. When your grandfather fell ill, three directors took advantage of the situation, embezzled company funds, and fled abroad. Eventually, the police brought them back, and the credit should go to them. Somehow, rumors started circulating that Roseanne deserved the praise. People also said she secured several collaborations, stabilizing Graham Group. As for the five hundred million... The Sylvester family clearly doesn't care about Roseanne. Otherwise, they wouldn't have married her off as soon as they found her. There's no way they would have given a dowry of five hundred million; at most, a few tens of million. I suspect she's done something illegal. If it ever comes to light, it could potentially implicate Graham Group.",1,1747382315.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

“Roseanne, let's get a divorce!”

Standing before Roseanne Sylvester was Brandon Graham, her husband of two years from a whirlwind marriage.

He was clad in a sleek black trench coat, his handsome face void of any unnecessary expressions. His gaze toward her held a hint of apology. “I'm now with Yvonne.”

Roseanne stood dumbfounded at the door, her large pajamas draped over her body, highlighting her slender figure. It took her a couple of seconds to comprehend his words. “She doesn't know you're married?”

Two years ago, Egrea had experienced a sudden outbreak of a highly contagious disease, which had caused countless deaths and injuries.

At that time, Brandon had just graduated from his postgraduate studies and joined a top-notch hospital in the country. Upon learning about the situation, he resolutely decided to go abroad as a volunteer to provide support.

Back then, they had just gotten their marriage certificate.

Two years had passed and the first thing he did upon returning to his homeland was, astonishingly, to propose a divorce. Even more shocking was that his affair was with the darling daughter of the Scott family.

Brandon explained, “Our marriage registration was rushed. She was among the first volunteers, and she didn't know.”

Sarcasm played at the corners of Roseanne's lips. “So, you concealed the fact that you were already married when you pursued her?”

“I didn't,” Brandon hurriedly denied, a hint of regret flickering in his eyes. “The epidemic was fraught with danger. Yvonne repeatedly risked her life to save me. As we fought the disease together, time made our hearts grow fonder of each other. Roseanne, our marriage was rushed and there's no love between us. If it weren't for your father saving my grandfather, this union wouldn't have taken place. Yvie and I, on the other hand, share a deep understanding and mutual affection. Our love is genuine.”

Roseanne scoffed. She could barely suppress the smirk tugging at the corner of her lips. “It was you who made the promise to me. Don't make it sound as if I forced you into getting married.”

Having missed out on twenty years of familial affection, she felt like an outsider in the Sylvester family. Brandon's promise was like a warm embrace in the coldest winter, offering her a status that allowed her to remain.

Driven by a sense of gratitude, when Graham Group was in a financial crisis, she stepped in to take charge. She invested in the business, taught herself business studies, economics, and management, and worked tirelessly day and night to help the company weather the storm.

When Brandon's grandpa ,Kayden Graham, fell ill, she was constantly on the move, tirelessly seeking renowned doctors to treat him.

Her mother-in-law and sister-in-law had a fondness for jewelry, handbags, and formal dresses. Whenever they expressed a desire for something, she would purchase it without hesitation.

She was in charge of overseeing all the expenses for the Graham family, both for the business and the household.

She had given so much, only to be told that there was no love between them.

Brandon's face flushed red. “I'm sorry. Grandpa thinks highly of you, and I believed you would make an ideal wife. I followed his plans, made promises to you, and asked you to wait for me. If I hadn't met Yvonne, I would have been content to be a respectful and courteous husband to you.”

The conversation had reached its conclusion, and there was no reason for Roseanne to remain. “Fine, I consent to the divorce.”

While taken aback, Brandon also breathed a sigh of relief. He hadn't expected her to agree so readily.

After some thought, he asked, “After the divorce, will you still stay with Graham Group?”

“We'll be divorced then. Why should I stay?”

“Yvie contributed significantly to the development of a provirus inhibitor. She's successfully joined Kiefyose Medical Research Institute. I'm still in my observation period, so I'll be returning to Egrea.”

Roseanne was astonished. “A provirus inhibitor? Yvonne was involved in its development?”

Why didn't that bunch of old folks tell me?

When the topic of joining Kiefyose Medical Research Institute came up, pride filled Brandon's eyes. “Yvie is a genius in the medical field and can be considered an expert in drug research. The corporate world prioritizes self-interest, full of deception and internal strife. She's too innocent and not suited to join Graham Group. You, on the other hand, are perfectly suited for this line of work, thriving in the professional world like a fish in water. This is why Grandpa values you so much, and he might not agree to our divorce.”

Brandon's words conveyed his deep dissatisfaction with the workplace culture.

He reveled in the blissful life that wealth had afforded him, standing at the pinnacle of society. Yet, he looked down upon those who contributed to his family's fortune.

A smirk of mockery crossed Roseanne's face.

She couldn't believe she had actually once thought him to be dependable.

Brandon didn't notice the change in Roseanne's expression as he continued, “As long as you stay with Graham Group, Grandpa won't make things difficult for us. If you choose to stay, I'll give you a one percent share, which would allow you to receive dividends of several million every month.”

At this point, Roseanne couldn't help but laugh. “One percent? Do you think I care about that? You want me to divorce and make room for her, yet still expect me to clean up the mess in Graham Group and earn money for you. Where on earth would you find such a sweet deal?”

Brandon thought his offered compensation was already generous. However, Roseanne's deliberate disparagement of his company felt to him like creating unnecessary turmoil.

His face flushed with a hint of anger. “What do you mean by 'mess'? Graham Group can thrive just fine without you. Kiefyose Medical Research Institute is a world-renowned establishment. Yvie and I chose to contribute to our nation by working here. You're living a life of luxury. What more could you possibly be dissatisfied with?”

Chapter 2 Sooner Rather Than Later

Roseanne looked at him coldly. “I won't stay with Graham Group, nor do I want your shares. I own a four percent share in Graham Group, which is currently valued at about one point five billion. I'll only take what's rightfully mine.”

Brandon was stunned. “Four percent? How did you manage to own so many shares in Graham Group?”

“Two years ago, when Graham Group was facing a financial crisis, I invested five hundred million.”

Brandon frowned, utterly unconvinced. “Five hundred million for a four percent share? Since when did the Graham Group shares become so cheap?”

Brandon was aware of the crisis in Graham Group and her involvement in the company. However, nobody informed him about Roseanne's five-hundred-million investment.

Acquiring four percent of shares for five hundred million was practically a giveaway.

Thinking that she must have infiltrated the corporation and deliberately bought at a low price, he couldn't help but feel irritated.

Roseanne found it ironic and didn't want to say anything more.

Just as Brandon was about to speak again, she abruptly shut the door on him.

His expression was terribly grim as he headed to Yvonne Scott's condominium overnight.

Upon hearing Brandon's relay of Roseanne's words, Yvonne furrowed her brows. “Graham Group is enormous. A minor crisis two years ago wouldn't have shaken it to its core. The shares couldn't have possibly dropped that much. How could an investment of five hundred million secure her four percent of the shares? Most importantly, where did she get five hundred million from? I thought she was a woman of clear intentions, someone who dared to love and hate. Seems like I misjudged her. I didn't expect her to be so greedy.”

Yvonne possessed a strikingly intense appearance, marked by deeply set features. Her cold, piercing eyes gave the impression that she had everything under control, as though nothing could evade her scrutiny.

Brandon's eyes revealed his irritation. Two years ago, Roseanne had a gentle and dignified presence that seemed to complement him perfectly. However, in just two years, her luxurious lifestyle had altered her tastes. She even demanded an astounding sum of one point five billion.

“Forget about one point five billion. She'll never even get five hundred million.” Yvonne cocked an eyebrow. “She was raised in the countryside and has lived a life of luxury for two years. It's normal for her to be a bit greedy. You two don't share any emotional bond, so if she agrees to divorce without making a fuss, I can give her ten million.”

Brandon's heart softened. He pulled her into his embrace and said, “Yvie, you are truly kind-hearted. Meeting you has been my greatest fortune.”

Yvonne let out a soft humph. “She lacks education and skills. As a fellow woman, I won't make things difficult for her.”

Their eyes locked briefly before Yvonne looked away. Intrigued, Brandon scooped her up and headed toward the bed. “Yvie, it's been a while since we've been intimate.”

Without any hesitation, Yvonne shed her clothes and offered a passionate kiss.

Roseanne owned a house in the city. After deciding to divorce, she quickly packed her things and left.

She took a bath and lay in bed. The thought of not having to wake up early for Graham Group the next morning brought her immense relief and comfort.

She thought it wasn't so bad that the marriage ended.

At that moment, a new message popped up. Roseanne tapped on it. It was a message from Arthur Xanthos.

It read: Roseanne, I've reviewed the proposal. It's quite impressive. I agree to collaborate with Graham Group.

Roseanne lightly tapped the screen, typing: Old Mr. Xanthos, I'm leaving Graham Group. Please consider whether or not you wish to continue our collaboration. I can't guarantee the smooth progress of the project after my departure.

There were plenty of scoundrels in Graham Group, yet Kayden trusted them and wouldn't allow any action against them. All she could do was forcefully suppress their restless hearts.

In her absence, those lying in wait would undoubtedly lose their patience.

On the other end of the phone, an elderly man with snow-white hair rose from the couch. His once-cloudy eyes began to clear, and a smile slowly crept onto his lips.

Seeing that, the butler rushed over in a state of panic. “Old Mr. Xanthos, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?”

With a firm grip on the butler's hand and eyes gleaming, Arthur excitedly exclaimed, “Quick, find out if Roseanne is considering a divorce!”

The fact that Brandon had returned to the country was not a secret. He had known about it not too long ago.

Something major must have occurred for Roseanne to consider leaving Graham Group.

“Old Mr. Xanthos, Brandon just returned to the country. It's unlikely he could have divorced Ms. Roseanne, right?”

Arthur waved his hand dismissively. “What do you know? I've met that young man from the Graham family. He's a fool. Once Roseanne gets divorced, Calvin will have his chance. There's no time to waste. Go and find out more.”

The next day, at the crack of dawn, Roseanne received a call from Kayden and drove to the Graham residence.

She encountered Brandon and Yvonne at the main entrance.

They walked hand in hand and looked just like a newlywed couple, deeply in love and inseparable.

Their eyes met, and it was as if sparks were flashing in the air.

With a beaming smile, Eileen Ziegler emerged, cheerfully taking Yvonne's hand into hers. She gently patted it and said affectionately, “Yvie, you're here. I've missed you dearly.”

“Hello, Mrs. Graham.”

Eileen praised Yvonne before turning her attention to Roseanne. “Rosie, you've made substantial money working for Graham Group these past two years. Think of it as compensation from us. It would be best for everyone if you got your divorce papers sooner rather than later.”

Ever since Roseanne became part of the Graham family, Eileen had never made things difficult for her. It wasn't that she didn't want to, but rather, she didn't dare to.

She had thought that the girl who grew up in the countryside would be gentle and obedient, easy to handle.

Yet, as soon as Roseanne joined the family, she held the reins of power and even became the vice president of Graham Group. Eileen, despite her myriad thoughts and concerns, had to suppress them all and, ironically, ended up trying to please Roseanne instead.

To say she wasn't frustrated would be a lie. Every day, she yearned to regain the authority she once had as a mother-in-law.

Now that her son had returned to the country and was planning to divorce Roseanne, she was wholeheartedly in favor.

Eileen lifted her chin as she commanded, “You won't need to buy the anti-aging cream for me anymore. Just give me their contact information.”

A sarcastic smile curled at the corners of Roseanne's lips as she ignored Eileen. She strode through the door and headed straight for Kayden's study.

Eileen's pride was wounded, and her expression darkened instantly. “Just as expected from a country girl. She lacks manners.”

Soothingly, Yvonne said, “Mrs. Graham, don't stoop to her level. What's the brand of the anti-aging cream you mentioned? I can find it for you.”

Eileen's expression softened at the mention of the anti-aging cream. “You're always so considerate. I'll send you the picture later.”

Eileen came from a small family. Even after being married to the Graham family for over twenty years, she still couldn't fit in with the high-society ladies.

Roseanne had somehow acquired a no-brand anti-aging cream with a distinct scent of herbs. At first, Eileen dismissed it. However, after developing a pimple one day, she decided to give it a try on a whim. To her surprise, the results were remarkably good.

Eileen, always eager to build good relationships with everyone, regularly recommended the cream to the high-society ladies.

Initially, the high-society ladies turned their noses up at anything without a brand name. But when they noticed Eileen's increasingly smooth and delicate skin, with her wrinkles diminishing over time, their curiosity got the best of them. They began to seek her out, eager to uncover her secret.

This exclusive anti-aging cream was unavailable on the market, which helped Eileen build a solid reputation within her social circle. Each month, she requested about twenty boxes from Roseanne.

Eileen feared that if Roseanne didn't disclose the source of the anti-aging cream, she would be reproached by the high-society ladies.

With Yvonne's assurance, Eileen's spirits were lifted. Without further ado, she bid them farewell and headed off to join a gathering.

Brandon took Yvonne's hand, leading her upstairs.

Kayden was already in his twilight years, having spent most of his life navigating the business world. Despite his age, his prestige remained intact.

Seeing them enter the study hand in hand, he couldn't contain his anger any longer. He grabbed a cup and hurled it with all his might.

With a swift, deft motion, Brandon pulled Yvonne away just as the cup whizzed past their faces.

The cup shattered with a loud crash, sending fragments flying everywhere and nearly injuring Yvonne's foot.

Brandon's expression turned stern as he directed his anger toward Roseanne. “Roseanne, what did you tell Grandpa?”

Roseanne's lips twitched, but before she could speak, Kayden slammed his hand down on the table in fury. “You good-for-nothing! Rosie waited for you for two years. How dare you bring back some random woman and even talk about divorce?”

Random woman? Yvonne's brow furrowed, and a flicker of anger crossed her face.

Brandon immediately retorted, “Grandpa! Yvie is the eldest daughter of the Scott family. She's always been a model for the women of Yolham. You used to adore her. How could you misunderstand her just based on Roseanne's one-sided story?”Chapter 3 Seize Her Shares

Kayden trembled with rage as he leaned on his cane and stood up. “Really? You call being the other woman knowingly a misunderstanding?”

Yvonne's face hardened. “Old Mr. Graham, I wasn't aware of your grandson's marriage at first. Had I known, I, a girl of good character, would have definitely stayed away from him.” She shot a fierce look at Brandon. “You told me there was no love between you and Roseanne, and that a divorce was inevitable. That's why I agreed to your advances. Now, I'm being labeled as the other woman and ridiculed. Handle your own family issues. We're done!”

Just as Yvonne was about to leave, Brandon quickly grabbed her arm and whispered urgently, “Yvie, please don't go. My Grandpa is deceived by her, so he misunderstand you. If you leave me and Roseanne refuses to divorce, Graham Group will inevitably fall under her control, and my home will be destroyed.”

His earnest plea caused Yvonne to stop in her tracks. She turned to him and demanded, “You must resolve this matter today.”

“I will.” Brandon exhaled, then turned his gaze toward Kayden. “Grandpa, you didn't let me go abroad, so in my haste to get married, I misled you into thinking I liked Roseanne. It wasn't until I met Yvie that I understood what true love really is.”

Kayden's face remained stern, while Roseanne watched the two perform with a sarcastic gaze.

Brandon continued, “Yvie is currently the team leader at Kiefyose Medical Research Institute, and she has been invited to give lectures at several prestigious institutions. Her status is noble and she commands respect. Only someone like her is fitting to be the lady of the Graham family.”

Kiefyose Medical Research Institute, a top-tier international research institute, had stringent and tricky assessments. Even professors in the medical field couldn't necessarily pass these tests.

Surprisingly, Yvonne was the team leader.

Kayden's tone softened slightly as he said, “Since this was a misunderstanding, I apologize, Ms. Scott. However, the only woman who can be my grandson's wife is Roseanne.”

Brandon held Yvonne's hand tightly, his expression unwavering. “Grandpa, my mind is made up. If you try to stop us, Yvie and I will leave for Egrea, and we won't come back in this lifetime.”

The more one tries to prevent it, the more likely it is to backfire. If Brandon really ran off to Egrea with Yvonne, their home would be utterly ruined.

Kayden remained silent, his brows deeply furrowed.

The Graham family had few members left, and he had tragically lost his only son.

His grandson had no interest in business and was fully committed to studying medicine. His granddaughter was even worse—a total slacker. All play and no work.

They had let him down, so he had no choice but to place his hopes on his granddaughter-in-law. However, he never expected that Brandon would cheat on her.

He thought for a long time, guilt written all over his face. Turning to Roseanne, he sighed and said, “Rosie, the Graham family has wronged you. If you don't agree, I would rather die than let you two divorce.”

Brandon nervously held Yvonne's hand, fearing that Roseanne might refuse to grant the divorce.

Roseanne replied indifferently, “Since Brandon has someone he likes, there's no need for me to stay with the Graham family anymore.”

Kayden looked sorrowful. “The Sylvester family already has a daughter, so your return would be redundant. It's better for you to stay with the Graham family. I don't have many days left. After I'm gone, Graham Group will be yours.”

His grandson didn't want children, but there was still the option of in vitro fertilization. The child Roseanne would bear would still carry the Graham surname.

Graham Group would remain within the family.

Brandon's face was filled with displeasure. “Grandpa, how could Graham Group possibly be handed over to an outsider?”

Roseanne glanced at him casually and replied, “Grandpa, I managed just fine without the Sylvester family until I turned twenty, and I'll continue to do so. As for this marriage, if Brandon won't file for divorce, I will. I am not so forgiving as to tolerate his infidelity and still stay to manage the household.”

Kayden rubbed his temples, finally letting out a sigh. “You two leave. I need to have a chat with Rosie.”

Brandon had more to say, but Yvonne pulled him away.

Kayden gazed at Roseanne, his eyes filled with a mix of emotions. “Rosie, I can agree to your divorce.”

Just as Roseanne breathed a sigh of relief, Kayden continued, “But you initially invested five hundred million, so you can only take back that amount. You can't take the shares. I'll have the finance department arrange for your dividends from the past two years to be given to you as well.”

A touch of disbelief surfaced in Roseanne's eyes. “Why can I only take away five hundred million?”

Kayden explained, “Since you're divorced, you're no longer a part of the Graham family. It's inappropriate for you to hold four percent of Graham Group's shares.”

“Grandpa, I never intended to claim any part of the Graham family fortune; otherwise, I wouldn't have signed the prenuptial agreement. When Graham Group faced a financial crisis, with plummeting stock prices, I invested five hundred million and acquired four percent of the shares. I'm not just a part of your family. I'm also one of the shareholders of Graham Group.”

Roseanne's eyes grew colder as she grasped his intention. “I've poured my heart and soul into Graham Group, and now the shares have significantly appreciated, consistently trending upward. My contribution has been immense. You don't have to give me the shares, but I want 1.5 billion based on the current market valuation!”

Kayden's expression changed dramatically. He suppressed his shock and said, “That's simply out of the question. Including dividends and compensation, I'll offer you seven hundred million!”

Roseanne let out a cold, bitter laugh, her trust in Kayden completely shattered. “I see it now. The kindness you've shown me these past few years was only because I was useful, and I could bring benefits to Graham Group. I guess I misjudged you. You made me sign a prenuptial agreement. You're no better.”

Brandon was unaware of her sacrifices, and she could accept that.

But Kayden had seen everything she had done for the family. Now, he was treating her like an enemy, even trying to seize her shares.

With a steady gaze, Roseanne added, “Brandon cheated, and I can leave with nothing. I don't care about the Graham family's wealth, but what's mine is mine, and no one can take it away.”

Her mood shifted rapidly. Kayden coughed a few times, took a sip of coffee, and said in a resonant voice, “Rosie, I'm really grateful for your initial investment of five hundred million, which helped Graham Group. But I know your parents only gave you fifty million as a dowry.”

His words were diplomatic, yet Roseanne discerned their true meaning. She laughed mockingly. “It doesn't matter where the money came from; the fact is, I invested it.”

“You became a shareholder in Graham Group only after the marriage. Even before that, you signed a prenuptial agreement stating that you wouldn't take anything from the corporation. Seven hundred million is already a generous offer. I haven't even signed the share transfer document yet.”

A frosty glint appeared in Roseanne's eyes. “So, you had it all planned from the very start.”

Signing a prenuptial agreement was exactly what she wanted. After all, her assets were all over the place, and if she were to split them with Brandon, she would surely be at a loss.

She didn't care about this small share, but giving it to the Graham family for free was out of the question.

It was a bit of a hassle, but if she handed it over to the lawyer, she wouldn't have to spend much time on it.

Kayden stroked his beard, his deep-set eyes gleaming with wisdom. “One must know their place in life. Stirring up a big fuss won't do you any good. The Sylvester family won't help you, and opposing the Graham family is like throwing straws against the wind.”

When gentleness didn't work, he resorted to a more forceful approach.

A smirk played on Roseanne's lips. “If you're so eager to take my money, I'll just file a lawsuit.”

Continuing this conversation wouldn't lead to any resolution, and staying here was merely a waste of time.

Kayden scoffed. “I'd like to see which lawyer would dare to represent you and go against the Graham family.”

“Old Mr. Graham, you won't be around for much longer, so there's no need for you to worry.”

With that, Roseanne turned and walked away.

Kayden's face turned pale. Suddenly struggling to breathe, he shattered the cup in his hand.

Upon hearing the commotion, the butler hastily pushed open the door, only to be met with Roseanne's cold visage. Instinctively, he greeted her, “Mrs. Graham.”

“The Graham family is ruthless and greedy. I'm afraid I can't bear that title.”

Her tone was light and airy, carrying a hint of mockery.

The butler paused for a moment. After Roseanne left, he hastily rushed into the study.

Inside the car, Brandon furrowed his brows. “I really can't understand why Grandpa places such high importance on Roseanne, even considering giving her Graham Group.”

Yvonne had already done her on Roseanne. She said softly, “From what I know, Roseanne didn't make it to university. She barely scraped through middle school, skipping classes and getting into fights, bullying her peers. She simply doesn't have the capability to be a vice president.”

Brandon was taken aback. It was his first time hearing about Roseanne's affairs in the countryside, and he never imagined her to be a troublemaker.

Yvonne continued, “I knew about the crisis at Graham Group two years ago. When your grandfather fell ill, three directors took advantage of the situation, embezzled company funds, and fled abroad. Eventually, the police brought them back, and the credit should go to them. Somehow, rumors started circulating that Roseanne deserved the praise. People also said she secured several collaborations, stabilizing Graham Group. As for the five hundred million... The Sylvester family clearly doesn't care about Roseanne. Otherwise, they wouldn't have married her off as soon as they found her. There's no way they would have given a dowry of five hundred million; at most, a few tens of million. I suspect she's done something illegal. If it ever comes to light, it could potentially implicate Graham Group. ",1,1747382106.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

The feeling experienced and described as the hangover effect, is now new normal after 6 years of finding solutions.

How I did it.

* Switch diet to a Keto diet. This eliminates potential allergies and is good for the brain
* Switch to cold showering
* Take ice baths regularly
* Stop using screens outside of required work screen time, no more TV, no more Gaming
* Exercise at least 1 hour per day
* Stop drinking alcohol for 1 year
* No coffee after lunch
* No nicotine/cigarettes
* Daily breathwork
* If tired, take daytime naps
* Dont use any meds

Took about 4 to 6 months of living like the above and then it was solved.

Some info I think will be useful: I am a 21 year old full-time student and also work part-time. I plan to use the card only to put my phone bill and car insurance payment on, a total of $200.33 a month. I currently have no credit history, I only have a debit card through Discover and a savings account with Ally Bank. My goal is just to build a credit score for when I need it in the future, basically just for housing.

My biggest areas of uncertainty are: What kind of card, secured or student? And what perks should I get? Cashback seems like the obvious answer, but travel points seem pretty cool, although I don't currently travel.

I would appreciate some ideas and recommendations! 

Thank you for reading!  


CREDIT PROFILE

\* Current credit cards you are the primary account holder of: None

\* FICO Scores with source: No credit score or history according to Credit Karma

\* Oldest credit card account age with you as primary name on the account: N/A

\* Annual income $: Estimated $16,000ish

CATEGORIES

\* OK with category-specific cards?: Yes? Not sure it would be applicable in my case

\* OK with rotating category cards?: Again, not really applicable I think

\* Estimate average monthly spend in the categories below. 

\* Dining $: $70-80 (this is just on coffee T-T ) (To be fair I buy for other people too)

\* Groceries $: $80 at Walmart almost exclusively, mostly just delivery expenses because I have my groceries delivered

\* Gas $: N/A

\* Travel $: N/A

\* Do you plan on using this card abroad for a significant length of time (study abroad, digital nomad, expat, extended travel)?: No

\* Any other categories or stores  with significant, regular credit card spend : $147.59 at Dairyland Insurance for car insurance, and $52.74 for phone service at T-Mobile

MEMBERSHIPS & SUBSCRIPTIONS 

\* Currently paying $13.99/month or more for Disney Bundle (Disney+ / Hulu / EPSN+) or other Hulu services? I receive Hulu+ads free with my Spotify student membership ($5.99 per month)

\* Current member of Chase, US Bank or any other big bank?: Currently have a Discover debit account

\* Active US military?: No

\* Are you open to Business Cards?: No, not applicable

PURPOSE

\* What's the purpose of your next card?: First card, not authorized on any other card

\* Do you have any cards you've been looking at? The credit cards in the Discover ecosystem seem appealing both because, as I understand from this forum, they are pretty good and I already have a debit account with Discover. However, I've heard that the Discover secured card doesn't upgrade to a very attractive unsecured card, but their student cards seem pretty good. I've also seen CapitalOne recommended a lot, so that caught my eye. ",1,1747381716.0,CreditCards,1,1.0,False

This recipe comes from my Slavic culture. We call it ""Vatrushky"".The main ingredient is soft farmer's cheese/quark (sold in foil packaging), and honestly, I'm not even sure if it exists in America—let me know!
Anyway, for those of you who are familiar with this ingredient, here’s the recipe!

Ingredients:
- 250g farmer's cheese (150g for the dough and 100g for the filling)
- 70g flour
- 20g vanilla whey protein
- 1 egg
- Sweetener to taste

Filling:
- About 20g Greek yogurt
- 10g whey protein
- The remaining farmer's cheese
- Sweetener to taste
- Raspberries/blueberries or... anything you like! (I used about 40g raspberries and few blueberries)
 
Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 180°C (356°F).
2. Mix all the dough ingredients in one bowl and work the dough until it’s firm (though slightly sticky in texture).
3. Divide the dough into 5 balls and flatten them into small rounds on a baking sheet.
4. Mix all the filling ingredients and spoon it onto the rounds.
5. Top with your choice of fruit.
6. Bake at 180°C for about 20 minutes.

I recommend serving with tea or coffee—it's a perfect snack to take on the go or a great breakfast option.

And don't forget to let me know how you liked it!

**Dear Body,**

I see you.  
Not just for what you do—but for how you *stay*.   
For how you carry me through every moment, even the ones that feel impossible.

You are strong—not because you power through, but because you endure with softness.   
Because you whisper *“I’m still here”* even when I forget to listen.

You give me so much:  
The warmth of a shower. The taste of coffee.   
The scent of my baby’s head. The feeling of sunlight on my skin.  
You are how I touch the world.  
You are how I *feel*.

You are also how I orient in the world.  
Even when my mind is tangled or racing, you tell me the truth.  
You let me know when something’s not right—and when it is.  
You bring me back to myself with sensation, with stillness, with presence.

And you are beautiful.  
Not because of a standard. Not because of anyone else’s gaze.  
But because you hold my spirit, my softness, my strength.  
Because you let me be here—alive and real and whole.

Thank you for being patient with me.  
Thank you for being my home.  
Thank you for letting me come back again and again.

I promise to keep softening toward you.  
I promise to keep returning.

With love,

There I met 2 peeps and we got into a trio. So it me (18M), my friend (19M) and other (18F). So the guy let's call him aryan had a crush on girl (let's call her aditi). So i helped aryan on the talking stage later he confessed it to aditi and she accepted the proposal. We three got more close and one day aditi called us for lunch as we both were living in pg and missed home food. So when we went there we got to know that she's a super rich girl just by looking at the house 

We were just chilling in her room and her mom came in and as usual we both stood up and touched her feet but in the mid way she stopped us and said it's alright yk the usual stuff. She asked us to move into a different room as the maid had to clean it so we sat in her parents' room. There aditi asked me to look for remote and while checking the drawers i came accross a condom, vibrator (and it was wet) and a bottle of lube but I just closed it but her mom was standing outside and ig she saw me that I saw the stuff but she didn't asked me about that. Later while having lunch her mother join us and she was a really nice lady, super chill and friendly. 

We were just joking around and somehow we all exchanged socials. Ngl she really had a good figure and was very young to be a mom who's daughter is 19. Nvm then we left. 

In a coming few weeks i was like her mom's stories and the latest posts and she did the same. One day she texted me on my story and we had a little chit chat. She asked me if her daughter is dating you but then i said no no we are just good friends, she is like a sis to me. Then finally the question came, i saw you opening that drawer i hope you didn't feel awkward..then what could I have said, so i replied no no it's alright and then i forgot that she is my friends mom and we both are legit talking about sex life, self pleasure, love, getting physical what not I mean. 

It got a thing that every weekend we were going to her house for lunch and some how I felt good around her mother as she was really chill. 

One day she texted me that no one's home and she needs to get some meds, so I got the meds and booked a rapido to her house and when I came i thought the meds were for her daughter but it was for her and legit no one was home except us. 
That day she was dripping with sweat and I offered her some help with meds. Later on I was sitting and she got some coffee and while drinking it she came a bit closer to me and then we started having deep Convos about life and later got shifted to the topic of boldnesss (yeah my fault shouldn't have engaged it) but now it was to late. 
I was telling her about my breakup story which was sad actually so she kissed me on my cheeks and forehead and then hugged me. Suddenly she stood up and went to room, she changed her dress and came out wearing a bathing robe. 

She sat very close to me and then showed me her nudes while seducing me. I was taken a back what the f is going on. She then got naked and tried removing my t shirt and she started kissing me, at first I enjoyed it when I thought about it i stood up and shouted what are you even thinking. I was mismerised by her beauty and curves but no she was like 45 can't take a risk. I tried to ran away but she caught me and said I'm sorry idk what I'm doing and started crying. I consoled her and left as soon i could 

She texted me on insta about what happened and I never replied to it and now I'm not even friends with her daughter. Sometimes I think I did the right thing, sometimes its like I missed a chance",1,1747381266.0,confessions,0,1.0,False

Job pays 3000 dollars. 10 cats, 7 dogs and a pin of pigs. Food and booze are included. More details on phone if your serious about this.""

The last part included the phone number to call.
Wow. I thought.
Watch some animals for a week for 3k? 
That sounds like easy money. Too easy. I'll  call the number, but I don't expect to get the job. But then after the rush from the pay calmed, I realised that the location was undisclosed. The post did say more details over the phone. And when I called, the man who answered the phone, also answered all my questions. He said his name was vore. 

Its far. Really far from the town it was posted in, about a 4 hour drive, out in the deep country of Michigan. As there was no stores or gas station near his home, he offered to refill my gas when I got there, as he had according to him, plenty of the stuff on the property I could use to refill my car. On the phone, the man was still unsure how long he will be gone. But he assured me it wouldn't be longer than a week.

So. A week at the most, with food, gas and even alcohol thrown into the mix, for a nice payout just to watch and care for some cats, dogs And a few pigs. All for a solid 3000 dollars? I was of course ready and willing to do this. He said only a few called but turned the offer down because it was so far away. But not for me. Not for a few grand and a different set of mind that I could experience. My life has been on autopilot for weeks since she left. It was a good thing for me to mix things up. I mean I miss the woods, and the country. So I guess you could say I was very excited for this small adventure in my life, i can't wait to meet all of the animals. 




The road seemed to keep stretching as I drove, no turns for the last two hours, just tree's left and right. but I knew it was the right road and direction. So I kept on driving. Gas is under a quarter of a tank. He better have that gas he talked about (even though I brought my own full can just incase.) The skies were darkening, and the tempature dropping steadily, it was the middle of April, and the forecast said tempature drops tonight to 45° with thunderstorms around 7:30 8:00 and stretch possibly into the morning. But that was the forecast from home. As the sun dropped, I couldn't help but feel uneasy as I kept driving through these dark dank freaky twisted woods. 

""Cmon, how much farther is this place?""
I exclaimed to myself, starting to get irritated after being on the road for so long.  

While driving, the land was still lit up enough to see decently into the woods, but farther back, left and right, it seeped darkness. Like the shadow of the woods was ready to consume it but the sun halted it's endeavor, for now. Soon the dark will have it's turn, and the dark will roll, and hopefully I can get there before that happens.


Some time later, Driving down the dark dirt road, only headlights shining the way, the blur of a white splotchy light creeped through the twigs and showing a bright light casting through the trees. when I pulled up to the property, relief settled in as I finally made it. 

While slowly turning into the short drive, vore, stood tall in front of a big tree. Right at the end of the short driveway. He had one hand up in a greeting posture and another in his pocket, with squinted eyes, he waved his hand a bit. I didn't expect him to be waiting outside in the dark for me. Kinda weird I thought, but moved passed it quickly. 

After parking and stepping put of my truck, it was time to meet vore face to face. 

""You finally made it!""
""Haha, I thought you got lost out there in those woods."" Vore said as he reached down on the ground and picked up a lantern. Switching it on, it was a powerful light.

Vore was pretty tall, around 6'3. And his hair was scraggly and black. Shoulder length. He was wearing a black shirt covered by an unbuttoned worn down red and black checkered flannel with blue jeans and a ball cap on backwards. Noticeably, he had a big shiny wedding ring on his ring finger that held the lantern.


""Well it was one road for miles, so I knew I was on the right track. Nice to meet you.""


""Nice to meet ya too, I reckon, your a bit tired after all that driving now.""
After we shook hands, vore fiddled with the lantern and the light receded a bit. 

""Yeah I have never drove this far ever in my life with no stops. It's pretty draining.""

""I see, Well let's head up to the house.""

There was no mistaking the home here, it wasn't a house it was a trailer. Which did take me by surprise. The light I seen was actually from the shed right behind the trailer, must have glowed through the window. As he lead me to the front porch, I could feel the temperature drop more. It's getting colder and later in the night, it's normal. But for some reason, I felt it was heavier in this moment. 


As we walked into the front door, vore turned some lights on. we were immediately in the living room and to my right, he aimed me to the kitchen which was the end of the front of the trailer. 
He motioned for me to sit at the table. So I did. I noticed multiple cats infesting the living room and kitchen as he kept Turning lights on.

""Alright first of all, thank you for doing this for me, I had quite a some trouble trying to find someone to help me.""

""No problem, thank you for the job, 3k is alot of doe, so thank you. 

""Your welcome, now let me inform ya what needs to be done around here.""


I sat there just waiting for the list of jobs, and vore walked around the table and sat across from me. Straight to business I guess. 


""Okay here's the list of things I want you to aquire while I'm gone. And the stuff that needs done as well of course.""

Aquire?


""Take care of my animals first and foremost. Right? I mean, who doesn't love their animals especially if they have 20 of em? make sure they eat, and get water everyday, right when you wake up. Then feed em again later on around 1 or 2 then finally once more in the evening. As for the pigs, that old broke down Truck back there in the backyard has loaves of bread in it. Tailgate is locked, but the key and others I got I left on the coffee table there all on a ring. Give each pig two loafs twice a day. The secondary job is just water my weed plants. There are 3 of them. Two behind the trailer, 1 in front across the road.  I'll show ya where they are exactly before I leave.""

""You said something about acquiring? You didn't mention that on the phone."" 

""Yeah I'm sorry bout that, it's nothing big just need ya to take the road up they way you didn't come and you will see a clearing with some fences. Inside those fences are a big ol pile of wood you can't miss it. I need you to haul back this wood and store it behind the shed in the backyard. The county sold it to me last week and I haven't had the time to get it. I was gonna offer ya to use my tractor and trailer. But you can use ur truck if you rather. Remember I got gas in the shed as well.""

""Oh okay well how long does it take to get there?""

""About 10 minutes. Might take you 2 trips though it's a decent pile of wood, but the other thing I need you to get is not gonna be ready until Wednesday. I got a guy other side of them woods behind the trailer that owes me something. Now he's old and don't get out much so your gonna have to go an get it. Don't worry about what it is aint nothing illegal I can assure you but It needs to be picked up sometime on Wednesday. Make sure you do not forget it. There's a trail back there the only one,  you just follow it and it will lead to his house.""

""I can handle that""

I was distracted by a couple cats in the living room that were playing and running around, while the others just watched. My gaze turned from them to vore. He stared at me for a few seconds and flashed a crooked smile. 

""So I reckon you can handle all of that then? He stood up and pinned the piece of paper to the refrigerator with a ham magnet. Like the type of delicious looking ham you see in the cartoons. 

""Umm yeah it all seems straight forward.""

""Good Good, food in the fridge of course and that booze I talked about is right there on the counter. Its a whole liter of whiskey now so dont get too drunk and burn my place down ya hear?""

We both shared a laugh but it was short lived as he quickly stopped and started looking at me seriously, analyzing me. 

""But seriously I come back and this place is burnt down to the ground or if anyone of my animals is hurt, or dies..... well best not to get into that, I'm sure you'll do fine.

That was strange, I get where he's coming from but I'm almost 30 man Im not gonna burn down the property or kill any of your animals. Just a weird shift in conversation that quickly turned kinda dark. After a few seconds of silence, he spoke again.

""Speaking of animals, this little boy right here is the light of my life, his name is roscoe.""

A little lap dog pomeranian ran up to him as he picked him up. 

""Please take extra care of him, I found this sucker 1 year ago on the road while I was traveling. He was lost and scared shitless. But now he's as happy as ever.""

""Of course vore all your animals will be well taken care of, I really love animals myself it's another reason why I took this job honestly.""

""Yeah that's good, the other one's must be sleeping somewhere I don't see em, but their name is Lucy and stifler, Lucy is a pomeranian too and stifler is a terrier.""

""Its alot of animals you got here, it's gonna be kinda hard to get all there names right.""

""No worries, over there on the that shelf Is a book of photos with them and their names. So if you wanna learn em there ya go.""

""Oh wow, I guess you thought of everything..""


""Okay, down the hall is the bedroom then bathroom. But if you wanna wanna kick it on that couch I don't give a damn what you do, but just leave my room alone. It's locked anyways. So don't even think about trying to get in there.""

""Oh of course I won't even touch the handle you don't have to worry one bit.""

""Good""

""my cell number is on that fridge too, if you need to try to get ahold of me, now I'll be on the road alot so I'm not sure if I'll always have reception.""
 
It seems it started sprinkling outside, the tiny raindrops slowly and sporadically tapping on the roof, outside the kitchen window, lightning flashing and a few seconds later thunder slightly rumbling in the distance. As vore stood up he grabbed a duffle bag on the couch and told me one last thing. 

""So we may be out in tha middle of no man's land here, and not many come driving through here too, but if anything out of the ordinary or a possibly dangerous situation does occur, I have a shotgun in that gun case there.""

He pointed and nodded with his head in the corner of the living room. 

""It's unlocked and the gun is loaded with a few extra shells inside the case. But as I said No one really comes around here, you should be all alone for the next 3 to 7 days.""

""That does ease my mind, I gotta say it's pretty creepy all the way out here.""

""Haha that it is, we're out deep in tha sticks here chance, but I'm sure you'll do just fine.""

Kettle 2:
16g Kimbo Intenso / 160ml / Timemore 15 clicks / Aeropress filter / Room temperature water and 3/4 heat setting on the stove

Kettle 1 was much better balanced and dense, chocolatey, espresso-like, less bitter / less green taste.

I (30F) met my fiancé (29M) in the military when we were in recruitment training. He was fresh out of a relationship where he had been cheated on, and I was not interested in getting into anything after 2 previously bad relationships. We laughed together, didn't judge eachothers past, and we went on lots of adventures and did the same things that at the time i thought we both liked. I left the military after a year and went back to my hometown, but we did long distance really well, and after 2 years of being together, he proposed, and i was over the moon. 3 months later, i packed up my life and my job at home and moved 3 hours away closer to the military base so we could start our lives as a couple. I really thought I found my soul mate, but after moving in together, i started noticing he wasn't ideal to live with. He's a slob, and when he does clean (after I ask him), he does it halfway, and I end up doing it again. He'd nit pick at little things I did, which were mostly being clumsy. I really don't think I'm perfect I've been a disorganised mess my whole life and wasn't great with money, as well as struggling to basically be an adult but I try to do everything with good intentions and I started feeling like nothing I was doing was right. We fought constantly, and there was one occasion where the police were called when we had friends staying over and too many drinks were had where a fight broke out. A month after moving in together, I was miserable and then found out I was pregnant. We put our differences aside, and things got a lot better, but I didn't enjoy pregnancy. I gained a lot of weight, I was always tired, and I had swelling and BP problems. He didn't come to any of the appointments unless they were scans, he didn't want to be intimate as soon as he found out because he said no guy wants to sleep with a pregnant person, but he stopped showing any affection or sign that he was attractive to me. I paid for all the baby things or got them from my sister. He got nothing. I started getting better with money and organising life while he smoked weed, went golfing and watched TV, or played Xbox. If there was any sign of things needing to be done on a day off, he got annoyed because he wanted to do nothing. He started showing he was easily set off to the point where I stopped bothering to communicate anything I felt bothering me and I noticed he wouldn't really listen to me when I'd tell him about my day. I struggled because I was away from my family, and we were a good 30-minute drive from any friends.

Cut to our beautiful baby boy arriving. I was induced a week early and had a rough birth. I was in labour for over 24 hours and ended up having an emergency section after pushing for 2 hours. He fell over running to his car a few days prior with a bowl of porridge in his hand so his knee was hurting him, and I wasn't to forget that WHEN I WAS IN LABOUR. It got to the point where the midwives were caring for him, too. But our beautiful boy arrived (I'll call him T) and we were so so happy. I was on rest for 6 weeks, and I could see he was making an effort to take care of me so i could take care of T (i was/am breastfeeding). The house got messy, and he didn't really clean, but our moms came and helped at times. 

As time went on i started noticing he was nearly more immature than before and didnt seem interested in holding T and when id ask him to change a nappy hed have a mental breakdown so i gave up asking. He continued to be bad with money, and i was paying for food, etc, halfway through the week while on maternity leave. If i asked him to hold T for a minute hed ask why and if it was to get something he'd insist on gwtting it for me and when i said i want to get it myself (because ive learned new moms need a break sometimes) he would follow me around with T and say to T ""you want mommy dont you, whats she doing?"". He would get excited about being intimate, and i honestly wanted to run away at the thought of it and still do. He's always wound me up a d would push me to the limit before he'd stop, but I have less patience for it because I'm caring for T. I'm always was and am the one cooking, and if I ask him to cook, it's nearly like he wants a gold star. Looking back, I think I was blind to things that i ignored over the years, for example:

1. Any occasions like Xmas, Valentines, birthdays, I made an effort to get /make something thoughtful (e.g., painting the constellations of the night of our anniversary and getting a zippo lighter with an engravement), but our first Xmas i got nothing but a promise that my presents were ordered and in the post (never got them) and this has happened at least once a year. I'm still waiting for a set of dumbells, a couples date book, a foot bath (never expressed wanting one). I never let it get to me at the time. I just told myself I love him, and it's the thought that counts (literally).

2. His hygiene. I'm embarrassed even writing this, but he never brushed his teeth because they were crowns, so he thought he didn't have to. I only discovered this down the line because of the military setting, so there weren't many opportunities to see that. The first time I mentioned it, I jokingly said, ""I'm not going to kiss you until you brush your teeth,"" and he said, ""You sound like my mam."" Since we've moved in together, I've also discovered that he only showers once a week, and I struggle to be near him.

3. Indecisiveness. I'm all for finding yourself and trying different career paths and honbies until you find the right one, but his was dizzying to watch. In the space of a year he was leaving/staying in the military 3 times, he was going back to construction work, he started a barbering course and didn't finish and went for a truck driving licence that he passed 1 of 3 tests for but never finished again. Remember this point!!

4. I don't think he likes my mom. My mom is my hero! She raised 4 kids on her own because our dad was/is a chronic alcoholic (I cut him out) and has been living with MS for nearly 30 years. She's a strong woman and has good boundaries set, but she's always there no matter what. He complains about her asking me to do things when I come visit (I agreed when I was pregnant but never minded otherwise) and called her rude for playing the radio loud one day. He never says anything good about her and he always talks about how amazing his mom is and I wouldn't dream of saying a bad word about her to him (especially because he's a mommas boy) but she's by no means perfect... she raised this mess of a human!!!

5. He says, ""i love you"" too much.. hear ne out! I love love, but there was one time I counted, and he said it about 30 times in one day, and i never got to say it first to the point where those words lose meaning! He says it as if he has nothing else to say, and I get a bit uncomfortable. 

So now... he's been in and out of sea the last 4 months (in a month out a month), and when he's gone, I'm completely on my own with T ... BUT I LOVE IT. I stay with my mom for a week or two, and I feel like I didn't know what help was beforehand. I go to the gym for an hour some days or have a shower in peace or have an extra hour in bed some mornings because my mom offered, and then i learned to ask. One of my flaws is I don't like asking people to do things for me and I don't really ask him to watch T which is my fault but I also don't trust him because he cant even change a nappy. When I go back to my house, it's clean, it's calm, there's routine and I'm happy. When he's back, it's the opposite, and I'm miserable, irritable, and distant, and I don't really like myself because of it. He's bonded more with T now that he's bigger and after a talk a few months ago he was making more of an effort because he knew I was thinking of leaving him but it's been going back to the old way slowly but surely. 

I feel I should include this. Also, I found out from my best friend a few months ago that he borrowed money from her and another friend to buy the engagement ring but never paid them back. I said it during the discussion, and he said he forgot (he loves to brag how good his memory is). He since paid my friend back, but that caused a lot of tension, and I now don't wear the ring unless I have to because it feels tainted..

Remember the job jumping? His latest one is to transfer to a base three hours away close to the area im from, which means he'll be gone weekdays and everyone around me seems concerned but I honestly would rather he not be around. I don't want T growing up in a broken home but I honestly don't know how much more I can take of it, and I'm trying to push past the feelings just in case its post partum hormones fuelling the fire but I'm honestly so tired of feeling like a nag and a moody person. 

I want to say that even though I'm saying all this, he really isn't a bad person at heart, he brings me home coffees after work, gets my favourite chocolate for me in the shop and he loves T undoubtedly. He wants this relationship to work and has been trying since a big talk we had, but I feel it's too late because in my mind it won't last, and he's only doing it to stay out of the dog house and I feel so guilty for rejecting his good deeds.

So WIBTAH if I broke up with my fiance? I'm sorry my writing is all over the place, I've wanted to post here for a while but didn't know how to fit it all in, and I'm sure I've left stuff out!",3,1747380576.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

I’ve just returned to using the Coffee Chronicler switch recipe after a while away.

I use 15g coffee and abaca filters. I grind with a k-ultra.

The suggested drawdown time for his recipe is 2.45 - 3.15

I do hit the bottom end of that with some coffees, but for most, I get the best cups with a drawdown around 2.30.

I’m just interested in what explains the discrepancy. 

I assume CC also uses abaca or similar 

I think his baseline recipe is 20g coffee 300g water, so 5g/50g higher than mine, but it doesn’t feel like that would impact draw down time by a minimum of 15 seconds ",2,1747380183.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

I’m open to a long-distance relationship, but only with the understanding that we eventually meet. I’m not looking for something that stays online forever. Ideally, you’re someone who’s willing and able to travel , whether that means visiting me or meeting halfway.

I’m tired of connections that get stuck in the “talking stage” and never grow into something meaningful. I’m ready to be upfront and genuine from the start.

A little about me:
I’m a coffee and matcha snob, a fan of slow days and quiet moments. I enjoy both intellectual and completely nonsensical banter , anything from deep philosophical tangents to laughing about the dumbest things and sharing random thoughts throughout the day. 

Podcasts are my constant companions, and I meditate to stay grounded. I’m a creative soul with a soft spot for food, history, and film , especially the kind that makes you feel something. Basically, if you’re into cozy energy and thoughtful vibes, we might just get along.

Also for transparency: I’m on the curvy/thicc side. If that’s not your thing, no hard feelings , let’s not waste each other’s time. And I have absolutely no patience for body-shaming.

What I’m looking for:

	•	Someone emotionally available and serious about building a real connection

	•	Someone who enjoys deep conversations and long, random chats

	•	Someone who values communication, effort, and honesty

	•	Someone ready to match energy and intentions

If any of this resonates with you, send me a message with a quick intro, who you are and what you’re looking for. I appreciate sincerity over flash.

1knus0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/attitudinalpsyche/comments/1knus0t/fvle_or_vlfe/,fvle or vlfe?,"im finding it hard to identify my will since i had a mix of it in the present time and back then. ill probably write down first befoee the others what i think matches me best: 

logic:
— i love chatting about my interests or things that i enjoy discovering—to specific people whom i think will have interests too. i do often start arguments or probably questions that can lead to arguments hehe when i see someone who i think is smarter than me or if their beliefs opposites mine. ive been called having a sharp tounge when i speak and ask deep questions that i dont realize often. i also get called fast-on-hand when thinking in front when speaking—i get picked very often to take the initiate to lead when speaking since i have a loud voice and i can prepare without memorizing something, i find it hard to memorize since i often shift to other words and cant really stay on track wirh what i memorize because i can think of different(best) words that i think i can apply. when it comws to groupings, if im not cautious with logic, i could just bluntly speak and answer the question taht was assign to us then ill probably forget some when they ask me to repeat it again but i can still create sometimes. im interested in a lot of things and i love delving deeper. i want to talk about it with someone but i dont have the energy to do it and also i dont find someone who will enjoy it.

physics: 
— im cautious of my surroundings. i find it hard to do discomforting activities—walking in mud, washing the dishes. i also hate the sound of spoons rubbing in another spoon, it makes me have goosebumps especially if im also cautious of what im doing yahahahahah though
i often challenge myself wirh it, trying to tell myself that im probably just thinking about it and not really triggered. i dont really like physical fights either, ive noticed this since i was a kid cause my friends knows how to fight and i just think of myself that im probably scared—i hate fights cause i think if i punch the other person and they punch me ill get hurt, thats the thought of it, nothing else. i also think ill lose. i hate the thought of fighting. i also have a phobia with dogs and a lot of insects, im triggered with dogs and i could probably say i have ptsd with it now and im fearful of it—i do try regaining strength and telling myself that im bigger than it. i love martial arts even if i dont like fighting cause i finr energy there even though im still not trying to try out. im not really neat wirh my surroundings, as long as im comfortable, ill be fine. like if i think my bed is clean even if the floor is quite of messy, its okay. i dont also like when people are giving me suggestions on how to treat my body—it either annoys me or brushes it off and tell them its an alternative reason cause ive search about it before they even ask or know it. when i need to go somewhere, i usually carry a lot of things to feel at home cause i think if i dont carry the same things i use when im taking a bath, its not perfect. 

emotions:
you could say i can understand someone's emotions or have a gut feeling of theirs sometimes. when im in a gathering and im there with people who knows me being joyful, i tend to be someone like taht even though i dont feel any joy inside of me. its hard also for me to cry cause i cant really feel it and i want to feel it cause i think in that way i can understand whats wrong with me or probably align what could probably the underlying problem with me which i think is empathy or being spiritual bur the thought of it makes me angry cause i feel limited with being spritual, its also the reason i left my religion cause i felt limited. its hard for me to show empathy, if i do show, i just brushed it off when people comment about it cause i get shy—serving them coffee, being happy around them. but when i do feel my emotions like crying or anger, it can be intense. i can cry in my room privately and i can feel like im gasping for air and it cant stop sometimes. when im angry i cant also stop. 

voltage:
i typed myself as a result 1V cause 1V matches me when i have a goal—i can invision goals and take it with care but right now since i became more cautious—i think im a process 3V. when i have a goal, i dont really pay attention on my mental relam or physical realm—if i want an edit to be perfect, i work for it even if i cant sleep anymoee but also there are two choices which can get in my mind: do it on risk and tell im satisfied about it even if not or just do it cause im still not satisfied. i can remember correctly that i was a perfectionist but i suppose im not now—i dont know but there were a sudden shift with my energy and i think its because i became withdrawn with people and isolated myself. i also got raise in a higher rank in position a year after i did all of this, close to the top but after that i felt all realization and i dont know i fail in leadership again. my vision became blurry, i felt more threatened in that class cause i suppose i felt an impact with the sudden fail of my leadership, i also felr aloof of doing tasks and often reject it sometimes(knowing well that im still going to organize it and end up the leader cause its either no one is initiating to do it which i can also be the assistant since i dont like it when someone is commanding me or its because i gor a sudden rush of vision or resulr that i know well will disappear again). i got used on how i seen before you know? i got used to it. i do say to myself that whatever it is if i am a 3V then its going to be okay but the thought of being a process thinker bothers me cause i dont really focus on it, i have a sense of energy when im okay and i do things great, i can be a perfectionist. i was also naturally commanding before, i shut people's up with a gaze of a gesture not for  external validation but i think i want them to respect me when i speak or when im explaining something. i dont really have the initiate to do all of this right now cause i dont have the energy and i also dont have a goal in mind. it bothers me also cause i became more of a process thinker where i just do things (physically like excerxsing) even though i dont have a set goal there but probably because i just want to feel a sense of feeling taht i can be okay. motivation outside my system doesn't also works if i think im not okay inside, thats what i always tell. i usually think its because ive forgot about the set boundaries and limitations i put people on it. i also feel suffocated thinking all about this, i think im burnt out or something i dont know. i dont also like doing things that crosses a moral on me like gossiping cause i think gossiping is a sign of insecurity. im not also keen to trends or things that are ubiquitous, especially in clothing. i find myself picking something that i think ill be comfortable with or ill look cool.

I have a professional resume i made all by myself. papa murphys was a great easy job but we got shut down because the owner didn’t pay his bills. kroger was my favorite job being autistic. all i had to do was pick out groceries with limited interaction with people other than my coworkers. long story short my store had unprofessional management and i was treated terribly causing me to quit.

Silver City.

A Megalopolis with around one hundred thousand inhabitants. Despite being rather modern, it's unique geographic location makes it rather isolated from any other big cities, as it's surrounded by a forest in the east, and the sea on the west. Its most unique feature, however, is probably one-third of its population being werewolves. That's right. Over thirty thousand werewolves, a hundred thousand humans, and... me.

I frown, staring behind the window once again. Silver City's dawn is pretty and quiet. The sky shines with the first sunlight, with shades of pink and purple in the clouds. I open the window, feeling some nice fresh air. It's really early, we're at the end of May. I wonder what all those people are doing, in the streets and skyscrapers. I'm fascinated by the tallest buildings. I wonder what it's like to see the world from up there. Do you feel like you belong in when you watch the streets from so high?

I'm on the second floor, and I can't understand what it could be like down there, or up there.

""Knock knock, I'm looking for the little witch in room five?""

I turn around, with a smile.

Kelsi is waiting, pretending to knock on my door with a little frown on. She's wearing her ugly mint green sweatshirt, the one with a big comic cat on it, some jeans, and her usual multi-colored backpack.

""Hi. They let you in so early?"" I ask, a bit surprised.

""Yep. Apparently your sister gave them instructions that I could come in and out as I please. I'm pretty much a full-time VIP plus one now.""

""Oh...""

Kelsi drops her bag and comes to hug me gently, being careful about my bandages. She glares at the big bracelet around my wrist, grabbing it with a frown. It's flashing with a little green light every ten seconds and quite heavy too.

""Still there?""

""Still there,"" I sigh.

""Mh...""

Then, she takes a step back, pulling her long black hair behind her ears, and takes on a falsely severe expression behind her thick glasses.

""Alright, miss Garnett, morning check-up.""

""Oh seriously, Kelsi? again?"" I protest.

""What's my name?""

I sigh, and nod, deciding to comply. I take a deep breath.

""Kim Eun-Kyung,"" I recite, ""You've been my roommate for over one year and as far as I know, you're probably my only friend. You go by the name of Kelsi Kim because you hate hearing people mispronounce it. You're two months older than me, a photography student and a geek... and you like ugly cat sweaters.""

""Good girl,"" she says with a big smile; ""How are you feeling?""

""Still like a total stranger to myself,"" I sigh, sitting on my bed.

""Your temperature?""

I show her the black screen of my watch with a grimace.

""They deactivated the screen since they found out I used it to test...""

""Oh, crap. No more experiments, then.

""No...""

She nods, and suddenly grabs her bag with a spark of excitation in her eyes. It's an old and very used one, but apparently, she loves it enough to have covered the many holes with some funny patches. Kelsi takes out an envelope, barely hiding her enthusiasm.

""You found some new pictures?"" I ask.

""Yep! Well, you already know we didn't take many together, but I found some new ones from a party you apparently went to, two months before we moved in together. I had to chat with some weird guy who was borderline a creep, but anyway, I got these and printed them out for you. Look!""

I take the pictures, a bit hesitant. This is already the sixth batch of pictures Kelsi as found for me, but just like the five previous times, I don't recognize anything on it. I spread them on my bed, and it even takes me a minute to find myself on it. It looks like some party in a big nightclub, with more people I don't recognize. In the pictures, I am wearing a white sequins top and some black leather pants, and I am dancing on heels in the middle of a wild crowd. My hair seems longer, too, and straightened. Kelsi only selected the pictures I appear in, but I never seem to be the main focus. I'm always in the middle of a random group, or in the background...

""Still nothing?"" She asks, biting her thumb.

I shake my head. I only recognize myself, and that's because I've spent hours in front of a mirror since I woke up, trying to remember who I am. No one else in those pictures reminds me of anything. It's so infuriating. I can't put a name on a face, or on a place... Even what I'm wearing in those pictures doesn't remind me of anything.

""Did the guy say anything about me?"" I ask.

""Not really"", she sighs, shaking her head. ""He had no idea who you were when I found you on his profile pictures. He's never heard of Clarissa Garnett, or a girl called Mara. He said he took a lot of pictures because it was his first university party, but he didn't even seem to know half of the people there.""

""Okay... Well, thank you anyway for trying, Kelsi.""

""I'm sorry it didn't work again, Boo.""

""It can't be helped. It would be weird if my memory came back all at once.""

I really don't want to make Kelsi feel bad about it. She's the only person who comes to visit me almost every day since she's been allowed to, and literally lightens my whole day up. She's been trying hard to help me fill in the gigantic hole of my past, bringing stuff that supposedly belongs to me, or the pictures she could find. She pouts, playing with her sweater's laces, still staring at the pictures.

""I don't recognize anyone from the university either, but I can ask my friends. Maybe someone knows someone from your department who knows more about you.""

""Thanks.""

""Well, at least you're sexy! I always noticed you had good tastes in clothes. Aren't you tired of the hospital gown?""

I nod. I hate it, but with all the bandages covering my burns, it's the only thing I can put on easily without grimacing all the time. Kelsi did bring me a bag of clothes, but trying to put on a pair of jeans was so painful I cried. She puts back the pictures in the envelope and leaves it on my bedside table.

""I'd definitely suck as a detective, I could only find thirty pictures of you in six weeks, and I took half of them. I officially suck.""

""Don't say that, you're the best. It's not your fault I was a loner.""

""I still can't believe you didn't have any freaking social media. You're an alien, or born in the wrong century!""

""You still haven't found my laptop?""

""No..."" she pouts. ""The last time I saw you with it was one morning before I went to Uni, you were in the kitchen, typing something. I don't think I saw you with it after that, and then there was the accident...""

It's so infuriating. It's already annoying enough that I have amnesia, but now, I can't even retrieve the biggest clues about my own life. I know the smartphone I had got burnt in the fire, along with any belonging I had, even my clothes. The police officer that came said they only found the remains of a leather bag and a matching purse, but more could have burnt, and they weren't going to spend time analyzing ashes...

""Did your sister come by at all this week?"" Asks Kelsi.

""No... Too busy, they said.""

""Damn, your family is weird. They are too busy to visit you, but they pay for a private room in this fancy hospital.""

""I feel like the room is more of a security measure than special treatment. They probably don't have time to take care of their crazy younger sister...""

Kelsi frowns, and grabs my chin to lift it and have me look at her.

""Listen to me, Boo. You're not crazy. You're a gorgeous piece of woman, and a bad-ass witch, okay?""

Her very serious expression immediately lifts my spirits up. I nod.

""With a crazy friend who says so,"" I chuckle.

She smiles back at me.

""Exactly. Do you want to show your crazy friend your magic trick?""

I hesitate a bit, checking the door. If I'm caught playing with fire again, they'd have an excuse to send me back to an isolated room, with the handcuffs and all that crap. They even put two fire extinguishers inside my bedroom, which is rather funny, I think.

Kelsi is waiting, looking a bit excited. Gosh, if it wasn't for her, it'd go insane locked up here. .. I take a deep breath, and lift my hand. One by one, I light a little flame on top of each finger. It's like I'm growing nails, and the flame is strangely redder than a normal fire, almost pinkish. My friend bites her lower lip.

""Damn, if only one of us was smoking, that would be so cool. It really doesn't hurt?""

""Not at all. It almost feels a bit cold, actually.""

""Well, your watch isn't beeping like crazy like last time, so...""

""Mara!""

Kelsi and I jump, and I immediately make my fire disappear. At the entrance of my bedroom, the young nurse is staring at us, her hands on her hips.

""Are you crazy, you know you can't do that in here!""

""Sorry, Bonnie,"" I mutter.

Thankfully, it's only Bonnie. She's probably the only nurse on this floor who won't freak out with only this much. She sighs and comes in with a large tray, my breakfast.

""You're lucky it's just me... Everyone is scared that you'd do that again. Everything okay here?"" She asks, putting it down on the little table.

""Still itchy from the bandages...""

She walks up to the bed, and checks my legs mostly, where the large burns are hidden under those damn bandages and layers of cream. I think Bonnie is the only nurse I like. She's just a bit older than us, petite, and very gentle. Her red hair is put in a high ponytail today, and she's rather cute with her freckles.

Kelsi grabs the coffee from my tray while Bonnie is not looking, busy checking my temperature, and sips it down. She makes a little victory sign behind the nurse's back.

""Kelsi, put that down, it's not for you,"" suddenly says Bonnie, still not looking.

I scoff, amused. Kelsi's jaw drops.

""How do you know I took it!""

""If you open the lid, it smells. I'm a werewolf, I can tell.""

I always forget Bonnie is a werewolf. She looks like any normal human being, except maybe for that strange glow in her green eyes sometimes. Also, she never needs to turn on the lights at night, and her sense of smell is very good... Good enough to tell when Kelsi tries to get free food from the Hospital.

""Damn, I wish I was a werewolf,"" sighs Kelsi. ""It must be so nice to get to shapeshift into a wolf anytime and get around naked.""

""That's a bit weird to think about,"" I say, amused.

""First, we are not naked since we have our fur, and actually, it's a real pain to take off your clothes and put them back on, when you don't rip it,"" replies Bonnie.

""Bonnie, any news of when I can go out?"" I ask, a bit more seriously.

She hesitates a bit before answering, crossing her arms.

""Well, medically speaking, you're doing very well. Your skin is recovering from your burn marks very fast, which shouldn't even be possible with third and four-degree burns for a normal human or a werewolf.""

""That's our little witch doing wonders..."" whispers Kelsi with a smile.

Bonnie nods.

""We don't know much about witches, so, we can only observe, but yes, you're doing fine on that part. The problem is your amnesia. We have done every CT scan, MRI, or check-up we could, and there's nothing that could explain it. You apparently didn't hurt your head in the accident, so the underlying cause is still totally unknown. We think it's psychological. To be honest, even if your doctor says yes, your psychiatrist will probably refuse, saying you're still mentally unstable...""

""Oh yes, she's obviously some dangerous psychopath,"" mutters Kelsi, rolling her eyes.

I frown. I'm so fed up with that guy.

""I am stable, Bonnie,"" I protest. ""I've been locked up here for weeks, and I only get to take a walk outside once in a while. I haven't lost control in a while, too. Seriously, I have enough, and my memory is not going to come back by having me locked up here either. Can't my older sister ignore that guy and have me out of here anyway?"" I ask.

""I don't think so, Mara,"" says Bonnie, looking a bit sorry; ""I think Ms. Garnett listens to all of your doctors.""

""When is my next time with him, then?"" I ask, unhappy.

""This afternoon...""

I nod. I'm so fed up. This time, this guy is going to have to agree to let me out of here, because I'm fed up. I need some real fresh air, not a walk around the hospital park once every two days like some dog! Bonnie doesn't say anything else, giving me worried glances, but Kelsi has a smirk on.

""Someone's fired up...""

Bonnie shakes her head.

""Mara, if you lose control again, you're going to be sent back to the isolation cell. You know that, right?""

""I know, but really, Bonnie, I'm done. That guy is signing my release form or whatever today.""

# #2 The other voice

I hear a polite knock on my door and take a deep breath. A quick glance at the bracelet, still beeping green. Alright.

""Hello, miss Garnett,"" he says with his usual polite smile, walking in.

""Hi.""

I stay on my bed, legs crossed, and I have a hard time not glaring at that guy. My psychiatrist is in his early forties, despite having lots of grey hair already, a wrinkled shirt, and a crooked nose. His name is Dimitri Epstein. Doctor Epstein... He takes the seat next to my bed, taking out his notepad as always. He does his best to look amiable, but I'm sure this is just part of his job. Not looking at the patient like she's a crazy witch... While he opens his ball pen, his eyes fall on the new envelope on my bedside table.

""I see your friend found some new pictures? Any luck?""

""No,"" I reply coldly.

I'm on my guard. I can't get mad, but I don't want him to refuse my release again.

""That's too bad... As I mentioned before, I am a bit concerned about this apparent lack of a social life before your accident, miss Garnett. As you know, your family is worried about what led to this unfortunate incident. Have you taken some time to think about that?

I frown. Right. The main reason, or excuse, for my family to lock me here is that I would be the one who burned that building down, in an attempt to kill myself. Thankfully, there was no other victim, but also no witnesses...

""I do have a friend,"" I note.

""Right, miss Kim,"" he nods. ""However, miss Kim herself said you two were not very close before that incident, didn't she? Despite her many attempts to befriend you, she said, and I quote, that you were not very talkative. Your relationship was that of simple flatmates, nothing else. I'm glad you're on better terms now, but this is not really helping us understand your behavior before the incident.""

""Those pictures show I went to a party,"" I reply, handing him the envelope.

Doctor Epstein opens it and takes his time to check each of the pictures with a little frown on.

""Interesting... Do you know when those pictures were taken, Clarissa?"" He asks, taking some notes on his notepad.

""...Before I met Kelsi,"" I admit. ""...and I told you to call me Mara!""

Damn it, I hate it when he calls me that on purpose! Epstein jumps, but quickly regains his composure and puts the envelope back, shaking his head.

""That is not your name. Your name is Clarissa Mary Garnett, as it's stated on all your official documents, and as your family confirmed. We have already been over this, you saw all those documents yourself, Clarissa. There is no girl called Mara. This Mara is only a persona, a self-defense mechanism you have created yourself. It's nothing to be afraid about, Clarissa, everyone has a different way to cope with a traumatic event.""

""I can create fire with my hands. Are you going to tell me my traumatized brain has invented this, too?"" I growl back.

He stays quiet, for a long minute.

""Alright. I understand you do not want to... dissociate yourself from Mara. However, if you are Mara, then what about Clarissa? After all, you are Clarissa. You have seen all the proofs of that. Your official documents, statements of your family, your friends, pictures... However, there is nothing about... Mara. No one knows her. So, who do you think Mara is?""

I don't have an answer to that. I just woke up, knowing my name. As if it was engraved deep in my head, like the only light I was able to hang on to. Everything else is gone. None of those documents or pictures they showed me reminded me of anything. I have an older sister that does look strikingly like me, but I couldn't recognize or remember her. Same with Kelsi, and she's the person I have been living with for months. Moreover, they all seemed to know me as Clarissa, not Mara.

Who the hell is Mara, then? Who am I...? I massage my temples, annoyed. So many questions and absolutely no answer. The only thing I'm sure of is that I won't be able to find it by being trapped here!

""Do you understand?"" Gently asks Dr. Epstein. ""The nurse who is taking care of you mentioned you want to leave the hospital, but Clarissa, I don't think you are ready.""

""I need to leave! You won't be able to achieve anything by keeping me trapped here!"" I yell, frustrated. ""I can read as many stupid cards you have, do as many tests, I don't care, it's meaningless! My memories are gone, and I have been in here for weeks, with no progress at all!""

""I don't think that's true,"" he says. ""First, your physical recovery was spectacular. I discussed it with your doctor earlier. He has never seen someone transferred out of the Burn Unit so fast with the injuries you had.""

I already know that. They call it a miracle, but I don't feel like so. My body knows what to do, and is healing itself better than any of their ointments or treatments. All of my deeper burns have now changed to lighter ones. Not only do I not feel any pain anymore, but the process isn't leaving any scar at all. My skin looks as new and smooth as a baby's. They even tried to get some samples to study, but it returned to be complete as burnt as charcoal the second it left me, which was even weirder.

I'm not burnt by my own fire, and my skin heals fast. So why would I have trapped myself inside of a fire?

""If I'm so fine, why no let me out?"" I say. ""I can even keep that stupid bracelet if it makes you feel better!""

I can't take it out by myself, and it tracks and records my body temperature at all times. According to Bonnie, that thing was custom-made for me. My personal thermometer tracker or something. It's sure better than the handcuffs, but it's not like it's invisible either. I feel like I'm a ticking bomb on a lock or a prisoner.

Dr Epstein makes a severe expression, takes a few more notes, and raises his head again to look at me.

""It's not that I don't want to allow you to leave, Clarissa. However, you have to understand that this isn't only about your security, but that of others as well. Since your admittance in the hospital, you've burned two beds, and injured several members of the staff as well. This isn't a trivial matter.""

""That was weeks ago,"" I protest. ""I haven't hurt anyone or burnt anything in weeks, I can control myself now. Bonnie can tell you, I won't injure someone again!""

He sighs, shaking his head.

""Clarissa, I think you appreciate miss Bonnie very much. Just like your friend Kelsi, you wouldn't hurt people who don't upset you. However, things are different for people who don't go by your demands. We both know you have been showing some anger management issues, and this is not giving me enough trust in your self-control.""

""When, then?"" I retort back. ""You can't keep me here forever just because you don't trust me! If you never let me experience the outside world, how would you know if I can control myself or not?""

He clicks his ballpen, one, two, three, four times. It's annoying, but I'm more annoyed at the fact that he's not answering me. I want to tell him to hurry up, but I need to keep my emotions in check. I'm already on edge, my hands feel hot. I know I can burst my flames out at any second. It's as if my fire is reacting to my anger. I could blast this annoying guy at any second, watch him burn down to ashes, walk out that door, and...

""Clarissa?""

I flinch.

""S-sorry,"" I mumble.

""You looked lost in your thoughts right now. Do you want to share with me what you were thinking about?""

Oh, that's not the kind of thing I can tell him. That my instincts are telling me to do whatever the hell I want, including getting rid of my psychiatrist by burning him like some toast and break out.

""Nothing,"" I lie.

He frowns a bit, pushing his pen against his lips.

""I've noticed you seem to have those short episodes of absences seizures regularly when you're with me. Does that happen often?""

""I'm not sure...""

It's the truth this time. I'm not even sure what those are supposed to be. It's almost as if I'm... someone else, for a few seconds. Like another voice taking over in my head. Where the heck does that come from? Every time, it's like someone else in my head, whispering... I close my eyes and take a deep breath.

""Clarissa, talk to me. How do you feel right now?""

""Frustrated. I have a hundred questions and no one is willing to give me the answers I want.""

""How about we list your questions down, then?""

I glare at him. Really? After weeks of being locked here, he thinks everything can be solved with some stupid chit-chat?

""I want to see my sister.""

""I know, but she is...""

""Busy, I get it.""

This is always the same damn answer. I have only seen my older sister three times since I woke up, and according to everyone here, it's a damn miracle. Kelsi didn't even know I had an older sister, I apparently never mentioned her. I never mentioned my family at all, and I apparently didn't bother to keep any pictures of them in my room. What kind of family is this?

No good family relationships, no friends... No one even knows what the heck I was doing at the University!

He lets out a long sigh and takes out his phone.

""Alright, I guess we won't get anywhere until I actually ask...""

""Put it on speaker.""

He looks at me, surprised. I want to listen to what my older sister says, why she won't come to see me. I'm tired of always hearing it from someone else. He nods and calls her. To my surprise, she answers after only two ringtones.

""Dr. Epstein? Something wrong with Clarissa?""

""N-no, miss Garnett, but... I'm with your younger sister, and she insists that she really wants to leave the Hospital. I was on one of my sessions with her, and Clarissa insisted that I call you personally.""

""I already said no.""

He and I exchange a glance. How can she answer so fast? She could at least consider it, or even ask how I'm doing recently! Why is she so bent on that fucking no? Dr. Epstein sighs, and looks a bit distressed, with me glaring at him.

""I think it might be better if you... gave a reason to miss Clarissa. She is a bit sensitive about her confinement, and...""

""I don't have any reason to give. She's my younger sister, I'm her legal tutor. I make decisions, Clarissa doesn't need to know why. Is that all? I'm busy.""

""I understand, ma...""

I grab the phone from his hand, furious. I don't give a damn about her being busy! This is my life we are talking about, she is not the one damn locked up between four walls!

""Tell me why you won't let me go out!"" I shout.

""C-Clarissa?"" Her voice is more high-pitched, she almost sounds like she's about to choke. ""Why are you listening to this...""

""Yes, I listened, and I want to know why you are not letting me out!""

I hear her sigh.

""You don't need to know. It's also for your security. As long as you stay in that hospital, you won't get in any trouble, and this way, you can be...""

""What security! You don't tell me anything! Amy, I can freaking make fire with my hands! What is there that I should be afraid of, what trouble?""

""Clarissa, enough! The Police already made us pay for all of the damages on that damn building, and I have three lawyers making sure no one sues you! Our people already think I have a crazy pyromaniac younger sister, and the damn werewolves all over me trying to get to you! This City is already complicated enough to deal with!""

""...The werewolves? Why are the werewolves wanting something to do with me...?""

""Clarissa, stop asking questions. You're staying where you are and that's final. We will discuss that when I come back to Silver City.""

""When is that?""

She sighs at the other end of the phone. Damn, I really feel like a freaking fly trying to squeeze into her agenda. I wait for her answer, a bit too long in my opinion.

""Give the phone back to Dr. Epstein.""

""I'm listening,"" he says.

""I said to take the phone back. If I need to ask again, you're fired.""

Oh, crap... I didn't mean for that guy to risk his job. Can my older sister even do that? Does she own that hospital or what? I let the poor man take back his phone, but I already know this is a lost battle. He apologizes non-stop for over a minute before hanging up with a sour face.

""She was a bit... upset,"" he says.

""Sorry about that.""

He shakes his head, putting his phone back and retrieving his things before getting up.

""Do not apologize, miss Clarissa. To be honest, I understand your position too. It's not easy to be locked up when you have done nothing wrong... By your own family, no less. Unfortunately, there isn't much I can do to help you. On the papers, you are here as a psychiatric patient, and this is the hardest one to overcome when it comes to leaving without your family's approval.""

""...Do you think my sister is lying?"" I ask.

He seems to hesitate for a few seconds, playing with the pen between his fingers. After a while, he shrugs.

""From the few exchanges I've had with her, all I can say is that your elder sister is probably more stubborn than you are, and very down to earth. However, I do think that the fact that she's the only one in your family who does call you and visit you says... a lot, about her character.""

His words confuse me even more. Does he mean to say Amy cares about me? Does she? What kind of older sister is that? I'm trapped here, she barely visits me... I don't get it.

""I'll get going, now, miss Clarissa, I think we are done for the day. Please try to be patient a little bit more, hm? I sincerely hope it will all be solved soon.""

I nod and watch him leave. As soon as he's gone, I let out a long sigh of frustration and lie down on my bed, with a grimace because I rubbed some of my bandages unwillingly. What the heck is wrong with my family... None of this makes sense. What was that about the werewolves, too? No one ever mentioned them aside from Bonnie until now. I push the button, but another nurse comes, much to my annoyance. Bonnie's shift is probably over... Crap. I wanted to ask her, see if she knows something. The old lady leaves my dinner there and almost runs out of the room. They all avoid me when I'm unhappy like that.

I stare outside. Another day lost, trapped here. Is Kelsi at her part-time job? I bite my nail, nervous and pissed. What do I do? If things go on like this, Amy will never let me out, or I'm going to go completely crazy before that happens. I should just walk out... I feel the shadow, crawling in the back of my mind. I should walk out that door, follow my instincts, and leave. Burn anything and anyone who tries to stop me. I should just end this...

Suddenly, I hear some sounds, coming from the outside. What the heck? I run to the window, unsure. I don't see anything, but I can hear someone yelling, a woman screaming. It looks like it's coming from below the hospital, in the park.

Something's wrong. Why is no one coming to her help? The few silhouettes I can see don't seem bothered at all, what's wrong with those people! I run out of my bedroom. I hear someone yelling, trying to have me come back, but I ignore them. I dodge whoever tried to hold me back. I'm almost flying. It's strange, I can hear that woman's screams even from inside the corridor. I run down the stairs, trying to find the way out. A couple of senile grannies stare at me in confusion, I have to squeeze in between them to get out. Two furious nurses are behind me, running after me, but I don't care, that woman needs help!

I finally find the way out, to the park. I've been there a few times, so why the heck does this seem so far! I jump past the door, to find myself in the park. The... empty park. I look around, completely at a loss.

There is no woman, and no screams anymore. It can' t be... I just heard them. It was so clear! How come I don't see anyone? There's only an ambulance at the other end, with a red-haired guy smoking his cigarette, who starts walking up to me with a worried look. Crap, what the heck... What the...

I've been trying to find a short sci-fi story a teacher read in school for years, with no luck. It is not anything Ray Bradbury, but had the cadence/style of a sci-fi story written in his era.

The premise is a man having called five(maybe four?) humans to a meeting room along with his butler, thinking he has caught an alien saboteur. They sit around a table and the room is lit with four or five candles.

They're on another planet, maybe Mars. I think there had been animosity between the humans and aliens, but a truce was in place. The man talks about a school bus that had exploded prior, perhaps years ago, full of school teachers, and that it had been done by an alien. I can't remember if this was known, or if he had figured it out.

The man goes on to explain the aliens can disguise themselves, but he found out that by injecting a certain chemical into them, their eyes glow in the dark. He tested this on an alien corpse, which one of the suspects states isn't allowed by the truce (or something). 

The human goes on to say that he's put the chemical in the coffee they've been drinking, and that he's an excellent shot; he has a gun and is going to shoot out the flames one by one, using the last bullet to shoot the person whose eyes are glowing. 

After shooting all the candles, he is shocked to see all their eyes glowing, and he cries for his butler to help. The butler says the wham line, which is something like ""I cannot, for my eyes, too, glow in the dark,"" revealing that even he was an alien all along. I believe it ends there

What am I missing?","I've had elevated Serum ALT and pain in my liver since November, and the GP thinks I probably have NAFLD, pending an ultrasound. No formal diagnosis yet, but it's probable at this point.

So what do I do about it, lifestyle-wise? My current status, without changing any habits: 

- BMI 21.6 (never higher than 23.8 over the last year)
- go to the gym 4-5 times a week
- barely drink alcohol (last I had was Easter, and before that was in early March)
- have roughly weekly ""sugar evenings"" where I might have around 50-100g of sweets. Otherwise max of 20g dark chocolate every few days, maybe less
- stopped drinking unsweetened black coffee in November, now back to 1-2 cups a day


From what my Google fu tells me, this is 3/4 of the things you can do to improve NAFLD, and I still probably have it, with a symptom of nagging liver pain some days. 

What else is there to do, beyond cutting out sugar entirely and maybe going keto (currently considering, need to speak to a GP after any formal diagnosis)?

Edit: some test results, as they were asked for:

Serum ALT:

- 75 (5th November '24)
- 72 (22nd November '24)
- 117 (9th April)

1knuncr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1knuncr/a_bitter_taste/,A bitter taste,"I woke up with a bitter taste in my mouth. Not coffee-bitter—sharper than that. I reached for the water on the nightstand.

“Ow!” a woman said as I accidentally smacked her in the head mid-swipe.

My eyes snapped open.

A woman was in bed with me. Older than me—at least ten years. How the hell did she end up here?

Wait… where is here?

The bed was a king-sized monster with a plush mattress topper, silky comforter, and a fortress of pillows. There was a nightstand on either side.

This wasn’t my bed. Mine was a sad twin with the same sheets I’d had since moving out of my parents’ place.

I sat up fast. The woman was watching me, rubbing her head.

“Are you alright, honey?” she asked.

“H-honey? I’m your honey?” I said, inching toward the edge of the bed. My foot touched the floor, and I flinched—it was stone. Cold stone.

I finally looked around. The room had cobblestone walls, floors, and ceiling. Light came from a tall, barred window. The whole place felt like a castle.

“Alan, are you feeling okay? I know we had a fight last night, but—”

“Where am I?” I interrupted, heart pounding. How did I get here? What even was last night?

I remembered drinks with Rob. Was that yesterday?

“You’re home, dear. In our bedroom,” she said softly.

“Home? Our bedroom? I… I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

I stood up, shielding myself and scanning for clothes.

“What are you looking for?” she asked, rising from the bed. She was also naked. I turned away quickly.

“Clothes. My clothes. Any clothes.”

“They’re in the wardrobe, dear,” she said, gesturing to a tall dresser beside a vanity cluttered with makeup.

I opened it. The clothes inside looked like something from a period drama. Velvet, high collars, weird buttons.

“Whose are these?” I asked, not turning around.

“Yours, honey!” she said. “Seriously, are you okay? Do I need to call the doctor?”

I pulled on a pair of trousers that fit disturbingly well.

“Ma’am… what year is it?” I asked, staring at the wall.

“Alan. You’re really starting to scare me. Let’s go get some breakfast, alright?”

“What year is it?!” I shouted, turning on her. “Am I in the past? Is this a joke? Why am I in a castle? What’s with these clothes?”

“Y-you said you always wanted to live in a castle,” she stammered. “You picked out all those clothes yourself.”

That… sounded like me.

I looked down at the suit. Midnight blue, double-breasted, a silver chain across the vest. It looked expensive. Regal. Something I would’ve drooled over in a fantasy artbook when I was a kid.

I turned to the mirror, curious to see how I looked in it.

For a second, I was impressed. The suit fit perfectly, the cut made me look taller, stronger.

But then I really looked at the face.

It wasn’t nineteen anymore.

My jawline was sharper. There was faint stubble, like I hadn’t shaved in a few days. My eyes looked... heavier somehow. Tired.

I looked like someone who’d seen things. Someone who'd lived a little too much life.

You're staring at your untouched GMAT study plan, feeling that familiar pang of guilt. Despite your best intentions to complete 8 hours of weekend study, you've barely managed 2. Sound familiar?

You're not alone. Our tracking data from over 5,000 GMAT students shows a striking pattern: **while majority of students meet their weekday study targets, only 31% fulfil their weekend study goals**. Yet weekends represent nearly half the available study time for working professionals – making this disconnect the silent score-killer most test-takers never address.

This pattern repeats across industries and backgrounds: consistent Monday-Thursday study followed by weekend plans that rarely materialize. For the average GMAT aspirant, this translates to approximately 8 lost study hours each weekend. Over a six-week period, that's 48 hours – equivalent to nearly two full weeks of weekday studying completely vanishing.

The weekend study trap is perhaps the most overlooked aspect of GMAT preparation. Let's dive into why weekend study falls apart, what it's really costing you, and how to reclaim these critical hours.

# Why Weekend Study Falls Apart

https://preview.redd.it/jy05kw1fd31f1.png?width=703&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c9bb280f3a5b0d6c90147e67936d90f88e2ff04

The collapse of weekend study plans isn't about motivation or discipline – it's about structure. Here's why your weekend plans consistently unravel:

**The structural void**

During weekdays, your work schedule creates natural boundaries and transition periods. You study before work, during lunch, or after office hours. Weekends lack these guardrails, leaving study time vulnerable to expansion or contraction based on how you feel in the moment.

**Social gravity**

Friends asking to meet for brunch, family expecting your presence, household chores piling up – weekends are social by design. These social pressures create what psychologists call ""approach-avoidance conflict,"" where competing goals fight for your attention.

**Biological rhythm disruption**

Many students dramatically alter their sleep schedule on weekends – sleeping in 2-3 hours later than weekdays. This creates a mini ""jet lag"" effect that impacts cognitive performance. Your brain literally struggles to engage with complex material at the same level.

**The recovery mindset**

After a demanding work week, it's psychologically natural to frame weekends as ""recovery time."" This mindset is fundamentally at odds with intensive study, creating internal resistance even before you open your first practice question.

The result? You enter Monday having lost momentum, feeling guilty, and facing an uphill battle to restart your study rhythm.

# The Real Cost of Weekend Study Failure

The impact of inconsistent weekend study goes beyond lost hours. Our data reveals a striking pattern:

Students who maintain consistent weekend study (at least 75% of planned hours) score 70-90 points higher on average than those with similar weekday consistency but poor weekend execution.

https://preview.redd.it/z3xh6yjnd31f1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=fede438123b1ef6f0adf9153e3ab57b9bb1af09b

This substantial difference stems from three key factors:

**Momentum reset:**

 Neurologically, your brain optimizes for whatever you do consistently. Each weekend gap forces your brain to ""reload"" GMAT pathways on Monday, wasting valuable mental energy.

**Cumulative hour loss:**

Over a typical 3-month study period, inconsistent weekend study costs you approximately 75-90 hours – equivalent to an entire month of preparation.

**Quality degradation:**

Sporadic study leads to more review time needed to reconnect with material, reducing the quality of your study hours.

One student, Priya, who had a traveling marketing role, capitalized on her weekends and reached a brilliant 725 on her first GMAT attempt. It did not come easy! After a long week of work, she was finding it difficult to take time out for GMAT prep over the weekend: ""I realized my weekend study failure wasn't just about lost hours – it was erasing progress I'd made during the week. The breakthrough came when I started treating my weekend study hours with the same non-negotiable approach I give to client meetings.""

# Creating Weekend Structure That Works

The solution isn't working harder or feeling more guilty – it's creating a weekend structure that aligns with reality.

https://preview.redd.it/fzppusu3e31f1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=c654c2376aa3231db0bcda759864a505cc6fc971

**Maintain consistent sleep anchors**

Even if you sleep longer on weekends, keep your wake time within 60 minutes of your weekday schedule. This small adjustment prevents the ""weekend jet lag"" that derails cognitive performance.

**Front-load study sessions**

The most successful GMAT students complete their weekend study before noon. Morning hours offer fewer distractions and higher willpower reserves. Try the ""First 3 Hours"" rule – don't engage with any non-GMAT activity (including checking your phone) for the first three hours after waking up on weekend days.

**Create and clearly communicate your weekend schedule**

Unlike weekdays where your absence is expected during work hours, weekends require explicit boundary-setting. Create a weekend schedule and clearly communicate it to family/roommates/friends. When everyone understands your study blocks, you'll face fewer interruptions and requests during dedicated study time.

This communication step is critical – many students skip it, assuming others should automatically respect their study time. As one student noted: ""The game-changer was when I actually sat down with my family and shared my weekend schedule. Instead of constant interruptions followed by my growing frustration, they now know exactly when I'm available and when I'm not.""

**Schedule pre-emptive breaks**

One reason weekend study plans collapse is the ""all or nothing"" mindset. Instead, schedule deliberate 45-minute breaks between study sessions. These pre-emptive breaks reduce psychological resistance and make the study blocks feel more manageable.

**Implement the ""specific location"" technique**

Designate a weekend-specific study location different from your weekday spot. This creates a physical anchor for your weekend study routine. As one successful student noted: ""My weekend coffee shop became as mentally linked to GMAT as my office desk is to work.""

# Balancing Study with Life

While structure is essential, completely sacrificing your social life for months isn't sustainable. Here's how to maintain balance:

https://preview.redd.it/dswlyco8e31f1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee9175a5d62969a05a4c732d6496490f6fa6b819

**The social container approach**

Instead of reactively responding to weekend invitations, proactively create a ""social container"" – a specific time block designated for social activities. For many successful students, this means reserving Saturday evening/night while protecting Saturday morning and Sunday for study.

**The strategic compromise**

Absolute rigidity leads to rebellion. When important social events arise, don't abandon your study plan – modify it. If a friend's birthday falls on your scheduled study day, wake up 2 hours earlier to complete a condensed session before the event.

**Use visualization for motivation**

Before each weekend, visualize Monday morning. Imagine two scenarios: starting Monday having completed your weekend goals versus starting with regret. This mental contrast technique, researched by psychologist Gabriele Oettingen, significantly improves follow-through.

**Leverage accountability tools**

Technology can provide the external structure weekends lack. Study streak tools like e-GMAT's Study Rings create visual accountability, making the consequences of missed weekend study immediately visible.

# Parting Thoughts:

Your competitors for those coveted MBA seats aren't just fighting you on content mastery – they're fighting you on consistency. The irony is that weekend study mastery can be your secret weapon specifically because it's where most students fail.

Consider this: If you improve your weekend study execution from the average 31% to even 70%, you're potentially giving yourself a 70–90-point advantage over competitors with similar aptitude and weekday discipline.

Start this weekend. Choose just one technique from this article – whether it's maintaining a consistent wake time, implementing the ""First 3 Hours"" rule, or creating a visual weekend timetable. Small, consistent changes to your weekend approach will compound into significant score improvements over your preparation journey.

For years I’ve experimented, stayed consistent, and yet still no progress. Even tried the bc pill. Then switched to nexolanon when it didn’t do much. Going to switch back, but I recently also cut dairy, nicotine, and coffee to see if that helps. 

My recent previous skin routine:
Morning:
-the Ordinary Glucoside cleanser
-the Ordinary moisturizer 
- the Ordinary salicylic acid
-the Ordinary niacinamide + zinc
-the Ordinary marula oil

Night:
-remove makeup with ponds
-the ordinary cleanser + moisturizer + SA serum + n&z solution
-the Ordinary rose hip oil

Even tho I’m using clean gentle products, maybe I’m still doing too much. Entirely too much. Maybe it’s skincare products all together that’s causing my acne. Mind you, I’m almost 21. Started having acne when I was 11-12 or so. It’s been a decade. I’ve expected my hormones to regulate a tad by now. So I feel like if the products were gonna work, they would have by now. With that being said, I put all my skincare into my bathroom drawer. So here’s what I’m going to try. Let me know what you think. 

Morning:
-wash with water (I always always wash my hands thoroughly before I wash my face)
-Vaseline (I got a brand new container just for my face and I use a clean qtip, straight from the pack to dip and apply to avoid contaminating the jar)
-blue lizard spf 50 sunscreen stick
-hydrocortisone cream only on days I pick bad and have awful redness. I try not to use often tho bc of the steroid dependency. 

Night:
-if I’m just wearing mascara, remove with water (I don’t use waterproof), if full face, ponds cold cream. 
-double cleanse. Dial antibacterial gold bar (every 2-3 days), and then the ordinary face wash (cleanse 2x with this on the days I don’t use dial)
-hydrocolloid patches on picked/popped acne, hydrocolloid oval bandages on areas I’ve picked to an open wound. 
-Vaseline 

Trying to keep it as simple as possible. Anything I use is always fragrance free, and I wash my sheets and pillow cases once a week. I wash my face and body after washing and conditioning my hair, and try very hard not to touch my face. And if I must, I always use hand sanitizer beforehand.

A diamond is a chunk of coal that did well under pressure. – Henry Kissinger\*

Helen knew that it was over. Long before her husband had said it was. She knew about the other women. And his other children.

She wasn’t an idiot. When the kids were younger, she just pretended everything was fine. As they got older, they knew it wasn’t. The youngest, JD, was now in his senior year and there was no hiding it.

Bob had moved out seven months ago. He called the kids on a regular basis but she didn’t know if they talked or not. It was not all his fault. She was not innocent in letting their marriage fall apart.

She didn’t have a lover and a second family stashed away. But she was just as guilty.

When they married twenty-four years ago, she was not small, but she wasn’t this big either. Three kids, thyroid issues and low self esteem added a hundred pounds.

Or more.

The alarm across the hall went off letting her know that JD was awake. It was Wednesday which meant he had a weekly run with the other Navy recruits. She heard him go through his morning routine and then his keys jingled as he left.

After Bob left, Helen could no longer keep up with the mortgage and had to sell the house. After paying off the mortgage, they split what was left, per the divorce decree and state law. Bob had put a down payment on a new house for his new family. Helen paid for her second hand car and she and JD moved into the two bedroom apartment.

With her weekly paycheck, she could pay her bills, feed herself and the bottomless pit of a teenage son and have enough leftover for her one indulgence.

Her nails.

The lady at the nail salon always saved her Saturday morning appointment for her. Saturday morning at 9:45, Helen would be sitting in the massage chair with her feet in the little tub. Bian would pick out a color and not let Helen see until everything was done. Nail art and everything.

The eighty dollars could be spent more wisely. But she enjoyed her time to herself. A little bit of pampering and she could face another week.

Rolling out of bed, she made her way to the only bathroom. That had been a big adjustment. But they were doing well now.

She did miss the big soaker tub. Stepping under the spray of the shower tub, she doubted that she would be able to get into this tub.

If she were honest, getting in would not be the problem. Getting out? That would probably require oil. And a crane. Possibly fire fighters.

Giggling at the thought, she wondered if she could get the hot fire fighters from TikTok.

She washed her hair and added the conditioner to set as she washed herself. Once she deemed herself clean, she rinsed her body and hair. Then she stepped out and used a beach towel to dry off.

JD had talked her into getting them when he found out that the complex had a pool. She was NOT going to the pool. Not in a swimsuit. Not in a cover-up. Not even in a circus tent. It was not happening.

But she liked the fact that she could wrap the towel around herself. Combing out her hair, she let it hang down her back to dry. Looking in the mirror, she saw herself and again didn’t blame Bob for leaving.

Five feet four inches and two hundred and sixty pounds. Mousy brown hair with traces of gray. Light brown eyes saw it all. Cheeks too round. Laugh lines and crows feet.

Flabby arms. Large gut. Thighs that not only touched, Helen often wondered if she were part mermaid. Yeah, she could definitely be mistaken for a mermaid. Or at least a manatee.

She finished her make-up and blow dried her hair before going and getting dressed. It was early August and she was already hot this early in the morning. Just add tht to one more reason for Bob leaving. Menopause, although her doctor called it perimenopause. She didn't see that there was a difference.

The dress that she chose was a golden brown and had multi colored fall leaves on it. Simple gold hoop earrings and the bracelet her kids gave her were the only jewelry that she wore. It had been over six months since she took off her wedding band, she still wasn’t used to not wearing a ring.

Grabbing a jacket and her lunch from the fridge, Helen walked out into the morning light and began her thirty minutes bus commute to the office she had worked at since she her marriage ended.

The new owners of the building she worked at would be there today. At least they weren’t getting rid of her receptionist position.

Yet.

She knew that one of the lawyers in one of the firms wanted her gone. The woman constantly complained about the fat receptionist that could be replaced by a security guard. Or a kiosk.

As if Helen didn’t know that she was fat, the woman who ran marathons on the weekend liked to let her know.

She really wanted to tell the woman off. Helen always had a smart reply, which never got said.

""I have a mirror, yes, I see how fat I am.""

""Really? Oh my God! Is that why I have to buy a size 2X?""

""I'm so glad you told me. I've only had this body for forty-three years, I never knew I was fat.""

""That’s because I have more personality than you. I keep it tucked between my fat rolls.""

Helen often wondered what the woman's reaction would be if she said anything. But she liked her job. Even more, she liked the benefits of her job. You know, the ones like being able to pay rent. So her comments stayed in her mind behind her smile. While hoping and praying that her tears did not fall.

Arriving at the building, Helen set up the three coffee bars in the large lobby. The blinds were opened slightly to allow the morning light in. Then she settled into her desk and opened up her computer.

Twenty minutes after eight, she was called into the building supervisors office. Smiling nervously she sat in the chair he indicated.

“Helen, I want you to know that most everybody here is upset over this. The owners are doing away with your position. But one of the offices upstairs would like to speak with you.”

# Chapter 2: Sunday

*Don’t pray for an easy life, pray for the strength to endure a difficult one. – Bruce Lee*

Hank loved Sundays and hated them at the same time. He liked Jolene’s family, but really did not understand the weekly gatherings. Thankfully, there were not a lot of them. He was especially thankful since they were having lunch here at their one bedroom apartment.

The phone next to the bed chirped and Hank reached over to grab it. There was a message from his patrol partner.

‘Hey, shithead. Season starts today! Cookout at my place.’

Hank grinned at the phone and would love to be hanging out with the guys from the department. But, it was Sunday and Jolene was important to him.

And if he really wanted to move up in the department, she was important for his career.

‘Can’t. Jolene.’

He watched the little dots expecting some comment about him being whopped. Parker did not disappoint.

‘Ask the warden for a day pass. Or bring her with you.’

Just as Hank was going to respond, another message popped up.

‘Tori is excited for Jolene to come over’

Groaning, he texted back. ‘Her family is coming over for lunch. Our turn to host Sunday dinner’

‘Next week?’

‘We’re on shift dumbass'

The three dots blinked and then stopped. Started up again. Stopped. He was about to give up when a new message came through.

‘You and Tori. Damn. I’m not a dumbass. I’m a sexy dumbass.’

‘Sexy or not. Your still a dumbass.’

‘I know that should have been you’re and not your. Who’s the dumbass now?’

Hank chuckled as he put the phone back on the night stand.

The smell of chocolate cake drifted into the room and had him crawling out of bed. He loved her chocolate cake. It was a box mix, but she did something to it that made it awesome.

Of course, her mother was fat. Obviously, the woman could cook. How else would she get so damned fat. Hank knew he had to watch Jolene to make sure she didn’t end up fat like Helen.

Hoping that it was just them there, Hank walked through the apartment in his black plaid boxers. He ran a hand over his shaved head and slid up behind Jolene in the kitchen.

She had dark brown hair and light brown eyes that complimented her lightly tanned skin. Her five feet five inch frame was plump without being fat and fit well with his five feet eleven. His toned arms wrapped around her waist as she was reading the recipe.

He could already tell that she was not wearing a bra. Kissing her neck, he slid his hands under her shirt and caressed her breasts. Jolene giggled as she leaned back into his chest.

“How long do we have?” Hank murmured.

“About ten minutes until I need to pull it back out.”

“Perfect.” He said picking her up holding her back to his chest. With no effort, he carried her to the bedroom. “On your knees.” He ordered setting her on her feet.

This used to be one of her favorite positions. Back when they first got together, he would tease her and drive her crazy until her legs were ready to give out.

The thought of it caused her to start to become wet. The way he would tease her clit with his tongue and her tits with his fingers. Then he would finger fuck her until she would cream all over his hand.

But recently, it had become his quickest way of getting off. He undid her jeans and pulled them down just as far as he needed. Then he was sliding into her and groaning in pleasure.

“I love it when you’re tight like this.”

Jolene groaned in pain and he must have taken it as one of pleasure because he began pounding in and out of her. She gasped at the pain she was feeling and he tightened his grip on her hips. Then he slammed into her, releasing his seed.

“I’m going to go get a shower.” Hank said pulling out.

Jolene waited until the shower started before she let out a small sob. He was a good guy, even if he wasn’t as attentive as he once had been. Maybe this was what happened after a year of marriage.

Using a towel hanging on the back of the door, she cleaned herself. In the painful process, she noticed a light streak of blood.

Her mom, Helen, noticed something was off, but what could she say? Her mom had stayed with a man who cheated on her through out their entire marriage. They had been divorced for less than six months. Her dad was remarried. Her mom was slipping further into depression.

Was this what she had to look forward to? A loveless marriage with an unfaithful husband?

Jolene was in bed scrolling through TikTok thinking about this when Hank came in. He took her phone and laid it on the charging pad. Then he slowly and thoroughly made love to her.

As her alarm went off on Monday morning, her fears had been pushed aside. Her concerns dismissed.

It’s how I show love and it comes naturally to me. Even when I don’t have much, I still find ways to make the people I care about feel special. I’m unemployed right now, but that hasn’t stopped me from putting effort, thought, and whatever money I can spare into meaningful gifts for my boyfriend (29M). He knows this about me and he definitely enjoys receiving. But what hurts is that he never really gives back in the same way. Not even close.

I don’t expect expensive things. I don’t need grand gestures. I just want to feel like he thinks about me the way I think about him and that he notices the little things, that he cares enough to try. But I’m starting to feel like I’m the only one in this relationship who actually goes out of my way to make the other person feel seen.

We’re long distance, so I try to close that gap with effort. Whether that’s sending gifts for special occasions (or no occasion at all), styling him, shopping for him, remembering everything he says he likes or wants and I love doing those things. But the lack of reciprocity is starting to feel less like a difference in love languages and more like he just doesn’t care as much.

There was one visit where we spent six hours shopping for him I helped him pick out all his clothes like I always do. And the whole time, he didn’t once ask me if I wanted or needed anything. This was right before my graduation, which he knew meant a lot to me, and he’d promised to get me something for it. He never did.

For Christmas, I gave him designer shoes, new clothes, and covered his annual gym membership. He said he’d give me my gift the weekend after the holidays and then gave me a bottle of perfume that I had literally bought for myself in front of him. He had a full week to come up with something thoughtful, and still gave me something I neither needed nor wanted.

Valentine’s Day? I shipped him a coffee machine in advance so it would arrive in time. It ended up making it there a day early. So he definitely knew that it was for valentines. He had an extra day to plan something or arrange to send me something. He gave me nothing. Not even flowers, something I’ve told him multiple times would mean a lot to me. And anytime I bring it up, he makes me feel like I’m being materialistic for wanting “stupid things.” I can’t even remember if he texted me saying happy valentines 

For his birthday, I booked a weekend getaway, decorated the hotel, paid for everything, and spoiled him the whole time. For mine? I said I just wanted to spend the day together. He planned a double date with his friend and his friend’s girlfriend even after I asked multiple times for it to just be us.

I’m not looking to keep score. But when someone knows exactly how much effort you put in and they still choose to do the bare minimum, it just starts to feel really lonely. Like I’m constantly pouring into someone who doesn’t even try to refill the cup.

I don’t know. I’m just feeling kind of hollow about it lately. Has anyone else gone through something like this? Am I the problem?

1knu9v3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSleep/comments/1knu9v3/dont_stress_about_darkrai_its_almost_useless_as_a/,Don't stress about Darkrai – it's almost useless as a Pokémon (from a min-max perspective),"Looking at the subreddit, I see many people are very frustrated with bad RNG when it comes to Darkrai. But there's no need to worry—even with the best RNG, Darkrai is still borderline useless.

If you're not focused on min-maxing and just want to use your favorite Pokémon, then go ahead! In that case, random skills don’t matter much, so there's no point in worrying about them.

However, if min-maxing and reaching Master 20 is your goal, then you should absolutely forget about Darkrai.

* **Skill setup:** Not viable. Darkrai has one of the lowest skill trigger chances in the game (around 2.3%). Even if it has two skill triggers, a skill-trigger-boosting nature, and max-ranked skills, it still falls thousands of points behind an average charger like Espeon or Ampharos. On top of that, it reduces the team’s energy, making it completely useless.
* **Ingredient setup:** Due to randomness, it's very difficult to get an AAA spread, and even if you do, Darkrai gets a reduced amount of ingredients. That means a basic AAX Pokémon is much better. Because of this, Darkrai requires additional ingredient Pokémon, taking up a slot in your team that could be used by a berry finder, ultimately reducing your weekly strength.
* **Berry setup:** This is the only potentially viable setup, but it’s still not great. Even if you randomly roll Berry Finding S and Helping Speed or Helping Bonus, you’ll still have a Pokémon that’s hard to level up, difficult to farm candies for, and requires tons of XP. Berry Pokémon rely heavily on their level, and it’s much easier to find and train a Houndoom, which reaches high levels much faster.

Darkrai's only advantage is the total strength it provides by contributing to berry, ingredient, and skill bonuses simultaneously. It *might* be worth keeping in your team for min-maxing *if* it has Helping bonus, Helping Speed M, Berry Finding S, and good ingredients (like coffee). But even then, it’s highly niche, and by the numbers, there are much better options available.",37,1747377529.0,PokemonSleep,18,0.88,False

Narcissist mother, pervert molester dad.

Now nobody protected me. My Narcissist mom is constantly sick and ill due to her own lack of self care. eg, never lifted a finger for housework, exercise or eating healthy. She is a healthy adult but she chose to just sit and rot at home in front of the tv snacking. I recalled being ordered around like her maid, runner & butler. Fetch her water, bring her phone, bring her handbag, switch on this and that, tend the laundry, wash the dishes, wipe the table, etc as a young fking child while my brothers (the sons) are upstairs playing video games. The coffee table is just inches away next to her and I am to lift up from the couch and walk across her to get her the cup and lift it up and turn my body sideaways to land on her open palm fingers (claws). This is why her kneecap and muscle on her legs deteriorated. (Muscular dystrophy)

I will never take care of her for her knee surgery. Mind you, she is planning one soon. I feel like moving out and cut ties from these asian parents. I owe them nothing. These asian principles that tied to spiritual about how God and Hell will burn children who are not filial piety. I have tons of internal one sided fight against these entities saying ""Am i supposed to care for them?"" ""The man who I call dad swho touched my breasts and fondled them, who molested me, and who had potentially sexual assault me when I was a child/toddler?"" I was a virgin (during then) but i recall i had been raped, like i had a feeling i was touched before. And i dared God to tell me if it happened when i was a young child/toddler.

I think God should know what a narcissist abuse is. All forms from physical to verbal to emotional to financial and even to spiritual. Not unless these entities they worshipped in the altar is the same of a narcissist and pervert as they are, that They do not see it wrong, then it shall be my fault to go to hell cause I am not ""filial piety"" enough.

I have no plan, nor heart nor anything to want to take care of them as they aged now. I still give allowances and paying those shitty bills and debts they so irresponsibly collected. In my heart, I just want to cut ties because they are just a burden to me at this point. The abuse sometimes relapsed and retriggered. I wish hell has a special place for people who do not take care of themselves or love themselves because at this point, i can take it to fight God and said, now because I prioritized self love and self protection, hence I left this set of toxic parents. 

if you come from where i come from, we can engage with psychics or master to channel and speak about our future from these services. I once was curious and naive, and afterall that had happened, do you know what these entities message is? Did your mother cook for you? Was that enough? Well, my mom don't cook lavishly or splendidly, boiled vegetables and rice cooker and steam this and that, sure. So, does it cancel off and excuses her brhaviour and action? I'd rather eat out, than to deal with all the abuse. I don't find it as an equal barter trade. I walked out of this fking religion.

Don't get me started about the ancestor culture, when i passed by, i occassionally think out loud in my head and said, congratulations, you just birthed a rapist and an abuser and had them as a children and a failure. You failed to protect me and i do not know you. I am cut off from this family tree.

I'm failing at everything and nobody cares, nobody wants to help, nobody wants to check in, nobody asks me to grab a coffee. 

I couldn't even lay it all out here and still maintain an audience but if I had to give a synopsis I would start with this year. I lived through an active shooting. My grandfather went on hospice. I moved. I stopped sleeping. I lost 30 lbs. I had a botched chiropractor appointment that caused an intense flair up of a genetic condition that's now causing daily, immobilizing pain. My small business is floundering. My partner talks about me to my friends, and not in a flattering way. I deserve some of the heat but I'm struggling and nobody cares. 

Full admittance that I'm a lot lately. My mood can turn on a dime. I usually feel somewhat helpless, other times I feel like a cheerleader for my nasty attitude. I crave attention. I don't go far enough to get any. I cry, a lot. I want to die but I'm scared to die. 

Per my genetic condition, the ""fix"" would be surgery. Surgery would fix my pain, fix my mood swings, fix my friendships? I can't see how surgery would make me less insufferable.

I closed my eyes as the obstacle ahead of me got closer and closer. But the next second, a lovely angel face appeared in my mind and my sanity pulled back. I couldn't die! I couldn't leave Millie alone in the world.





As my car was about to hit the bridge pillar, I opened my eyes and quickly swerved into the left lane, perfectly avoiding the pillar that might take my life. It was Taylor's mistake, I shouldn't be so foolish as to punish myself with death.





I stopped the car at the familiar villa,""My complexion returned to normal. I couldn't let my daughter know her father was a scumbag. Taylor was also convinced I would do that.""，Yes, I did,。

I opened the door, and there were only nanny Maria and my daughter's shoes in the hallway, which meant that Tyler hadn't come back tonight. I breathed a sigh. I always liked to track his movements more than before, and now his absence is the best reward for me.





""Serena, your husband's not home yet."" Maria came over and confirmed my guess. I nodded and said I knew.





""Where's Millie?"" I changed my shoes and looked into my daughter's room.

""Maria, you can get off work, thank you for taking care of Millie."" I don't want to explain more about Tyler, there is no point in showing the wound to others, the important thing is that I have become numb to it.





Now, I just want to lie on the big bed, I think I'm really tired.





Before lying down, I went to Millie's room, looked at her sleeping face, and kissed her forehead. My inner happiness began to rise again, and my brows began to stretch unconsciously. I'm glad I beat the darkness once again. No matter how bad my marriage with Tyler was, Millie was my greatest gift. She's the reason that made me strong.

I used to believe marrying the man of your dreams would be bliss, but the cruel reality taught me that you can't force love. I don't know how much longer I can hold out, but I'll do my best for Millie.





I buried my head under the covers letting sleep capture me. There was still a lot of work awaiting me. I needed to let go of the needless jealousy and sadness and then focus on the ones that were worth it.





However, feather kisses on my shoulders woke me up at exactly 4 AM. I groaned and rolled on the bed. The shameless lips that disturbed my comfortable sleep went to my neck. I opened my eyes and angrily pushed Tyler. His eyes immediately mirrored the anger that ignited between us.





“Wqhat LtJh$e…J”V





I shot him cold glares. “I’m exhausted, Tyler!”





He sat on the bed and hissed. “That’s always your reason!”





“Because it’s the truth. I worked all day until midnight. Do you expect me to stay awake and wait for you so you can quench your fcking thirst? No way! never! I'm not any of your bitches who crave your shameless c\*ck!”

My heart broke again, even though I explained to him that it was just an accident six years ago, he never believed me. I shook my head, there was no need to explain anymore.





I didn't want to face that face that hurt my heart anymore, I got out of bed to leave, but he grabbed me back onto the bed and quickly straddled me.





""Let me go!"" I angrily slapped his arms.

""You disgust me, Taylor. Do you really think I'll sleep with you after you've slept with different women? Go to hell! I'm not your sex toy!"" I immediately pushed him away!





He walked closer to her, gritting his teeth, ""Selena, have you forgotten who put us in this situation?""





""You framed me, got pregnant with my child, you manipulated me, so don't tell me this, you're no different from the women I've slept with. Your parents died, you lost everything, so you plotted a one-night stand! Because you wanted to use my reputation to get into the best hospital in New York!""

""He... I covered my chest, realizing I couldn't make a sound. I had always thought that at least one thing was true - that even though he didn't love me, he believed in my honesty. Now, the past six years felt like a massive cesspool, constantly nauseating me.""





""I could no longer bear it,"" I was suddenly tired of this endless bickering. I had a feeling it was going to destroy us all sooner or later, including Millie.





With that thought, I made my decision. I sniffed and wiped the lone tear that rolled down my cheeks. I swallowed hard and stared at Tyler again—with a blank expression this time.





“zIB wawnNtR a. zdNifvorcfeL.n”U





His forehead creased. “What?”





I looked down and balled my trembling fists before I looked at him again with teary eyes. “We’re not gonna work out, Tyler. Let’s just divorce.”





His lips parted. He stared at me for a few seconds before he brushed his fingers against his hair and let out a sarcastic laugh. He turned his back and turned to me again with a ridiculed expression before his face mirrored his anger.





“aAndd( yroud thiGnk Ib’ll, lest you pgso!? PHuh? qYsoluD Ith(inkr Yy,ou caOn ptutk an eGnd Ptow ft\*hims thQa.t eyasil,y?\_ RliQghxt$ a'frtAexrY yovu FrukiKneTd! mmy. rlgiXfe(?”H





“You don’t want this marriage, right? You’ve been constantly cheating on me, Tyler! I want out! I quit! Just wait for the divorce agreement and you can finally be with your mistresses—”





“No one’s divorcing, Serena!” He growled and punched the wall. His chest was moving up and down rapidly. His face and neck were so red as violence showed in his eyes.





I gasped in shock and stared at him. He headed to me. The violence in his eyes was so scary.





""D,on\*'tK e)venw dreamR YofI klyeaBv\_ingM, Sevrena.f ,B!asc!ké Éwh&enV you( rhajdy tqhVeU WgÉuKts' t,oy wstDeDa!l Gmqyb seVedZsz, yXoué shouDldW havOe óbCeBeBn prebparNerd Cfvo)rR nmtyu rsevengJeg.""\*





Anger was dripping in every corner of my body again. Yes, I got pregnant unplanned. But it wasn’t entirely my fault. We did it together so how am I to blame alone?





I could no longer tolerate how he treated me and I grabbed the lampshade and threw it at him. He used his arms to cover his chest and it created a shallow cut on his arm. I saw it clearly but I ignored it. The wound he inflicted in my heart is much deeper than that mere cut. It was nothing compared to what he made me feel in this marriage.





He looked at me and clenched his jaws. “Go on! Throw everything. Ruin everything but I will not allow you to get away. You brought this upon us, Serena. You ruined my life so I will ruin yours too. I promise you…I will never allow you to be happy. Not until I die in your hands and you’re finally free.”





“MGo…fmy…TdHaWdFa…)”I





My anger immediately vanished and worry filled me. I saw Tyler’s expression change too as I turned to where the voice came from.





Rubbing her eyes while standing by the door connecting to her bedroom, was Millie. She’s wearing her pink sleepwear and it obviously looked like we woke her up.





“Sweetie…” I walked towards her and carried her.

My lips parted. Before I could answer, Tyler stood beside me and put his arm around my waist. He kissed Millie’s cheek and caressed her hair.





“Of course not. Mommy and Daddy aren’t fighting, princess.” Tyler’s gentle voice was so clear in my ear. When was the last time I heard him talk to me using that gentle voice? It sounds so absurd but I’m starting to regret the day I married him.





“Why don’t we go back to your room, sweetie? I’ll sing you to sleep.”





S(heM KshDoyokR chePr hJeaPd. “GM'ilhliNe awangts to) TsAlQeepv withc mommcy afnód Hdabddy…f”p





Tyler carried her from me, distracting her from our messy bedroom. “Of course! Princess can do whatever she wants. Let’s go!”





My eyes followed them as Tyler carried Millie to her bedroom and put her on her small bed. He put the blanket on her before he looked at me. I had no choice. I don’t want my daughter to think that we’re fighting. I climbed on the bed and lay beside Millie. Tyler was on the other side, staring at me intently.





“Mommy, sing…” Millie whispered. I smiled and started caressing her hair as I started singing softly. I could feel Tyler’s stares but I ignored him completely.

I looked at him and met his blazing eyes. He clenched his jaws as his eyes darkened even more.





“Don’t ever bring up divorce again, Serena. There’s no way I’ll let you go and escape this miserable life.""





""You are destined to suffer with me. You are mine.”

Serena's POV





""Are you just going to let him do that? That bastard! After he cheated so many times, he doesn't even want a divorce! I want to barge into his office right now and kill him!""

I had my hands on the steering wheel and sighed, ""Selina, calm down. Last night I was too angry too, that's why I brought up divorce...you know, for now I don't want to hurt Millie, she needs her father.""





""Serena!"" she groaned. ""Millie needs a happy mother more. Or are you still in love with that bastard!""





Do I still love Taylor? This morning after watching Taylor leave, when I thought about separating from him, I couldn't hold back my tears anymore. Maybe, for the past six years I've always loved Taylor, never stopped. No matter how many times he showed he didn't care about me.

I couldn't breathe...





I took a deep breath, then said, ""Selina...you don't understand marriage, before I got married, I swore that once my husband cheated, I would leave without hesitation. But when I had a child, I found...I couldn't do it so decisively anymore.""





""Maybe you think I'm weak, stupid. But the fact is, when Millie was born, I found myself becoming a coward."" I lowered my head, the road ahead suddenly turned into an ocean, I was drifting on it, feeling lost inside.

""Okay..."" I answered with a choked voice. Before my depression comes back to me, I need to cheer up quickly. No matter what, I need to get rid of Taylor's influence on me.





""I wish Auntie and Uncle were here..."" The car stopped, and she hugged me again. I felt a lot better. Selina was right, if my parents hadn't had that accident, I believe Taylor and I might not even have crossed paths.





But I have to face reality, I pushed Selina away, my assistant's name appeared on my phone screen again. ""Selina, don't worry, I'm a doctor, I remember my duty, I'll be responsible for any of my patients.""

When I reached the hospital, I was immediately occupied by the patients scheduled for the day. It was past lunchtime when I received a call from Maria. She never called me without a valid reason so I immediately answered the call in case of emergency.





“Hello, Maria?”





\[Serena! I couldn't contact your husband. Can you come over to Millie’s school? She got injured and she won’t stop crying.\]

“I’ll be there quickly. Try to calm her down, Maria.”





\[Okay. Drive safely.\]





I immediately hung up the phone, ran towards the elevator, and called Taylor while walking towards the garage.

Bastard! He's always not around at critical moments. Does Millie really need a father who's never there for her?





By the time I reached Millie's kindergarten, I was out of breath. The teacher was waiting for me at the entrance and immediately told me what happened as we quickly walked towards the nurse's office.





""Mrs. Walter, she was playing with her friends when she suddenly tripped and fell. Her arm hit the table, just a minor bleeding, but I'm concerned about infection or other issues, so I still recommend taking her to the hospital for further examination,"" the teacher said apologetically.





I li\_mmXedMiaPtemly Mfuound Mil'l\^iTeD and cLheckezdr 'he,r cfo!n$dSiRtioVnU.





""Mommy!"" Millie saw me.





“Sweetie…” I kissed her forehead and caressed her hair. She’s already so sweaty. I held her carefully, trying not to hurt her bruised arm.





She whimpered in my arms, ""Mommy, where's daddy?""

She nodded tearfully but disappointment couldn't be hidden in her eyes. I sighed, carrying her out of the school to the nearby clinic.





""Don't worry, Mrs. Walter. Her arm has got some scrapes but nothing serious. Just be careful not to wet the wound when you bathe her.""





I nodded and walked out of the medical room only to catch Millie sitting on the hallway bench with her head hung low and Maria accompanied her with a worried face. My little girl must be sad that her Daddy hadn't shown up yet.

I dropped the phone and walked to Millie, ready to take her home. But as soon as I crouched down in front of her, I sensed that she was unusually depressed.





“Hey sweetie, what happened?” I asked softly, caressing her face.





Tears welled up in her eyes again, ""Mommy, why didn't Daddy answer me?” and her voice shook, ""Does...Does Daddy not want me?”

""Millie was just a little bored so I took her out on the balcony for a while and then she saw..."" her voice grew fainter yet Millie wept first.





""I saw Daddy with another kid! I called him but he didn't answer me! Daddy doesn't want me!""





My mind went blank and I felt my blood freeze. I was about to call Tyler again when my private investigator sent me a message with a picture attached to it. My heart clenched in anger.

The last bit of faith I had in holding on to this marriage was shattered.





When Catherine Smith came back, I had no chance of winning. And Tyler had just proved it with his actions.

Serena’s POV





I lifted my face and looked at Maria. She’s obviously panicking as she tries to caress my shoulder to calm me down. “S-Serena, it might be a mistake. Millie was still shocked and she must’ve mistook that man for her father.”

“Mommy! Does my daddy hate me?”





I immediately carried Millie carefully and caressed her cheeks, wiping her tears. I felt like crying too. My daughter’s tears are my weakness. I don’t wanna see her crying and I’ll make Tyler pay for hurting our daughter.





I sniffed and shook my head. “That’s not daddy.”





“BBk-Buté…”n





I pressed my lips on her cheek, long but gentle. “That’s not daddy, sweetheart. Daddy is working.”





She looked at me with eyes full of tears although it had stopped rolling down her cheeks. “You’re not lying?”





I shook my head. I am but you shouldn’t know.

I can’t believe this! He already cheated and if he already has a child with another woman, why won’t he give me what I want? Why won’t he give my freedom back?





I had a hard time convincing Millie to sleep. She keeps on asking me about her father and up until now, I’m still trying to reach him, not wanting to give up for my daughter’s sake. But Millie has already fallen asleep without even hearing anything from Tyler.





This doesn't seem to be a punishment. For what? For marrying the man I loved? After my one-night stand with Taylor, I even avoided him. I tried so hard to escape from him, but his father found out I was pregnant. His father forced him to marry me, plus Taylor's father believed he had to respect my parents. My parents were good friends with Taylor's parents before they passed away.

I didn't see them in bed, but Taylor never denied it. Since then, Taylor's arms have always had different women. Even if I didn't see them having sex, I don't believe a man and woman would just be together for simple conversation.





When I saw Catherine's face, my fingers started trembling.. Tyler looked so happy and…content. He'd never looked like that in all the years we'd been married. And neither with his other mistresses. Why? The answer was right beside him. Catherine Smith, the only woman Tyler Walter had loved.





I suddenly realized that perhaps I had been able to tolerate his cheating before only because I subconsciously knew that none of those women posed a threat and I had his love for Millie. But now? I was not sure anymore. When Catherine returned, he would get over us soon, wouldn't he?

“You were so happy about your old love's return that you forgot your own daughter, weren't you?”





He paused when he heard my voice. I smelled the strong scent of alcohol and it made me angrier. While I was busy soothing Millie's broken heart, he was out having fun with his old flame. How shameless! How disgusting!





Tyler looked at me with dark and cold eyes before he threw his coat on the couch. His sleeves were folded up to his elbow and the first two buttons of his dress shirt were open. His hair is messy and his eyes are reddish and sleepy.

“What did you say?” He asked violently.





I smirked and pulled myself up as he watched me with hawk-like eyes. He still has the guts to look at me that way. To get mad when he was the one who did me wrong.





“I see your new flavor of the week was a familiar face. Was she good in bed?”

I wasn't afraid and laughed sarcastically again. ""Why not? Taylor, you're still my husband! What she's doing is no different from a slut!""





His hand tightened around my neck again, but I waited for him, unflinching. My courage grew after I realized I no longer harbored any illusions.





Finally, Taylor sighed and let me go. But I didn't want to live like this anymore. Serena was right, Millie needed a happy mother. With her father having other children, she would be even more neglected.

Taylor's gaze was fixed on the divorce papers, his chest heaving. I didn't understand what he was angry about. I thought he needed time to look over the terms, but when I turned around, I heard the sound of papers being torn.





""I said we're not getting divorced! I won't hurt Millie!"" he said angrily before trying to leave me.





He had the nerve to say he wouldn't hurt Millie. When Millie was hurt, he was holding the child he had with another woman, yet he said he wouldn't hurt Millie!

""Millie was hurt. I called you several times today, but you didn't answer. How can you say that?"" I asked painfully and angrily. ""Your daughter was crying for her dad, but you didn't show up for so long. How can you say that? You've been ignoring us, Taylor!""





""Millie was hurt?"" he grabbed me and asked urgently.





I immediately broke free from him and said coldly, ""Don't pretend to be a good father. You have other children! You're Millie's biggest abuser!""

He shook his head so slowly and dangerously. His drunk eyes were never leaving mine as if I’d disappear if he looked away even for a second and it intensifies his anger.





“You’ll have to kill me first, Serena. Only then you can be free.”

Chapter 4  A Shameless Doesn't Feel Ashamed





Serena’s POV





I fell asleep sitting and crying on the couch. It was already morning when I opened my eyes again. I was already lying comfortably on the couch. A soft pillow was under my head and a thick blanket was covering me.

I rubbed my eyes. My vision wasn’t clear and I could feel that my eyes were swollen badly for some reason. I still feel exhausted. I still feel drained... I think I need a cold shower.





“I’m glad you’re now awake.”





I dropped my eyes on Maria before I roamed my eyes around.

I nodded. “Can you prepare a coffee for me? I’ll just take a quick bath.”





“You don’t look good. Are you going to the hospital today?”





I nodded. “I temporarily switched shifts with a coworker yesterday, and I have to fill in today.”

I let out a bitter laugh. He’s an excellent businessman but he couldn’t even make a proper husband.





I turned the radio on, only to frown again when I heard the episode of the magazine interview. I left the radio on as I started driving again and the interview started.





‘Thank you for this opportunity, Mr. Walter. Since you’re one of the best CEOs, why don’t we start the interview with your inspiration? Who or what motivates you to be one of the best?’





‘WzeJll…i’





Tyler’s voice has always been handsome and soothing. If he’s calm, his voice would comfort anyone who hears it. It’s sweet and gentle. Something I admired about him.





‘It seems Mr. Walter has a special someone.’





The tease was followed by soft laughs. I swallowed hard as my heart raced. A special someone?

I gripped the steering wheel. Liar!





‘I have a cute and bubbly child. A wife…a beautiful wife. A caring and loving wife.’





My hands started trembling. I immediately turned the radio off and stopped the car in front of the hospital where I was working. He described a family that doesn’t suit what we have. Is he talking about his mistress and his illegitimate child?

I was walking towards my office when I received a call. Mrs. Walter, Tyler's mother. I can just ignore this call and turn my phone off but I was raised and taught to respect people even when they don’t respect me at all.





“Hello, Mrs. Walter—”





\[What happened to my granddaughter, Serena? What have you been doing? You should be taking care of her and not working like a slave. Why can’t you be a responsible mother and wife to my son and granddaughter, huh? Don’t you really care for your family?\]

\[Then why did she get injured? Huh?\]





Some people say your greatest enemy when you get married is your mother-in-law and that’s really true. Mrs. Walter has always been unjust and rude to me. She never liked me as her son’s wife because she believed that I was a cunning woman aiming at their property. Oh, fck the Walters! Yes, my family was not as powerful as them but we're not desperate. Without the Walters, I could also feed Millie well!





\[Quit your job, Serena! You’re only burdening my son for abandoning my granddaughter! You need to focus on Millie because I’m telling you if something bad happens to my granddaughter, I will never forgive you!\]





“I GcMan\^ .takeó caIrme 'ofK Pmy dRauFghtemrj ,perfeGct$ly ywhLiÉlteX pwZomrkTing,l jMlris.k Wanlte\_r. D\_oYn’\^t worwry& aboult\_ MiXlliep.. CIP YknoFw Ywchakt' \_to pdo.u”





\[You stubborn wench! I’ll tell Tyler about this–\]





“Sorry for cutting you off, Mrs. Walter. I have a duty today so I need to go. Go tell your son about what we discussed. Also, convince him to agree on what I want.”

I ended the call as my face turned blank. I don’t care about Tyler’s opinion anymore. The fact that he broke my daughter’s heart and he’s considering another woman and child as his family is enough. I’ve had enough. I can no longer endure this shitty marriage.





I messaged my private investigator to get me the list of the best lawyers in the country. I was frustrated while checking the list because all of them were connected to the Walters. Tyler has a broad connection and he has secured a strong relationship with powerful families in the country including the family of the lawyers that were listed on the document my private investigator has given me.





Before my shift ended, I requested another list of lawyers from my private investigator and he can only give me three names. One, a lawyer who was notorious for playing dirty in the courtroom. The only decent from the three listed names was the name of a man I know very well.

I was walking in the lobby of the hospital, aiming to the exit when I saw a familiar someone walking with a familiar child. A child… who resembles my husband. The woman walking with the child was talking to someone over her phone when our gazes met.





Hatred reigned in my heart as our gazes locked as if she surprisingly smiled at me, making my blood boil in so much anger. Catherine Smith has the guts. Where did she get the courage to smile at me?

Chapter 5  Heartless





Serena’s POV





My anger was dripping so the best choice was to ignore her. I didn’t smile back or what. I just continued walking. I successfully walked past her but she suddenly called my name which made me stop for some reason.





“óYDoRu’ór(ei Do'ctÉorM Anson, rigDht\^?”





Doctor Anson. Right! I forgot I refused to change my name even when I married Tyler. My name is the only memory I have of my parents. I don’t wanna lose it. Having Millie to carry her father’s name is enough for me but I guess Tyler misunderstood my intention.





“I’m sure you’re Doctor Anson. Can I have a minute with you?” Catherine is now in front of me. The child with her was looking at me and I immediately noticed something wrong in his eyes. However, his resemblance to my husband is really distracting.





“Uhm… Is your shift over? I’m sorry this is just really urgent. I need your help.”

“I know we only met and it’s shameless of me to ask this but…can you help me? My son Andy has a condition. I…need a physician for him.”





My forehead creased. She came here to ask me to be her son’s physician? Does she even know me? Because if she asked me now, I know her. I know her very well even though I only met her a few times when we were in college. I saw how her relationship with Tyler goes. I know how passionate their love for each other was. I used to envy her and I still feel so jealous of her until now.





I took a deep breath and shook my head. “I’m sorry, Miss, but I can’t just accept a patient.”





“PPul\_eaNse! PsleaPsbe!I JYcohu’,r!e. msy\* sonÉ’s on\^lQy' hopUe, GDWocto\^rR DASnsonw.S”





I shook my head. “How come you know me?”





She smiled shyly and caressed her neck. “Uhm… A close friend recommended you to me. He said you’re an excellent ophthalmologist.”





I balled my fists. And I’m supposed to thank Tyler for complimenting me while recommending me to his mistress?

“I said I can’t be your son’s physician, Miss.”





She looked down and she started sobbing. My lips parted in both shock and anger. Is she really crying right now? Does she think I’d change my mind? I already told her my reasons. Is she deaf or just plain stupid to not realize what I just said?





“I c-can’t find another doctor to trust. I-I was actually having second thoughts of coming here but when a special friend recommended you…I gave it a try…since you’re the best in the country.”





“If I have to kneel and beg you to be my son’s physician, I will do it! Please, Doctor Anson. You’re the only one I can trust to save my son’s future. Please! Please, save my son’s future.”





My eyes widened when she let go of her son’s hand and kneeled in front of me.





“What are you doing?” I growled angrily.





“What are you doing? Get up!” I am panicking. The people around are watching and some are even fellow doctors who know me.



She shook her head and looked up at me. “I won’t get up until you agree to be my son’s physician.”



“Why are you doing this? I told you that’s not my line of expertise!” My voice was starting to rise. Now, the crowd is getting bigger.



“Your son’s kneeling too! What are you doing?” I growled angrily. How dare she use her son? Does she know about me and Tyler and she’s making me look like the bad guy here?



She looked at her son before she looked at me again. “He wants to get better.”



Anger overpowered me again. “I’m not the one who can help you. Just stop this and leave!”







“What the hell are you doing, Serena?!”



My lips parted as I slowly turned to the man who just came. He was looking at me angrily. His eyes were bloodshot again and he was already judging me without even asking what really happened.





I felt so disappointed so I ignored him. I was about to leave when he blocked my way and looked at me with a more violent reaction.











I balled my fists and clenched my jaws as I met his sharp eyes, equaling the intensity of his anger—even surpassing it if I could. I guess he didn’t even try to love me even once. He only knows that I’m a doctor. An ophthalmologist. He doesn’t even know my specialty. Really! How blind was I to not realize this before?

I shook my head as I looked at him with disappointment. “That’s what you’re good at. Coming late and judging me based on your stupid deduction of what happened. That’s what you’re good at, Tyler. Guilt tripping. I can’t believe I married you.”

Trudy Blunt didn’t lose her last fuck.

She hurled it like a brick through a school board window.

It was a Tuesday. Or maybe a Thursday. Time had already stopped mattering. She was sitting in a PTA meeting that smelled like wet carpet and unmedicated opinions. Some guy named Rick—buttoned-up, insecure, probably a youth pastor—said the words, “Let’s not make this political.”

And that was it.

Trudy stood up, holding a stale croissant like a weapon, eyes full of ancient rage. “Rick,” she said, “if I had even half a fuck left, I’d save it for something that bleeds.”

Gasps. Clutches of pearls. Someone started to cry. Trudy didn’t blink. “You’re all beige-souled cowards,” she said, tossing the croissant at a poster that read ‘Empathy Starts Here!’ “I hope your Facebook accounts get hacked and only post pictures of your feet.”

She kicked over a folding chair and walked out with the kind of confidence usually reserved for action heroes or people who’ve just peed in the boss’s coffee.

That day, Trudy stopped paying bills.
She flipped off her job via email.
She told her ex, “I hope the next girl you gaslight has teeth and a felony record.”

Her neighbor tried to hand her a coupon for lawn service and said, “Some of us still care about curb appeal.”
Trudy took it, smiled, and whispered, “I hope your dog starts humping you during your Zoom calls, Carol.”
Then she licked the coupon and stuck it to their window like a threat.

And somewhere in that wild, smoking ruin of her former life, she started hearing whispers.

There’s another.
He gave his last fuck in a gas station and disappeared into legend.
Mitch.

She didn’t care. Didn’t even finish the story. But something about it made her pack a bag (half full of hot sauce and court documents) and walk into the goddamn horizon.

Because if there was a Mitch, he might be the only human being unhinged enough to deserve the last of her attention.

Maybe.

If he didn’t talk too much.

Last year I lost a family member I was ridiculously close to. After the usual barrage of condolences and photo slideshows, I found myself wishing I could just *ask them* things again—the little stuff, like how they’d roast my terrible coffee or what they’d think of a new song. So I hacked together **Inspiri-Forever**: a service that stitches all the fragments we keep—texts, voice notes, photos, quirks—into a conversational AI that sounds and feels *like your person*.

You can try a quick demo here → [**www.inspirit-forever.com**](http://www.inspiri-forever.com/)

# How it works (human terms)

1. You share any memories (voice clips, screenshots, random fun facts).
2. I fine-tune a private model on *just those* memories—no generic dataset mashups.
3. You get a link where you can text or speak with the replica, whenever you need a moment with them.

It’s perfect, and sometimes wonderfully weird—but every time the replica nails a tiny inside joke, it feels like borrowing five extra minutes with someone you love.

# Want one? DM me.

I’m personally building the next batch for free because I need honest feedback from real people in real situations. **(Full disclosure: each replica costs me money to host & fine-tune, but that’s okay—I’m looking for funding and the learning is priceless.)**

If you’re curious—or even just skeptical—shoot me a DM. Tell me a bit about who you miss, and I’ll walk you through the process (totally private, consent-driven, delete-anytime).

Thanks for reading. Whether or not you try  I hope you call, text, or hug someone you love today. Those moments are gold.

We've tried to focus on going fewer places and having a little more time at each so that we're not driving hours every day and seeing the country through the rental car windshield. Main interests are hikes, wineries, breweries, and coffee. Planning to mostly stay in airbnbs with a view so when the kiddo goes down for the night we can drink on the porch.

Day 1: Arrive in Auckland. Pick up the rental car and head to an airport hotel to rest up.

Day 2: Drive/ferry to Waiheke Island. Beach/Breweries

Day 3: Wineries on Waiheke Island

Day 4: Waiheke - Taupo. Nothing special in Taupo, just somewhere to break up the trip to Wellington. We'll probably hit a brewery and walk around the lake then go to bed early. Might just be better to fly Auckland to Wellington.

Day 5: Taupo - Wellington

Day 6: Explore Wellington. We've heard it's the craft beer capital of NZ.

Day 7: Wellington - Nelson

Day 8: Day trip to Abel Tasman. Return to Nelson for the night.

Day 9: Nelson - Kaikoura

Day 10: Kaikoura - Christchurch (or somewhere near by. Heard there's somewhere to meet alpacas nearby).

Day 11: Christchurch - Lake Tekapo

Day 12: Explore Lake Tekapo

Day 13: Lake Tekapo - Wanaka

Day 14: Explore Wanaka

Day 15: Roy's peak then drive to Queenstown

Day 16: Queenstown

Day 17: Fly out of Queenstown

For naturals and honey beans it was 15 clicks while it was 14 for washed ones. However, I seem to be troubling to find a reference, a starting point at my new grinder. I know the process of beans isn't solely a decisive factor for grind size but it should give a rough idea how fine you're gonna go.

I've seen some posts saying that they are really happy with 4:6 method hovering over 28-32 clicks with C40. I actually used to do 4:6 with my C3 but eventually I found out that the coffee didn't tasta the way it should so I quit. Now I use a simple total water amount/3-4 with medium-fine grind size recipe.

  
So, I feel kinda puzzled where to start. Either I should change my starting recipe (and the grind size accordingly) or experiment with grind size (which I unfortunately don't have enough time)

We have a crisis in America, even in what some consider the most neighborly city in the US in the heart of Happy Valley.

I would like to bring attention to those who are and have gone through abuse, trauma and falling into addiction.

I am a recovering addict, I have had experiences in my life that have created trauma and at a certain point in my late 40s I finally hit rock bottom.  I turned to substance abuse to cope and deal with what the present moment was presenting to me.  

This last week I experienced what life was like on the streets of Provo, homeless.  

I am a man who recovering addict.  I am a man who has faced lifetime of trauma and a man who went to hell on earth to what I am today, a human being who is on the healing path. 

I never knew addiction up until my late 30s into my later years as now a 50 year old man. I judged those who had addiction, believing as the culture I grew up in that they were weak.  Every homeless person I saw as a young man I believed was just lazy and just didn't want to work.  

This last week having spent some nights in a warming center in South Provo, really just a storage warehouse for the county maintenance.  There are 2 other churches in Provo that provide warmth during the winter months up until April 30. 

My partner has been working with the unhoused of Utah county for 10+ years.  My partner introduced me to this community of eccentric, brilliant, artistic and yet so broken, like I am.  I resonate with so many of those whom are invisible to society. 

I came out Friday afternoon after working a night shift, I woke earlier than usually so that I can be on a day schedule. I was already tired only sleeping 4 hours that morning. 
I put together a camping backpack, a long with basic essentials, a sleeping bag and an extra pad to lay on.  I packed too many clothes for a 3 day venture, I was told this by a man who was unhoused that I had too much.  I knew I did when I packed it, but I needed to see for myself if I could experience this as me being me. I have a tendency to over prepare for trips, it was the life of an OTR driver.  

My partner and I headed out to the Provo Central station where bus meets train, from there we could take a bus to the Provo City library.  

We hopped on the UVX bus which head up University Ave, our destination was the Provo City Library.  It's not too far to walk it, but when your carrying a pack, which it literally everything you own in the world, carts and bags get really heavy, especially after a night of little to no sleep.  

We stop off at the library to go in to use the rest room.  This is one a a small handful of places an unhoused person can venture in order to rest, watch videos, read, crochet even schedule meetings in one of the many rooms.  But it also a slight sense of freedom where an unhoused person won't get harassed, a much.  

We ran into a couple of friends on the grass on the west side of the library, I knew one personally but was also introduced to a native man in his late 30s.  We started to have a conversation with one another, he spoke of his growing up on the reservation as well as our personal beliefs in the divine.  He shared some of his trauma with me, recently that morning his prized jacket was stolen from him, an item he had had for 10+ years. 

We have a lot in common, and getting to know him I felt a kindred spirit.  

My partner was having a conversation with woman who wed met sitting along with the man I had just met.  I met her about a month ago, mid 50's and a fireball.  In the past week she had an operation on a large hernia inher abdomen. A few weeks prior she had no where to go except the warming centers to sleep at night. She had been denied by her therapist as well as the cooalition for services that she was needing deparatly such as a motel voucher for her recovery afterwards.  The coalition is an operation that has a stranglehold on those who speak up for those that are the most vulnerable such as this woman.  Because she had decided to expresss her emotions outloud and use her first amendment right, let alone needs for a human being, she was denied.  She was distraut and crippled from her condition.  She spoke up and within a day or two of her doing that she was not allowed to obtain services through the coalition.  

She was given oer resources through my partner in order to obtain a voucher and recieved one for a few weeks for recovery.  A day after her operation, still in pain ad using a makeshift cane out of a tree branch my partner and i brought over some supplies and groceries to her motel room.  I had been in these rooms for other people on the street and it's not the most pleasant envirment to heal in.  The motel is poor conditon and if I were to give aYelp review it would recieve 0 stars.  It is roach motel with dilapidated fixtures, plumbing issues, illicit activities.  This is only one of the few facilities that have a motel voucher for those who are attempting to get off the streets, have a job and keep it, simply temporary housing for those that have none.  Struggling people who deal with mental issues, abuse, extreme poverty and so many other issues.

This was a woman fled an abusive relationship in the midwest but born into the predomiate religion of Utah.  A woman who had been ine sexually, psychogically and physically abused.  Like so many of the women on the street coming from a religious background and assaulted by those in authority.  this happens more often than we choose to believe in our beloved Utah.  Behind closed doors, women are chattel and are told that they are equal with the male and yet are told to be the quiet timid house wife in order to obey the husband.  I pray that this will change and that men in our community will stand up for the fairer sex, understand that what the world needs is balance and a relationsip with the feminine nature of what humanity truly is, is both masculine and feminine.  We have an equal part of of both our mothers and our fathers in us.  Treat the feminine as we would our grandmothers, with kindness and respect.

From the library my partner and I decided to go play pool at the Provo rec center.  We are both avid pool players, we both love to shoot a table, go and find a pool table and play 3-5 games along with a coke and spicy fries or a vegatarian sandwich from Ernies dowtown Provo.  This experience going to the Rec center would be different than the many other times we've gone to play at the rec center, this time we were carrying our home on our backs.  Walking across University Avenue from the library, the looks i saw on some peoples faces were of disgust and avoidance.  On the other side of the street were a couple standing at the cross walk waiting to cross.  The backwards step and body language told me that they didn't want to be near us as we passed by them.  This happened several times throughout my 3 day stay on the street.

We got the the rec center and I was told by my partner that we couldn't linger outside on the grass or we would get ticketed for loitering. We had an empty table that we could play on, which typically on a friday afternoon the rec room that holds the tables is full.   We set our bags down, I went and got the cues and billiards, played for about an hour and decided to head down to center, stopping at smiths on the way there to pick up a pint of ice cream.  Walking into smiths your not allowed to bring in bags.  i stood at the entrance while my partner went in and got the treat.  

We walked downtown center Street to the LDS city Center temple and sat on the grass.  In the background was a girl, late 20s early 30s dressed in this bright yellow evening gown in front of the bronze statue of a mother and father with a child in the middle.  The whole scene was surreal.

This girl was taking dozens of selfies in poses that seemed to sometimes be proactive, on the temple ground. Unaware of what she was doing apparently there were several people like ourselves just gazing wondering why here of all places is her vanity so important.  A man came up, dressed in a black shirt and tie and they were taking selfies together.  Such a strange things to see late afternoon on a Friday. 

It was around 645 when we finished our ice cream, the bus to the red warehouse would be arriving soon, so we waited on the city center temple lawn, under the large sycamore tree in the shade. Temperatures the duration of my stay were mild and warm, I wasn't truly experiencing what those on the street are. Still in the shade on a late 70s temp was nice.  

Not a whole lot to do while waiting except wait and have the possible stranger come up and ask if we needed anything.  

Random acts of kindness happen, it doesn't happen all too often but it does. 

Around 715 we walk to the bus platform where the UVX will take us to the Provo Central station, where bus meets train. 

The bus arrives and there are several of our compatriots already on board, bags, packs, cart, wagons and a few dogs whom are companions for the unhoused, not only for protection but as another way to not feel lonely while on the street.  There were a few select seats open.  My partner sat along with their bag in an aisle seat, I stood and held onto a strap affixed to the bar overhead so that I may stay balanced while the bus took off. 
It only took 5-7 mins from downtown to reach the central terminal.  Offloaded our gear along with several others whom were going to the same destination we were.  

I'd run into a couple of people whom I'd already known and chatted it up.  Some had nothing, some even on the street gathered everything they had and packed it into a wagon or another way to haul around everything they had.  

The 821 arrived around 810pm, in order to get to the red warehouse and get a 'good' spot to set our homes down and sleep we needed to be on that bus.  It's only a 5-10 min drive but still 3-4 miles away and getting there on foot would take a couple of hours.  

My partner and I along with a couple of dozen of our comrades loads onto the bus.  Standing room only when it was all said and done.  One passenger had a stroller for her 2 small Chihuahua mixed dogs, along with the rest of her home.  I again stayed on my feet, backpack on and hanging on to the rail stairs in order to keep my balance.  

We made a couple of other stops on the way to the warehouse.  Loaded a couple of more passengers on until we were full for this trip.  

The driver whom was courteous to those who needed the on board ramp to load/offload carts, wagons and bags.  

We arrived to the stop which was just across the street from the warehouse. We were not allowed to step foot on the county property until 845 or a trespass ticket would be issued as well as the threat of not being allowed to sleep there for the night.  So we bide our time and wait.  

When 845 rolled around we walked across state Street to wait in line outside the red building as it is called.  Volunteers were inside setting up sleeping pads, a 1/2 in thick pads that will allow for slight padding against the cold concrete floor that would be turned into a bed for the night. 

They opened the doors around 9pm.  There are donated blankets, clothes, food, a place to make a small microwavable meal.  Union entering there were volunteers at a table, paperwork that you fill in with your information, this is to help keep a tally of people coming in for the night.  Provo, has had an influx of 500+ unhoused people come through these doors alone.  The count starts from trying to find camps last summer estimated that there were only 150-200 unhoused in southern Utah county.  That's only if they find the camps and if people want to interact with you during a summer night.  

This number doesn't include those who don't want to have anything to do with the warming centers.  Estimates on how many unhoused are higher than the proposed tally. 

My partner and I set up our sleeping bags, got the things out that we would need for the night and took my sleeping meds so that I would be able to at least try to get a wink.  This was a schedule my body and brain aren't used to as I work a NOC shifts as a CNA.  

Shoes off, use the bathroom to wash up with. 
The warming center has 1/2 in thick pads that are layed out on the floor with only 6 inches between you and the person next to you, yes cramped like sardines. All who come in are tired, some hungry and most just want a warm dry place to lay their head for the night.  

There were between 85-100 ppl there this night, the weather outside has been mildly warm and with less than a month left of the warming centers some have already picked spots to set up camp for the coming months, hopefully undisturbed by anyone, especially police.  

It is illegal to camp in the state of Utah inside city limits.  The police will ticket you for camping, confiscate all your belongings and place you under arrest if you happen to camp.  What you carry on you is your home, your belongings can all disappear in an instant if you don't follow the law.  It's absolutely inhumane how the unhoused are treated, but then again what is humane when it's humans carrying out the cruelty of those who are looked down upon by society. 

With my sleeping bag rolled out on top of my blow up pad and the 'yoga' mat I lay my head down for the night, lights out at 10.  Prior to lights out rules are requested by the man in charge.  Any fights break out your automatically expelled from the facility.  Voice levels need to be low and there is no tolerance for theft or violence.  

The red warehouse floor is virtually full with no room at the inn at this point.  This is a mid spring night, warmer outside.  I imagine how to the mid winters are, freezing cold out, cold floors, coming in damp or completely freezing, sick from the elements.  I can't imagine doing this day in day out, hearded around the city like chattel, not allowed to really sit still and rest, let alone try to even begin a process of transitioning into a home.  

With shoes off, unkempt and no bathing for a couple of days the smell reminded me of my high school locker room after football practice.  Body order, stinky feet, which Im sure with mine added to it became rank.  All within an enclosed small warehouse, more like a mechanics work bag with large doors, no airflow.  

I was tired, 4 hours of sleep the morning of this experience coming off a shift that ended at 6am that morning.  I placed in ear plugs to cut down on the noise and lights were out.  The volunteers watched a movie on a makeshift sheet/screen while the masses attempted to drift off to sleep.  

Around 6 I the warehouse was awakened by music blaring An American Child by Phil Vassar.  Choice song for the day as we are all trying to survive in today's America.  From this point its gathering and placing everything you own back into your bag, cart or nothing at all.  

Most people that sleep there have nothing, blankets are turned in to be washed and used for the next night, mats are wiped down with clorox wipes.  Donuts, coffee, other food was on a table for anything you needed for sustenance for the day.  

Bags rolled and packed, my morning ritual of stretching out and getting my body limber were forgotten as we had to catch the bus into town.  To get to the stop we walked 1/8th mile on a hill upgrade, filed into the bus and taken back to East Bay.  We got off at Sam's club, walked from there to the Food and Care Coalition where we would eat breakfast.  

Breakfast consulted of an oven baked eggs, hash browns and sausage, a store bought muffin, oatmeal and cut up orange slices.  FCC offers 3 meals a day 6 days a week excluding Sundays most of the time.  Breakfast was ok, very high in salt and sugar but sustainable to the body. I could tell right away that my digestive tract after eating it would be hurting or blocked up later.  

Having eaten there several times prior to this experience the food used to be better.  The chef that used to put together the meals was very good and at this point after being let go very missed.  It's another story for another time considering how FCC is ran and somewhat mismanaged from my own perspective as well as several stories I have heard in the last few months. 

After breakfast we walk to the bus stop to await UVX to take us to University Mall in Orem. We sat on the bench, many of our comrades along with us.  The conversations are always enlightening.  One man whom I've known for almost a year is a tall black man, dread locks and brilliant.  He and I have had several discussions over the last few months and umthey are always enlightening.  His experience as an unhoused black man in Provo isn't something I can relate too, but racism is a huge ordeal in a city that bases itself on diversity.  It truly isn't as it claims. Provo has placed several masks on itself.  When my ancestors settled this city in the 1800s it had to massacre it's inhabitants in order to establish their settlements. It's a sad history that Provo let alone the Mormon settlers of the territory will possibly never own up to.  

This black man coming from Southern California into the whitest city in Utah is an awareness I'll never experience, growing up just North of Provo in Pleasant Grove I always wanted to get out of Utah, let alone Utah county.  Why did I come back I always question?  

Maybe it's to grow and understand that I, as a Utah bred Mormon white boy could possibly make a difference in my community.  I've always been that quiet kid who just sits in a corner, observing you! Maybe I'm here because I feel my ancestors need me in Provo to help heal the community that they hurt?  So many questions and yet I have a voice!  A voice that could possibly being aware was to something that is destroying the human soul.  

From here I rant about the plight of the community that I have witnessed and observed with my own eyes, felt the strain of being impoverished and my own abandonment issues I've experienced my whole life, being the 3 child of 8 children, to a father that was never home.  Either working or church callings but never truly home with his family.  Being that overbearing narcissistic parent who established rule in this kingdom, but yet the king rarely stayed within his boundaries. 

I am a child whom at 2 years old was molested by one of the kings own boy scouts.  I have experienced so much trauma that I'm blessed to be breathing today, bleeding out of yet another cut on my fingers.

  I am the blood of my ancestors. I am living proof that they lived, and lived hard even as we do today, yet without the modern comforter of the modern age, this as I'm typing this on a handheld device that in the fantasy mind of a 10 year old boy was unfathomable, connected to the world!

As I have walked and talked with the unhoused population of Utah county I have found that I am broken and yet so blessed with what I have.  A home and roof over my head, and too many modern congrats to count.  As my partner has stated so many times of their experience on the street, I feel guilty for having what we have.  The life we live, in a home, atransportion and a job I absolutely love. That in itself is a rarity. 

The conversations I've had with my street family sound somewhat familiar to me.  Family trauma, marital abuse, substances to numb the pain, and the most familiar to me, religious trauma in it's many forms.  I have experienced all of these and so many others I can't list, and this painful human experience is within all of those that call the street home.  

Rant over

After we hopped on the bus we headed to the mall.  We found a spot on the east side of by Maverick. With that spot we had access to a bathroom, which are hard to come by as an unhoused person.  We had water and a bagful of nuts and dried fruit.  We were going to fly a sign!

Flying a sign or what others may deem as panhandling is illegal in most cities.  Provo for instance would ticket you and fine you, once again adding to the poverty of the situation. Orem has a different take on it, it's ok imas long as your not impeding traffic nor just flat out harassing people.  

Our sign was simple, we weren't asking for money it simply stated that we were asking for prayers.  Prayers for the community, to alleviate the problems that we now have in our society.  We are no need of money, just a simple gesture of positive thoughts and Love. 

My partner and I set up at the entrance to the mall on the east side, next to Maverick and Zions bank.  On a Saturday afternoon traffic should be good.  

Even though we only asked for prayer there were those who would donate through monetary means.  Prior to us doing this we knew going in there are those who would wish to donate, those donations would go towards the community, supplies that are needed such as socks, clothes, shoes etc. You can literally go 1 day and somehow things disappear, either through misplacing them or even everything being confiscated by the police.  It happens more often than you think, even if you've done no wrong. 

We spent 2 hours flying our sign.  Water, pizza, snacks and monetary donations were given freely by those who see someone in need.  Good hearted people whom a couple even stopped to have a conversation.  We explained that everything were doing is to bring awareness to the unhoused and the situation in Utah county itself.  

My partner explained to me that because they are female that it's not safe for them to fly a sign by themselves. There are those who would take advantage of the situation of a lone female and awful things could and have happened to those whom can't protect themselves.  Good apples and rotten ones in the human experience.  The rotten ones only see one thing and that is to take advantage of those who can't fight back. 

The monetary donations were donated the next day to the Genesis project in South Provo.  Its a location for a warming center a couple of nights a week.  The pastor has a full time job as a teacher and yet still does what Christ would do, feed my sheep!  A simple gesture of helping those who are hurting, in pain, trauma etc.  A pastor who understands the Pure Love of Christ!

After a couple of hours we refilled our water at Maverick and wet out on our next bus ride to the library.  We took a detour to Smith's to pick up a couple of small items.  

With a backpack and and my partners cart we are not allowed in the store to shop.  I stayed at the front entrance along with my partners bag so they could go in and get some things.  I stood waiting and observing people, some given looks of pity, some of avoidance, where people would go out of their way to not be near me.  I'm in a curious situation where all I have on is a backpack, dressed in my normal every day clothes, only thing that is done is add to my costume.  I frequent this store and have seen the same done to others that look as if they are unhoused as well. 

My partner came back with a small pint of ice cream and we decided to walk down to the Temple grounds instead of the library.  I'm a little tired at this point, considering my schedule is a little backwards and I may be got 4-5 hours of sleep the night before. 

We still had a few hours before we needed to take the bus to the warehouse.  We walked to the Temple and sat on the grass of the lawn in the shade of a sycamore.  Beautiful afternoon with temps in the low to mid 70s.  Both of us are tired and since we can't really nap on the grounds we start to head up to the library where there's are a couple spots that's are shaded and we can lay down for a few mins to nap. 

We hopped on the bus as we did the 1st night and took it to Provo Central.  Similar crowd and similar issues.  I replied to my partner, ' this is repetitious and monotonous'.  Defining insanity that the repeat of the prior day is virtually the same as the today.  No where to go and rest a weary head and if you do you'll be ticketed, too many tickets create warrants, warrants arrests and days, weeks, months and years in jail for just trying to survive. It's a broken system that has enslaved the most vulnerable people, and yet the people are told that they need to get a job, a home or they're just lazy.  

The fact being that most people have severe trauma, mental instability or so many other reasons as to why they make the street a home.  It's unfair and very unkind. 

For a country and especially a City that proclaims freedom there is anything but freedom.  It's a fascist movement afoot in our federal, state and local governments as the anti camping anti human laws passed from above only enslave those whom have no other means to get by.  It's ugly and evil and we call ourselves a Christian nation! Whatever that means? 

Christ stated that whatsoever you do unto the least of these, you do unto me.  This goes not only for humans but for all of creation.  

The pride and vanity of Provo and the inhospitable behavior of those that not only are in a position of leadership but their example is reflected in the public eye.  We live in Babylon, the mother of whores, yet those that do sex work are looked down upon as ugly disgusting people.  My perspective is that Babylon is the mother of governments, organized religions that proclaims that they have Christ in mind when passing laws.  Mammon more like!

With the bus being packed the driver had to tell people at the next stop to wait for the next one as they had a wagon and 2 dogs with them.  
We arrived at the red building 30 minutes prior to it opening.  Once again waiting on the weed infested grass and dirt across the street on state.  I through our my tapestry throw and my partner and I sit until the doors are ready to open.  We didn't want to be cited for trespassing.

As we walk in, sign our names to a sheet of paper and set up, I take my melatonin and step outside mingling with those I had already got to know as well as a few I didn't.  45 min in I'm tired and lay down. 

2 am rolls around and a man yelling and screaming accusing people of stealing his cigarettes.  He was inebriated and angry.  A man and a woman pipe up to shut the fuck up and leave.  This is supposed to be a quiet time, it was not. Arguing from beds until police arrive to remove this man from the building still ranting about someone stealing his smokes.  

My partner and I layed calmly looking at one another during the altercation and kept out heads down and mouths shut. This wasn't a moment to speak up.  

Police arrive and the conversation was the same, they calmly escorted him out without any altercation and the building quieted down.  Still hard to fall back to sleep with the commotion that had just happened.  

In the last couple of months there have been fights breaking out and several incidents like the one that night.  A couple of months ago a woman had an overdose on the floor around where I was sleeping.  My partner was overcome with grief and understandably so.  This woman left behind a note for her children, it was suicide by OD.  

Life is precious, very precious to those of us working with the vulnerable population.  It makes me sad that society has not only forgotten but made those who don't choose, but by circumstances happen to call the street their home.  It's sad that a simple gesture of kindness isn't as abundant as it should be.  

As a younger person I had rose colored glasses on. I thought everyone was like me.  I was naive and innocent not realizing that other will take advantage of you in very cunning ways. I was taken advantage of multiple times throughout my life, even by those I held dear to my heart. How can you hurt someone you proclaim to love?  I still don't know, but I see the masses doing this so often and I don't understand it.  Call it the world, call it whatever you want but being unkind tears your soul.  It's like Voldemort in the Harry Potter series.  You have to do something truly evil to create a horcrux, being cruel splits the soul. 

The wakeup call the next morning was not exactly a way I wanted to awaken.  Luckily I had arisen 20 mins prior to watch the sunrise and use the bathroom before the rush came.  It was a gorgeous morning and this was a day my partner was going to be baptized as a follower of Christ.  

With no bus service for the day a14 passenger van arrived to transport people to The Genesis project.  5 loads later of passengers my partner and I got on and arrived at the church.  

There was breakfast being served by the local seventh-day Adventist Church and donations of coffee juice croissants muffins cereal etc were handed out.  

I sat at a the base of a tree, wrapped in my celtic throw while there were a couple of native people listening to native drums from the Bluetooth.  Very much my vibe, getting me into the Sabbath feel I sat and closed my eyes.  Approached by a man in his early 30s.  Introduced himself as an addict.  I could resonate. He's been 3 weeks clean.  He broke down and cried, told his story about his mental illness, addiction, family, and his precious dog who's been taken from him a couple of months prior.  

Dogs are a protectiona and your closest confidant while your alone on the street.  This man was suffering, he missed his best friend and it made me think of my own dog I had to give up last summer. Very intuitive and friendly and when you needed Benny he'd come sit by you or lay on your feet.  He senses your ailments and just knew you needed him 

This man needed his dog.  I am grateful he spoke with me, even with the little advice I gave it was just him talking.  He needed reassurance and love from a stranger He's just met.  I pray he's ok and that life will change for him.

Genesis is a coma as you are congregation. Come in or stay outside, it's no matter. The pastor is a man of God!  His heart is good and he does his best to understand Christ and the apostles teachings. I have gone several times and it's always a passionate loving message. 

Today was baptism day. My partner has decided a couple of months ago to be baptized as a Christian into the fold.  

It's completely different than my experience as a Mormon, the pomp and circumstance that Mormonism brings into a full change of heart. I personally don't believe that an 8 year old child is of sound mind to make this decision to be baptized let alone know what they are being baptized for.  

I've seen it with my own children that when a kid is 8 its  peer pressure that gets them into the water.  My children were given the choice to be baptized at that age or wait until whenever they feel like it was time. 2 of my boys made the decision to wait until they were 9 to do it.  

As an adult and making the decision to follow the path of Christ was very significant to me.  I was baptized at 8 into Mormonism but years later through my own decisions and path I choose to become baptized as a true follower.  Through study and prayer I made that leap.  That is what my partner was doing as well. 

They had an inflatable hot tub with no bubble going and those who choose to make that decision were baptized.  My partner was in tears and the joyous grin on their face as they came up out of the streaming water washing off the body.  

It was surely a joyous occasion.  They had a couple of friends attend as well as several whom they have gotten to know over the years.  

This marked the end of my 3 days of being homeless. 

No I haven't experienced what it truly takes to make it.  I had good weather and guidance along the way.  I could possibly do this on my own through my own experience in life.  

It marks for an occasion of change in our community, a change not only for survival but a change for good.  

If and when humanity decides to awaken and look beyond themselves in a mind of clarity, see that we do have a huge problem on our hands and it sits as the base level of survival.  Reach out to those less fortunate, donate to a cause that helps those who need it most.  Change takes place within all of us, and within all of us is that simple spark of consciousness that each one of us has.  

We all have a divine spark within, Christ stated it plainly in Matthew 25:45 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me'.  

Simple words, simple actions can change not only ourselves, but that person sitting next to you on the bus, in a restaurant, a gas station and everywhere you look. 

If we change ourselves to become better human beings, we can help those that surround us.  Dignity is lacking in today's culture of depravity and selfishness.   Loving one another is one of the greatest commandments.  It's simple, yet tossed aside for various reasons.  Peace can be found within if you are to love those on the outside. 

Communities will change through service to others, love is in abundance if we simply open our hearts and minds. 

I'd written this next passage a few years ago, at the end of my hell and the beginning of my healing.  What I've always felt when interacting with another human is to just be kind, you never know if your smile allowed that person in their darkest moments to see that glimpse of light from someone who has been in pain and suffering the majority of their life.  My darkest hours were brightened several times in my life by someone who's been in my place.  Love one another and as my generation learned from Bill and Teds always BE EXCELLENT to each other! 


Just Be
Times change, they come and go and are fleeting in a moment.

People come, people go they make a huge impact on your life and sometimes it's in an instant that they are there and then gone.

Focus on what you have, it's precious and should be a cherished moment, every minute of every day.  

The brightness of what's ahead is a time to look forward to, your life, your soul is tied into everything and everyone you come across. 

The little things in life are what matter most, particularly with your friends, your family, your children.   

Focus on your character,  your happiness, make nothing in this world tell you that you can't do anything, because you can do anything, as long as you have the will to do it.  

Live in the Now!  

Now is the time you can be happy!  Now is the time you can change everything!  

The past has is who you were, you can learn from your mistakes and become anything you want to be...

The present is a gift, breathe it in... breathe it out

Life is fleeting, moments are like the wind, ever changing direction.

 Smile at the person you pass by, you don't know where they've been, who they are or where they are going.  You may have just become a bright star in their dead of night.

# What Are Virtual Office Rituals and Traditions? 

In the context of a digital workspace, rituals consult with regular, regularly small, repeatable practices that give a boost to corporation values and convey structure to remote collaboration. Traditions are usually more symbolic or celebratory in nature, marking milestones or shared employer moments. Both rituals and traditions serve to: Anchor groups in a shared identity Promote engagement and morale Reduce the feeling of isolation amongst faraway workers 

# Why They Matter in Virtual Office 

Culture In conventional workplace settings, way of life forms organically via physical proximity—casual hallway chats, impromptu coffee breaks, or shared lunches. Remote paintings lacks those spontaneous encounters. Rituals and traditions help recreate that cultural fabric in digital areas. Some key benefits include: 

**1. Creating a Sense of Belonging** 

Weekly check-ins, virtual “stand-ups,” or Monday morning greetings help employees sense seen and heard. Even a simple “Good Morning” thread on Slack or Teams could make a distinction in reinforcing that everyone is part of the identical community.

**2. Construction stability and stability**

Distance work can feel fragmented without structure. Rituals provide prediction - such as every Friday ends with the ""victory of the week"" discussion - which helps to make the week anchor and provides a mental limit between work and personal life. 

**3. Achievement Traditions** 

such as Virtual Birthday Shaoutouts, Work Anniversary, or Monthly All-Hands with Team Shaoutout help to maintain a positive team spirit. These practices appreciate and remind the team members that they are valuable.

 **4. Strengthen company values**

 If cooperation is a main value, starting meetings with the ""Teamwork Highlight"" can submit that principle subtle. When rituals align with the values ​​of the company, they act as a cultural touchpoint, strengthening the identity of the organization. 

**5. Promote morale and reduce burnout** 

Rituals such as mid-week trivia, digital coffee brakes, or wellness Wednesday have been injected to fun and human connection moments-essential for the good of the employee in the Churchuel setup.

# Conclusion

In the digital field, deliberate rituals and traditions are only more than felt-they are essential tools for the creation of a harmonious and vibrant distance culture. By promoting regular connection points and shared experiences, they help to convert a virtual office into a real community. As business continues to embrace flexible work environment, embeding meaningful rituals in daily tasks would be an important strategy for the cultivation of unity and long -term success.",1,1747376682.0,u_heileyoffices,0,1.0,False

i have friends, best friends too. everything was going fine until this year january, i felt like the best version of myself even though i took a drop year after my 12th grade which i finished in 2024, last year (i'm almost two years younger than all my classmates). anyway, i felt like the best version of myself, but recently i've been feeling so out of place. it's like, i initiate a conversation and then the conversation happens. i haven't talked to my best friends in so long, which makes me wonder if we only ever talked because i initiated the conversation, but i also know it's not true and they care about me. i've been someone who feared loneliness but over the years, i found peace with it. years ago, i'd be afraid to walk into a coffee shops, movie theaters, etc alone but now i prefer going by myself. i started enjoying my own company. i get attached to people easily but recently i've been letting go the people not worth having in my life anymore. as this part of me grows, i also stopped taking it personally whenever I drifted apart with someone. i used to feel like a part of people's life, but right now i feel like an addition to it. that i'm the only one hanging onto friendships, and it gets me to a point where i just wanna cut everyone off and sit back and see who comes back. i feel like that's a toxic trait of mine, but i'm really not sure what to do in this situation. i feel like i belong nowhere.

my parents seperated last year, i live with my mom in this city and my dad is a whole state away, i have two houses but no home. i have people, but i still feel alone. i don't feel upset to be exact, but i'm just out here thinking if all this is really worth it. at this point, even I'm not sure what i'm talking about. i feel so lost and i wanna get away from everyone and start a new life. i've never really been close with my parents and i'm waiting to leave for college. i know noone lasts forever, but why do i even feel like an addition to the people who care about me? why do i have the need to isolate myself? why do i feel like i don't deserve anything? why do i feel the need to wake up next morning and pretend everything's fine? i don't had a problem with my own company, so why do i feel this way? i know i'll be fine regardless.

if there is one person i don't feel this way around, it's my man. he always makes me feel valued but sometimes i wonder if i'm an addition to his life too. if he's a lot better off.. without me. it breaks me, but the thought stays. i want him to go out there, do better but he chooses to be with me everyday. that's sweet of him, but it's so hard to see why he would stick with me when i can't even stick with myself. i don't see a reason. it's like i have noone to run to and nowhere to go. the inevitable feeling of loneliness is there, and i wouldn't be devastated if i was lonely, but i just wanna stop feeling like an addition to people's lives i'm already a part of.

my guy is there with me whenever i need him, but i also hesitate to tell him things because I don't even make sense to myself. i'm not sure how to start off this conversation, i'm not sure how to describe what i feel, i'm not sure about anything. ",1,1747376323.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
