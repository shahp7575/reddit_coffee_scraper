I've attached some photos of different grind levels ranging from 30-110, I don't have an espresso machine yet so I haven't played around with the lower burr settings yet though. 

 I've only had it for about a week at this point, but if anyone has any questions I'll do my best to answer them.

It has plagued me for years, and I had to have a cystoscopy with fulguration of the ulcers back in October. I looked into a study done in the UK on Lactoferrin supplements, and it was incredibly promising. I bought some on Amazon and have been taking them every day (I’ve skipped a few admittedly), and I have seen SUCH a difference!!! I’m drinking caffeine again (I know it’s bad), but my bladder feels 96% normal after drinking even COFFEE!!!

My vitamin D levels were really low at the doctor, so I’ve taken vitamin D and lactoferrin each day after breakfast and with a glass of water. I’m telling you, it has seriously worked for me. And I know it isn’t placebo, because I’ve been in chronic pain.

Visiting Las Vegas 

Business owner. Calm energy with a playful side.

I run my own transportation company, so yes — I’m responsible, organized, and very good at keeping things moving. I love good conversation, easy laughter, and people who know how to be confident without being loud.

For transparency: still married on paper, but very much living my own life.

I’m low-drama, curious, and enjoy connections that feel relaxed, fun, and natural.

If you’re steady, kind, and know how to flirt and communicate, we’ll probably get along just fine 😉 If this sounds like your vibe, send me a DM with a picture and let’s grab a coffee.

But here's what nobody talks about: most of us have zero clue what that actually means. We confuse butterflies with compatibility, chemistry with safety, and obsession with love. I spent years studying relationship psychology through books, research papers, and endless podcasts because I was tired of the recycled garbage advice. What I found? The traits that make someone ""right"" for you are wildly different from what rom-coms sell us.

This isn't about Selena and Benny specifically. It's about understanding what actually creates lasting love instead of another painful breakup. The good news is that recognizing these patterns isn't rocket science once you know what to look for.

**Look for emotional consistency, not just passion**

Everyone loves the highs. The late night texts. The can't keep your hands off each other phase. But real compatibility shows up when things get boring or hard. Does this person show up consistently? Are they emotionally available on random Tuesday afternoons, not just when everything's perfect?

Research from the Gottman Institute (they've studied couples for over 40 years) shows that successful relationships aren't about grand gestures. They're about small, consistent moments of connection. The person who remembers your coffee order. Who asks about your shitty day at work. Who doesn't disappear when you're anxious or struggling.

**They make you feel SAFE to be yourself**

Not the filtered, Instagram version of yourself. The messy, occasionally annoying, sometimes insecure real you. According to attachment theory research by Dr. Sue Johnson (creator of Emotionally Focused Therapy), feeling safe with a partner is THE foundation for lasting love. 

Can you ugly cry in front of them? Can you admit when you're wrong? Can you share your weirdest thoughts without judgment? If you're constantly performing or walking on eggshells, that's not ""the one."" That's anxiety with good sex.

**""Attached: The New Science of Adult Attachment""** by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller breaks this down perfectly. This book will make you question everything you think you know about dating. It explains why you keep choosing the wrong people and what secure attachment actually looks like. The authors are psychiatrists who translate complicated research into super practical advice. Reading this changed how I view every relationship.

**They challenge you WITHOUT trying to change you**

There's a difference. The right person encourages growth. They believe in your potential. But they're not constantly criticizing you or making you feel like you're not enough as you are right now.

Esther Perel talks about this brilliantly in her podcast ""Where Should We Begin?"" She works with real couples and you hear actual therapy sessions. It's fascinating and uncomfortable and so insightful. You realize that healthy relationships require both acceptance AND growth, not one or the other.

**Your nervous system actually CALMS DOWN around them**

This is huge and most people miss it. We're trained to think love should feel electric and intense 24/7. But according to [polyvagal theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvagal_theory) (sounds fancy, basically it's how our nervous system responds to relationships), the right person should help regulate your nervous system.

Do you sleep better when they're around? Do you feel more grounded? Or are you constantly anxious, checking your phone, analyzing every text? Your body knows the truth before your brain does.

The Finch app actually helped me track my emotional patterns in relationships. It's a self care app with a little bird companion, sounds childish but it makes you check in daily with your feelings. I started noticing I felt MORE anxious with people I thought I loved, and calmer with people I initially dismissed as ""boring.""

For anyone wanting to go deeper into relationship patterns without spending hours reading, there's this personalized learning app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been pretty helpful. It pulls from relationship psychology books, research papers, and expert insights to create custom audio content based on what you're actually struggling with.

You can tell it something specific like ""understand why I'm attracted to emotionally unavailable people"" or ""build secure attachment as someone with anxious tendencies,"" and it generates a structured learning plan just for that. The depth is adjustable too, so you can do a quick 15-minute overview or go into a 40-minute deep dive with real examples when something really resonates. The voice options are honestly kind of addictive (there's this smoky, calm one that's perfect for evening listening). Makes it way easier to actually internalize this stuff while commuting or doing laundry instead of just collecting books you never finish.

**They're willing to do the WORK**

Relationships aren't effortless. Anyone selling you that fantasy is lying. The right person doesn't run when things get difficult. They're willing to have hard conversations. Go to therapy. Read books. Actually change behaviors that hurt you.

""Hold Me Tight"" by [Dr. Sue Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Johnson) is incredible for understanding how to actually communicate in relationships. She explains why we fight and how to break destructive patterns. The book is based on decades of research but written like she's talking directly to you. It's the kind of book that makes you want to highlight every other sentence.

**You can build a LIFE together, not just good dates**

Do your values actually align? Not just ""we both like dogs"" but like, real shit. Money. Kids. Where you want to live. How you handle conflict. What family means to you. 

It's boring to talk about but these mismatches destroy relationships. Chemistry fades. Shared values don't. The right person wants to build something WITH you, not just enjoy the honeymoon phase.

**They've done their own healing work**

You can't be someone's therapist. The right person takes responsibility for their own trauma, insecurities, and patterns. They're self aware. They apologize when they're wrong. They don't blame all their problems on their ex or their childhood.

Everyone has baggage. But are they actively unpacking it or just bringing it into your relationship?

Look, there's no perfect checklist. But if someone makes you feel safe, seen, and excited about the future? If your nervous system relaxes instead of constantly firing? If they show up consistently and do the work? That's probably someone worth keeping around.

Most importantly, ""the one"" should make you feel like the best version of yourself. Not because they complete you (you're not a half person) but because they see you fully and choose you anyway. That's the real shit nobody puts in the rom coms.",1,1770395483.0,MenInModernDating,0,1.0,False

I've gained 70 lbs, she doesn't like sex, and wife isn't willing to change. She has to be forced to change due to circumstances.","Names, dates, details, and professions redacted or modified for privacy.

  
My wife and I have been together for 8 years and married for 5. We have two very young children, major financial issues that are under control but highly stressful. Our sex life was dead until about a month ago and it's definitely dead again starting today.  
  
When I met my wife, she was fat. 260 lbs at 5'4. I was 199 lbs and I was 6'0 but now I'm 270 and 5'10.5. I can't believe I've put on so much weight. I feel like a giant sack of sh!t all the time. It's hard to move and I've been in and out of the hospital multiple times in the last 3 years with back problems and gut problems that I only recently got.

  
She was really into sub play (BDSM) but wasn't too serious about the kind of play, more so that she just wanted to be degraded like in the books she likes to read. She has a lot of books about sex and monsters. Obviously I loved her so I tried to play dom but I didn't care for it much. She'd only been with two other guys (that she's willing to admit) and both of them were apparently terrible at it. She'd visit once a week and we'd do date night, have sex, go to bed, wake up and do breakfast dates, then it would be a week. It was a good relationship. But she would never do oral sex, or let me do oral sex on her. I also found out she never masturbates.

We moved in together. She had never lived alone before and her mother did everything for her. I did most of the household chores in the beginning. I cooked, cleaned, did my own laundry, maintained the yard, the cars, and finances. We started having sex two or three times a week. We got married. She stopped being interested in sex and started just doing duty sex about once a month. It was fine but I was frustrated. We were both busy working. We fought about chores a lot. I said a lot of stuff like ""We're married, you don't have sex with me and I take care of everything in the house except laundry. Why do you get to yell at me about the dishes not being done yet?"" Finally I got an answer out of her about why she didn't like having sex, and she admitted she got too sore from having sex with me and it made her day harder. So I bought toys, lube, and started working on techniques. She definitely enjoyed this more, but it still made her sore, so she asked me to stop.

I was frustrated and considering leaving her over it at this point. After all, I was doing 80% of everything and if we're not sexually compatible, how can we stay married to each other? But then I got a new job, and we started making more money. So some of our financial problems were solved and I made a change: ""From now on, you're cooking dinner and doing dishes."" And she agreed.

Of course, she didn't know how to cook though. I had to teach her. Over the course of 6 months. And then we started having sex more. And then she got pregnant. And that's when she decided that it was my turn to cook and do dishes again.

Then, we did something that actually helped our marriage: we moved into a bigger place. With room for my hobbies and her hobbies, and the baby. We had a bunch of sex for about a month, and then again, we have dead bedroom.

I continued to do all those chores, albeit ignoring the yard because it's so much bigger and I just don't have time. But now she had to take care of a baby, and the baby's laundry. Which is apparently as hard as doing everything I'm doing. Of course, I am also responsible for putting the baby to sleep every night, and doing half the feeds (""that's fair""), on top of everything else I was already doing. And tbf, it's not like pumping milk and carrying around full breasts all day is easy, either. I'm sympathetic to this issue. This went on for a year.

And then, the thing that actually put things into perspective for her was baby #2.

See, now when I was putting baby #2 to bed, she had to watch baby #1 without help. And baby #1 is a mischievous little girl that will climb on anything and get into anything. So while I am ""doing my share,"" wife is chasing around a toddler trying to keep her from getting into the glassware, and the chocolate, and drawing on the walls. She's so exhausted, that even mentioning sex pisses her off. And at this point I ask why, and she says: ""I haven't got any sleep in months because of the babies!""

""I can help you with that.""

And for the first time, my wife lets me perform oral sex on her. She loves it. She sleeps like a rock. The next morning: ""That's the best I've slept in months.""

""Let me know next time you need it.""

And she never asked. Until Christmas.

""Honey, it's Christmas. I want to have sex with my wife today.""  
""Only if you do that thing I like first.""  
""ok.""

We proceed to do it in that order. The sex is much better. She actually enjoys it!

And then she breaks her wedding ring on the coffee table from flailing during sex. Because of course she does.

So I buy her a new wedding band and engagement ring with a big rock on it. I want her to be rewarded for enjoying sex with me and to think about me more often. We then have sex every day for a month (except her time of the month). She finally recognizes that she can enjoy sex and that I am willing to do what she needs to enjoy it.

Here's the problem though.

I'm full of resentment. Every time I make a dinner or do a dish, all I am thinking is ""Why am I doing this? I need to do X first."" And my wife is in the other room on her phone looking at Tik Tok. I'm so f\*\*\*ing tired of being the mother of my household. It's exhausting. Do you know what it's like to manage an entire other person's paperwork on top of your own, while also doing literally everything for everyone else? I make a meal for 4 people. Set the table for 2 adults, a toddler, and a baby. Put the kids in their seats, strapped in, with bibs. Toddler wants to eat something else. Mommy is on Tik Tok. Washing machine goes off. ""Honey, can you move those to the dryer?"" While she's on Tik Tok. Wife gets home while I'm in the middle of cooking and setting the table. ""Don't you want to ask me about my day?"" Every single day for months, this goes on. While I'm not even getting laid, my fat bitch of a wife has the audacity to ask me to do even more sh!t on top of the regular sh!t I do, and she just sits around and watches Tik Tok and wonders why I don't talk to her the moment she gets home. But somehow, she's more exhausted than I am. How does that work?

Then I look down at my own fat ass and realize that *I'm* the problem.

I keep letting my wife get away with taking advantage of me. It's costing me my health. And she doesn't respect me for it.

How do I know?

Last night, after the kids were asleep earlier than normal, she asked me to run to the grocery store and buy her a sandwich for tomorrow's lunch. I told her ""sure, let's have sex now. Then we can have sex again when I get back."" (This is after a month of us actually enjoying having sex with each other, for the first time in two years, and really the first time since being married).

""No, how about just when you get back?""

""Why not?""

""I'll be too sore.""

""Ok what if you just gave me a handjob"" (something else she's never done)

Then she walks away and pretends like she didn't hear me. So I call her on the phone, and she ignores me several times.

Then she walks back to me and sits down. So I ask her, ""hey why did you walk away from me when I asked that?""

""I don't want a sandwich anymore. I'll just get something else.""

Now I've realized 5 things that absolutely destroyed me:

My wife does not want a playful, sexually active marriage where we have sex because the moment presents itself.  
My wife is actually only having sex with me because she sleeps better.  
My wife does not find me attractive. But the only thing that's changed about me negatively, is that I've gained 70 pounds.  
My wife is over 100 pounds overweight. I gleefully perform oral sex on her. She doesn't want to touch my sex organs.  
My wife only cares about receiving attention, not giving it.

  
I only told her the first point here. And she got up and walked away again.

Hey Chicago! I just moved to the city and am trying to make more friends, especially people to hang out with, explore the city, grab coffee, do activities, etc. 

I follow letsbefriendschi on Instagram and really love how active and welcoming that community is.

Are there other Instagram pages, groups, or local communities focused on making friends in Chicago that you’d recommend? Especially anything similar in vibe to letsbefriendschi (inclusive, social events, chill vibes).

My husband keeps telling me to just go work at the school, he keeps yelling at me, he says it’s not worth it.’

It sounds like something you do online, like you go live, and the more comments you get the more money you make. Sounds like you go live in the morning, and in the evening.

To stay and be tolerably unhappy, or go and find a man who isn’t so passive?","I would love everyone’s perspective on this. Tbh, I really wish I knew about red pill younger, if I was younger like 25 I think I’d leave in a heartbeat. But I have very low hopes for dating at my now age (28) and feel like I have no time anyways. 

My partner and I have been together for 10 years and works in a very niche field. For the past 2 years until now, we lived with his parents. My parents were separated and living together and my mom started demanding rent that was a little much for me, and I also didn’t want to pay rent to someone nearly abusing me. Anyways, I wanted to get our own place but we lived in NJ and he kept turning down each place we could afford and calling it a dump. Then he saw a job in Texas at a top company (think google) making almost 15k more. I told him to apply not really thinking he’d get it. He did and it was horrible, I cried, said I didn’t want to live, begged him to stay and even said I’d shut up and be fine with living with his in laws now. We were given 1.5 months to move there. It was a really rough time for us, he said he was going no matter what, it would be good for us, and I went anxiety meds for panic attacks and barely ate. 

I am extremely close with my sister, and she also has MH issues, so leaving her was and is awful. I miss her almost daily and even facetime isn’t the same. The other issue is the weather and political climate here. I love love the snow and colder weather, I can’t imagine living somewhere it never snows like here. And also the fact that I just love NJ and want to be there. 

  
Now here’s the catch, because his job is so niche the only other options are CA (way too far) and Buffalo NY, which is still like 8 hours from NJ. So I just feel like there’s no happy ending for me here in terms of living situations, and I hate how limited we are, but I’m 28. Not early 20s. The hypotheticals also concern me. He also said he’d try to provide for me and I expressed wanting to be a SAHM especially when they are young, but then he also says if I don’t pay anything toward the mortgage I won’t be on it. I’ve asked him to try to change his job to an adjacent field so we can have more flexibility and he said he can’t. 

  
Relationship: pros: Okay sex life except its on his terms not mine - I wish he was more vocal and kinky - he tries a bit, takes care of the house (not a lazy man at all), kind, pays for all dinners and food when we’re together. cons: very passive, not a talker and not good at reassurance or emotional support;if am hurting he doesn’t check in - and yes I’ve asked him to , not super attracted to him all the time: he’s okay looking but not really my type, he isn’t ugly but wouldn’t catch my eye but grew on me; not very masculine: his friends are visiting this weekend and they were talking really loud, I had work the next day and asked him if he could ask them to be quieter, he said no they are our guests and that he could sleep through it until I begged him to text them - I worry how he’d be when I’m pregnant or we have kids if he puts others before me now;  MONEY: I mentioned the mortgage  hypothetical, but one week I had my period bad and fell back on house work and he said I’d need to pay more rent if I wasn’t caring for house (we pay 64% him and around 40% me); he’s also named called me before and when I originally wanted to move out of his parents he said I was financially illiterate to want to spend money on rent. doesn‘t surprise me at all, doesn’t plan dates, if I ask him to pick me up a coffee when he is out grocery shopping or running errands (he doesn’t do this alone often) he never does. 

All this being said, I think he’d be an okay dad, but I think i’d be emotionally neglected and lonely, if we had problems with his mom who can be feisty I probably would have to see boundaries and do the talking, I’d probably need to advocate for myself.

the copy that worked best was crazy short like only 29 words

Hey, What if you could pull unlimited lead lists for less than your coffee budget?

Want a quick sneak peek?

P.S. We onboarded Cold IQ, Scale Topia, Outbound Consulting

Thats the whole thing and no long list of features and no ""our game changing solution""

Just one question and an easy ask

Why this hit

1. Short emails win

Tested longer versions at 70 words, 100 words, even 150 words but this tiny 29 word one beat all of them

reason is simple because people are busy and they skim through emails fast and if you cant get your point across in under 30 words you are asking for attention you didnt earn yet

2. dont reveal everything upfront

most people want to explain their whole offer in the first email so the reader gets it but thats the wrong move because the only job of email one is to make them curious enough to reply and if you spill everything right away then there is no reason for them to respond

""unlimited lead lists for less than coffee budget"" gives a taste of the value but doesnt explain how it works so they need to reply to find out and thats exactly what you want

3. make replying super easy

didnt ask them to hop on a call or block 15 minutes on their calendar because big asks early on kill your chances

just said ""want a quick sneak peek?"" because when you ask for something small people say yes more often and you can always move to a call once they show interest

4. mention names people know

putting Cold IQ, Scale Topia and Outbound Consulting in the PS line helped a lot as people in the cold email world know these names so seeing them adds trust right away

if you dont have famous clients yet then give something away for free like a sample list or a quick audit and just give them a good reason to hit reply

most people make email one way too complicated and they try to explain everything, handle objections and prove they are legit all at once

forget all that and just make them curious enough to reply

once they respond then you share more details as email one is only about getting them to raise their hand

hey everyone, figured i’d share some parking tips for the jackie hill perry event on 02/07. trilith is a cool spot but parking can be a headache, especially getting out if you don't plan ahead.  
  
honestly, your absolute best bet to avoid the main $15 deck traffic and save some cash is to check out Prked. it's an app where people rent out their driveways and garages right in the town at trilith neighborhood, super close to the venue. it's almost always way cheaper than the venue's price and lets you skip the massive bottleneck trying to exit the main parking deck later. short walk, zero traffic drama.  
  
now for the official options: trilith live does have its own paid parking deck adjacent to the facility, which is a big parking choice. the entrance is at 130 shepperton way. they charge $15 for this deck and it is subject to availability, so you might want to consider buying a prepaid parking pass online if you want the security, which you can usually find through ticket sites. it saves you a little stress on event day.  
  
the good news is that there is also plenty of free parking in other lots around the town at trilith, all within walking distance of trilith live. these are first-come, first-served, so if you're aiming for a free spot, you need to arrive early, maybe an hour or two before the 7:00 pm showtime to grab dinner or coffee and secure one of those spots.  
  
if you're driving an electric vehicle, there are also ev charging stations at the trilith studios parking deck on 125 shepperton wy that offer free parking while you charge (it's $0.20/kwh for the juice). that's a nice little perk if you need a top-off.  
  
finally, the trilith guesthouse offers daily valet parking for $12 for up to 4 hours if you’re looking for a slightly more upscale option, or it's complimentary for two hours if you're eating at one of their dining spots. this is a good option if you want to grab an early dinner nearby.  
  
hope this helps everyone get in and out smoothly on 02/07!",1,1770394652.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

I was one of those lucky rebound fatigue people. I was EXHAUSTED, sleepy, brain dead for weeks.

I'm approximately back to pre-cpap baseline, but without the sense of adrenaline keeping me functioning when I need it... Now if I don't have the best sleep, no amount of coffee or rallying can get me into motion.

I've seen a few questions floating around about how to actually get started on [**Desiree.io**](https://desiree.io/), the site where you can chat with interactive AI models. The signup/payment flow can be a little confusing at first glance, especially if you just want to test the waters. Here's a dead-simple, step-by-step breakdown.

**Quick Disclaimer:** [Desiree.io](https://desiree.io/) features adult-oriented AI companions. You must be 18+.

# Step-by-Step Login & Free Access Guide

1. **Get to the Homepage:** Go to [**https://desiree.io**](https://desiree.io/). You'll see a grid of different AI models.

1. **Choose a Model:** Browse and click on any model you like. This will open their specific ""room"" or chat page.

1. **The Payment Screen (Here's the Key Part):** You will immediately see a payment/access screen with options like ""Daily,"" ""Weekly,"" etc.
   * **LOOK FOR THE ""FREE"" OPTION.** It's usually at the top or very clearly marked. Click the **""Free""** button/plan. This grants you a limited number of free messages to try the model.

# Want to Unlock Everything? A Dollar Goes a Long Way.

The free messages give you a taste, but the platform's real depth comes with full access. If you enjoy the free chat and want to try **all the features**—like longer conversations, different model modes, image generation, etc.—I highly recommend topping up just a little.

**Here's the best value-for-testing tip:** Instead of jumping into a pricey subscription right away:

1. Go to your **Account Dashboard** (click your profile icon).
2. Look for **""Add Credits""** or **""Wallet.""**
3. **Use Lightning Network (Bitcoin) if you can.** Often, you can make **micro-transactions**. Try adding **$1 worth of credits** (or the equivalent in satoshis).
   * Why? This small credit purchase typically **unlocks full features** across all models for a short period (often 24 hours), letting you explore everything the site has to offer without a recurring subscription.

You get to experience the full, uncapped AI for a day for literally the price of a coffee. It's the best way to decide if a longer subscription is worth it for you.

**TL;DR:** Go to site -> Pick model -> Choose **""FREE""** plan on payment screen -> Login with Google -> Chat. To truly test **all features**, add $1 via **Lightning Network** credits from your dashboard for a full-access trial period.

Have fun exploring, and be kind to your AI! They're surprisingly responsive.",1,1770394493.0,DesireeAI,0,1.0,False

I’m looking for a **casual blind date** this Valentine’s. Coffee, food, a walk, and good conversation. Nothing serious, just vibes.

**Non-negotiables (pls read):**

Has to be a straight guy (yes im a girl, dw)

Date must be **within the NUST campus** (for safety reasons)

Not from my department pls… too many uncles there 💀 (I'm from smme)

Has to bring **flowers** (it *is* Valentine’s, come on)

Respectful, normal, and around uni age (around 20-ish is perfect)

If this sounds fun, DM me with a short intro about yourself (dept + year is enough).  
Worst case: we get a funny Valentine’s story. Best case: we actually enjoy it! 

It will be on the 14th of Feb ofc, and you have to dress nicely. 

If you're tall, have curly hair and know how to humour me, I'd appreciate it even more! 

ALSO, this is not a troll or a scam!! need genuine and serious guys to slide to hmu.

1qxltt5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qxltt5,Uptick in labs after stopping period- any recommendations for that or provider?,"Hi I’m 38, compound heterozygous C282Y H63D. I have had crippling periods and have just been diagnosed with endometriosis late last year via a surgical laparoscopy, and my ob gyn is having me take a progesterone only BC and skip periods to get my life back. She literally doesn’t want me to stop until I’m menopause age. It’s been amazing but now 4 months later I did a fasting blood draw to check my levels and it is not great.

TIBC 311 ug/dl (normal)

UIBC 78 ug/dl (low)

Iron 237 ug/dl (high)

Iron saturation 76% (high)

Ferritin 76 ng/ml (normal)

I’m so afraid to have a period again but that is the only way I can think of to get these levels down even though it’s guaranteed to take me out for days. I do not think I weigh enough to give blood. I’m 5’4 and am usually underweight despite my best efforts. On average I’m 105-107 lbs (Filipino / Irish) but I found out during my surgery weigh in I was only 96 lbs which is crazy underweight for me - I believe because last year was extremely stressful for me at work (actively bullied, that person is gone now thankfully since last month). I can’t think of another reason and other than hemochromatosis related values my bloodwork is great. I have been seeing a dietician and eating like it’s my job to the point of it being exhausting and after months I just got back to 100 lbs. I had a endoscopy and colonoscopy in June 2025 and despite my extensive history of GI issues I have a perfect bill of health and they do not think my weight loss has anything to do with the health of my GI system. 

I have seen a hematologist’s PA once who said my case was not serious enough to see the actual hematologist unless my ferritin only is over 150 which has only happened once when I had the flu and was not at all worried about my higher saturation, which greatly concerns me. They do not recommend phlebotomy unless I hit that 150 ferritin level. My gastroenterologist also says she only cares about ferritin and to disregard all other values and that I shouldn’t be worried about being compound heterozygous.

History: ulcerative colitis since I was 13ish (in remission), IBS, hyper mobile elhers danlos syndrome, endometriosis

I live in Portland OR. Does anyone live around here and have a hematologist or gastroenterologist that takes saturation seriously? I have Regence BCBS of Oregon. Is there anything else I can be doing other than manually removing blood to get these numbers down? I only drink coffee/ tea with breakfast or with meals I know might be higher in iron (red meat). I am sensitive to caffeine so I will do decaf coffee if it’s dinner with red meat etc and I tend to only eat a small amount to be careful. I have read on here that tea and coffee can help inhibit absorption. I do drink alcohol a 2-3 times a month, 2-3 drinks at a time. My GI doctor and hematologist PA said I can drink alcohol a couple times a month no problem. I did abstain for months right after my diagnosis out of fear and they both said I was being too anxious and I can enjoy that and red meat in moderation. But now that I’m not having a period, I don’t think that advice is probably indicated anymore.

Any advice or recommendations is appreciated. Obviously I’m freaked out 🥲. I just don’t want organ damage. ",1,1770394287.0,Hemochromatosis,1,1.0,False

What i’ve noticed is that on those bad nights, every tiny sound feels amplified,like my brain is tuned too high, even though my body is tired.

So is caffeine actually the culprit...Or does it just make an already-sensitive system easier to trigger?

My suitcase is full of coffee, and my mouth is full of teeth that cost me about a third of what I was quoted back home.

If you’ve been following my stories, you know I was stressing about this ""dental vacation"" idea. Getting major work done is scary enough, but doing it in another country? I had my doubts. But after 7 days in Colombia, I’m a total convert. Here is how my ""glow-up"" week actually went down.

# Why I Pulled the Trigger

Let’s be real: my local quote for veneers and some restorative work was basically the price of a mid-sized SUV. I did some digging, found an incredible clinic in Medellín, and realized I could get world-class care, a round-trip flight, and a week in a luxury Airbnb for way less than just the dental bill at home.

# My 7-Day Playbook

* **Days 1–2: The Deep Dive.** I landed and went straight to the clinic. I was expecting something ""medical,"" but this place looked like a tech startup. We did 3D scans and a digital mock-up where I literally got to ""approve"" my new smile on a screen before they even touched a tooth.



* **Days 3–5: Work & Wander.** While the lab was custom-making my veneers, I had some downtime. I spent my mornings at the clinic and my afternoons riding the cable cars over the city and drinking way too much world-class espresso. (Pro tip: Medellín is steep—wear good shoes!)



* **Day 6: The Grand Finale.** The big day. I spent a few hours in the chair getting everything bonded. When I finally looked in the mirror? No ""chicklet"" teeth, no fake-looking white. Just a natural, bright version of me.



* **Day 7: The Final Polish.** A quick visit to check my bite and make sure everything felt 100%. I spent the rest of the day showing off my new smile at a rooftop restaurant before heading to the airport.

**The Verdict:** 10/10. I didn't just save a fortune; I actually had a blast. But—and this is a big *but*—you have to do your homework. I spent weeks vetting my doctor.

  
How to Make Sure Your Clinic is Legit

If you’re thinking about doing this, don't just book the first place you see on Instagram. Here is the ""Alex-approved"" checklist of questions to ask before you buy a plane ticket:

**1. Qualifications & Accreditations**

* Are your dentists board-certified, and can I see their credentials/specialties?
* Is the clinic accredited by international bodies (like the ADA, AACD, or local equivalents like the Colombian Dental Federation)?

**2. Technology & Materials**

* What brands of materials do you use for implants or veneers? (Look for names like Straumann, Zimmer, or E.max).
* Do you have an in-house lab, or do you outsource the work?

**3. Logistics & Aftercare**

* What is your 'guarantee' policy if a crown or veneer fails once I’m back home?
* Do you provide a detailed treatment plan and a breakdown of costs in writing before I arrive?
* How many days do I *strictly* need to be in the city for this specific procedure?

**4. Communication**

* Do the doctors and staff speak fluent English (or my native language)?
* Can I speak directly with the dentist via a video call before I book?

If you’re looking to skip the DIY research headache, just head over to [**Thehealthytreatment.com**](http://Thehealthytreatment.com) and hit ""Request a Quote."" They’ve already done the heavy lifting by vetting certified dentists on their platform.

It’s super transparent—you can browse reviews for each doctor and compare prices side-by-side to find a fit for your budget. Plus, you can even hop on a **Video Consultation** to get a feel for your dentist before you ever book a flight.",1,1770393952.0,DentalVeneersColombia,0,1.0,False

hey folks, figured i'd share some parking advice for the colonials game this saturday, 02/07, at 7:00 pm. clearview arena hockey is honestly super fun, but the one real pain is getting on and especially off neville island, which is where the rmu island sports center sits. it's not the cost of parking you worry about, since all rmu athletic events offer free parking for fans, it's the traffic backing up on grand avenue when everyone leaves at once.  
  
first thing, i gotta mention Prked. it's the app for renting driveways or garages right next to the rmu island sports center. even though official parking is free, paying a little on Prked is the best way to skip the official lot congestion and guarantee yourself a spot that lets you bypass the main lot's internal traffic line for a super fast jump onto the road when the game ends. the walk is literally nothing, and it saves you from the island bottleneck hassle.  
  
the main and official way to go is the ample free parking available on-site at the rmu island sports center surface lots. they have a decent amount of space, and the lot is right outside the main entrance of clearview arena, which is super convenient for the short walk in.  
  
the biggest tip i can give if you go with the free on-site lot is all about timing. the arena only seats about 1,200 people, but access is via i-79 or the yellow belt onto grand avenue, and that's where you'll hit traffic, both before and after the game. for a 7:00 pm puck drop, honestly aim to be on neville island by 6:15 pm. being early lets you snag a close free spot and miss the main traffic wave coming over the bridge right before the game.  
  
don't bother looking for street parking near the complex- it's on a sports center property, so it's not a real option like it is in the city.  
  
if you park in the main free lots, remember that getting off neville island right after the final horn can be a slow crawl. your best problem avoidance move- and this is a great insider strategy- is to hang out at the icehouse bistro for a bit and let the initial wave of cars clear out instead of sitting in the exit line. they have coffee and pub fare there, so it's a good place to wait it out.

Kate’s temporary quarters. 

Fresh from the shower, Kate stood in front of the small mirror, toweling the last damp strands from her hair. She pulled it back into a neat, low ponytail—practical, shipboard style—then slipped into a clean uniform blouse and trousers jacket with a patch depicting Earth with lettering at the bottom saying liaison “ Clara most likely “ . The fabric of the highest quality , reminiscent of the uniform that Commander Redford was wearing. She glanced at the chrono: still thirty minutes before she was due at Clara’s quarters.

The door chime sounded—soft, polite.

“Enter,” Kate called.

The panel slid aside. Declan stepped through, already in crisp duty blacks, posture straight but not rigid. His expression was calm, professional, almost carefully neutral.

“Lt. Hill,” he said with a small nod. “Princess Clara “ I was  assigned as your escort while you’re aboard. Wherever you go, I go.”

Kate tilted her head, studying him. “So… you’re my shadow now?”

“Something like that.” A faint, wry quirk touched the corner of his mouth. “Orders are orders.”

She crossed her arms, amused. “If I go to Wyatt’s quarters later?”

Declan’s ears flushed an unmistakable red. He cleared his throat once. “I’ll… wait in the corridor. Discreetly.” Or in the common area depending on the circumstances, 

Kate laughed—quiet, genuine. “Relax, Declan. I’m not going to make you stand guard like a medieval squire.”

He exhaled through his nose, the tension easing a fraction. “Appreciated.”

She picked up her tablet from the table. “We should head to Clara’s, then.”

They stepped into the corridor together. The night-cycle amber had given way to brighter daylight simulation; the ship felt alive again, crew moving with purpose.

As they walked, Kate glanced sideways at him. “Are you married, Declan? Or is there a girlfriend waiting somewhere planetside?”

“No to both,” he answered evenly.

She waited a beat, then added lightly, “Anyone on the ship catch your eye?”

Declan’s stride didn’t falter, but his silence stretched just long enough to be an answer. His jaw tightened—barely noticeable.

Kate smiled to herself. Message received.

They reached Clara’s quarters. The door parted at their approach.

Kate stepped inside first, Declan a respectful half-step behind.

To the right, a very soft voice greeted her.

“Good afternoon, Lt. Hill. It’s glad to see you.”

Kate turned. Clara stood near the low table, dressed in a simple tunic rather than full regalia, her expression warm and open. Cynthia lounged against the holo-viewport sill, arms crossed, already wearing a smirk.

Kate walked forward. Declan moved silently to take position just inside the door, to the left—classic guard stance.

Kate paused, glanced back at him, then addressed the room with perfect seriousness.

“Sir Declan, Princess Clara, Lady Cynthia… we’re about to discuss women things. Gossip. Possibly embarrassing details. Would you like to stay and listen, or would you prefer to wait outside?”

Declan blinked once. Then, without a word, he executed a crisp about-face and marched back into the corridor. The door hissed shut behind him.

Clara’s lips twitched. “Poor man never stood a chance.”

Cynthia snorted. “He’ll survive. Probably.”

Clara gestured to the cushioned seats around the table. “Sit, Kate. I have the paperwork ready.”

A slim folder waited—official seals already glowing faintly in holographic relief. Kate skimmed the top page as she settled.

“You’ll retain your Earth Navy rank—Lieutenant—and serve as permanent liaison to the Nori Navio,” Clara explained. “Full integration, full privileges. No expiration.”

Kate nodded slowly, then looked up. “There’s one addition I’d like.”

Clara raised an elegant brow. “Go on.”

“When Wyatt visits Newtown—whenever that happens—I’d like Leo, Reyes, and Sir Declan to accompany him. He’s called them his friends. I want them there with him.”

Clara considered it for a long moment, then inclined her head. “Reasonable. I see no issue.” A small, shrewd smile curved her lips. “But it will cost you.”

Kate laughed outright. “Name your price, Princess.”

Clara leaned forward slightly. “Name your second daughter after me.”

Kate’s eyes widened—then sparkled. “First.”

Cynthia barked a delighted laugh. “Wait—wait—”

Kate turned to her, grinning. “And the second one after you, Cynthia.”

Cynthia went instantly hysterical—head thrown back, hand slapping the table. “Oh gods—yes—yes—adopted already!”

She surged forward and pulled Kate into a fierce, quick hug. Kate hugged back, laughing into her shoulder.

Clara shook her head, still chuckling. “You’re both impossible.”

Kate finally picked up the stylus. She signed—clean, decisive strokes—then pushed the folder back across the table. Looking at Clara Kate points to her patch with a smile . 

The three women dissolved into easy laughter, the kind that filled the room like sunlight.

Clara leaned back, folding her hands. “Now. Sit properly. We want details.”

Kate exhaled, cheeks warming. “Last night… we talked. We had drinks. He told me the story—the one from when he was a boy, the friends, the Drazzan.” She paused, voice softening. “That was the moment I knew. He was the one.”

Cynthia tilted her head. “And after dinner?”

Kate’s smile turned private. “He stood up to leave. I honestly didn’t know what would happen next. My heart was in my throat. I was afraid he was going to walk out . Then he held out his hand and said, ‘I don’t wish to walk alone.’”

Clara’s eyes went soft.

“I took it,” Kate continued. “We walked the corridors. No plan, no rush. Next thing I knew we were back at his quarters. And then…” She trailed off with a small, helpless shrug.

Clara leaned in. “And then?”

Kate’s grin turned wicked. “A lady never tells.”

Cynthia cackled. “You’re no lady.”

You have no shame , saying you were to sore to spar , Clara laughed 

Kate lifted one shoulder. “We… practiced. Most of the night.”

Clara pressed a hand to her chest in mock drama. “Eight babies. Minimum.”

The room erupted again—laughter rolling over itself, bright and unrestrained.

Kate looking at Clara Pointing to the documents . They are Earth and Principality , Clara. Noble and not noble . 

Clara touching her finger to her lips . “ Kate you will need to add a part of earth to your house banner once married. 

Kate “ Clara Cynthia “ I’ll need help with the planning . 

Will you both help Laughing shaking their heads 

Outside the door, Declan stood at parade rest, staring fixedly at the opposite bulkhead, pretending he couldn’t hear a thing.

Inside, paperwork finished, futures tentatively named, and three women trading stories like they’d known each other for years.

1145 hours

And somewhere deeper in the ship, Wyatt—felt the quiet certainty settle a little more firmly in his chest.

Permanent, after all, was starting to feel like home.

1230 hours

Officers’ Mess – Private Alcove

The officers’ mess was quieter during the midday shift change—most of the crew either grabbing quick trays at the main line or eating at their stations. Clara had reserved the small private alcove at the far end , a curved booth with a holo-viewport showing the slow drift of stars and the faint blue curve of Haego below. Soft amber lighting, low background hum of the ship, and the smell of fresh coffee and grilled protein drifting in from the galley.

Kate arrived first, still in her crisp liaison uniform, hair still neatly back from the morning. Declan walked her as far as the mess entrance, gave a single nod, then peeled off toward the corridor without a word. She caught the faintest upward twitch of his mouth—almost a smile—before he disappeared.

Wyatt was already there.

He stood when he saw her, uniform jacket open over a plain undershirt, sleeves rolled to the forearms in that casual way he only allowed off-watch. Two trays waited on the table: simple, hearty lunch—grilled Haego rockfish fillets most likely , roasted root vegetables, a pile of hydroponic greens with sharp citrus dressing, and two tall glasses of chilled grape juice . A small carafe of black coffee sat between them, steam curling lazily.

He didn’t say anything at first—just watched her cross the alcove, eyes steady and warm.

Kate slid into the booth opposite him, then immediately reached across to brush her fingers over the back of his hand.

“Hi,” she said softly.

“Hi.” His voice was low, rough around the edges like he hadn’t quite shaken the morning yet. “You look… official.”

She laughed under her breath. “Clara’s paperwork. Permanent liaison. Full rank retained. I’m staying.”

Wyatt exhaled through his nose—a quiet, relieved sound. His thumb turned over to catch hers.

 A small smile tugged at his mouth. Pointing at the patch . 

Kate was in my quarters . I like it 

And Wyatt Clara said we should somehow add earth to the house banner once married . She says it would make a powerful statement 

Kate rolled her eyes fondly. “She’s already claiming naming rights on our hypothetical First  daughter.”

Wyatt’s brows lifted. “First ?”

“Apparently we’re committed to a full squad now.” She squeezed his hand. “Clara gets first . Cynthia second . I think they’re already fighting over middle names.”

He chuckled—low, real—and finally sat back, though he didn’t let go of her hand.

Wyatt middle names after my side of the family . 

And  you get to name the boys middle names “ 

They ate slowly. No rush. The rockfish flaked apart under the fork, still fragrant with last night’s herb butter. The pale ale cut through the richness with that clean citrus bite. Conversation drifted easy—ship gossip (Raquel had apparently bet Leo he couldn’t go a full shift without mentioning the “new permanent addition”), how the hydroponics team was experimenting with Earth strawberries, whether Declan would ever admit who kept making him go quiet whenever certain names came up.

At one point Wyatt leaned back, studying her over the rim of his glass.

“You added conditions to the liaison papers,” he said. Not a question.

Kate met his gaze. “I asked that when you visit Newtown, Leo, Reyes, and Declan come with you. Your friends. I want them there.”

Wyatt went still for a second. Then something soft and unguarded moved across his face.

“You didn’t have to do that.”

“I wanted to.” She shrugged one shoulder. “They’re your people. And now they’re mine too.”

He set the glass down carefully. Reached across the table again—this time both hands, lacing fingers with hers.

“Thank you,” he said quietly.

She smiled, small and sure. “You’re welcome.”

A comfortable silence settled. Looking at the halo-viewport, Haego turned slowly, clouds drifting across its oceans like spilled cream.

Wyatt finally spoke again, voice even lower.

“About Newtown. When we go down… there’s a place. Small house on the ridge above the brewery. Nothing fancy—wood frame, big porch, looks out over the valley. over the beach to the ocean , Been empty to long .” He paused. “Thought maybe… you’d like to see it. Stay there. With me.” 

There are Walnut trees a place for girls to ride horses , Heelers that shed everyday and boys riding motorcycle’s 

Kate : Wait why not let the girls ride motorcycle’s “ Wyatt starts laughing nodding ok

Then Kate’s breath caught—just for a second.

“I’d like that,” she said. “A lot.”

He nodded once, like a promise sealed.

Then, lighter: “ I’ve been reading on these Heelers “ they claim people . 

She laughed. “I’m ready to be claimed.”

They finished the meal in easy quiet—forks clinking softly, occasional glances, the simple comfort of being in the same space with no emergency, no deadline, no separation looming.

When the trays were nearly cleared, Wyatt reached for the coffee carafe, poured them each a fresh cup, and slid hers over.

“So,” he said, leaning forward slightly, elbows on the table. “Permanent. On paper. And off it.”

Kate wrapped her hands around the warm mug. “Off it feels even better.”

He studied her for a long moment—open, unguarded.

“Stay tonight,” he said. Not asking. Stating. . In my quarters. No walk this time. Just… us.”

Kate’s smile bloomed slow and bright.

“Already planning on it.” But in my quarters  as it may get loud”  

He exhaled a quiet laugh, then lifted his glass in a small, private toast.

“To permanent.”

She tapped hers against it.

“To permanent.”

They drank.

And for the first time in a long while, the future didn’t feel like something to brace against.

It felt like something to walk into—together

Just as they were about to leave . A young woman approached asking if they needed anything else. 

Kate started to say no , when she realized Declan may not have eaten . 

Seeing her name : Tammy , sir Declan Oakmoon  may not have eaten lunch . Would it be possible to have a meal sent to his quarters . Tammy’s face turns red saying yes. And I know what he likes . 

Kate noticing her smile 

Thank you 

1345 hours

The trays were cleared by a passing steward. Wyatt stood first, offered his hand.

Kate took it.

They left the alcove side by side—shoulders brushing, no hurry.

Somewhere down the corridor, Declan was waiting to resume escort. He fell in step behind them without comment.

And if he noticed the way their fingers stayed linked the whole walk back, he was wise enough not to say a word

Suddenly Kate turns towards Declan . Declan you should meet Tammy

I am 31M and my girlfriend is 26F.

We have been in a relationship for about 2 years. I’ve never had an issue inviting my girlfriend to dinners, buying drinks, or making plans where I cover the costs. 

When I stay over at her place (usually on weekends, sometimes once on the week), I pay for all the food we consume—either takeout or eating out. I honestly don’t remember the last time I woke up at her house and cooked breakfast, lunch, or dinner there. I do drink her coffee, and when it runs out, I buy her a new one. That’s about it in terms of what I consume at her place. I don’t keep clothes there, don’t use her washing machine, and the most I really use is the shower. I’ve tried to keep boundaries around how often I stay over, but if I don’t stay “enough,” she starts telling me I don’t love her or that I’m not committed to her.

In December, she went on a 10-day trip to Miami with friends and ended up staying 2 extra days, paying for the plane ticket change herself. She had just gotten a new credit card with a $6,000 limit and used it to cover the trip. I mentioned that if she was struggling financially, spending money on a party trip seemed odd to me. Her response was simply: *“I deserve it.”* The trip mostly consisted of going out partying and eating out, which I know isn’t cheap, especially in Miami.

While she was on this trip, she asked me to pay all of her electricity and internet bill for the previous month. I initially said I could help if she was tight on money, but she insisted that this was *expected* at this point in our relationship. 

I explained that I’ve been saving to move in together in about 6 months so that it would be financially comfortable for both of us. She told me that not moving in sooner made her feel unloved and like I wasn’t ready for her. That really hurt, because I’ve been working hard to get my finances in order specifically so we *can* live together. 

We ended up having a big argument where she said she doesn’t want to have to ask me to pitch in for her bills—she wants me to have the initiative to do it myself, even though we do not live together. I told her that her behavior seemed to come from a place of entitlement, not from actual need.

AITAH for not wanting to pay her bills under these circumstances?

Sorry this one is a long one

I work in politics, in the dark smokey room side, and for the past 6 months my GF haven't seen much of each other because of a recent promotion that's been the opportunity of a lifetime. Let's call her Hailey. Hailey and I have been together since University and to be blunt, she was the love of my life.

Sweet, dedicated, fiercely loyal and my best friend. Together we've done some pretty amazing things and when I look back on my life highlights our travels and years together will definitely be on there. Hailey & I have been finding the time away from each other tough (I work from about 6:30am-11pm, tend to be on the phone at weekends). 

However she's been really supportive and has continued to tell me to focus on the job for now (we both planned to move to NYC together once I'd completed this job). I know now that it's been a lot harder for Hailey than she let on, and for me I've just desperately missed my partner.

However long ago now I came down into the bathroom to say good morning to Hailey, and noticed a big love bite on her neck, which she'd been hiding under big jumpers. I confronted her about this as I hadn't been able to touch her in weeks after contracting scabies in Africa I knew it wasn't me. 

This all happened so fast I barely remember anything that was said, I just remember the feeling that my stomach was suddenly lined with lead. She told me it was an allergic reaction of all things, but after pressing it became clear she was hiding something, and then it quickly became clear that we both knew what had happened. 

Turns out she'd cheated with a mutual friend she secretly met up with, says she went to him for advice about our relationship and ended up seeking affection from him. She told me, obviously begged for another chance, asked me to marry her, and then eventually left in a taxi to her friend's house with her bags that I packed for her. (the house is all mine, we're not married. nothing legal to worry about here). 

After she left I calmly got everything ready for work, made my packed lunch, ironed my shirt and then just lost it and sat down with some whisky and some smokes and wallowed in self pity for the night. This has been my nightly routine for the last week. I've had a history of depression so whilst this has hit me unbelievably hard, the numbness and feelings of emptiness ultimately makes it easier to get things done. 

I'm not a crying wreck, I'm just kinda...done. Over the next few days I kept silent, didn't respond to any of the 90 missed calls. Eventually I rung her and told her we're over, I forgive her and dropped all of her things to my friend's house while Hailey was out at work.

Thing is, I don't hate her for this, I understand how she was feeling, and I know my job got in the way of what was a very close and spontaneous relationship. We became different people. I can forgive her but we have to be over, I'll never trust her again and I can't have her in my life anymore. Especially not when it's not even a good idea for me to have a partner while my life's like this. Whilst I forgive her, it doesn't mean I can ever love her like I did.

The next few days kind of led to a few impulse decisions. I went straight to my boss who is also one of my best friends, who, bless him, offered to give up all his annual leave so I could sort myself out. When I told him being in that house would just bring back bad memories he made me an offer - a year long position working on an enormous project for an international government - and I took it. 

This involves a completely new role, a new life in a new country, and a completely different kind of office and project. So I put my house up for rent (which my brother will look after for me) and decided to just buy a ticket and head to my new home early before the position starts (it also makes VISA stuff easier)

I've not told Hailey because I've tried to maintain NC and she has all her things.

The taxi is coming in about 2 hours:

Here are my questions:

1. Should I tell Hailey? Is it classless to let her find out from a friend?

2. How do I get closure, what process can I use when I'm so removed from everything

3. How do I stop this being a quick fix? Is there a risk I get home after a year and it all just instantly comes back? I'm really fearful that all I'm doing is running away from my problem and I'm worried moving away will mean I never engage with the fundamental betrayal

4. Any redditors have tips for moving to a new country? How do you meet people?

5. Have I been too rash?

6. IMPORTANTLY - anyone got any tips on getting over cheating? This is the second time I've been cheated on now and whilst I'm quite happy to have a year of just being single I'm worried about what happens after that? Is there even a point to trying to stay faithful to anyone?

Thanks in advance, and thanks for all the support over the years which has helped me managed the last week of my life

TL;DR Got cheated on, left the country, bit worried I've been a bit rash

>The only way I will deviate from the advice everyone has given you is with regards to #3. I'm a lot like you, in that there'd definitely be a risk that I'd come home after a year still hurting and wondering what happened. With that in mind, while I 100% do not think you should actually speak or meet up, I think that once you are out of the country (so there's no chance of you caving and seeing her), it wouldn't be inappropriate for you to ask her to write you a letter about it. I think that hearing her thoughts on it, as wrong as they may be, might actually help you get more closure than leaving it alone forever and wondering for months or years why she betrayed you. This will likely be an unpopular opinion, but I know it's what I would need in your situation.

# Update - after 6 days

^(December 29, 2014)

[**[UPDATE] Me [25 M/F] found out five nights ago that my girlfriend [25F] of 6 years cheated on me with a mutual friend [25M]- am now waiting for my taxi to take me to the airport for my new life, how do I deal with the closure?Infidelity**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2qpcqj/update_me_25_mf_found_out_five_nights_ago_that_my/)

Firstly thank you so much for all your support and kind words, it's made it a lot easier to keep doing the right thing and I've taken on board so many of your comments. Really meant a lot and I felt it more than I've felt much in the past week or so.

So some of you may remember that I had some questions, and that I was on my way to flying out to start a new life (which I never mentioned is in Africa). Stuff took some pretty funny turns since then and I thought I'd update you.

So I am still not in Africa, I missed my flight after my cab was involved in a very very minor collision. No one was hurt but you can't get another cab quickly on the motorway! Luckily I've got total insurance up to my eyeballs. 

I phoned my boss to tell him and was about to book flights for the weekend when my boss asked me to stay a few more days as he'd had an absolute tidal wave hit his desk. I'd do anything for this guy so I obviously agreed, and ended up deciding to stick around for Christmas to say goodbye to my family and give them a bit of time before I left for a year. 

My boss's Secretary spent most of the week finding me a new flat, booking me immunizations and generally sorting out my life to say thank you which was really nice.

So - I haven't told her I'm leaving, and no contact has been maintained. A good friend said she managed to have a conversation with Hailey and made clear that I'm serious about needing significant period of time of silence between us. Hailey is apparently handling it really badly - sobbing, having to have her friends look after her phone, ect. 

Which I thought would make me happy but it really doesn't. There is one person I told, her Father. Now anyone else on here I would strongly advise against breaking NC for ex's family members but you have to understand that I cannot not answer the phone to this man. 

I have so much respect for him and we've spent a huge amount of time alone drinking his amazing whisky collection and talking about things. He's given me a lot of vital support and counsel in my life and I'd be much worse off without him. He wanted to know if I could ever forgive his daughter, I explained that there's no point continuing now the trust is fundamentally destroyed and he apologised and accepted that. 

He actually told me I should think about getting myself away for some alone time and begged me to meet up with him in the city I work in. At this point I told him where I'm going and asked him not to tell Hailey until I'm gone. He promised he would honour my wishes and that was enough for me, this man is oldschool and I know his word means a lot to him. I also left some messages to pass on to family members clandestinely once I'm gone because the whole family have been amazing to me.

My time since has been much smoother than it could have been. I've hit the gym a lot (rule 1) and have spent at least 2 hours every night (except xmas) sparring with my brother. I've caught up with old friends before I leave and spent a lot of time with my family. 

We managed to complete the business that landed on my bosses desk and he took me for an incredible goodbye meal with himself and his wife which was nice - it was some unlimited meat joint which makes me wonder why all things aren't unlimited meat. 

My own mood has been promising. For a few days there was a concerning intensity of numbness but keeping myself busy really helped me feel normal again. Can't stress enough to everyone out there how important it is to get up and do stuff rather than wallowing, changes your whole mindset and makes everything so much easier.

In terms of other plans; I've already signed up to a muay thai gym out there and managed to find an old training partner who's working in the same city so have organised a meet. My plan is to just treat this a bit like a year out at university, work hard yeah but I'm going to get as much out of the experience as I can. I plan to blow all the money I was saving for H's birthday holiday.

Thank you to everyone who assured me that there are some people you can trust out there, but I think at least for a while I'm going to have to be single. I'm thinking of going to get some help because I know that functionally I'll be single for at least +1 year and I don't want distrust to become my default setting. Went to see my old psych about my depression flaring up who thought I was doing really well considering the circumstances so...yay.

I'm looking forward to my new life so much and I feel much better about my ability to use it as a new start rather than just running away and hiding my feelings. I might write Hailey a letter one day to get some answers to some questions but I'm still undecided and probably wouldn't go ahead with it until I'm sure I'm on the way to recovery.

To everyone out there, follow the advice on here, keep yourself busy and stick with NC, the whole next year is about me and I'm excited about what I can produce.

Thank you everyone, and good luck!

tl;dr: Not on the flight yet but in a much better place!

Maintaining contact with an ex's family is almost never a good idea, no matter how much you love them. I presume the most difficult part at this point will be going no contact with her family. When your SO's family loves you and you love them, breaking up hurts so much worse because you've also lost his/her family. But it's important that you try to cease and limit contact in order to fully move on, and so your future gf doesn't have to deal with all those untied strings.

# Final Update - after 4.5 months

^(May 12, 2015)

---

[**[UPDATE 4 MONTHS ON] Me [25 M/F] found out five nights ago that my girlfriend [25F] of 6 years cheated on me with a mutual friend [25M]- am now waiting for my taxi to take me to the airport for my new life, how do I deal with the closure? Infidelity**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/35p4ym/update_4_months_on_me_25_mf_found_out_five_nights/)

I'm back in the UK for a few weeks visiting some old friends and family (and my old boss!) and I thought I'd write an update. As some of you might have read 4 months ago I broke up with my ex after she cheated on me. This spurred me to accept a job offer in Africa, and the rest is history.

Firstly, Africa is the most incredible continent in the world. I'm based in the Tanzania but I've been fortunate enough to do a lot of travelling. The new job is incredible, getting some crazy experience, got my own driver and secretary, making some really big differences here and I think accepting this job was the best decision of my life. I'll be sad to leave at the end of the year.

In terms of how I'm dealing with the break up, this has been the perfect perfect way to deal with it. It's hard to wallow for too long when you're riding around dirt roads and are sat with new friends sharing beer and looking at the most stunning natural beauty you'll find. 

One of the perks of the job is that we work closely with NGOs who send out lots of aid workers/volunteers around my age who are all still looking to have a good time. I'm still single and it's been great to recapture my youth and go out and be free and make some new life experiences. 

On another thread someone said that at the start of every good story/adventure requires something like what happened to me to occur, to expose myself and make myself a bit braver than I would have been. I loved that, Hailey has really just been the first half a paragraph in a story that's been so enjoyable and invigorating.

Here's the 'break up porn' that I had to update you all on. This is proof that no matter how bad it is now, things can change, and once you heal the dynamics of power can fundamentally shift in an instant. I've maintained NC with Hailey. I've been updated by some friends that after she found out I left she asked all my friends if they know my African number (she's blocked from all email/social media/my phone) and has been living with her parents for months now having decided to spend some time on her own. 

Bear in mind I've not seen her since this all kicked off, or spoken to her. When I landed in London a few days ago guess who is waiting for me in arrivals (apart from my Mum of course). Hailey. Hailey comes from nowhere and kind of looks at me and starts crying. I was kind of speechless to be honest. Hailey had seen the flight details I'd posted on the wall of a mutual friend and taken a 4 hour train down to London to ask me to take her back. (Bear in mind this entire time my Mum is hovering in the background)

I told Hailey nothing had changed, thanked her for coming (I was genuinely touched by whatever this display was) and gave her some money to get a cab home (partly because she was a wreck, partly to make myself feel superior). At this point it really struck me how much everything had changed, I definitely still have some feelings for Hailey but they're couched much more reflectively, I felt extreme pity for her at that moment, and I don't think I've ever felt so sure that being on my own is what's best for me.

Thanks for all the support r/relationships, some of the advice I received on here has made a huge difference to how I've spent the last 4 months. For those of you just starting your journey, it gets better. Maintain no contact, look after yourself, go to the gym and make time to meet new people. I recommend taking yourself out on your own, it helps you figure out who you are and what you lost.

THANKS ALL

tl;dr: It gets a hell of a lot better!

EDIT: Overwhelmed with the response (and gold, although i'm not sure what the gold does), everyone who is reading this who is a bit further behind in their journey, don't worry, you got this. Not everyone has the chance to leave the country but you all have the chance to make more time for yourself.

>>It reminds you that as much as cheaters are painted as these complete assholes who aren't worth your time it's more complex than that. Good people cheat, people who'd make great wives/girlfriends cheat. It's just that once that happens you have to accept a relationship is unworkable 99% of time. When I was in Africa I spent some time kind of hating H, wishing her ill and I loved it when my friends said she didn't seem to handling the break up well. But seeing her at the airport was raw, and reminded me that I really want her to be happy, I just can't help her with that anymore.

>>Eeeerm I still got sad when I was in my flat on my own. Still thought about everything, I think the big thing is that I put myself in a situation where I was alone very rarely and was constantly having new experiences, it just made it less likely that I'd sit in with a bottle of wine and feel sorry for myself.

1qxlkmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualization/comments/1qxlkmh/best_virtual_office_options_in_los_angeles_for/,Best virtual office options in Los Angeles for small businesses in 2026?,"Hey everyone,



I'm running a small marketing agency and finally need to get a proper virtual office set up in LA. I've been working out of coffee shops and my apartment for the past year, but now I'm at the point where clients are asking for a business address and I'm tired of using my residential address for everything.



The LA market seems pretty saturated with options and I'm honestly getting analysis paralysis trying to choose. I've looked at the usual suspects - Regus has tons of locations but seems expensive, especially in areas like Beverly Hills or Santa Monica. There's also Davinci, Opus Virtual Offices (they seem to have multiple LA locations with straightforward pricing), and a bunch of smaller local providers I've never heard of.



My needs are pretty basic: a legit business address that I can use for my LLC registration and business cards, mail forwarding that actually works reliably, and ideally some kind of phone answering service since I miss calls constantly. I don't need a fancy address in the most expensive zip code, but I also don't want something that looks like a mailbox store when clients look it up.



Budget-wise I'm trying to stay around $100-150/month if that's realistic. I know some places advertise lower prices but then hit you with fees for everything - mail scans, package handling, extra call minutes, etc. I'd rather pay a bit more upfront for an all-inclusive package than deal with surprise charges every month.



Has anyone here used a virtual office in LA recently and been happy with it? Which areas/neighborhoods are best for business addresses? Any providers I should definitely avoid? Would really appreciate hearing from people with actual experience rather than just reading marketing copy on company websites.

We've been driving for days to a small town in Maine. Never even heard of this place. But Dad says it'll be a great fresh start, plus the money is better. 

I miss my old room already, I miss the Georgia peach air, I miss the warmth. This place already feels cold and dead. Driving up, there were golden and red tree lines. The branches on these trees seem lifeless. The trees have no leaves here, as if it's perpetual winter.  

The roads seem vacant of any atmosphere. Why would anyone live in such a static place? 

My daydreaming had overtaken me until I heard Ethan gasp next to me as we pulled into, quite honestly, the most suburban house I've ever seen. The monochromatic color scheme yanked it away from the wooded landscape, the bright white concrete reflected back at you so bright it stung. Nothing out of place, picture perfect. It felt like an adult dollhouse, frozen in time. 

Ethan raced out of the car the minute we stopped, excited to see his new room. My dad must have caught my worried gaze as he threw his arm over me comfortably. 

“Hey, love, this house is WAY bigger than the old one ain't it? You have your own room, your own space, a way nicer neighborhood too, just look at this place! He excitedly threw his hand out at the perfectly curved road ahead. Barren of all pets, people, or noise. Just the rows of houses that all looked the same as ours. 

I couldn't help but grin to make him feel better; he wanted to help. But there was something about this place. The silence, the frigid, unforgiving plain houses. Everyone's blinds were shut, no one was walking their dogs, and no kids were playing outside. Besides the over-pampered designer cars in some of the driveways, I would never think anyone lived here at all. 

A sad thought rushed over me as I remembered how fast we left. And how many people I never said goodbye to. 

The frigid breeze slammed into me, as I glanced around and realized the rest of my family was inside. 

As I turn to go in I notice the house next to us, someone has parted the blinds, they’re watching me. As quickly as I had noticed, they pulled back. The hair on my arms stood on end, I brushed it off to the closing winter air, and trotted indoors to my family. 

They were all gathered in the glamorous marble kitchen. My dad had a shining smile from ear to ear. Excitedly telling my mother, who looked as glazed over as ever, what his future plans for the dining room would be. 

He caught my eye. “Teryn! Go check out your new room!”

“Uhhhh, yeh ok”.. 

I responded as I begrudgingly pulled myself up the dark wood stairs. 

The stairs overlooked a huge 2-story living room, with a marble fireplace, and looming windows that swallowed up the space. The dark floors contrasted with the stark white walls. Despite all the lights being on, it felt so dark and gloomy. 

I saw Ethan's things in the first bedroom, so I opened the next one directly ahead. It was…just a room. I took a large, shaky breath in trying to relax and swallow my sadness. The bright street light in front of our house showed the street illuminating all the houses around us as far as the glowing bulb could show. All of them…were dark. Was I right?? Did no one really live here?? I pursed my lips, holding back my thoughts that I had to just run out of this house and never come back. Every nerve in my body felt tense. I had never felt this before, such unease. A constant feeling that I was going to be sick. 

To make matters worse, something caught my eye outside. A woman. Walking out of the house next door to us, maybe she was the one watching me before. She seemed to walk with a limp, as if in pain. She looked no older than my mom but walked like my grandma. As if every step was weakening her frail form. She hobbled past the view from the streetlight. I strained my eyes trying to see her direction after. 

I felt a hand on my shoulder, and I almost shrieked. My dad's worried eyes met mine. 

“What's wrong? I didn't mean to scare you!” 

I thought about telling him what I just saw, but I just shrugged as I knew the woman was long gone from view. 

“I wanted to tell you, Teryn, your room is downstairs. You can have the master bedroom. You’ll even have your own bathroom all to yourself.”

He could see that I started to question the process-

“Your mom…she wants to keep Ethan…close..”

I nodded, “ok dad…yeah, that's fine. Thanks, I guess.” 

I trudged down the stairs. Passing the empty living room. My brother played with his cars on the dusty floor while my mom held his shoulder from behind. She glanced up at me as I walked by. I smiled warmly at her. She averted her eyes and continued, absent-mindedly watching my brother play. 

The master was larger and had a gaping bay window with a view of the woods behind. In the pitch dark of this evening, and with all the things I had already seen, I quickly threw the dusty blinds closed. 

We had brought our camping gear to stay the first night, as the moving truck would arrive tomorrow. 

I thought back before Ethan was born that my dad and I would go camping for the weekend. He would make the stupidest jokes I’d ever heard and would struggle to light a fire as we got eaten by mosquitoes. But it was some of the best times I remember in my life. I smiled as I drifted off that night. 

I was awoken, I'm assuming a few hours later, by heavy footsteps above me. My parents' bedroom. By the tone, it sounded like my parents were arguing, which was nothing new. But after about a minute, I realized I had only heard my dad's voice. My mother hadn't said a word. I brushed it off that he was upset, and she was giving him the silent treatment or something.  And covered my ear tightly with my hand as I rolled over to get back to sleep. 

In the morning, Ethan eagerly knocked on my door. “Movers are here!”

He was just excited to get his Xbox unloaded as soon as possible. I took my time getting out there. 

As I got out to the truck, my dad was heaving, attempting to lift our furniture out all on his own. I was able to catch the coffee table before it smashed to the ground. 

“God, Dad, where's the movers? Can they help you??” 

“Yeah, not sure love, the truck was just open when I came out. No one inside. Must be on lunch or something-”

“Good Morning!!” 

A bellowing voice nearly caused my dad and me to jump out of our skin. The woman who I recognized as the lady outside last night. Mainly, she was wearing the same clothes. But had seemed to lose her limp. 

“Oh, why, you must be Lawerance! And Teryn, I presume! Peggy, the real estate agent, is a dear friend of mine and told me all about the new family we were going to have moving in. We are just so excited to have you!” 

My dad and I made eye contact, and he chuckled nervously before turning to her. 

“Ahh yeah…..that's great. I'm sorry, what did you say your name was?” 

“Oh yes, I'm Rita. I live just next door. She turned to point at her identical home behind her. 

“Peggy mentioned you just had the most gorgeous baby boy as well! Where is he? With his mother, I imagine?” 

My dad's face immediately ditched the fake smile and fell into contention. “Umm, well, actually my wife and I lost our son Henry to SIDS 3 weeks ago….I’m sorry, but if Peggy really told you all of this about my family-” 

Rita cut in -“Oh well that's just terrible news! I’m so very sorry, I will be praying for your family. I really should be going now!” As she turned to leave, her smile had fallen. But not into sadness, more like disgust or…disappointment.” 

She scuttled off, leaving my dad and me dumbstruck, staring at each other. Neither of us knew what to say. I finally broke the silence. “Dang, these white neighborhoods are something, aren't they Dad?” He mustered a chuckle before his face turned stern once more. “Don't tell your mom about this, Teryn. She already has so much she's dealing with.” 

I nodded, and we finished unloading the moving truck on our own; the moving crew never returned that I saw. Must have been some lunch they were taking. 

My mom had food ready for us, and we finally sat down to rest. I cut into my pork chop as my father started questioning Ethan and me about our “excitement” for school tomorrow. I gave my typical nothing answers and left the chatting up to Ethan, as I usually did with our family gatherings. 

Until I bit into the pork chop. The texture was normal, but the flavor tasted like it was coated in sugar. I tried to politely keep eating it, until I had to spit it out. My dad was ready to scold me until I saw his eyes widen as well when he took a bite of his. 

“Uhhh, Babe?” “What did you put on this food?” 

My mom stood there like a deer in the headlights. Before looking through all the spices she had pulled out of the boxes. 

“Oh no! I must have mixed up the spices. I just can't read these labels! I think it's time I get glasses finally!!” 

She and my dad shared a light chuckle that died off quickly as they pensively shifted back to staring off in their own worlds. 

I ate what I could of the food, but ultimately excused myself early, certainly going to bed hungry that evening. 

Thinking back on this I can't believe that would really be our last real dinner as a family. 

That night the footsteps started again. They were heaving and sounded like someone with heavy boots on was pacing back and forth. It had to be my dad. But at this time of the night why was he up, pacing?. My mom would have to be in the room still, maybe sleeping. Though she was on so many sleeping pills, who even knew what she was capable of hearing? I listened for their voices again, to see if he and my mom were talking. 

I could hear a light voice. That sounded like my dad, like he was maybe talking or whispering to himself loudly over and over again. In line with his pacing. As if he were keeping time with his sentences. Right when I was about to roll over to try and get some sleep. I heard him. A voice that wasn't my dad's. 

“Lawrence, what are you going to do?” 

The man's voice said plain as day. I sat bolt-upright in bed. My chest immediately tightened. Who the hell was that??? I almost called out to my dad. But something in my throat closed up. I couldn't even speak if I wanted to. 

I chose to listen. The voice never came again. But the footsteps never stopped. The pacing continued through the whole night. A consistent cadence, nearly becoming background noise so I didn't notice when different steps made their way to my room. 

My mom swung open my door, eyes wide open, hysterical. 

“Henry, you hush now!” She wailed at me as she found her way on top of my chest, hands pressing down on my mouth with incredible force. 

I tried to scream, “Mom! Stop, it’s me!” Almost a dozen times, but her eyes were lifeless and glued to mine in a catatonic state. Like she was in a dream. I finally decided to relax under her pressure, play dead. Her head cocked to the side in investigation. A red tear welling up in her eye. “Teryn, is that you?” She cooed right before my dad charged into the room and yanked her off of me. 

She moaned in a fit of discomfort as my dad dragged her out of the room. Red streaks down her face.  

“Sorry, sweetie, your mom’s just sleepwalking again. I’ll have to see the doctor tomorrow first thing!” I sat, frozen in place from what was my new normal it now seemed. 

My eyes were so tired, I barely remember getting dressed for school the next day. I was finally expecting to see some life in the neighborhood, as school time encroached, I was sure we would see kids rushing out of their homes to make it to the bus stop I was told was at the end of the block. But there was no one. The streets remained silent, just the gentle cold breeze whispering through the woods around us. 

Ethan talked my ear off as per usual. I was too tired to pay attention, and before I knew it, we were coming to a stop at the end of our lane. I looked around for any other kids coming. No one. As the wind picked up and I braced for it, I noticed the surrounding areas were covered in a thick fog. I hadn't noticed any rain or humidity. Yet you couldn't even see the tops of the ancient trees. 

Ethan tugged on my sleeve. I turned to him, annoyed, but he wasn't looking at me. He was staring into the fogged woods opposite where I was looking. He leaned forward inquisitively. “Teryn, how do they know my name?” 

“What??” I shot back.

“I never met them before, Teryn. How do they know me?” 

Who the FUCK was they? I froze. 

“Ethan, who are you talking about? There's nothing there-” 

A loud whistle echoed from the fogged trees. Not a summoning whistle like someone calling their dog. A long, drawn-out call. Almost like a warning. I couldn’t breathe; my swallow caught in my throat. We had to get back home. If I could even call it that. 

The surrounding neighborhood had fallen silent, not even the gale of wind. No bugs, no distant highway sounds. Like we were in our own vacuum of the universe. I just fixed my eyes where Ethan had, looking for anything beyond the fog, any movement. 

The whistle sounded again. This time, deafening, as if it were a beam of sound directed toward us. I grabbed Ethan's hand out of instinct and went to run. In that instant, the bus pulled around the corner behind us and stopped in front of us, the whistle stopping just as fast as it started.  

My heart was racing. I looked at Ethan's worried, fixed stare and had to pose myself for him. I gently nodded at him to get on the bus. 

The trip to the small school was basically a blur. There were a few kids on the bus whose eyes were glued to us the moment we boarded. Ethan stuck to my side and went to turn to look at them, but I pulled him back. 

As we pulled up to the school I was relieved to see dozens of other kids of varying ages walking in. It felt so much less lonely. Two people waited outside our bus as it crawled to a stop, holding signs with our names on them. A chipper-looking blonde girl held mine, and our weird neighbor Rita held Ethan's…

She practically ignored me and was fixated on Ethan as we disembarked. 

“Why, you must be Ethan!!” She greeted him. “I'm Rita, and I’m the leader of fun here at school for all the kids your age!” 

Ethan seemed elated to see a friendly face. 

She finally met my gaze as well. 

“Oh well, hey there Teryn!! I hope your family is settling in just great!” 

“Oh, we're doing fine, thanks.” I tried to sound as confident as I could despite my throat screaming for tears. 

“Well, I’ll take good care of your brother here, and you and Rachel best be making your way to homeroom.”

Rita gestured to the giddy schoolgirl waiting patiently behind my shoulder. 

They walked off hand and hand as Rachel clearly started to introduce herself behind me, I couldn't in the slightest begin to listen. I felt like I had a ringing in my ears still from the whistle. What was that! Ethan heard it too. I can't be going crazy!

“HEY!” Rachel finally grabbed my wrist and jolted me back to reality. 

“Girl, you look like something my dad fished in! Did you even get any sleep last night?? New shit is always terrible, man, come with me, I'll show you a chill spot.” 

She still had hold of my wrist, and I was in no place to refuse, so I trudged aside her. 

“Ar..Aren't we supposed to be heading to a class?” 

“Ahh fuck that.” Rachel laughed, “They don't even know who you are, we can hang a minute! You're cool to hang right??” 

I uncomfortably laughed and nodded as we wandered into the woods nearest the school. 

Once past the treeline, she plopped down quickly and pulled out a cigarette for herself and handed me one. 

I had never smoked in my life; my grandad did and the whole house always wrecked it. My dad would kill me if he found out later. But Rachel was basically the picturesque version of a teen cover girl model. Was I just supposed to make her think I was a loser on my first day?? 

I swallowed my fears as I puffed on a cigarette silently next to her. Trying to watch how she did it to make it seem like I knew what I was doing. 

“So what brings ya here?” Rachel asked. 

“My dad got a job nearby, apparently,” I responded 

“I thought it was cause your brother died”. She shot back

First Rita, but now this girl. How the fuck does everyone in this town know about my family? 

“Well…That might have been a part of it. “How does everyone here know so much about us-”

“It’s my mom's job to know everyone that comes here, she says we only accept the best, so you should consider yourself lucky. Wish I could consider myself lucky, she works here at the school with the younger kids so I never catch a break. You saw her earlier, always making me greet the annoying new kids, no offense.” 

She takes a long drag of her cigarette. 

Her mom was Rita?? Our neighbor?? 

How come I hadn't seen her, or anyone besides Rita, for that matter?? 

My chest tightened before I could respond. I only managed a small grin to hide my confusion. Trying to piece together what was going on in this weird-ass place. 

This town was scaring the living hell out of me. I didn't know how to place it, but it wasn't right, and I knew it. 

“You know, I’m feeling a little lightheaded. I think I’m gonna get some air, ok?” I shookly said to Rachel. 

“Sure dude, I ain't got shit else to do, I'll be here.”

I stumbled off toward the school, my vision blurring from panic. It felt like my entire world was spinning around me, but my feet were glued to the ground, begging to come undone. 

As I neared the school, I saw a familiar car, my dad's car. 

My heart was pounding out of my chest to begin with, now a new panic set in as I thought over my dad smelling smoke on me. 

As my dad exited the car, his concerned and determined expression erased my fears. 

“Teryn, I came for you and your brother… your mother… she's not doing well.” 

“What…what does that mean Dad??” 

“Once we got to the doctors this morning, she couldn't see. The doctors don't know what's wrong at all. They had to induce her into a coma to stop the internal bleeding. I wish I knew more, baby, I really do, I just came to get you two.” 

“Is…is she going to get her sight back???” I stammered. 

“Don't tell your brother the situation, we need to support her right now while the doctors figure out what's wrong,” Dad said, evading my question. 

The car trip to the hospital was a tizzy; my hysterical dizziness had yet to leave. As my brother sat worried next to me. He went to grab my hand a couple of times, and I jerked away in discomfort. Disgusted at the time to be touched, but in retrospect, disgusted at myself to be so closed off to my baby brother. 

That night, as I sat awake watching my mother's breathing apparatus slide up and down. Bandages lay over her eyes, covering what seemed to be wounds where her eyes were. She really just woke up like that?? 

 I glanced over at my father and brothers, slumped over sleeping bodies. Thinking over the arguing I had been hearing, the footsteps, the mysterious voice. Has someone…done this to her?? 

I immediately shake my negative, sinister thoughts and focus back on my mom. 

Figuring since I couldn't sleep, this would be a great time to start to repeat the prayer my mother had always taught me when I was a kid. 

The moment the first words left my mouth. The footsteps started. 

I stayed frozen, silent, for what felt like an hour. My knees were screaming from the pain of being locked in place. I could hear my heartbeat thud in my ear as I listened for them to start again. They never did. 

I slowly slid my hands out from my mother's and trudged back toward the sterile hospital seating. The moment I took a step. There it was again. 

*ThudThud. ThudThud. ThudThud.* 

Right above me, in quick cadence as if pacing back and forth, back and forth. 

I turned to look at my mother as the sounds continued, my mouth fell dry as my eyes fell on her heart monitor. The steps above me were in line with her heartbeat. 

What was happening?? My breath was too choked to even speak as I tried to whisper to my dad to wake him. 

“D.. Ddd…Dad”

The thumping became louder above me. More pronounced. 

“Dad!” 

My breath cracked, and I tried to squeak out anything in my final attempt to get anyone else to see this. 

The stepping became stomps as the thudding became slams, as if the hits were breaking through the foundation and floors to collapse on top of us. I swore I even heard the beams cracking above me. 

I threw my hands over my ears in the rush of sounds. Tears were welling up and spilling down my face. 

“JUST STOP THIS,” I shrieked out. Now down on my hands and knees on the floor. Unable to even open my eyes through the sting of tears. 

The room fell silent. Nothing left but a ringing in my ears. That was how my mother died. She was the first. 

\*\*\*

My dad tried to handle everything. The glazed-over expression my mother used to wear had been passed on to him. 

He retreated mostly to the garage and his room, insistent on us not going in and disturbing him. It was normal not to see him for days on end.  

Ethan stuck to my side every moment. He wouldn't let me go anywhere alone, even to the toilet. 

I wouldn't let him come in with me, but I would see his eager and anxious steps outside the door every time. 

My dad still made us go to school. I thought it was cruel at the time to force me to go to Algebra when my mom had just died. But looking back, I understand why he wanted us out of the house as much as possible, and why he insisted on being alone. 

I looked for Rachel in the hallways, as she was the only familiar face I knew. But she and her mother Rita seemed to be absent. 

I couldn't help but think every face that passed me in the halls watched me. Their glares burn into the back of my neck like a hot poker. But I pushed it down, I minimized the constant gut-wrenching feeling of being alone and nervous. And went to my classes as my dad had told me, day in and day out. 

I even had the urge to knock on Rita and Rachel's door one day. Ethan trailed behind me, hiding from sight as I rang the doorbell. I took in their front porch as I waited. I noticed how empty it was, despite a large smudge of substance that seemed haphazardly thrown over the threshold of the doorway. 

After no one came to the door for a while, my nosiness got the best of me. I peered in the thin, tall window next to the door. Not only did it look like no one was home. It looked like no one lived there. There were dirt and leaves strewn across the floor. The walls were bare, and the furniture I could see was covered with dirty sheets. 

My eyes were strained inside. I didn't even notice Ethan calling my name behind me. 

“Teryn….TERYN!” 

I swung around, annoyed with him, turning my back to the door. 

“What, Ethan? There's no one home-” 

The deck shook underneath us as something slammed full force into the metal front door. Ethan's eyes widened to the size of saucers and I was too scared to turn around. I grabbed Ethan's hand and we sprinted back to the house. I tried to keep Ethan in pace with me, but his eyes were glued to the house. 

Once in our house, I locked every door I could find. Ethan sat comfortably on the couch the entire time. I expected him to be terrified, but he seemed so at ease. 

When I asked him if he was alright, he just giggled and nodded up at me. 

The pit in my stomach that had started when we moved here felt like a mass, growing every moment I spent here.

After Mom, Ethan always wanted to sleep with me, but I always made him sleep on the floor, which he happily accepted just to be close. But tonight, when I motioned for him to come to my room for bed. He shook his head and happily waltzed to his room. 

What I had thought initially was a nuisance of Ethan sleeping in my room, I hadn't realized how much less alone it made me feel. Starting that night, the nightmares started. At least I'm going to tell myself they were nightmares because I will not allow myself to accept all of this as fact.  

I heard a door slam upstairs a few hours later. I heard the small padding steps of Ethan's feet running down the stairs. I groaned against the covers as I pulled myself out of bed.  

His shadow sat on the other side of my locked door. But before I could move to open it, he started to laugh. Like really laugh, as if it was the funniest thing someone could have said to him. Or like how my mom would tickle him when he was a baby. 

“Mom, stop!” I heard Ethan laugh. A cold rush plunged over me, and I gritted my teeth and ripped open my door with the last remaining bravery I had. 

“Ethan!” I yelled into an empty, dark house. 

The house was pitch black and silent. Not even a creaking of the pipes, I could only hear my shallow breathing. I shook my head in disbelief as I closed and locked my door behind me. 

What was happening? I ran my hands over my face, trying to soothe the small aching headache that had begun to form behind my eyes. 

Somehow, I fell back asleep, telling myself it must have been a night terror. 

When I awoke again, I couldn’t move. My back was turned to my door, and my eyes could just see over the lip of the window to the barren lawn outside. 

I heard it, scratching at my door. Not like a digging repetitive scratch, this was purposeful movements, like Edward Scissorhands trying to shake hands for the first time. Whatever the scratcher was, it was trying to open my door. 

I mumbled to myself, trying anything I could to bring myself out of paralysis, my breathing stuck in a perpetual REM state. I wanted to scream when I heard the door latch finally click open. 

The dark hallway still did not hide the looming, bent-over figure in the doorway. Its spine lurched forward so I couldn't even see the frame of its head, if it even had one. Its frame was so thin I could barely make out where its body began. It stepped into my room, and I felt warm tears slide down my frozen face. 

As it grew closer, I could hear its joints moving with every motion. A clicking and cracking that nauseated me. As if nothing but skin held it together. 

My breath grew short and tight as I felt its weight on the other side of my back on the bed. I was so desperate to wake up, but now I’m not sure I want to again. 

It moved to lie down beside me, putting a limb over me to hold me from behind gently. My tears turned into small sobs as I caught the reflection of its hand in the glass of the window. 

Its hands were elongated and didn’t appear to have joints anymore. That is, if it ever did. Just long lumps of flesh with what looked like the remains of nail beds at the tip. I slammed my eyes shut. This wasn't real, this wasn't real. I was dreaming, and it would go away. As the minutes ticked on it didn’t move, and didn’t breathe. The thing was radiating heat. As it lay next to me unbreathing, that's all I could feel. Even through my thick winter blanket. It burned right through like a hot water bottle. Cooking whatever it was from the inside out. 

I suddenly felt a feeling in my right foot, and I knew I was waking up. I gathered what strength I had and tried to let out a scream. But all that managed was a pathetic whimper and moan. The thing leaped up and seemed to step out of my room in one motion. And just like that it was gone. 

Even in my waking state, I stayed motionless the rest of the night. Terrified if I moved it would come back, and I would truly have to face it head-on.

---

**Title:** Why Every Adult Needs a Coloring Book (Yes, Seriously) 🎨🧠

We’ve all been there: too many tabs open, coffee going cold, your brain playing mental ping-pong between *responsible adulting* and *existential dread*.  

And then, one day, someone hands you a coloring page.  
You roll your eyes (because, let’s be honest, you’re not five).  
But ten minutes later, you’re blending shades of teal and coral, your breathing slows, and the noise in your head — that constant, dull hum — finally quiets.  

That’s when it hits you. Coloring isn’t about being “childish.”  
It’s about finding small corners of calm in an overstimulated world.

---

Here’s what makes coloring genuinely powerful for adults:

• **Mindful escape:** Coloring activates the same parts of your brain used in meditation — without the awkward silence or wondering if you’re “doing it right.”  
• **Stress release:** Focusing on tiny details gives your mind something gentle to hold, shifting attention away from anxiety loops.  
• **Creative reboot:** When you color, you’re not consuming — you’re *creating.* And that simple act can spark motivation everywhere else in life.

I’ve designed a free **Adult Coloring Book PDF** filled with patterns, shapes, and designs meant to release tension and reconnect you with your creative side.  
If you’ve got ten minutes between Zoom calls or just need a mental timeout, this is your sign.  

👉 **Download your free PDF here:** [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)

---

What’s cool is hearing people say things like,  
> “Coloring became my nighttime ritual. It’s better than doomscrolling.”  
or  
> “It’s weirdly meditative — like therapy, but with markers instead of couches.”  

So, if you’ve been waiting for a low-effort, high‑reward way to slow down and recharge (no incantation or incense necessary), your coloring journey starts here:

👉 **Grab your free Adult Coloring Book PDF:** [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)

Do it for your inner artist. Do it for your overworked nervous system.  
Or simply do it because it’s fun — no justification required.

One more time for anyone who scrolled straight to the end (yeah, I see you 🤫):  
👉 [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)

---

If even one person finds ten peaceful minutes because of this, that’s a small victory worth more than any productivity hack.  
Be gentle with yourself. Pick up some colors tonight.

I’m a 26-year-old man, introverted, calm, and easy to talk to. People say I’m above average looking, but what matters more is that I’m a good listener and I enjoy real conversations.

I’m single and would love to go on a simple, nice date this Valentine’s Day. Coffee, a walk, or just talking and laughing.

1qxlbxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1qxlbxf/parking_tips_for_stockyards_showdown_finals_at/,parking tips for stockyards showdown finals at tannahill's tavern and music hall (fort worth 02/07),"  
  
hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking advice for the stockyards showdown finals on 02/07. the stockyards area gets absolutely crazy, especially for an event starting at 3:00 pm when the regular tourist traffic is still heavy and you've got the 4:00 pm cattle drive coming through. planning ahead is definitely the way to go to avoid a headache.  
  
honestly the best way to go is using an app like Prked. you can rent a private driveway or garage from a local right next to tannahill's tavern and music hall. it’s usually way cheaper than the official lots and you get to skip a lot of the traffic chaos getting in and out, plus it's a short, easy walk to the venue.  
  
if you’re set on official parking, tannahill’s itself has valet right on exchange street. it’s convenient but that line can really back up, especially at $20 a pop. otherwise, you're looking at the stockyards official parking lots which are scattered around mule alley and exchange avenue. they can be a bit of a walk depending on which one you land in. an event rate is usually applied, which means you’re looking at about $15 to $20 to park.  
  
super important: the official stockyards lots are credit card only, they do not accept cash, so don't get stuck trying to pay with paper money. lot 956-pearl's is one that is specifically right next to the venue and is a few minutes walk, so look for signs for that one if you're close.  
  
for a guarantee, you can also check pre-paid parking apps like spothero or seatgeek for specific lots like lot 995 or 2326 n main st to reserve a space ahead of time. this locks in your spot and avoids any day-of price hikes.  
  
i've seen people mention free street parking on east exchange avenue, but honestly don't count on it. those spots are snagged super early, and with a 3:00 pm start, your chances are almost zero.  
  
my advice is to just get there early, around 2:00 pm, grab a coffee or a quick bite, and be settled before the afternoon rush and the cattle drive start closing in. the whole stockyards area is a big draw, so be prepared for crowds and traffic delays, especially right before and after the event.  
  
hope this helps and enjoy the showdown!",1,1770393220.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

1qxlarr,https://www.reddit.com/r/solopassions/comments/1qxlarr/just_survived_my_first_solo_trip_to_europe_it/,"Just survived my first solo trip to Europe: It wasn't glamorous, but I learned how to travel on a shoestring 🎒","Alright, let's cut through the Instagram veneer for a second. My first solo trip to Europe? It was less ""golden hour strolls with a perfectly curated croissant"" and more ""sprinting for a train with a backpack that felt heavier than my life choices."" I just got back from three weeks navigating France, Italy, and Spain on a budget so tight it squeaked, and honestly, it taught me more about travel (and myself) than any glossy magazine ever could.

Here’s the breakdown of how I did it, and what it *really* felt like:

*   **The Route & Time:**
    *   **Paris, France:** 5 days
    *   **Rome, Italy:** 6 days
    *   **Barcelona, Spain:** 7 days
    *   Total trip: **18 days** (plus travel days). I flew into Paris and out of Barcelona.

*   **The Budget (and how I stuck to it-ish):**
    *   **Average daily spend: €45-€55** (excluding international flights, but covering accommodation, food, local transport, and a few attractions). This sometimes dipped lower, sometimes crept higher after a weakness for a nice glass of wine.
    *   **Accommodation:** Exclusively **hostel dorms**. I stayed at The People Hostel in Paris, The Yellow in Rome, and Generator in Barcelona. Costs ranged from €20-€35/night. Key lesson: Read reviews for bed bugs AND the social vibe.
    *   **Food:** This was my biggest saver.
        *   **Breakfast:** Usually free at the hostel, or coffee and a pastry from a local bakery (€3-€5).
        *   **Lunch:** Supermarket sandwiches/salads, street food like falafel or a Roman pizza slice (€5-€8). Picnic in a park was a regular thing.
        *   **Dinner:** Cooking in hostel kitchens (pasta, eggs, veggies – total game-changer for budget), or splitting a tapas plate/cheap local meal (€10-€15). I tried to limit eating out to once every 2-3 days for dinner.
    *   **Transportation:** **Walking was king.** Public transport passes for city exploration (€15-€25 for multi-day passes). I took an overnight bus from Paris to Rome (a grueling 18-hour journey that saved me a flight and a night of accommodation, but I wouldn't recommend it for the faint of heart). Then a budget flight from Rome to Barcelona.

**The Real Talk – It Wasn't Always Pretty:**

*   **Getting Lost (A Lot):** My phone died in a maze of Parisian streets trying to find my hostel on day one. No data, no map, just a rapidly dwindling sense of humor. Ended up asking a lovely older lady who walked me half a mile out of her way. That was humbling.
*   **The Laundry Crisis:** Trying to handwash clothes in a hostel sink and hoping they'd dry overnight is a special kind of stress. Pro tip: Just pay for the hostel laundry service, or pack more underwear.
*   **Moments of Solitude:** Yeah, solo travel can get lonely. There were evenings in crowded hostel common rooms where everyone else seemed to have found their new best friend, and I just sat there, journaling, feeling a bit adrift. But those moments also pushed me to step out of my comfort zone and strike up conversations.
*   **The Unexpected Wins:** Discovering a tiny, unpretentious pizza place in Rome that served the best slice of my life for €2. Finding a free classical music concert in a Barcelona park. The sheer joy of successfully navigating a foreign public transport system all by myself. These little victories felt huge.
*   **My backpack weight was a constant battle.** Seriously, pack light. Lighter than you think.

This trip wasn't glamorous. My hair was usually a mess, my shoes were perpetually dusty, and I definitely looked more confused tourist than seasoned explorer. But I learned how to stretch a Euro until it screamed, how to trust my gut, and how incredibly resilient you can be when you’re out of your element.

1qxlaid,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntelligenceScaling/comments/1qxlaid/kiruma_souichi_fn_fan_novel_part_1/,Kiruma Souichi FN (Fan Novel) Part 1,"So the community may or may not be familiar with a very niche, underrated and seldom discussed character in SCD media called 'Kiruma Souichi' or 'Hal' or 'Leader' or 'Hachina' or 'the goat'. I've begun to notice a dire lack of diversity in the characters used by the community, so I've decided to mildly adapt a few of Souichi's feats to keep up to date with the changing meta. I hope you enjoy!

First Bookstore Arc:

Hal enters the room and immediately memorises all the books, showcasing his god-like observation (sensory), before noticing a white haired boy near him. Just from a slight shrugging of his shoulders and his unimpressive visage, Hal concludes that Baku is in fact a person, and since Hal has no friends 😥, Hal strikes up a conversation about the weather (social skills). Just before this boy first opened his mouth however, he already guessed his name was Baku (intuition). Stunned, Baku asked who Hal was. Hal waffles about Alien and Baku decides to leave because this person is clearly mentally unwell. However, anticipating this, Hal had already locked all the doors (planning). Baku immediately notices this, and fearing for his life, begins to run away. Given his struggles with autism, Hal suffers from poor fine motor skills and balance, so when he begins to chase after Baku, he clumsily falls over. Baku had already assessed this trait of Hal as soon as he walked in, and cunningly used it to his advantage. Seeing his plan had succeeded, Baku laughs and eats his Kariume. Shockingly, Hal began to laugh, and Baku realized the truth: Hal had already spiked his Kariume with an extremely potent muscle relaxant (planning). Just then, it became clear what Hal's true motive was: to steal the Prince Bee book. Ripping the book from Baku's tense hands, Hal glanced over a few pages and instantaneously deduced the location of The Arizuka Building, where he had stored his secret weapon, but sadly forgot. But this forgetfulness was actually just a part of his plan too, as we'll see in the final arc.

Fukurou Gamble:

Since he feels no need to prove himself to Baku, Hal sneakily checks for the location on the bullet in the gun and just shoots Fukurou instead (strategy). Fukurou's guards began to shoot, but Hal had already calculated the exact angles at which the gun would fire (VSI) and allowed the bullets to reflect off the walls and hit the gunmen as Hal leaves with a flourish.

First STL:

Baku instead actually wants to win this time, so chooses poker instead. In a bold display of deceptive prowess, Leader pretends to lose his memories, clutching his head and yelling ""where are my memories going!?"". Baku, immediately noticing his chance swapped Leader's cards with worse ones while no one was looking. In that same instance, Leader calls out Baku's cheating, revealing his memory loss to be a ruse (deception). However, Baku had already prepared for this, as he had planned extremely foggy weather for the night of STL to allow him to swap the cards without detection from the referees by releasing massive amounts of carbon particulates into the atmosphere. However, Leader was prepared, revealing a mini camera that was installed on one of his nearby Rubik's cubes, and so it was that Baku Madarame was sentenced to death. But seeing further uses of the gambler, Leader decides to let Baku live (LT planning).

Abandoned Mine:

Leader pulls up, says his iconic line and naturally everyone starts laughing (SQ). Even Baku, Kaji and the dead bald person, finding this so utterly hilarious begin to also laugh uncontrollably. But then Leader stops and uses Echolocation (he learnt this already btw) and notices Baku is about to have a heart attack from exerting too much energy by laughing. Realising he has been manipulated (Manipulation), Baku gets angry at Leader, who stares at him coldly saying ""You'll never become The Leader of Kakerou. I don't even have memory loss and have never heard of a leap second in my life"". This was all a genius display of foresight and reverse psychology to make Baku pursue STL even more passionately, noting that Leader might have memory loss, and that he could potentially use a 'leap second' in a gamble against him if he was unaware of its existence. Leader pretends to accidentally slip and press the free Kakerou membership button to give Baku membership again, cursing under his breath that Baku could gamble again, much to his rival's delight. Leader then fires the missiles because stock market blah blah (Hal also controlled the stock market when he was 3 btw).

Tower of Karma:

Leader had actually already predicted that Baku might seek out Marco way in advance, so bombed the abandoned building to stop him (foresight). This was all to set up for Leader showing up to fight Carcal (strongest in the verse) and no diffing him right in front of Baku, making him believe that he was on his side, subtly manipulating him to choose him as an ally during Protoporos. Leader also engages in some quick public speaking outside the Tower just to farm feats in category.

Coffee Creamers Gamble:

Realising that Oofuna is actually way smarter than Baku, Hachina dresses up in his silly pajamas to make himself appear non-threating to Oofuna so he doesn't low diff him. Hachina and Oofuna arrive in the café, with both instantly reading Kidou as a gambler, but one within courage, unlike Madarame. Missing his pookie, Hachina doesn't even bother pretending to lose to Kidou, and uses Oofuna to pressure him into b
Betting all his money + the location of the Jalloud. Hachina employs a devious strategy, anticipating Kidou to use the Creamers, he had prepared all the Creamers to be numbers made of a malleable substance that only reacts to Hachina's fingertips, allowing him to chance the numbers at will. Using this strategy, Hachina gradually gaslights Kidou into insanity until he throws himself into the ocean to end it all. Little did Kidou know, Hachina had actually noticed a slight rush of adrenaline when Kidou threw himself into the ocean (EQ), and by inferring around where Kidou was looking when he fell, Hachina visualises the entire ocean to find that Kidou was actually looking straight at the Jalloud, conveniently leading him too his destination.

Battleship:

Fully analysing the situation (Analysis), Hachina concludes that he can just Oofuna handle the gamble. To make the gamble more interesting however, Hachina uses his knowledge of technology (knowledge) to hack Lacy's screen, allowing him to secretly play against Oofuna. After hours of intense gameplay (AC), the screens break due to the sheer concentrated aura of each player, ultimately leaving Oofuna and FN Souichi at a tie. Considering all the possible positions of Mogami's followers (VSI, thinking), Hachina expertly manipulates Lacy indirectly though Mogami. Hachina creates a note stating that Mogami should pretend that nothing is wrong with Lacy's screen, attaching his ID as the authentic Kakerou Leader, before acting like an obsessed Mogami supporter (acting skills) in front of one of the women to get them to transfer the message to them. As a result of this complex scheme of manipulations, Lacy throws himself overboard, where Hachina reveals a hidden secret: he had already prepared an underwater prison, predicting that Kidou and Lacy would try and drown themselves. Naturally, Hachina didn't actually want either to kill themselves to appeal to Oofuna's sense of justice so Hachina won't be deemed a criminal by him.

Protoporos:

As planned, Baku chooses Hal for Protoporos, expecting a landslide victory against Lalo. Just from the name of his organisation 'Ideal', Hal abduces that Lalo is planning to bring his men to the island, as that would be the 'ideal' scenario for him (reasoning). Using his god-like charisma, Hal convinces Robert K to stay on the island, causing Lalo to call off the entire scheme to find the island's location. However, Hal actually had an ulterior motive. Hal had sent a secret anonymous letter to Shoudo Kingdom in advance, inviting Nobuko to his location. Hal manipulates Robert K to give him one of Lalo's diamonds as soon as Nobuko arrives, who immediately falls in love with him. Deciding to get more diamonds to make Hal fall in love with her, Nobuko leads the entirety of Shoudo to steal Lalo's diamonds. This was all part of Hal's strategy to get Lalo to become enraged, seeking to kill Hal. But Hal had already gone into hiding on the island and no one could find him, so naturally Lalo began to chase Baku instead to kill him and end the match. As an insurance to allow for Baku's survival, Hal monopolises the market to give Baku access to an infinite supply of Kariume, allowing him to run away from Lalo until the match is over. This gives Hal ample time to rig the air poker gamble in advance, so that when Fukurou finally proposes the gamble to settle the ban match, he is already set to win.

Air Poker:

Hal uses echolocation to confirm Baku's position below him, and then taps out Morse code saying ""Baku, please marry me"". However, only Baku knows the secret code, and translates the message into ""Baku, they're empty"", meaning that the air bios were all emptied in advance. But then, Baku notices that one of his bios had been marked with a heart. Baku immediately concluded that Hal prepared one bio in advance specifically for Baku, which Hal had planted on his side. As Lalo descends from taking his final breath before the water fully rises, Baku attaches his air bio and closes his eyes, trying to limit any visual stimuli that could cause him to think unnecessarily and waste oxygen. This also serves to confuse Lalo, who wastes his oxygen at a faster rate trying to figure out Baku's scheme. Lalo takes a deep breath in... and breathes water. Rip Lalo.

1) as my most recent fail was due to junction observation which does not need 8 hours more lessons as my instructor is now just trying to get more money from me and I feel I am test-ready.
2) I spent around £2,500 on driving lessons and the test booking and travelling to Folkestone by train from Romford to get lessons as I found a test slot in Folkestone which was sooner than anywhere else, first attempt was on 15th January, second attempt was on 3rd February.


The Plan:
The Car: My own Nissan Qashqai (Automatic). It’s test-ready with L-plates and an extra rearview mirror.

Your Role: I am looking for someone to drive my car from my place in Romford to the test center (this is because if you don't trust me to drive my car with you in it). 
You can wait in the center for ~45 mins while I take the test, and then you can drive us back. 
I will only be driving my car during the actual exam with the examiner.

Insurance: I will pay for a Temporary Full Licence policy (via Veygo/Cuvva) for you for the day. I will have my own learner insurance for the test itself.

The Legal Bit: My car will have road tax set up as it is currently on SORN. It already has valid MOT until 15th December 2026.

Requirements (Crucial for Insurance):
Because of Cuvva insurance policy's ""supervisor"" rules, you must:
Be aged 25 or older.
Have held a full UK driving licence for at least 5 years.

I’m happy to meet at my residential car park in Romford beforehand to show you my provisional driver's licence and ID, the car’s V5C (in my name), and verify the insurance.

If you have a few hours to help me get my licence I'll really appreciate it, please drop me a DM. Happy to provide coffee/lunch for your time.
Let me know if you have any questions in DM.

Also why I'm asking on Reddit is because I'm alone in the UK, first generation immigrant in my family and have no friends/family who can help me, either they're too far away from where Iive in the UK or don't have driver's licence themselves.",1,1770393096.0,Romford,2,1.0,False

I've had a Breville Barista Express for about 7 years now and it finally broke so I am looking for an upgrade. I only drink lattes (milk based drinks) and I drink between 1-2 lattes a day. I considered myself to be pretty seasoned after dialing in beans on my Breville for the past 7 years but haven't worked on any of the fancy machines. I really like the features on the Diletta Alto Espresso Machine (being able to change the water temp and the flow control feature) but I'm concerned with it being manufactured by Seattle Coffee Gear and not being able to find anyone local to work on it if it ends up breaking. Also it would be a pain to have to ship it back to Seattle (I live on the East Coast). I've also thought about getting the La Marzocco Linea Mini which is a little outside of my budget but I wouldn't be opposed to paying more if it's a machine I will have for the rest of my life. Just concerned with that machine being so expensive just because of the name brand (I've heard it described as the BMW of espresso machines). I care more about functionality and durability over aesthetics. Can anyone help? Thanks!!,1,1770392939.0,espresso,3,0.66,False

When I came back, the doctors said I had an extreme allergic reaction to my medication and died for 7 minutes. They were able to somehow jumpstart my heart back into rhythm and here I am. I stayed in the hospital for at least a week for observation, as well as an allergy study because who knew Amoxicillin could end up killing you in the end. I’m home now, and there's something really, really wrong with it. When I got home, my apartment had this uncanny aura to it. It felt like I didn't belong here, like I didn't live here anymore. All my stuff was still there, nothing moved or out of place, but this weird aching feeling within the walls. It’s like my brain almost disassociated from my entire life after just 7 minutes. Anyways, besides the uncanny house, I’m also being followed. I noticed it when I went shopping last week. I was in the store grabbing my sleeveless hot pockets (because of course the government takes away the pocket in a hot pocket), and I saw something out of the corner of my eye. It was tall, unnaturally tall, and dark. As soon as I looked it was gone, but still, every single time I looked just slightly to either side, there it was, just standing there. I finished my shopping, and left that creepy ass store, maybe it was just one of those secret shoppers that monitor people to make sure they aren’t stealing. 



I went back home to my small apartment, sat on my second hand couch with my sleeveless hot pocket, and watched reruns of some tv show I didn't care to see the name of. I guess I ended up passing out at some point, cause next thing I knew I was sitting straight up, sweating bullets. I’ve never had a dream that fucked up, like really really fucked up. I was in the hospital again, kind of out of body, and I was right next to myself being resuscitated. There were at least 3 nurses and a doctor in the room, one doing compressions, one with the panels waiting and ready, another reading the heart and oxygen monitor, and the doctor standing there shouting out orders. It was just odd, everything was in slow motion, and it was all fuzzy, it was like I was moving underwater. The most I could do was look around, just slowly swiveling my head around. That's when I saw it, all of it. It was standing there, just outside the curtained room, staring. It was staring at ME, not my limp body laying on the table being revived, but me, my dream state self. It was feminine, I could only tell by its face. Its entire body was completely black except for its face. It had mid length hair that was slightly swaying like it was being blown gently or like it was underwater. Why could I clearly make out its face and nothing else, why was it staring at me like that, oh god it was looking right through me.  Its face was pure white, almost blindingly so. It was like looking at snow in the daylight, and it had this wide scrunched up smile, not like a ‘I’m happy to see you’ smile, it was different, I could feel the hatred and malice dripping off of this thing. The eyes were pitch black, just like the rest of its body, but I KNEW it was looking at me. Its stare was oppressive, uncomfortable, and so cruel. It was like I was the unnatural one for even being in its presence. I was just completely frozen, locked into what seemed like an infinite staring contest with this thing, and god did I want to look away but I couldn't, it felt like if i looked away it would be more of an offense than just being in front of it. That's when I woke up, it felt like my heart had just been hit by a train and given enough caffeine to kill a horse, it burned and felt like my heart was about to break out of my ribcage. Maybe my dream nurse had shocked me awake, back into the waking world, and I was just grateful that I was back in my dingy little apartment.



It’s been 3 weeks now. My dreams keep getting worse and worse, me being back in the hospital, either on the table dead or in another wing entirely, or in a black void with that thing's face being the other visible thing. One thing I know for sure is that it’s moving closer to me. Every time I go to sleep and see it, it’s inching closer and closer, and it's almost able to touch me now. I don’t want to go to sleep, I don’t want that thing to take me. It started whispering to me in my sleep, its face never moving but it is definitely, without a doubt in my mind, telling me that I belong to it, that I escaped from it and it’s coming to take me ‘home’. I don't know where the hell home is but I sure as hell don't want to find out. Maybe this can be a cautionary tale to warn people that Amoxicillin can potentially kill 1% of you, or that those who die and come back might not come back alone. I don’t know how much longer I can last, I’ve been awake for almost 82 hours, I’ve ran out of red bull and coffee, no one will give me stimulants to keep myself awake, and I can see that thing clearly now, standing in my kitchen just a few feet away from me, telling me it’s time to come home. I don’t want to go, but I feel like it’s almost inevitable now. I have a pocket knife I kept in my nightstand in my hand, and I know one thing is certain, I’m not going to go easily.

1qxl38l,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1qxl38l/when_do_i_make_a_change/,When do I make a change?,"I’ve been taking wellbutrin for almost 1 year (150xl). Today marks exactly 2 weeks since I upped my dose to 300xl. I knew there was going to be an adjustment period and some side effects until my body gets used to the higher dose. 

I want to preface that I take adderall 10mg xr as well, and on the days i don’t, I drink coffee. (i loveeee coffee but i don’t think i go overboard, only 1-2 max lattes a day.) But since upping my dose, drinking coffee has triggered very intense anxiety. Mostly physical symptoms though, like high heart rate, tightening chest, overheating, unable to slow breath. and on two occasions i think i actually

was having an anxiety attack. it is the absolute worst feeling, like my body thinks it’s dying. i know that im fine, but i can’t get my body to calm down. deep breathing doesn’t do much. 

The adderall doesn’t make me feel this way as much, but it’s still there. the only thing that relieves  this feeling is taking double my dose of propranolol (so 20mg). i’m prescribed it as needed for anxiety but i try to only save it for occasions that really make me nervous, like a job interview or something. obviously i dont want to rely on this regularly. 

Ik an obvious answer would be to quit caffeine, but i still need to take my adderall? i can’t really function without it. I also go to the gym at 6am so i NEED something, and i thought even drinking a tiny bit of espresso this morning would be okay, but nope i’m currently paying for it bad right now. 

Not related to the caffeine, but i’ve also been SUPER irritable and very on edge. the slightest things have been making me mad and it’s so unreasonable. like my boyfriend leaving a dirty dish in the sink made me soooo pissed off. and i know this is unreasonable but i can’t control these emotions. also being touched or bothered aggravates me. it’s like i just want to be left alone. 

I’ve also been dealing with horrible brain fog, not able to think of words and being very, very forgetful, misplacing things all the time. this is a side effect i had when i started wellbutrin in the first place, and this i can manage as i believe it will go away. 

My question is- should i contact my dr to get me lowered back down? have you guys felt similar side effects? how did you manage? is this something that went away for you, and should i give myself more time to try to adjust? 

I’m just paranoid the anxiety is going to get worse, as anxiety attacks are not something i struggled with before and i really don’t want to add that to the list of problems in my life. 

sorry for the long post, thanks for reading. ♡

1qxl2xk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttractionDynamics/comments/1qxl2xk/6_signs_youve_given_up_on_love_unintentionally/,6 signs you've given up on love unintentionally (and how to stop self-sabotaging),"Ever catch yourself saying “I’m just focusing on myself right now,” but deep down, feel numb every time someone mentions dating? A lot of people aren’t *consciously* done with love—but they’ve checked out quietly, over time. This isn’t about being dramatic or cynical. It’s more like: you’re still swiping, still replying to texts, but your heart’s not in it.  

This post breaks down 6 surprising signs that you might’ve given up on love without even realizing it. All backed by what psychology, books, and real-life research say—not just vibes.

**1. You rarely crush on anyone anymore**  
It’s not that everyone sucks. It’s more emotional burnout. According to Esther Perel, psychotherapist and author of *Mating in Captivity*, emotional numbness is often a defense mechanism after repeated disappointment. Your brain protects you by dulling excitement altogether. So instead of being excited, you feel…nothing.

**2. You sabotage good connections without knowing why**  
You ""forget"" to reply to someone kind. Or ghost someone who gave green-flag energy. According to Dr. Nicole LePera (The Holistic Psychologist), people with unresolved attachment wounds often unconsciously avoid stability, because it feels unfamiliar. If chaos and anxiety were your baseline, peace can feel fake.

**3. You treat dating like a chore, not a chance**  
If all dating feels like filling out forms and barely tolerable coffee chats, something’s off. Researchers at the University of Chicago found that people who feel cynical about love show lower motivation to try and less satisfaction when they do. You're not picky. You're exhausted and disengaged.

**4. You romanticize being alone, but not in a healthy way**  
There's a difference between solitude and resignation. Saying “I don’t need anyone” every time you’re tempted to hope again? Protective armor. Brené Brown calls this ""foreboding joy""—when we avoid hope because we're so scared of disappointment. It's safer to lower expectations than get hurt again.

**5. You tell yourself love is just luck or timing**  
Believing love is out of your control makes you passive. But research from Dr. Eli Finkel (*The All-or-Nothing Marriage*) shows intentional behaviors—like being curious, vulnerable, and responsive—predict romantic success more than timing or fate. If you’re not acting, you’re deciding by default.

**6. You feel uncomfortable witnessing intimacy in others**  
Cringing at happy couples or feeling bitter when friends share their wins might signal buried grief. A study published in *Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin* found that those who experience emotional fatigue from past love failures can develop aversion to displays of affection. It's not hate. It’s hidden longing.

If any of these feel too real, it’s not about blame. It’s about noticing. Awareness is the first step to healing. Real love starts with re-opening small parts of yourself—without forcing it. Healing your relationship with yourself is the ultimate prequel.

My NK is currently contact napping (1+ hours) twice a day. The baby snuggles are great, and I know this phase goes by so quick, so I’m trying to enjoy it. I’m having a hard time staying awake in a cool, dark room with a sound machine going though. By “hard time” I just mean I’m fighting myself to stay awake to the point that I’m a bit miserable. I’m not dozing off at all, safe sleep is a priority to me, and NK is getting great naps this way which is obviously most important.

I have pretty severe sleep apnea that’s currently going untreated (I haven’t found anything that works). I’m tired all day but it’s only during nap time that I’m miserable from the exhaustion. I’ve never been a coffee drinker and don’t eat or drink anything with much caffeine. I tried a few energy drinks back when I was contact napping with a previous NF, but they made me feel sick.

So I guess my question is, how can I combat this exhaustion? I keep a snack and drink next to me, and wear headphones so I can listen to a book, podcast, or scroll. Sometimes I’m so tired though that even that doesn’t work. I feel like the obvious answer is caffeine, so I need all the suggestions: drinks, supplements, etc. This all kind of sounds silly and obvious but I’m desperate for unique suggestions.

hey folks, figured i'd share some parking advice for the colonials women's game on friday, 02/07 at 3:00 pm. clearview arena hockey is honestly super fun, but the one real pain is getting on and especially off neville island. it's not the cost of parking you worry about, since the official lot is free, it's the traffic backing up on grand avenue when everyone leaves at once.  
  
first thing, i gotta mention prked. honestly, it's the best way to skip the official lot congestion and the whole island bottleneck. because the venue is on neville island, your best bet for a super fast exit is using prked to snag a local's driveway or garage right next to the rmu island sports center. even though official parking is free, paying a little on prked guarantees you a spot that lets you bypass the main lot's internal traffic line for a super fast jump onto the road when the game ends, and the walk is super short. way cheaper than sitting in a traffic jam for 30 minutes.  
  
the main and official way to go is the ample free parking available on-site at the rmu island sports center. all rmu athletic events offer free parking for fans, and they have a decent amount of space right outside the main entrance of clearview arena, which is super convenient for the short walk.  
  
the biggest tip i can give if you go with the free lot is all about timing and that island bottleneck. access is via i-79 or the yellow belt onto grand avenue, and that's where you'll hit traffic, both before and after. for a 3:00 pm puck drop, honestly aim to be on neville island by 2:15 pm - 2:30 pm. this lets you snag a close free spot and miss the main traffic wave coming over the bridge right before the game.  
  
problem avoidance: if you park in the main free lots, getting off neville island right after the final horn can be a slow crawl. your best problem avoidance move is to hang out at the icehouse bistro for a bit and let the initial wave of cars clear out instead of sitting in the exit line. they have coffee and pub fare there.  
  
also, don't bother looking for street parking near the complex- it's on a sports center property, so it's not a real option like it is in the city. just focus on getting to the rmu island sports center lot or finding a faster prked spot for a quick exit.  
  
hope this helps everyone enjoy the game!</blockquote>",1,1770392434.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around some tables and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Each week we typically get a mix of regulars, people who drop by occasionally and a few newbies.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo ](https://postimg.cc/B8vN5xJc)). The bar staff also know who we are if you're not sure.

There's an optional Whatsapp group for the meetup -it's pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. If you really do want to join it just ask around at the meetup.",2,1770392412.0,LondonSocialClub,1,1.0,False

hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking tips for mr. jeff at the knight stage on 02/07. that 2:30 pm matinee on a saturday is a little tricky. it's not bad traffic-wise, but everyone aims for the same few spots, and it gets messy fast near showtime.  
  
honestly, your best bet to skip all the nonsense is Prked. it's this app where people right next to the civic theatre rent out their private driveways or empty garage spots. it's way cheaper than the garages sometimes and you totally skip the main street traffic jam. you walk maybe two or three minutes and you're there. seriously saves a ton of stress.  
  
if you want the traditional route, the akron civic theatre deck is the most convenient since the knight stage is attached. but warning, it fills up super early. you need to get there like an hour ahead of the 2:30 pm start time or you're gonna be stuck in a line backing up main street. i'd avoid it unless you plan to be extra early. your better garage alternatives are the cascade parking garage or the high-market garage. they're only a slightly longer walk, maybe 5-7 minutes, and they're usually cheaper and always have space. also look at the summit county parking deck, it’s another option sometimes used for overflow. street parking on s. main or high street is around, but spots are really limited, especially right near the theater, and you can’t rely on finding one. always check meter signs if you go that route just in case, but saturday afternoons are usually the wild west for those few spots. traffic won't be as bad as a weekday rush hour, but coming in a half hour before the 2:30 pm start time is asking for a traffic bottleneck around the theatre entrance. get there early and grab lunch or a coffee downtown instead of circling for parking.

1qxkxhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qxkxhv/the_attention_span_crisis_nobodys_talking_about/,The Attention Span Crisis Nobody's Talking About (and the Science-Based Fix),"Your brain isn't broken. But it's probably been hijacked.

I spent months researching this after realizing I couldn't finish a single chapter without checking my phone. Turns out, this isn't just a ""me"" problem. The average attention span has dropped from 12 seconds in 2000 to 8 seconds today. Goldfish officially beat us at 9 seconds. But here's what I found digging through neuroscience research, podcasts with cognitive scientists, and books from people who've actually studied this stuff, our brains are incredibly adaptable. We can rebuild what's been eroded.

The issue isn't willpower. It's that we're fighting billion dollar algorithms designed to fragment our focus. Social media platforms literally employ behavioral psychologists to make their apps more addictive. Your biology is being weaponized against you. But once you understand the mechanics, you can reverse the damage.

**Start with dopamine detoxing, but make it actually sustainable.** Dr. Anna Lembke's book Dopamine Nation completely changed how I think about this. She's a psychiatrist and addiction expert at Stanford, and the book hit the NYT bestseller list for good reason. She explains how our brains are wired for a delicate pleasure/pain balance, but constant stimulation from phones, social media, and streaming has thrown everything off. We're essentially in a state of chronic dopamine overload. Her solution isn't some extreme monk mode BS. It's about creating ""dopamine fasting"" windows where you deliberately avoid high stimulation activities. I started with just 1 hour in the morning, no phone, no music, no podcasts. Just existing. Sounds unbearable at first, but your brain recalibrates faster than you'd think. Within two weeks I could actually sit with my thoughts without losing my mind.

**Train your brain like a muscle with deliberate focus sessions.** Cal Newport talks about this extensively in Deep Work, which is basically the bible for anyone trying to unfuck their attention span. Newport's a computer science professor at Georgetown who's written multiple bestsellers on productivity. The core concept is treating focused work as a skill you deliberately practice. Start absurdly small. Set a timer for 20 minutes and work on ONE thing. No email. No Slack. No ""just quickly checking"" anything. When your brain screams for distraction (and it will), notice the urge but don't act on it. Write it down if you need to. This is literally rewiring your neural pathways. The Pomodoro technique works here too, 25 minutes of focus, 5 minute break. But the key is genuine single tasking during those 25 minutes. Most people think they're focused when they're really just rapidly task switching.

**Rebuild your reading stamina through incremental exposure.** This one's personal because I used to inhale books as a kid, then suddenly couldn't get past page 10 without my mind wandering. [Neuroscientist Maryanne Wolf](https://www.maryannewolf.com/) (she literally wrote the book on reading and the brain called Reader, Come Home) explains that deep reading creates unique neural circuits. But these circuits atrophy when we only engage in skimming and scrolling. Her advice is counterintuitive, start with short form content you actually enjoy, but read it on paper. Physical books or printed articles. The lack of hyperlinks and notifications makes a massive difference. I started with 10 pages a day of anything, fiction, nonfiction, whatever held my interest. No pressure to retain or analyze. Just the act of sustained reading. After a month I was back to finishing books.

If sitting down with physical books feels like too much friction right now, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), a personalized learning app that turns books, research papers, and expert insights into custom audio podcasts. Built by former Google engineers and Columbia grads, it pulls from sources like the ones mentioned here (Dopamine Nation, Deep Work, neuroscience research) and tailors them to your exact goals, like ""rebuild my attention span as someone who can't focus for 5 minutes."" You control the depth, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives when something clicks. The voice options are genuinely addictive, there's even a smoky, sarcastic style that makes learning feel less like work. It creates a structured learning plan that evolves with you, and you can ask questions mid-episode or customize what you want to focus on next. Perfect for commutes or gym time when you want to grow but doom-scrolling feels easier.

The app Readwise can help here too, it resurfaces highlights from stuff you've read, which reinforces the neural pathways and makes reading feel more rewarding.

**Protect your sleep like your attention depends on it, because it does.** [Dr. Matthew Walker's](https://www.sleepdiplomat.com/)Why We Sleep is legitimately one of the most important books I've read. He's a neuroscience professor at UC Berkeley and his research on sleep's impact on cognitive function is pretty alarming. Even one night of poor sleep significantly impairs your prefrontal cortex, which is exactly the part of your brain responsible for focus and impulse control. Basically, when you're sleep deprived, you have zero chance of maintaining attention. His recommendation is non negotiable 7-9 hours, consistent sleep schedule, cool dark room, no screens an hour before bed. I use the Insight Timer app for guided sleep meditations when my brain won't shut up. It's free and has thousands of options, way better than paying for Calm or Headspace.

**Reclaim your morning before the chaos starts.** This isn't some rise and grind hustle culture thing, it's about giving your brain a fighting chance. The first hour after waking up is when your prefrontal cortex is most capable of focused work. But most of us immediately drown it in emails, news, and social media. That's like running a marathon before breakfast and wondering why you're exhausted. Try this for one week, phone stays in another room overnight, airplane mode until you've done at least one meaningful task in the morning. For me that's writing or reading. Sometimes it's just sitting with coffee and planning my day. But it's MY time before the world makes demands. The difference in mental clarity is insane.

**Create friction for distractions, make focus the path of least resistance.** Delete social media apps from your phone. You can still access them via browser, but that extra step matters. Use website blockers like Freedom or Cold Turkey during work sessions. Put your phone in another room. Sounds dramatic but physical distance actually works. The goal isn't perfection, it's making distraction slightly harder than staying focused. Your brain will naturally follow the easiest path.

The uncomfortable truth is that rebuilding your attention span requires consistently choosing short term discomfort for long term gain. But neuroplasticity is real. Your brain will adapt. You just have to give it the conditions to do so.",1,1770392336.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

1qxkwvl,https://i.redd.it/7lh8huu89whg1.jpeg,Confession,"I confess. When I was flat broke, I tampered with the water meter. You would too if you had to sit in a house without water. Your skin becomes sticky to the point that you could grow arrowroots on it. And the toilet? Let’s not start with the toilet. 

Nothing helps, not wrinkling your nose, covering it with the front neck-drop of your t-shirt, or opening all the windows. You still can’t stand your own shit. So you see, I had to tamper with the water meter.

I could no longer rely on rainwater. By virtue of dirty corrugated roofs, the water was always dirty and only good for the toilet. And, because it was around September, it was unreliable. I also couldn’t borrow from my neighbors anymore. So I had to tamper with the water meter.

It’s not what you think. I didn’t tamper with it so that the good people over at Nairobi Water could charge me less, no. After they had switched it off and left, I simply went back and switched it back on. They usually carried the water thingamajig that opened the taps, and it was cheaper to replace than to pay the bill.

The bill was three thousand bob, the thingamajig, four hundred bob. The only problem was that I would usually get a full-blown shower when replacing it, and the whole time, my heart was racing because I had to be the lookout as well as the plumber.

I confess. When I was flat broke, I tampered with the water meter, but I didn’t tamper with the electricity meter, so it’s ridiculous that it was the one that got me in trouble. 

How could I tamper with the electricity meter when I heard stories of people who had died by its cruel hand? The craven in me wouldn’t even allow me to get close to the switchboard. When they switched off my lights, I usually picked a stick and walked to the main socket board, hands trembling, poke the stick inside, and turn my juice back on.

After months of flipping the switch on after they had switched it off, Kenya Power finally got tired of the Tom and Jerry games and carried away my fuse. And to think we were having so much fun. That forced me to pay. They brought down one of their technicians to fix it, but that’s not what got me into trouble.

Lights Out
You see, the main socket of my house used to make these noises as if it were full of bees. (Irony for a house that smelled like a honey sucker truck.) I never paid too much attention to these sounds, not when I was busy trying to earn a living. The noises came and went, and after two years, my neighbors left and the noises with them. Did I mention they had a clan of people living with them? 

After they vacated, the grapevine was rank with rumors that they had left a hefty bill behind, one that rang to the tune of forty thousand bob. When the rumor first touched my ears, I thought, “Wueh, glad that’s not my problem,” and slept like a baby that night. God was probably smiling, knowing that in a cruel twist of fate, I would soon be on the hook for it.

Turns out, my other neighbor, the one who lived downstairs, was also not diligent enough to pay her electricity bill, and it had climbed to a figure of twenty thousand bob. She would bribe Kenya Power every so often to have her juice turned back on. That news got to the landlady’s ear, and she came down with a technician in tow to put a plug on the madness. It was then that I was told that the meter that I was paying for was dormant, and the one that I was using was my neighbor’s, the one with forty thousand on its tab.

I still remember that night. I was on my sofa, I think, reading a book or wondering what else I could sell. My two-seater sofa? The carpet? The doors? They were looking especially attractive. Did I really need three doors in a one-bedroom house? You see, I’m generally a good person, but you will be surprised to what extremes the carnal need for survival will push a human being.

I was having these thoughts when my lights went off. “Goddamit, I just paid for that,” I thought. I got up, pushed back my curtain, and other houses were illuminated. Come to think of it, did I really need curtains? I knew someone was playing peekaboo with the meter, so I stormed out, my anger rising, ready to fight them. Okay, I’m not a fighter, so, cough a small roar at them.

Landlady
“Sorry, Kevin,” my landlady, a middle-aged light-skinned woman, apologized. “We are just doing a routine check; your electricity will be back shortly.” I turned my back, but before I could put one foot in front of the other, she asked me to bring her a pen and paper. I still insist I’m a good person; even when I was tampering with the water meter, I was doing it for a higher cause. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, not my words. I went back into the house and came back with the pen and paper. It was when I was going down the stairs that I realized I might be bringing the stove that was going to cook me.

“This is a terrible person. You mean he switched meters with the neighbor who vacated?” she was telling the technician in Kikuyu. I gulped because I wouldn’t know the first thing about switching meters. Not with my trembling hands and fear of electricity.

“Umekua ukitumia meter ya jirani, eh?” she went off after I presented her the pen and paper.

“Ati?” I felt a pang of pain race across my chest.

“Eh, unajua chenye umekua ukifanya. Nikiwasha meter ya jirani yako stima zinawaka kwako?”

I scratched my head, wondering how she had moved from an angel to a Tasmanian Devil.

“Sasa ujue vile utajipanga hio bill ulipe.”

“I have been paying my bill.” I switched to English, knowing I did not have the misamiati to address the problem in Swahili.

“You have been paying the wrong bill,” the landlady barked.

“I have been paying the bill for the meter number you gave me when I moved here,” I stammered. I usually stammer when I’m livid.

“How does that matter when you have switched the meters, eh?” She pointed a finger at me. “Ujue vile utajipanga hio bill ilipwe.”

“I have all the M-Pesa texts,” I said, her words flying over my head.

“You have to pay the bill for the meter you have been using.“ Her voice had hit a crescendo.

“I have all the M-Pesa texts,” I repeated myself like a broken record.

“Forward me those M-Pesa texts tupatane asubuhi. Either you pay, or it becomes a police case.”

I think I went upstairs mumbling, “I have all the M-Pesa texts.” And thinking I cannot survive prison. I mean, I’m not a fighter, the much I can do is cough a small roar.

Moving
I got into the house, and it finally came full circle. I had bitten more than I could chew. I was barely getting by. I had sold my TV, my fridge, my coffee table, and there was nothing else left to sell that could settle that bill. I made the decision to make for the village then.

The following morning, I called a taxi. The driver was this ragtag who drove a Fielder. I had paid for his services when selling my fridge to Kimende, so I knew he would be up for the gig.

It was a Saturday morning when I moved out. I had woken up early and done the hard work of packing everything into manageable luggage. My books, clothes, buckets, two-burner cooker, gas cylinder, TV-stand, carpet, curtains, mattress, and the bed that I had already taken apart. I left behind my sofa and kitchen table. They couldn’t fit into the Fielder, and besides, my good side insisted I leave them behind to cover that month’s rent.

It was a sixth sense by now, looking out the window to make sure no one was sniffing anything while I was doing sleazy work. There was no one sniffing around except for a few kids playing outside who I gladly gave the mattress, the carpet, and the buckets to ferry downstairs.

“Are you moving out?” one of them asked.

“No, I’m just going away for a few days. I will be back,” I heard myself say, and he raised an eyebrow, probably already used to adult lies.

I was breathing hard and turning my neck this way and that when the ignition of the Fielder roared and we left the premises, heading for our construction site, where I would offload my belongings. “Ungeniambia.” The ragtag driver was smiling, looking at me with red-hot, alcohol eyes full of pride. “Ungeniambia ningekusaidia.”

“Kanyaga mafuta,” was all I said. All the while in my head, the phrase, ‘I have all the M-Pesa texts’ was replaying.

I knew that, unlike the common mwananchi, morning for my landlady meant 10 or 11 am. She would be coming to discuss an electricity bill of forty thousand bob with the wind because by then I was in a matatu going sixty km/hr headed for Murang’a. I confess.

Prior to that, we were close friends for a year. We have a lot of common interests and have great conversations.

I'll add a bit of context on each of us. She is pretty anxious and introverted. She doesn't have many (any?) friends. I've invited her for coffee, dinner, etc with me and my friends plenty of times, but she doesn't like them (she thinks they're too boring, or too moralistic, or have too messy of a personal life) and doesn't join us, so I've stopped asking. 

Her hobbies are mostly solitary: she likes watching anime, reading, drawing, cooking, things like that. When we spend time together, we usually cook and eat, and watch something or talk. I've tried planning biweekly date nights, but she's usually tired from work (understandably so) and doesn't feel up to going out to eat. 

The issue at hand is that I feel like our communication is a disaster. In December, I initiated a conversation about how I felt like she wasn't putting enough effort into our relationship. I make a habit of doing a few small things for her: buying her flowers or chocolate, bringing her things I've baked, picking up things she needs from the grocery store. They're all small but she's expressed that she appreciates them, but she doesn't really do anything like that for me. 

That conversation went poorly. It went on for several hours, somehow, and she talked a lot about her past friendships and relationships, but we never got to a concrete point of her saying, ""Here are some things I am going to do to put in more effort."" She did, afterwards, get me flowers one time and make dinner for us another time. That was sweet and I thanked her for both but there hasn't been a repeat of either occurence.

Recently, I brought up to her that I noticed she got anxious when we talk about serious things concerning us. I asked her if there's anything I can do to make her less anxious. That again turned into a multi-hout discussion of her past relationships with no concrete response at the end. I brought up that I feel tired from doing all the 'maintenance' work of our relationship and she said she understood and that was it. No follow-up. 

Yesterday we had a long and convoluted argument over text and I feel like I officially lost my patience. I said that I need her to listen better and not get defensive when I say that something she did hurt me. She went on a philosophical tangent about communication and apologies. When I tried to clarify what I was hurt about, she got hung up on a particular word I had used and refused to apologize until I had apologized for not being careful enough with my language.

I feel so done. I feel like I could just eat crow and ignore things so we can stay together. But honestly, things haven't been good since the summer. I've been waiting on her for a long time. She's a really special person and when things are good, they're so good. But I'm realizing that for things to be good, I have to ignore a lot. She hasn't been in many relationships, and neither have I, and I'm sure I could be a lot better about communicating my feelings and needs. But it just doesn't feel like she wants to hear it.

I guess I'm looking to hear whether this is worth salvaging and how. Looking forward to hearing everyone's thoughts.

TLDR: My (23m) girlfriend (25f) of one year doesn't out effort into our relationship and doesn't react well (makes the conversation about her feelings instead) when I bring up my feelings about it. ",1,1770392185.0,relationships,4,1.0,False
1qxkuzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qxkuzd/even_after_letting_go_of_the_last_bird_i_hesitate/,"Even after letting go of the last bird I hesitate, There is something in this empty cage that never gets released.","So now I've officially remembered her longer than I've known her. We'll not exactly, I met her at a party I threw for my mom's birthday few years back. She lives near my house, she's a family friend. Started talking regularly to her in 2023 when I replied to her WhatsApp status about a book she was reading. Oh she loves reading a lot. The first message I ever sent her was on 1st January 2023 after we were added in a group and for some reason, even after only vaguely knowing each other, saved each other's numbers. 
I texted something about the book Verity by Colleen when she posted a page from it on WhatsApp. 

Oh we talked in PARAGRAPHS. After that we discussed about the book for some time as she kept reading it. Same year after sometime I discovered a book called Dark Matter by Blake Crouch. I read it in like 2-3 days (working days) and just fell in love with the writing and everything. I recommended it to her, offered her the copy I bought, but she denied, maybe she wanted to keep some boundaries because exchanging books you love with someone else or lending them to someone means something. I don't know exactly what, but it did to her atleast. She downloaded a copy of the book and read it and she liked it too. So much so that she gifted it to her best friend on her birthday and bought a copy for herself too. 

Fast forward, we talked periodically, I'd message her, and she'd reply after like 5-6 hours and sometimes more. I'd always eagerly wait for her messages. I always replied almost instantly or maybe like after 10 minutes or so. I was a rat of a human being who had no shame and was shamelessly feeding on the breadcrumbs of the conversations she was throwing at me. After a while I started romanticising even that. I used to say it feels like I'm sending a letter through a pegion and have no idea when and what will I get a reply. The same year we exchanged instagram IDs on my birthday which comes shortly after new year. I used to send her memes and reels and chat there a lot with her too. We started going on walks after dinner at night, never alone though. She'd always check if there was someone else, maybe my sister, or her brother, or some mutual friends going with us too. We'd walk faster than the group and talk while going on long walks. I had my convocation ceremony on the day after her birthday and I was in a different city for submitting my final year project and giving my presentation. I ordered a book for her birthday called Acts of God by Kanan Gill, he was her favourite comedian and performer. I completed the project formalities and skipped my convocation ceremony to attend her birthday. I packed the book in a big cardboard box that I practically stole from an under construction shop. It was the first gift she opened sitting at the back seat of my car which I was driving and there were obviously 3 more people other than us in the car. She liked it a lot and thanked me. 
It was going great and I developed an habit of her. A habit of someone to talk to and listen to. Talk about good days, bad days, discuss about things, people, life, friends, government everything. She is a law student, I'm a computer science and robotics student, I started reading law so I can hold conversations with her. I also bought her a book which she wanted for a long time but it was not available online called ""Five people you meet in heaven"". I wanted to give it as a gift, but she insisted that she wants to pay for it. I asked maybe she can buy me a coffee but she said she'd rather just pay me the money. That hurt but I didn't look too much into it. Like I did but I kinda ignored that it's not a big deal.

Skip forward to next year, 2024 Feburary 6th, that is 2 years ago today, I'm out for a walk, alone, with two roses hidden my jacket. It was a very cold night. I wanted to give her roses and ask her for a date. In some dumb little corner of my heart, I was thinking about having a valentine for the first time in my life. Also, this decision wasn't random, before this, we went to a party 3 months ago and she looks really stunning in the dress she was wearing but there some of her friends from long ago from middle school so we didn't talk in the party and I had to leave early because of some issue I don't remember. I saw her instagram story in that dress and typed a reply to it that read ""You are looking absolutely stunning and beautiful in that dress, it's a shame I had to leave the party early."" It was corny, but before this I never complimented her seriously, or rather, she always tuned my compliments into jokes and laughs. I took a coin, and I said if this coin lands 3 out of 5 heads, I'm sending this message thinking it's a sign. I'm an atheist, I don't believe in God, I don't believe in an entity that is controlling everything or whatever, but at that moment, I looked at that coin, and as I was tossing it, somewhere I was paying. I don't know to whom, but I was. I still remember the outcome was [H, H, T, H, H]. I got 4/5 heads I was aiming for 3. I sent it, she didn't turn it into a joke this time, we talked the whole night, we even played truth or dare online, just the two of us, on text. Wasn't anything crazy, just talked about relationships, friendships etc. 
Cut to 6th February 2024 23:45 hours. I'm out of the house for about half an hour, trying to gather courage to throw these roses into her balcony. I called one of my friends, I told him what I want to do, he encouraged me, I went past her house 10 different times, didn't do it. At 23:55 he told me, ""man you are not Batman and you'll never be. You know why? Because Batman was many things, lonely, untrusting, mysterious, someone who fell in love hard but ultimately failed, all of which your stupid ass believes is common with you, but he wasn't a scared little baby like you."" And hung up the phone.
He said this because me and her had a running joke about ""I'm Batman"" and so I attached a small slip with the flowers that read ""From Batman, to the world's most wonderful woman.""

I stood in front of her house, I practiced throwing the roses before at my balcony so I know how to make the throw. A dog came by and just sat down beside me. As if reassuring me, telling me it'll be fine, I'm here. Go ahead, I'll help you if something goes wrong. Obviously the dog didn't say it, but I heard it by his actions. I threw the roses, they went to her balcony and landed perfectly near the door. I ran to my house, texted her that she should check out the moon outside. It's looking really pretty today. I was at the roof of my house, looking at her balcony, there was a tree blocking my view, but she was kinda visible. She picked them up, told me ""hey, I found these in the balcony, where did they come from??""
I told her to pick them up and check them, she played around for a bit and then took them in. She asked me if this is some prank or something? I said no I just wanted to give you some flowers. She asked why? I said today's 7th February, rose day. She said ohh. And all you had to say was from Batman? So I lied to her and said there was also a letter attached but I didn't reach the balcony so I'll give it tomorrow. Next day I wrote a letter to her, confessing that I like her. It was a very personal letter, I went all in, most vulnerable I've been my entire life. Did the whole nervous dance from yesterday again, threw it, she read it, said she'll reply next day she needs some time to think.

Now I had a very important exam on 10th February. And the whole day on 7th, I barely studied or revised anything. At the evening, she said I never looked at you in this way, we should rather be friends I want to focus more on my studies for now.

I broke down, I said I understand, and it's alright. I cried a lot, in front of the mirror, on my study table, in the shower, everywhere. I went down and layed next to my mom, I wanted to hold her and cry like a little baby. I wanted to do this so bad, I wanted to tell her that I hate everything and everyone, and I want her to do something to make my heart stop aching. But I didn't. I didn't because I knew that'll just ruin all the dynamics between mine and her family, and this will be out in the open, and everybody would know I'm a loser. So I just layed next to her, holding back my tears with all my life force. I calmed myself down, and I finally went back to my room. I didn't close my door for the first time since I got a personal room, because somewhere in my subconscious I was afraid of myself. I was afraid of something I didn't know or see. I was afraid of the dark and the books that used to always comfort me. Didn't sleep or eat for a week. Barely passed the exam. 

After that I still used to message her, thinking because of my fault, she shouldn't suffer, she shouldn't lose a friend. The truth is I was the only one who went out with a loss out of this. After a while, I just stopped texting her. And the next year, in 2025, she blocked me from everywhere, snapchat, instagram, whatsapp everywhere. So I blocked her back. Then she deactivated the instagram account on which we used to chat a hell lot more than whatsapp and made a new account. So now I have a chat in my Instagram without a name or a photo or any of the messages that she sent, just my messages. Representing the kind of a one sided relationship we had.

It's valentine's week again, I have an exam on 8th this time. Only difference, I'm alone, and instead of remembering formulas, I'm having flashbacks of every little thing about her. So now I am writing everything down here, I've revisited these memories for the last time. I'm done carrying the bullshit I did. I have leaned my lesson, I'll never lose again. Not in this shit again atleast.

I hope she had instead ended it by being cruel to me. Because then I would have had something to hate her. My heart would have given me the permission to hate her. But she didn't, she was kind, she was careful. I always held her in my memories as someone who cared. She's a ghost whom I can't touch or talk to, but keeps creeping upto me on random days and times and making me freak out.

It hurts that she never gave me a reason to stop loving her, so now I can never even imagine falling in love with someone else.

Sorry for writing all of this I just wanted to get through all of it for once so I can focus on studying again. I've been so distracted today that I lost 10 chess games in a row and forgot everything I read today. Hopefully tomorrow I'll be at peace and do well at the exam on 8th.",1,1770392183.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1qxkug3,https://i.redd.it/9n3dlzds8whg1.jpeg,Confession,"I confess. When I was flat broke, I tampered with the water meter. You would too if you had to sit in a house without water. Your skin becomes sticky to the point that you could grow arrowroots on it. And the toilet? Let’s not start with the toilet. 

Nothing helps, not wrinkling your nose, covering it with the front neck-drop of your t-shirt, or opening all the windows. You still can’t stand your own shit. So you see, I had to tamper with the water meter.

I could no longer rely on rainwater. By virtue of dirty corrugated roofs, the water was always dirty and only good for the toilet. And, because it was around September, it was unreliable. I also couldn’t borrow from my neighbors anymore. So I had to tamper with the water meter.

It’s not what you think. I didn’t tamper with it so that the good people over at Nairobi Water could charge me less, no. After they had switched it off and left, I simply went back and switched it back on. They usually carried the water thingamajig that opened the taps, and it was cheaper to replace than to pay the bill.

The bill was three thousand bob, the thingamajig, four hundred bob. The only problem was that I would usually get a full-blown shower when replacing it, and the whole time, my heart was racing because I had to be the lookout as well as the plumber.

I confess. When I was flat broke, I tampered with the water meter, but I didn’t tamper with the electricity meter, so it’s ridiculous that it was the one that got me in trouble. 

How could I tamper with the electricity meter when I heard stories of people who had died by its cruel hand? The craven in me wouldn’t even allow me to get close to the switchboard. When they switched off my lights, I usually picked a stick and walked to the main socket board, hands trembling, poke the stick inside, and turn my juice back on.

After months of flipping the switch on after they had switched it off, Kenya Power finally got tired of the Tom and Jerry games and carried away my fuse. And to think we were having so much fun. That forced me to pay. They brought down one of their technicians to fix it, but that’s not what got me into trouble.

Lights Out
You see, the main socket of my house used to make these noises as if it were full of bees. (Irony for a house that smelled like a honey sucker truck.) I never paid too much attention to these sounds, not when I was busy trying to earn a living. The noises came and went, and after two years, my neighbors left and the noises with them. Did I mention they had a clan of people living with them? 

After they vacated, the grapevine was rank with rumors that they had left a hefty bill behind, one that rang to the tune of forty thousand bob. When the rumor first touched my ears, I thought, “Wueh, glad that’s not my problem,” and slept like a baby that night. God was probably smiling, knowing that in a cruel twist of fate, I would soon be on the hook for it.

Turns out, my other neighbor, the one who lived downstairs, was also not diligent enough to pay her electricity bill, and it had climbed to a figure of twenty thousand bob. She would bribe Kenya Power every so often to have her juice turned back on. That news got to the landlady’s ear, and she came down with a technician in tow to put a plug on the madness. It was then that I was told that the meter that I was paying for was dormant, and the one that I was using was my neighbor’s, the one with forty thousand on its tab.

I still remember that night. I was on my sofa, I think, reading a book or wondering what else I could sell. My two-seater sofa? The carpet? The doors? They were looking especially attractive. Did I really need three doors in a one-bedroom house? You see, I’m generally a good person, but you will be surprised to what extremes the carnal need for survival will push a human being.

I was having these thoughts when my lights went off. “Goddamit, I just paid for that,” I thought. I got up, pushed back my curtain, and other houses were illuminated. Come to think of it, did I really need curtains? I knew someone was playing peekaboo with the meter, so I stormed out, my anger rising, ready to fight them. Okay, I’m not a fighter, so, cough a small roar at them.

Landlady
“Sorry, Kevin,” my landlady, a middle-aged light-skinned woman, apologized. “We are just doing a routine check; your electricity will be back shortly.” I turned my back, but before I could put one foot in front of the other, she asked me to bring her a pen and paper. I still insist I’m a good person; even when I was tampering with the water meter, I was doing it for a higher cause. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, not my words. I went back into the house and came back with the pen and paper. It was when I was going down the stairs that I realized I might be bringing the stove that was going to cook me.

“This is a terrible person. You mean he switched meters with the neighbor who vacated?” she was telling the technician in Kikuyu. I gulped because I wouldn’t know the first thing about switching meters. Not with my trembling hands and fear of electricity.

“Umekua ukitumia meter ya jirani, eh?” she went off after I presented her the pen and paper.

“Ati?” I felt a pang of pain race across my chest.

“Eh, unajua chenye umekua ukifanya. Nikiwasha meter ya jirani yako stima zinawaka kwako?”

I scratched my head, wondering how she had moved from an angel to a Tasmanian Devil.

“Sasa ujue vile utajipanga hio bill ulipe.”

“I have been paying my bill.” I switched to English, knowing I did not have the misamiati to address the problem in Swahili.

“You have been paying the wrong bill,” the landlady barked.

“I have been paying the bill for the meter number you gave me when I moved here,” I stammered. I usually stammer when I’m livid.

“How does that matter when you have switched the meters, eh?” She pointed a finger at me. “Ujue vile utajipanga hio bill ilipwe.”

“I have all the M-Pesa texts,” I said, her words flying over my head.

“You have to pay the bill for the meter you have been using.“ Her voice had hit a crescendo.

“I have all the M-Pesa texts,” I repeated myself like a broken record.

“Forward me those M-Pesa texts tupatane asubuhi. Either you pay, or it becomes a police case.”

I think I went upstairs mumbling, “I have all the M-Pesa texts.” And thinking I cannot survive prison. I mean, I’m not a fighter, the much I can do is cough a small roar.

Moving
I got into the house, and it finally came full circle. I had bitten more than I could chew. I was barely getting by. I had sold my TV, my fridge, my coffee table, and there was nothing else left to sell that could settle that bill. I made the decision to make for the village then.

The following morning, I called a taxi. The driver was this ragtag who drove a Fielder. I had paid for his services when selling my fridge to Kimende, so I knew he would be up for the gig.

It was a Saturday morning when I moved out. I had woken up early and done the hard work of packing everything into manageable luggage. My books, clothes, buckets, two-burner cooker, gas cylinder, TV-stand, carpet, curtains, mattress, and the bed that I had already taken apart. I left behind my sofa and kitchen table. They couldn’t fit into the Fielder, and besides, my good side insisted I leave them behind to cover that month’s rent.

It was a sixth sense by now, looking out the window to make sure no one was sniffing anything while I was doing sleazy work. There was no one sniffing around except for a few kids playing outside who I gladly gave the mattress, the carpet, and the buckets to ferry downstairs.

“Are you moving out?” one of them asked.

“No, I’m just going away for a few days. I will be back,” I heard myself say, and he raised an eyebrow, probably already used to adult lies.

I was breathing hard and turning my neck this way and that when the ignition of the Fielder roared and we left the premises, heading for our construction site, where I would offload my belongings. “Ungeniambia.” The ragtag driver was smiling, looking at me with red-hot, alcohol eyes full of pride. “Ungeniambia ningekusaidia.”

“Kanyaga mafuta,” was all I said. All the while in my head, the phrase, ‘I have all the M-Pesa texts’ was replaying.

I knew that, unlike the common mwananchi, morning for my landlady meant 10 or 11 am. She would be coming to discuss an electricity bill of forty thousand bob with the wind because by then I was in a matatu going sixty km/hr headed for Murang’a. I confess. When I was flat broke, I tampered with the water meter, but I didn’t tamper with the electricity meter.

1qxkluj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1qxkluj/my_husband_is_overly_critical_of_small_things/,My husband is overly critical of small things around the house and it drives me insane,"I am a SAHM to a 10 month old. I am married to a wonderful man but he grew up in a home that was very slow and methodical with how they do everything. He’s never been mean about it but some days it feels like he goes looking for things to criticize, I am wondering if there could be some OCD at play. I don’t even think he fully knows how it comes off. It’s the only tension point in our marriage.

I know where he gets it - I have watched his mom make dinner and it often takes her 4+ hours to cook something that should take 40 minutes tops. I was raised in the opposite style home where both my parents worked in corporate and everything was about maximum efficiency because we didn’t have a ton of free time. We weren’t able to be late. With a son who’s now mobile and a baby on the way, I don’t have time to be hyperfocusing on these sorts of things or else nothing else would get done.

He’s the type of man that would rather have 20% of things done at 100% whereas I’m not sure if it’s just a female thing, but I feel like that’s unrealistic and would rather have 100% of things done at 70%. I have brought this up to him. When I was pregnant and couldn’t wash the dishes without feeling sick, he’d often take over an hour to scrub the dishes after a meal, making sure he wiped away every last hard water spot on every spoon and glass BEFORE putting them in the dishwasher. Here’s some examples of issues this week:

• We cloth diaper to save money and be more sustainable, he insists I need to be cleaning and scrubbing every diaper instead of soaking. When he’s home and changes a diaper he will do this process himself and it takes him 20 minutes per diaper. Nobody I know has done it this way.

•We live in an area with hard water and he has an obsession with water spots for whatever reason. I have gotten to the point where I’m wiping off his dishes with my shirt before placing them on his spot because I know he’s going to get anxious and have to go wash them if I don’t, despite the fact they aren’t any cleaner.

• He didn’t like how I held a mop and said “Mom didn’t do it that way but I know your parents didn’t teach you” I pretended to learn and then go about it my way when he’s not home.

He’s never been mean about it but I can tell him these things bother him more than they do me. I would rather have a clean home overall and dinner done before 9pm than hyper focusing to make sure every dish is perfectly spotless while the floor stays dirty and counters cluttered. We are usually late to everything because of this behavior. I have started getting anxious if the cleaning isn’t done before he gets home because I know if he’s sees me cleaning he will try to criticize how I’m holding the mop, how much soap is in the bucket, which brushes I’m using to clean the dishes, or how there’s a coffee stain on one of our cleaning rags and it needs to be bleached. I also acknowledge if this is an OCD thing there’s not much I can do about it. My SIL shares the same perspective as me and my husband’s brother has similar tendencies so I totally believe it’s how they were brought up. He’s not the type of man that insists dinner be on the table the moment he walk in or that every room be spotless, so part of me things I should just dedicate all my time to the areas he worries about most and forget the rest?",8,1770391627.0,Mommit,24,0.83,False

My midwife told me that if I feel miserable or hungry then I’m not doing it right but I feel both of those things and as far as I’m aware I’m doing everything as right as I can be.

I still don’t really understand it all. Yesterday my fasting sugars were perfect, this morning they were sky high, so I had the same breakfast as I had yesterday as my numbers were fine after that too, but this morning they were sky high. I don’t understand how to snack or how to make sure my snacks aren’t causing spikes because I’m only meant to check my fasting sugars and then one hour after each meal. I am desperate for just my normal coffee once a day (vanilla latte) but my midwife told me that sweeteners can cause spikes just like sugar and the same goes for sugar free syrups. But then I read online that they are fine so I don’t know.

I usually already eat a pretty limited diet which is my safe/ comfort diet largely due to me being neurodivergent and a lot of the stuff on the GD diet is a sensory nightmare for me and just so far out of my usual routine. I tried to reach out for support from my family but found their responses were more like lectures than support, my MIL gave me a whole essay on what I need to do to to be ‘good’ saying she understands it all because FIL is a type 2 diabetic, but half of the stuff she said was totally contradictory to everything I have learned.

I just want to grab an apple or a pot of mango from the shops without ‘pairing’ it with something that makes me feel sick because it’s too much food for a snack. I want to have a biscuit with my tea. This whole pregnancy has been a shit show and I was only just enjoying food again anyway after 28 weeks of throwing up with HG - I’m still nauseas all day. I have been non stop ill and am on my sixth viral illness right now which is also making eating feel impossible. It’s just such a huge mental load on top of being heavily pregnant, working and parenting my toddler too.

I’m so sorry this is such a woe is me post. I honestly don’t have many friends and the ones I do have are too far away to be able to just spend some time with someone else and take my mind off things.

Thought I'd give this a shot because.. well.

I'm a 26 yo guy currently living in Paris, originally from Tunisia. I had one long-term relationship that ended about a year ago.

I'm mostly an introvert. Love chilling in bed with a movie, TV show, or video games with friends. I also love reading. Mostly Sci-Fi books but I tend to vary a little. I do some music production (been slacking lately though) as well. I love science, technology, space, etc. 

For TV shows I like Andor, TBBT, Ted Lasso, and bunch of other varieties.

For games I play TFT, some League, Rocket League, and I got into ACC for sim racing. For offline I just finished E33. I loved Split Fiction and HK. Love Skyrim as well and thinking about trying out Fallout 4.

I do love going out and experiencing things as well. I go to (English) standups pretty frequently. I also go to chess meetups and random event nights in bars (jazz, games, whatever). I do appreciate a good outing. When weather was better, I'd do  picnics and outdoor runs as well.

It's been hard to meet people here nonetheless. I made some friends here and there but nothing tight or permenant.

I'd love to meet someone for coffee or drinks, chat and see if we get along. Just take it slow from there.

I'm 1.90m medium build brown haired and brown eyed guy. I generally keep a light beard

If this sounds like something you'd enjoy, please send me a message and we'll set something up.

I've visited a NASA location.

I hacked my school website (by accident, I swear).

​Low Overhead: It’s a very clean, minimal UI. No heavy apps that drain your laptop battery or bandwidth.
​Price: It was $3.99, which is basically the price of a coffee where I am.

*Goodbye Julie R / Off to be the Martins' mum / But no one's noticed*

Er, is that it? Julie leaves the show this week, but you wouldn't know it. She tells a couple of people she's going to move in with Philip, and then... she's just gone. Forever (well, until 1992). No goodbye scene, she just stops appearing. Even worse, Helen comes home later in the same episode, asks Jim how things went without her and he *doesn't bother to tell her his daughter's leaving home*. It's like she's been erased from time. And even worse even worse, Scott and Lucy are still under the impression she'll be around after Helen moves to the country two days later! People couldn't stop talking about Maria leaving last month, so I don't know how this went so wrong. It feels like we're not even going to hear when she's actually moved out.

Anyway, more importantly: I am here today to set right a huge Neighbours lore misconception! You know how Phil was permanently paralysed in the car crash, and then was magically healed (and also Ian Rawlings) when he returned? Lies. He is indeed in a wheelchair in his final scenes, but it's directly mentioned that he is on the mend and will be walking soon. No one at any point says he's looking at long term health issues, even if that might make Julie chucking her whole life in for him feel more logical. Tell everyone (and yes, I've already scrubbed it from Wikipedia).

Additionally, I've belatedly realised that the YouTube uploads have declined to update the titles in line with the original broadcast, and should have removed Maria way back at episode 126. Considering it doesn't bother to add Terry to proceedings I don't much care, but I'm going to be really annoyed if the same happens with the proper titles sequences from 1986...

Talking of Terry, last week I was so bewildered by her rescue-the-tape nonsense that I didn't even clock it was hidden at Charles' house. And now, the caper continues as it winds up next to Max Ramsay karaoke in the Robinson house deck. Also, we get to hear it, and it clears nothing up! This is really awful stuff.

Also this week: Grandpa Harry comes back, and Margaret Hayward is forgotten even quicker than Julie Robinson. Helen gets engaged off-screen, and somehow doesn't clock how much more keen Douglas is for a joint bank account than the cottage they'd buy from it. Wally thinks 49% is the same as 0%, and Hitler pops by for a quick coffee.",5,1770390723.0,neighbours,0,1.0,False

I'm looking to start a walking club in Warrington. 

Nothing crazy, just a biweekly/monthly meetup targeted at people looking to walk, explore, or just get some fresh air (and hopefully some sun) out there. 

Obviously the walks will be done on days of decent weather, mostly just starting at point A, getting some coffee and then looping around a set theme or structure (say museum, or garden or some easy trail or just some sightseeing). The idea is very much to keep it relaxing and not intense (although if it grows, I wouldn't be opposed to doing small hikes sometimes). 

I want to start it by Spring but just putting it out there if anyone's interested and we can form a group if people are willing.

1qxjxid,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoorMansWallet/comments/1qxjxid/how_to_save_hundreds_each_month_by_cutting_these/,How to save hundreds each month by cutting these budget items.,"Most people think cutting a household budget means giving up everything fun, but that’s rarely true. The biggest wins usually come from fixing a few quiet money leaks that don’t feel dramatic day to day but add up fast over a month. If you focus on the boring stuff instead of lifestyle sacrifices, saving hundreds can happen without feeling like punishment.

One of the fastest ways to free up cash is to audit recurring expenses you’ve mentally tuned out. Subscriptions, memberships, app renewals, cloud storage, streaming services, and “temporary” add-ons tend to stack over time. Many households are paying for multiple services that do the same thing or haven’t been used in months. Spending an hour canceling or downgrading can easily cut $50 to $150 a month, especially if you negotiate internet, phone, or insurance rates at the same time. Providers count on inertia, so simply asking for a better rate often works.

Another big saver is tightening grocery spending without cutting food quality. Planning meals around what you already have, buying store brands, and shopping with a list sounds basic, but the real difference comes from reducing food waste. Tossing expired produce, half-used sauces, and forgotten leftovers is money straight into the trash. Even small changes like freezing leftovers, cooking two or three flexible meals per week, and avoiding impulse trips can drop grocery costs by a couple hundred dollars a month for families.

The last area that quietly drains budgets is convenience spending. Delivery fees, daily coffee runs, ride shares, and last-minute purchases feel small in isolation, but together they’re brutal. This doesn’t mean never ordering food or grabbing coffee, just setting boundaries so convenience is occasional instead of automatic. Cooking at home a few more nights, batching errands, and making coffee most days can easily redirect $200 or more back into your account each month without touching your core lifestyle.

None of these changes are flashy, and that’s the point. You don’t need extreme frugality or complex spreadsheets to save serious money. You just need to notice where your cash is leaking and patch the holes that don’t actually make your life better.",2,1770390107.0,PoorMansWallet,0,1.0,False

I was recruited on a Tuesday.

That’s what stuck with me the most—how mundane it was. No black vans. No dramatic phone call in the dead of night. Just a man in a gray coat sitting across from me at a café near campus, stirring his coffee even though he never drank it.

He knew my work. My dissertation on anomalous isotopic ratios in Precambrian rock formations. My failed grant proposals. The fact that my father died believing Antarctica wasn’t just ice.

He never said the words *CIA*. He didn’t have to. When he slid a manila folder across the table, there was no letterhead—just a red wax seal pressed into the flap, cracked and old-looking, like it didn’t belong in this century.

“You’re being offered a temporary research assignment at McMurdo Station,” he said. “Full clearance. No publications. No questions.”

I asked what I’d be studying.

He smiled, thin and practiced. “You’ll know when you see it.”

Two weeks later, I was on a military transport plane flying south over an endless white nothing, the engines screaming like animals being dragged to slaughter.

 

McMurdo doesn’t feel real when you first arrive. It’s too exposed. Too fragile. A handful of buildings clinging to the edge of a continent that actively wants you dead.

They took my phone. My laptop. Even my notebook. Everything except my mind—which, in hindsight, was the only thing they couldn’t afford to let me keep.

I was escorted underground within hours of landing.

Not metaphorically. Literally underground.

There’s a section beneath McMurdo that doesn’t exist on any map. An elevator hidden behind a false wall in a maintenance corridor. No buttons—just a retinal scan and a long, silent descent that made my ears pop and my stomach twist.

When the doors opened, the air was warmer.

That was the first red flag.

The second was the smell.

Stone dust. Ozone. And something old—like a tomb that had been breathing for a very long time.

 

They showed me the ice first.

A vertical shaft had been drilled miles down, far deeper than any known Antarctic ice core project. Embedded within the ice walls were shapes—too regular to be natural. Angles. Symmetry. Carvings.

Architecture.

“This layer predates known human civilization by at least 50,000 years,” one of the handlers said, reading from a tablet. “Possibly more.”

I laughed. I couldn’t help it. “That’s not possible.”

No one laughed with me.

As we descended further, the ice gave way to exposed stone—black, glassy, and warm to the touch. My instruments went haywire. Magnetic readings spiked and dropped. Radiation levels fluctuated in patterns that looked almost… intentional.

At the bottom, we stepped into a cavern so vast my headlamp couldn’t find the ceiling.

And there it was.

A city.

Not ruins. Not rubble.

A city, preserved beneath the ice like a fly in amber.

Buildings curved instead of rising straight. Streets spiraled inward toward a central structure that pulsed faintly, like a heartbeat. Every surface was etched with symbols that hurt to look at for too long—lines that refused to stay still, angles that suggested depth where there was none.

“This isn’t human,” I whispered.

“No,” the handler said. “But it’s close.”

 

The truth came in fragments.

The civilization had thrived before the last ice age. Advanced beyond us in ways we still don’t understand. They mastered energy, genetics, architecture—things we’re still fumbling toward.

And then something went wrong.

They found it beneath the ice, too. Something older than them. Something that *dreamed*.

The central structure wasn’t a building. It was a containment system.

A prison.

Every civilization that rises eventually digs too deep. Curiosity is a kind of gravity—it pulls you downward whether you want it to or not.

They tried to study it. Harness it. Communicate.

Instead, it learned them.

The city wasn’t destroyed by a natural disaster. It was *shut down*. Sacrificed. Frozen in place by its own creators to keep what lay beneath from waking fully.

And we had drilled straight through the locks.

 

People started disappearing on my third day.

At first, it was subtle. A technician reassigned. A guard rotated out early. But then someone found blood on the walls of the elevator shaft—frozen in thin, branching patterns, like veins.

I began hearing things in my sleep.

A voice that wasn’t a voice. Pressure behind my eyes. Images of impossible skies and oceans beneath ice, of cities collapsing inward like dying stars.

The symbols started making sense.

Not linguistically. Intuitively.

They weren’t writing. They were *instructions*.

The city wasn’t just a prison—it was a blueprint.

A warning.

Or maybe an apology.

 

They woke it up on purpose.

That’s the part that still makes me sick.

The CIA didn’t come here to study history. They came to see if it could be used. A power source. A weapon. A god on a leash.

When the central structure cracked open, the temperature in the cavern dropped instantly. Frost bloomed across the stone like mold.

Something moved in the dark below.

Not a body. Not a shape.

A *presence*.

Every thought I’d ever had about being small, about not mattering, was suddenly confirmed on a cosmic scale. It noticed us the way you notice bacteria—briefly, with mild irritation.

People started screaming. Some collapsed, clutching their heads as blood streamed from their noses, ears, eyes.

Others just… walked forward.

Into the opening.

Smiling.

 

I ran.

I don’t know why it let me go. Maybe it needed witnesses. Maybe it likes stories.

As the elevator carried me upward, the city *shifted*. Buildings folded inward. Symbols burned themselves into my vision. I could feel it rearranging itself, adapting—learning the shape of our world.

By the time I reached the surface, McMurdo was silent.

No alarms. No lights. Just the wind and the snow and the awful certainty that something down there was no longer contained.

I tried to warn them. I really did.

But every email I sent bounced back. Every call failed. And then the dreams started spreading.

I know because people online have begun describing the same symbols. The same cold voice behind their eyes.

It’s using us now.

Our networks. Our satellites. Our minds.

Antarctica isn’t waking up.

It’s *remembering*.

And when it finishes remembering what it was before the ice…

There won’t be anyone left to write about what comes next.

If you’re reading this and you’ve been dreaming of black stone and spiraling cities—

It already knows your name.

And most days, I wish I didn’t either.

I grew up learning how to listen for danger. Not the loud kind—the quiet kind. The kind that sits in a room and waits. The kind that makes adults whisper even when nothing is wrong. The kind that teaches a child to read a mother’s face faster than any book.

New York City. Not the one you know. Jackson Heights wasn’t loud to me. It was tense. Like the air before something breaks.

Seven people in a one-bedroom apartment. Bodies everywhere. No room to be alone. No room to fall apart. Mattresses on the floor. Clothes folded small to save space. I learned early how to make myself smaller too—how to not take up oxygen, how to not ask for things, how to not add weight to lives already bent under too much of it.

My parents worked until they were hollowed out. My mother came home smelling like bleach and exhaustion, hands raw and burning, scrubbing other people’s messes out of homes she could never afford to rest in. My father’s fingers cracked and split from dishwater and heat, standing for hours so other people could eat comfortably. They came home tired in a way that scared me. The kind of tired that doesn’t go away with sleep.

They told me everything was fine.

I knew it wasn’t.

Every knock at the door froze the room. Every official-looking envelope sat unopened like a bomb. I learned words like papers and deportation before I learned how to ride a bike. Fear wasn’t explained to me. It didn’t need to be. It lived with us.

People call neighborhoods like mine “resilient.”

That’s a lie we tell ourselves so we don’t have to admit how much pain we tolerate.

My parents scraped together money they didn’t have—five thousand dollars—for Catholic school. Tips. Overtime. Swallowed pride. Every dollar hurt. Every cent was a silent apology to themselves: I’m sorry we can’t give you more. I felt that money like a weight on my chest. I knew I had to be worth it.

I didn’t dream as a kid. I watched.

I watched other children move through the world like it wouldn’t punish them for existing. I watched parents who weren’t afraid. I watched lives that felt… softer. And something inside me hardened because I knew I didn’t get that version.

The Q33 bus was my escape hatch. I pressed my forehead to the window and imagined a future I couldn’t name—just something farther away than where I was. Some days, the best thing that happened to me was a sandwich from the bodega. I remember begging to use EBT, the owner sighing before saying yes. I remember the relief. I remember the shame. Both at the same time.

They told me I was smart.

I wanted them to tell me we were safe.

Being “gifted” didn’t change anything. It didn’t fix the lights flickering. It didn’t quiet the panic in my mother’s voice. It didn’t make the world kinder to my parents. It just meant I understood early that this life wasn’t fair—and that no one was coming to fix it.

When the Specialized High School test came, I knew what it was without anyone telling me. This wasn’t a test. It was a door. And doors don’t open twice for kids like me.

I studied everywhere. On buses. On the floor. Late at night with the city breathing through the walls. I studied because failing felt like betrayal. Because my parents had already given everything they had. Because I couldn’t afford to waste their sacrifice.

The morning of the test, my father drove me in his old car, the muffler rattling like it might give up. He bought me a small coffee with the last few dollars in his wallet and kissed my forehead.

“Haz lo que tengas que hacer, hijo.”

Do what you have to do.

I walked into that building terrified—not of the exam, but of being seen. Of being exposed as someone who didn’t belong. When the proctor said begin, my hands shook. And then something steadied. I thought of my parents. I thought of that apartment. I thought of the life waiting for me if I failed.

When I got into Brooklyn Tech, I didn’t celebrate. I cried alone. Because relief scared me. Because I knew this wasn’t the end. Because I knew how easy it would be to fall back.

Tech was hard in a way people don’t talk about. Not just the work—the loneliness. The constant feeling that everyone else had a map and I was improvising. I took trains for hours every day and sat in classrooms pretending I wasn’t exhausted. Pretending I wasn’t afraid. Pretending I wasn’t carrying my family on my back.

I chased the hardest classes not out of passion, but out of fear. Fear of being ordinary. Fear of being forgettable. Fear that if I slowed down, the ground would swallow me again. I dropped lunch. I overloaded. I kept going because stopping felt dangerous.

By the time I graduated, I didn’t feel proud.

I felt tired.

Then MIT.

I didn’t apply because I thought I belonged. I applied because something in me needed to know if the ceiling was real. Because if I was going to hit it, I wanted to hear the sound it made.

December, 2022.

6:28 p.m.

I locked myself in the apartment. My hands shook so badly I thought I might throw up. I was already preparing myself to be disappointed—to tell my parents it was okay, that we tried, that life would go on.

Then I saw “Congratulations.”

I didn’t scream. I didn’t smile. My body went numb. Like everything I’d been holding back finally crashed into me all at once. My mother cried—not loudly, not dramatically. Just quietly. Like she was letting go of something she’d been carrying for years.

That was the moment I realized how heavy my childhood had been.

1qxjqx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qxjqx4/every_time_you_get_paid_do_this_kevin_olearys/,"Every Time You Get Paid, Do THIS: Kevin O'Leary's Science-Backed Wealth Trick ($0 Required)","I used to think building wealth meant grinding harder. Working overtime, side hustles, sacrificing sleep. Then I stumbled across Kevin O'Leary's payment day strategy while researching wealth psychology from investors, behavioral economists, and personal finance experts. It completely flipped how I approach money. The wild part? Most people never learn this because our education system teaches us jack shit about financial literacy. We're conditioned to earn and spend, not earn and multiply. But here's the thing: you can change that pattern with one simple habit the moment your paycheck hits.

# 1. Pay yourself first (but not how you think)

The second money hits your account, move 10-20% into a separate savings or investment account. Not at the end of the month. Not after bills. Immediately.

O'Leary calls this ""paying Mr. Wonderful"" and honestly, it's the most unglamorous wealth building hack that actually works. Most people pay everyone else first (landlord, Netflix, student loans) then ""save what's left."" Spoiler: there's never anything left.

The psychology behind this is simple. When money disappears before you can mentally spend it, you adjust your lifestyle around what remains. Your brain doesn't miss what it never ""had.""

Set up automatic transfers for the same day as payday. Treat it like a non-negotiable bill. Within 6 months you'll have built a financial cushion without feeling the pinch. Within 5 years? You've got serious capital.

**Book rec**: *The Wealthy Barber* by David Chilton. This book sold over 2 million copies and basically broke down exactly how ordinary people build extraordinary wealth through this one principle. Chilton makes finance feel like you're chatting with a smart friend over coffee, not sitting through an economics lecture. The ""pay yourself first"" framework he presents will genuinely rewire how you see money. Best personal finance book I've read, hands down.

# 2. Make your money work harder than you do

O'Leary is obsessed with cash flow. Every dollar should generate more dollars. Once you've saved a decent amount, start investing it. Index funds, dividend stocks, REITs, whatever matches your risk tolerance.

The goal isn't to become a day trader. It's to create passive income streams that compound over time. Even $100/month invested with 8% average returns becomes $150k in 30 years. That's the power of compound interest that Einstein supposedly called the eighth wonder of the world.

Start small. Most investing apps now have zero minimums. Wealthfront, Betterment, or even Robinhood for beginners. Just start. The biggest mistake isn't picking the wrong investment, it's never investing at all.

**App rec**: Acorns. This app rounds up your purchases to the nearest dollar and invests the spare change automatically. Sounds gimmicky but it's insanely effective for people who struggle with investing discipline. You're essentially investing without thinking about it. Before you know it, you've got a few thousand dollars working for you.

# 3. Track every single dollar (yes, every one)

O'Leary tracks his spending obsessively. Not because he's cheap, but because awareness creates control. Most people have zero clue where their money actually goes. They just know they're always broke.

Spend one month tracking everything. Coffee, subscriptions, impulse Amazon purchases, everything. You'll be shocked at how much leaks out on stuff you don't even value.

Then cut the fat. Not the things you genuinely love, but the mindless spending that adds zero happiness to your life. Redirect that money into investments or debt payoff.

**App rec**: YNAB (You Need A Budget). This isn't just expense tracking, it's a whole philosophy around giving every dollar a job. The interface takes a minute to learn but once you do, it's genuinely life changing. Users report saving an average of $600 in their first two months. The app costs money but pays for itself immediately.

# 4. Build multiple income streams early

O'Leary didn't get wealthy from one source. He had businesses, investments, royalties, and TV income. The average millionaire has 7 income streams.

You don't need to start 7 businesses tomorrow, but think beyond your day job. Freelance skills, rental income, dividend stocks, online courses, whatever. The goal is to create redundancy so you're never dependent on a single income source.

This also gives you negotiation power at work. When you're not desperate for the paycheck, you can make career moves from a position of strength not fear.

Start with one additional stream. Even an extra $500/month completely changes your financial trajectory over a decade.

**Resource rec**: *The Millionaire Fastlane* by MJ DeMarco. DeMarco tears apart the ""get rich slow"" mentality and argues for building scalable businesses and income streams. It's controversial, kinda aggressive, but insanely good if you're tired of the traditional financial advice that keeps you mediocre. The book won't tell you to clip coupons. It'll tell you to think bigger and build assets that actually scale.

# 5. Eliminate bad debt aggressively

O'Leary hates bad debt (credit cards, car loans, anything that doesn't generate income). Good debt builds wealth (mortgages, business loans). Bad debt destroys it.

If you're carrying credit card balances, attack them with everything you've got. The interest rates are predatory, often 18-25%. No investment will reliably beat that, so paying off high interest debt IS your best investment.

Use the avalanche method: pay minimums on everything except the highest interest debt, then demolish that one. Once it's gone, roll that payment into the next highest. Momentum builds fast.

The mental freedom from being debt free is worth more than the math suggests. You sleep better. You stress less. You make better decisions.

# 6. Invest in skills that pay forever

O'Leary constantly emphasizes that your earning ability is your greatest asset. The more valuable your skills, the more you can charge.

Invest in courses, certifications, coaching, books, anything that increases your market value. A $2,000 course that helps you negotiate a $10,000 raise is a 5x return in year one alone.

Focus on high income skills: sales, copywriting, coding, project management, data analysis. Skills the market actually rewards, not just stuff that sounds interesting.

Your income potential isn't fixed. It's a skill you can develop like any other. Treat your career like a business and yourself as the product.

**Platform rec**: Coursera or Udemy for affordable skill building. Coursera partners with actual universities (Stanford, Yale, Google) so you're getting legit education for a fraction of the cost. Courses on financial modeling and negotiation can directly increase income. Udemy is hit or miss quality wise but during sales you can grab courses for like $15 that are genuinely valuable.

Another tool worth checking out is BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app developed by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers. Type in any skill or goal, like becoming better at negotiation or understanding investment psychology, and it generates personalized audio podcasts pulled from books, research papers, and expert interviews. You control the depth, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. What makes it different is the adaptive learning plan it builds around your specific goals and struggles, kind of like having a structured roadmap that evolves as you progress. There's also a virtual coach you can chat with for recommendations or clarifications while listening. Makes fitting learning into commutes or workouts way easier.

The system isn't designed to make you wealthy. It's designed to keep you comfortable enough to keep working but never comfortable enough to stop. O'Leary's approach isn't revolutionary, it's just disciplined. Pay yourself first, invest consistently, track ruthlessly, diversify income, kill bad debt, and never stop learning. These aren't secrets, they're just actions most people refuse to take because they require short term sacrifice for long term gain. But if you implement even half of these strategies, you'll be in the top 10% financially within a decade. Not because you worked harder, but because you worked smarter with what you already have.",2,1770389695.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

I have been working on it through my last two pregnancies because I’m high risk and have to see lots of doctors. Now I’m pregnant again and it was time to see a dentist after almost 20 years. 

So my appointment was at 7:30 (they are booking a year out and if you cancel an appointment you get put on the bad patient list). I wake my exhausted pregnant ass up at 6am, shower, get dressed, do a bunch of breathing and psyching myself up, and go say goodbye to my husband so I am out the door at 7. 

My kids (4 and 2) wake up between 6:30 - 7:15 every day. Every. Single. Day. So I assume they’ll be waking up as I leave, my husband knows the morning routine so i’ll go the dentist and when i get home everything is handled because that’s what a good partner would do, right?

On the way to the dentist the gas light turns on, I’m a little pissed but can’t be that mad because I don’t put gas in the car unless the light turns on. I get to the dentist and turns out they need a release because I’m pregnant, so I call the OB and get one sent and everything is delayed, whatever no big deal my husband can handle the kids. 

I go back and get x rays, teeth cleaned, lectured about not going to the dentist and told everything wrong and how it’s going to take a long time to fix it all. I’m shaking the whole time, at the end of the appointment I cried and the hygienist had to comfort me, it was a mess. 

I leave, get gas, get myself a coffee as a reward and take a longer drive home to calm down. I walk into the house and it’s silent. It’s now 9:15am, how are the kids still sleeping?

I run upstairs and they aren’t sleeping. They are literally laying in my bed playing together while my husband is still sleeping in the other bed. These kids CHOSE NOT TO WAKE HIM UP. 

My 4 year old then says “mommy is it christmas?” because the only reason he can think of that I would not be there when he woke up is if it’s Christmas and I’m downstairs making cinnamon rolls and coffee before letting the kids down. 

Nope buddy it’s not Christmas. “oh then why were you downstairs so long?” 

I was at the doctor, daddy was supposed to get up with you. “Oh. Yeah me and (brother) let daddy sleep.”

These kids NEVER “let me sleep”. Now I’m making them waffles and changing diapers and doing all the stuff that was supposed to be handled already. I can’t even be upset because he was ready and willing to handle it all, he does regularly so I can have an extra few hours of sleep or alone time, but I’m so frustrated that I thought I could not worry and not have to do it all and end up doing it anyway.

1qxjnj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/radicalmentalhealth/comments/1qxjnj4/fear_of_concerta/,Fear of Concerta,"I (28f) was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and depression about 3 years ago. I tried all sorts of antidepressants, benzos and finally I though I found the right treatment: Zoloft (now on 200mg), a benzo to help me chill when needed.

However, after finding a new therapist (the best one for me), three minutes into the first hour she says ""it sounds like you have adhd, not depression"" and gives me the number of the psychiatrist she trusted with her daughter, who had a similar problem.

My doctor prescribed me Concerta 18mg and said I should keep going with the Zoloft as well. He also said I can double up the dosage after a week if I feel like nothing changed.

Yesterday, I took it for the first time at 2pm. My addictive tendencies led me to take another one at around 7pm, along with a Rivotril. I also drank three coffees because I had a very long and busy day. When I felt like going to sleep at around 2am, I had a massive panic attack, with shivering, muscle pain and an inability to sit still in the bed. It was bad, but half a benzo calmed me down.

It was very stupid of me, I know.

This morning, I took my regular Zoloft and another Concerta. I am worried if I combine the wrong stuff, I'll get another one. Now, I feel a bit dazed but focused enough to write this long post.

In your experience, what drugs (legal or illegal) didn't mix at all with Concerta? I must say I am a regular weed smoker and I sometimes drink (btw I know that when I used to take the old illegal stimulant amphetamine up my nose, I REALLY needed to drink).

What do you recommend for someone like me, who has had a problem with drug abuse for ten years now? What are your experiences with this medication? ",3,1770389476.0,radicalmentalhealth,0,1.0,False

I think I can really do this now and not feel like Im intruding or being fake.

Does that even make since? I want to know how to suck a mans cock and please him while I receive pleasure doing it.

for context : she is in college and i am dropper, and we were out of contact for 6-7 years before this, also i did liked her from start but i figured this out around class 3 and our dynamic before 6-7 years was very good but after that i won't say it as positive, i think i hurt her so that's why i distanced myself and i was shy, very shy

so fast forward, i confessed to her from an anonymous acc. on ig with a long para summing all years from class 1 to class 10, and tbh i just sent this with confirm rejection or something like that but i won't say ki i was not hoping that this somehow works out

she saw the message we exchanged few texts but due to anonymous acc she left on unseen and i messaged her from main after a week, we talked but i never mentioned love, like, crush or anything like that, had few chats and after a week i out of no where asked her out, like didn't mention date or like that just would she like to go out, she declined but liked to have a call (first time talking on call), had normal talk about college, current things etc but nothing on going out or about confession, after the call her message popped out that she would like to try, which meant to see how things goes, i thought she agreed to meet me but yeah, we did meet next day

had conversation although it was one sided from her, i was stiff and well seeing her after years , gave her a kagaaz ke phool, and chocolate and had coffee, this was not long...an hour around, from then had normal chats about here and there, and by one chat session it seemed she was comfortable here like she was willing to, but i didn't asked anything like that it would have been pressuring, then her college holiday got over and text became fewer, she was busy with classes and programs etc.

i will mention this that before confession i had seen these as i know her somewhat i would say, like she had always been acad topper, program participant etc. like you know focused and goal oriented so, this was not that suprising her being busy etc. but yeah i did feel a little distanced but this was on me, i have time not her, still things were good i don't know about her what she thought ya what she felt, but somewhere along the line a few days back i just felt ki kuch heavy aane wala hai, matlab things will clear up and i also thought to ask her ki what she want as her and mine situation are totally opposite

and i got her message, she was little hesistant, but then said it out, her message was a little confusing but i got the answer that shie is not ready now but i can't figure out ki feels right now, matlab shi like me or not, she has reasons for not now and i will its admirable

"""" and for the answer to need is ki i will be waiting, waiting in sense ki grinding towards my thing and then maybe after college etc. i will see if i should ask her out and thinking this way bcz by how she sounded it was like she has some responsibilities, which i totally get, so i thought to just wait, in 3-4 years i will get to know if i should pursue her or not, bcz thing is i love her more, more than how her image was in my brain, she is imperfectly perfect and i would certainly not want to lose someone like her, but if her feelings are different, she is what i would call beauty with brain, also i will gladly move on, but just if.. , """"

tl:dr - i wanna wait for correct time and see how things goes, bcz i haven't heard her say no ya not like, and i think she just has a lot on her plate right now, also we are on good terms now like platonic and i don't intent to say anything now

The changes I’ve noticed are clear. My skin is clearer. I used to struggle with keeping it clear, but now it’s much better. I sleep better and deeper. My teeth are whiter. I brush them the same as before, but they just stay clean. I feel less stressed. My appetite is more natural, and my digestive system is calmer.

Mornings aren’t a struggle anymore. Before, without coffee, I basically woke up like a zombie, totally out of it and barely functioning. Now I splash some water on my face, wait a few minutes, and I’m awake. I don’t need anything external to get going.

My focus has improved. I’m calmer and steadier, able to concentrate on one thing at a time without feeling rushed or scattered.

One thing I hadn’t realized until now is how much mental energy I used to spend thinking about coffee. Whenever I was out with friends or family, part of me was always wondering where the next cup was coming from. That’s completely gone now. Even though it’s a small change, it makes a difference. I notice the day and the moments more consciously.

Maybe the most important thing is the confidence I’ve gained in my own body. I know now that I can wake up, think, and function without relying on an outside substance.

Since quitting coffee, I feel more stable, alert, calm, and free, and overall just better in my day-to-day life.



  


I’m curious, how about you?

Has anyone else quit coffee and noticed real differences?

1qxjl4z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qxjl4z,Update: Hard water? Metal? in [Breville Barista Express],"Ok, so from my post yesterday I did a bit more looking into things and I still don't have any answers but here's some more photos for discussion. 

TL/DR; I think my issue is dissolved solids in my water, not an issue with the machine or QA (despite what was the thoughts of the majority on my first post).

To those that asked: 

* the metallic-looking solids crumbled easily in my fingers (first photo from yesterday)
* I couldn't get them all to dissolve in vinegar after several hours

This morning:

I ran descale cycles on my Breville for about 30 minutes repetitively, on the One-Cup, Water, and Nozzle wand (with and without the tip installed).

I collected all the fines and filtered them in a V60 filter.

Opened up and photographed.

I clearly wasn't diligent in cleaning the brew head of coffee grinds because most of what ended on the filter paper was espresso grinds.

Knowing that this is:

1. A 5 year old machine
2. That the town water I'm on is hard
3. I only descale 2-3 times per year

I think this is an issue of dissolved solids and I'm going to be more diligent descaling in future.

For this super-interested, my town's recent water report shows these minerals:

* Calcium 73.9 mg/L
* Total dissolved solids 438 mg/L
* Aluminum 0.004 mg/L
* Sodium 43.2 mg/L
* and way more things that I wish weren't in my water

I feel like I'm much more strongly considering one of those reverse osmosis filters under my sink now.  Never really thought there was much point before this little experiment.

1qxjkgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/1qxjkgj/entitled_dad_decided_my_class_was_a_public/,"Entitled dad decided my class was a public playground because his kid was ""bored""","I help teach a Saturday morning intro art class at our local community centre. It’s very low key, mostly adults and a couple teens, everyone paid their fee and we just mess around with charcoal, still life setups, basic stuff. The building has a big lobby and a hallway that leads to a few rooms, and there’s a sign that says ""Classes in session, please do not enter."" Last weekend we were about 40 minutes into a session and the door opens and a little boy, maybe 6, just wanders in like he owns the place. He immediately goes for our tables and starts poking at people’s supplies, dragging his fingers through a tray of charcoal dust and giggling. I told him, nicely, hey bud, you can’t be in here, where’s your grown up? He shrugs and says ""Dad’s out there."" I walk him back to the hallway and there’s a man leaning against the wall on his phone like he’s waiting for a coffee, not a child. I said, hi, your son came into our room, can you keep him with you? The dad barely looks up and goes ""Yeah he just needs to burn off energy, it’s fine."" I told him no, it’s not fine, we have materials all over and people are working. He gives me this annoyed sigh and says ""It’s a community centre, you can’t expect silence."" I wasn’t asking for silence, I was asking for him to not treat my classroom like a soft play area.



I thought that was it, but about ten minutes later the kid comes back in, this time with a juice box, and he starts swinging it around like a weapon. He bumps a student’s water cup and it spills all over her sketchbook. She says ""hey!"" and he laughs and runs behind our still life stand. When I went out again, the dad said ""If you guys had something for kids, this wouldn’t be a problem."" I told him we do have things for kids, in the kids programs, not in the middle of an adults class he did not sign up for. He snapped back with ""Well I pay taxes, so yeah, you kind of work for us."" At that point I stopped trying to be polite. I told him either he keeps his son with him in the lobby or they both need to leave. He tried to argue that his wife was ""in a meeting"" and he didn’t have anywhere else to go for an hour. I said that’s unfortunate, but it’s not my job to provide childcare and I’m not risking someone getting hurt or having their work ruined. He did the classic loud voice thing, saying I was being hostile to a child. A front desk staff member came over because he was causing a scene, and the dad immediately switched to ""She’s refusing to let my son participate."" Staff asked if he was enrolled. He wasn’t. They asked him to step outside, and he left muttering about how people hate families now. The class was so quiet after, like everyone was holding their breath, and then one woman just goes ""I’m glad you didn’t cave."" I still feel shaky about it though. Did I handle it right or should I have tried harder to keep the peace?

"""" and for the answer to need is ki i will be waiting, waiting in sense ki grinding towards my thing and then maybe after college etc. i will see if i should ask her out and thinking this way bcz by how she sounded it was like she has some responsibilities, which i totally get, so i thought to just wait, in 3-4 years i will get to know if i should pursue her or not, bcz thing is i love her more, more than how her image was in my brain, she is imperfectly perfect and i would certainly not want to lose someone like her, but if her feelings are different, she is what i would call beauty with brain, also i will gladly move on, but just if.. , """"

tl:dr - i wanna wait for correct time and see how things goes, bcz i haven't heard her say no ya not like, and i think she just has a lot on her plate right now, also we are on good terms now like platonic and i don't intent to say anything now

I’m not sure if this is appropriate to post here, but I’m based in Toronto and have progressive views. I was wondering if there are any like-minded folks in or around Toronto who might be interested in meeting up. We could do something low-key like coffee, lunch, or another activity. The idea is simply to connect with people who share similar values.",6,1770388985.0,progressive_islam,0,0.88,False

Can someone shed some light on my situation ?,"I always start the day with about 20 ounces of water and a cup of coffee. ( no food until noon). About a half hour after my hydration and cup of my favorite beverage I went to yoga. Halfway through I felt so nauseous I was panicking and looking how to get out of there fast. Well, the feeling went away but now I’m worried. What’s the least amount of water (I’ll skip the coffee til class is over) can I drink do that my insides won’t think there’s food in there and make me feel sick? I really believe water is the best way to start the day but I don’t know how much is too much. Thank you for any insight you can give.",3,1770388897.0,YogaWorkouts,2,1.0,False
