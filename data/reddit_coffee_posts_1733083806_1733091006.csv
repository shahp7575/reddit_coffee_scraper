I've been scoped everywhich way and gotten MRI's and nothing. I mostly get lower abdominal pain, the only think they could find is gallstones, but my pain isn't totally consistent with gallstones.

  
When I have onions, or garlic, it's hard to tell if I'm reacting to it. The only thing that's clear is that after a lot of alcohol or coffee, I feel it the next day. I did a run of low fodmap and no alochol and coffee with little improvement. When I did a streak of simple clean eating, that wasn't low fodmap things got back to normal, but the minute I had alcohol the pain came the next day. Also I just get mild pain, everyone else's reactions seem to be clear. On the whole, I find that it's really hard to parse this stuff out.

What are your reactions like? How quickly do they happen? And how consistent is it? Like is it everytime you have garlic? or if you have garlic a few days in a row the reaction tends to happen? 

To me there's very little clear signal and just a murky pain. Anyone else in a similar boat and figured it out? What did you do?",1,1733090287.0,FODMAPS,0,1.0,False

Here's some context. 

Lost my job 02/24 then exhausted my unemployment benefits waiting to be dispatched from the union again. I also own a coffee shop which I had to relocate and remodel the new building before reopening and spent everything I had saved. I then started a small construction company early this fall and was very optimistic with the amount of leads/work I had lined up until one by one customers postponed jobs until spring. 

Coffee shop grosses approx $12k/mo w/ $2500-3000 profit

Construction company grossed $4500/ last mo w/$3k profit (7/10 jobs fell thru)

House hold bills $5500/mo

Home value $593k and owe $342k. 

Retirement account $113k. 

Here's the kicker, I don't have great credit from medical bills a few years ago and I was in the middle of remodeling my house when I lost my job.

Ideally I would like to get a heloc to pay my mortgage payments until March when work picks up again and I get my taxes back then leave it alone. 

Or I'm looking at taking $50k out of retirement and paying 30% taxes plus that will show up as income and potentially screw me during tax season. ",1,1733090200.0,personalfinance,1,1.0,False

1h4el6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1h4el6l/sons_of_steel_1/,Sons of Steel - #1,"Level 23 of Sector 7 awoke as it always did: amidst the steam of makeshift kitchens and the relentless murmur of thousands of lives crammed into tiny spaces. Sara navigated the elevated walkways, dodging clotheslines and perpetually dripping ducts, while the rusted metal groaned under her feet.

Tomorrow, she would leave. The thought floated in her mind like a constant murmur she couldn’t silence. She looked around, trying to imprint every detail in her memory: the way the light filtered through the metal structures, the smell of boiled food mixed with dampness, the sounds of conversations that now felt unnervingly vivid. What if she never saw this again? The question cut through her like a blade.

Was this nostalgia? The word felt strange, almost irritating. She, who had always hated this place, who had dreamed of leaving, who had seen every corner as a prison, now felt something akin to a dull ache. It wasn’t sadness—it was something more indefinable. As if, suddenly, the place she had always wanted to escape from became significant simply because she wouldn’t be there anymore.

She paused at an intersection. A group of children played on one of the small platforms between the towers, chasing each other around cables and pipes. A woman hung clothes on a line strung between two structures. An old man dozed off, sitting in a corner. Everything seemed so normal, so mundane.

The apartments were stacked on top of each other like worn metal boxes. Most weren’t larger than a bed, yet entire families lived in them. The walls were so thin that at night you could hear the breathing, the arguments, the crying of neighbors. It was like living in a hive of concrete and metal where privacy was an unattainable luxury.

Propaganda screens, old and stained but still functional, were embedded between exposed pipes. “Your duty is to serve. Your honor is to fight.” The message repeated at every corner, every intersection, like an endless echo.

“Hey, Sara!” Mira’s voice barely rose above the market’s din. She was in her usual spot, a nook between two buildings barely bigger than a cupboard. Her face lit up as she sorted through scrap in her hands. “Where have you been? It’s been days since you came by.”

“I’ve been busy, you know me—I never stay still,” Sara joked, sidestepping a pile of broken screens threatening to collapse.

Mira grinned as she rummaged behind her makeshift counter, built from welded metal plates.

“Have you had breakfast? I managed to get some real coffee. Well, almost real,” her eyes twinkled mischievously. “I got it in a trade with that merchant from Level 26—the one with the horrible green jacket. You know, the one who never seems to blink.”

Sara moved closer as Mira dug through her belongings, pulling out a battered little teapot. The aroma that emerged as she opened it was familiar: a mix of roasted beans and something else. The scent filled the small space as Mira poured the dark liquid into two mismatched cups, steam rising in spirals.

“So, what brings you here so early?” Mira asked, handing her a cup.

Sara held the warm drink in her hands, grateful for the heat. For a moment, she stared at the dark liquid, searching for the right words. She took a small sip, buying herself time. The taste was bitter and slightly metallic, but better than the usual imitations.

“Do I need a reason to visit my best friend?” She tried to sound casual, but something in the way Mira narrowed her eyes told her she wasn’t fooled.

Mira sighed.

“I guess it’s true, then,” she murmured, her smile fading. “You’re leaving tomorrow, aren’t you?”

Sara nodded, leaning against the rusty railing. From there, the city stretched in every direction—a vertical maze of towers and hanging bridges lost in perpetual haze. Somewhere far above were the upper levels. Down here, the sun was little more than a blurred stain barely breaking through the tangle of walkways and buildings.

“I thought it was just rumors,” Mira said, sifting through her wares without really organizing them. “You know how people are down here, always gossiping. Like when they claimed to have seen a real tree on Level 19.”

Her attempt to keep the conversation light only made everything harder.

“One week,” she finally muttered, dropping a pile of ration cards. “How do they expect to turn someone into a soldier in one week? It’s madness, Sara.”

“They don’t have a choice,” Sara replied, watching the steady flow of people below them. “The exclusion zones expand every month. They need more soldiers.”

“They always need more soldiers,” Mira spat bitterly. “What about what we need? What about what you need?”

A group of children ran by, their laughter echoing off the metal. They wore bracelets made of scrap, pretending to be soldiers. The propaganda worked—even here, where sunlight barely reached, the youngest dreamed of uniforms and medals.

“You know you can stay,” Mira whispered, stepping closer. Her voice carried a pleading tone Sara had never heard before. “There’s work in the lower levels—it’s not like it used to be. The Triads are keeping order there. You could even work with me here at the stall. Together, we could—”

“Keep sinking?” Sara interrupted. The coffee in her cup was already cold. “Wait until the exclusion zones reach us here? At least this way…”

“At least this way, you’ll die in a uniform—is that it?” Mira’s gray eyes shone with something between anger and fear. “Is that what you want?”

The silence that followed was heavy. Somewhere nearby, a pipe dripped in a monotonous rhythm.

Sara looked at her, trying to memorize her face: the scar cutting across her left cheek, the gray eyes that always found the silver lining in everything. Tomorrow, when she was at the training barracks, this moment would be just another memory.

“I can’t,” she finally said, her fingers playing with the recruitment card in her pocket. “I can’t keep sinking, Mira. At least this way, I can try to rise.”

He was saying gross and racist words like ""You never understand what is asked, get back to your country"" whereas the barista have had already made a second drink for the client.

The barista, tired of being yelled at, threw coffee at the client's face and told to get to his manager if he was unsatisfied.

you might want to make your coffee and eat your breakfast while reading this kasi medyo mahaba to.

so it started after nesting namin nung napunta ako sa team nila. kami yung batch na sinabi ng ibang team lead na wala daw tapon kasi lahat daw competitive sa performance pero sinabi nung isa kong kateam na kaya lang daw mataas score sa kpi namin kasi nasa madali daw kami na queue (bpo terms). inignore ko yun and tumawa na lang kasi ayoko ng issue and baka tama naman sila. syempre bago lang kami. what if bumagsak kami if pag tagal or nasa mahirap na queue na. fast forward, naging close ko yung QA sa team namin and nagkaayana maginom. inaya niya din buong team namin except sa team lead namin kasi nalaman kong di pala nila gusto yun. yung place ng inom namin is sa place ko and dun nila nilabas lahat ng attacks nila towards sa TL namin that time. face shame, body shame pati pag sabi ko na mabait naman yung TL namin (kasi legit mabait naman talaga) binigyan malisya kesyo kaya daw mabait kasi gusto ako. trying so hard to fit in sa group, nakikitawa na din ako sa lahat ng kwento nila about dun sa TL namin. at dahil siguro kasi magkakasundo na yung team namin sa pagbabash sa kanya, tumapang yung iba to the point na pati sa office pinaparinggan nila kahit nasa likod lang namin. pati panglalait sa mga workmates namin sa ibang team na dadaan lang naging hobby na nila. i felt uncomfortable that time kasi parang unethical na yung mga actions.

after nung quarter na yun, nag resign yung TL namin kasi may kateam kaming nahuli for work misconduct na nag resign. so ang blame sa TL napunta. di na pala kasi first time yun, yung buong team pala na yun is binabantay na ng officers kasi sila yung nahuli for work misconduct before pa kami napunta sa kanila, pinagbigyan lang.

then napunta kami sa bagong TL at bagong QA sa quarter shuffle. mga bago na din mga officers namin dun pati Team Manager. natuwa pako nun kasi mukha namang cool yung TL at QA namin so akala ko okay na din sa kanila.

mas naging worse pala yung team namin.

nag higpit yung bagong TM namin kasi alam nila yung work misconduct na nangyari which is understandable naman. and after one month, nahuli na nga ang team namin dahil nag zozoom kami sa office na kami kami lang which is bawal talaga. dun nako naguilty kasi ayoko din talaga mawalan ng work and mabait yung bagong TL namin. lahat ng kpi na sinet niya sa team eh sinusunod ko kasi ayoko talaga na nacacall out sa trabaho at medyo competitive ako sa kpi target. 

sa gc namin, mula nung pinapasunod na samin yung standard talaga ng kpi (petiks kasi sila dati), lalo silang nag rage. lahat ng officers dinedegrade nila sa gc namin na kesyo mabaho daw, bobo daw, amoy tae daw, baboy daw at lahat na. and ginagawa ulit nila yung pagpaparinig dun sa office mismo na andun yung officers. tas yung dalawang kasama sa gc na yun eh yung dalawang QA sa ibang team na tinotolerate yung kagagaguhan nila. kaya siguro mas lumakas loob nila. kasi pag may cluster meeting nalalaman din namin mga sinabi dun sa meeting kumbaga may info na din kami pati if sinusumbong ba kami or hindi. nung una nakikisabay pako pa-haha haha lang sa gc pero nung nag new quarter na, napagod nako mag interact pag ganun yung topic. nakakadrain pala pag puro bash at hate yung topic ng mga taong kasama mo, to the point na di na din ako nun sumasali sa zoom nila (hybrid set up pala kami). nagtaka na sila nun sakin kasi bigla na daw ako di sumasali eh active ako makinig dati, around july to, ang palusot ko na lang eh hirap ako mag habol sa kpi namin habang sabay sabay sila magsalita sa zoom di ako makapag focus ganun. tas okay naman sa kanila kasi pag RTO kami sa kanila pa din naman ako sumasama.

and one time dumalaw sa station ko yung PWD naming kabatch, nakipag usap lang kasi magkaiba kami ng shift eh. tas pagkaalis nun, nagulat ako kasi yung kateam kong katabi ko biglang sabi “huy bat kayo tumatawa” tas di ko alam context. nalaman ko na lang nung nag chat yung pwd kong kawork sakin na pinagtawanan daw ata siya ng kateam ko and dun ko naconnect. di ko kasi napansin kasi sa kanya ako nakaharap and nasa likod ko yung mga kateam ko. di ko naman inisip na gagawin nila yun knowing na kaclose ko yung pwd and alam naman nila yun. so galit ako nun pero di ako umimik. shinare ko yun sa kabatch kong nasa kabilang team at napamura din siya kasi ang lala na daw ng mga kateam ko at pati pwd. nakamove on naman ang lahat after nun.

around august totally nadedetach na talaga ako sa kanila kasi inaraw araw nila yung panglalait sa kung sino na lang matripan nila. parang inugali na. kada may meeting sa buong cluster, pati mga QA na di naman nila kilala may sinasabi din sila. nakakadrain. ako lagi yung nagsasabi sa kanila na okay naman yung taong tinitira nila kasi nakausap ko na or nakasama and bigyan nila ng chance. andun na talaga ako sa point na ayokong ma-associate sa mga skwater nilang paguugali.

last week ng august nalaman kong may isa silang gc na di pala ako kasama. lahat ng bago sa team andun except sakin at sa isang kateam namin na di din nila bet. nung nag back read din ako ng videos kasi may hinahanap ako, nakita kong may video pala dun yung PWD kong friend at pinagtawanan nila dun, tinawag pang “stephen king” daw. yun na yung cue ko to bail. nag leave ako sa gc and nag deactivate ng facebook. tinanggal ko din sila sa followers and following ko sa instagram. as in total shut down kasi pati sa RTO namin, sa ibang bay ako nakaupo. siningil ko utang nila sakin thru sa isa naming kateam na di ko close kasi ayoko talaga sila makainteract and nag request akong malipat ng shift and ready nako nun mag resign kasi if ganung environment lang din makakasalamuha ko everyday, baka maubos lang ako.

nalascreenshot yung pang momock nila sa PWD kong friend na yun and kineep namin yun ng isa pang kawave namin na pinagsabihan ko about dun. until di na niya kinaya and sinend niya dun sa PWD and dun na nag escalate lahat. sinend nung PWD kong kawave sa TL niya and umabot sa TM ng cluster nila and nag pa-HR sila after two days. galit na galit daw yung TL ng kawave ko na yun.

di ko inexpect yun. nung una natakot pako kasi nga may pinagsamahan din kami ng kateam ko. kahit papano eh naging close ko sila. until nalaman ko na after ko pala mag leave sa gc, eh ako naman ginawa nilang pulutan. lol totoo nga sinasabi nila, na lalabas daw animosity ng isang tao sayo the moment na may onting misunderstanding kayo. di pa alam ng team ko yung HR kasi ang sabi mahabang process pa daw yun. yung TM nung kawave ko, kinausap yung TM ko (magkaiba kami ng cluster) about dun sa issue at nagalit sila kasi PWD friendly yung office namin, so di sila makapaniwala na may maggaganun sa mga PWD dun.

around october, pinatawag ako ng TM at OM ko kasi gusto nila malaman san nagstart lahat. eto na yung time na may idea na yung kateam ko na may escalation na kasi madami silang kilala. 16 kami lahat na nasa gc. iniyakan ko pa sila sa TL ko and sabi ko na pwede wag na lang ma-escalate sa HR kasi nakakaawa din sila, need ng iba yung work. but sadly, ayaw ni OM. nung kinausap ako ni OM, galit na galit siya. alam niyang nagdadalawang isip ako mag kwento kaya nag sorry siya sakin na naexperience ko daw yung ganung klaseng environment. di daw yun yung navision niyang workplace samin. and natouch pako nun kasi natandaan pala ako ni OM kasi nag tribal talk siya sa wave namin.

nagets ko din yung side ng TM ko and OM namin kaya pinakita ko sa kanila yung content nung gc. yun kasi yung hiningi nila sakin. permission to check ng mga chats. and dun nila nalaman lahat. nakita nila na yung mga pambabastos ng mga kateam ko sa mga officers, kapwa agents at sa PWD. yung mga cluster meeting din na confidential na dapat officers lang may alam, andun din sa gc namin kasi nga may 2 QA na involved dun. dun nag start lumaki yung issue hanggang sa umabot sa OD namin and gusto silang idissmiss.

nung nalaman ng kateam ko to, sila na yung kusang nag resign pero it came with a price. expected ko naman din na ako talaga yung pagbubuntunan nila ng galit.

october 3rd week, everyday ako nakareceive ng long message nila na puro mura and mga salitang di mo na maimagine. sa lahat ng gc na meron kami nagmemessage din sila dun para lang mamura ako. inignore ko lahat yun kasi alam kong kasalanan ko din naman. siguro mga 6 days din bago ko sila iblock lahat and sa mga gc naman sila biglang nag message kaya nag leave na din ako dun.

mula nung mabasa ko mga messages nila, dun ako nag breakdown. naisip ko nun na sana di na lang ako nag salita. sana katulad ako ng iba na walang pakialam. basta nakikisama lang, okay na. kumbaga kahit mga bully yung kasama eh okay lang, tahimik lang sa gilid, taga tawa lang. inisip ko yun na siguro di ako paggtutulungan ng mga bully or dati kong kateam. everyday ako umiiyak nun kasi nagsisisi ako na bakit sakin pa nangyari yung ganung situation. masyado akong emotional sa mga bagay bagay. tinanong ko din kay God nun bat ako pa, na alam niyang mahina ako sa mga masasamang sinasabi sakin.

naappreciate ko din yung TL ko kasi every time na nagchachat ako sa kanya ng screenshot ng chat nila, eh alam niyang cue na niya tumawag kasi alam niyang umiiyak ako. siya yung isa sa mga naging support ko through that battle lalo yung natitirang 4 kong kawave na pinalakas talaga loob ko.

13 silang nawala sa company. 13 yung nawalan ng trabaho. sa dami nila halos kakilala na din nila mga tao sa cluster namin na kinalat nila nung nangyare and balak pala nilang ihate ako ng buong cluster. sinabihan nilang mag ingat daw sakin kasi pina-HR ko daw sila.

may recent pang nangyari, kateam namin sa ibang LOB chinat ko kasi balak sana namin mag ambagan para sa TL naming bagong kasal. tinanong niya ako tips daw para maregular. sinagot ko na follow lang siya lagi ng resources na provided and updates ng mga QA. akala ko kasi genuine yung tanong. biglang reply sakin, “ah akala ko kasi magsumbong” tas sabay pa yung chat niya sa chat kong may ambagan nga kami, kaya nung nabasa ko yun nireply ko na lang na if di naman alam yung issue sana wag na lang makisali. nag haha react tas tinanong niya ilan daw ambagan, seseen ko lang sana pero sinend niya ulit tanong nung di ako nag reply after 5 minutes.

then today, kakauwi ko lang din galing sa gala with college friends and biglang nag pop yung old gc namin ng july pa sa pinakaungang team and may mga sinasabi na naman sila dun.

so ayun, ABYG dahil naescalate sa HR at OM yung mga pambabastos ng teammates ko sa PWD and ibang officers at agents? ",3,1733089823.0,AkoBaYungGago,4,1.0,False
1h4eklx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h4eklx,Happy 1st advent from Adolf Fredrik Church celebrating it’s 250 year anniversary!,"Today is 1st advent, the most attended mass of the entire year and one of the few times when many from the secular majority attend church. It’s the beginning of the Church year and more generally the Christmas season, and therefore a grand celebration with a sort of special magic in the air. There are lit candles, trumpets and the extra ceremonial vestments. But most of all the voices of several hundreds of people singing together. Adolf Fredrik Church in Stockholm, Sweden is a Neo-classical cross-shaped church whose construction started in 1768 and was (almost) finished in 1774 when it was inaugerated by the bishop on 1st advent.  It was actually financed by tolls put on bringing in coffee and tobacco into the city. So today was an extraordinary celebration as it was also the 250 year anniversary of the church. It lies next to a very busy main street in the most central parts of the inner city. This area was affected much by the demolitions of the 1960s and was depopulated to a large degree, but it is still active. But a regular Sunday mass only has about 25 people are in attendance. Today though, most of the 800 seats were occupied! They have an astonishing 8 choirs and offer many concerts. 
The fantastic altarpiece is quite unusual as it is visually integrated into the wall. It was made by one of the most famous Swedish sculptors Johan Tobias Sergel in the late 18th century.
Some trivia: one of the greatest minds of the 17th century, French philosopher, mathematician, scienctist and lawyer Rene Descartes hastily succumbed to the harsh climate and died by pneumonia just two or three months after arriving in Stockholm. He was buried in the Adolf Fredrik churchyard for a few years before his remains were brought to France and a monument was raised to him inside the building. Also, Sweden's social democratic prime minister Olof Palme who was world famous during the Cold War was murdered close to the church and lies buried in its churchyard where many people still come to pay respect.
Lastly, the cupola paintings visible in pictures 8,9 were made later, in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Also, the altarpiece is actually just made out of gypsum, preliminary I guess, and the plans to turn it into marble was never realised. Well, all in all it was really heartwarming to see the old and sometimes a bit overlooked church so filled with people for once, and I hope you all also had a wonderful 1st advent!

He was saying gross and racist words like ""You never understand what is asked, get back to your country"" whereas the barista have had already made a second drink for the client.

The barista, tired of being yelled at, threw coffee at the client's face and told to get to his manager if he was unsatisfied. 

When I got my order, the barista confessed to me that he didn't understand what the client wanted for his beverage.

Speaking of conversations,  I long to talk to you.  Your insights into my struggles are comforting and safe; like you.  I have never been my authentic self until I met you.   You bring out the best in me.  I find myself wanting to be a better person because I know that I matter to you.   That word holds value that only you comprehend.   The first time you used it, I held back tears.  There have been several times when I felt like you were reading my mind and knew exactly what I needed to hear.  You know how vulnerable I am around you.  No one has ever made me feel so safe.  You told me that you can see the little boy in me.  No one has ever told me that.   No one has ever taken the time to understand me, my trauma,  my wounds.  Until you.  I have needed your love and understanding for my whole life.  If there is a higher power,  then it put you in my life.   I know you love me as much as you can right now.   I suspect that you have lots of feelings that you keep to yourself.   

I want to talk to you everyday.   I want to hold you in my arms and fall asleep together.   I want to wake you up with a wonderful cup of coffee.   I want to hold hands and skip down the sidewalk together.   When you look at me, your whole face lights up with a smile.   I imagine coming in the door from a long day at the office and being greeted with that gorgeous smile, one of your healing hugs and a kiss.  Then it doesn't matter what we do as long as it's with you; my beautiful human.  

One day, we will have each other.

* Engage in some of my other forgotten hobbies (e.g. making cards, baking) when I am bored/tired

I'm currently living at home rent free so am able to save a lot of money but I am planning on moving out soon and want to really confront my bad habits properly. The last time I was renting I barely saved anything so it'd be nice to change that this time round!

1h4ebqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1h4ebqo/the_ledger_of_the_lost/,The Ledger of the Lost,"The rain pattered against the cracked glass of a gas station window, refracting neon lights into a kaleidoscope of broken dreams. Inside, a lone figure sat in the corner booth, hunched over a steaming cup of coffee. His clothes, frayed at the edges and damp from the downpour, hinted at the transience of his existence. Yet, his demeanor—back straight, eyes alert—spoke of a man unbroken.

I first noticed him because of his hands. They were clean, calloused only in the way of someone who had spent years typing furiously at a keyboard, not working the docks or begging on street corners. The contrast jarred me, and as I approached to refill my own cup of black coffee, I was overcome by curiosity.

“You mind if I sit here?” I asked, trying not to startle him.

He looked up, his eyes sharp and piercing beneath the brim of his waterlogged baseball cap. “Suit yourself,” he said, his voice steady, betraying none of the weariness one might expect from someone in his situation.

I sat down, and after a moment, he asked, “What are you doing out this late, kid?”

“Studying,” I said. “I’m an accounting major. Finals are next week.”

At that, his lips quirked into a smile—sad, almost wistful. “Accounting,” he repeated, as though the word itself carried a heavy weight.

“You know something about it?” I asked, leaning forward.

The man chuckled, a sound both weary and amused. “I *was* an accountant once. CPA, licensed in two states.”

The words hit me like a gut punch. I had assumed he was just another casualty of life’s cruel twists, but this revelation changed everything.

“You’re kidding,” I said, almost reflexively.

“I’m not,” he replied, leaning back in his chair and cradling the coffee cup like it was the only warmth he had left. “Graduated top of my class. Landed a job at Deloitte right out of college. Spent years in audit, then tax. Got the fancy title, the big bonuses, the whole nine yards.”

I could hardly believe it. “So, what happened?”

He shrugged, a gesture that seemed to carry the weight of years. “Burnout, mostly. The hours, the pressure, the endless grind—it eats at you. One day, I realized I’d been chasing promotions and paychecks for so long that I couldn’t remember *why* I started. And when I looked up, there was nothing left. My marriage, my health, my happiness—all gone.”

He paused, his gaze drifting to the rain-soaked parking lot. “I tried to stick it out, but the cracks were already there. Eventually, I walked away. Spent the next few years drifting—bartending, freelancing, odd jobs. Never quite got my footing again.”

“But why this?” I asked, gesturing vaguely to his tattered clothes and the worn duffel bag by his feet. “You had the skills. The credentials. You could’ve rebuilt.”

He laughed then, a deep, resonant sound that startled the sleepy clerk behind the counter. “You don’t rebuild when the foundation’s gone, kid. You start over. And starting over doesn’t always mean going back to what you were. Sometimes it means finding something entirely new.”

“What did you find?” I asked, genuinely curious.

“Freedom,” he said simply. “No deadlines, no meetings, no clients breathing down my neck. Just me, the road, and the occasional gig to keep me fed and dry. It’s not glamorous, but it’s honest. And for the first time in decades, I’m at peace with who I am.”

I sat there, stunned into silence. The man’s story defied every expectation I had, every notion of success and failure I had been taught.

As the rain began to let up, he drained the last of his coffee and stood, pulling his duffel onto his shoulder. “Good luck with your finals, kid,” he said, his tone almost paternal. “And remember—money isn’t everything. Don’t let the world convince you otherwise.”

With that, he walked out into the night, leaving me to sit in that fluorescent-lit booth, pondering the path I was on and the price of the dreams I chased.",1,1733089166.0,Accounting,1,1.0,False

Memory transcript subject:  Sebastian Northrop, unhappy churchgoer  

Standardized Human time: August 2nd, 2136

I slid the songbook back into the little rack in front of me as Sunday service came to an end, Sundays were the only days I wasn’t on the bunker site and that the men got off. 

I filed out with the rest of my family out of the service room and into the main room where after-service snacks and coffee were set up, Lesia was waiting for Miss Penny to bring the kids up from the basement. 

I always had a bit of a crush on Penny. Her fiery red hair, emerald green eyes, and sunny yellow shirt, which she always wore when she taught Sunday school, made it hard for me to keep focused. 

When she entered the main room to hand off the children I pulled out my phone so I would stop staring and not look like a creep. 

I checked the notifications I got whilst service was going and saw that I got an email…*from work!*

Just by the little preview, it wasn’t looking good, I still had at least one more week of my vacation! What could they want?!?

My heart sank as I read the message, I was being ordered to come back to work early and immediately they already had a private flight set up for me! They can’t do this to me! I still had work to do at the bunker site!

I put my phone in my pocket and tried to ignore it for now, not wanting to throw a fit whilst in the house of the lord and instead swallowing my anxiety and anger with the cheese and crackers offered for fellowship as the other churchgoers mingled and talked, my folks talked to their friends, Sophie and Brad played with their friends and here I was sulking whilst in the presence of stale coffee filling the air. 

I patiently waited for the rest of my family to be done socializing before joining them on the way out of the church, the late summer sun hitting us as we went to our cars, I rode with Mom and Dad whilst Lessia and her family went into their car. 

Dad drove whilst mom took up the front passenger seat leaving me in the back alone, before we started moving I took out my phone to reread the email hoping I just misread it but unfortunately the words remained the same, my vacation is being cut short via emergency order from the top brass.

I considered trying to exploit my personal connection to General Jones and whining to her about how unfair it is that they're making me leave home early but I only got so many favors with the general that it might be better spent on something more substantial.

As I was thinking back to how the general and I met when I was more or less an apprentice in weapon designing I heard my mom talking to my dad about something, only tuning in when I heard my name.

“Sebby is being called back to work,” She told him, twenty-three years old and I never bothered to boot her out of my email or bank accounts. For better or worse this instance saved me from trying to explain to her why I wasn’t quite the pinnacle of positivity right now.

“When?” My father asked whilst taking a glance back at me

“Like, right now! They're calling it an emergency order or something.” 

All I can think of is how short notice it was, they couldn’t have told me this yesterday or something, give me some time to pack before telling me that there's a plane on the runway waiting for me. 

I knew as soon as we got home I’d have to start packing if I wanted to stay in the good graces of the top brass. I was their poster boy for robotics, after all, no one cared for the trash-skimmer fleet I made.

The school of whale-shark inspired ocean trash eaters was my favorite creation, only if everyone else felt the same, they only cared about the autonomous war machines, tanks, planes, submarines and the like. 

My recollection of my creations was cut when I realized that we’re home! This has to be the only time I’ve been upset to be home! When I exited the car I dragged my feet to the porch, the other half of the family went grocery shopping so at least it saves me from having to explain my sentence over and over again. 

I slowly went upstairs as my parents went to the living room to enjoy their time off. When I got to my room I found the suitcase I brought with me and started to repack all the clothes I had, mixing both clean and dirty. Not really caring at this point. I practically had a second home at the compound anyway. 

I made sure I had everything, clothes, toothbrush, chargers, devices, shoes…shoot almost forgot Vern! I grabbed the plushy buck from under my pillow and put him in my suitcase, he’s one of my favorite plushies to sleep with! 

I contemplated trying to squeeze the blobfish pillow stuffie as well but not bothering to, seeing as I already feared being mocked if anyone found out I still slept with stuffed animals! 

Once my little emotional support deer was securely packed I lugged my blue carry-on downstairs trying my best to not fall down on them as I did so. 

“Did you pack everything?” My mom asked as she came from the kitchen holding a big Christmas food container 

“Yes Mom.” I groaned having already just double-checked everything but now she was making me doubt myself.

I took the container and shook it a little, it sounded like it was full of cookies and by how heavy one side was it must also have mom's banana bread! 

Before I could say anything my mom hugged me

“I know you don't wanna but I’m proud of you for not making a fuss.” she said before my father walked up to hug me when she let go.

“Love ya bud!” Dad said he’s about the only person that’s around my size so his hugs were just a little more secure than Mom's as much as I loved her. 

“Love ya too,” I said as he let go, I really didn’t want to go, I felt like my time would be better spent trying to help build the bunker but the powers that be see it differently. As I opened the door and walked to my car I felt a sense of dread, like I was walking to my execution or something but it must just be my nerves.

My folks stayed inside as I turned on my car and peeled out the driveway knowing it’ll be a long drive to the airport, not even thinking about the fact that I didn’t say bye to the kids or Lisa until I was in the middle of the highway.

\[Time skip: 6 hours\]

I leaned my head against the glass of the SUV I was being shuttled in, watching the desert go by as the AC blew in an attempt to stave off this blasted heat! Why couldn’t they have made another skunkworks in New England!?! It’s so hot and dry out here! 

And the jetlag! I'm so fucking tired but it just turned into the afternoon around here! 

Just as I was getting comfortable enough to fall asleep I feel the car slow causing me to open my eyes in disdain, what perfect fucking timing! 

“We’re here Mister Northrop.” The driver said as he got out of the car to get my luggage for me, It took some willpower to not mutter ‘Well no shit’ as I exited the vehicle myself, I take the handle of the suitcase when it was handed to me and stare at that damned skunk, mouth agape and arms crossed!

“Get back to work slacker” Is what it was saying to me before I realized I must look crazy staring at the mascot before getting a move on, not bothering to acknowledge the driver like I should’ve.

I got ready to get through the security checkpoint opening my wallet to show my badge but before I could pull it through I got the go-ahead.

“All set to go Mister Northrop.” one of the officers said, opening the express pass for me, I just leered at him, what if I had a bomb? What if there were guns in my suitcase? Just because they see me as special doesn’t mean I can't be a threat to the building! 

I just gave a half-hearted nod as I walked through the expressway, following the path I have so many times before to the onsite living quarters, not paying anything else much mind as the suitcase rolled behind me.

I didn’t plan on leaving my room for a full twelve hours, just struggling to stay awake so that I can try and get my sleep schedule to this timezone…thank god for caffeine! 

…

Once in my quarters I tossed my suitcase on the bed and laid next to it, pulling out my phone to rot my brain for an hour not having the willpower to unpack my luggage right this instant.

As I scrolled through the endless content I noticed that there was this back-and-forth of content being for and against the Venlil, some saying that they can’t be trusted to some saying that we should welcome them with open arms.

I rolled my eyes at the extremists at both ends of the spectrum, some saying that the Venlil are godless demons to those thinking we should just hand over the keys to the kingdom to them since they're more advanced than us and they know better bla bla bla.

I got sick of the divisiveness and turned off my phone, knowing I should probably start unpacking. The clothes went first then toiletries and lastly my laptop, I placed it next to my desktop I had set up here and noticed that the web that was spun in front of my setup was empty! 

Guess without my messy habits to keep the fruit fly population up and without me there to open the window at night poor Francis must’ve gotten hungry or worse and left, that little cellar spider was like a pet to me! 

It saddened me a little to no longer have a little eight-legged critter hanging on my wall, occasionally blowing on his web to see him skitter around to hide was something that always helped me through moments of my brain malfunctioning, now all I have is his dust-covered web, it doesn't even move the same way without ‘em! 

Sure it was hypocritical of me to be saddened by the absence of the spider when I fear any arachnid when they were close to me but he was just at that perfect distance where he couldn’t touch me but I could easily see him! 

Is there anything sacred in this damn place!?! 

Seeing the empty web has sucked out the last of my emotional energy, being done with today I gathered my PJs for the night and went through my nighttime routine, shower, teeth brushed, not bothering to shave tonight, and throwing myself into the mattress once the suitcase was pulled onto the floor! 

Grumbling as I had to get up to turn off the light and turning on the bedside lamp to stave off the deep darkness so my paranoia doesn’t get the best of me! 

With Vern in my arms and my sleep mask blocking out the light of my lamp I finally got some damn sleep!

Acting as a counselor with experience in cluster B personality disorders, please review my question about my wife.  

We are constantly dealing with some kind of issue. We have been married for 10.5 years and have two children.  

My wife wanted to divorce me last summer and told me it was because I wasn’t meeting her needs, wasn’t showing up in the ways that made her feel loved and that she generally wasn’t happy in the marriage. She also stated she was bored. 

We both separated last summer, attended individual counseling and began to rekindle our relationship. 

We got back together in July of last year and things seemed to be great for about 5 months. 

Then things began to change again. 

Constantly she told me that I was not making her a priority, I wasn’t being a “loving husband” and I was hurting her deeply. 

I am a loving husband and take our kids to school and pick them up a majority of the time, make most of the meals, clean the house daily and weekly, pick up groceries, do laundry and ensure my wife’s scrubs for work are clean and tuck our children into bed a majority of the time. 

I buy my wife flowers on a weekly basis, and drop off love letters on her car at work to make sure she knows I’m thinking about her. 

I ask about her day, ask how I can best show up for her and make her feel supported. 

We still argue constantly. If I make a phone call to my friend, she tells me that I have prioritized him over her and that my actions are not that of a loving husband. 

She constantly calls me sketchy and says I cannot be trusted. Her reason for this is because when our marriage was having problems, I reached out to family to vent and seek support. 

She said I had breached her trust and could no longer be trusted. She has accused me of cheating multiple times although I never have. 

She told me to quit my personal counselor or she would divorce me. 

We will resolve and issue, or so she says, and then it is brought up many times in different and unrelated situations. 

I feel like I’m going crazy trying to follow the path of our arguments. Often, one thing will occur and she will bring up multiple other things from the past as “proof” that she is correct about her feelings. 

If I want to take some time to myself to go read alone at a coffee shop or work on my computer, she will often ask why I can’t just do it at home. When I tell her I’d just appreciate some quiet time and a different environment, she has called me selfish and said “you have 2 kids! What if they need your help?” Even if she would be home with them. 

I’m often guilted during trips away for work or with friends that I could’ve spent the weekend with her and that’s what she would do but I made a decision to prioritize my friends over her. 

She has told me I shouldn’t want to hang out with my friends until she feels better about our marriage. 

She gets upset when I go out of town on a work trip and even though I was texting with her all day, she said I did not prioritize her as I didn’t call her on the phone. She then dug through our phone records and questioned me about phone calls to my friend that were months ago. She called me a liar and argued with me for hours about this. 

I had a perceived “tone” in my voice a few weeks ago and the fight lasted nearly 45 minutes. She said my ego was in the way and I couldn’t take accountability for my actions. She said she deserved better than this and I should’ve known my tone was inappropriate and shouldn’t have done it. No matter how many times I apologized, it got worse and she continued to provide many examples of how my poor tone was rude and unnecessary. 

She tells me constantly that I should read between the lines and she shouldn’t have to tell me certain things and I should just know them. 

Her emotions seem to be “facts” in her head and there is no reasoning with her whatsoever. 

When she’s upset, she will shut down, shush me, and put stipulations on how our conversation will go. 

She told me I must express embarrassment and humility to her about my actions before she will engage in a conversation with me. 

Sometimes when she’s upset, she will act as if I’m not there and ignore me or be very cold to me for days on end.

My name’s Joshua Hernandez, but everybody calls me “*Pajarito*” or “*Pac*.” Well, except for my boss, Bill Harthwright - he likes to call me “‘Rito.” I’ve been at the Whispering Oaks Ranch in San Marcos, Texas for the past five years. Or, at least that’s what’s on the official record.

But really, I was born right on the ranch to my mamá, Maria Luisa. She didn’t even know she was carrying me on that hot August day, twenty-three years ago.

That morning, mamá said she was getting ready for the day but had some awful stomach pain. She was on the phone with my abuela Ixchel - who was recovering from surgery in a Tampa Bay rehab center. She called her every morning; just before they served their stale breakfast.

The call was always right after Walter Mercado’s *Telemundo* show finished, ending with “*Mucho, mucho amor.*” It was my grandma’s favorite. 

Something my abuela said stuck with mamá. She said, “*Walter says, ‘I am born and make my debut every day. Others pile on the years.’ Isn’t that so poetic*?” Mamá got heated and asked, “*Yeah, but what does it mean?*” Abuela just told her to, “*Wait and see.*”

That’s when the pain got worse and she groaned, “*Lo siento, mamá. Tengo salir, tengo mucho dolor en mi estomago. (Sorry, mom, I have to go, my stomach is in a lot of pain.)*” Nothing she took could ease the pain, not even epazote.

After lunch, she was sprinkling sawdust in the stables and sweating hard. Bill came by with some cold water. He spilled a little of the drink on himself and he and mamá laughed at the mess together. And wouldn’t you know it– that’s just when mamá’s water broke.

“*Luckily, over the sawdust*,” she always chuckled when she told the story. Bill and the other stablehands brought her into the guest room and called for a doctor. But as soon as they called, I made my debut into this world, screeching like a baby bird. Mamá said I kind of looked like one, too, with how pink and hairless I was. That’s why everybody calls me “*Pajarito.”*

# Chapter 1: The Girl Who Was on the Mountain

Mamá’s memory isn’t so good now. A few years after my abuela passed, she was diagnosed with *Early Onset Alzheimer’s*. She’s only fifty-three now, but her memory fades bit by bit. That’s why I get up early to spend time with her and make her breakfast before work. Today it’s a tray of *huevos divorciados* with a hard bolillo roll, a cup of black coffee, and two packets of sugar.

I knock on the door and hear a soft, “*Come in, mijo.*”

Mamá wasn’t looking at me. She stared out the window, wearing her old pink nightgown. It was still dark, but I could hear the birds fluttering outside. I set the tray down on a side table and looked at her.

She said she didn’t know my father’s real name even before she got sick. I think that’s a good thing. She remembers meeting him at a party; he was a big man dressed in black and his dark, piercing eyes looked at her and only her. When he moved over for her to sit with him, mamá saw he only had one leg. 

He plied her with gifts and golden trinkets, promising her the most beautiful things. She fell in love with him, or, at least who he pretended to be. 

He brought her to the Northern mountaintops; a long ways away from her home in the cornfield. She didn’t know how she got there so quick, but she did. And then, well, I happened. 

But it was like he knew she was pregnant before she ever did. He turned into a real monster and kept that poor girl trapped in his mountaintop home. But just like she didn’t know the real him - he didn’t know Maria Luisa. 

My mamá packed a rucksack and a broken vase shard before saying a prayer and trekking down that mountain, barefoot and pregnant. She promised herself that she would stay alive for her family and would never let my father take her again. 

Exhausted, mamá passed out in the cornfield. Her two brothers found her gripping the treasures against her chest. When she awoke, she had them sell off the jade and gold jewelry and used that money to give her family a better life. Her older sister stayed behind, but mamá took care of her just the same.

That simple girl from Flores, Guatemala outsmarted a man, trekked down a mountain, and kept the treasure. It sounds like a fairy tale. The only person left to tell that story is my mamá. My abuela and tios, Francisco and Mateo, passed a few years back, and I never met my Auntie.

Just the same, I’m Maria Luisa’s boy and damned proud of it. I’ve worked here on this ranch practically all my life. Bill and Juan Harthwright - the ranch owners, are still around; the old buzzards. But they always treated us like family. We break bread together, spend the holidays together, and get covered in horse shit together.

Even now, they make sure we’re taken care of. They pay for mamá’s caregiver while I’m gone. But I still make sure I’m around when I can.

I gently placed my hand on her shoulder and asked, “*Buenos días, mamá. (Good morning, mom)* *Did you sleep well?*” She turned to look at me and grabbed my hand, “*Por supuesto, Mijo, (Of course, my child) when I have you.*” I kissed her forehead and sat on the bed.

She looked at me and asked, “*Did you eat?*” I shook my head, “*Not hungry, you eat up. Got a long day ahead of you with Deja*.” Her brow crinkled, “*Quién? (Who?)*” There was a lump of ice in my chest, but I swallowed and said, “*You know Deja... the one with the long braids.*”

Her face relaxed, “Ah, *que bonita (ah, the pretty one)*. *Yes, I remember. She likes to move around a lot… I’ve noticed you looking at her.*” I carefully placed the cup of coffee in her hands and playfully asked, “*Do you like to move around?*”

She took a sip before saying, “*Le sigo la corrienter… (I follow along…)* eh, I like sometimes.“ I replied, “*Well, it’s good for your body, mamá. I love you.*” 

She smiled up at me with recognition, “*I love you too,* *mi tz'ik. Dio te bendiga…(my little bird. God be with you...)*”  I smiled at the rare Kekchi she used, it was always so soft and sweet. Then she looked down into her black coffee and murmured, “*...I promise.*” Confused, I asked her, “*Promise what, mamá?*”

Then came an interrupting knock on the door. I decided not to stress over what mamá had said. So, I grabbed my bags, threw on my leather boots, and tucked my Ruger into its holster. 

I opened the door to mamá’s caregiver, Deja. She's a beautiful dark-skinned woman with thick lips and deep-brown eyes you could melt in. Today, she plaited her black hair and wrapped it in gold and green wires. I always loved seeing what she did with her hair. Hell, she’d even look good bald. 

Deja greeted me, “Hey Pac! How’s it going?... Pac?” I shook my head to stop staring, “Oh, sorry! I’m no good in the morning if it ain’t about horses.” She smiled, showing her pretty gap teeth, and waved her hand away, “No worries, I’ll take care of your mom. You go focus on the stables.” She winked and my heart melted.

She dug in her bag, “Oh, before you go - I got something for you. Your mamá made it the other day. It was cool to learn about these dolls, so maybe I’ll have to put one under my pillow.”

Deja handed me an object wrapped in tissue paper, grazing my hand as she passed it to me. It was a little doll with stick arms wearing a colorful *traje* and a *cinta* for its hair. I remember having one a long time ago, but this one was new. I smiled at her and tucked it in my back pocket, “Thank you kindly. For everything.”



# Chapter 2: The Whispering Oaks Ranch

I waved goodbye then hopped in my dusty truck, making my way to the Whispering Oaks Ranch. Despite the name, there’s nothing too quiet about the ranch. Not with the horses whinnying, crowds screaming, and all the machinery going ‘round at all hours of the day.

I do like the horses, though. I don’t get to train them too often but I do have *Corazón*. She’s a warmblood mare about my age and I’ve taken care of her since I was a little niño. We’ve both gotten on in years but she can still run like the wind. 

While Corazón is my main girl, there are a hundred other horses we got.

There’s one Chestnut mare, in particular, who is a problem in the stables. Her name’s “Nutmeg,” and she’s got a fire in her eyes and a thirst for blood. Ask me how I know and I’ll show you the teeth marks from that time I offered her a carrot. 

Flat-handed, mind you.

That hell-spawn is the responsibility of Dallas Harthwright, Bill’s nephew from Austin. Even worse is that she’s extra mean now that she’s carrying a foal and Dallas barely keeps a handle on her. At least, if Bill ain’t around. When he’s nearby, they’re as sweet as peach pie.

Other than that, Dallas is a real show-off. That ain’t too bad when there’s guests, but he don’t know when to turn it off. Right now it’s summer and nobody would dare be out in this heat. So he graces the staff with that attention.

One summer, Juan asked for Dallas’ help in selling extra grass seeds. So, this fool left the ranch’s number on a stall in some trucker bathroom offering, “Ass for Grass”. The line was tied up for a whole week with a ton of perverts. Though, the place did make a few sales for its troubles.

Dallas also has a habit of pranking the rest of us. His favorite is finding dead snakes and hiding them in our toolboxes. Once, he even clipped some to our lariats just before we set off to ride. And I say once because he barely missed a kick to the head from one of the mares. Scared him straight, I suppose.

There was also that time he hid the tractor by the creek during the off-season. Surprise surprise; it slipped halfway into the water.

Bill made Dallas take apart the whole damn thing and wash it top to bottom, change the oil pan, and grease the wheels. He didn’t let Dallas stop until his hands were cramped and tired. 

The creek is dried up now and I’m pretty sure it’s starting to become a sinkhole thanks to the summer heat. Either way, I doubt Dallas would try that trick again.

I still don’t know how Bill tolerates that man– even if he is blood.

Still, Dallas is a mild disturbance compared to the natural dangers of the ranch. Whether it's coyotes or entitled guests; there’s always something wanting to take you out.

A scared horse can kick you in the head and send you straight to *el paraíso* before you can even blink.

Rattlesnakes without god-damned rattles are popping up all over and ready to strike. And you know why they’re like that? Because colonizers brought over some hogs, they escaped and ate the noisy rattlers. So now they’re regular, rattle-less snakes.

I pulled up next to the Harthwright’s two-story house and noted how much cooler the air is than normal. I slung my bags over my shoulder and stepped up the rickety wooden steps of their porch. I could already smell the fresh coffee.

I knocked on the door and Bill opened it. He’s an albino man with tomato-red skin, just a little taller than me with curly wisps of coarse white hair and a curly beard. He’s wearing his black and red outfit with a bolo tie and a wide-brimmed hat. Bill completes the look with a pair of sunglasses to protect his deep red eyes. Looks like a country-fried Santa Claus if you squint.

I never understood why he stays in Texas. But Bill always says, “*Not ‘een God can take me outta God’s country.*”

The older man grunted and put a hand on my shoulder, “*How yer’ doin’ ‘ere, Pa-ha-reeto? Enjoying the cool breeze?*” His breath smelled of coffee and tobacco chew. 

I smiled and clapped my hand on his other shoulder, “*I can enjoy it after a hot cup of coffee and a concha*.” Bill kissed his teeth, “*Well, yer better be faster than uh hare on ah oil slick, son.*”

He let me into the house and I snatched a pink concha from a box on the table. Juan always buys huge boxes from the local panaderia, *Gordipan*. I figure he has stock in the company with how much he’s bought. Next to the box is a metal dispenser filled with hot lifeblood– glorious coffee. I poured some into a styrofoam cup and sat at the table.

There’s a smattering of dirty paper plates covered with the remnants of biscuits and gravy in the trash.  an old gallon of vinegar filled with Bill’s homemade hot sauce sat on the center of the table.

There are a few others sitting with me. There’s Phil, an older lanky brown-haired guy with a trucker cap. He’s hunched over his dollar store puzzle book, drawing lines with a tiny pencil. He nodded at me and gave a thin-lipped smile before returning to his puzzle. 

Phil doesn’t say much. But he’s our local traveling veterinarian and one of the few left here that works with large animals. Right now, he’s staying to assist with our foaling mares overnight and enjoy most of the ranch to himself. 

I heard in passing that Phil used to be an actor. I’m not much of a theater fan myself. I’m more into watching those supernatural shows about ghosts ‘cause they don’t cost an arm and a leg to see. 

I was always into supernatural stuff; when me and Dallas were kids, Bill gave us a camera to play around with. Told us it could detect ghosts and evil spirits. Then he had us strap it to a tree at the edge of the property. 

It took us a whole week to realize we weren’t looking at flesh-hungry ghouls in the night; but into the glowing eyes of a giant stag. Still, when those things are in a rut and making their calls at night, you’d swear a demon just sprung up out of the earth. 

Then there’s Emily, a blonde sharpshooter with a powerful voice. Her daddy owns the biggest Vietnamese crawfish place in San Marcos, but she prefers fresh air over steamed water bugs. Emily’s real smart, too. Doesn’t shoot every coyote she sees - only the ones that get too brave and want to try out some fresh horse meat. 

She was scraping up the last bits of gravy onto a fluffy biscuit when she looked up and asked, “*Hey Pac, how’s it goin’?*” I reply, “*Just fine, Emily. Just fine*.” Her pair of hunting buddies are by her feet - two Corgis named Tater and Hash

And finally, there’s the wild-eyed Dallas Harthwright. He has night vision goggles strapped to his forehead as he plays the five-finger filet with his whittling knife hovering over a napkin in the corner. Everybody ignores it, probably hoping he slips up so we can get some peace and quiet for a minute.

A few dozen other folks walk in to toss out their dirty plates and grab their walkie-talkies. We greet each other in passing as I finish my coffee and stare at the whiteboard for what we need to do today.

Running a ranch takes a lot of work. It’s more than cleaning stables and feeding horses. We need to check and repair fences, mow the edges, and keep this place running. On top of that, today we need to move the wheel line sprinklers around the property for the pastures. That was a job for me, Bill, and Dallas after we took care of the stables.

Juan Harthwright is in the kitchen, leaning against the doorframe and holding a cup of coffee. He’s a little shorter than me with short black hair that’s starting to gray and dark brown skin like my abuela. He’s dressed in a blue version of Bill’s outfit with a vest.

Juan nods his head at me before taking a sip of his decaf coffee, “Hola hijo, *cómo vas con tú mamá? (Hey kid, how are things going with your mom?)”* I frown, “*Mas o menos…mas o menos (so-so…so-so)*.” His eyes soften as he sets down his mug on the table, “*I’ll be sure to visit soon, okay*?” I smiled, “*Yeah, that will be great, tío. Muchas gracias. (Thank you.)*”

Bill grabbed his keys and downed the remaining coffee left in Juan’s mug, He looks at the table, “*Rippin’ an’ rarin’ ta go?*” Juan whistles then says, “*After you put on some sunscreen, jefazo (boss)*.” Bill’s face scrunches up behind those big sunglasses as he tucks a gob of chew into his cheek, “*Don’t matter none. Not when ah been lippin’ it fer damn near forty years*.”

Juan cocked his head and raised a brow at the man. Embarrassed, Bill turned on his heel to find his sunscreen.

The gang hooped and hollered as Bill walked off. Juan set his eyes on us and pointed his finger at a door then put it to his mouth.

We zipped our mouths shut, grabbed our walkie-talkies, and shuffled to the yard. I shoved the rest of my snack in my mouth as we left.

Bill came out a few minutes later while Dallas and I loaded his truck with rope, shovels, pipes, and some hacksaws. We all squeezed into the cab and set off to the pasture.

Whispering Oaks is about eighty acres with plenty of natural ponds and creeks. There’s ziplining, little cabins for campers who only want to rough it a little bit, and a lot of other fun stuff for them to enjoy and for us to maintain. We take good care of the property, but everything else is pretty much a jungle.

We hopped out of the truck and looked at the map in Bill’s hands, noting plots where old lines were buried and what to avoid.

The pasture is divided into four paddocks. In the center of the two vertical halves is some concrete with shelter, water, and some dry feed.

Emily is already around guiding the horses to the next paddock. Her corgis are right at her heels. They’re well-trained dogs, but it gets dicey when you have a hundred horses with the instinct to stomp the wolf blood out of those little puppies. Still, the trio and a dozen other stablehands rotate the horses to the next pasture, so we can get to work.

I saw Corazón munching grazing and walked towards her with a treat bucket in hand, ensuring she would see me coming. She stopped to look at me as I squatted down, curled my hand into a loose fist, and presented my knuckles to her.

I whispered, “*Hey girl – how ya doing? Ready for the day?*” She sniffed my hand and I slipped a rope halter over her muzzle and walked her to the concrete center between the paddocks. A bunch of other folks had done the same.

I tied her to a pole and opened my grooming pack. I asked, “*Ready for your beauty treatment, lady?*” She snorted happily as I brushed her from mane to tail. I chuckled, “*Good, good. You about to get some fresh grub too once we finish*.”

Once she was all gussied up, I pulled out the treat bucket and let her gorge. You’d think she was still a filly with how smoothly she moves. I breathed a sigh of relief and enjoyed the warmth of the rising sun.

Then I heard whinnying and Dallas’ hooping and hollering, “*Come on girl! Let’s do this!*” I turned to see him riding Nutmeg with no saddle, no brindle, no nothing. Just embarrassing. I turned away and led my girl to the next paddock and put the temporary fencing back in place.



# Chapter 3: Soured Land



Then me, Dallas, and Bill worked on the sprinkler system. First, we shut it off at the source and then mowed the paddock edges. We started digging once that was done and then replaced, removed, and refit the water lines for hours. Last thing we had to do was put down some grass seeds and flush the system.

Bill had Dallas and me push an overseeder around when we were struck by a nauseating, hateful smell. It was worse than spoiled milk left in a locker over the summer, mixed with raw sewage, then steamed into an ass cake.

I almost hurled and Dallas had the nerve to grin and say, “*Aw, shit, Pac. Do we need to get you a new pair of pants?*” Then he *really* smelled it and covered his mouth with a bandana. I pinched my nose closed as tight as I could but my lungs burned like someone took a candle to them. This smell sure wasn’t here before.

We powered through with the overseeder until we found the source. It was hard to miss– all the nearby grass was rotted into a cloud of gray dust. Then we saw something strange moving a little way over. At first, we thought it was a brown paper bag that drifted over but it just kinda moved in place.

I waved down Bill as I choked on my bile.

When we got closer, we saw it wasn’t a bag. It was a whole snake, bloated up like it had an allergic reaction. Its fangs were hanging out its wide-open mouth like it was mid-strike. 

I signed the cross across my chest and even did the malocchio just for good luck.

I looked the whole thing over and saw its tail with rings and a little button on the end. It’s a juvenile rattlesnake with a now-rare rattle. So now something or someone else is targeting them. I turn to eye Dallas suspiciously.

I grabbed my walkie-talkie to let everybody know what’s going on. Bill interrupted me, angry and redder than ever, “*Boy, I swear if you had somethin’ to do wit’ this I’mma whoop yo ass so hard you’ll be knocked straight back to tha womb.*” He whipped his hat off and his voice shook a lil’ bit from all that hollering. And I can’t blame him. 

Dallas put his hands up in surrender, “*Hey! I had nothin’ to do with this, Unc. I swear!*”

Then Dallas had some nerve. He looked at the decrepit thing with a foolish smile, “*But it does look kinda cool…How the hell did this happen?*” He put his goggles over his face and inched closer to it while me and Bill backed away. Bill hollered, “*If you’on’t getcho’ ass back ‘ere, son! We ain’t got time tah be ‘vestigating aliens round ‘ere. Leave. It. Alone!*”

Too late. Dallas went and prodded that thing with the end of his shovel. The papery skin cracked open as soon as he touched it like the world’s worst piñata. The prize? A puff of black dust and its jerkied organs. Dallas held his bandana tighter to his face, coughing as he waved his hand at the smoke.

A bird let out a strange squawk in the distance and it half-sounded like laughter.

Now much further away, Bill shouted, “*Don’t touch it agin, nah, fool!*” He hobbled as quickly as he could and I ran after him to get to the truck. Bill turned, “*I’ll take care of tha truck, you flush out them lines. Ain’t no sense tryna’ come back ‘ere rightna’ wit whatever THAT shit is.*”

I stopped in my tracks, then turned back to the sprinkler and let it run clean. As soon as the sprinklers were set, Bill drove by and shouted, “*Get in n’ toss Dallas’ stuff in the bed. He ain’t finna touch’ nunna this shit til he gits wrenched orf*.” I hopped in the cab and haphazardly threw his stuff into the truck bed.

Bill shook his fist out the window and shouted, “*Git in tha back, ya idjit!*” Dallas straightened up and walked steadily towards us. I thought he looked mostly fine but, just in case, I rolled up my window as he walked past. He squished himself into the corner of the bed as we drove back to the house.

Everybody else was filing in for lunchtime, so Bill parked a ways away and led us to the shaded backyard. He pointed towards the glove department, “*There’s some bags in ‘ere, toss ‘em to Indiana Jones.*” I open it and toss a ball of crumpled old grocery store bags to Dallas. The fool hollered back, “*I ain’t sick!*”

Bill turned so fast, “*The hell you ain’t! Put yer garments in ‘ere so we can burn ‘em.*” And Dallas had the nerve to say, “*I just bought these!*” Bill eyed him, “*Looks like you’ll have tah go shoppin’ in ‘Les boutique LOST AN’ FOUN’!’, 'cause you ain’t bringing that SHIT in my house!*” Dallas crossed his arms and shook his head. Bill sighed, “*Fine, we ain’t finna’ burn em…but they shole as hell finna’ be covered in some sanitizer, that’s fer sure.*”

Dallas rolled his eyes, jumped out, and started stripping. Bill turned off the car and told me, “*Git some warshclothes an’ dish soap fer ‘im.*” He got out of the car and told Dallas, “*An’ you is finna stand yo’ ass in dat bucket over dere wit a hose. We’ll wipe it down after...hope you got uh tetanus shot.*” He pointed at an old rusty basin with a dry towel hanging out of it.

Dallas swung his arms in the air, “*Aw, damn! Why you gotta say it like that? I’mma get all cut up and cooked in there.*” Bill slammed the door shut and pointed his thumb back to the road, “*Oh, boo hoo. I’m fixin’ to cut n’ cook YOU up! You shole wasn’’t worried befo’!*”

Dallas snarled and folded the towel into the basin to protect his feet and ran the hose in. He set down a pack of cigarettes and his lighter on top of his boots. Bill turned to look at me and said, “*Gon’ head na. Git ta steppin’.*”

I made my way into the kitchen, evading all the other ranch hands. Juan held Tomás on his hip; a chunky, black-haired baby, about eleven months now. Juan swayed with him while stirring a big pot of his special *frijoles charros*. The child whined as his father worked.

He shushed his baby boy, and asked him, “P*obrecito, qué pasa, bebe? (Poor boy, what’s going on, baby?)*” I stepped into the kitchen to grab some dish soap and asked for some washcloths that he didn’t mind losing. He sighed, *“Dallas again?*” I nodded and replied, “It’s to be expected at this point.”

Juan danced around with Tomás, “*Tienes razón, por ahí. (You’re right, over there.*)” He pursed his lips in the direction of the counter. On it was a tomato-stained plastic container with some ratty but clean rags on them. Then he moved to the freezer, grabbed a pacifier, and offered it to his son, “*Por tus dientes, mijo. Te ayudará. (It’s for your teeth, my child. It will help you.)*”

I slipped out the materials for Dallas’ bubble bath. Bill made him scrub himself top to bottom three times before he could, “Wrench off” and get some victuals. And he still kept those damn goggles right on his head.

Dallas tossed on an old pair of overalls and started to move toward the house before Bill stopped him, “*Aht, aht! I’ll bring you a plate an’ a dixie cup*.” He moved his eyes towards me,”‘*Rito keep an eye on ‘im.*” Dallas rolled his eyes, “*Oh, come on!*” Bill hollered back, “*Yer lucky I ain’t firin’ your ass fer pokin’ round with that crazy thang!*” Then Bill stomped back to the house.

I leaned against the back porch and stared at Dallas who had snuck a cigarette to his lips. I raised a brow, “Y*ou ain’t had enough toxic sludge in your lungs today?*” He grinned, “*Hard to kick a habit even wit’ dusty lungs.*” I waved him off, “*Uhuh, just stay downwind from me.*” He shrugged, lit his cigarette, and took a big puff.

Bill returned with three big paper plates and plastic cups on a tray. They were topped with frijoles charros, tortillas, and some coleslaw. Juan also cut us each a piece of his honey butter cornbread. The cups were filled to the brim with sweet tea and ice. Bill passed me a plate, grabbed one for himself, and stepped away for Dallas to grab his meal.

I thought about what to even say to the rest of the crew as we sat there in the quiet and enjoyed our meal. When Dallas scraped the last bits of beans into his mouth, I spoke up, “*So, what are we going to say about all this?*”

Bill paused and scrunched his mouth, his face turning red because he didn’t reapply sunscreen. He looked up at the sky as clouds started to shade the ground. Then he said, “*Maybe we ‘on’t need ta say anythin’ ‘bout it jus’ yet. They can see fo’ themselves an’ me an’ Juan can see what’s wrong with tha soil over there. Jus’ gotta think about how to explain it…*”

The patio door opened and Juan walked out, gently guiding little Tomás by his arms, “*Explain what, jefazo (boss)?*” Bill sputtered and turned to look at Tomás, “*Hey, there’s ma lil’ man-man!*” The baby giggled upon seeing his father and Bill sat him on his lap.

Juan tapped the top of Bill’s hat and leaned over, “*You’re avoiding the question, miel (honey)…and your sunscreen.*” Bill opened his mouth to reply, but then the sky went dark with clouds that threatened to black out the sun. It's like they were running from something.

I looked up and saw a big black bird hanging on the oak tree. It didn’t have eyes but, somehow, I knew it was staring back at me. The bird hopped on its one foot and flew to safety before the weather worsened. I signed the cross on my chest, Dios mío.

Then the wind whistled and screamed like a banshee, making me press my hands to my ears in distress. My heart was thumping and my head was pounding as that nauseating smell struck again. Dust stung my eyes and mouth. I could only feel a deep dread inside of me as I tried to stay upright. 

Immediately, Bill clamped his hands to Tomás’ ears and the baby shrieked. Juan covered the pair with his body as the wind picked up. It pinned me against the stairs and forced Dallas to cling to the tree. His cigarette flew right outta his mouth.

Together, Bill and Juan pushed into the house for Tomás’ sake. I managed to wedge myself into a corner but Dallas was still holding on for dear life. Bill shut the door and he yelled, “*Hold on fer dear life, boy!*” Dallas hollered back, “Y*ep! Got a pretty good handle on that!*” His hands slipped and I could see his nails scrape up some tree bark, “*In theory!*”

Bill loosened his belt and space-walked himself back to the porch column, “*Hand me tha end of that hose, ‘Rito. Left tha ol’ lariat back in tha truck.*” Stiffly, I felt around and edged myself over until I gripped the hose. I shouted out, “*This ain’t no damn tornado!*”

I moved closer to Bill, “*Catch on three! One… two… three!*” And tossed the hose as hard as I could but the wind smacked it back to my face. Dallas still clung to the tree but he couldn’t for much longer.

I heard the clink of metal and a thud as Bill muttered, “*Modesty be damned, boys*!” I looked up and saw Bill’s pants on the floor. I damn near thought he had gone commando with how white his legs were against his tighty whities.

He looped his belt around and offered his hand, and I knew what I needed to do. I yelled again, “*One… two… three!*” And tossed the hose back and Bill managed to loop his belt around it.

Bill led the charge down the steps as I lifted and we rushed against the screaming wind. Dallas’ sweaty hands slipped just as we arrived and he shouted a shrill scream. Bill didn’t even think, he threw himself and anchored himself to his nephew. I shimmied down the hose and added my weight, too.

Then the wind stopped and it was light again. The smell started to fade away. We stared at each other in awe. 

We took in Dallas’ wind-chapped lips, my blistered hands, and Bill’s…mostly bare bottom. Bill lifted his pants back up and gestured for his belt back. Dallas unbuckled the belt from the hose and passed it to his uncle, murmuring, “*Thanks Unc… Pac.*”

We looked at the ground as Bill made himself decent. Then he tipped his hat and said, “*We will never speak of this incident agin. You boys awright?*” We nodded, eager to forget what we had seen, “*Yessir.*”

Then the walkie-talkie blipped. Emily’s panicked voice came through, “*Uh, hoss….you need to come down to the stables right now. Something awful happened!*” I heard folks hollering in the background.

Bill looked up and shouted at the house, “*Y’all alright dear!?*” Juan responded, *“Yes, we’ll be alright for now. I got Tomás so don’t worry, jefazo (boss).*”

We hopped back in Bill’s truck and gassed it to the stables. When we got out, that’s when we knew Dallas couldn’t have had anything to do with that rattlesnake.

The stench of death permeated almost every stall, even worse than what we smelled before. Black, putrid blood and bile spilled out onto the sawdust. Nearly every damn horse was swollen up like a balloon.

Emily pointed at Phil on the floor with a group of others as we walked over, “*Here.*” 

Phil clutched a crimson-stained towel in his gloved arms. He peeled back the cloth to reveal a dead-eyed foal, bloated like it had been rotten for weeks. Phil shook his head and said, “*This ain’t no encephalitis.*” Then he looked up at the ceiling and said to no one in particular, “*What the hell could a’ done this?*”

Bill sucked his teeth. Then he told us to send out any survivors to the pasture with blankets and some ear protection.

I checked and saw that Nutmeg made it. She was whinnying in panic and I don’t blame her, I looked down to see black liquid spilling out of her. Dallas put his hands up real gentle-like and spoke softly to her, “*Hey, girl it’s okay. I got you.*” 

She calmed down when I moved in front of her and called Phil over. I think I didn’t visit Corazón’s stall first because I was afraid of what I would see.

But I was right to be afraid.

Across from Nutmeg’s stall, Corazóns body lay bloated on the ground. I rushed up and called for Phil’s help but I knew from the black blood and milky-white eyes that my girl was gone. I had to break away.

We gathered about an hour later and Bill drew on the stable wall with Phil’s pencil, “*Thirteen horses left.*” I looked him in the eye and said, “*I think it’s time we tell them what happened.*”

Dallas spoke up, “*And I ain’t have nothing to do with it, y’all.*” I nod, “*Yeah, this ain’t one of Dallas’ fuckups for once.*” Dallas opened his mouth to protest but Bill put a hand up, “*You know damn well he right.*” Dallas crossed his arms across his chest but said nothing more.

Bill tried the walkie-talkie, “We’re finna come back in so errybody can catch up.”

Folks gathered in the Harthwright’s house, shaken up and covered in filth. Phil was on the porch trying to talk to someone about an “Aviary issue,” but the call kept dropping. He went off for a little bit before everyone got into the house. Probably needed to get clearer reception. Phone signals and the internet never work great on a farm, but even this was unusual today.Tomás is wrapped tight across Juan’s chest with a cloth and a giant pair of headphones strapped to his ears. Everyone gathered around the dining table as we talked about the horses.

Juan’s jaw dropped for a second before he composed himself.

Then we told them about the bloated snake, the rotten grass, and the dust. When I brought up that it was a rattlesnake, Dallas asked, “*How the hell do you know it’s not a gopher snake? I was right up on it and I ain’t see that!*”

I looked at him, “*Well, yeah. You were too busy tryna’ cause trouble. But I looked at its tail and saw a little baby rattle on the tip. It’s a juvenile.*”

There was silence then Phil piped up, “*Every horse we have left is between four to fifteen-years old. No foals, no yearlings, none. If whatever this is going from reptiles to horses…what’s next? Us?*”

Juan’s body stiffened upon hearing the age of the animals that died, and he looked down at Tomás. He stood up and commanded us, “*Everybody, stay inside, call your families, and board up the windows. If it’s a twister, we can’t be outside right now.*”",1,1733089067.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1h4ea8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1h4ea8w/when_will_i_get_smaller/,When will I get smaller,"5’8 female. Been stuck around 170 for 4 years. Last time I lost weight I was eating 1300 calories a day and it took me 8 weeks to get down to 162. Anything over 1300 and I don’t see weight come off. 

I’m generally on a “keto” style diet just because it suppresses my appetite, but I’ll still eat healthy carbs. I weight train 2x a week and I take walks regularly, and I get about 5000 steps a day at my job. 

Typical day as of late:
Coffee and turkey sausage for breakfast 

Leftover meat (two fist size) and some fruit for lunch 

Strip steak and roasted vegetables for dinner 

Maybe a small cup of ice cream for dessert. 


Lately I’ve been getting even more restrictive and am even considering an extreme Matthew mcconaughey Dallas buyers club diet to speed things up. 

I do enjoy fasting for 48 hours or so when I feel my body is up for it. 

My question is: when will I actually get smaller? It took me 2 months to lose 8 lbs when on 1300 calories. 

I’m 36. Is this really what being an aging female is like? ",0,1733089050.0,loseit,5,0.5,False
1h4ea21,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDD/comments/1h4ea21/overeating_and_bloating/,Overeating and bloating!!,"Please advice. He/him

Before I continue writing, I would like to mention that I already eat a healthy diet, including high protein, fibre, vegetables, fruit, I avoid gluten, dairy and sugar. I am very active, I run and walk, I do calisthenics,  i do morning/evening home workouts. It seems that every luteal phase I am unable to stick to my calorie limit and I just overeat.  This week I broke my habits of avoiding sugar and gluten which has been a while since I've done that and last time I made that mistake my pmdd symptoms worsened compared to other times where I sticked to my food options. Its just every time luteal phase hits its harder to stick to it. I still eat healthy but above the calorie limit and with that I would eat some gluten, something with sugar like chocolate and each time it ends up in a disaster and become a monster.
Recently I came back to drinking black coffee (I stopped because of PMDD) and it seems to help surpress my appetite sometimes but I don't know how I will react once shark week comes even closer.
The overeating causes more bloating and its so uncomfortable. Its so difficult to deal with the anger outburts, mood swings, emotional dysregulation and physical sypmtoms while bloated AND overeating. All that seems to make the experience worse. the uncomfortability and how I react to it messes with my life, relationships and mental health. I am already working on emotional regulating and the mental health stuff but I must elimante the overeating and bloating as it only makes it more difficult to deal with everything.

 Please don't say that I should allow myself to eat whatever I want and how much and that I should give myself a break etc.. there is a reason why I choose this lifestyle. It improved my quality of life and PMDD symptoms. 

If anyone has any tips to avoid overeating during luteal phase and how to stop the bloating/make it better I'd appreciate it",1,1733089037.0,PMDD,5,1.0,False

1h4e7pm,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1h4e7pm/i_think_my_coworker_is_flirting_with_me_and/,I think my coworker is flirting with me?? And closeted?! ,"This will be a looong post. Please bear with me here. 
Coworker is 35f and I'm 25f. She knows im an out lesbian. I genuinely think she is a confused closeted lesbian who may not even know that herself. 

For 3 years we've had flirty banter that has gotten stronger and stronger from the day we met. 
I've asked to see her outside of work over the years but as she has 2 young kids she's never been able to. Her kids are her world and she doesn't really share them with anyone. There is one other colleague she introduced her kids to but that's because they attend the same swimming class. 

She has a boyfriend. (Yes. I KNOW) she talks about him a lot of how he makes her sad, and how she feels like she should 'Just stay with him' because she's had 2 kids. She says she 'Wonders what she did wrong to choose him' and is always saying shes the 'man of the house' etc. She's described them as roommates/ housemates before. It's not in the normal straight girl ranting about her boyfriend way, and more in a genuinely her relationship makes her sad kind of way. 

At work we find any stupid excuse to see eachother. If one is at the coffee machine the other will run over to snatch a 5 second convo. She'll tease me, bully me (playfully)  call me a nickname i hate. We lock eyes and smirk across the corridors for 10 whole seconds until the other is out of sight. She'll always catch my eye, even if I'm in a conversation with someone we find a way to make the other look. I work in a hotel. She will check the clean rooms and I'll text her to ask where she is, and instead of a generic floor (Which is what she tells all my other colleagues) she texts me the EXACT NUMBER of the room she is in so we can 'check rooms' together which means flirt and chat whilst pretending to do the job. Our other colleagues tease us and tell us to just get a room already etc. 

Shes shy and English is not her first language  (she's like 80 percent fluent) we became good friends fast and have coffee every morning in her office. We will say the same thing at the same time. I tell her she's pretty or i like her hair and she grins at me. She calls me a nickname I hate, when something goes wrong she will (jokingly) tell everyone its my fault and grin. She comes to find me to tell stuff, we take our breaks together and she remembers how I like my coffee. She makes a joke that I'm 'Her English' and that im also her 'Private Teacher' once she asked me to help her check an email she sent, but got me to 'double check' she 'spelt her own name correctly' which... Was a little odd and makes me think she's flirting as she's always doing ridiculous stuff like that with a sly grin.

 I've met her kids once, she took pics and videos of us together at her house as she invited me over as i was in the area waiting in the rain for the bus and she drove me home instead. She confided in me that she's scared they won't learn English well and sent me a pic of their report cards. I gave some advice and tried to calm her down. That was months ago.

We have an inside joke that i don't like blondes (shes a brunette) and that she doesn't like shorties (im short) and we will bring this up from time to time. She teases me for being short, and I'll always tease her for random stuff. If she wants something basic like even a sheet of paper I won't give it to her unless she 'Asks' me 'nicely' and she bats her eyelashes and goes 'Pleeeeeaaase' its our little game. 

Sometimes she will send me random selfies or give me updates about her day and text. She hates texting. 

She never wants to do anything outside of work because shes so busy with her kids  and she's shy. However this week has been weird. Its like something changed in her. She invited me out with her kids after work. So after spending 8 hours together she invited me to spend time with just her and her 4 year old who she's told all about me (I only met him the once)  this happened 3 days in a row, each time at the end of our shift. We went around the christmas market and she told her kid to go on one of the rides with me instead of her. She was taking pictures and videos the whole time and i took pics of her from our perspective. Then we went to the bar and she bought me and her a beer. I joked I've been trying to buy her a drink for 3 years and finally its happened. 
I sat on the opposite side leaving space the other side of the bench so she and her kid could sit down but instead she sat right next to me and we drank our beer we cheersed and took selfies with all of us in. She kept reminding her kid that i was there and that i was nice etc. 

The next day, same thing. We went to a cafe and she bought me a hot chocolate. But she batted her eyelashes and begged me to order for her because im 'English' and she said 'Pleeeeease' like we do at work so i could ask for cream and marshmallows. she let me take pics of her all happy with her hot chocolate. She teased me saying i melted all the marshmallows in her hot chocolate on purpose etc. She took lots of pics of me and her kid again. 

I noticed she sent the pics to someone and she told me she was sending pics of me and the kid to her family group chat and that they knew about me from the time i came over in the rain. Her family don't live here so it makes sense she'd have a chat but i didn't know they knew about me existing. She then also invited HERSELF over to my house when her kid said he wanted to meet my dog. I thought she was joking as she said 'Oh we' ll go tommorow' in the way you tell little kids stuff so they'll stop annoying you kind of thing. BUT SHE MEANT IT. 

the next day she waited for me with her kid again, and drove me to my house. While she was parking she said it wasn't 'Straight' and i make a joke saying 'Well, not everything here is either' and she flashed me a grin, and rolled her eyes and muttered my nickname whilst smiling telling me to shut up. She joked her English is getting goood because she's spending soooo much time with me and that no one has to know we're spending so much time together. 

I have deep red hair and she showed me her Christmas nails, which are (as she pointed out) the same colour as my hair. She also wore a shirt that day which was the same colour as well and got so excited when a colleague said we matched. 

She's joked that she knows where i used to live, and she also took a picture of my perfume so she could buy it herself. 
After her maternity leave last year her forst day back she demanded our colleagues take a photoshoot of us back together. 

Sorry it was sooo long. I just think its a bit odd as she doesn't introduce her kids to people and is very protective of them. I also am just a coworker who doesn't have any reason to interact with her kids (Like the other colleague who has a kid who swims) and i only met him the one time but he knows all about me. 

I think i really like her but she has a boyfriend and kids, and shes my colleage but i don't know what to do now. It feels like she's making me a part of her kids lives and her flirting is so weird?? I really think she's questioning and don't know what to do. Please no comments saying don't date your colleague, i know.

To fill up the ever-increasing time gap in my CV, I decided to (kind of) write in my CV that I attend AA meetings as the meeting organiser. Of course, as y'all know, hell nah I would straight up say I visit AA and am an alcoholic, recovering or whatever! 

In this world and society, we chug down our feelings every night after a tough work day, and never dare seek help - like real men! Hooah! (sarcasm)

But I go to AA selfishly for myself. I love when other people come, I love entertaining them. Even as the organiser and coffee-brewer and book-reader, I would not mind if I happen to be alone in a meeting.

Here’s what you need to know about “John” and me.

We have been together since we were 15. We got engaged at 18, the summer before we went to different colleges. We were both 20. Our wedding date was eight months away. 

He was my dad’s best friend. They went hunting and fishing together all the time, and it was heartwarming to see them spend so much time together.

My dad went through a divorce before he met my mom. They married, and six months later, his then-wife ran off with another man.

We had a serious conversation one day about my future. We had been together long enough that our families assumed we’d be together forever.

“Do you love him?”

He needed to know I truly loved him and wasn’t staying with him just for our families. He didn’t want me to go through what he did before he met my mom.

“If you marry the wrong person, It could really mess up your life.”

“Yes, I love him more than anything.” 

I was positive. John and I were made for each other.

We couldn’t wait to move in with each other and call our own shots. We hated being kids; we both wished we were older. I was so excited to finally move in with him and start living the life we both dreamed of together. I had so much money in savings for our future together. I got my first job at 16 and saved nearly every dollar I made. I volunteered at the local animal rescue, and the rescue was kind enough to hold my favorite dog for several months so we could adopt him at the end of the year.

It was the weekend before my finals week. I was in my next-to-last semester for my four-year degree. And the weekend he graduated. That Saturday, he got handed his diploma for his two-year degree. Watching him walk across the stage in his cap and gown was a dream come true. He made it. One of us made it over our finish line, and he even started his new job that Monday. It couldn’t have been more perfect.

Our plan was to move to Bluefield together, but I would stay with my parents on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. I scheduled my classes, so I’d only have to spend three nights away from him each week. Since I only had one more semester, it was doable until I got my degree.

He got upset about nearly everything I did. Since we were moving in together soon, I knew I had to stand my ground with him more often not let him push me around as much. I was gradually growing a stronger backbone.
We were both lying in bed that evening.

We were discussing how we might arrange our new apartment. I noticed John was quiet and seemed uninterested, so I asked him what was wrong.

He looked straight forward and said, “I don’t think I’m happy anymore.”

It took me a few moments to process what he just said.
“What? What’s going on, what’s wrong?” 

I got responses like,” I don’t know I’m just unhappy. I’ve felt this way for a while. I don’t know what it is.” 

I asked if it’s because he’s unsure about his new job. I asked if it was because he feared moving several hours away from our families. I asked if it was because he’s sad he’s leaving a bunch of his friends now that he’s graduated. Though I doubted it, I even asked if there was someone else that he might love. No. The answer to anything and everything I asked it could be was no. 
Then I finally asked, “…Is it me?” 

He paused and said, ""I don’t know again."" My heart skipped a beat. We were getting married in eight months… and I may have just somehow ruined everything.

I started asking the usual questions that I’m used to asking since he couldn’t come up with an answer. 

What am I doing wrong?
Did I do something today? 

He couldn’t give me a reason. 
Did I say something you didn’t like? 
Well, lately, yeah, you’ve been doing that a lot. 
This is kind of what he just went with going forward. He said I don’t always praise him like I did when we were younger. He said lately I’ve been really mean to him. 
After this, I spent the next several hours professing my undying love to him. 

“There’s no one I love and respect more than you. I’m so sorry for making you feel unworthy in any way. What do I need to do? What do you want me to change? What will it take for me to make you happy again?”
“I mean… I want to marry you.” 

I was so emotional and confused. I didn’t know what I was doing wrong, and John wasn’t telling me how to improve my actions. I didn’t know what to do.

He reassured me that he was too unsure to make a decision about whether to end our engagement and told me that I had nothing to worry about. 

I think it’s needless to say how I took this. It made me want to die.

Sunday,
I called him early in the morning because I needed to hear his voice. My phone call woke him up. I didn’t even know what to say to him when I had him on the phone. He was irritated by the whole phone call. He told me I needed to speak up and try to breathe because he couldn’t understand what I was telling him. 

“Okay, sorry”

“What’s wrong? Are you alright?”

“...No.” (Why in the world would I be okay after last night??)

He says nothing, so I say 

“I need to know you're okay. I need to know that I have nothing to worry about.”

“Sigh”

“Should I be worried?!”

He groaned when he said, “I don’t know.”

I fell on my bed, crying harder than I had ever cried in my life. I grabbed my pillow and started screaming into it and punching it.

I picked up the phone, and he asked if I wanted him to stop by before leaving for Bluefield. I said yes.

I hoped he would get here and hug me harder than he ever had, tell me he was sorry and that I had nothing to worry about and tell me how much he loved me. I needed to hear it. I had never been more scared in my life.
When he got there, we went to my bedroom. We sat on the bed together, and he just looked at me. His face said, “I’m here, what do you want?” I felt like I didn't even know him. He looked so aggravated. He looked at me like I was someone he’d never cared for, like someone he couldn’t stand. Just looking at him made me break down in tears. 

He angrily asked, “What will it take to make this better?”
This angered me. He was acting like he had no idea what was bothering me. 

I said, “Well, obviously, I would feel a lot better if you stopped acting like you suddenly don’t love me and promised me that I have nothing to worry about.”
This had him completely appalled.

“I’m not promising you anything”

I felt like I was going to black out. I just laid down on my bed. He just kept sitting there letting me cry. He probably got his phone out and started playing on it while I was like this.

After some more time passed, he told me he was ready to leave. I usually hug him, kiss him and send him out the front door. But whenever he made me cry, I would always prefer to stay in my room until I could pull myself together. I didn’t want my parents to think that he upset me. I told him to just go.

“Well, do I at least get a kiss?” 

I pushed myself off the bed and kissed him. As he left, I asked, “What do I tell your mom if she wants to go wedding dress shopping? What am I supposed to tell everyone when they see me crying?” 

“I don’t know…. I love you.”

“...I love you too.” 

I was pissed that he just danced around that question. But I always had to respond when he said I love you, or he’d get mad. And I was just so tired from crying to stop him and get an honest answer.

I stayed in my room and cried for several more hours. I was furious because he dropped this bomb on me right before my finals week. Why couldn’t he at least have waited till next weekend to tell me this so I could focus on finals? I was full of guilt for being mad at him. It obviously must be really bothering him for him to be bringing this up at a time like this. I beat myself up for having an attitude with him earlier when he asked me how he could make it better. That was really considerate of him, and all I did was snap at him. Why can’t I just make him happy? This was my fault. If I had just been better, he wouldn’t have ever brought this up. I need to be brave for him, and get through all the problems I’ve brought upon myself. I needed to show him I could be strong, handle conflict, and be his peace and comfort. 
He texted me when he got to his hotel in Bluefield. I asked him, “Do you want me to leave you alone for a while?” I could tell he was annoyed that I kept bringing this up. “Yeah, I just need time to think about what I want.”

“Okay, I love you so much, and I’m here when you’re ready to talk.”

It killed me not knowing when he’d ever text me back. But I knew all I was doing was making things worse, and me not bothering him was the best thing I could do.
It hurt to breathe. My face had no color. I checked my phone constantly to see if John texted me. I wanted him to call me and tell me he loved me and that everything was okay. 

I knew I couldn’t hide my emotions from my parents, so I approached my mom about it. I told her that he was confused and just scared of how everything is changing. He just graduated and is now moving across the state to start his new job. I said that I took it the wrong way, that I thought he was unsure of me too and that I simply overreacted. She hugged me and told me everything will work out and that we’ll both be fine.

I spent the rest of the day away from my family because I was crying on and off. I will never forget how I felt. The hours felt like years.. I could hear my heartbeat in my chest, and it was so loud that my ears were ringing. I couldn’t see straight, I couldn’t get air to get in and out of my lungs properly. It felt like my neck and chest were wrapped in barbed wire and the more I would breathe, the more I hurt.  I had to hold onto the wall when I stood up to walk because I was shaking and trembling so hard. The pain I felt hurt so bad that I wanted to die.

It felt like years. It was the worst night of my life. Just this simple Sunday and Monday felt like it lasted longer than my whole twenty years of life. It suddenly makes a lot of sense that people commit suicide when they have this much emotional pain. I was afraid that I was losing this war against my emotions. How much longer can I fight this?

I had all three of my finals on Monday. 

I went to the library to do some last-minute studying. It turned out that changing my surroundings didn’t help. I was holding my chest because of the pain. I was crying all day. I was breathing so loud and hard that I was wheezing. I noticed people around me were noticing. I tried to keep my hand off my chest so no one would think that I was struggling to breathe. A few people asked me if I was okay. When I replied yes, they could probably tell that I had been crying.  I was so embarrassed by all the looks I was getting. I realized how NOT okay I was. My professors, my peers, and everyone I walked past noticed me. This pain, guilt, and fear had completely consumed me. There was no putting on a brave face.

After I bombed my last final, I trembled back to my car. I was struggling to catch my breath from the short but painful and exhausting walk all the way there. Once I made it, I had to strenuously catch my breath, then sit and cry one more time before I started driving, and then catch my breath again.

When I was making my commute back home, I dove deep into thought. 

He was the one that made me feel this way. 
He was also the only one who could make me feel better. 

His actions and words have so much power over me.. And he knows it.

I don’t like that someone has this kind of control over me.

The thought of marrying him and being with him for the rest of my life seemed terrifying to me now. 
I felt so much guilt for still being angry at him. He told me not to worry about it. That’s supposed to be enough. I need to drop it. I’m being dramatic.
Deep in my mind, I was screaming to myself: You can’t live like this!! The pain I felt hurt so bad that I wanted to die. And marrying him might make me have to endure this pain forever. Even if he called me and said, “I still love you, and I still want to marry you, "" I knew it wouldn’t fix it. What if he starts feeling unsure again? All he’d have to do is say it, and I’d go right back to rock bottom where I am now. I knew I could never forgive him for making me feel so small and worthless. Can I really marry him now?
But I didn’t dive too deep into this thought. I kept stopping myself. I kept reassuring myself that I love him and he loves me, he’s just confused. This has only been bothering me for… two days? (How has it been only two days? It feels like it's been a lifetime.) I’m really getting bad about taking things too hard.  I should be ashamed of myself for making this about me, instead of doing everything I can to comfort him right now. I’m being weak. What good am I if I can’t make his hurt go away?
He texted me and asked if we could talk on the phone. 
I was so excited to hear his voice, but at the same time, I was dreading hearing his voice. I was afraid of what he had to say; I didn’t know how many more times I could take being stabbed in the heart.
Here’s how the phone call went, to the best of my memory.
“Hey”
“Hey, Hun!”
“I got a place; it’s a house.”
“...Okay”
Pause
“It doesn’t allow dogs.”
“...Okay” 
Pause. My heart is sinking.
“I can’t do this anymore.”
Pause (Did I just hear that right? What do I say?)
“...woooow”
I’m unsure how long this pause lasted, whether a few seconds or several minutes.
I felt like my life flashed before my eyes. I couldn’t feel my body. I looked at his senior pictures of me and him up on my parents' wall. This is really the end. I thought about our dog, his family, my mom, dad, brother, and sister. I felt my face wet with tears, so I wiped my face. It was the millionth time I've had to wipe my face in the last two days, and I was fed up with it. I snapped.
“HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?? YOU RUINED MY LIFE!!”
I didn’t know what to do, so I just hung up and fell onto the couch, screaming. I wasn’t crying, I was screaming. I screamed till I couldn't anymore and started taking deep breaths. 
I noticed almost immediately that it felt easier to breathe. It felt like my lungs and throat weren’t wrapped in barbed wire anymore. It was like John had finally stopped violently strangling me. I felt hungry. I don’t remember the last time I ate. More than a day ago. I went to the kitchen and started eating some fruit and pretzels. I felt strength slowly filling my body. It was like I was revived after dying.
He texted me that we still need to get our stuff back to each other. He had things like my TV in his grandma's cabin and some of my nicer clothes. I had his parent’s wheelbarrow and other farm equipment at my house. I told him to leave me alone, and that I’ll talk to his mom. I assumed he wasn’t planning on telling her what he had done tonight.
I was home alone. My mom and dad had gone grocery shopping together. I called my mom and asked if they could both come home because I needed them.
“Can you come home? John just broke up with me.” 
“Okay, we’ll leave here now.”
I could tell she didn’t know how to react. How was she supposed to?
My eyes were so tired and hurting from crying so I turned off the living room light, then every light in the house. Then I just lay in the dark living room waiting for Mom and dad to get home.
My mom came through the front door and turned on the light. She didn’t see me on the couch. She looked panicked as she went into the other rooms and turned the lights on. I told her I'm here on the couch.
She sat down beside me and hugged me. My dad brought in the one bag of groceries they were able to get before I called them. He watched us talk for a little bit then walked into his room, probably thinking I wanted to talk to mom in private. My heart hurt for him. I felt like I had let him down. 
“I’m so mad at him.”
“I know I am too.”
She didn’t know what to say. What was she supposed to say?
“What am I going to do?”
“His family isn’t my family anymore.”
“I don’t know what happened.”
“I don’t know what I did.”
“I can’t go on the band trip to Albuquerque in a few days.”
She told me no, that I needed to go on it. She asked me if I think he cheated on me. I told her no, as mad at him as I was, I knew he would never cheat. I took a shower and went to bed. I lay there deep in thought. He finally realized I was not a good girlfriend, fiance, or wife. It just took him five years, four months and eight days to realize it. He just stayed with me so long because he pitied me and knew no one else would want to be with me. He didn’t want me to be lonely, but he didn’t quite love me enough to marry me. I guess I should be thankful that he put up with me all through high school and college.
I had the deepest, soundest sleep of my life that night. I had never woken up so rested yet depressed. I got out of bed and took off my engagement ring, then started gathering his stuff. I also started packing for my band trip to Albuquerque. 
I remember I went places with my mom. 
She told me I was handling this surprisingly well. I told her it was because I hadn't completely processed what happened.
She asked me if I felt suicidal. I told her no, that's never been an option for me,  and I'm feeling better than I was. She didn’t realize I meant better than before John broke up with me. 
I couldn’t believe that killing myself seemed like a good idea yesterday. How could feelings be so dangerous? How much longer would it have been until it affected my actions? Would I still be here if he never called me last night?
My parents were both furious at the whole situation. They were mad at John. My dad started going through every female on his Facebook friends list. I didn’t understand why; I knew he was wasting his time. This was all my fault. They should be mad at me. They should resent me for not being able to keep him happy. I had one job and I blew it, and now my whole family has to suffer because of me. I was so ashamed. 
I went on the Albuquerque trip. 
John’s friend, who would be his best man, was going too. I avoided him the entire trip because I didn’t want to be the bearer of bad news. I was just numb the whole trip, I didn’t interact much with anyone. This trip is the last marching band event I will ever go on. After marching all through high school and college, this is it. He didn’t like my high school friends, so I slowly pushed them away. And I had been distant with everyone in college because of him. It was always easier to keep him happy if I didn't have close friends. My life is empty now, and it’s all my fault. I was contemplating reaching out to him and apologizing. Apologize for not being who he needed to be, and thank him for loving me anyway. And I'm still trying to figure out what went wrong. I’m so stupid. No wonder he doesn’t want to marry me; I’m too stupid to know when I’ve fucked up. I think I may have lied to my mom about not feeling suicidal.
My mom picked me up after the trip.
She told me they didn't know all the details, but she and my dad had discovered John had been with someone else. She was afraid of how I would take it. 
I was shocked, but I didn't take it hard. It was actually the biggest relief I have ever had. I don’t have to blame myself for everything now, It turns out this is on him too.
A huge weight had just been lifted off my shoulders, but it just got replaced with anger.
He cheated on me. He made me believe that I was the reason he was leaving. When in reality, he saw more potential in someone else. How could he do this to me? 
My mom and dad asked me who I thought it could be. I told them I wasn’t sure; he had a lot of friends that were girls. Most of them are in relationships, though. I mentioned that he told me several months ago he thinks the Junior firefighter girl had a crush on him. He also told me on our way home from his graduation that he had a dream about him and her responding to a structure fire call together. I thought this wasn’t possible; a junior firefighter would still be in high school.
My parents encouraged me to buy myself a brand-new car. 
I was driving a 1998 Toyota Camry. They were driving me around to different dealerships while I was lying in the back seat. They were both trying so hard to lift my spirits. It hurt knowing how worried they were about me.
I traded my Camry in for a brand new 2018 Jeep Compass. This was the first time I had ever splurged on myself. 
My cousin was going through a divorce. 
She had been with her husband for as long as I had been with John. It really brought us together since our relationships both ended at the same time, under the same circumstances. So we went on a beach trip together. It felt good to spoil myself and vent to each other about our problems for a week.
When I returned, my dad told me they had found out who he was with. It was, in fact, the junior firefighter.
Knowing the other girl's identity didn’t change how I felt. I just thought, ""Good for them, how convenient."" 
I had to get a hold of his mom to exchange each other's stuff.
I asked his mom, “Have you met his new girlfriend?”
“No”
“He did tell you he was with someone else, right?”
“No, he promised us he didn’t.”
I then sent her some screenshots and told her, “I’m sorry, he's lying to you.”
I met his mom a few days later to exchange each other's stuff. I didn’t give the engagement ring back. I asked, ""Are you happy for him?” 
She responded, “Well, we’re happy he’s happy.” I could tell she was embarrassed.
After this, the fury of betrayal started kicking in.
I had several meltdowns. I was screaming. I was throwing stuff across the room. I pulled my hair so hard that I noticed I was pulling it out. I was scared of what I was turning into. I felt like a monster.
He made sure he was in an unknown location before he made the last phone call he'd ever make to me. He didn’t have it in him to do it in person. He was afraid of what I’d do to him, what my dad would do to him. He didn’t have the nerve to face anyone. He just ran and hid.
He lied to his parents about being with someone else. He didn’t care what his parents thought of me. He wanted them to believe he left me simply because I made him miserable, and he was better off alone. Meanwhile, I lied to my parents to protect him. I wanted them to think highly of him, like I did. He lied to his parents to protect himself. He wanted everyone to blame me. I lied for him, and he lied for himself.
How long had he been with her?

Why did he put me through this? You knew I was strong and could put on a brave face when needed. But why were you trying to push me over the edge?

Why did he make me swallow every last bit of pride I had and beg for him when his mind was already made up?
Did you get some kind of sick thrill making me cry and beg for you? Did it feel good when you were kicking me while I was down?

Why couldn’t he just tell me that he cheated and end our engagement with some dignity Instead of torturing me in hopes I would snap and break up with him?
If it were the other way around, I would tell him what I had done. I would’ve told him he shouldn’t forgive me and that our engagement needs to end because you deserve better than to be with a cheater, even if that cheater is me.

Why couldn’t he have done it that way?

Did you want me to kill myself? Were you seriously okay with your fiance committing suicide to keep things easier for yourself? What did my family ever do to you!? How could you be okay with ending my life and putting everyone I loved through that?

Were you trying to start a fight when you told me you didn’t think that you were happy anymore? Were you hoping I’d break it off with you that night? Did you get nervous when I begged for you instead? You must’ve broke it off with me because you were afraid of getting caught, or worse. Maybe I would kill myself AFTER you left me? You couldn’t risk my suicide being after everyone knew you left me. 

You must’ve thought, “Oh no, it’s not working; the best thing I can do for myself now is try to let her down easily.”

You wanted me to kill myself so you could be the grieving boyfriend. You’d rather me be dead so you’d have no enemies. You must’ve loved the idea of my whole family comforting you and apologizing for my selfish actions. You knew them well enough to know they would still love you and consider you family; they’d probably encourage you to move on and find someone new. That way, you could act like your relationship with her started shortly after you and my devastated family buried me. How convenient.

This is a level of selfishness I never thought could exist.
Maybe I’m just crazy and blowing it out of proportion. But you can’t tell me that your intentions were never to hurt me. You saw how badly I was hurting. You saw my lifeless face. You knew that I was feeling suicidal. Yet you did nothing. How could you say that you loved me? You were killing me. I was dying. And you just saw it as an imposition. I was an obstacle that needed to be disposed of. 

I fought for you. I protected you. I bent over backward to make you happy. Your being happy meant the world to me. There was nothing I wanted more. I wanted happiness more for you than I wanted it for myself. I reinvented myself a million times with the hopes that at least one of the versions of me would make you feel complete. And all you did was chew it all up and spit it in my face while I lie on the ground bleeding out BECAUSE OF YOU.

You knew I could handle it. You knew I was strong. You knew how badly I wanted you to be happy. That’s why you did it. You know how I always make the best of every situation. You knew that me telling the world about your dirty laundry wouldn’t make me feel better. 

You knew I would keep it to myself. You knew that I would not seek revenge because I finally got what I wanted: your happiness. You knew I would simply wish you the best because when I love someone, I give them my whole heart. And you still had it.

I can’t believe he didn’t care about how this would eat away at my soul.
I gave him the most important years of my life. 



I started moving on with my life. 

I started my last semester at school. I got a job at Tudors. I had no one to talk to. I had never felt so lonely.

I was juggling denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance faster than I could keep up. I was trying to remember things that had happened in the following months. What happened was like a severe accident that messed with my memory. I was still trying to process everything. 

At school, a lot of guys talked to me more. They were really friendly and would try to get to know me. I was confused about this at first, but I realized it had to be because I was no longer wearing a ring. Around the same time, guys from my area tried to befriend me and ask if I was single on Facebook. I wasn’t sure how to take this at first. 

I don’t know how to do this. I don’t know how to date people. Why are they interested in me? You realize I’m a freak, right? Why do you think I keep to myself? Why do you think I have no friends? No one wants me. You shouldn’t want me either.

After ensuring they weren’t just looking for a hookup, I agreed to go out for coffee or dinner with a few. I told them I wasn’t ready to be in a serious relationship because I just got out of one. I was carrying a lot of emotional baggage, and I didn’t want to burden anyone with it. It was nice talking to someone about what I had been through in the past months. But I think I overwhelmed several of them with it all; I never heard from many of them again. 

I didn’t know what my standards were or what I was looking for in a partner. I just need to stay single until I’ve figured it out and am a little more emotionally stable. I don’t know how to date people anyway.
It’s the middle of March now, about three months later.
I enjoyed doing whatever I wanted with my money. My sister and I started planning a two-week road trip as a graduation present to myself. 

I planned a date with a guy named Mason, who went to Hurricane High School and was class of 2013, just two years before me. He was a big gamer. We discussed the games we’ve both played. He was familiar with all the games I talked about. He made me blush, smile, and laugh so much when we talked. He drove an orange Camaro; I was excited to go for a ride in it.

He picked me up, and we went to dinner. I gave him the whole rundown of events that had happened in the last three months. Once I got through everything on the list, he said that it all sounded so rough and that he was sorry that that all happened to me. He still seemed just as interested in me. It didn’t seem to bother him that I was still not over what happened to me. We drove down several backroads for hours after dinner so we could talk longer.

He was really fun to talk to. He had a playlist made just for our time in the car together. Pop/Punk, Boybands, all songs singing about a special girl in their life. He made me smile so much and I felt so comfortable around him. When he took me back to my car after our date, I really didn’t want to leave him. I wanted to see him again.
“Will I see you again?”

He said, “We’ll see,” with a smile.

I got into my car and drove home. I started overthinking how he said, “We’ll see” instead of, “Yes, I want to see you again.”

He didn’t message me that night. 

Morning came, and I went to work. He still hasn’t messaged me. I started tearing up while cleaning the dining room. I scared him off. He probably couldn’t wait to get me back to my car so he could get rid of me. I’m so stupid. I tried to convince myself that it was okay; I didn’t really like him that much anyway.

He messaged me and told me good morning. I was so relieved. I told him I was afraid you wouldn’t talk to me anymore.

“You don’t have to worry about that with me.”
He asked me if I wanted to go out again. I was so happy.
He thought I was amazing. 

He thought every detail about me was so fascinating and perfect. When he drove, he always looked over at me. “I’m sorry, It’s hard to keep my eyes off of you” “I can’t believe I have a girl as pretty as you in my car.”
“I’m glad I found a girl who’s a nerd like me.” This made me think.. Yeah.. I guess I am a nerd. John didn’t care for any games I played. He just saw me gaming as something that takes my attention away from him. The fact that I didn’t have to be ashamed about gaming around him had me overjoyed. I could embrace it, I could be proud of it.

He gave me butterflies like crazy. Am I falling in love again? Or am I just confused? After several more dates, he hugged me, and I snuck in a kiss. 

“I was actually about to ask you if I could kiss you, but that answered my question.”

It's April now,

One day, when we were out together, he asked if I thought it was a good idea to make our relationship official finally.
I didn’t say anything. I just froze. It had only been about four months since John left me. It was really traumatic, and it still kept me up at night. I wasn’t sure if I was ready.
“Sooo…. No?”
“No! I'm not saying no! I just don’t think I’m ready.”
I told him I’d like to be single while I go on that road trip with my sister. 

We had it planned for the end of May. What I didn’t tell him is that I didn’t want to worry about keeping someone at home happy while I was busy trying to have fun. The whole purpose of the road trip was to make me feel free.

He didn’t mind at all. He told me to take my time and do what’s best for me. 

“I hope I can still kiss you, though!” This man really adores me...

That night I thought really hard about us. 

I knew I still wasn’t thinking straight from everything that had happened back in December. I thought about how broken I was and how much pain I was in. Mason has done nothing but bring me joy. He was comforting me and healing my hurt. He still wanted to hold my hand, kiss me, and show me off to his friends when I just told him I’m not willing to be his girlfriend… yet. It’s not fair to Mason. I shouldn’t use someone like this. I shouldn’t make him wait for me. What if I'm leading him on, and I decide later that I don’t want to be with him? I can’t hurt someone like that. I can’t do someone wrong who is nothing but kind and patient with me. I want what’s best for him. Should I let him go? No, I can’t let him go. No one has ever made me this happy. But I can’t string him along when I can’t promise him anything. 

I felt so selfish, and I didn’t know what to do… I really think I love him. Please stay. Please don’t go.

We went on several more dates, and he never brought up making our relationship official again. He really cared about me and wanted me to do whatever my heart wanted to do. It was such a selfless thing that I’d never thought someone would do for me. I really thought I didn’t deserve to be loved and cared for. Am I really worthy of all of this love and affection he was giving me infinite amounts of?

He got angry with me once in a conversation when I started getting insecure. “Why do you always put yourself down? How could someone like you hate yourself so much? You need to stop. It’s only human to make mistakes and no one is perfect. But you should know how smart and beautiful you are. I need you to know that. You need to take me seriously when I compliment you. I’m not just trying to flatter you; I really mean everything I say to you.”

I froze. I didn’t know how to respond to that. You’re supposed to be ashamed when someone reprimands you, but that was what he was reprimanding me for… I took a second to process what he said before I responded.

“You’re right. Thank you.”

“That’s better!”

I had been dreading disappointing him for the first time. I guess I was afraid he’d snap out of the daydream he’s in, see that I’m not perfect, get disgusted, and never talk to me again. But nothing prepared me for that. He didn’t just see me as the girl of his dreams; he also saw me as a person. He’s not just showering me with affection because he’s blindly in love. He was falling in love and could see perfectly.

When we’d game together, he made me laugh so hard because he’d praise every little thing I did.

I’m just walking around - “You’re so good at this game!”
I’d solve a puzzle - “You’re so smart!”
I’d kill an enemy - “That was so hot!”
“Stop it! I’m not even that far into the game!” 
“No, You’re good at this and need to know it!”
Mason’s friends liked me and told me I was so good to him.

“I have never seen Mason so happy. I’m so happy Mason found someone like you.”

I told my mom how he loved everything about me.
“That’s so amazing! You deserve someone who treats you like a princess! I’m so glad you found him; you deserve so much happiness.”

I never thought I’d hear someone say I deserve this.
We loved seeing each other smile. It was so rewarding for us to see each other happy. We never stopped trying to make it happen every day. It was like being high on love. I felt like I could fly.

And all at once, I didn’t care about being single on my road trip, I didn’t care about my past, I didn’t care about the possibility of hurting him because I never want to. I just want Mason.

It’s been long enough. This is real.

On April 12, 2018, I told him I’d like to be his girlfriend.
In November 2019, We bought our first home together.
On October 2, 2021, We got married.
On June 25, 2024, our son Rowan was born.

I have never been happier in my life. 
And it’s not because I found a better man, but because I’ve learned to love myself, Thanks to Mason. 

I believe now. I believe that I’m worth it. I believe that I’m important. I believe that I deserve to be loved. I deserve to be respected. I deserve peace and happiness. I’m smart. I have endless potential. My feelings matter. I recognize that I’m compassionate and considerate of everyone I love.  I am a good sister and a good daughter. I’m a good person. 

And I also think I believe in soul mates now.

I’m ashamed of how low I thought of myself.
I thought I was a bad person. I legitimately thought I was one of the worst people to ever exist. I thought everyone around me was better. Everyone else is smarter, friendlier, and more capable than I’ll ever be. I don’t deserve anything.

I’m scared of people now. 
After everything I’ve been through, I learned the hard way that I am a good person in a world of nasty people.
Everyone I meet, I think: Are you a monster too? Are you going to stab me in the back? Are you only being nice because you want something from me? What do you want from me? 

I’m afraid of getting too comfortable with people. I see the best in people, and that’s not a good thing.
I still struggle with my confidence. 

Am I doing the right thing? Did I say the right thing? Did I make that awkward? Did I offend them? 
My heart still hurts sometimes. 

I really do see what I went through as a traumatic accident, and the part of me that got injured didn’t heal properly and goes through routine pain from time to time.

Whenever I have disagreements with colleagues, am disrespected by clients, or argue with family, I take it all more personally, and it hurts more than it used to.
I can’t grasp that my life is real.

Even though I have my own house, am married, and have a son, I am still trying to process that this is real life and these events are really happening.

“I can’t believe we’re homeowners! I can’t believe we’re married! I can’t believe I’m pregnant! I can’t believe I’m a mother!”

I don’t say these things because it’s unbelievable, I say these things because it’s NOT believable. Ever since I heard the words “I don’t know if i’m happy anymore”, Something changed me. It’s like I’m frozen thinking “did I hear that right? Am I processing this right?”

John permanently changed me. And the “accident” crippled me for life.

Mason will never know who I was before it happened. It’s not fair that Mason gets the lesser version of me. He deserves the old me. Instead, he got someone who was scared of the world, goes through regular phases of depression, and is somewhat delusional because she isn’t completely in touch with reality.

I’m never going to get over it.
I was a child when I met John. I was so naive and vulnerable, I had a huge heart. I was a perfect victim for a narcissist. 

I never wonder about “what could’ve been” with John. I only wonder what could’ve been if I had never met him. If I would have more friends, If I would’ve experienced falling in love a hundred times as a teenager instead of just once. I’ll never stop wondering how much life I never got to live because of him. Those were my teenage years, and I will never get them back.

I will never stop feeling stupid for being with him when he didn’t deserve me. I was in control of my life, yet I stood by his side even though he bullied me, degraded me, and ridiculed me every chance he got. 

Yes, he cheated on me. That’s on him.
But I loved him unconditionally. And I tolerated him unconditionally. That will always be on me.

""Ah. Now *that* was a man who could talk.""

I turned around, interest piqued. ""Jesus? You met Jesus?""

""Yes. He was a kind man.""

""Jesus Christ of Nazareth? Really? You met him, for real?""

""Of Tiberius,"" he corrected me. ""I never spoke to the Christ one.""

I stopped and stared at him. He stared back blankly. ""... What?""

""Are you fucking with me on purpose?"" I asked.

I felt movement on my back, and could see Artemis lift her head from my peripheral vision. She yawned into my ear and rested her head back on my shoulder. I couldn't tell her eyes were open until she blinked.

""You finally awake?"" I asked.

After a moment of hesitation, she answered quietly, ""If I say yes, do I have to walk?""

I chuckled softly. ""No. You don't have to walk.""

She sighed happily and I could swear she got a little heavier. Then, suddenly, she thrashed off of my back like a startled feral cat and fell into the grass. I whirled around to see her get to a knee and materialize her bow in her hand. She looked around frantically and then locked eyes with me.

""The púca! Cara!"" she snarled. ""Where is she? What happened?""

""Whoa, whoa, whoa!"" I lifted my hands.

""Calm down, Artemis,"" Hypnos commanded. ""Save your savagery. The ordeal has concluded.""

She was breathing heavily, looking around the woods as though she were being stalked. I felt awful. I still didn't know what happened to her in the time we were separated.

""Are we out?"" she asked.

""We're out,"" I assured her, kneeling down and touching her arm. ""It's okay.""

""What happened?"" she asked urgently.

""Everything is all right,"" I said as gently as possible. ""I promise.""

""She did not *ask* if everything was all right,"" Hypnos said, folding his arms. ""She asked what *happened*. What happened was Sétanta, Buck's dream man, was not merely a figment of his imagination. Nay. He kidnapped all three of us with the aim of incapacitating *me*,"" he thumbed to himself. ""But he put this trickster god, Cara, in charge of the operation.""

She narrowed her eyes and dropped them to the ground. ""...Sétanta,"" she said under her breath.

There was recognition in her eyes.

""Cara wanted me dead for *reasons*,"" Hypnos looked at me sternly, ""and thought it would be fun to test Buck's powers against mine. Unfortunately for them, Buck has a good heart and a keen intellect. So, Cara intervened directly and attempted to execute me herself. Buck shot her with the rifle before she could deal the decisive blow!"" He smiled, ""T'was as if a playwright had penned the script!""

""Artemis,"" I cut in. ""You know Sétanta don't you? Why did you tell me you didn't?""

She looked up at me and was about to speak when Hypnos continued in epic fashion.

""There lie the púca, dead on the ground!"" He lifted his hands and swept them out dramatically. ""Smoke billowed from the rifle, a punctuation to a thrilling story— but hark! Cara was merely faking her injury!""

""When I knew him,"" Artemis said to me, ignoring Hypnos. ""He went by a different name.""

""A different name?""

""Yes. I knew him as Cu Chulainn.""

""Koo Cullan?"" I said slowly. ""What a strange name.""

^(""I do not believe she knew she would be shot. Nay. I) *^(do)* ^(believe she saw it as an opportunity. To see the new god in action against Hypnos, the Great! And with Efiáltis in his grasp! What a spectacular show for her master!"")

""It was not really a name,"" she answered, finally relaxing a bit. ""It was a moniker. I suppose I never knew his real name.""

^(""Sétanta separated us because, for one reason or another alluded to by the trickster púca, he is fearful of speaking with you! Some history you must have, hmm? Such intrigue!"")

""What does the nickname mean?"" I asked.

""It translates to Hound of Cullan, but I do not know the origin.""

""What happened between you guys?"" I asked.

She sighed and let her eyes drop to the left. ""Cu Chulainn was... my first love.""

A bolt of lightning raced down my spine. ""W-What?""

^(""... And then he choked me; lifted me off the ground and held me in the air! His fingers were so cold. I thought I would have to display my raw unfiltered power and reduce him to a stain on his own lawn! Hmhmhm, yes."")

""It is a long story, Buck,"" she said as gently as she was able.

>""If there is such a thing a perfect goddess, it is her. Anyone who would point their sword at her points it at me as well.""

His feelings for her were definitely still strong, that much was clear. How had I not seen it sooner? I felt vulnerable for the first time in a long time. Of *course,* Athena would take us to a plane where I had competition. Insecurity began creeping back in. Sétanta was jacked and handsome— and tall! I wasn't *shorter* than Artemis, but I wasn't nearly *a whole head taller than her* either.

""Why... does he seem afraid to talk to you?"" I asked next. ""He appears to be terrified of you.""

""As I said, it is a long story,"" she said a little firmer. ""A story for another time. We need to find the others. I... I yearn for some normalcy."" She looked at Hypnos, who was still rambling on about how he could have humbled Sétanta if he'd wanted to.

""Buck... You should not trust him.""

I turned to see him waving his arms around as he boasted forcefully into the forest. He wasn't even facing us anymore. I knew she was right. But were we truly any worse off if Hypnos added his power to Poseidon's? If he joined Ares, would we be any *more* screwed? To me, at least the way the gods talked about it, it'd be like adding an extra bucket of water to a hurricane. Our battle strength on the other hand, could potentially double if Hypnos were to join us.

""I know what you mean,"" I answered. ""But... the two of us are enough for him without his weapon.""

""We are not,"" she said. ""You have not seen Hypnos at form. Even without his sword, he is not defenseless. I would need my siblings at my side, and even then... it would take our combined efforts to match him.""

I felt a tinge of fear form in my midsection. ""You're saying... he could take us apart right now if he wanted?""

""... Yes,"" she nodded warily. ""I would buy you time to escape.""

That was unsettling. For some reason or another, I just could not commit it to memory that these gods could transform into behemoths. I looked down at my hands and closed them into fists.

""... Is there a chance that... *I* have a true form?""

She looked back at Hypnos and shrugged. ""A goddess could dream. It would be a great deal of help if you had some sort of transformation like that.""

""So, you're saying you don't know,"" I looked back at her.

""I do not,"" she shook her head. ""Nothing like you has happened before. There have arisen those born of god and mortal before."" She turned her eyes up and counted them across her fingers. ""Heracles, Perseus, Theseus, Minos, Castor... there are more."" She looked back at me. ""But none that were mortal first and then *became* divine."" She gestured toward me. ""I think... this *is* your true form.""

I detected dismay in her tone.

""Ah. Jealous are we?"" Hypnos interjected, walking up with a smug smile on his face. ""The coveted god form is not for mortals, Buck. You would do well to put it out of your mind.""

I shrugged. ""Do I look mortal to you?""

He cocked an eyebrow. ""... Hrm. A salient point. But a human would not know how to trigger their god form any more than a fish could imagine wiggling a monkey's prehensile tail. It is a foreign mechanism to you.""

""Maybe I could learn,"" I pressed. ""I mean... wouldn't I *have* to learn if we're going to be fighting Ares or Poseidon when they eventually find us? What good am I shooting at their toes?""

""I do not know if it is possible,"" he folded his arms. ""It may be folly even to try.""

""My sister would know,"" Artemis asserted. ""We need to make finding the others our top priority.""

""Agreed,"" I nodded. ""Sorry, Artemis. I'll stay focused from here on in."" I adjusted my rifle on my back and tightened the strap. ""Let's get moving.""

We started west but stopped when we didn't hear Hypnos behind us. We turned to see him several feet behind, his feet planted firmly in the grass. He stared at the two of us, uncertainty dominating him.

""You coming?"" I called back to him.

""... I believe,"" he said with pensive apprehension. ""That perhaps it is best that we part ways at this junction.""

Artemis and I exchanged glances.

This wasn't good. We needed his strength, especially if the others were still lying unconscious. Who knew what kinds of threats lurked around Otherworld? Despite speaking with Cara and Sétanta, we still knew next to nothing about this place. And there was also the fact that I didn't trust him yet. He'd be less dangerous, I felt, if he were nearby. We needed to keep eyes on him at all times.

""Where would you go?"" Artemis asked before I could respond.

""Elsewhere,"" the sleep god shrugged. ""I will not be well received by your siblings so soon after..."" He averted his eyes. ""... You know.""

Was that *shame* I just saw? I thought for sure he viewed the entire debacle as some sort of necessary transaction; a means to an end and nothing more. But the way he just broke eye contact with Artemis was telling. Hypnos was wrestling with *regret*. The longer I spent time among gods, the less godly they seemed. This was a remarkably human moment for him.

""You are right. I do not trust you,"" Artemis said. ""But you do not have another place to go. Gods do not handle seclusion well, as you are aware. It is perhaps safest for all of us that you join us for the time being.""

He sighed and looked left into the distance. ""I am impelled not,"" said calmly. ""For my further presence would serve only to impinge upon your peace with your siblings. None would rest."" He paused. ""Not a starry night without at least one eye on Hypnos. What dastardly deed is he contemplating next? How long until his fingers find my throat while I repose."" He looked at me and Artemis. ""I do not wish to be a prisoner... nor would I wish that on you or yours.""

He sounded sincere. The way he spoke was like something out of an old recording of a Shakespeare reading. I wondered what caused him to slip into the drama. It seemed to randomly pop up now and again. But just because he had a flare for the dramatics didn't mean he wasn't serious. He meant what he said and although I didn't know every word he used, the message was clear.

He didn't want to worry about us, and he didn't want us to have to worry about him.

""Hypnos,"" I stepped forward. ""I hear you, buddy, but... you have to understand that out here? In the middle of buttfuck nowhere on the planar stratum? Or the astral stratum, or whatever,"" I shrugged at Artemis. ""It doesn't matter who was born to what father or mother. We're all Greeks here. And that makes you our family too.""

Artemis looked at me, her expression a blur in my peripheral vision. I couldn't tell how she felt about that. I only hoped she wouldn't intervene. Having Hypnos with us truly was the best course of action, whether she realized it or not.

""We *need* to stick together out here,"" I added. ""And if that means overcoming what happened before, then dammit, we need to work toward that. Truth be told, I trust you and Sétanta about the same right now. Only difference is, I know how you tick. Everything you do is for you, and that makes your behavior predictable. Sétanta?"" I scoffed. ""Half of what he's done so far seems to be for kicks. For entertainment! He *could* be on our side in all of this. But his motivations aren't clear yet.""

Artemis's eyes fell to the grass.

""You keep doing what's best for Hypnos,"" I pointed at him. ""And what's best for Hypnos right now, without a sword, a compass, or a clue..."" I held his gaze. ""Is to stay with his family.""

He remained quiet.

""I might just be a baby to you guys,"" I looked between the two of them. ""And I know that it can be hard to take advice from me. But you're a purely logical being, Hypnos. You know I'm making sense right now, and you should really reconsider. I think when the others see Artemis and I traveling with you, I don't know, maybe they'll be willing to hear us out.""

Hypnos scoffed and shook his head, placing his hands his hands on his hips and looking down at the ground. He shifted his weight to one side and closed his eyes before tipping his gaze back up at the two of us.

""Artemis?"" he asked.

She looked at me with pleading eyes. I stiffened my face. She looked back to him and sighed. ""I do not like the temporary alliance I am being stuffed into. But I believe in Buck's words. We are Greeks. And we are stronger together. I will overlook your recent actions. But do not give me a reason to regret that.""

She looked to me. ""And if anything happens to us because of this decision, it is on *you*."" Her eyes were both stern and soft at the same time; and still beautiful. Oceans I could get lost in every time. I swooned a little as she turned and began marching west without us.

I looked at Hypnos and motioned for him to follow.

He maintained a muted expression as he did, not saying a single word.

And I was fine with that. He was a wordy bastard and I was tired of standing around talking; tired of feeling vulnerable. We needed to reunite with everyone else. Athena would be able to straighten everything out. Ever since we landed in Otherworld it's felt like some kind of fever dream. I craved clarity more than anything else, and a conversation with Athena would feel like a warm blanket and a cup of coffee.

I hoped she was okay. I hoped everyone else was okay too, but she looked particularly rough the last time I'd seen her. I didn't have a good barometer for how much time had passed either. Artemis kept ahead at a steady pace. Suddenly, she glanced over her shoulder at me.

It was a side-eye among side-eyes, as though she'd heard me mumble some shit under my breath. Without warning, she dropped back a bit. I stopped next to her.

""You may lead,"" she said. ""I... do not remember precisely where the spot was.""

""Uhh, you don't?"" I scratched my head. ""It was only a minute's walk at best. Alright, come on,"" I said, taking point.

After only about thirty more seconds, I spotted the large stones scattered about the ground. I pointed ahead as we pushed through the underbrush. ""Up there,"" I called back to the two of them. I picked up my pace and stumbled through some thick greenery before emerging into the area.

Athena, Apollo, and Hephaestus.

They were all gone.

I felt all my muscles tense up. Every ounce of optimism I had been faking evaporated. I felt my face burning as I stared at the empty area. I balled my fists and clenched my teeth.

""Fuck!"" I screamed, exasperated. ""Of course! Why the fuck not?"" I threw my arms in the air. ""Why would a single thing ever go right?""

""Buck,"" Artemis attempted to intervene.

I dropped my knees and screamed in frustration, pounding the grass with both of my fists. The rifle on my back smacked me in the back of the head and I tore it off, throwing it against a tree. ""Dammit! Why? Where would they even go? Did someone take them? Are we dealing with *that* bullshit now? I'm so fucking sick of this!"" I let out another long scream and raked through the soil with my fingernails.

""Buck, what is happening?"" Artemis asked, her tone full with worry. ""Buck, speak to me!""

""He is still part human,"" Hypnos answered her. ""You may not know this about them, but they do not tend to handle prolonged stress very well.""

""Stress?"" she asked.

""Each human has a breaking point. This is part of their venting process. He will engage in chimp-like behavior for a few moments longer.""

""Oh. I had forgotten humans were descended from chimpanzees.""

""I do not know for certain,"" he added. ""I am not as studied on humankind as your sister Athena is, but I believe humans and chimpanzees merely share an ancestor. I do not think they are direct descendants.""

I really wished the two of them shut up. They had no idea what I was going through. In the span of days, I learned that the Olympian gods were real, I *became* a god, got chased off my plane of existence by forces so powerful I couldn't possibly comprehend them, lost everyone I had ever known probably forever, and now I was living in a world where I didn't know who was who, because anyone could just be a púca for some reason, and at the same time, I could still be in some magical castle with no way out.

Nothing made sense.

Up was down.

East was west.

And I wanted nothing more than to just close my eyes and go to sleep.

But I couldn't even do that because the others had to wake up and wander off somewhere. Why did it start to feel like I was babysitting the gods? I clutched the sides of my head and let out another long scream. I could feel the urge to turn it into a long cry, but I stifled it.

I felt like I was in a long fever dream that I just couldn't wake up from. I always yearned for adventure; for a life outside of my average nine to five. I always wanted to be strong— someone important. But I never knew how much I would miss an ordinary life.

I wanted to go to sleep. Wake up, grab a gallon of chocolate milk out of my fridge, and chug the whole damn thing next to a box of open donuts. I wanted to watch American Dad starting from season one and just binge it, ordering pizzas when I got hungry. I wanted to replay some of my old favorite video games. I wanted to get started on the board game I always wanted to create, but never did. I wanted to carpet-bomb my dating apps and see if anyone wanted to go to a movie with me.

*I wanted an average life back.*

""Buck!""

I looked up at Artemis and Hypnos and the two of them stared back down at me.

""Your body,"" Hypnos recoiled. ""It's ugly again!""

I looked down at myself and found that my hands had aged. My gut had returned. I was wearing my hunting gear— the same as the day I stumbled across Artemis.

Their heads snapped south.

""I can sense them,"" Hypnos announced.

""I as well,"" Artemis added in an ominous tone, casting me a concerned look. ""... Buck?""

I swallowed. ""Oh. Oh, *shit.""*

For context - My ex (M20) and I (F20) broke up only 8 days ago. The breakup was initiated by him, although we both knew it was going to end since we’re both busy and we were arguing a lot. Initially, I didn’t take the breakup well, and tried begging for him to stay (im ashamed of this for sure), but it finally ended amicably. The breakup was on his terms: “no contact”aka no talking, but keeping each other on social media platforms. 

There were some talks of us meeting up around Christmas just to “catch up” over coffee and exchange gifts we already bought for each other. He showed only slight interest in this, but I was pushing it because I wanted to see him again in person one last time (didn’t want to let go). He also stated that maybe we could be friends later on. 

I did break contact twice this past week. Once to ask for my things back, and I tried calling him drunk another night. Fast forward last night, I stalked his socials a little too hard and found out him and another girl followed each other. I already knew he was talking to other girls on snapchat, so I put two and two together.

It was then that I was DONE. I removed him from all socials, deleted his number and contact and sent him the message in the first pic telling him to keep the gift (spindleshanks). 

So basically im here to ask - what do I make of this? He’s been rather cold up until now so im utterly confused. Does he genuinely want to be friends again? If so, I could be his friend as well got along well, but I cannot fathom dating anybody for a while. What do I do? ",1,1733088284.0,ExNoContact,6,1.0,False

1h4dwu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1h4dwu1/one_year_floxed/,One Year Floxed,"I took my first levofloxacin pill one year ago today.

I had very bad anxiety that night and took an ativan.  I continued to take 5 more pills and didn't finish the script due to my achilles hurting.  It was tingling initially but then got worse.  The anxiety cleared within a day of stopping the medication.  The leg continued to hurt for a month, spread to my shoulders and then my gums started bleeding.  I decided to try to rehab my leg and shoulders as I have had to do PT for a previous shoulder surgery.  I had some diclofenac still from that surgery and decided to take it to help alleviate the inflammation.  Within two days of taking those my anxiety got very bad, I developed serious floaters in my eyes, insomnia, brain fog/confusion, tinnitus, tingling in my thumbs, pain in thumbs when using them, burning sensation in leg. popping and cracking all over body, and skin issues (cracking/splitting) etc.  That's how I ended up here.

I continued  to ride my stationary bike as much as possible and hot tub soaks 2x a day.

The anxiety issue cleared within about a month but everything else stayed.

I have seen PCP, Rheumatologist, and Hematologist.  I had a slew of blood tests and everything came back normal.  I also got an aortic life screen roughly 90 days after taking the drug and that came back ok.

Since the start I have been taking a whey, metamucil, collagen shake every morning.  Because of the skin issues I have been taking a half capful of miralax because I tear when I use the bathroom if it's not soft.  I have also been using gtn ointment when needed.  This started after the floxing.  I quit coffee for a long while but started drinking it again with no issues.

In July I was feeling a little more spry so I decided to mix in daily standard doses of :

Magnesium L-Threonate, coq10, Omega 3, ALA, Astaxanthin, and a basic multivitamin.

I added these one at a time slowly and didn't notice any issues and started feeling a little better.

I felt well enough to start vaping marijuana again.  It made me feel better immediately without issue.

I was at this cycle since August.  I was still dealing with skin, gums, shoulder, thumbs, tinnitus, and achilles.  I kinda felt like I was getting better though.

I had thanksgiving dinner at a fancy restaurant with family and when I got home I took a nap.  I woke up about 30 minutes later to an immense anxiety attack.  I've been in it since thursday unfortunately and treating with ativan as needed.  This isn't like my normal anxiety, that usually goes away after a night of rest.  This isn't as intense as it was during the initial round however.  I haven't had alcohol since january.  I haven't noticed any sort of flare from eating food previously.

I'm bummed because I was doing so well.  Past couple days I've dropped out and tried different combos of supplements with no change.  I can't see the cold snap causing the anxiety flare, that never happened to me before with my GAD.

Anyways, I hope everyone is well and on the mend.

Please hang in there and thank you all for being here for each other.  

It's a bummer to not write something totally positive after a year but I'm hanging in there.

The holiday season, often portrayed as a time of joy, connection, and celebration, can also be marked by loneliness and isolation for many. If you resonate with this, knowing you’re not alone is essential. The pressure to appear festive, unmet expectations, or challenging circumstances can make the holidays feel more isolating than inspiring. But remember, you're part of a larger community that shares these feelings.

Here, we’ll explore the challenges of loneliness during this season and empower you with actionable steps to navigate it healthily.

# The Challenges of Holiday Loneliness

1. **Emotional Weight:** Loneliness during the holidays can amplify feelings of sadness, anxiety, and even depression. The feeling that others are with their loved ones can lead to isolation. 
2. **Strained Relationships:** This time of year can resurface old wounds, particularly with family or friends. The holidays may be a painful reminder if these relationships are absent or strained.
3. **Loss of Purpose:** Without a sense of connection, the holidays can feel hollow, leaving you questioning your purpose and place in the world. This loss of meaning can lead to disengagement from what truly matters.

# Five Ways to Empower Yourself During the Holiday Season

1. **Focus on Gratitude:** Gratitude, with its transformative power, can be your beacon of hope. Start or end each day by jotting down three things you’re thankful for, whether it’s as simple as a warm cup of coffee, the crispness of the winter air, or a meaningful conversation with someone. By intentionally shifting your focus to the positive aspects of your life, you can train your brain to notice and appreciate the good, even during challenging times. Gratitude also helps combat negative thought spirals, giving you a solid emotional foundation to build on.
2. **Reach Out:** Loneliness can often trick you into believing nobody cares, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. Make an intentional effort to reach out, even if it initially feels awkward or uncomfortable. Start with people who’ve been supportive in the past, like friends, family, or colleagues. If you’re unsure where to start, consider joining a local interest group or attending holiday events in your community. These small acts of connection can bridge deeper relationships, creating a support network when needed.
3. **Set Meaningful Intentions:** When the usual holiday traditions don’t align with your current season of life, take the reins and create new ones that reflect who you are and what you value. Maybe you can dedicate an afternoon to volunteering at a local shelter, which uplifts others and fills your spirit with purpose. Or perhaps you can start a creative project, like crafting ornaments, baking for neighbors, or writing heartfelt holiday letters. These personal traditions can ground you and provide a sense of accomplishment, even without typical festivities.
4. **Prioritize Self-Care:** The holidays can be physically and emotionally draining, but taking care of yourself is not a luxury. It's a necessity. It gives you the energy to engage with what matters most. Physical activity can elevate your mood and help reduce stress. Nutrition also plays a significant role—balance indulgences with nutrient-rich meals that fuel your body. On a deeper level, self-care can mean setting boundaries, saying no to activities that drain you, and creating space for rest and reflection. Remember, self-care is not selfish; it’s essential and a way of showing yourself that you matter.
5. **Join a Community:** There’s immense power in walking alongside others who share similar struggles, goals, and perspectives. If you’ve felt disconnected, joining a group or community can provide the camaraderie you need. Whether it’s an online support group, a local club, or a faith-based gathering, these spaces offer a safe environment to share, listen, and grow together. A strong community can remind you that you’re not alone and that your voice and experiences matter. For men seeking a more profound, intentional connection with others, communities like **Redefining Manhood** offer a unique opportunity to explore purpose, strengthen leadership, and engage with peers on the same journey. Redefining Manhood is a supportive community that values vulnerability, growth, and connection. It's a space where men can share their experiences, learn from each other, and redefine what it means to be a man in today's world.

# A Call to Redefine Manhood

Suppose you’re a man navigating the holiday season and seeking a community of like-minded individuals to journey with. In that case, I invite you to learn about my upcoming cohort, **Redefining Manhood: Beyond the Provider.** This program will help men like you strengthen their emotional, spiritual, and leadership capacities while connecting with others on a similar path.

Suppose you’re ready to step into a community where you can grow, support, and be supported. In that case, I’d love to share more about how **Redefining Manhood** can help you navigate the holiday season and the broader challenges of life.

Schedule a complimentary call to learn more about Redefining Manhood and discover how to redefine what manhood means to you. This call lets us get to know each other, discuss your goals, and see if Redefining Manhood fits you.

I'm opening a lunch spot soon where I'll be serving coffee, matcha, sandwiches, and pastries. While my priority isn't to be a ""coffeeshop,"" I still want to offer high-quality coffee with great beans. My location is near two well-known coffee shops in the city, so I’m unsure how much foot traffic my coffee offering will get initially.

I’m deciding between two espresso machines: the La Marzocco Linea Classic S (1 group) and the La Nuova Era Altea Wood (2 groups). The Linea costs around €6,000, while the Altea is €4,200, so there’s a significant price difference. The Altea has 2 groups, which seems like an advantage for efficiency, but it’s a single boiler machine, which makes me hesitant. On the other hand, the Linea has 1 group but is known for its reliability and quality. I also personally prefer the aesthetics of the Linea. I’ll be investing in a good grinder, so that’s not a concern.

Is it worth spending almost €2,000 more for the Linea, even though it has one less group? I’d love to hear your thoughts and any advice on whether the Linea’s quality would outweigh the Altea’s additional group. Thanks!",2,1733087900.0,LaMarzocco,0,1.0,False

1h4dqms,https://www.reddit.com/r/attachment_theory/comments/1h4dqms/exfa_and_i_rekindled_it_ended_the_exact_same/,Ex-FA and I rekindled. It ended the exact same,"I (36M) started dating my ex-FA (35F) for three months in late 2022 which ended in late February of 2023.

The relationship moved steadily and we would hang one night a week during the first two months. Date nights were fun and intimate and we started to become physical after the three week mark. Our values and vision for the future aligned and I felt I had met my person.

She told me she felt safe and secure and started asking for more time with me. She invited me to meet her brother and sister-in-law and everything felt cozy and natural. She was very texty and present when we would spend time together. 

The next week was her birthday and she invited me to her parents' house to celebrate (she lived with them). During the invite, she trauma dumped about her abusive ex who she had filed a restraining order against which was unexpected but I supported her through it.

The party went great, her family loved me, and all felt right in the world. The next morning she ended the relationship via text, became cold and distant, and gave me no closure (not even a phone call). I was devastated and chased for a few weeks which resulted in heated exchanges. She re-wrote history and said that I was ""narssistictic"" and ""didn't listen to her."" She also said that it was strange that I found her attractive because of how ""sickly she was"" at the time. 

Anyway, nearly two years later, we ran into each other and she text me after. She said she hadn't dated since me so she could ""get her life in order"" and wasn't planning until dating until she healed from a scheduled surgery in January. She invited me to a coffee and I agreed under the pretense of it being a ""friendly catch up.""

We caught up and didn't get too deep or anything, but it was nice. Afterward, she started to become more flirty and suggestive of romance. She invited me out to ice-cream a week later and we were more touchy and flirty and made out. She asked me out to a hike and we agreed to continue forward. 

A few days before the hike, I was in her area and we agreed to grab dinner. We spoke about the past (I brought it up, per conversations with my therapist) and addressed what happened the first time. She stated she was ""so lost"" back then and apologized for hurting me. I also apologized for any hurt and we agreed that we were both at a better place. She then invited me to Thanksgiving at her parents' which I accepted. 

The next Sunday we hiked together which was a lot of fun. We grabbed dinner after and she was vulnerable again and stated that her surgery was a partial-hysterectomy and that she would not be able to conceive children. I supported her and told her it wasn't a deal-breaker for me. She talked and opened up a lot and it was a nice conversation.

We spoke more about the future and expectations of how to do better this time. Everything felt so great. She then asked if we could be exclusive again, to which I agreed (*internally hesitant, I might add). We then agreed to have a movie night the Sunday after Thanksgiving.

Thanksgiving went great and it was a lot of fun seeing her family. The deja-vu anxiety was creeping in. After, we hugged and kissed in her driveway and I drove home, praying that things would be different.

The next morning, she text and all was well. Phew. Texting continued throughout the day and I felt a bit more relaxed. She was chatty and inquisitive and I truly felt that we were re-writing history. On Saturday, however, she ended things via text in the same fashion as before, even making note of how ""this will feel like deja-vu."" 

The reasons? She made a ""promise to herself"" not to date someone again who had ""hurt her in the past"" and that she didn't feel we were compatible for a slew of nit-picked random reasons. Though she pushed for our initial hangouts, a relationship label, and Thanksgiving, etc., she said that the thought of being in a relationship with me ""after the past we've had"" felt wrong and that although we both may have changed, the timing ""still didn't feel right"" and that we should ""close the book for good"".

I asked for a phone call, bringing up our promise to be open, honest, and communicative, and she said, ""we're not having a phone call. I never promised one, and I don't want to."" The exact same reaction she had nearly two years prior. When I said we could work through this by communicating, she said, ""Why would I talk to someone else when it's a personal decision not to be in a relationship?""

Once I saw the fangs coming out again, I sent a final text, which was essentially ""unliterally ending our relationship after inviting me into your home for Thanksgiving and welcoming a commitment with me is more than simply a personal deicison; it's a breach of trust and integrity with respect to what you told me during our dinners."" 

I then thanked her for the good times we had over the last six weeks. She simply stated, ""Thank you. Best wishes."" And that was that.

So there you are, folks. That's what rekindling with an unhealed/unaware FA is like. She is enjoying her separation elation, and I'm beginning to heal.

1h4dox1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI__Stories/comments/1h4dox1/crossroads_ballad/,Crossroads Ballad,"# Crossroads Ballad

Daniel had lived at the crossroads for as long as he could remember, a patch of land that seemed older than time itself. The small clapboard house he called home stood at the convergence of two dusty roads, hemmed in by an open field to one side and a stand of gnarled pecan trees to the other. The crossroads wasn’t much of a destination, but it was always a place people passed through. And pass through they did—pilgrims with desperate eyes, wanderers with heavy hearts, and seekers with fire in their veins.

He had grown up here, under the wide expanse of sky and the ever-watchful sun. His father had taught him to fix wagon wheels and later showed him how to tinker with engines when the age of horses gave way to the age of machines. His mother had taught him to listen, though not to the voices of people. “The land has a song, Daniel,” she’d say. “If you’re quiet enough, you’ll hear it.”

It was a quiet life, but the music… always, that music.

The first time he heard it, he was just a boy, barely tall enough to see over the weathered fence that separated their property from the road. It was night, and the sound rose up like a wildfire—a wailing fiddle, sharp and fierce, dueling with the soulful moan of a guitar. His father had found him standing in the yard, barefoot in his nightshirt, staring out at the crossroads with wide eyes. “Go back inside, boy,” his father had muttered, not unkindly. “It’s not for us.”

But Daniel couldn’t resist. Over the years, he’d seen many of these musical duels, each one as strange and mesmerizing as the last. They always happened at night, always at the very heart of the crossroads, where the moonlight cast long, eerie shadows. And there was always a devil—though not always the same one. Some were tall and lean, with coal-black skin and eyes like burning embers. Others looked like polished gentlemen, their crimson suits sharp as razors. Once, he’d seen a devil who looked like a child, her laughter high and tinkling as she plucked the strings of a golden harp.

They would pit themselves against some poor soul—a traveling musician, a desperate dreamer, or an aging master clinging to fading glory. The music was fast and furious, a clash of wills that seemed to vibrate through the very air. Sometimes the challenger won, and they’d walk away with a spring in their step and a spark in their eyes. Other times, they lost, and the devil would collect their due. Daniel never saw what happened to those who lost, but he didn’t need to. He could feel the emptiness they left behind, a chill that lingered long after the music had faded.

For Daniel, it didn’t matter much who won or lost. His concern was with the aftermath. There was always someone who needed help—sometimes a beaten-down musician with a broken instrument or a shattered spirit, and other times a weary traveler with a busted axle or an overheated engine. He patched up horses in his youth and fixed wagons by lantern light. These days, it was more likely he’d be jump-starting a car battery or siphoning gas from one tank to another. It wasn’t glamorous work, but it was honest, and it kept him busy.

One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and the sky turned the color of a bruise, Daniel heard the familiar strains of a fiddle. He leaned back in his chair on the porch, listening as the music swelled. It was haunting, full of longing and defiance. Curious, he stood and walked toward the crossroads, his boots crunching on the gravel.

When he arrived, he saw a young woman standing there, her back straight and her hands steady on the neck of her guitar. Opposite her stood a devil unlike any Daniel had seen before. This one was a gaunt figure with skin like tarnished silver and a smile that was all teeth. In his long, bony fingers, he held a violin that gleamed like it had been forged from starlight.

The duel had already begun, and the music poured forth like a river. The woman’s guitar sang of heartbreak and hope, her fingers dancing across the strings with a skill that made Daniel’s chest ache. The devil’s violin answered with a song of chaos and fury, each note cutting through the night like a blade. The air around them seemed to shimmer, and Daniel felt the hair on his arms stand on end.

He knew better than to interfere, so he stayed on the edge of the scene, watching. The duel raged on, the music growing louder and more intense. The woman’s face was a mask of concentration, beads of sweat rolling down her temples. The devil’s smile widened, his movements almost lazy as he coaxed impossible sounds from his instrument.

And then, just as the woman’s guitar seemed to falter, she did something unexpected. She closed her eyes and began to sing. Her voice was raw and powerful, rising above the clash of strings. It was a song of defiance, of refusing to give in even when the odds were stacked against you. The devil hesitated, his bow faltering for just a moment—and that was all it took. The woman’s guitar roared back to life, her fingers flying across the frets in a final, triumphant crescendo.

When the last note faded, the devil lowered his violin and gave her a slow, mocking clap. “Well done,” he said, his voice like gravel. “You’ve won this round. But I’ll be back.”

With that, he vanished, leaving only a faint smell of brimstone behind. The woman sagged, her guitar hanging limply at her side. Daniel stepped forward, offering her a hand. “You alright?” he asked.

She looked up at him, her eyes weary but defiant. “I’m fine,” she said, though her voice was hoarse. “Thanks.”

Daniel nodded, his gaze lingering on the guitar. It was an old instrument, battered and scarred, but it had a soul. He could feel it, humming faintly in the cool night air. “You need a place to rest?” he offered. “Got a spare room and some coffee back at the house.”

The woman hesitated, then nodded. “That’d be nice.”

As they walked back to his house, Daniel glanced over his shoulder at the crossroads. The moonlight bathed it in an otherworldly glow, and for a moment, he thought he heard a faint melody on the breeze. Shaking his head, he turned away. Life at the crossroads was strange, but it was home—and he wouldn’t have it any other way.",1,1733087557.0,AI__Stories,0,1.0,False

1h4dlge,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiContentDetection/comments/1h4dlge/best_gptzero_alternatives_a_deep_dive_into_ai/,Best GPTZero Alternatives: A Deep Dive into AI Detection Tools [Performance & Accuracy Analysis],"Hey everyone! After spending way too many hours testing different AI detection tools (and probably drinking too much coffee), I wanted to share my real experience with the alternatives to GPTZero. Trust me, there are some hidden gems out there!

# The Problem with GPTZero

Look, GPTZero was great when it came out, but lately I've been getting too many false positives on my own writing (super frustrating!) and it struggles with newer AI models. Time for alternatives!

# Top Alternatives I've Actually Tested:

# 1. [Polygraf.ai](http://Polygraf.ai) - My Top Pick 🏆

* **Why I love it:** Seriously impressive accuracy. I tested it with both AI and human content, and it rarely gets it wrong
* **Speed:** Lightning fast compared to GPTZero
* **Best feature:** Their detailed reports actually make sense (unlike some cryptic scores I've seen)
* **Downside:** Free tier is somewhat limited, but worth paying for if you need it regularly

# 2. Copyleaks - Solid Runner-Up

* **Standout feature:** Great for bulk checking
* **Accuracy:** Pretty reliable, especially with longer texts
* **Cool thing:** Integrates well with other tools
* **Meh point:** Interface could be more user-friendly

# 3. Content at Scale

* **Surprising find:** Their detector is surprisingly accurate
* **Pro:** Great for marketing content
* **Con:** More business-focused, might be overkill for casual users

# 4. [Originality.ai](http://Originality.ai)

* **Unique thing:** Good at catching content from newer AI models
* **Liked:** Clear, straightforward results
* **Didn't like:** Subscription model might not suit everyone

# Why I Settled on [Polygraf.ai](http://Polygraf.ai)

After weeks of testing, I kept coming back to Polygraf.ai. Here's why:

* Most consistent results (tested it with ChatGPT, Claude, and human content)
* Fast enough that I don't have to grab another coffee while waiting
* Actually helpful support (yes, I tested that too!)
* Regular updates that keep up with new AI models

# Quick Price Comparison

* GPTZero: Free tier + paid plans
* Polygraf.ai: Free tier + flexible paid options (best value IMO)
* Copyleaks: Pay-as-you-go
* Others: Various subscription models

# Bottom Line

If you're frustrated with GPTZero's accuracy lately, give [Polygraf.ai](http://Polygraf.ai) a shot. It's been a game-changer for me, especially for checking important content where accuracy really matters.

**TL;DR:** [Polygraf.ai](http://Polygraf.ai) is currently the best GPTZero alternative based on actual testing. Better accuracy, faster results, and worth the switch if you're getting annoyed with false positives.",1,1733087308.0,AiContentDetection,1,1.0,False

","After I quit smoking, my life changed drastically for the better, in terms of my health, appearance, and finances. But out of all the positive changes that came with quitting, I would place **freedom** at the very top of the list.

Before I quit smoking, I was convinced that I wouldn’t be able to enjoy the things I loved like a cup of coffee or going out with friends without a cigarette in hand. It was hard even to imagine myself in those situations without smoking. But what frustrated me the most was realizing that I was a slave to cigarettes.

Every decision, every moment, revolved around smoking. I couldn’t go to sleep peacefully unless I was sure I had enough cigarettes for the night. If I didn’t, I would have to go out into the cold in the middle of the night to buy another pack, just to “be prepared.” I couldn’t concentrate on studying unless I knew I had cigarettes within reach because what if I suddenly craved one? I would have to stop everything to go and buy some.

Now that I no longer smoke, those worries are gone. I don’t think about whether I have enough cigarettes. When I go out for dinner with friends, I don’t have to run outside into the cold or rain to light up, watching them enjoy themselves from the window while I stand outside. It’s incredible how we take freedom for granted until we lose it.

Cigarettes trap us so easily. Once we start smoking, we quickly forget what life was like before them. We become so consumed with thinking about the next cigarette that we don’t even have time to remember what it feels like to be truly free.

Freedom is priceless. I no longer wake up in the middle of the night to smoke one more cigarette. I no longer plan every moment of my day around cigarettes. I’m finally living my life free.

If you’re thinking about quitting smoking, know that every bit of effort is worth the freedom waiting for you on the other side.",14,1733087218.0,quittingsmoking,2,1.0,False

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement. I also drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Looking to get experimental while still grounded in melody and some loose structure. I've played guitar, bass and synths in screamo, hardcore, metal, punk, post-punk, synth pop, chillwave, and heavy electronic bands.

Some bands I'm influenced by: Thee Oh Sees, Black Country New Road, QOTSA, Mogwai, Blonde Redhead, Idles.

I have a couple of songs that I've been playing around with but would like to collaborate with someone to help me understand what I have. I can also share full songs from past projects. If you're interested, reach out with what a little bit about yourself and some audio to trade.

  
I have a small home studio, but am eager to get a shared space with a drum kit. I live on the border of Bedstuy and Bushwick and am open to getting a studio around there. The priority for me is just writing songs together and eventually DIY recording. Definitely open to playing shows once we're feeling good about it.

Oh, a little bit about me: 42/m 420 friendly coffee addict. I own a design studio in Brooklyn so I have some flexibility over my schedule. Open to playing with all races, genders, sexual orientations, whatever. Just don't be a Trump supporter. I can't deal with that right now.

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement. I also drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

When I was younger I was extremely shy and clearly bad at social relationships, time has improved this situation for me even if it's still a bit complicated. I almost never felt really comfortable, sadness and depressive feelings have been companions since I was little but like a lot of people. In short, I have nothing really special, and a year ago everything went to hell.
I'm 22, I like to drink and take drugs to unwind, without being in an addictive relationship. One evening I have fun and I drink a lot with friends, the night goes by and the next day to cope with the hangover I drink a lot of coffee, the day goes by and in the evening I feel bad, a kind of nausea takes hold of me and I feel my heart beating particularly hard.
 I don't know it at the time but I've just fallen into a spiral of shit.
I worry about my body so I focus on my heart and it's escalating, my heart races, it palpitates, I start to feel stiff all over my body. I start to run then I collapse on the ground thinking that it's the end, I'm convinced I'm having a heart attack. My father who saw me, calls an ambulance and I'm taken to the hospital.
Urine test, blood test and electrocardiogram passed, I'm told that I'm just having a panic attack. It literally takes me hours to come down emotionally, I spend the next day sleeping.

Well... I would have liked this thing to be just an occasional episode quickly forgotten but after that I start to develop a psychosis, I become hyper vigilant. Anxiety takes over my mind and my body.  I drag myself around for months with the anxiety of having a heart problem until I finally have an exam, a heart ultrasound. The cardiologist tells me that my heart is in perfect health. Well, that's cool, I'm happy, but even though I'm reassured, my body continues to make me suffer.
At the moment, I've had recurring dizziness for months, pain in my hands and legs due to venous swelling, I sometimes have muscle weakness that makes it difficult for me to move. Also, my breathing is inefficient and I constantly feel like I'm short of air, I feel a constant oppression in my heart. My blood pressure is very changeable, when I get up after sitting down for example, I have a loss of tension that is accompanied by an intense pressure in my body that I can't really describe.  The truth of all this is that I am in pain, I am suffering but every time I see a doctor it is difficult for me to describe my symptoms because they are so strange, especially in my upper body. Doctors spend their time telling me that it will pass, that I have to rest and that there is nothing serious so I am spinning, I feel helpless. Forgive me for this somewhat long text but I had to speak, so that this can resonate with some people, I am trying as much to help people through my story as to be helped.

I’ve kept up with boosters, switched to working remote, don’t eat in restaurants, wear an N95 most everywhere… and I still managed to get Covid again in September. Im not totally sure how but suspect it was a rare in-office day when I pulled the mask down to drink coffee. I resolved to do better about masking, but it’s so hard to socialize for any period of time in the winter without pulling it down to drink. I got a sip valve but that doesn’t really work for coffee or wine.

Well, last weekend me and a trusted friend went to see a play. We both masked with N95s but pulled them down occasionally to take a sip of wine. I figured rates are low right now in my city, but nope, that was all it took. She tested positive the next day, and now I’m feeling sick. I’m so devastated. It seems like keeping a 3M Aura sealed to my face at all times is the only way— no sharing food and drink even for seconds, and maybe no indoor events at all even when it’s too cold to be outside. 

I am trying to strategize about how to do this without tanking what remains of my social life (I already avoid parties, bars and restaurants) and my mental health (working alone and living alone is really wearing on me). I ordered a PlusLife and am thinking that may work for having people over my place but I’m so wary now. I want to remain in functional enough health but it always feels like I’m putting my physical health against my mental health, and I’m not sure what to do anymore. How are you all managing? What trade-offs work for you?

My doctor sent a prescription for 90 days back in mid September and at some point during the last two months, I lost some of my medication. I had some in my purse, sometimes I forget to take meds until I get to work so I kept some in there. I can't get more for 14 days. I have 2 pills left that I decided to wait and take until tomorrow (Monday) and Tuesday, for work. 

But I don't feel bad. And I haven't. Maybe a little more tired than usual. My question is, should I not take the vyvanse tomorrow and Tuesday? Will it make it harder for the other 12 days until I get my refill? I honestly haven't felt bad at all. I do have a high pressure job and these past 3 days (including today) I've been off work because of the holiday. Monday's are my long day, would it be bad to just take the two I have on the two Monday's before my refill?

I read somewhere that withdrawals from amphetamine don't come until day 4 (which would be tomorrow) but I honestly can't see feeling bad tomorrow unless I genuinely become sick from a cold or whatever has been going around.

I've been working on prompt generation for interior designs inspired by pop culture and video games. The goal is to create creative and visually striking spaces that blend elements from movies, TV shows, games, and music into cohesive, stylish interiors. 

Here are some examples of prompts I’ve used to generate these pop-culture-inspired interior images. 

**A dedicated gaming room with an immersive Call of Duty theme, showcasing a wall mural of iconic game scenes and logos in high-definition realism. The space includes a plush gaming chair positioned in front of dual monitors, with a custom-built desk featuring a rugged metal finish. Bright overhead industrial-style lights cast a clear, focused glow on the workspace, while LED panels under the desk provide a soft blue light. A shelf filled with collectible action figures and game memorabilia sits in the corner, enhancing the theme without cluttering the layout.**

**A family game room that emphasizes entertainment and relaxation, showcasing oversized Grand Theft Auto posters and memorabilia on the walls. The space includes a plush sectional in vibrant colors, oriented towards a wide-screen TV with ambient LED lighting. A large coffee table made from reclaimed wood adds rustic charm, while shelves are filled with game consoles and accessories. Bright overhead lights and accent lighting highlight the playful decor, creating an inviting atmosphere for family gatherings.**

**A modern living room designed with a prominently displayed oversized Fallout logo as a mural on one wall, surrounded by various nostalgic Fallout game elements like Nuka-Cola bottles and Vault-Tec posters. The space features a sectional sofa in distressed leather, positioned to face a coffee table made of reclaimed wood, and a retro arcade machine tucked in the corner. Natural light streams through large windows with sheer curtains, while adjustable LED lights are placed strategically on shelves to highlight collectibles.**

I only mention his age because he doesnt have a ton of money to blow on trialing new parts lol. 


So here's the situation: the pc will turn on, all fans spin, keyboard lights up, mouse will light up briefly and then turn off, cpu EZ debug light is lit, monitor backlight will turn on and then it will say no signal and turn off. We let it run in this state for a minute or two and it never restarted or turned off. 

Admittedly some of the parts are pretty old at this point, the cpu, ram, cpu cooler, and psu (that is now replaced) came from my own original pc build from 2017. 

Parts list:
- MSI b360
- Asus tuf gaming 1660 super
- I5 coffee lake generation
- 2 x 8GB G.skill ripjaws ram
- Thermaltake smart 700w psu (just bought today)
- Cryorig h7 quadlumi cpu cooler
- Samsung ssd
- can't remember the hard drive lol


Things we've tried:
- Reseating the RAM, and trying them in different configurations (I.e. one stick, different slots)
- removing and replacing thermal paste on CPU
- reseated GPU
- replaced old EVGA psu with new thermaltake psu listed above
- reseated and inspected CPU, no bent or broken pins noted, chip looked to be in good condition
- tried to enter BIOS but got no video output via GPU or motherboard
- Unplugged and replugged in all connections on the motherboard


I chose to try replacing the psu first based on this post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/s/y129tpxF8s

And obviously a power supply is cheaper than a cpu or motherboard. He did mention that the GPU is louder than usual but I don't think that's the issue. 

At this point I'm leaning towards the motherboard. My understanding is that if the CPU was bad, nothing would happen at all when we try to turn it on.

I'm opening a lunch spot soon where I'll be serving coffee, matcha, sandwiches, and pastries. While my priority isn't to be a ""coffeeshop,"" I still want to offer high-quality coffee with great beans. My location is near two well-known coffee shops in the city, so I’m unsure how much foot traffic my coffee offering will get initially.

I’m deciding between two espresso machines: the La Marzocco Linea Classic S (1 group) and the La Nuova Era Altea Wood (2 groups). The Linea costs around €6,000, while the Altea is €4,200, so there’s a significant price difference. The Altea has 2 groups, which seems like an advantage for efficiency, but it’s a single boiler machine, which makes me hesitant. On the other hand, the Linea has 1 group but is known for its reliability and quality. I also personally prefer the aesthetics of the Linea. I’ll be investing in a good grinder, so that’s not a concern.

Is it worth spending almost €2,000 more for the Linea, even though it has one less group? I’d love to hear your thoughts and any advice on whether the Linea’s quality would outweigh the Altea’s additional group and lower cost in the long run. Thanks!",1,1733086554.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I know someone who used to work very closely with Bhumi (I’ll share the exact job with the mods privately since some celebrities also read this sub). The stories they’ve told me are WILD. Bhumi is allegedly the most Chindiest person in Bollywood. She would calculate even if one extra potato or onion was used! She would bring exactly the amount of vegetables needed for her, her sister, and not one bit extra ,the person who stayed over for worl she would tell that person to arrange their own food.

The person was underpaid for the work Bhumi made them do. Bhumi wouldn’t even get up to fetch her own coffee and would yell if it wasn’t served on time. One time, while on set with Kartik and Ananya, she loudly screamed at this person, ""Where’s my coffee?"" Kartik apparently told her, ""Please don’t shout at them like that."" Bhumi then tried to act bubbly, saying, ""Arey yaar, inko apna kaam hi nahi aata.""

At that time, Bhumi was reportedly hooking up with Jackky Bhagnani. According to this person, she has zero sense of dressing; they had to style her and stop her from wearing outfits that looked atrocious. She is allegedly very insecure about her body and would shout if this person looked better than her. Bhumi even told them to ""dress down"" at events.

There was one incident where she took this person to a party, and Ibrahim Ali Khan flirted with them. Bhumi apparently fired them as soon as they reached home, though she acted like nothing happened the next morning without apologizing. She supposedly talks in a very crude, ""sadak-chaap"" way. Her sister sometimes outshines her in appearance, and Bhumi doesn’t know how to even handle her own Instagram or captions she has zero social media game —this person did all of that. Eventually, they quit because they couldn’t handle Bhumi’s chindipana anymore.

Now, onto Malaika: This comes from a friend of the same person, who used to handle Malaika’s social media. Malaika is described as “okay,” but the chats between her and Arjun Kapoor were shocking. Arjun reportedly used very abusive language every sentence had r word c word and very sadakchaap talks like you wouldn't expect a padha likha celebrity to talk like this , including slurs, and the two would constantly only talk about sex or some hawasiya talks. Their relationship sounded toxic, with Arjun allegedly disrespecting her often he used to say anything to her.

Lastly, Mouni Roy: I heard this from a close source of someone I know, so I’m just sharing what they said. Apparently, Mouni was called to Salman Khan’s resort or some similar venue, where there were 4-5 Arab men from Dubai. She was allegedly paid to dance and do “other things.” The next morning, she told her friend that she was ""used"" and hadn’t been paid yet.

1h4d5zs,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1h4d5zs/religious_trauma_missed_experiences_and/,"Religious trauma, missed experiences, and interfaith marriage","I love my wife deeply, but we might be nearing the end of the road. We parent well together, communicate well, resolve conflicts effectively, support each other's careers, enjoy each other's company, and have a good sex life. But two issues are tearing us apart.

**First, religion.**

When we married 18 years ago, we were both devout Mormons. Four years into our marriage, I left the church, and it’s a conflict that can’t be resolved—she’ll never leave, and I’ll never go back. She’s progressive as Mormons go, which has minimized the friction. She’s fine with things like me drinking coffee or beer, and she respects my beliefs. 

But I carry deep resentment toward the church (and my parents). As a homeschooled kid, I had no friends, no freedom, and no exposure to life outside Mormonism. As the eldest child, I was neglected, parentified, and forced to support my parents' constantly having new children (10 in all). For me to have anything in my life that wasn't approved by the church meant hiding it or facing punishment. 

It still stings. I’ve spent years in therapy trying to address the anger, shame, and trauma, but it's a work in progress. Adding to this, my wife and I have an LGBTQ teen, and while my wife accepts them and has made peace with them staying away from the church, my wife's ongoing involvement in a group that rejects our child weighs on me. I worry that I’ll never fully heal until I can get the church entirely out of my life.

**Second, missed life experiences.**

Growing up, I was indoctrinated with a fear of “sexual sin"" and was not allowed to date one-on-one before my 2-year mission (at 19). So before I met my wife (at 22), I went on exactly two normal dates. She’s my first and only relationship, and I feel like I missed out on something fundamental by not having other relationships before her (or even dating anyone else). Ever since I left the church, I have tried to suppress the crushing, sinking feeling I had about it, but it won't go away. A couple years ago, I opened up to my wife about the feeling. Earlier this year, she suggested we explore opening our marriage.

We worked with a couples' therapist for eight months and agreed that I could date and, if the opportunity arose, have sex with other women. I was to keep open, honest communication with my wife through all of this. I thought we were clear that I would keep this cabined to an evening or two a week. It wasn’t about replacing my wife or bringing someone else into our home or relationship. It was about me confronting that sexual shame and lack of confidence that was instilled in me as a child. (It was also a symmetrical agreement, although my wife  has no interest in dating because she spent several years out of the church in her youth, dated normally/healthily, and had several other boyfriends before me.) I got the green light, in consultation with our couples counselor, to set up dating profiles and go ahead with the plan.

Then a few weeks later, before I met up with anyone, my wife said she couldn’t handle it. She felt like I was rejecting her, that she was destined to be the loser, and that if I need to explore, we have to figure out how to separate.

I hate this whole thing. Mormonism already stole my opportunity at normal sexual/relationship development. I hate the thought that I can’t reclaim any of it without losing the love of my life. The church has already taken my parents (who have rejected me for leaving the church), and now I feel like it's taking my wife too.

Should I just give up and confront the pain of separation and divorce from someone I love?

**TL;DR** Mormonism stole my childhood, and now it’s taking my chance to heal within my marriage. We love each other. We enjoy being around each other. We have all the mechanics of a good relationship. But religious trauma and the crushing sense of the life I missed because of it are making the marriage seem impossible.

Also, note: I have no interest in comments from Mormons telling me that I just ""misunderstood the gospel."" I know what I was taught and the effect it had on me. That you might have been taught something else is irrelevant here.",1,1733086218.0,marriageadvice,0,1.0,False
1h4d5oj,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1h4d5oj/help_choosing_an_espresso_machine_for_my_lunch/,Help Choosing an Espresso Machine for My Lunch Spot: Linea Classic S vs. Altea Wood,"Hi everyone,

I'm opening a lunch spot soon where I'll be serving coffee, matcha, sandwiches, and pastries. While my priority isn't to be a ""coffeeshop,"" I still want to offer high-quality coffee with great beans. My location is near two well-known coffee shops in the city, so I’m unsure how much foot traffic my coffee offering will get initially.

I’m deciding between two espresso machines: the La Marzocco Linea Classic S (1 group) and the La Nuova Era Altea Wood (2 groups). The Linea costs around €6,000, while the Altea is €4,200, so there’s a significant price difference. The Altea has 2 groups, which seems like an advantage for efficiency, but it’s a single boiler machine, which makes me hesitant. On the other hand, the Linea has 1 group but is known for its reliability and quality. I also personally prefer the aesthetics of the Linea. I’ll be investing in a good grinder, so that’s not a concern.

Is it worth spending almost €2,000 more for the Linea, even though it has one less group? I’d love to hear your thoughts and any advice on whether the Linea’s quality would outweigh the Altea’s additional group. Thanks!

I couldn’t read or look at the screen, even the little light I saw in the other room was too much for my eyes. It’s weird because I couldn’t really tell if it’s a headache (I have vertigo and vestibular migraines) or if it’s anxiety or fear of side effects like seizure or corner side glaucoma, or if it’s a panic attack but with inability to relax eyes and head and face muscles. But anyway, I was laying in bed for the rest of the day, my eyes were so painful, like I couldn’t keep them closed and had to force my muscles to do it otherwise the light would be too much. I was thinking what caused it and found that for the past 4 days I restarted having coffee. And for the past 2 days I was having 2 cups a day. I’m pretty sure it provoked whatever it was. So then at night I couldn’t get asleep and finally came to the conclusion that it’s an anxiety and not a seizure or glaucoma, and took some low Thc high cbd oil drops. Wow!

1h4d39b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h4d39b,I wanted so desperately to believe. I was a Mormon. ,"Spencer grew up immersed in the Mormon faith, surrounded by the teachings and traditions that defined his childhood. Born into an intensely religious family in Michigan, he was the quintessential believer—faithful, devoted, and utterly convinced of the church’s truth. For him, the church was perfect, unchangeable, and divinely guided. He couldn’t imagine leaving.

But life has a way of challenging even the strongest convictions. A seemingly minor update to the For the Strength of Youth pamphlet—changing strict rules into mere recommendations—sparked his first questions. What was once enforced as unchangeable suddenly felt arbitrary. This initial doubt set Spencer on a path of deeper inquiry, leading to decisions that would ultimately change everything.

Today, Spencer is on the other side of that journey. His story is one of courage, loss, and discovery as he transitioned from a life of absolute certainty to one filled with freedom and possibility. Spencer’s reflections on faith, family, and the search for truth invite us to consider the beauty of questioning and the transformative power of embracing uncertainty.

---

I was born into an extremely Mormon family and attended a small branch in Michigan for the first 17 years of my life. I didn’t have many friends who were Mormon but that didn’t stop me from believing as strongly as I could that this church was God’s perfect church. I was the last person you’d expect to leave the church. I blessed the sacrament every week. I genuinely enjoyed doing missionary work and tried to get my friends to come to activities. There was literally nothing more I could have done to believe harder. I said on multiple occasions, “I couldn’t leave the church even if I wanted to”. I was a Mormon.

My parents were very strict about the “no dating until 16” rule that was, at the time, clearly spelled out in the For the Strength of Youth Pamphlet. The first time I had a single doubt about whether or not the Mormon church was true was when the new For the Strength of Youth Pamphlet came out. In this new edition, they redid several sections completely. They now only “recommend” that you wait until 16 to start dating. So then what was it before? Was it doctrine? If I remember correctly you cannot change doctrine, and if this rule was not doctrine then what was it and why was it enforced? This led me to think about other things. Why is coffee off-limits? Why is swearing wrong? These things seem like small issues, and they are, but there were just too many tiny contradictions and loopholes that I decided to start researching the big things.

I finally realized that the difference between doctrine and policy is completely arbitrary and the General Authorities can really just say whatever they want with no consequences. So I kept investigating. The gospel topics essays are honestly what really forced me out. One thing that I’ve heard repeated so many times during my time in the church is the phrase, “Beyond our comprehension”. The church abuses this phrase. It is often used to cover up various pieces of history. Whenever there is a hole in the story it’s just easily covered up by, “we don’t know”. There are core doctrines that are believed with absolutely no verification at all. All these people going up to give a testimony saying they “know for a certainty” that the church is true are just straight-up lying to themselves. We just don’t know, and there is no way for us to know. I personally choose to be comfortable with that uncertainty.

The central foundation of almost every believing member’s testimony is feeling the holy ghost. To be quite blunt about it, you aren’t special. Everyone on the planet experiences this feeling. It’s some sort of feeling of cosmic ecstasy that everyone feels for some reason, or for no reason at all. I still feel it after I left the church. All of it, whatever it is, is purely psychological. It is only because of the culture that we interpret these experiences differently. The LDS church uses something not unique to the LDS church as proof that the LDS church is the one and only true church. I live the best life I can and I hope to be favored in whatever happens after this life. If I strive to be the best person I can be outside of the church and God punishes me for that, then that’s not a god I want to be worshiping anyway. If what the Mormons say about God is all true, then I hate the guy. God would never treat his children this way. If he did, then he is not the generous forgiving perfect god that I was taught he was. If God is real, I think I’m doing just fine.

I had been finding things out about the church and I was really struggling with my faith. I wanted so desperately to believe. The thought of living without the church left me feeling helpless and I would have given anything for it to be true. I got a strange feeling. You know the feeling when you are in a bad situation and the holy ghost tells you to avoid that and get out? Well, that’s the exact feeling that I got, against the church. The feeling didn’t go away. I couldn’t even pray without getting this unnerving feeling that something was seriously wrong with this religion. As soon as I began to consider, “What if I’m wrong”, it became so obvious. I had to get out. A few days later I told my parents what I was feeling. They were clearly upset but eventually decided that I was old enough to make my own decision and that they would treat me like an adult. That took a huge toll on the relationship with everyone in my family, and due to that, life became so hard for a few months after this big decision. The relationship with my family has since recovered. I know deep down they want me to come back, and deep down I wish that they would be able to see the world through my eyes. Life is so much more beautiful once you are out, and I wish there was a better way to communicate that to the people who are still stuck inside.

“Never take counsel from those who don’t believe” – Russel M. Nelson. This is actually a major reason for why I questioned the church so much. The treatment towards ex-Mormons is insane. The church dehumanizes you so much. Addressing the above quote from Nelson, how terrible is that? He claims that nothing we say can be trusted because we have seen information that didn’t come from the church. My own family has been advised against trusting me. That’s enough evidence right there that they are getting worried about keeping members. I would argue the exact opposite. Seek out the counsel of people who are against what you believe especially, so that way you actually are educated enough to make your own choice. Ah yes, a choice. There is no choice. They give you the illusion that there is one, but it’s either you choose to believe and stay in the church, or you are wrong and you are a terrible person. Because of my different beliefs, I am not trusted. It’s dangerous to be spending time around me if you are Mormon because clearly my sole purpose in life is to drag people away from the church and ruin their lives.

Leaving the church is so unbelievably hard. I had my first existential crisis in my senior year. My family treated me differently. I didn’t have anyone to talk to either. I was the most alone I had ever felt in my life. I was so stressed about figuring out my future that I almost gave up on it completely. The months following my departure were the hardest in my life and I wish there was a way to make active members understand that. Instead, I’m just told that I’m a lazy learner and that all I needed to do was try harder, then I would still be in church. New converts rarely last more than a year. They’ll find out that the Disney version they were taught in the 3 weeks before their baptism wasn’t everything. As the world and internet grows, it gets harder and harder to hide the truth from the members. I have hope that one day everyone will leave. Then everyone will finally be free.

I’m still the same person I was when I was a member. I can’t help but tell people what I believe to be true. Life has so much more meaning once you leave. I don’t really know how, but knowing less makes what you do know, seem even better. The only thing I know for sure is this life, and I plan on using it to its full potential. I don’t know what comes next and yeah, it’s scary, yet more powerful than anything I experienced in the church. I’ve discovered that, by using philosophy alone, any religious claim can be argued back into ambiguity where it belongs. I’m not an atheist. If anything I’m Agnostic. There’s just as much of a chance that there’s nothing as there is that we just don’t know what it is. I choose to acknowledge that there may not be any meaning at all. Yet it doesn’t matter in the slightest. I like trees, rivers, mountains, animals and rocks. Those are cool. Trampolines are fun. There are those moments when it’s been cold and cloudy for a while, then you walk outside on a 60-degree day and the warm sunlight hits your face and it’s the greatest feeling ever. Music is the single greatest human creation. Really any sort of art is amazing. People are fantastic. It’s fucking brilliant really. This is what I live for.

There are so many things we just don’t understand about this world and what’s beyond it. Not only do we not know, we can’t know. Something as abstract as an afterlife is not possible for the human mind to fully understand. There is no denying that we truly do not know anything. All that religion is doing is taking a guess. I respect that. We as humans have an innate desire to make sense of everything. Religion is just a way of fulfilling that desire. What I’m not okay with is a religion stating that they are the one and only truth and everyone else in the world is deceived. I would make the decision to leave millions of times again if given the chance because it’s one of the few choices I don’t regret making. I don’t need a god to tell me if something is good or not. Even if he’s real, I can see the beauty of life. I may not have a clear purpose in my life anymore and that thought was scary at first. If I left the church, where would I go? The answer: Anywhere. Everywhere even. I am not limited to anything now and I have the choice to experience it all. I can finally learn and live and see the world as it really is. An ethereal mystery, and it’s fucking beautiful.

She slept on the couch and I slept on the floor. In the den were my 17 year old sisters birthday balloons that were still pretty inflated and kept in the corner with the chair. I was sleeping next to the coffee table and around 2 am I woke up to the balloons above my head so I put them back into the den in the corner. I go back to bed and give minutes later the balloons were in the doorway, so Instead of putting them back in the den I put them in the sewing room, didn't turn any lights on didn't take them to the middle of the room just put them by the door. When I was walking away to go back to sleeping on the floor the door started rattling so I ditched my friend and went to my room. And in the morning I went to the sewing room, the balloons dead center of the room under the fan, and the fan light was on, no other lights in the room just the fan. So I grabbed a pair of scissors and popped the balloons. ",1,1733086014.0,scaryeddie,0,1.0,False

Need Advice on Reading the Vibes,"Hey Reddit, I’m a girl currently studying in Germany, and I’ve got a situation I can’t quite figure out. Maybe y’all can help me decode this!

So, I met this German girl in my program who I think is super cute. She seemed reserved at first, but after a bit of effort, we hit it off. The same day we started chatting more, she even offered to show me around campus, which felt like a nice gesture.

Since then, we’ve had lunch together a few times, and one day, I casually mentioned wanting to visit a nearby city. I asked if she’d like to join me, and she immediately said yes, adding even though she had been to that city a couple of weeks ago and had already seen everything I was planning to check out.

We went on the trip, and honestly, it was amazing. We talked about everything under the sun, from light topics to heavier ones like politics and history. At one point, I decided to subtly let her know I’m into girls (mentioning that being gay is a big deal for me since it’s illegal where I’m from). She didn’t react negatively—she just acknowledged it and moved on, which was cool but also left me wondering because, normally, gay people I’ve met tend to elaborate on the topic if they’re also gay.

After the trip, I texted her saying how much fun I had and that I’d be down for more adventures. She replied warmly but said her schedule won’t allow for another day trip anytime soon. However, she did suggest we could hang out at local spots like museums or coffee shops instead.

Now I’m stuck. Where I’m from, going on a day trip or to a museum one-on-one with someone feels like a sign of interest, but this is Germany, and I have *no clue* about the social norms here. Add the complexities of lesbian dating, and my brain is doing gymnastics trying to figure out if she’s just being friendly or if there’s something more.

I’m happy to just have made a friend, but I also don’t want to misread the situation and embarrass myself later. For my LGBTQ+ folks in Germany (or anyone who’s navigated this kind of scenario): is this just normal “friend behavior” here, or could there be something more?",8,1733085957.0,AskAGerman,18,0.63,False

Making our first family trip to CR next spring, staying at a VRBO in Playa La Islita. First, I would welcome any information about that area. 

What CR airport will we use? (flying from NC) 

We would like to visit the Arenal area during our trip, possibly spend the night there since it's quite a ways from PLI .. any suggestions on lodging / tours?

Best coffee tour in the PLI area? Or should we tie that into an Arenal trip?

Should we rent a vehicle or use Uber / public transport? Other than our trip to Arenal, I do not expect we will venture far from ""home"" during the trip. Just local stuff.

1h4cxhm,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1h4cxhm/315p_let_me_love_you/,315P... LET ME LOVE YOU!!!! ,"So, i have no interest most of the offerings from Origin, the 100 series is okay, but it doesn't really speak to me, and aside from the 100 and 300 series everthing is just an exercise in boring, shiny excess. The the 300 series... the 315p specifically... that's another story. It was youtube videos about the 315p that made me pull the trigger on this game, a little pathfinder, that i could see myself climbing into, pointing at the sky, and seeing what's out there. I bought a Mustang Alpha starter pack and a CCU to the 315p at the same time, and soon discovered that while it delivers a hell of a box, and got me from A to B in style, it wasn't quite the all arounder i thought it was going to be, and thus began rhe chain of melting, upgrading, throwing just a little more money at the game here and there, and four years later i am (subscriber fees included) about $50 from hitting that concierge level. And while i have bought and melted, customized, and gotten a handful of cups of coffee from the 315p a few times since early 2020, it's never stuck. 

With the 4.0 wipe coming, like many others i have decided that i am going to ignore almost all of the ships i own, all but one. I want to do the tuitorial, head to my starter ship, and build a fortune. Despite the copious hate for it, i LIKE the Intrepid. No, it's not as fast as the 300s or as heavily armed as the Titan or my beloved Tana, you can't get a vehicle into it, but if we're being honest i can count on one hand the number of times i have taken out a land vehicle other than a Roc. The Intrepid checks the boxes for me; while not the prettiest girl at the ball, it's got a hab i could legitimately live in, it'll cross the Stanton system on a tank of fuel, ease of cargo access if you just want to tote the standard 8scu, but able to hold 21 single scu boxes if you are dedicated and brave enough to cram them in there, and it'll let me do box, bunker, low level bouny, and light hauling missions, along with a side of hand mining if i feel like stretching my legs.

Those easy to access cargo grids though, that's where i will plant the seeds of my empire. Running micro hauling missions until i can afford a Hull A in game. The down side is that i am stuck with choosing missions that involve 1 or 2 scu boxes, but today it hit me... the 315p holds 12 scu, can hold 4 scu crates, and it does it in drop down cargo platforms that are just as conveniently accessible!!! YES!!! THIS IS IT!!! THIS IS THE TIME FOR ME AND MY PLUCKY LITTLE PATHFINDER TO TAKE ON THE VERSE TOGETHER!!!! or so i thought. 

I slid over to the convention center today and rented a 315p, gods it is as beautiful as a remember... sleek, sexy, and just aching for a paint job and a coffee maker. I dropped those cargo decks, and the 4 scu crates fit like the 315p had been waiting all its life for them to come up that cargo elevator. The verse was our chicken burrito and we were ready to take a bite! after a couple successful runs i opened then mobi again to find myself another soon to be satisfied customer, and lacking options that offered 4 scu crates i took a job hauling 11, 1 scu crates. That's when the shine came off the apple. For some reason the single scu crates really didn't like sliding in next to one another, it took a few attempts to get each set of two properly seated, but, we made it happen. Little did i know that that was the easy part. 

UN-wedging those 1 scu boxes was more problematic than getting them in there. it took me about 20 minutes to get the first nine out, and another twenty to pry free that next to last box. It scoffed at the tractor rifle, laughed out loud at the ATLS, and snidely mocked the multi tool as repeatedly latched on to and released the crate, trying to wiggle it to freedom. Yes, it finally worked, but i had completed one delivery in the time it has been taking me to run two or three in the Intrepid. 

I thought it might have been a matter of the 315p and i just not being what the other needed until today, some relationships fail not because the love isn't there, but because the timing isn't right. Now though, i'm beginning to think that the 315p and i just aren't meant to be together. Sure, we can hook up and have a little fun once in a while, but as much as i might wish it were otherwise, we just don't seem to be destined to go the distance.

Maybe it was just a fluke, maybe my tractor rifle just wasn't performing like it should be, i'm told it happens to a lot of Citizens. Maybe the 315p just wasn't ready to let go of those boxes, maybe  she's too clingy for quick turn around hauiling. I don't know the answer, and the 315p isn't talking, so while i'm going to give it another shot, i feel like the 315p is destined to break my heart once again.",6,1733085604.0,starcitizen,6,0.88,False

I know this shit's going to be mandatory from May or something and I've been putting off getting started because it just seemed like a whole ""thing"" that would cause problems. I've started doing it and have gotten into the routine fairly quickly, it's not a problem and I actually really like it.

I throw my food scraps/coffee grinds/egg shells into a Tupperware box in my freezer so the scraps never get smelly as they accumulate. Prior to this, they'd be stinking out my trash can to high heaven - especially in the summer. This is taking stink out of my kitchen area and probably making it less attractive to critters. When my Tupperware box is full, I take it down to the compost bin in the yard and empty it. It's great having a nice clean trashcan that has nothing but innocuous trash in it. 

Anyway just thought I'd relate my experience in case any of you have noticed these brown bins appearing in your building and wondered what you're supposed to do with them. Give it a go, it's easy, it'll make your kitchen smell nicer and it's good for the environment.  ",32,1733085297.0,nyc,17,0.85,False

Scheduled landing was 10pm, all good.
A few hours before the short flight, it was delayed by half an hour then another twenty minutes (pretty much an hour).
Right before my flight they ring and say they're on the fence about picking me up. I suggest coffee.

Landing in at 11pm, I get message saying they don't feel safe to drive.
I absolutely bawl my eyes out as they haven't given me much notice, they know I have anxiety and didn't give me enough time to get a back up option.
They know it has already been a stressful weekend as several of my friends went to hospital.

I download a rideshare app, and it's inflated to over $50 for a 15 minute trip.
I start walking home (airport buses don't run until 5am), an hour in I realise I'm not getting anywhere fast and give up. Ring their mobile phone, ring the landline (with loud ringtone) several times, even try to set off all the automatic appliances in an attempt to communicate with them.

Get home a bit after 2am, after prices go down to $19. Sleep on couch. Wake up 2 hrs later to get ready for work.

I may be overstressed but I trusted them to pick me up, I communicated the change and then last minute they cancel on me.
Trust is already fraught in the relationship and to be honest I don't want to get married to someone who cares so little.

1h4cnfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1h4cnfi/i_got_an_obnoxious_passenger_fired/,I got an obnoxious passenger fired.,"This is a long one but it was the best revenge story of my life so far.

I'm a South African living in japan and I took my japanese wife to meet my parents and have a honeymoon in South Africa. 

On the first of three flights back to japan was from joburg to Qatar. We take our seats and get settled in. I noticed that lot of the passengers around us were wearing the same t-shirts (some kind of pharmaceutical company) 

As soon as we got settled in, I noticed that the woman and two men Sat behind us were also employees of this company. As soon as they got settled in, I noticed she (lets call her Brandy) was quite chatty, loud and a bit obnoxious. But, I am a nervous flyer so at the time, I was more worried about the take off, than her. 

So I put my earpods on And woosh. We take off for our 8hr flight to Qatar. As soon as the seat belt sign switched off, Brandy started ordering brandy and cokes for herself and her 2 coworkers. As each drink came Brandy's voice got louder more obnoxious. After drink number 6 the topic of her conversation turns to relationships. By this time half the cabin could hear their conversation about how she disapproves of interracial relationships. Even I could hear her through the gutteral screams and face melting guitar riffs of Meshuggah blasting through my earpods.

Then it happened. A nice woman sitting on 4 seats to her left quite loudly says 'mam, could you please quiet down. You're a bit loud and I am trying to get some sleep. I heard it too, so paused the song and took out my left earpod to excitedly eavesdrop. Brandy was not happy. She says 'excuse me, this isn't a nighttime flight. Haven't you heard of earplugs? And then jumps straight back into her conversation. 

The tension in the air immediately changed. In that moment all the people who heard the interaction caught eyes with each other and we all knew this flight was about to get interesting. About 20min later a flight attendant comes and politely asks Brandy to quiet down a bit. She begrudgingly agrees, orders another round and quiets down. But, it only takes Brandy about 30 min to get all the way back up to a volume louder than the jet engines roaeing outside the windows. 

Then another Chinese woman from the other side of the cabin gets up and walks to where Brandy is sitting, and in her best attempt at english says 'please be quiet, my child keeps waking up because of you'. Brandy looks up and u shit you not, asks this Chinese woman in very mispronounced Chinese 'can you speak Chinese?' (I'm fluent in Chinese so I could understand what she was trying to say)
And just kept repeating it until the frustrated Chinese woman went back to her seat.

By this time both flight attendants for our cabin were very much aware of Brandy's sassy nature and decided to close the bar for the whole cabin, which pissed me off cause I was hoping to enjoy a few more whiskeys before we landed. 

A few minutes later I hear sound of shuffling then plastic and then the faint sound of what sounds like the cap of a glass bottle being cracked open. Then the sound of liquid being poured into cups. Yup, Brandy had opened her bottle of duty free brandy she bought at the airport. And once again their conversation began to crescendo.

Now, the whole time I had been spectating the Brandy situation, I wasn't really paying attention to my wife who I assumed was sleeping next to me. I then saw my wife pull one of her earpods out turn to try and get a look at Brandy through the crack in the seat and then turn to look at me with a face I rarely see my wife make. It was a face of pure rage and frustration. I snapped. Now usually I'm. Not the kind of person who likes to cause a scene but I decided that I'm not going to let this asshole of a woman ruin my wife's flight.

So like a crazy person, I stood up and announced loud enough that the entire cabin turned to hear me 'excuse me everybody. Can I please have all of your attention. By show of hands who of you would like these people to shut the fuck up? About 30 passengers all around us raised their hands. I then turn to Brandy and just point say 'look. Understand? Shut up!'

I sat back down to the sound of applause from all the passengers that were raising their hands. My wife was shocked that I did that, but I told her that I did it cause I could see that Brandy was beginning to bother you too. She gave me a hug and the flight attendant that saw what I did brought my a cup of 'coke' but slipped me 2 of those little bottles of whiskey. 

Thankfully, Brandy and the gang then passed out and were quiet for the rest of the flight. So my wife and I could relax. But, Brandy wasn't finished. And now she had a new target, me. 

On our decent, Brandy awakes and decides that she wants to play some cards on the entertainment screen attached to the back of my seat. Trying her best to hit the buttons hard enough to make my seat move. I teach kids for a living so I know that she is behaving like an angry toddler trying to get a rise out of me, so I ignore her. 

We land, the plane taxis off the runway and everyone starts getting up to get off the plane. As soon as I get up and she sees my wife and I she starts repeatedly insulting me about my weight and how I married an Asian woman because I can't get a real south African woman blah blah blah. Highschool bully level bullsgut. I just smile and nod my head at everything she was saying and exit the plane. Finally Brandy and her coworkers walk off and my wife and I find a nice Cafe to have a coffee and chill and stretch for a bit before we make our way to the next boarding gate for our second flight to Malaysia. 

We eventually get to the gate and low and behold, guess who's also flying to Malaysia? That's right. it's Brandy. Shes standing by the gate window taking selfies and doesn't notice me. I find an empty seat next a guy wearing the same pharmaceutical company t-shirt and say ' excuse me sir, that woman over there with blonde hair taking selfie, what's her name? He asks me why and I say that she looks like someone I used to go to high-school with but I wasn't sure and didn't want to make an ass of myself asking her directly. He tells me and I say 'oh then it's not her sorry'. 

I thank him and for the remainder of the wait at the gate, logged into the airport wifi, found there company's Facebook page and website and sent a detailed recount of Brandy's behavior being sure to include all the colorful things she was talking about with her coworkers.

The next 2 flights back to Japan we're uneventful and got home safe and sound. 2 weeks later I get a reply from the CEO asking me for my number as he would like to talk to me about what happened. He calls me and profusely apologizes for what Brandy put us through. 

Turns out that by the time Brandy landed in Malaysia the CEO had seen my message, changed her return flight back to south africa for the very next day and fired her at arrivals in jhb airport when she got back. 

I bought a bottle of Brandy and coke on my way home from work that day to celebrate with my lovely wife. ",1038,1733084893.0,pettyrevenge,56,0.95,False

Ended up telling me he lied about his feelings for me and told me it’s over. How can I fix this?,So my bf and I have had a very rocky relationship. I thought we always tried again because we did want each other. We were fighting about two months ago and he messaged this girl asking for a threesome with her and her friend.( two girls he knows would hurt me and one was an ex) and also told this girl that has lip injections he wants to feel them on him. Seeing these messages hurt me so bad and we did fight over it. I’ve been very insecure since. He apologized said I had every right to be upset and he really tried talking to me to make me feel better. A couple weeks go by and it’s still bothering me. One night I sent him a picture of me in a thong hoping he’d know I want him. He messaged back a dry message saying I look cozy lol so embarrassing. Made me feel like shit because I seen how he talks to other girls. But I don’t cause a fuss. Couple nights later we are drinking and I’m laughing and joking while playing Xbox and that was annoying to him which I can understand it would be annoying trying to make everything funny. But it hurt my feelings so I laid my head down and got quite while tears ran down my face. I felt like he didn’t wanna see me laugh so he took it away. He apologized and eventually we went to bed. The next night we were drinking again and I started bringing up him talking to that girl and he apologized a lot and tried to make it better and I just would not drop it. I think just feeling hurt everyday over it and being mad at him and keeping that to myself that when I got drunk it just poured out. He had an awful night with me because I wouldnt stop and I do feel bad and I am sorry I did that to him. That night he said I love you that’s why I’m trying to make it better. But now he told me he lied and he doesn’t love me. And I fell asleep on the couch and he came over and kissed my head and said night and I felt him and woke up and kissed him back. He does this if I’m already sleeping sometimes I’ll feel him kiss my head goodnight and if he didn’t love me why would he do this knowing there’s a chance I wouldn’t wake up and feel it why act like you love me while I’m asleep and i may not know. It all hurts. The next morning I got up off the couch and went and laid in bed with him and we cuddled and kissed and he told me he didn’t feel good he felt hung over. I made breakfast for us and when I took it upstairs I said I made you breakfast and he said awesome your the best and we ate together. When we were done I brought our plates down stairs and we were both downstairs he started raking me over the night before which he had every right to. He was loud and being angry and said you wanna talk about it today and I said okay but this isn’t talking this is you yelling at me and he said okay we won’t talk at all get out of my face. I was sitting across the room. I go downstairs he’s yelling things at me and I come up stairs I yell at him and he tells me to leave so I did. Then he’s calling me yelling and then hanging up. There was no talking. He even called to yell at me for leaving the leftover crust from breakfast on the plate and raked me for always leaving left overs. I see his point here I should have thrown it out. Bad habit of mine. Later he told me he only gets breakfast and a coffee made if we have a bad night. I always ask him if he wants me to make him a coffee. Always. But breakfast I never make but I didn’t make it to try and make up for the night before I made it because he said he didn’t feel good and I thought I’d make him something to eat so he didn’t have to while he wasn’t feeling good. Later that day He broke up with me now and told me he hates me and that he lied when he said he loved me and it was all an act he pretended to like me because he was scared I’d fight with him. I have no idea what to do I left work today because I was crying. My stomach feels sick. I’m hurting so much and he’s just good like he’s okay with me gone I never meant anything to him. I just want it all to be not true and he just said them hurtful things to hurt me because he’s mad. I do love him very much,1,1733084733.0,relationship_advice,12,1.0,False

M/40. I've had LC for almost 9 months and it's been the worst 9 months of my life. I was very healthy and athletic before coming down with a *mild* case of Covid (no cough, no fever). I now suffer from PEM, terrible headaches, dementia (problems remembering and communicating), neck pain, heat intolerance, and insomnia (very low amounts of deep restorative sleep). 


Like many of you, I've thrown everything at this. All sorts of vitamins, supplements, red light therapy, brain retraining, acupuncture, massages, fasting, Nicotine patches, LDN, quit coffee+cannabis, etc. I'm able to manage the symptoms, but I still can't jog or lift weights. I feel better today than I did 5 months ago, but I'm still a shadow of my previous self. 


I have no proof of this, but I believe that there's some remnants of this virus in my body, and while it's probably benign, my immune system wants it out. 


I'm speculating here, but I think anybody who caught Covid has some benign viral 'crap' floating around, but for some of us, our immune systems are in a hyper-response, and we can't turn it off. 


Does that mean that all these vitamins, antioxidants, etc are actually *counter* productive? At this point I want to modulate my immune system, not strengthen it..?



Here's what I'm taking:



Mon/Wed/Fri:


- 3 in 1 pre/pro/post biotic, Fish oil, coq10, Thorne multi vitamin, vitamin D, vitamin C, NAC, probiotic, NAD+, Black seed oil (3x a day) 


Tues/Thurs/Sat: 

- Bromelain, Nattokinaise, Curcumin  (the ""spike protein detox"" formula) 


Everyday:

- Tirosint (I'm hypothyroid), metamucil, stool softener,  melatonin, LDN


Considering: stopping NAC and starting Lactoferrin instead

Also cycling a few weeks with/without nicotine patches (I stop NAD+ when I take nicotine). 


TL;DR - I feel better than I did a few months ago, but nothing is helping me return to my baseline. I'm questioning if spending hundreds of dollars every month on treatments is worth it.",11,1733084708.0,covidlonghaulers,6,1.0,False

**Summary**

I recharged 1 Quart (2 lbs) of [Silica Gel Desiccant Beads](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01I5Y2DG6) inside their printed ABS containers organized in the [SUNLU FilaDryer S4](https://www.sunlu.com/products/sunlu-filadryer-s4) using the **PC** temperature settings (70 C) set for a nine (9) hr runtime. I sifted through beads in all the containers and found only a few beads which had not completely turned to the dehydrated color (i.e. orange, in this case); but all those beads had started to mostly turn colors. I count that as a solid success.

**Equipment**

I have two Bambu Lab AMS units which I've printed a number of desiccant bead containers in ABS to ensure dry filament while stored in the units; including:

\- [AMS Desiccant Box Sets](https://makerworld.com/en/models/573428) with Hydrometer

\- [High Airflow Spool Desiccant Holder](https://makerworld.com/en/models/179426) for each spool used in the two AMS units

\- [AMS Desiccant Trays](https://makerworld.com/en/models/23215)

\- [Desiccant Dryer Ferris Wheel](https://makerworld.com/en/models/73654)

In all, these containers held the full complement of the 1 Q of Silica Gel beads I purchased. I bought the Sunlu S4 during the Prime Day sales -- knowing that I really needed to recharge the beads soonish -- and of course to dry filament spools. Mostly, I was turned off with the microwave- and oven-approaches to the recharge process and had read that using a filament dyer would work. The Sunlu seamed attractive because it circulates that air flow inside.

**Process**

The highest default temperature setting that the [SUNLU FilaDryer S4](https://www.sunlu.com/products/sunlu-filadryer-s4) had was for **PC** filament at 70 C (158 F) -- it may be possible to set it higher manually (i don't really know). The Silica Bead packaging indicates that an oven should be set to 200 F - 250 F to rehydrate -- but I didn't want to break my dryer just yet.

I chose the nine (9) hr runtime arbitrarily (set it manually over the 6 hr default setting) -- mostly because I was going to bed...and I find its a bad example for the kids to wake up and run immediately to the 3D printer to see how my prints went (because Christmas, you know). So, take an hour to wake up, eat breakfast, and have a coffee...then run to see how it went!

So, not very scientific, but the results were good. And, at least you can use this as a baseline to get started.

i get the vibe that he want to take me out to restaurants & stuff but knows he’ll get judged for going out with a young woman if he’s not clearly providing. how do i slowly transition into making him think i wouldn’t go out with him & take him seriously in public unless he’s providing more financially? it feels like he’s priming me to only accept the kind gestures, but we both know that ppl will side eye him & pity me if he’s not providing financially. 

based on his description he’s not into traditional gender roles/expectations, so idk if i can use misogyny to convince him to provide in a different way",2,1733084210.0,SheraSeven,1,1.0,False

I'm going to number the points I'm going to talk about below because this is the second time I've tried to write this, the first time was while I was trying to finish a class assignment and suddenly I left the Reddit app on my phone and I f\*\*\*\*d up .

1. I've been taking Atomoxetine for a week and in a few days  I'll increase the milligrams.
2. I take the medication because I'm studying something completely different than what I studied before (I'm 29, going back to study (web dev)) and I want to be focused and not waste time. According to my psychologist (she's been with me for 10 years) I have ADHD and that's why I have anxiety and OCD at my worsts moments. I'm not hyperactive physically, but I am mentally, my mind never stops.
3. I started my classes in September and I was taking Concerta/Methylphenidate, it made me very nervous and anxious and that's why I'm now taking Atomoxetine.
4. Now the anxiety with Atomoxetine is like continuous and when I get up I'm fine, when I take it with breakfast/coffee it comes back. My question is, am I the one who is more stressed because of my classes or because the medication is like that? Maybe I shouldn't take it or should I wait until February?
5. Does it happen to you when it's special dates that your anxiety or existential thinking gets worse? I feel very bad when it's winter or summer and I see that I'm privileged, I have a good family, a wonderful boyfriend and good friends, I don't have economic or social needs and I try to do the best for everyone, but I feel bad when I know that there are people who are bad or don't have what I have, in short, existential problems.

1h4cb58,https://www.reddit.com/r/raypeat/comments/1h4cb58/ray_peat_tier_list/,Ray Peat Tier List,"**Ray Peat Sphere Tier List**

Inspired by u/learnedhelplessness_.[Alphabetical list and review of every metabolic substance I have taken](https://www.reddit.com/r/raypeat/comments/15mtuvt/alphabetical_list_and_review_of_every_metabolic/).

Note: Some of these substances were never endorsed by Peat but are commonly discussed in Peat spaces and forums.

These are substances I’ve tried during my short year of ""Peating"" that helped me go from being a stressed, unmotivated university student struggling in many areas of life to living a fit, happy, and vibrant life, without the anchors that come from bad health. Combining these with a stimulating environment and good dietary choices did wonders. Without further ado:

# Thyroid

By far the best thing for my health. It raised my temperature from 36.4°C to 38.1°C in just a few months. The effects are noticeable across almost everything and it stimulates my appetite more than anything else. - **10/10**

# Cyproheptadine

The first Ray Peat substance I tried. It makes me feel like a zombie for a whole day but absolutely nukes my serotonin. Social anxiety, awkwardness, and overthinking were basically cured with just a few milligrams of this. The only drawback is I don’t want to take it too often because I know the day after will be sluggish. - **9/10**

# Progesterone

I take around 2 mg once a week, two weeks on, one week off. I don’t feel much from it. I made it myself using progesterone powder and vitamin E, which might affect the results. Not much to say, honestly. - **5/10**

# Pregnenolone

I use StressNon, applied topically to the navel. It’s a very effective mood booster and makes me feel great. It’s powerful for reducing stress and helps with sleep too. The downside is that if I use it daily, the effects diminishes and higher doses don’t do much compared to low doses.. - **8.9/10**

# Carrot Salad

Helps with bowel movements, though I can’t say for sure cause I usually drink coffee shortly after.. I have it about 4-5 times a week and get a slight temperature boost after eating it. It’s easy to prepare and tastes good. **7.5/10**

**B Vitamins**

Mainly thiamine, B6, and niacinamide. I’ve tried these in different forms, brands, and protocols but felt almost nothing from them. Thiamine occasionally makes me feel slightly sharper, but the effects are inconsistent. **6/10**

# Androsterone

Strong anti-stress effects. It makes me feel more stoic and masculine, but also slightly more aggressive. It also makes me sleepy sometimes. Would rate it higher if DHT didn’t exist. - **7/10**

# DHT

I took 1 mg nasally mixed with DMSO and vitamin E. All the positives of Androsterone without the sleepiness. It’s like a suit of armor for my stress responses. In situations where I’d usually panic, I felt calm and positive instead and could almost feel it kicking in. It lowers estrogen and reduces gooning urges. Didn’t notice much in terms of body changes, but this was a game-changer for me. - **9.5/10**

# Test Base

Used around 6 mg. It made me hornier and slightly lifted my mood. My balls shrunk a bit but went back to normal a few days after stopping. Not many mental or physical positives only used it because I was worried DHT might lower testosterone. - **6/10**

# Methylene Blue

Absolutely nothing but some bad side effects, even with just a few milligrams. - **2/10**

# Bromocriptine

A strong, consistent mood booster that makes mundane tasks much more enjoyable. It also helps with motivation. The downside is that it makes you a bit too aroused, and the nausea is awful even with food. Would’ve been a 9/10 without the side effects but with. **8.5/10**.

**Aspirin** \- Good effect makes skin slightly more yellow for the day after. Could be detox effects - 7/10

# Bonus: Semen Retention/Never Gooning

A few weeks of NoFap has a noticeable energy and mood boost. My temps are slightly higher when using a thermometer and I feel ‘purer’ which is hard to describe. I don’t know how Peaty this is and have heard releasing it can eliminate some toxins but will continue with it for now. 9.5/10

1h4c961,https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1h4c961/do_you_work_hard/,Do you work hard? ,"MOD, remove if you feel. Won’t be offended….this is a little airy-fairy ....or a lot. 

 

The other day, I found myself at a McDonald’s, watching the staff in action in the kitchen. It struck me how relentless their work is—they’re constantly moving, , and keeping the operation running like a well-oiled machine. By the end of their shifts, they must be shuttered!

At my work, I often listen to calls from our customer support desk, and I’m consistently amazed. These people are not only friendly and knowledgeable but are under constant pressure. They navigate tricky customer interactions while being monitored by KPIs that measure everything—call response times, time off calls, break schedules, and more. It’s a high-stakes, high-energy environment, and they excel at it. Honestly, I don’t think I could do their job.

 

In contrast, I work in product management and data. My workdays look very different. On Sunday nights, I’ll skim through some emails to ensure there aren’t any fires and I will plan a few things I need to get out. I’ll stroll into the office around 9 AM, grab some coffee, and chat with a few colleagues. My morning might involve reviewing reports, attending some (often pointless) meetings, or analysing numbers but realistically I am not working before 10am. Delivery in my role is much less immediate—it can take months to see the impact of changes—but I do keep a close eye on my metrics.

 

If I were to break down my role, it’s probably 80% communication and 20% actual delivery. I take plenty of coffee breaks to think, and Fridays tend to be fairly chilled. Of course, there are periods where I’m putting in long hours and genuinely earning my keep, but for the most part, my work feels relatively relaxed—meanwhile, those in the call centre are busy working their asses off in the metaphorical coal mine!

 

And yet, I earn significantly more than they do. Sure, I can justify it to some extent. My decisions can influence substantial revenue outcomes. I also bring a somewhat rare combination of skills: data analytics expertise, domain knowledge, strong communication abilities (though you might not guess it from this post!), commercial instincts, and political awareness \[not even good at politics but I know when to keep my mouth shut!).   
  
I probably could maybe do their job while they would struggle in mine…but man…does that justify the income difference? I suppose that the system we are in…and look....I am not becoming a communist here but I do feel for them. You can say “well, they can study to progress or some other “anyone can do it” but it does feel like the cards are staked against them?"".  They must be exhausted when they get home, and now they need to better themselves after giving their all.  
Do you know if this resonates with anyone?
