I'll be getting my aligners in a couple of weeks. I have had some exposure to aligners through my partner who used Smile Direct Club before our wedding. I've also read through the FAQ of this sub and some posts. 

Where I am now:

My dental hygiene is pretty good at this point. I use a water flosser and brush twice a day. I also just upgraded my toothbrush to OralB IO.

I bought an Isonic DS180 ultrasonic cleaner since it'll benefit my wife and I. 

I'm somewhat prepared for aligners, but I'm wondering what other things I should be preparing for? What changes can I expect? Any new habits? I know there are rules around food and drinks that will take getting used to. I love coffee, but will I need to do cold brew through a straw? 

Thanks in advance for sharing your experiences and learning.",1,1748902177.0,Invisalign,0,1.0,False

r/wayofmen.

Over the last 8 years (barring a few months during the COVID period), I’ve been actively traveling across India’s Tier-1 cities, coaching men on dating and social dynamics.

Naturally, this has given me a unique, on-the-ground view of how different cities rank when it comes to dating women. Please note, these observations are based on broader patterns—not every nook and corner of each city.


Bangalore

Bangalore used to be a great city for single men—until mid-2023.

I first visited as a coach in 2018, and have been consistently active there since 2019. For several years, the city boasted solid demographics. Cafés like Third Wave Coffee and Starbucks often had an excellent girl-to-guy ratio. UB City was always buzzing.

But something shifted in late 2023.

Today, finding a venue with a healthy, engaging vibe and a good gender ratio takes real effort. In my view, Bangalore is now the toughest city for men to meet and date women. The competition is high, and the margin for error is slim. That said, the city still holds potential—but only for men with sharpened social skills.

Rating for the average guy: 5/10


Pune

Pune is my favorite city to coach in.

Why? Because certain areas in Pune—like FC Road, Koregaon Park, and Viman Nagar—have a striking girl-to-guy ratio, sometimes close to 7:3.

Just walk around, and you’ll notice it. The energy here is younger, more welcoming, and more receptive to men. The vibe is far more encouraging for guys looking to experiment with their social skills.

Granted, it’s not the place to go if you’re searching for a wife—the crowd tends to be younger—but for developing and refining your dating game, Pune tops the list.

Mumbai

Mumbai is home for me, so my lens is a bit more personal.

That said, Mumbai is a green flag city for socializing and meeting women. It offers something for everyone—whether online or offline. From casual café meets to more upscale social experiences, Mumbai delivers.

But here’s the key: Mumbai is built for a more refined, posh social scene. It’s the only city in India that consistently offers this at scale—and does it well.

As a coach, I find Mumbai to be easier than most cities—provided my clients aren’t intimidated by the elite vibe of some venues we visit.


Delhi

People often lump Delhi and Gurugram together, but I see them as two distinct experiences.

Delhi city is far superior in vibe compared to Gurugram. You’ll find more attractive women, vibrant cafés, stylish cocktail bars, and well-frequented clubs. South and Central Delhi in particular offer a great gender ratio and consistent flow.

Khan Market is unmatched—it’s possibly the best social hub in the country.

Now, are Delhi girls less open compared to other cities?

Yes, to some extent. Social expression here is more guarded and conditioned, but that doesn’t mean unwelcoming. It’s just a different calibration.

One thing I’ve personally found challenging is the presence of families everywhere, which subtly influences the social atmosphere—something I don’t experience as much in other cities.



Gurugram

Gurugram is… okay.

In my opinion, it’s overrated. While the infrastructure and venues may seem polished, the social vibe doesn’t live up to the hype. In fact, I would rate Bangalore above Gurugram when it comes to meaningful dating opportunities.


Final Rankings (Based on Experience & Social Vibe)

1. Pune


2. Mumbai


3. Delhi


4. Bangalore / Hyderabad


5. Gurugram



> Note: These rankings reflect a broader social calibration and energy—not the traditional cold approach scenes. The locations I frequent are different from the usual pickup spots.

1l1v74k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l1v74k/to_chase_or_move_on/,To chase or move on?,"So there’s a lot of context to this story, but basically I started dating my neighbour, only for a month, and we already had to revert back to being friends. I think this is because we are so close (live on top of eachother) that we didn’t have space to miss eachother, time to learn about eachother in a normal pace of time or plan things properly. It made me over think every step he took and probably him the same with me. We had a heated argument at a time through my window where I was expressing feeling hurt that I didn’t see him for a week. But instead of just saying I missed him, I kept my wall up and just asked if it bothered him - to which he replied ‘I knew I’d see you today bc you’re at home on Fridays’. :/

Anyway he didn’t get me and spoke over me so much that I actually slammed the window on him and walked away. Pretty lame I know. A few days later we cleared the air, I actually wrote down how I felt to him because he said he wanted to write me a letter some weeks back and I sort of encouraged him to speak it instead.

This guy was so nice to me. Brought me coffee, dropped me to the airport - some really nice things. But what bugged me was his lack to slow down and just be able to get to know me with time. It felt like he was in a rush. And because I wasn’t - this is what caused the imbalance and the arguments.

So now, we are back to friends. It’s been sort of awkward but sort of not. We had a really nice conversation the other day through the window, over the weekend, when I was washing my dishes and he was outside drying his clothes. He asked me if I get time outside of work to fulfil passions and that  I should give it time. I think it’s sweet - nobody really says stuff like that to me but is it the bare minimum? He’s also not usually my type but idk why I feel so drawn to him. Is it because we are neighbours?

I feel bad like I’ve pushed him away and he’s suddenly not as warm as I remember him to be. Although we’ve apologised to eachother and had a couple of warm conversations that are actually quite deep, I have the urge to do more.

He comes home from work soon. Do I approach him with a hug and say I just wanted to say I missed you or just wanted to see you - hope you had a good day, goodnight? Or do I do nothing? Is the arguing so early on a sign that I should leave this as it is? Or is this something that can be rectified? He might even be seeing someone else now who knows. Help please I want some opinions :)",1,1748901989.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1l1v6qi,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1l1v6qi/i_used_to_have_a_schedule_i_had_to_follow/,I used to have a schedule I HAD to follow,"By the time I was 23, I was having my 3rd baby. I had my kids at 19, 22, and 23. My ex-husband and I didn't divorce until later, but he was very rarely around and he's only been employed for maybe 5 or 6 years of the last 23 years, so I was always the one supporting our family and I was almost always a single mom. 
I used to get up every morning at 5:30 and sit on my patio to read and have coffee and cigarettes (now I vape lol) until 6:30. Then I'd get myself ready before getting the kids up at 7:30, getting them ready and out the door by 8:15 and dropped off at school by 8:30, before heading to work by 9am. I did this every single day for YEARS. 
I was diagnosed with adhd as an adult at 32, 9 years ago, and I've been taking prescribed meds for the majority of that time. But even in the last few years of my kids being in high school, I'd get up at the last minute to drive them to school before coming home to get ready for work. 
Now, my kids are all adults. My oldest and her bf live in a different state, my youngest is in a different part of our state going to college, and it's just my middle daughter living at home. I've really been struggling, for years at this point, with getting up in the mornings to get ready and start my day. 
I wish I could get back to getting up at 5:30, but it doesn't matter how many alarms I set, I'll snooze them until they stop and I just fall back asleep. If I have to work I'll do the bare minimum to get ready, waking up with barely enough time to get out the door when I need to. 
If anyone has any tips or tricks that have worked for them, I'd love to hear them.

1l1v63u,https://i.redd.it/2cnnrqtb7l4f1.jpeg,Ministry of Scent Sample Haul,"Well, I went a little wild purchasing samples from Ministry of Scent! I don’t blind buy fragrances and I also wouldn’t call myself a collector by any stretch of the imagination; I have some designer and some niche, but only 3 full bottles of fragrance, and I stick to samples and travel sizes until I know for sure that the fragrance works with me as I go through seasons of life. My preference is to buy scents that evoke a mood over finding a signature scent, and I am that person that will wear a heavy gourmand in the summertime because I love it, sorry y’all! 

For reference, I live in San Diego, CA (US) so weather stays pretty even until the dead of winter or the dead of summer when it swings to the extremes. The three bottles I own are **Philosykos** by Diptyque, **Angels’ Share** by Kilian, and **Valaya Exclusif** by Parfums de Marly. Travel sizes I wear regularly are **Burberry Her Elixir** by Burberry, **11:11 Azure** by Lake & Sky, and **Black Saffron** and **Super Cedar** by Byredo (I layer them).

I’ve been wanting to try Kerosene Fragrances for a hot minute—spoiler alert, I loved almost all of them. **Promises, Promises** was the only one I’m a little meh on as it smelled like a Catholic mass to me. Everything else? I die with how good they are. I was born in 1984 and **Summer of 84** just blew me away, especially as a gourmand lover. It’s a citrus aquatic: grapefruit, lemon, bergamot, melon, white flowers, fresh water, musk. Drool. **Followed** is a flanker of **Follow**, both are coffee scents but maple is added to **Followed**. I feel like **Follow** is what REPLICA wanted to do though it lacks the lavender note and is a straight up “punch you in the face” coffee. 

My wildcard scents were **Blackbird** by Olympic Orchids and **Choux Choux** by LIIS. Y’all, **Blackbird** is purple and is the most incredible jammy scent. I went to fruit heaven! Bonus is the price: $65 for 30ml EDP. I want to try more! All I got from **Choux Choux** was coconut, like sunscreen, and I’m not a fan of coconut. There is no coconut note either 😂 so glad I bought a sample!

BORNTOSTANDOUT was a hit for me as well; **Drunk Lovers** has something nostalgic about it…there’s a masculine cologne aspect to my nose that makes me remember long lost loves. It’s pretty fucking sexy to be completely honest! Actually…all three are super sexy. It will be hard to choose between the three as they are similar in ways (the cognac and rum notes, for sure). I could have ordered a few more scents from this brand but samples were out of stock unfortunately. 

Let me know if you would like the notes of any! I’ll definitely be buying **Blackbird** and **Summer of 84**, it’s a toss up on **Follow** and **Followed**, and BORNTOSTANDOUT scents!",2,1748901922.0,FemFragLab30plus,1,1.0,False
1l1v4rg,https://www.reddit.com/r/OT42/comments/1l1v4rg/jenna_gives_details_about_falling_out_with/,Jenna gives details about falling out with Sterling,"Jenna did a fourth video continuing her story about her family. She says she cut her brother Justin out of her life after he called her publisher and complained about her book because she didn't want to have him come in and out of her children's lives.   
  
She didn't want him creating a bond with her kids and then disappearing. Jenna says Justin already hurt her son that way when he was about 2 years old. She didn't even hear from Justin when her daughter was born, she says. ""As far as I was concerned, that relationship was done,"" she says.   
  
Jenna says it had probably been five years since she had spoken with Sterling. She talks in her previous video about arguing with Justin about her dad, Ronnie. Justin stopped talking to her at that time and so did Sterling, she says. ""He may have texted me when my book came out and said something nice about it,"" she says, adding that she probably could have reached out to Sterling during those years and he would have answered. But they were not close and weren't talking then, she says. He was living and working in another country for a long period of time.   
  
After about five years, Jenna says, she was talking with Shane, a friend she had grown up with. He suggested that she give her relationship with Sterling another try. Shane's brother and sister were still in Scientology, Jenna says, and he didn't want Jenna and Sterling to feel the pain of being disconnected from each other if that wasn't necessary.   
  
When her daughter was 3 or 4 years old, Jenna reached out to Sterling and he said he would love to talk or get together. They were both going to be in London at the same time and Sterling said it would be fun to meet up. Dallas was working but Jenna and the kids agreed to meet Sterling at the Portobello Road Market. Jenna says she told her kids on the way there that they had another uncle and his name was Sterling.

Jenna says their meet-up with Sterling at the market wound up being really nice and they spent the next few days together. ""He helped us with transport. He showed us all around town,"" she says. ""... He was really, really sweet with the kids. He bought them gifts. ... It felt like I had lost one brother but maybe I was gaining another one.""   
  
Sterling wound up moving back to the United States, she says, and he came to live in San Diego with their mom for a few months while he was finding a new job. ""Dallas and I got him a job so he could make some money while he was waiting,"" she says, adding that she and Sterling spent a lot of time together then. They would go out for coffee and go to the gym together. Sterling then moved to Los Angeles, but they still stayed in touch and went to visit him at his house. Sterling would go back to San Diego for Christmas and other holidays.   
  
She says Sterling had a passive-aggressive streak and he thought it was funny to buy her kids life-sized Darth Vaders that had motion detectors and would yell things out when she walked by. That scared the shit out of her, she says. He also bought her daughter an enormous teddy bear that took up a lot of space in her room. ""When I had to get rid of it, I was like a murderer,"" Jenna says. ""... I guess it was all in good fun and it was sweet and my kids loved him.""   
  
During that time, Sterling wasn't talking to Justin either, she says, because he had decided that Justin was too much of an asshole to him and he couldn't take it anymore.   
  
In 2019, Jenna and her mom had a falling out, she says. When that happened, basically without a word, Sterling stopped talking to Jenna, she says. ""I never said anything bad to him about my mom. I never asked him to choose between her and I,"" she says. If there was something that he didn't like, he didn't even give Jenna the chance to explain herself, she says.

""Wow. This again?"" she says she thought to herself.   
  
Jenna says Sterling may have talked to her on the phone once during that time period when he told her that he was back in touch with Justin and he was spending time with Bitty. Jenna says it crushed her because Sterling decided to throw away his relationships with Jenna and her two kids in favor of a relationship with a mom who had basically ditched him as a child.   
  
""She wasn't his mom. She only took Justin. He did not call her mom. He called Barbara mom,"" Jenna says, adding that Bitty didn't love Sterling for who he was. ""She was always telling me she just didn't feel that bond with Sterling."" Jenna says Bitty would tell her that she didn't understand what was wrong with Sterling that he couldn't have a girlfriend. Bitty would ask her if Sterling was ever going to have a family and say she feels so bad that this is how his life is, Jenna says.   
  
Jenna couldn't care less if Sterling had his own family or not, she says, and she was glad that he was such a good uncle. Sterling's decision not to talk to Jenna or her kids anymore felt pretty unforgivable to her, she says.   
  
""It was about four years before I heard from Sterling again,"" she says. It was right around the time Jenna and Dallas separated and they hadn't told the world they were getting a divorce yet. Sterling texted them both, asking if he could come by the house to see them and the kids. Jenna told him he couldn't just show up and have it be like nothing happened because she had already had to explain to her kids why Sterling disappeared. She says she told him she would be happy to talk to him and figure things out with him.   
  
For several months after that, she says, Sterling didn't really reach out for them to talk. Jenna says she was busy with her divorce and had a lot of other things going on. She had gone on Aaron's channel to do an interview about her life, her divorce and what had been happening with her for the past 10 years, she says.

Sterling had also been popping up on YouTube around this time, Jenna says. ""Sterling never reached out and said anything to me about my divorce,"" she says, even though she got married when she was so young and the divorce was a big deal to her. She says she tried to get support from her mom during her divorce but her mom told Jenna that she was done with her. To read a recap of the video where Jenna talks about that, click this link.   
  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/SPTV\_Unvarnished/comments/1gn8ctt/jenna\_shares\_heartbreaking\_details\_about\_being/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPTV_Unvarnished/comments/1gn8ctt/jenna_shares_heartbreaking_details_about_being/)

Jenna says Sterling was showing up on YouTube and he was talking about having his twin, Justin, on his YouTube channel. A few days after Bitty told Jenna that she was done with her, Sterling had Bitty on his channel. Dallas told Jenna that Sterling had tried to contact him during a contentious point in their divorce ""which I thought was pretty strange,"" Jenna says.   
  
Sterling was also making some comments on his channel about how in his experience, the Ranch really wasn't that bad. Jenna says that was complicated because she had written a book telling the truth about what the Ranch was like. ""You are publicly speaking about Scientology for the first time and one of the first things you say is that it wasn't really that bad,"" she says. ""It felt actually kind of personal and it was pretty fucked up.""   
  
Some people say that two people can live through the same things in the same family and come away with two different experiences, Jenna says, but there are some things about the Ranch that are objectively true. None of the kids at the Ranch lived in a home with their family, she says, and that alone makes the Ranch the horrible place she says it was. Jenna lists off a bunch of other things that made the Ranch a very negative experience for children. Jenna alleges that there were many cases of older kids sexually assaulting younger kids at the Ranch.   
  
""This was never about me and Sterling just seeing things differently,"" she says, adding that if someone doesn't see the problems with the experiences Jenna described at the Ranch, they might still have the mind of a Scientologist. Jenna says Sterling is gaslighting people when he says that he sees the Ranch in a different light because he tries to look at things in a more positive way and he's an easy-going person.

Jenna says she's not perfect but that what she wrote in her book about the Ranch was absolutely true and it was also the nicest possible version of it. She says her own brother made offhanded comments that made less of the true stories that she told. ""That was fucking not OK with me and it was insidious and tricky,"" she says. ""And it was all done under the guise of being nice and kind."" Sterling's attitude pissed off a lot of people in the ex-Scientology community, she says. ""It wasn't just me.""   
  
Aaron had been doing a lot of content with Sterling before she and Aaron started seeing each other, Jenna says. Sterling started asking Aaron to do things like have Bitty on his Growing Up In Scientology channel and to stream Sterling and Bitty's Thanksgiving together, she says. ""It was a little bit awkward because Aaron and I were seeing each other,"" she says. ""Out of respect for me, Aaron didn't want to have my mom on because we had had a falling out.""   
  
It became a point of contention between Aaron and Jenna that Aaron and Sterling were friendly. ""They would talk pretty regularly and it was just hard for me to deal with all of this,"" she says, adding that she decided to talk with Sterling and figure things out or at least tell him how she felt.   
  
Jenna says Sterling told her that he was going through a personal crisis when she and her mom stopped talking. It was too much for him to bear, she says, because his parents, Foster and Barbara, are still in Scientology and they don't talk to him. Sterling told Jenna that he shouldn't have stopped talking to her, he feels bad about it and he's sorry. He told her that he really wanted to have Jenna and her kids in his life and that it had nothing to do with YouTube or Aaron, she says.   
  
Sterling told Jenna that he hadn't known Bitty had told Jenna she was done with her before he had Bitty on his channel. He also said he had no idea that any of his comments about the Ranch were upsetting to Jenna, she says. Jenna says she decided to be understanding and remember that she can't control what other people say. Sterling also told her that he hardly talked to Justin at all and that he had really strict boundaries with his twin.   
  
Jenna says she decided to give her relationship with Sterling another try whether that makes her a stupid person or not. She had just lost her marriage and her relationship with her mom, she says. Jenna didn't have the same expectations of Sterling that she had with Justin, she says, because they didn't grow up together and Sterling didn't owe her his love and friendship. Jenna didn't want to have an enemy, she says.   
  
""For the next year, Sterling was back in my life and back in my kids' lives,"" she says.

If you’ve lived long enough with someone like Stephen, there’s a chance you have PTSD or C-PTSD. Howdy friends, welcome to the club! We eat our feelings and are hyper aware of threats and red flags in daily life. 

So on that front … in addition to “touching the poo” (meaning engaging directly with Stephen) I see many people posting and commenting here frequently, and many people noting that they’ve DM’d Laura with the latest crazy video or just up-to-the-line vague threat. 

Stop doing that. It’s not helpful for her, and it’s especially not helpful for you. 

My fellow Stephen-esque survivors, if you’ve lived long are doing this, this may be a part of PTSD/C-PTSD called hyper vigilance. Hyper vigilance is our brain’s way of ensuring that something horrible doesn’t happen to us again. That seems great, right? Sort of, except when it makes us feel like we have some amount of agency or ability to stop the terrible thing from happening again. 

So we scan, and scan, and refresh, and refresh, and try to warn Laura that there’s been another post and OMG DO SOMETHING ALREADY!

I don’t personally know Laura. But I’m guessing she has social media assistants, lawyers, friends, and family who are all keeping watch for her. She likely has the funds to pay for private security, and in a situation like this, it wouldn’t he unusual for the police to do regular drive-bys of her house upon request. 

This is to say, she probably has it covered, and the constant DMs and messages are likely making it more difficult for her to find peace. 

For us, those recovering from our own Stephens, engaging in hyper vigilant behavior trains our brains that this is super normal and cool behavior and we should totally keep doing it. Every update is a dopamine hit. See! Threat! Risk! I knew it! He’s doing shitty stuff! 

Stephen is going to do shitty stuff, and we as internet strangers can’t stop him. 

Take a walk and leave your phone in your pocket. Get a physical book and go read it in a coffee shop. Call a friend. Go play with cats at the humane society … whatever gets you to put the phone down. 

Take care of yourself. Know that Laura likely has this covered. And the Stephens of the world are going to Stephen no matter what strangers on the internet thing.

1l1uz0l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l1uz0l,"SDR vs HDR, Working Luminance, and Export Settings for s-log3 --> YouTube. Pure confusion, advice welcome.","Hey everyone, editing some footage captured on my A7IV and FX3.

Was moving along nicely, color grading and such, when I found ""working luminance"" in my timeline settings which caused me to take a huge step back (and have an existential crisis).

First, I have to say, this is NOT a question about monitor accuracy. I'm on a 2021 M1 MacBook Pro 14"". I absolutely understand this is not a fully-calibrated display, and because I'm only making YouTube content at this time, I'm okay with my footage not being an absolutely perfect 1:1. (I'm an audio nerd, and understand the need for transparent monitoring — I'm just not there, budget-wise yet with video).

Anyway — Resolve 20 defaulted to HDR 1000 when I set up these color management settings. To the best of my understanding, I have my Sony Slog3 Cine automatically being processed to Rec.709 in the timeline. I like working this way so I don't have to convert every single clip with a node, and I also get tired of previewing footage in log. 

However, this is where my comprehension ends.

Moving down those settings, I decided to change working luminance to SDR 100, and HOLY smokes it changed the color cast, brightness, tones, etc COMPLETELY. I guess that's expected, but it opened up a can of worms — should I be editing in an SDR or HDR working luminance? 

Which one is more ""accurate"" to what my final product will look like, if I'm editing for YouTube as my footage's final resting place? Do most folks have an HDR-enabled display these days (iPhone, newer Mac/iPad, etc?) or should I still be editing in 100% SDR for YouTube/social media?

I'm also wondering about ""graphics white level"" and how this effects the whole process/settings.

Can someone help set me straight with some ""set it and forget it"" color settings for my use case? Thanks so much for helping untangle my brain. Not enough coffee today.

Technically about an ended relationship I still want to try and revive, or at the very least make peace with.

I want to offer her an apology, and ask if she would be willing to consider reconnecting in a low-pressure manner such as a coffee or just a text and starting there.

What I'd like advice on, and what I'm having trouble deciding, is how to best go about this, or if I even should (for her peace). I was considering a letter or a text, but I'm not sure if I'm blocked or if she would even read a letter. While I could knock on her door, I genuinely don't know how she would take that - there was never any abuse or anything like that in our relationship, but it would still be her ex of several months knocking on her door after a significant period of no contact. I've written an apology letter already, and received feedback from my therapist that it's heartfelt and good, if a bit long, but I just don't know.

The rest of the stories can be found on this [masterpost](https://old.reddit.com/r/AstroRideWrites/comments/mgv92s/mieran_ruins_collection/).*

Life wasn’t easy, being dichromatic. The makeup budget was miniscule, and Larry had resorted to odd jobs to support himself. He learned how to sew to create the proper costumes for a mime. Although, they were always a size too big for his body which was impressive in the grand scheme of things. The worst part came when he had to make certain requests.

As the classic book said, everyone pooped, but everyone also had to pee. It came unexpectedly, and it demanded to be unleashed onto the world quickly. Depending on the individual’s diet, it could often smell just as bad. Larry found himself in the unfortunate predicament of having to pee while all the bathroom doors were locked. 

The sign nearby stated that a janitor was inside cleaning. Yet the city hall didn’t have a janitor. All the work was handled by Becca and Larry himself, and they didn’t have a sign. It also wasn’t in the past few budget requests although Evelyn never followed them. 

Larry knocked on the door, but no one answered. He turned the knob, and it didn’t open. Looking around, he began to shove his shoulder in the door. He felt ashamed of breaking the rules, but this was an emergency. The door wasn’t thick, but Larry was a weakling. He fell backward with an extremely injured shoulder. In desperation, he ran around the building looking for the other bathrooms. All were being cleaned. 

Under normal circumstances, he would have realized the bizarre situation. There were eight restrooms in city hall, and there wasn’t a single janitor. Also, janitors would never clean all the restrooms at the same time unless they were feeling malicious. His sense of caution was overruled by his body’s needs. He fled to Evelyn’s office where she slept behind her desk.

Mimes normally abhorred sound, but Larry banged his fist on the table. Evelyn awoke slowly and glared at Larry. She was annoyed by his presence normally; this was amplified by the fact that he interrupted a lovely dream. Larry still had standards and described his predicament in motion.

“What kind of stupid dance is that?” she asked. Larry considered the standard potty dance beneath his talents. Instead, he was moving his arms to simulate running water then diving. He held his breath to symbolize a full bladder. Then, he shook one hand in a flushing fashion.

“I have no time for charades. I have to prepare for an important meeting with the…” Evelyn paused for a moment. “Town mother.”

Larry continued his gestures knowing Evelyn’s falsehood. Evelyn rolled her eyes. 

“Go bother Derrick or Becca with this,” Evelyn said. Larry sighed and began to dance in place. Evelyn nodded her head.

“Oh, you have to go pee. Then, use the restroom,” she said. Larry put his fists on top of each other and walked back and forth. “They’re being cleaned. Wow, Becca’s been busy.” Larry pointed at the mayor’s private lavatory. “Absolutely not. That’s my sanctuary.” Larry got down on his knees and cupped his hands. “No, find somewhere else.” Larry huffed and ran out of the room. A woman walked in after him.

“Sorry, I’m late,” she said.

“Who are you?” Evelyn asked.

“I am Rachel, the Town Mother,” she said. Evelyn blinked at her several times. 

“What on Earth?”

“I know it’s a weird title. Really, I represent the combined interests of concerned mothers,” she said. Evelyn shook her head. 

“That’s the last time I get specific with my meetings,” she said.

Larry ran outside city hall into the town square, and it was completely empty. The citizens of Ura avoided the town square because it smelled of asparagus. The reason was unclear, but it was not a pleasant smell. The shops and businesses nearby had extremely low prices to attract customers. It rarely worked.

A cafe nearby looked open, and Larry ran inside. A law of cafes was that a handful of people were always present nursing their coffee. They sat on the couches looking serious at anything to give the impression of profundity. The barista was in a constant state of annoyance about dealing with these people. As such, a mime appearing and doing a dance was not unusual. The barista assumed it was part of a bizarre performance art piece.

“You want to use the bathroom. Don’t you?” she asked. Larry nodded his head. “Alright, you got to pay for something.” She backed off to the side and gestured at the menu. All the drinks were overpriced and artisanal. In spite of all logic, the single black coffee was the most expensive. The owner had poor business sense.

Larry opened up his wallet and found a single coin that he found on the ground. It was also plastic. He presented it to the barista with a pleading smile on her face. She stared at it and considered every choice that led to this moment and shook her head. When Larry left, the serious people in the coffee shop considered the artistic implications of a mime having to pee really bad. Most pursued the philosophical and allegorical route. One realized the full potential for comedy that it had. 

Looking around, he saw many types of establishments. Yet he realized that all of them would require purchases before using their facilities. Why was money so important? Why wasn’t being  a mime a better paying job? Why weren’t there more public amenities?

A middle-aged woman approached him. She wore a yellow shirt and a red skirt with birds on it. Her hair had gray streaks and was tied in a bun. Her smile was sweet and comforting. She reached out a hand with three perfect nails and two chipped ones.

“I couldn’t help but notice you. You gotta pee?” she asked. Larry nodded his head.

“I live down the street. You could use my toilet,” she said. Larry ran away from her to find her house. He returned when he realized his mistake. The woman didn’t take offense and laughed.

“You’re funny.” She led him down the road to a quaint house that somehow survived the hollowing out of downtown. She put a key in the door and opened it. “Down the hall to the left.” Larry burst out running to relieve himself. While he was inside, the woman laughed again and locked the front door and the bathroom door. Larry didn’t realize the door locked from the outside because that’s just poor home design. If he had, he might’ve realized the danger he was in. Alas, the call of nature overrode common sense.

Hey there! I'm posting here because I’m obviously seeking a friend online but, I’d really love to find someone I can hang out with in real life soonish or eventually. I’m especially hoping to connect with other women, but I’m open to genuine connections with anyone who shares similar interests. However, don’t let that scare you away if we have differing interests. I’m pretty open to doing just about anything. 

I’m moving to Kentucky soon, so I’d love to meet someone nearby, or someone who’d be willing to visit (I’m happy to cover travel if it helps us connect).

A bit about me:

- Born and raised in Appalachia

- Big animal lover (I currently have cats, rabbits, and guinea pigs, must love animals!)

- Into gardening, landscaping, and casual woodworking

- I love survival horror and platformer games
Concerts, antique shops, aquariums, zoos, coffee shops = my happy places

- I love metal and I’ve even been in a few terrible bands. 

- Also into baking, fishing, Sanrio, theme parks, and spontaneous little road trips

- No smokers, please. Social drinking is totally fine. I'm just looking for someone to hang out with, share hobbies, talk about life, go to a show or explore a quirky roadside attraction. It’d be amazing to find someone to build a real friendship.

You could even reach out of your top floor's window and touch the wall of the building across the road from you, the buildings overhung that badly. This was until the great fire of London in 1666, as the fire's spread was helped by the fact that buildings basically made an arch over the road, and many were torn down and rebuilt as a result.

About six months ago, I ended a relationship that was toxic. I don't need to go into detail about that, because although my partner was abusive the narrative of blaming her for everything stopped bringing me comfort. I realize now that part of the problem is that I am a people pleaser and I have a very hard time setting boundaries. I have a hard time feeling like I'm letting people down.

I'm a 37 year old guy, and I feel like time is running out. I want to have a family. I want to have a few kids and build a life with someone. Best case scenario, I have my first kid within the next three years, I'll be close to 60 when they graduate high school. I've always felt about ten years behind in life. I didn't really go to college until I was 28, and got my first entry level job at 33. Since my breakup, I've gone on some dates. They didn't work out for one reason or another, and it just feels like the inevitable at this point. Match with someone on Hinge, talk for a week, ask to meet up for coffee, have them message me afterward with something like ""You're really nice but I don't feel a connection. Best of luck!"" And then start again with someone else. It feels just like going through the motions at this point, and I'm not even nervous to go on a first date anymore because I know it's not going to go anywhere.

Yesterday I had a second date with someone. She was honestly very sweet and very nice. But this time I didn't feel a connection. That honestly made me so sad that I had to let this nice girl down. I think this comes back around to me people pleasing and having a hard time setting boundaries. It's a perfectly reasonable thing to not want to date somebody, but I still felt guilty about it. I walked around my city after the date, just wandering the streets. I felt so down and depressed. My work is going okay. I'm hoping to get a promotion at some point this year, but I'm feeling a bit burnt out from that as well to be honest. So much work, so little time. Even though my life has come a long way I feel like it's stuck. I'm not working in a shitty factory like I was before I decided to go back to school. But then I feel guilty for not being grateful for life I have now. Like I should be working toward the next thing, but I don't really know what the next thing is.

I just would like some clarity on what to do. I’m open to any suggestions on how to navigate these feelings. The cycle that I’ve been on hasn’t been working.",2,1748900759.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1l1up7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbancarliving/comments/1l1up7f/getting_a_hot_meal/,Getting a hot meal,"Eating wraps and sandwiches can get pretty tiring pretty quickly.

I have a solar setup with a fridge but cooking hot meals is a major PITA in a vehicle. I've not got proper ventilation yet so everything inside stinks of whatever I end up cooking. I vacuum pack my clothes in my van, for this reason.

I've also tried simple cooked meals like noodles in a camping pot over a single hob camping stove with butane canisters. However, it's not easy to cook in a vehicle or find a spot to cook without having to worry about various things and it can just be uncomfortable.

Boiling water with a good thermos can provide hot drinks. I found my thermos to be one of my favourite items when I started to adapt to life on the road. I bought a 2L whistling kettle and use it to boil water for the thermos. I like to have herbal teas, coffee, and regular tea. Sometimes hot chocolate. These are all things which don't make everything smell like what you've been cooking/brewing. Smelling fresh and clean is a big morale boost. The thermos also gives me hot/warm water for a shave and it's really important to have good personal hygiene.

I recently stumbled upon an app called Too Good To Go. It basically has surprise meals that are discounted and have a pick up time. There are many hot meals on a budget. And the portion sizes are generally huge. I highly recommend for those who have taken to life on the road.

Even if you can cook, it can be a time consuming process. I've found that this app allows me to fit some more time into a packed schedule. I highly recommend people give it a try.

There's nothing like being able to have a hot meal before bed. But eating out is generally not an option for many due to the cost. As long as you are okay with having a bit of variety in your diet, Too Good To Go is a way to get a hot meal on the cheap. And there's usually enough to share as well.

My four basic cooking implements are:
* Bush pot
* Small frying pan
* 2L whistling kettle
* 1L thermos jug

I found I can cook a variety of meals easily with this on my stove. Utensil wise I have:
* Long titanium spoon
* Fork
* Butter knife

I've found these three to be all the cooking utensils I need to prep simple meals. Canned provisions with packet rice is really easy for a hot meal as well.

The fridge I use is the Alpicool P18 18L fridge. It's very power efficient and I've found a 1000Wh solar power station with a single 100W solar panel to be more than enough to keep the fridge running. This setup could fit in a very small space, even in a car. I drive a small van so I've got plenty of room for the refrigerator. I store milk and cold water, with some cheese and other small things like chocolate and a bit of fruit.

This is not a very structured post. It's just things I've picked up along the way.

For while it didn't bother me because he seemed like a sad and lonely man who needed someone to talk to, but it got really tiring and started getting a bad gut feeling from  him. 
Today when I was clocking in, my coworker told me that Jerry is causing problems in all the small businesses in town, and he asked another coworker who works in a different store what my work schedule was in summer. 
This just seems like a red flag to me. I don't care what a person wears or if they yap constantly to me, but asking where I'm at or when I will be at work does not sit well with me at all. 
I also found out he likes to watch middle schoolers walking by his house when school gets out and tried to get into an elementary open house for parents when he doesn't even have any kids. 
I'm asking if there is any advice on avoiding him or if I should tell my boss about the situation or maybe I'm being just crazy. I've told my mom and other people about him but I've always been told that he is a sad old man who doesn't know how to talk to people. I understand, but I think that he's pushing his limits.

I have owned many brands of guitars in my 20+ years of hobby playing mixed with a couple of years of coffee shop type shows...Alvarez has always stuck out as a value leader, along with Guild close behind.

*  Alvarez RD8 (my first ever guitar) $200 at the time with an Alvarez hard case
   * I'll never get  rid of my first guitar, but it does sound like a laminate top guitar. I set it up properly, years after moving on from it as my main guitar. So even though I don't play it often now, it is capable of being setup very well and still sounds good...for what it is.
* AP66 (the Artist series parlor) about $480
   * The solid top really resonates and the neck is so comfortable. Absolutely love this guitar.
* RF26 (selling new for around $250 - $300)
   * Now the sneaky one - I recently grabbed a slightly older RF26 off the local used marketplace and truly thought it had a solid top. I added a bone saddle, cleaned it up and gave it a setup. 
   * The OM body is very comfortable and its amazingly clear and resonant for an all laminate guitar. This one is entirely different than the RD8 and plays like a solid top guitar that has opened up. 

  
Summary; think the Regent series is fantastic and is a great beginner guitar. I know Reddit loves Yamaha and they do offer a solid top in the same price range, so can't argue with that. But some of the Regent guitars sound great, and jumping up to the Artist series gets a fantastic guitar. ",1,1748900718.0,AcousticGuitar,0,1.0,False

***World News Magazine, December Issue, 2048.***

Winter chill had seeped into the metal bars of the railing she sat on. Her fingertips were pink, squeezing the hem of her sweater sleeve. She was holding a cup of warm coffee in one hand, face obscured by the wispy steam rising from the cup. It smelled like petroleum and espresso there. The sky was dashed with the scarlet hue of the setting sun. Her feet dangled a few inches off the floor, an empty rusted can lay beneath the sole of her boot. She was humming a tune quietly to herself, waiting. They came like they always do, in a pair, two bright lights like starlight, falling quickly followed by a blinding glare. She covered her eyes, the snow amplified it, cast away all shadows and then it was gone. She uncovered her eyes and saw the two rockets descend onto landing bays, far on the other side of the coast, past the landfill and the scrapyard and the monolith apartment blocks with dirty windows. She liked watching them burn up, they looked like fireballs, she imagined what it would be like sitting inside one herself. If you had binoculars, you could just make out the word Starlancer I and II on either rocket.  
   She finished the last of her coffee, black smudges of soot and oil lingered around the porcelain surface as she packed it neatly into her backpack alongside a thermos. She pulled out a keychain from her side pocket, it had an old rocket hanging off it, one of those early twenty-first century relics comparable to old CRT monitors against the paper thin TV screens of today. She rolled the silvery oval holding the key along the length of her finger, her thumb ran down the familiar ridges, then she slid off the railing and walked back to her hoverbike following a path of footsteps she made coming down here. Carbon black matte with a single red stripe crossing over the back. Large halogen headlights bolted above a twin-engine set up, shiny chrome contrasted against the burned up ends of thrusters on either side of the body. She sat in the worn leather seat, slotted the key into ignition and turned it gently. The engine roared and the bike vibrated with the comfortable purr of a cat.",0,1748900607.0,writing,0,0.5,False

The Sexism: ""Even though many other shows were undeniably sexist, Star Trek made a point about women being equals to men, and repeatedly fell down on the job."")","WhatCulture.com: ""To modern eyes and sensibilities, there’s plenty about the original Star Trek which looks silly, hopelessly outmoded, or just plain dumb. Need I say more than “Brain and brain! What is brain?!”

But let's not pillory the whole series for the flaws of individual episodes. And I'm not talking about how the show looks almost 60 years outside its original context. Many of its failings are attributable to the relentless grind of time, the social conventions of the era, the vagaries of media conventions, fashions, and changes in film technology that affect everything from lighting, makeup, color, and optical effects. Yesterday’s state-of-the-art isn’t dumb, it’s just antique.

Let's look at the bigger picture: the stuff that spans multiple episodes, seasons, or permeates the show’s entire run. In other words, what’s dumb in the series as a series?

Don’t touch that dial and stay tuned as we boldly look at the 10 dumbest things in the original Star Trek. 

**10 Dumbest Things in Star Trek The Original Series**

1. The Sexism
2. Telepathy
3. Game Changers...Forgotten [Magic Technology]
4. Kirk vs. Computer [Again and Again]
5. Stealing the Enterprise

6. Swiss Army Spock - making Spock “better, stronger, faster…” to the point of absurdity.
7. The God Things [Apollo, Trelane, Organians ...]
8. The Dilithium Crystals
9. Perfect Parallels [Earth-like worlds]
10. Kirk, landing party of three. Kirk [Senior staff in the away teams]

Quotes:

""1. The Sexism:

Even though many other shows were undeniably sexist, Star Trek made a point about women being equals to men, and repeatedly fell down on the job. In the first pilot, both the clinical Number One and the fresh-faced Yeoman both fantasize about the Captain. Yeoman Rand fusses over Kirk, makes coffee in emergencies, and even feels bad for accusing Kirk after his evil duplicate assaults her. In “Miri” while they suffer from a soon-to-be fatal disease, she cries for Kirk to look at her legs, and when abducted, only asks “What are you going to do with me?” instead of using her wits to try to persuade her child captors or even to gather information.

Nurse Chapel is entirely defined by her unrequited passion for Mr, Spock. Yeoman Barrows has fantasies about a “no means yes” Don Juan. Marla McGivers lets Khan endanger over 400 lives and seize control of a starship capable of subjugating entire planets, all because she’s got the hots for men who “dare take what they want.” Caroline Palamas falls head over heels for Apollo and resists helping save the crew because it would break the Greek god’s heart. McCoy anticipates this, saying, “On the other hand, she's a woman. All woman. One day she'll find the right man and off she'll go, out of the service.” Ugh.

Spock’s no better, once saying, “And I suspect preys on women because women are more easily and more deeply terrified, generating more sheer horror than the male of the species.” Double ugh.

Hell, even the robots get in on the misogyny.

>NOMAD: That unit [Uhura] is defective. Its thinking is chaotic. Absorbing it unsettled me. [....] A mass of conflicting impulses.

And the series even ends on a sour note with the horridly misogynistic “Turnabout Intruder,” which is both too dumb and too offensive to waste time on here.

Sexism is beyond dumb, especially on Star Trek.""",1,1748900576.0,trektalk,0,0.6,False

1l1ukqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1l1ukqe/3_great_dates_easy_connection_then_sudden_silence/,"3 great dates, easy connection, then sudden silence + breakup text—what happened?","Went on 3 dates with someone who wasn’t my usual type, but the connection felt easy and grounded—like a healthy, slow-burn romance. After a string of intense/love-bomb-y situations, I was open to something more stable, even though a few things didn’t fully align. I was open and curious to get to know each other more, and hopeful that our differences may even be what leads us both to deeper understanding of one another, personal expansion and growth with new perspectives.

Some early flags:

* **Family/political values:** Our families had opposing views. He agreed with me privately but kept up a facade with his family, which felt misaligned—I’m someone who speaks up and lives my truth.
* **Work/lifestyle:** We’re in different industries and I’m usually drawn to creatives, but we connected over shared values and side passions. Because of other things like travel, food, film, music, spirituality, outdoorsy-ness in common didn't make that a dealbreaker for me.
* **Attraction:** I was affectionate and drawn in, but had some doubts because I didn't feel intense instant passion to rip clothes off. Still, I often grow more attracted to someone as trust builds. The one time we had sex was a bit brief and awkward, but I brushed that aside as first time can be weird with someone new, and in the past partners have surprised me with the 2nd time around how compatible sexually we are.
* **Depth/conversation:** Beyond our niche shared interests, he didn’t ask deeper questions or open up much. The spark faded between date 2 and 3, and his texts got noticeably drier.

Still, the synchronicities were wild—same niche music, obscure travel spots, aligned life goals. We both said it felt uncanny. We talked about being in a grounded chapter: no more chaos, just peace, partnership, and family. The last conversation we had was sharing baby names.

He pursued me hard from the start—daily texting, planning every date, thoughtful gestures (a gift from his trip, a surprise car picnic). Always picked me up, dropped me off, put band aids on my cut, really took care of me and joked that in a past life he was a grandma because he can't help but to take care of others.

* **Date 1:** Drinks and hours of conversation at his place
* **Date 2:** Dinner, movie, sex, sleepover, morning coffee
* **Date 3:** Picnic, movie, dinner, early drop-off (he had an early morning), no kiss

One thing that *might* be a factor: he’s working on a business project with someone I went on one date with years ago—someone who really liked me, but I friendzoned. We talked about it on our first date, and it didn’t seem like a big deal at the time… but who knows.

Then—radio silence. Three days later, I got a text saying it's been nice he didn’t see it going further. No real conversation about it.

I’m confused. Why initiate so much, build all that consistent, healthy momentum, talk future—and then disappear like that? He didn’t seem like a love-bomber. We both seemed self-aware, even cautious about repeating old patterns. I did notice his energy dip before date 2, but with plans already set, I thought it was just a pacing shift. We acknowledged early on we're both dreamers and love to fantasize, he talked about all these future plans he wanted to take me on... but again, didn't seem love-bomby, just slow consistent deepening that we'd eventually get to with no rush.

Anyone else experience something like this? Still trying to make sense of the abrupt change and what I can do differently in my approach with others. I'm trying to learn from my patterns that didn't work, but lately ""healthy"" seeming relationships are also not working.",1,1748900441.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

What you see here are layers of coffee syrup soaked almond sponge, chocolate ganache, and coffee French buttercream. It’s one of my favourite desserts, and is any coffee lover’s dream.

It's not been a success, I have been ghosted a few times when I have suggested to meet men face to face, I have been stood up once because I wanted a man to meet me at a coffee shop and not his house. I have met people who seem to hate women (we are all gold diggers apparently, but I had to remind them, in a nicest way possible, there ain't no gold to dig, mate), men who do not look like their pictures, and finally a man who had only seperated from his wife of over 20 years 3 weeks earlier, oh and she still lives in the house!🤯
I did some self reflection and thought of ways to improve myself so as to attract sane, normal men. Feedback from sisters, friends and work colleagues (I am taking them all on my dating journey), that is look too put together and that can be intimidating (say what!?!). Apparently I need to flirt more and give out signals to be approached. When I have asked exactly what that is, apparently I need to touch my hair more, smile more (which I do) and look less like i have things to do. 
I am a 45-year woman, I have no idea how not to look busy. Touching my hair is flirty? Dear Lord, I am lost! YouTube is all about confidence, well, I think I have that as I have a customer facing role at work. 
I have my professional life and kids all sorted. I am a feminine dresser and make sure I look good when I go out.
Is there an idiots guide to middle aged flirting and being approachable I can read? Can anyone recommend me something to watch as I am clearly clueless. 

Thought I would get this off my chest and ask, you wonderful people out on the Internet, please help a clueless romantic out. Throw me you advice and suggestions.

I've been out of the running due to injury on my arm, but the fast few months also haven't been great for those wanting to buy a PC - or a GPU in particular. As prices have been slowly going and stock going up, I'm hesitantly optimistic on making a new guide. Although it's far from where prices were, and with tarriffs going left and right, there's no telling where things will go, the Winter 2025 guide is now so out of date it warrants replacement.

# Before commenting, please read the following:

* I have been getting a lot of comments of people being confused what the lists are actually for, and how the parametric selections work on [PCPartpicker.com](http://PCPartpicker.com) . Please use this [flowchart](https://imgur.com/a/LL98lVI) to guide you through the website before commenting some frequently ask questions
* I want to reiterate that these lists are here to give you an indication on what you can **expect** for a certain budget; what kind of **value** you can get for your money with that budget. That does not only mean pure performance, but also features, expandability, and future upgradability. Some of these are hard to quantify in words, but I have tried my best through my own judgment to make some weighted decisions on each list.
* To give you an example, in the [$1100](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/NvDL4D) list I might recommend a Ryzen 7600(X) with an RTX 5060 Ti, 32GB RAM, paired with a 1TB SSD, and a relatively value-oriented case, cooler & motherboard. This is my vision of the best 'value' PC you can get, but if you have a different PC with a high end case with RGB, expensive cooler, and 2TB SSD, that is 100%, utterly and completely, fine! I just want you to have a **reference point**.

# Gaming PCs

|Budget|Note / compared to previous budget|Possible upgrades with leftover budget (in order of priority)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|[\~ $400](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=7TMhK8)|This is the cheapest gaming PC I can somewhat recommend. Do note that this PC does NOT have WiFi, and if you do need WiFi you need to either buy a WiFi enabled motherboard or add a (preferably PCIe x1) WiFI module. This PC uses the Arc A380 which is a pretty basic GPU.|A faster - but second hand - GPU like a used RTX 2070 (Super) or RX 5700XT. WiFi / Bluetooth capabilities on the motherboard, 1TB SSD, extra RAM (2x16GB)|
|[\~ $500](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=tT9MwP) (iGPU)|If you're planning on buying a GPU later on, or are only a very light gamer, this might be interesting for you. You're getting an AM5 CPU with 32GB of DDR5 RAM which means great upgradability in the future.  This list also ensures a fast Wi-Fi connection (as opposed to just wired Ethernet)|Ryzen 8700G (which has 8 cores and a faster iGPU). 1TB SSD.|
|[\~ $650](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=vfdkjX)|With $250 extra to spend compared to the $400 list, you're getting a huge upgrade, mainly in the form of the AMD Radeon RX 7600. As the stock and availability of the Radeon RX 6600, 6600XT, and 6650XT withers over time, the 7600 comes the more logical choice, even though it's quite expensive.  You're also getting 32GB RAM which is really nice to have in 2025.|My first priority would be getting a 1TB SSD. We have a motherboard that supports as least 2 M.2 SSDs, so you can also add another SSD later on. If you have the i5 12400F selected, you could get a DDR5 motherboard and DDR5 RAM for better longevity as DDR5 is continuously getting faster than DDR4 in games.|
|[\~ $850](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=D3NMwP)|We're making a few nice to have upgrades here. The Intel Arc B580 is a fantastic value GPU, though it's still too expensive to be added in more budgets. If you can find a good deal on an RX 6750XT, 7600XT4060 Ti (16GB), or 7700XT, I'd pick that instead.  We're also guaranteeing a 1TB SSD (finally), a much quieter cooler, 32GB RAM, a roomier case and a better quality power supply. The con of using the B580 with this specific build would be that the B580 really likes having more CPU overhead.|As mentioned, I'd prefer a 7700XT here if possible. A DDR5 motherboard + RAM is also a nice upgrade to make here. A better case would also be nice.|
|[\~ $1000](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=XfxzkL)|The main jump we're making here is in terms of CPU gaming performance, future upgradability, and DDR5 RAM. The Ryzen 7600(X) / 9600(X) are still the best overall value CPUs out there. They have fantastic gaming performance, a great upgrade path (to the 9800X3D or future AM5 socket generations), and are great to use. The starting price is a lot higher though, and we don't have a ton of GPU overhead anymore. I would love to add the 7600/9600 to lower lists, but that's hard to justify with current GPU prices.|You could 'future proof' the PSU to an 850W model.|
|[\~ $1100](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=NvDL4D)|Although the $1000 is a nicely rounded budget, I think that this $1100 list is a noticeably better PC due to the 16GB RTX 5060 Ti. Even though there's been a lot of drama on the 5060 Ti due to the 8GB variant, objectively speaking the 16GB version is one of the best Nvidia cards you can currently get in terms of value. With current prices that's not saying much, but it's something. All in all you're getting a nicely rounded PC|2TB SSD, dual tower cooler (like a Thermalright Phantom Spirit)|
|[\~ $1300](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=VZjzkL)|The AMD RX 9070 would be a nice upgrade over the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB. It's currently still a bit too overpriced, but would be a nice middle-of-the-road upgrade nonetheless.|Check the price on the AMD Ryzen 5 9600(X). If it's within $25 of the 7600(X), I'd upgrade tot that if you have the slack. 2TB SSD, dual tower cooler (like a Thermalright Phantom Spirit), higher end case.|
|[\~ $1500](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=TVZMwP)|Upgraded to the RTX 5070 Ti. If the 9070 XT is much cheaper, I'd grab that instead.|Check the price on the AMD Ryzen 5 9600(X). If it's within $25 of the 7600(X), I'd upgrade tot that if you have the slack. 2TB SSD, dual tower cooler (like a Thermalright Phantom Spirit), higher end case.|
|[\~ $1800](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=YtHHRB)|Upgraded to the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D for much faster CPU gaming performance, with the added bonus of a much beefier cooler. Also upgraded the motherboard to an ATX model with at least 3 M.2 slots and Wi-Fi 6E, and a 2TB SSD.|For $100 extra you could consider the 9800X3D. Also look into a higher end case.|
|[\~ $2000](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=yrP44D)|Upgraded to the 9800X3D and an extra 2TB SSD. Also clamped down the PSU to a more limited selection of premium brands|Higher end case, liquid cooling.|
|[\~ $2250](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=VQMhK8)|Upgraded to the RTX 5080.||
|[\~ $3000](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=PcvMwP)|High end liquid cooling, a higher end motherboard, double the RAM, a larger single SSD, a higher end power supply and a higher end case.||
|[\~ $5000](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=qJG8jX)|RTX 5090, an extra (PCIe gen 5) 2TB SSD, an even higher end motherboard, and top of the line power supply.|Anything you want!|

# Workstations

|Budget|Note / compared to previous budget|Possible upgrades with leftover budget (in order of priority)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|[\~ $850](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=rbfWf7)|Very fast and high quality Workstation without 3D acceleration. Although the new Intel Core Ultra CPUs aren't that interesting for gaming, with the reduced prices they're quite appealing for workstations.|If you want a 3D accelerated machine, you can add any GPU you like. For a high end (70-class and higher) you might want to consider a higher capacity PSU. If 2D is all you need but have budget left over, the Core Ultra 9 285K is a good upgrade too.|
|[\~ $1700](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=XwX66h)|Upraded to the Core Ultra 9 285K added the 16GB RTX 5060 Ti. This gives you a relatively large VRAM buffer that's nice to have for 3D workstation applications.|Extra RAM, more storage,  higher end case.|
|[\~ $3000](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=M9Q44D)|Upgraded to a 360mm radiator for CPU cooling, extra 2TB storage, an RTX 5080, a crap-load more RAM, and a much higher end case.  If you don't need such a high amount of RAM, you can remove a set, or even go for a faster set of 2x32GB if that's enough for you.|RTX 5090 if you can stomach it. Spend more budget on storage if you don't need the RAM.|
|[\~ $5500](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=ggmtQ7)|Changed to the Noctua NH-D15 G2 for ultimate air-cooling. Motherboard with Wi-Fi 7 and faster networking. Set of 4x48GB to guarantee stability over 2 sets of 2 x 48GB. More RAM. RTX 5090.  More storage. Titanium rated power supply.|Anything you want!|",2,1748900269.0,buildapcforme,1,1.0,False

After following the clues, Alex tells Mandy she is the Brown’s missing daughter.

**Wednesday, April 26, 2023: Abby Townson**

It was Alex’s day off, and he was shopping for some new office supplies. As he picked up some packs of computer paper, he saw a middle-aged man flirting consistently with a young girl and making her quite uncomfortable. He decided to help her out of the situation by pretending to know her quite well and attempting to rescue her.

“Oh, Hi! It is so good to see you,” he said. “Hi!” she answered with hesitation. “How are you?” he asked her. “I have been alright,” she answered quickly, trying to get away from the man. “Oh, umm, you know my aunt is here too. Would you like to say hi?” he said while guiding her away from the man. “Oh yes! Of course.” They walked in the other direction, and the man finally stopped following her. 

“Oh my God! Thank you so much,” she expressed. “What was he saying to you?” he inquired. “He asked if I wanted to go back to his place,” she confessed. Alex decided to stay with her for the rest of her shopping trip, through the checkout, and made sure she got to her car without the men following her again. 

“Thanks again. I am Abby, by the way!” “You’re welcome! I’m Alex!” he answered. 

The two new friends exchanged phone numbers, and Alex let her know that she could call him anytime. Abby got into her car, waved goodbye to Alex, and drove out of the parking lot.

As Alex watched her leave and get into his car, he saw the man following her in an old white pickup truck. Seth quickly started his car and began to follow him, and called Abby on his cell phone. She answered and said, 

“Hey, Alex! What is up?” “Abby! That guy from the store is following you in an old white pickup truck. Do not go home! Drive to the police station on Main Street, and I will meet you there!” he instructed her. “Oh, no! Oh, ok, I will see you there!” she answered.

Alex called the police station and informed the receptionist of the risky situation that was soon to arrive. Alex knew his way around town, knew a shortcut to the police station, and he got there first.

When Alex arrived, a group of officers was standing outside. Alex informed them of the description of the target vehicle, the suspect, and the young girl leading him here. The officers all took various positions around the parking lot and building, and Alex waited for Abby to arrive. He saw her pulling into the parking lot and parked her car next to his.

Alex carefully went to meet her at her car when she pulled into the parking lot, and he walked her forward towards the station. The suspect stepped out of his truck and slowly walked towards them. Alex noticed this and held Abby close to him tightly.

Out of the corner of his eye, Alex saw the man pull out a hunting knife. He grabbed Abby by the waist and shouted, “Knife!”

The other officers quickly surrounded the man, got the knife away from him, and arrested him right away. The man was taken to the station, and some other officers told Alex and Abby everything was all right. Abby hugged Alex tightly and thanked him once again for rescuing her yet again. Then Abby did the most surprising but simplest thing in the world. She leaned towards him and kissed him softly.

After the police reports were completed and Abby was finally ready to go home, she learned that Alex was the new police chief of this very police station. Abby was shocked but told Alex that it was destiny that he was able to save her from the dreadful man in the first place.

It was later determined that the man in question was Edgar Flotd, a serial rapist who has been on America’s Most Wanted list for the past twenty years. Now that he has been caught, they have to difficult task of transporting him to Texas to be held in a large, high-security prison to await trial.

**Wednesday, August 16, 2023: Zoe Carpenter**

As a nature photographer out on an assignment in the deep woods, Zoe Carpenter witnesses a man burying a body. She snaps a photo and quickly turns to leave. However, she trips over a tree root, and the man hears her fall. He drops his shovel to chase her. She ran from the unknown killer, going deeper into the woods. As evening comes, she finds a tiny, ramshackle hunter’s cabin and stops to hide. The ruggedly handsome hunter who catches her breaking in offers to help her. The man happens to be Alexander Young and radios to the station for backup. Reinforcements are due to arrive in a few days, and the man promises her that he will protect her.

**Friday, June 6, 2025: The Ozaki 8**

Agent Young sat at his cluttered desk, staring at the map pinned to the wall. Red strings connected various locations across the globe, each representing a high-profile theft. His gut told him these crimes were more than just about stealing valuable items.

“Agent Young,” his partner, Agent Rivera, called out, “I found something interesting.” She handed him a file with a list titled “Ozaki 8.” “The Ozaki 8?” Young muttered, flipping through the pages. “What’s this?” “It’s a list of eight extreme challenges, supposedly created by a fictional eco-warrior named Ono Ozaki,” Rivera explained. “But some believe it’s real. Each task honors a force of nature and involves incredible risk.”

Young’s eyes widened as he read through the list: Emerging Force, Birth of Sky, Life of Water, and more. “These aren’t just thefts,” he said, piecing it together. “They’re completing the Ozaki 8.” Rivera nodded. “Exactly. Each theft aligns with one of the challenges. They’re not just stealing; they’re proving something.” 

Young leaned back in his chair, deep in thought. “If they complete all eight tasks, they might gain something far more valuable than money or jewels. We need to figure out their next move.” As they delved deeper into the Ozaki 8, they realized the final task, “Act of Ultimate Trust,” was the most dangerous. It required a leap of faith, both literally and figuratively. The agents knew they had to stop the group before it reached this final challenge. “Let’s get to work,” Young said, determination in his eyes. “We must stop them before they complete the Ozaki 8 and unlock whatever they’re truly after.”

I also enjoy hiking and green spaces (nope). I'm getting totally worn out from being outbid on houses on the West side and am ready to be done but I want to make sure I'm happy where I land.

Yes, I'm a transplant looking for an affordable home. But please go easy on me. I really want to immerse myself in my neighborhood and be a good community member, so I want to make sure it's a good fit and can feel like home to me.

When I come back I have a protein shake and then 30 mins later an overnight oats with protein. The protein from the whey, yoghurt, milk, etc. adds to around 90g. 

My goal with protein is to gain muscle mass.

Is it scientifically correct that the 90g's of protein is not being used for Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)? 

Am I wasting protein here? If I am what should I do instead then, just have the protein drink and then the oats four hours later? Or have the oats before the gym and the protein drink after?

If I'm not wasting protein then is the 90g all being used for MPS.

Hope this makes sense.

As the heavy door of Ashwood Mental Hospital creaked open, a pale, slender woman stepped out. She was Audrey Patel. She covered her aching stomach and dragged her feet to walk, while the murmurs behind her followed like shadows..........","**Chapter 1 My Wife Has Violent Tendencies**

As the heavy door of Ashwood Mental Hospital creaked open, a pale, slender woman stepped out. She was Audrey Patel. She covered her aching stomach and dragged her feet to walk, while the murmurs behind her followed like shadows.



Someone whispered, ""Mr. Patel's such a saint. He still sticks with her after she went nuts and hurt others with a knife.""



Another person said bitterly, ""If my wife pulled a stunt like that, I'd kick her out the same day. She's a total disgrace to Mr. Patel.""



Someone else chimed in, ""If Ms. Patterson's father hadn't passed away, and she hadn't moved in with her uncle, she would've married Mr. Patel ages ago. Audrey would never have had the chance.""



Audrey squinted against the harsh light and gave a bitter little smile.



Everyone knew the story. She was an orphan girl from some no-name town who somehow married Clayton Patel, a big-shot lawyer with a spotless image. People all said she won the lottery.



But now, with a reputation for being violent and unstable, fired from her job and fresh out of a mental hospital, she looked even more out of place next to Clayton.



Audrey thought bitterly, 'They all think I don't deserve him. Funny thing is, the one who stuck me in that hellhole and slapped that label on me was my perfect husband himself.'



It was July. The sun blazed down, but Audrey felt chilly all over, especially her heart.



Ashwood had a glossy cover story—something about correcting troubled youth and improving their mental state. But what went on inside was a nightmare.



Audrey, a 23-year-old grown woman, had been locked in there for a month because her husband claimed she was a danger and needed to have her mind straightened out.



During the past month, she was punished, starved, locked in pitch-black isolation—until she cracked, until she agreed she was wrong and promised to change.



Now, standing outside, breathing free air again, she watched Clayton hang up a call. His handsome face twisted with irritation.



""Zoe's ran a bath for you. Let's go home and wash off the bad luck,"" Clayton said to Audrey.



Audrey dodged the hand he reached toward her shoulder.



Clayton was always well-groomed with tailored suits and expensive cologne. But today, he didn't smell like his usual scent. Instead, he reeked of something sickly sweet, like overripe fruit. That scent made Audrey sick.



Ignoring Clayton's grim face, Audrey pulled open the passenger-side door and got in.



The driver, who'd already opened the back door, glanced at Clayton in confusion.



Clayton watched her, his lips pressed tight. He thought she was clearly still sulking after a month of confinement. He figured she wasn't used to that kind of strict environment, so she threw a tantrum.



Though he had his reasons, he still went too far to send her in against her will. So, for now, he didn't blame her for her little temper.



He sat in the back seat. The driver closed the door and started the car.



Audrey turned to the window and closed her eyes. The whole thing a month ago appeared in her mind.



It was her birthday that day. Clayton brought home a special guest—his childhood friend, Valerie Patterson, and her three-year-old daughter, Luna Patterson.



While Clayton went to get the cake, Valerie grabbed a fruit knife and pressed it to her wrist, threatening to hurt herself if Audrey didn't give Clayton back to her.



Tears streamed down Valerie's face as she said she and Clayton were meant to be, that she came back to fix what they once lost.



Audrey lunged to stop Valerie and tried to snatch the knife just as Clayton walked in.



Valerie stumbled into Clayton's arms, sobbing like she'd just survived a war. ""Audrey, please don't hurt Luna. Clayton and I haven't done anything. You're getting it all wrong.""



Audrey stood frozen with the knife still in hand, her mind blanking out.



Valerie, still clinging to Clayton, glanced up at Audrey with a smug glint in her eyes. ""Clayton only let us move into your house 'cause we had nowhere else to go.



""I swear I'll pay back every penny he lent to us. Just don't scare my baby, okay? She's got autism.""



Clayton wrapped his arms around Valerie and Luna and shot a cold stare at Audrey. ""Valerie's hands are for painting. How could you hurt her?""



Little Luna, who watched the whole thing, just curled up tighter in Clayton's arms, shaking like a leaf.



Audrey let out a dry laugh, more from rage than amusement.



She thought to herself, 'So that's her game. She used my birthday party to air out her affair with Clayton. Either I suck it up and pretend my husband's got no side piece, or I pack my bags and quit the game.'



Audrey turned to Clayton, her voice firm. ""Believe it or not, she cut herself.""



""No way,"" Clayton shot back without missing a beat.



He was convinced no one knew Valerie's talent with a paintbrush better than he did. She would rather die than damage her hands. No chance she'd hurt herself just to frame Audrey.



Audrey scoffed and pointed straight at Valerie. ""Then tell me, why did you let them live in the house I bought and even gave them money? You're keeping her and her kid on the side, and I'm supposed to just be cool with it?""



Clayton's colleagues and a couple of his friends were right behind him. Being embarrassed like that in front of everyone clearly rattled him.



""My hand... Clayton, it hurts,"" Valerie whimpered, holding out her bleeding wrist, swaying like she was about to faint.



Guilt flashed across Clayton's face, but it was gone in a blink, replaced by anger. He barked at his assistant, ""My wife has violent tendencies. Send her to Ashwood Mental Hospital.""



Thinking back on it, Audrey put on a cold smile, sneering, 'To protect that woman's reputation, my husband threw me into that filthy place.'



Clayton must've caught that mocking look on her face, because for once, he tried to explain himself, ""I sent you to Ashwood to keep things from getting worse. You scared Luna.



""She had a fever for days. They've had a hard time. You shouldn't trash Valerie like that.""



Audrey opened her eyes, her gaze turning icy. ""I picked the house. I pay the mortgage. They're living in it and spending money from MY husband. Yeah, clearly I screwed up. I should've been more generous, huh?""



Clayton took a deep breath and said, ""Vally doesn't blame you. She's already dropped the charges. It won't affect you.""



Audrey sneered, thinking, 'Won't affect me? Due to my so-called violent tendencies you pinned on me, I lost my job three days after staying at Ashwood.'



Clayton and Valerie went way back. Years ago, both Valerie and Clayton's fathers got sick. Valerie's father gave up his shot at treatment and donated his kidney to save Clayton's father.



After that, Valerie and her mother moved out of town to live with her uncle. The night she turned up again, she was on the run. She was beaten by her husband, so she took her daughter to leave.



Clayton just happened to be on a business trip in that exact city. He swooped in like a hero, took on Valerie's divorce case, and brought her and her daughter back to Ironhaven.



\*\*\*\*\*



The car slowly rolled into Hightower Homes. Audrey didn't wait for it to stop but opened the door, got out, and headed straight for the elevator without a glance back.



She took a long shower and changed into clean clothes.



When she came out, Zoe was carrying dishes from the kitchen. She said with a smile, ""Dinner's almost ready, ma'am. Mr. Patel picked all your favorites.""



Clayton was on the couch going through some documents. He looked up over the rim of his gold-rimmed glasses and said, ""Dry your hair first. I'll wait to eat with you.""



Anyone walking in might've thought he was the picture of a devoted husband, setting aside legal briefs to dine with his wife.



But Audrey knew this was just his usual trick: slap you across the face and then hand you a candy.



Clayton took off his glasses and walked to the dining table. Pulling out a chair, he said, ""It's a bit late today. I'll have Zoe buy your favorite fish tomorrow.""



Audrey sat down without a word and picked up her fork.



Clayton was good at keeping his emotions locked up and hardly ever spoke more than necessary. Most of the time when they were together, Audrey always babbled him with some online gossip just to fill the silence.



Each time, Audrey would laugh out loud, yet Clayton was just calm and would sometimes give her a look to remind her of being composed.



Now, Audrey didn't even look at him. Worse, when he tried to serve her some food, she just picked it up and tossed it back onto the plate.



**Chapter 2 Don't Keep Pushing**

Clayton tried to serve her more food, but Audrey stood up, dumped her utensils in the sink, and walked straight to the bedroom.



They had a nanny at home, but Audrey liked doing things herself. She used to cook Clayton's favorite meals and laid out his suits for the day. Zoe came in for an hour daily just to tidy up.



She used to think it was a sweet little routine between them, yet now, recalling what happened, Audrey felt like she was out of her mind in the past.



Clayton's mother, Lillian Patel, always thought Audrey was after Clayton's money. She made Clayton hand over half his paycheck every month for her to keep and said she'd return it when she was sure Audrey wasn't a gold digger.



Their finances had basically been split fifty-fifty since the wedding. And outsiders still loved gossiping about how Audrey married up, about her being some clingy, fame-hungry wannabe.



Audrey put up with all of it because she loved Clayton. But now? Now she couldn't believe how blind she used to be.



The husband she always felt proud of, the man who once stood for justice, fighting tooth and nail for unpaid factory workers, now threw his own wife under the bus to protect another woman's reputation.



Clayton's hand froze in the air, and he clearly felt the weight of her cold shoulder. He wiped his mouth with a napkin and knocked gently on the bedroom door. ""Audrey, I can explain that thing.""



From inside, Audrey let out a bitter laugh and thought, 'If you had anything to say, why didn't you say it a month ago in front of your coworkers, your friends, and in front of her? What's the act for now?'



She remembered that look in his eyes that night was nothing but irritation, and he said to her, ""You can leave Ashwood once you calm down.""



He even said, ""Vally and Luna have had it rough. If you're gonna make things worse for them, then maybe it's time you felt what being truly alone is like.""



He knew she was an orphan, and he always knew he was her only lifeline. But instead of standing by her, he sided with Valerie and crushed what little hope she had left.



When Valerie watched Audrey being dragged into Ashwood, she didn't even try to hide the satisfaction in her eyes. She smiled, as if saying, 'Say what you want, Clayton won't believe you. The more you fight it, the crazier you'll look.'



Audrey tried to break free from the nurses and scrambled back toward the hallway. With just one door between them, she heard Valerie sweet-talking Clayton, ""Clay, the doctor just said I can't draw anymore, but I can still have other jobs. Audrey only hurt me 'cause she loves you too much.""



Audrey didn't hear what Clayton replied because she was already forced into a room with bars on the windows.



She'd clenched her teeth and thought, 'If Clayton wants to play savior, he better chain himself to her for life. Just don't drag decent people down with them. I'm not interested in his lame excuse.'



Clearly thrown by Audrey's sudden silence, Clayton loosened his tie, feeling irritated without knowing why. He raised his voice to say, ""Why do you hate Vally so much? She's just a friend.""



Audrey didn't buy that for a second. She couldn't believe he still pretended not to know how Valerie felt for him.



After all, Valerie was jobless, divorced, and took her three-year-old daughter with autism back to Ironhaven and stepped into their life.



Audrey sneered inwardly, 'What kind of friend pushes others to divorce? What kind of friend throws herself into the arms of another woman's husband?'



If things kept going like this, Audrey knew she'd finally go crazy one day.



She suddenly flung the bedroom door open and sneered, ""Your family owes Valerie. That's your business, not mine. You want me to take care of your parents, but now I'm supposed to repay your debt too?""



She thought bitterly, 'Just because I married a superior and famous lawyer, I should play the good wife role? I didn't get any benefit from this marriage but got hurt mentally and physically.'



She looked him straight in the eye and said firmly, ""You were scared people would talk trash about her, so you told them I was violent and unstable. Her father saved your father, so you wanna sacrifice my reputation to protect her name?""



Her voice shook with rage. ""What right does she have to live in the house I bought and spend the money my husband gives her? What right do you have to send me to that darned mental hospital?""



Audrey had been holding her rage all in for too long, and now the dam burst. She let all her rage and her heartbreak out.



She hated Valerie for twisting the truth, but even more than that, she hated the man who once promised her a warm and safe home. She took a shaky breath, wiped her face, and realized her cheeks were wet with tears.



Clayton's expression turned more serious. He hadn't expected her to be this furious. Lowering his voice, he said, ""I know you lost your job, but I'll support you. Once Vally and Luna settle down, I'll hand over the rest of my paycheck to you.""



Audrey let out a long breath, feeling tired. She thought to herself, 'If I fall for his crap again, I'm the dumbest woman ever. You betrayed me once, and what makes you think I'll believe your promise again?'



She'd seen through him completely. Clayton's heart had already gone rotten. He'd always side with Valerie. This time, she was sent to Ashwood Mental Hospital. But she didn't know if she had a fight with Valerie again, what her heartless husband would do to her.



After all, she had no family. Clayton, as her legal guardian, had the power to do whatever he wanted.



Audrey looked at Clayton. Her eyes contained no more softness, no love, just a sheet of coldness.



She said, ""Don't bother dangling carrots in front of me. I got fired due to Valerie. You're gonna pay me 150,000 dollars. Then we get a divorce. You can play house with whoever you want after that.""



""I'm not divorcing you,"" Clayton shot back without hesitation.



Yanking off his tie, he flung it onto the couch. His chest felt tight, like he couldn't breathe. He thought, 'She wants a divorce over something so small? What the hell is wrong with her?'



The tie hit a decorative piece on the coffee table, knocking it to the floor. It shattered with a sharp crash, broken into pieces.



For once, the always-composed lawyer Clayton raised his voice. ""You lost your job, and I'll make it right. But divorce? Out of the question.""



He thought he'd already lowered himself enough. He was Clayton—the admired, respected, and untouchable top-tier lawyer. Now that he was trying to meet her halfway, Audrey should've known when to quit.



But Audrey's eyes were colder than ever. There was even disgust in them.



Clayton suddenly felt something slipping out of his grasp. He couldn't name it, but the feeling irritated him more than he cared to admit.



He muttered, ""It's all in the past. Can't we let it go?""



""Clay? Is Audrey back?"" Valerie's voice rang out as she walked in, decked out in a Chanel dress, a Coach bag on her arm, and a pair of shining high heels.



Valerie was five years older than Audrey, but she dressed younger and more fashionably. Audrey had always been practical—saving every cent to pay off the mortgage early, never splurging on luxury brands.



However, Valerie, a jobless single mother with a sick toddler, strolled in head-to-toe brands. It didn't take a genius to figure out who was footing the bill.



She stopped at the entryway, pretending to be shocked at the pieces on the floor. ""Audrey, if you've got a problem, take it out on me. My hand's ruined already. Go ahead and slash me again if it makes you feel better.



""That piece is a foreign art exhibit, you know? Clayton really likes it. It cost a few grand.""



Audrey let out a laugh that was anything but amused. ""Valerie, with that kind of imagination, you seriously missed your calling. You should be stalking celebs for gossip sites. I bought that piece, okay? How this involves you?""



Before Valerie could get a word in, Audrey turned to Clayton. ""You heard her, right? That thing's a foreign exhibit, cost 6,000 dollars. You broke it. You gotta pay.""



Valerie's eyes filled with tears instantly. She turned those helpless, wounded eyes toward Clayton. ""Clay, I thought you guys were arguing about me, so I—""



Clayton clenched his fists, feeling fed up. ""Vally's already forgiven you for what you did to her. You don't need to keep pushing.""



**Chapter 3 Clear The Mess**

Valerie gently touched Clayton's arm and said, ""Clay, it's fine. I know Audrey hates me. I'll just leave now.""



But she didn't move a muscle. Instead, she looked up at Clayton with wide eyes, full of dependence and reluctance.



Clayton picked up the broken pieces and placed them on the coffee table. He was afraid Audrey might lose it again and end up hurting Valerie.



Clayton and Audrey got married just after they met each other. Back then, he was pissed at his family and randomly asked Audrey, who'd just dropped off a file at his law firm, if she'd marry him.



Audrey's reaction was unforgettable. She was first shocked, then pure joy. She told him she was an orphan, just landed a job at a foreign company, and didn't have much to offer compared to him. She promised she'd work hard, catch up to him, and be worthy.



Clayton made sure to sign a prenup, and the two of them got their marriage license without much fuss.



In the year since, Audrey worked her ass off at the office and at home. She arranged everything well, made his favorite meals, and never once complained.",1,1748899503.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Through necessity, environmental consciousness, and financial awareness, a lot of people seem to be talking more about buying things used, or finding them new but through a reselling platform and not directly from the retailer.

I have always tried to purchase things from thrift stores because it was cheaper in my early 20s. As I got older and had more money I started to buy some things new instead of looking for them used. But never everything new. There never seemed to be a reason everything needed to be new. In the last 5 or so years I’ve basically eliminated the amount of “new” things I buy. I can’t find very many things that need to be new. 

Clothes?  Fast fashion is cheap but the clothes don’t last very long. Higher quality clothes can be more expensive but a better investment. Find them on eBay or Poshmark and accidentally at a thrift store and potentially spend 1/4 the price or less for an item in great condition. Sometimes even new. 

Electronics? Plenty of places to buy refurbished items with a return policy. No need to buy it directly from the company. Household items? Facebook marketplace. Support someone’s side hustle, keep things local, help someone clean out their apartment when they move and get that coffee maker and couch for $100.

I (24) have been non-monogamous for about four years, and up until this point I’ve had relatively little drama. I’ve had partners over those years, only two of which were explicitly defined and really haven’t run into much drama until now. When I go out with people, I am upfront about this fact: I’m looking for casual connections and *potential* romantic relationships. I tell them that I don’t get into romantic relationships very often and most people up until this point have understood this. 

In December of last year, I was invited to Alex’s (23) birthday party. I knew that Alex was poly and knew one of their partners, Jamie (22), from high school (we hadn’t seen  each other at all since then). I did not realize that most people in attendance were members of their polycule. At the party, everyone was making out with each other and, as a non-monogamous person, I followed suit. The day after the party, Alex, Jamie, and Erin (26) reached out to me separately to go on dates. 

The situation with Erin is that she reached out, we had one date in December where we chatted, watched a movie at my place, and made out for a bit. I made sure to let her know that I’m very casual and pretty much everything above. After that date, we planned two dates, both of which she canceled. I attempted to set up another date and she didn’t respond for two weeks. When she did respond, she told me that she was feeling “polysaturated” (for those who are unfamiliar, essentially she was literally telling me that she wasn’t hoping to go on any more dates). As such, I didn’t reach out again. I thought that I was simply returning her energy.

Alex and Jamie live together, so my situation dating them is a bit more complicated. I went out with Jamie for the first time in December, went back to their place, slept together, and I went home. I told them that I was looking for casual dates. I went out with Alex for the first time about a week later: we grabbed coffee, went to their house, made out, drank a bit, and I slept over. I told them that I was looking for casual dates. The next “date” that we went on, it was me, Alex, and Jamie; we ended up drinking, having a threesome, and I slept over again. The week after this date, I was raped by an uninvolved individual; this individual did not use a condom but he told me that he was STI-free.

Jamie hit me up a week after it happened to hang out and I told them about this experience, as I wasn’t really feeling up to sexual things, but could probably make out for a bit without anything triggering me. We watched a movie, drank a bit, and then Alex came home. The details are a bit blurry from here on, as I was rather drunk, but I recall telling Alex about my recent negative sexual experience, and they kept asking “okay, so you’re not up for [x sexual thing], what about [y].” After a while, I was feeling too worn down to argue and too drunk to drive home, so we ended up having another threesome and I slept over. 

I received a text from Alex the following morning, reprimanding me for not letting them know that I had been potentially exposed to an STI. I understand that they were likely drunk as well and could have forgotten that I told them, but they were the one pressuring me into doing sexual things, not the other way around. I apologized and let them know that I would inform them of the test results when I got them back (ended up being negative across the board). 

The experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I decided that I no longer wanted to pursue either of them in this context and attempted to let them down easily by saying that I wanted to just be friends. I understand that I should have been clearer, but I did not want to have to unpack “y’all pressured me into sex a week after I was raped.”, as I had many other things on my plate at that time and I had told them that I was looking for casual connections. At this point, it was early February.

I thought that this would be fine and I wouldn’t have to worry about interacting with any of them ever again. Yesterday, I got two texts from Alex wherein they chastised me for “how [I] treated people around [me] who care about [me].” They specifically referenced the way I ended things with Jamie and Erin, saying that I “treated them like shit”. They ended the texts by saying “I do want you to know that you have hurt people and I have been consistently hearing about it.” I did not realize that I had left such a big gash in the polycule and do feel bad that the way that I ended things hurt people, but I stand by my decision.

TLDR: I ended communication with one member of a polycule because I thought I was returning her energy, and ended communication with two others when I felt pressured to do sexual things with which I was not particularly comfortable.

Any tips for a first-time visitor or recommendations to pad out my itinerary based on my interests?,"Hello, All! So I originally was going to London just to see Oasis and maybe take in a sight or two for a quick weekend getaway but due to recent life developments I am taking an opportunity to take this chance to really go on a dream vacation for myself as I have always wanted to visit the UK and grew up as something of an Anglophile. 

I'm still figuring out the specifics as I'm nailing down some time-sensitive things I wanted to see/do, but also wanted to get some input on some attractions that had my interest.

The weekend of July 25th through July 27th will definitely need to be London-focused as I will be attending one of the Wembley shows for Oasis on Friday, the 25th. Sunday, the 27th, I will need to be in Camden for a Progress Wrestling show (I'm a big pro wrestling fan), and I am also eyeing a tour of the Battersea Power Station (I'm also an architecture fan) but I won't know yet if that will be on Sunday or Monday as tickets are not on sale yet.

All that said, I'm thinking I should arrive on July 22nd and leave around July 30th. In that time, some places have caught my attention and I'm trying to work out the best timetables of where and when I should be for them (or if I should even bother going to any of them at all).

* The British Museum and the Tower of London - EVERYONE keeps telling me I really need to see it and it sounds like it could take a whole day.
* Seven Sisters - I thought about Cliffs of Dover originally, but I'm hearing this is a better option.
* Tank Museum - I'm also a bit of nerd with this stuff and aviation. I understand it is a way's out and that I will probably have to stay overnight in Dorset or wherever, which is fine as I was looking to experience the country outside of major cities.
* Imperial War Museum - My late father used to rave about this place so I feel I owe it to his memory to check this place out. I know it's in the opposite direction of the aforementioned places.
* Forbidden Planet - I understand it's one of the largest comic book stores in the world so I thought I'd pop in as I like a lot of that stuff.

So that's what I have so far. I don't feel the need to book my days hour-to-hour as I'm always open to wandering and seeing what I see, but having some points of interest would be good. To guide anyone as to where my interests lie, as mentioned, I like history, architecture, love LOVE movies/cinema, British pop music of the '90s (aka Britpop), David Bowie, jazz music, good coffee, good whiskey, vinyl records, video games, pro wrestling, and I am also a working voice actor.

What can I say? I have specific but varied interests. I hope that helps and if nothing comes to mind for recommendations, I am also open to general travel tips as this is my first time in the UK (visa protocol, lodgings, cash to carry, wi-fi on the go, etc.)

## Key Features Analysis

pet carrier backpacks come packed with a variety of features designed to enhance both pet and owner comfort, safety, and convenience. Understanding these features will help you determine which backpack best aligns with your needs and your pet's specific requirements.

**Ventilation and Breathability**

Proper airflow is crucial for your pet's comfort, especially on warm days or during longer journeys. Look for backpacks with multiple mesh windows or panels strategically placed to promote ventilation.Mesh construction allows for excellent airflow, preventing your pet from overheating and ensuring a comfortable habitat inside the backpack. Some models feature extra-large mesh windows on the front,sides,and top,offering panoramic views for your pet while maximizing air circulation.

Refer to the manufacturer's size chart to determine the appropriate size based on your pet's measurements. Keep in mind that some backpacks have weight restrictions, so be sure to choose one that can comfortably accommodate your pet's weight. consider purchasing a larger backpack if your pet is still growing to ensure they have ample space as they mature.

Accidents happen, so choose a backpack that's easy to clean and maintain. Look for water-resistant or waterproof materials and removable, washable liners.

A waterproof or water-resistant exterior will protect the backpack from spills and stains, making it easy to wipe clean with a damp cloth.Removable,washable liners can be easily removed and laundered,keeping the backpack fresh and hygienic. Consider backpacks with multiple compartments or pockets for storing waste bags, treats, and other essentials, keeping everything organized and easily accessible.

## FAQs Section

Navigating the world of pet carrier backpacks can raise several questions for potential buyers.Here are answers to some common concerns to help you make an informed purchase.

**What size pet carrier backpack do I need for my dog/cat?**
The correct size depends on your pet's measurements and weight. Measure your pet's height from the top of their head to the ground, and their length from their nose to the base of their tail, while they are standing. Add a few inches to these measurements to ensure your pet has enough room to stand, turn around, and lie down comfortably. Then, compare your pet's weight to the backpack's weight limit.

Make sure to consult the manufacturer's sizing chart for specific guidelines for each model. Remember, it’s better to err on the side of a larger size to ensure your pet's comfort. Buying to small of a carrier restricts your pet's movement and causes significant stress.

**How do I get my pet used to a pet carrier backpack?**
Introduce the backpack gradually and make it a positive experience. Start by placing the backpack in a familiar area of your home with the door open. Place treats, toys, or a comfortable blanket inside to encourage your pet to explore it. Gradually increase the amount of time your pet spends inside the backpack, rewarding them with positive reinforcement.

Once your pet is comfortable entering and exiting the backpack, try closing the door for short periods, gradually increasing the duration. take your pet for short walks or rides in the backpack, rewarding them with treats and praise. Patience and consistency are key to helping your pet acclimate to the backpack.

**Are pet carrier backpacks airline-approved?**
Not all pet carrier backpacks meet airline requirements. Check with your specific airline for their size and weight restrictions for in-cabin pet carriers. Look for backpacks that are specifically labeled as ""airline-approved"" and meet the airline's dimensions.

Keep in mind that some airlines may have additional requirements, such as specific ventilation requirements or restrictions on soft-sided carriers. Its crucial to check with the airline well in advance of your trip to ensure your chosen backpack meets their requirements and avoid any potential issues at the airport.

**How do I clean a pet carrier backpack?**
Cleaning instructions can vary depending on the materials of the backpack. Most backpacks can be spot-cleaned with a damp cloth and mild detergent. Removable liners can typically be machine-washed and dried according to the manufacturer's instructions.

For deeper cleaning,some backpacks may be hand-washable. Avoid using harsh chemicals or bleach, as these can damage the materials and irritate your pet. Always make sure the backpack is wholly dry before storing it or using it with your pet.

This answer is likely to be controversial, given the history with this sub.

A subscription allows you access to sample-sized lots from a range of roasters, and the base subscription is reasonably priced.

I am new to home roasting and based in Germany, where the options are a bit limited. I can import a Skywalker v1 fairly cheaply, while the v2 costs nearly twice as much.

I am confident with electronics and happy to mod the v1 if needed. I typically go through just over 250g of coffee a week, so that's the minimum batch size I’m aiming for.

A few questions:

* Can a well-modded v1 match the v2 in performance?
* Is the v2 worth the extra cost for better features out of the box?
* Any other good options in Europe that handle approx. 250g batches?

Would really appreciate input from anyone who’s used either (or both).

One pound of ground chicken ($3) , browned in olive oil, seasoned with chili powder, cumin, oregano, red pepper flakes, garlic, onion flakes, lots of black pepper smoked paprika, a little celery seed and little annatto for color. Browned until lots of fond then deglazed with a couple tablespoons of lime juice. 

Black Beans (89 cent can) - I browned a small chopped onions with a tablespoon of tomato paste and heaping teaspoon of Goya sofrito paste, added two bay leaves while browning mixture. Added about a tablespoon of red wine vinegar, teaspoon of lime juice, and pinch of sugar. Mixed in can of undrained black beans. Seasoned with cumin, oregano, black pepper, garlic, and onion powder.

Hi everyone — hoping to hear from anyone who's had a similar experience.

About 13 days ago, I had an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with fine needle aspiration to sample a pancreatic cyst. Things were fine at first, but around Day 8, I suddenly developed upper abdominal pain that radiated to my mid-back and chest. It started after having coffee and a donut in the morning and got worse after I ate pizza later in the day — I felt nauseated and uncomfortable almost immediately.

The pain didn’t improve with walking or stretching, though standing felt better than sitting. My back felt bruised, and pressure/massage helped temporarily. I went to the ER — they ran labs and imaging. Lipase was mildly elevated (91), WBC was 13.8, and I had persistent pain that didn’t respond to morphine, Zofran, or a GI cocktail. I was discharged still in pain.

My urinalysis showed elevated RBCs (4–10) and leukocytes, but imaging didn’t show anything remarkable with the kidneys.

Since then, I’ve been eating bland foods and avoiding anything acidic or fatty. I did go to a theme park the weekend after my procedure and ate fatty food and drank alcohol, which may have made things worse. Now I’m still dealing with back pain and occasional upper abdominal discomfort. Oddly, Tylenol helped more than anything else, and I still can’t lie on my stomach comfortably.

My GI thinks it could be gastritis worsened by stress or post-procedure inflammation, but I'm not sure. Has anyone else had pain that radiates into the back more than the stomach, or symptoms that flare up days after a procedure like this?

Would really appreciate any insight, advice, or similar stories. Thanks!


EDIT TO ADD: I was on an IV of antibiotics for 30 mins post procedure due to blood being present during the fine needle aspiration. I was on Cipro for 5 days after the procedure. ",1,1748897817.0,Gastritis,2,1.0,False
1l1tgvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1l1tgvj/nosurf_might_be_relatively_easy_if_your_a_social/,"Nosurf might be relatively easy if your a social person, but how about those who are lonely?","The idea that stopping smartphone usage and whatnot will bring you a life that is reminiscient of the 80s/90s is only mildly optimistic for those are social butterflies. Bored? Why not go out and have a coffee with a friend, go to the cinema with a friend, go for a walk with a friend, chill and watch a movie with a friend. After you're exhausted socialising, you can go read a book and do whatever you'd like. 

But how about the people who are generally alone? Nosurf might at first seem the perfect solution, you stop using your phone, you go outside, you meet people and you do things. The issue is, this isn't the old world anymore, people don't go outside and meet each other like that, people with your interests and hobbies are met online, if you had niche interests 30 years ago, well you'd be lonely. The same case would be like that now, the internet provides a community for lonely people.

It's tough because I recognise the advantages of nosurfing, but when you're lonely and you sit there by yourself without something to distract you from the feelings and pangs of loneliness I can see why people would often chose to constantly distract themselves than having to suffer the feelings of hollowness.

A great example I often think about is how in Taxi Driver, De Niros character just literally sits alone with his thoughts all day which brings him to a bad place, if he had reddit perhaps life would have been atleast a bit more placated for him",4,1748897816.0,nosurf,4,0.83,False
1l1tfs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1l1tfs4/there_out_there_killing_off_youtubers/,There Out There Killing Off Youtubers,"The room was bathed in the warm glow of my laptop screen as I leaned back in my chair, munching on a bowl of popcorn. The familiar sound of Markiplier's laughter filled the quiet space, a comforting background to my lazy afternoon. He was playing a new game, one of those quirky indie titles that only he could make entertaining. His character on the screen stumbled through a pixelated forest, a neon smile plastered on its digital face.



I had been watching Mark's streams for years. His videos had become a staple in my weekly routine, a source of laughter and a much-needed escape from reality. His genuine reactions to the absurd and his ability to make even the most mundane game feel like an adventure had earned him millions of fans, myself included.



As Mark's character approached a clearing, I reached for more popcorn, the salty crunch a perfect companion to the game's suspenseful score. Suddenly, the screen flickered, and Mark's laughter was cut short. He sat up straight, his eyes widened, and his hand clutched his chest. For a split second, I thought it was part of the game's plot, a new twist to keep viewers on their toes.



But the color drained from his face, and his hand slammed against the desk, sending his headset flying. He slumped over, unmoving. The only sound was the game's music, now eerie and out of place. I stared, popcorn frozen in mid-air, my heart hammering against my ribs. This wasn't part of the show. Something was very, very wrong.



I screamed his name, willing him to sit up and laugh, to tell me it was all a prank. But he remained still, and the realization dawned on me like a cold, dark fog. Markiplier, my favorite YouTuber, the man who had brought joy to my life for so many years, was dead.



Panic gripped me as I frantically refreshed his channel, hoping it was some glitch, a twisted joke. But the stream had ended, leaving his lifeless form staring back at me. The comments section below erupted in a frenzy of shock and disbelief. Then, as if a dam had burst, news of other YouTuber deaths began to flood in. Famous faces, one after the other, dropping like flies. Each video ended the same way: a sudden, inexplicable end.



My mind raced, trying to piece together the chaos. Was it a virus? A coordinated attack? As I scoured the internet, searching for answers, the weight of the situation grew heavier. The community I had grown to cherish, the influencers who had shaped my humor and interests, were being wiped out before my eyes. The world was changing in an instant, and there was nothing I could do but watch in horror.



The news outlets began to catch on, their headlines a mix of shock and confusion. Famous YouTubers Collapse Live on Stream – No Known Cause. The videos were shared across social media, and the hashtags grew grim. #YouTuberDeaths, #WhatIsHappening, #PrayForTheFamous. Yet, amidst the panic, there was no information, no explanation. Just a series of disturbing, unexplained events.



I felt compelled to reach out to other fans, to share our collective shock and fear. The forums were alight with theories, each more outlandish than the last. Some spoke of curses, others of alien interference. Yet, the most chilling thought was the one that whispered through the cracks of our digital conversations – what if it was contagious? What if watching the videos could somehow harm us too?



The next day, the streets were eerily quiet. The usual buzz of online chatter had turned into a solemn silence. The world had lost a piece of itself, and everyone was trying to understand why. As I walked to the local coffee shop, I overheard snippets of conversation, all revolving around the tragedies. The barista's eyes were red and puffy, and she served me my drink with a trembling hand. She had been a fan too.



When I finally sat down with my coffee, my phone buzzed with a notification. Another YouTube icon had fallen. The screen flickered with the image of PewDiePie, clutching his chest just as Mark had. My hand shook as I clicked away from the video, unable to watch another soul leave us in such a manner.



The days that followed were a blur of grief and dread. More names were added to the list, and the world grew increasingly somber. The internet, once a place of endless entertainment, had become a minefield of tragedy. The laughter that had echoed through my living room so many times now seemed like a distant memory, a reminder of a carefree time that was slipping away.



The government issued statements, promising an investigation, but the lack of answers only fueled the fire of speculation. The theories grew darker, more sinister, each one a reflection of our collective fear. The world had become a stage for a horror show, and we were all just players in a game we didn't understand.



I couldn't help but wonder if I was next. Each time I felt a twinge in my chest or a sudden dizziness, I would freeze, my heart racing. Yet, amidst the fear, there was something else – anger. Anger that someone, or something, had taken away the people who had brought light to our lives. And I knew I couldn't be the only one feeling it.



The community, once bound by our shared love of laughter, had transformed into a beacon of hope in the face of the unknown. We banded together, sharing information, comfort, and the desperate need for answers. The void left by our lost influencers was filled with a newfound sense of unity. We had to find out what was happening, not just for them, but for all of us.



As the weeks passed, the deaths continued, but so did our determination. The internet buzzed with the energy of a million brains working together. Slowly, patterns began to emerge, connections that had been overlooked. We discovered that each YouTuber had played a game from the same mysterious developer, a company that had seemingly disappeared overnight.



The game, named ""Echoes of the Lost,"" was a puzzle-filled horror adventure, with a twist. It was designed to be played live, the audience's engagement directly affecting the game's outcome. But now, it was clear that something within the game had turned deadly.



A group of dedicated fans, fueled by loss and a burning need for justice, decided to take action. We formed an alliance, sharing our skills and knowledge. Programmers, gamers, and conspiracy theorists united under one banner – to find the truth behind the Echoes and stop the curse before it claimed more lives.



And so, my journey began. I went from being a passive viewer to an active player in a game that had gone terribly wrong. With every keystroke and whispered strategy, we were one step closer to solving the puzzle that had claimed our heroes. The fate of the digital world – and perhaps our own – rested in our hands.



The group grew rapidly as the news of our alliance spread. We had people from all over the world, each bringing their unique insights and expertise to the table. We set up a secure forum where we could share information without fear of prying eyes. The game, ""Echoes of the Lost,"" became our obsession. We studied every frame of every stream, looking for clues. The game's graphics were retro, with a haunting score that seemed to follow us even when we weren't playing.



One of our members, a young coder named Lily, discovered something peculiar. The game's code contained hidden messages, encrypted in a way that suggested they were never meant to be found. She worked tirelessly, cracking the code piece by piece. The messages spoke of an ancient curse, a digital pestilence that had been unleashed. It was clear we were dealing with something more than a simple glitch or malicious software.



The deaths continued, and with each one, the tension grew. We worked around the clock, fueled by coffee and grief. We had to find the source, a way to stop the curse before it reached us. The messages in the code spoke of an ""admin"" who held the key, a puppet master orchestrating this digital apocalypse. We had to find them, to understand their motives, and to end their twisted game.



One night, as the moon cast shadows across my desk, I found it. A name, hidden deep within the code. ""Lament Configuration."" It was cryptic, but it was something. I posted my findings on the forum, and the room lit up like a Christmas tree as everyone jumped on the clue. We dug deeper, tracing the name to an obscure chat room, a digital underground where the most dedicated fans of ""Echoes"" gathered.



The room was filled with whispers of the game's dark secrets and the rumor of a final stream. The admin, it seemed, was going to play the game one last time, with a twist. The stakes had never been higher. We had to be ready. We had to find a way to enter the game ourselves, to confront the source of the curse and put an end to the madness. Our lives had become intertwined with the very fabric of the internet, and now, we had to save it.



The night of the final stream approached like a storm on the horizon. We gathered in the chat room, our hearts racing as we prepared to enter the game. The whispers grew louder, the anticipation palpable. And then, the screen flickered to life. The game's iconic opening sequence played, but this time, the colors were darker, the sounds more sinister. The admin had arrived.



As the game began, we watched, our eyes glued to the screen. The digital world was a twisted reflection of reality, filled with traps and horrors that seemed to be tailored to each player. We shouted advice, our voices a cacophony of desperation. But we were getting closer, the end of the curse within reach.



The admin's avatar, a faceless creature of pixels and malice, turned to face the camera. It was time to make our move. With shaking hands, I typed the command Lily had crafted, a digital counter-curse meant to disrupt the game's lethal flow. The screen flickered, the game's world trembled, and for a moment, we dared to hope.



But the admin was ready. The game's rules bent and twisted, turning against us. We watched in horror as the avatar grew stronger, the room around us seemingly collapsing into the very screen we stared at. The line between the game and reality blurred, and we realized with a cold, sinking dread that we had underestimated the enemy we faced. The battle for the soul of YouTube had only just begun, and we were about to find out if we were players or pawns in this deadly game.",1,1748897741.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

This is something I never thought I’d experience, but here I am. I’m 23, male, and during an internship last year, I developed a close relationship with my direct supervisor, a 49-year-old woman. She’s single, has no children, and lives a quiet life. What started as mentorship grew into something… I can’t quite define.

Throughout the internship, she was warm, protective, and emotionally present in a way I didn’t expect from a professional environment. She would give me rides home, sometimes pay for lunch, and we’d often have long, meaningful conversations. Toward the end of the internship, she told me she felt “nostalgic” about me leaving. We never crossed any physical line, but the emotional depth between us was undeniable.

Since I left, we’ve kept in touch. Every couple of weeks she texts me and she mostly initiates contact and every 2–3 months we meet up. We’ve had dinners, coffees, and even one evening where she invited me to join her sister and nephews. She once gave me a book with a handwritten note.

Despite the age difference and the fact that nothing “happened,” I feel emotionally entangled. I don’t know if she’s just lonely, if she sees me as a surrogate son, as a friend or if there’s a deeper attraction neither of us has admitted. Or just a mix of several things. She has never said anything inappropriate, and I’ve never made a move, but I sometimes wonder if there’s a mutual tension we’re both avoiding for obvious reasons. I see her as a special friend but I also know that this might be interpreted differently.

We’re supposed to meet soon for a “drink by the sea” (which she suggested!) to say goodbye before I leave town.

Anyone else experienced something like this? How do you interpret these kinds of connections?


TL; Dr : 23M formed a close, emotionally intense bond with 49F former boss. Nothing physical, but lots of connection and ambiguity. She initiates contact. Not sure what to call this.

Mounting hardware for stock and grip included, however the grip that's been sent to me had AR15 hardware included it seems, so I've had to search for compatible in my coffee can. No issues with my WBP, so two screws are included. Perfect choice for your beater AKM. $60 shipped. 


[Hidden Hybrid double 9mm/40S&W mag carrier](https://imgur.com/ta4V6cG) with all the additional stuff: screws, nuts, spacers. [Never carried](https://imgur.com/OKDTas2), turned out to be too thick for IWB for me. $30 shipped. 


WBP/Linemount AKM Enhanced safety selector for **stamped** AK. Kinda Krebs-at-home, but sports even lower and wider index finger grip pad. Turned out to be not compatible with my right side folding stock of choice, so have to go. $20 shipped, or $10 if purchased with any other item. 


[Microtech Amphibian Ram-Lok](https://imgur.com/a/KbRV9LK), Stonewash, Tan Frag (137RL-10FRGTTA) that I've wanted to try as a carry. Turned out to be too chunky for what it is and too far away from the original shape (last pic in the album, not for sale). Also, clip is too rigid and pocket-destroying.

I'm the first owner, tried to carry it and cut couple of tomatoes with it as a test (and washed afterwards!). It's a fine knife and I did like the frag grip, but essentially it's not my cup of tea.Was trying to make a clip a little bit more forgiving by adding three layers of amber thermal tape underneath, so thread fix is broken there. The heads are not damaged. Blade is centered, Edge is flawless. There are some marks on the engagement surfaces due to flipping.
tl/dr: carried couple of times, flipped, cut soft things, unscrewed the clip.",3,1748897373.0,GunAccessoriesForSale,2,0.81,False

Buy[ Jon Bonso test](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonjonbonso/) from Udemy for

* Better pricing in countries where Udemy offers purchase price parity - for example some courses are just Rs 399 / $5 equivalent in India vs USD15-20 elsewhere
* Lifetime access 
* Slightly slower updates
* There used to be no ""review mode"" equivalent but this recently changed with a practice mode (I am not super familiar with this) 
* If you live in the US - there are options to get access to Udemy via public library for free 

Buy from [tutorialsdojo.com](http://tutorialsdojo.com/) for

* Paying the authors more / direct payment without Udemy's cut
* 1 year access only - not lifetime anymore (doesn't matter if you buy courses right when you want to take the exam)
* Faster updates to questions / answer
* Very useful review mode where you don't have to take a full exam - you just go question by question and you can do bite sized learning all through the day, on your coffee break, commute etc

I used to binge purchase from Udemy but switched to TD for the review mode but I am a bit grumpy with having lost all my courses after the 1 year window including some I binge purchased but never took the exam (apparently I can raise a support ticket but well..)

If you want a further list of differences, you need to go to [https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/faqs/](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/faqs/) and expand the question ""For practice exams, what are the different training / exam modes in the Tutorials Dojo portal?""

There is a table with all the differences listed.

I work fully remote and have a dedicated office space. I’m geographically bound to a certain IP address because it’s healthcare-adjacent, so I need to be at my house to work. Which can be tough! My job is good but I don’t plan to stay here longer than a year or so. Mostly doing it for the experience in the field. 

Anywho, my current routine involves working outside for an hour or so each day and going to the gym after work most days. But I feel like I waste so much time because of my inability to get out of bed in the morning!!!!

Ideally I’d love to be a morning gym person, so that I could shower, do my hair, and dress fresh everyday. But I cannot, for the life of me, get out of bed before I absolutely need to. 

I use a Hatch alarm that lights up gradually 30 minutes before the alarm, and it rotates 90s-inspired songs for the alarm itself so it feels varied and different. I’m usually in bed reading by 10:30pm at the latest, and my alarm goes off at 7–objectively enough sleep. But I almost always snooze my alarm until 8:55 and just have time to make a coffee before I log onto work. 

I want to take better advantage of this morning time so that I have more time to do fun, non-gym things after work. Any advice?!?",1,1748897036.0,AskWomenOver30,5,0.67,False

The relationship was short in terms of time, but intense and incredibly destabilizing — it’s had a major impact on my nervous system, and I’m only just starting to piece together why I feel so shaken.

They had a deeply entrenched victim mentality, personalized everything, and couldn’t tolerate any feedback without either shutting down, blaming me, or flipping the script. Every conflict became a referendum on my character. I found myself constantly questioning my tone, over-explaining myself, and working double-time to avoid being misunderstood or triggering them.

What’s wild is that I entered the relationship as someone who valued directness, honesty, and mutual repair. But by the end, I felt like I was walking on eggshells 24/7. Any attempt at emotional accountability turned into a spiral of blame-shifting/deflection. I was so scared to offer feedback or bring up my needs... They would either make it about how I didn't use the right wording (semantics arguments), spiritual bypassing (""that's something you should bring to God, not to the relationship""), or turning it back on me (""do you think maybe you're just triggered about something in your childhood?""). When it got really bad, and they couldn't skirt accountability any other way, they went as far as to say they ""didn't believe people can hurt other people because people are completely responsible for their own emotions, so I can't apologize. But I can say negotiate and  'I'm sorry I hurt you' if that'll make you feel better"".

I realized I wasn’t in a partnership, I was trapped in someone else’s narrative. Where they were always going to be the victim (like with all their other exes and everyone in their life) and I was always going to be working to ""prove"" I wasn't just another villian by overfunctioning. It felt like my reality was constantly being rewritten. And now, even small, new spaces (like going to a coffee shop or riding in someone’s car) trigger feelings of entrapment. I’ve been dealing with symptoms of agoraphobia and hypervigilance, which I now understand are trauma responses — not “overreactions.”

The hardest part? Feeling like I’ll never be able to trust again. Not just others, but myself. I’m terrified of missing red flags again, of betraying my gut, or getting pulled back into someone’s emotional chaos at the expense of my own clarity and stability. If you’ve been through this, how did you begin to rebuild your self-trust? How did you start feeling safe in your body and in new connections again? Thanks for reading. I guess I just needed to say out loud: it was real. It was harmful. And I want to heal, not just get over it.

\---

edit: I still have fantasies sometimes of them realizing that they were in some testing or protest behavior and reaching out, seeing how much I loved them and supported them. That they'll write me some handwritten letter (I dont know why this is how it shows up in my fantasy, could also be a phone call or text) and make amends for all these overt and covert ways they ""tested"" me to see if I'd stick around before finally breaking and leaving for my own well-being. But I also know that's unrealistic and just keeps me attached to them. When I 'play the tape through' I know it could never be healthy.

I also hope its clear, I by no means believe I was perfect in this relationship. I bypassed my own boundaries and over-gave, leaning into co-dependency/anxious attachment, because I wanted so badly to avoid the cold and withdrawal of their hot and cold behavior. They admitted to me once that they knew they had some ""growing up to do"" in the relationship after they did some severe emotional whiplash after being triggered that left me with a panic attack, dipping out on me after the first time we had sex, which felt really scary. Also any time I talked about sex, it could be something they also did or had done, but because I did it, it triggered them. Those things aren't their fault (none of this is 'fault') but my support network made it very clear to me that this person was showing signs of emotional abuse very early on (I could laugh at a word being mispronounced and they would shut down and personalize it and say I was making fun of them) and instead I stayed and tried to prove that I was different and actually loved them (I did).

Quick background: First time trying meds for ADHD (finally diagnosed at 36 — better late than never). We started with a non-stimulant because I also deal with anxiety and occasional depression.

I’m also on 80 mg Fluoxetine (Prozac) and 10 mg Buspirone, and I’m in therapy. At the time I was finishing my CS degree (senior year), so I was super motivated to give something a shot to help me focus and push through to graduation.

⸻

First Month (Started March 15)

Pros:
	•	Focus was AMAZING — seriously, I was knocking out programming assignments I’d been putting off forever, keeping up with chores, and actually feeling productive.

Cons (pretty fast):
	•	Bladder issues — felt like I couldn’t fully empty, constantly had the urge to pee but couldn’t quite finish (super annoying).
	•	Sensitive testicles + occasional semen leakage (weird, but didn’t really affect sex life — my husband and I were both stressed and busy anyway).

⸻

Around One Month In (April 15)
	•	Testicle stuff would kinda come and go randomly — couldn’t figure out why.
	•	Bladder issues were still there.
	•	BUT focus was still great, so I stuck with it.

Also started noticing some heart stuff — occasional palpitations. I track my heart rate during cardio (cycling, assisted squats).
	•	Active HR ~155 bpm = fine
	•	Resting HR ~100 bpm = not great, psychiatrist said to keep an eye on it.

Psych said not to mess with my other meds (Prozac/Buspirone) until after graduation since stress levels were already high.

⸻

Mid-May (Graduation, Family Visiting, High Stress Time)

This was peak chaos: finals, last-minute projects, tons of family flying in for graduation. As someone who gets overstimulated easily and has social anxiety… it was A LOT.

BUT:
✅ Graduated! 🎓
✅ Hosted family
✅ Finished all finals/projects

Then I randomly checked my blood pressure (hadn’t checked since the first month on Strattera, when it was normal).
Now it was higher — not crazy high but higher than my usual.

Psych thought it might just be from partying (alcohol, junk food, stress). Said if it didn’t go down after stopping Strattera, we’d need to address it.

⸻

Now (4 Days Off Strattera)
	•	Off it for 4 days.
	•	BP is still a little high (though I had 2 coffees today 🤷🏻‍♂️).
	•	Going to follow up with my PCP and see if I can get it under control with diet & exercise — otherwise I might need BP meds.

ADHD-wise:
	•	Not as laser-focused as on Strattera, but still functioning okay.
	•	Main worry now is BP.
	•	Meeting with psych at the end of the month to talk about next steps — likely another non-stim option.

I’m also curious about Wellbutrin, since it could potentially help with ADHD + anxiety/depression — but gotta be careful since I need to keep an eye on BP and I’m already on Prozac + Buspirone (which supposedly don’t usually affect BP, but who knows).

⸻

Final Thoughts

Bottom line: I’m glad I tried Strattera. It really did help with focus and productivity — but the urination issues + testicle stuff + heart rate/BP concerns made it not worth it for me long-term.

Not planning to go back on it, but I’m still hopeful to find something else that works.

Just wanted to share in case anyone else is weighing the pros/cons of this med or noticing similar side effects. Listen to your body!

1l1szdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1l1szdt/i_just_feel_lost_because_of_this_girl_i_met_i/,I just feel lost because of this girl I met. I really like her but don't know if I should stay or not because it reflects more on my character and values if I do.,"This is going to be a long story builld up to understand my situation. So I thank you for anyone who reads this to explain how I feel about the situation and how I built up to where I am with her and then..... I just feel a little soul crushed after what suddenly happened this morning. Thank you for reading and I just need to let this out.

I (33M) met this girl (33F) on a dating app last November in 2024. We matched and she is really nice and we chatted for while. It took a while for us to actually meet in person and the first time I met her at a coffee shop she was nice. Then I got shot down for asking her out twice afterwards so I just had to ask her if she was interested anymore. I told her it is okay, as adults, we can talk maturely about these things. I said it's okay for her to look for other guys but she just has to be honest with me so I should know to move on or not. She did tell me though that she is not ""keeping me"" or anything. She said that I am free to choose who I want to be with. I respect her for saying that but also a little sad to hear she is okay with me seeing someone else. But I understand.

She told me, unfortunately, she is going through a breakup and she wans't sure if she was actually ready or not. That kind of made a little upset/sad because why would you be on a dating app then. But of course, I didn't yell or anything. We both handled it like adults and I can sympathize for how that feels. She is actually from different country and fled here because of current events. So she is alone with only her aunt and her cousin. Her mom and brother are back in their country.

So later fast forward to February 2025. She got into a car accident. A teenager with his dad hit her car and totaled her car. I didn't get a message for her for about a week so I just sent a general message to be nice and check up on her. She reached out to me saying she doesn't know how to handle the situation with buying a new car. She got her insurance handled, thankfully, but she has no idea bout car hunting. Previously, I told her I have experience with cars. Anyway, for the next 3 weeks, she has been absolutely affectionate towards me in a friend way and sometimes infatuated way. But mainly friendly way. She expressed to me that she needs time still but texted me ""Maybe we can be a couple in the future"". That really meant a lot to me. So during this time she expressed she never met someone like me who was so helpful and honestly, I did a lot to get out of my way to help her. I picked her up and drove here everywhere all day for car locations an hour away, etc. Also, after the car purchase I continued to help her because she lived an hour away from the dealership and I lived closer so I kind of served as a messenger for her and talked to dealership son her behalf. etc. all that kind of stuff.

The biggest thing I expressed to her is that I offered to help in exchange for nothing. I just wanted to help her, naturally, because I liked her but also as a friend to support her. I also told her I trust myself to not harass you in anyway and it went just like that. She really trusts me and expresses it to me because I can help her and not be a douchebag guy who wanted something from her. I  have grown up with a lot of respect for people and that is something I am proud of for myself.

After this car situation, she expressed to me she is just not ready for a relationship. Ngl, I did cry a little bit and expressed to her why would she say things to me like ""In a future be a couple"". I told her it's not right to fill my head with these thoughts just yet. But we still hung out and I just wanted to be a good person. She has no family and I've actually still helped her as a human being to another.

Then now 3 months later, she works quite often and overtime because she has to support herself and also her mom back in their country. So she only has Sunday's off. We meet for coffee every now and then and every time we meet. She wants to spend more time with me and on rainy days, she locks arms with me with my umbrella and she always wants to hug me. A lot of physical affection I can feel is naturally getting better and better. And she finally said I looked cute. She recently went to California for vacation last week and she took many pictures with her cousin. She said she even brought me a gift.

But now........ so I don't use the dating apps often nor do I get matches. I just look at it every now and then but even so I still like her a lot and I don't really care about the very few matches I get nor do I want to pursuit it. I just look every now and then because she said for me to but I just cant truly commit to a dating app right now. There was one girl who I matched with and she seemed nice but I still felt like my loyalty (maybe to strong a word but I really like her) and heart belonged to the same girl I was talking to.

But now, today I just saw that she created a new dating account. I was not expecting to see her on it because she told me she wasn't looking. I know we are all adults though and we're not dating or anything so I understand but still it hurts a little. She even used her recent photo from the California trip. So I know it's new...... it kind of destroyed me a little bit. This girl expressed to me a lot of things that I believed she really had feelings for me. She and I are always following each other's instagram and we liked and say good morning to each other often. She is always physically comfortable with me as well. She always initiates the hug for me and even said ""Now give me a hug"".

I don't know if I should stay here any longer. I helped her as a human being to another in her dire situation she was in. She calls her mom on Sunday's and even talked to her about me and how helpful I was. She told me she prayed that God sent me to her and she was thankful....

.... but now I don't know how I feel to see her on the dating app. If I leave this situation, I helped her a lot because I liked her I cannot lie. I also helped her because I didn't want to be a typical douchebag only helping her because I ""wanted something"".  So I'm still glad she can trust me as her only ""guy friend"" here in the states. I want the best for her still but I also feel like i'm tearing myself apart here as well. I don't want to be the ""If she's not dating me I'll just leave. I'm out""......no, this is more of feeling ""I think I'm destroying myself mentally because I am keeping myself around for something that will not happen"". She is really sweet and I don't express any anger towards her. That's not fair to her. She deserves a comfortable life with everything she was gone through. She has no immediate family and she relies solely on herself. Always working so hard and doing everything to survive.

...... I know she deserves her happiness and I just feel if I leave this situation to protect myself. Am I doing all this because I like her and only for that? How does that reflect on me? I will be seeking therapy for this. I need professional help for what is gong through my mind but I will also appreciate anyone who takes time to give advice here.

I'm probably thinking top hard about this tbh. 7 months may seem short but a lot can happen in this time frame.

TL:DR - Girl I met on dating app says she's not ready, I helped her a lot and she expressed so many levels of  affection to me and said we could possibly be a future couple, 7 months later I found out she created a new dating app account. Don't know if I should stay or continue this friendship and I don't know how this reflects upon me as person who was trying to help as both a friend and low key affections.",1,1748896663.0,offmychest,4,1.0,False

*\[Sunday, March 25th, 5173. A run down warehouse in the Undercity\]*

I stretched languidly in my bed, feeling the last vestiges of sleep leave my body. I rose, shrugged into my robe and shuffled to my little kitchen. Yawning, I pulled out the steel percolator, filled the reservoir and scooped the life-giving crushed beans into it.

I set it on the stove and turned it on, then walked to the back warehouse. Row upon row of bins filled with various electronics, frames, gears and gewgaws filled the space. A small paper map at eye level on each row detailed the contents of the warehouse. I walked to the far back corner and pulled a couple of blue bins from the shelf. Behind them was a cleverly hidden wall safe, which I opened with a wave of my hand.

I didn’t own many electronics, preferring the old way of doing things. But this was one thing I couldn’t do without. An implant in the palm of my left hand that linked to my emotional state. With it, I had had the safe keyed to open *only* if I were calm and collected.

While we Nullborn didn’t exactly *forbid* technology, we were pretty damn adept at using it to our own ends.

The safe opened silently, and I reached in, collecting the slim binder full of various papers. I closed the safe, replacing the bins *just* so, and trekked back to the kitchen as the percolator finished its job. I set the binder down on the table, and grabbed a pair of mugs from the cabinet. For good measure, I grabbed the sugar and milk, too. The courier would be here shortly, and I wanted to make sure they had something to help them along their way.

I took the percolator, mugs, sugar and milk to the table and sat down, wondering just what business the council had with me. Thankfully, I didn’t have to wonder long, as a knock sounded at the door.

I snuck a peek through the tiny hole at the side of the door, seeing the dusky coat all couriers wore. Still, I had to be sure. Hesitantly, I called through the door.

“Hello?”

“*Package for you, Ma’am.*”

“Leave it behind the hessias, please.”

“*Sorry. All I see are columbines.*”

I nodded and opened the door, welcoming the courier in.

“Did you *have* to use an older code, Wil?”

I stuck my hand out, which she shook warmly. “Yes. I needed to know who it was. What I have isn’t safe.”

She nodded absently and sniffed the air, her nose crinkling. “Damn, Wil. It smells like a junkyard had a baby with a ‘thopter in here. Open a fucking window sometime. Wait. Is that *coffee*? I haven’t had that in *months*!” A hopeful grin spread across her ruddy cheeks.

I nodded and motioned to the table. “Sure is. Help yourself.”

She nearly ran to the table and filled a mug with the bitter, black brew, sipping it appreciatively. Her features sagged in pleasure and I grinned. Coffee wasn’t *cheap* by any means. Not even we Nullborn could grow it in large enough amounts.

This made for a *damn* good bribe.

“So, what do you have for us, Wil?” She sipped her cup daintily. “Oh! Sorry. I’m Melody, by the way.”

I took a seat on the couch and gestured to the binder. “That.”

She lifted an eyebrow. “Paper? You’re sending *paper* to the Vault?”

I nodded. “I’ve already sent photos to everyone who needs to know, but this will serve as backup to the digital.”

“What… what’s in it?” She reached for the binder.

I gently placed my hand on it. “That’s for the Council to know, Melody. The binder is Sealed. Any attempts to open it without authorization will cause it to instantly burn. You know this.”

Her eyes widened and she yanked her hand back once I mentioned the Seal. “Nuh-uh. Nope. No way. I ain’t carrying *that* all the way back to the Collective.” She set her coffee down and started to walk away.

“There’s a *pound* of coffee in it for you,” I called out to her back.

She halted and bowed her head. “*Shit*.”

“*Two*, if you get it there in under a week.”

She spun on her heel and stormed back to the table, leaned over and jabbed a finger at my face. “You’re a real piece of shit, you know that, Wil?”

“This *has* to go, Melody. I’m sorry you pulled this straw; I really am. But this is *vital*.”

She straightened and threw her arms up. “*Fine*. I’ll get it there in under a week, but you’ll owe me more than just two pounds of coffee, Wil.” She took her mug and sipped more of the black brew.

“That’s fair. Let’s discuss terms, then.”

An hour later, I was packing up a small bag of various tech and had written a voucher for Melody to use to pull from my private stores back at the Collective. In all, she now had *three* pounds of coffee, four pounds of dried fruit and one of dried meat. This was on top of the provisions I gave her for the return trip. I sighed as she left. I’d need to visit the Collective myself, soon.

There was *no* way I’d attempt to subsist on the slop the people here ate.

I pulled out my ledger and began cataloguing my pantry. It would be a big help to know what I had and to get an idea of what I’d need.

“Let’s see… Powdered milk, eggs, flour…”

I was so focused on the task at hand, I barely heard the Wavenet phone chirping from the table. I rushed over to it, my stomach dropping through the ground, knowing the caller would *not* try again. I *had* to get to it fast.

“Hello?” I said breathlessly.

“*William. You sure took your fucking time.*”

“Sorry, Ma’am. I was making an inventory of my pantry. I plan to start the journey home next week.” I sat down heavily and took a sip from my cooling mug, my hand trembling slightly.

“*Oh? What did our Melody weasel out of you?*” I could *hear* the woman’s smirk.

“Just some coffee, dried fruit, dried meat and enough provisions for a week-long return trip.”

“*You know we supplied her for three weeks when she left on Tuesday, right?*”

That clever little bitch. I shook my head with a smile.

“No, Ma’am. I was unaware of that. She took me good, then. Anyway, how can I best help you, Ma’am?”

She snorted. “*I see. Well, it has to do with your…supplier. Have you heard from him since the lies they broadcast last week?*”

I remembered the day he showed up bloody, missing fingers *and* all but carrying a mostly unconscious woman who had lost an arm to my door. Hell of a thing. “No, Ma’am. To be honest, I expect to see him sometime today. Should I let you know if he doesn’t show?”

She was quiet for a moment. For the Councilwoman to be quiet was a rare thing. Her mind was razor-sharp, and she had *decades* of experience behind her. “*No, I think we will have surveillance set up completely in the next few days regardless.*”

“Surveillance? Ma’am, with all due respect, I’ve known this guy for seven years. He’s one of the *very* few I trust around here.”

“*Be that as it may, William, we will still pursue the matter of increased surveillance. At least until we are* ***certain*** *of his intentions.*”

“What more do you **need**, Councilwoman? He’s already agreed to do whatever is necessary to help.”

“*You have no need to know that information, William. But, because I trust your judgement -to a degree, anyway- I’ll let you know this: His Ai is unlike anything we have ever encountered. It is resisting all our attempts at securing a backdoor. This is what is causing the delay, but we have the absolute best on it. It’ll be cracked before you get here, I’m sure.*”

I blinked. Sure, Nova seemed a little *different*, but then, so was Ozzy. While not the *first* Shackled person I’d encountered like him, he was still unique. “As long as you don’t damage Nova, Councilwoman. I don’t want to see Ozzy hurt.”

“*Hurt him? Never, William. We need people like him among our ranks. Willingly, though. Can’t have the Shackled think they can only be part of the World if they’re* ***dragged*** *in.*”

I nodded and a knock sounded at the door. I rushed to the little peephole, seeing my friend outside.

In a hushed voice I said, “I have to go, Ma’am. He just showed up.”

“*Very well, William. I will see you when you get home.*” The line went dead and I slipped the phone into my pocket.

Opening the door, I put on my grumpiest face and looked at the kid in front of me. “Huh. So you’re alive? Get in here.”

I stepped to the side and Ozzy, the unwitting savior of the Nullborn, walked in.

I also admire how many people have turned it into a hunger strike. However, a lot of people are either scared or unable to participate for many different reasons, so I'm wondering if you have any ideas or suggestions for other things people coild give up in order to donate.

I have a few suggestions:
- haircuts 
- coffee/tea/energy drinks 
- ""treats"" (like boba tea or a sweet pastry)
- finding used versions of anything you would buy at full price and donate the rest
- going to the movies etc. (A plus if you go to a protest or volunteer instead)

Ideally these ""sacrifices"" also come with something that can start a conversation about why you're doing it. Like how I could explain the whole ""donate a meal"" thing if someone comments on my hair getting longer.

Epic Games Energy: Epic went to war with Apple and WON, kicked that 30% fee to the curb. Can we do that to Visa and Mastercard? They’re chargin us for EXISTIN. []



700+ Credit Score Flex: Yo, my credit score POPPIN, over 700, and I’m still gettin taxed like I’m broke. This ain’t right!! 😩

This is HORRIBLE, right? These companies just sittin there, stealin our money while we tryna live. Can we sue em like Epic did Apple? Or we just doomed to pay these fees forever?

My husband and I both work from home but I’m on maternity leave so I take care of the house and the baby for the most part right now. We’re trying not to take our son out until he’s 8 weeks (we were told if he gets a fever before that point it’s an automatic trip to the hospital so we’re just being cautious) so I’ve rarely left the house. I’m the type of person that hates being at home and that’s pretty much been my life recently. I of course know this is just part of being a parent to a newborn but I’m getting such cabin fever and getting burnt out from a constant cycle of feeding, dishes, laundry, cooking, etc. Now i’m also mentally exhausted from crying everyday. My husband is a wonderful partner but he’s been having to work late and had to work this weekend so I haven’t gotten a break and I’m at my breaking point.

Shit is expensive. That's when I came across Couchsurfing and it caught my eye. People hosting other people travelling? Sign me in. I had absolutely no effin idea what did I sign up for. What a load of crap.

Of course I read about what Couchsurfing is ""cultural exchange"", ""helping out fellow travellers"", ""connecting the world"", yeah yeah...bullshit, but I understood, that I shouldn't treat it as a free hotel. That made complete sense. Be kind, be nice, offer something in return, maybe cooking your national dish, show off your talent, get to know your host and make friends. They are providing their hospitality, which I am very gratefull of.... so I do what I can to return that favor to them, bring a gift, show them something, exchange stories, don't be pain in the ass.

There was a cool concert in neighbouring country, that I wanted to go. Yeah, not the big travel across the world, but i thought this will be my chance to try out Couchsurfing and see if I like the whole promise. So I look up the country, look up interesting people, read the profiles, read the references, and I pick out a few, that i think I might have a connection or something to talk about. I write a thoughtfull request for a day or two, send and.... nothing.

I was bummed out, cause hotel wasn't unfortunately in my budged, but allright. I am new, I have no references, maybe I had a bad luck, whatever. It's not the end of the world. 

Later I noticed there is a CS hangout in my country, so I thought it will be a great opportunity to network a little, ask around, maybe show them my requests and ask for tips. Man...was I surprised by the answers. 

If it was one dude, I would understand, that maybe he was an entitled prick, but several people said, that my requests are nice, but ""not in the spirit of Couchsurfing"". I was curious, so i asked them why. They started telling me, that it is a pretty big request from a random dude to be asking to stay at strangers home, that i should ask them for a coffee first and then see what's what. I was like WHAT? Yeah it is pretty big request to hit up a random person to stay at the house, THATS WHY I AM USING A PLATFORM FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE OPEN UP TO THAT. 

They told me, that Couchsurfing is about a cultural exchange. Okay, I admit that I am not some exotic stranger from halfway around the world, but like what? I am not asking to just crash, I made the effort to reach out to people, that had things in common, asked if they wanted to hang out if they had time, we could trade travel stories, visit interesting spots and so on. 

Also apparently I shouldn't ask in the request if they would host me directly, but rather tiptoe around that, with something like ""Regarding accommodation, I'm still looking for a place to stay for Friday and Saturday nights. If by any chance you are open to hosting, I would be incredibly grateful, but I completely understand if not. Either way, I'd still love to connect if our paths align."" 

Like okay, I am looking for a host, because I want to hang out with him? I mean yes I do, but if I could arrange a hotel, i wouldn't need a host. I could just facebook the dude and say ""hey, I am in XY, come hang out if you have the time, if not, cool."" Or maybe I am missing the point and it's the begging that gets them going.... i don't know. Like I am not a rude dude, i am grateful, when someone opens up their home for me, even if this post doesn't quite demonstrate that (not at all actually), but as per subreddit, I need to get this off my chest. 

I don't know, either I am really missing the point of Couchsurfing, or that platform is full of people with spoons stuck up their assess, just pretending to be humble and giving. I get the cultural meaning of it, but lets be straight, it is about saving money and be able to travel, get around to experience life.",1,1748896361.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

1l1smbp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l1smbp,Food and Grocery Diary for a DINK couple,"**High level stats:**
We are DINKS (47F and 50M), no pets. Both of us have fully remote super chill jobs (especially me) in technical roles, which means I have a lot of free time to cook and grocery shop. I looked up the median housing price here and it is mid $600s, that would make this a MCOL city I think? 

**How many meals do you typically prepare at home?**
I cook almost every lunch and dinner, sometimes breakfast too. There’s typically one eating out event once each weekend, either a friend’s house party, a family event, or we go eat out on our own. He enjoys cleaning as much as I love cooking and he always cleans up the kitchen each time. We use the dishwasher for everything including pots and pans. 

**Do you have any dietary requirements or goals?**
We enjoy all kinds of food but mainly asian cuisine and we love white rice, no dietary restrictions. I try to use minimally processed ingredients and have some sort of vegetables each meal. We both do not like to eat leftovers or the same thing twice in a row. I am not into meal prepping or cooking in big batches. I have the luxury of time and I love to cook, so I don’t need to be too efficient as I genuinely enjoy thinking about what to cook and the cooking process itself, I get into a flow, it’s like meditation. 

**What’s your most loved kitchen appliance and gadget?**
I love our portable induction cooktop which I use almost everyday. We set up a cooking station in the gazebo in our backyard and that’s where I do most of my cooking. No cooking grease inside the house! The weather here is mostly nice year round, it’s rare I am not able to cook outside. I love the induction cooktop because I can set the temperature more precisely and also use a timer which shuts itself off after the timer goes off. 

**What are your top three places to buy groceries?**
I have 4 favorite places, I like them all equally. Not all Safeways are created equal, our local Safeway is one of the best ones, new, spacious, bright and clean and has amazing weekly deals. I am a huge fan of Trader Joe’s for their snacks and dairy products, and I love Winco for their bulk bin snack items, produce, and meat at great prices. I also shop at an asian store but only once every few weeks as it is further away from home, although they will be opening a new branch close to home next year so I am super excited about that. On average I do one big grocery run once a week and a few smaller runs. Safeway and Trader Joe’s are both on the way back from our gym where I take group fitness classes on weekday mornings so it’s no big deal to stop by after class and it’s usually very quiet during those times. 

I try to capture our main meals for this diary but will skip the snacks. I stock our walk in pantry with snacks like dark chocolate, dried fruits, flax seed chips, roasted peanuts etc. We always eat our main meals together but snack on our own. 

A lot of the food I used this week was from the grocery I bought last week. We spent $135 on groceries for the last 7 days prior to the first day of this food journal. This week we spent $108 on groceries and $56 on eating out.

Breakfast:
I made one toasted bagel with cream cheese whipped with dried dill, thinly sliced red onions, capers, smoked salmon and we shared it. Sliced fresh strawberries. 2 Donut shop keurig coffee. 

Lunch:
I made stir fried chinese cauliflower and also Korean spicy ground beef. We ate it with rice, which is our go to starch. I bought the ground beef a couple weeks ago for $2.50/lb at Safeway. It was one of their weekly deals. It comes in a big 6 lb family pack so I divided it up into smaller 1 lb portions to freeze. I defrost one serving at a time as needed. The Chinese cauliflower was from an Asian grocery store for $3/lb. I much prefer it to regular cauliflower as it tastes sweeter and has a much less sulphur smell.

Dinner:
We attended a potluck party at the local public pickleball courts we regularly play pickleball at. Everyone is so nice and friendly there. We have become friends with some of them and do events together outside of pickleball. I am grateful for the courts and the community, it has added so much fun to our lives. Corn was on sale at Safeway, only 7 cents each! We bought 10 and I broke each corn into 2 halves, boiled it and sprinkled Trader Joe’s elote seasoning on it. They were popular and were all gone within minutes. We also brought some beer, and baked a frozen reduced sugar Marie Callender's apple pie which I bought on sale for $4. The crust was very buttery and flaky, the apple filling was generous but it did have a slight artificial sweetener aftertaste which I’m not a fan of. There were maybe 15 different items at the potluck party, half were homemade. I ate a bit of everything and had a beer. 

***Day 1 Total: $29.71***

Day 2:

Breakfast:
I made ham and cheese on a toasted bagel for breakfast and we shared it.

Lunch:
I made 2 big plates of stir fried vegetables asian style - oyster mushrooms, chinese cauliflower, wood ear mushrooms, cabbage, snow peas, lotus roots and thinly sliced pork. We ate it with steamed rice. I also sliced up the rest of the strawberries I bought yesterday. Everyday I go through the fridge to see what fruits and vegetables need to be eaten and I plan our meals accordingly. 

Dinner:
I made tong ho (chrysanthemum greens) goma-ae. I blanched the leaves then squeezed out the water and seasoned it with soy sauce, sesame oil and mirin. It’s a great way to eat a lot of greens as it shrinks down a lot. For the main entree I made a spicy chinese cumin lamb.  It’s one of his favorite dishes. He went out to get us 2 slices of my favorite pistachio cake (***$12***) earlier today while I was napping. What a sweet surprise. We finished everything and felt so stuffed and took a nice 12 minute walk on nicely paved and landscaped walkways to our local park where the pickleball courts are at. It’s a lovely huge park with 2 dog parks, a soccer field, huge playground, tennis and pickleball courts. I love seeing all the kids and folks laughing and enjoying themselves. It's a very diverse and tolerant community and it’s a very heartwarming scene.  I feel very grateful to live in such a nice neighborhood.

Day 3:

Went to Safeway twice today.

|Safeway||
| --- | --- |
|French bread |$2|
|Ice cream |$6|
|Safeway Total |$8|

Breakfast:
I had a small bowl of heritage cereal (Trader Joe’s) and almond granola (Winco bulk bin) with oat milk before my bollywood zumba class this morning. Stopped by Safeway after class to pick up a loaf of french bread ($2) for lunch. He skipped breakfast and only had a cup of keurig coffee, which costs about $0.40 per pod. We buy it in bulk on sale from [Staples.com](http://Staples.com), free delivery. 

Lunch:
I made italian sausages with onions and bell peppers and canned tomatoes. I love this brand called “New York Style Sausage Company” and it was on sale for 2 packs for $8 at Safeway last week. That’s 10 sausages and I usually use 2-3 sausages per meal so that $8 will last us for 3 meals. I made 2 big sandwiches with it and sprinkled feta cheese and parsley on top. It was very delicious and filling. Made myself a pour-over coffee with frothed milk.

Late night snack:
We only played 4 games of pickleball this evening at our private club but they were really good games with lots of rallies. I was the only female and we played against 3 different mens teams. We won the last 3 games and felt really happy with the way we played and decided we deserve a treat and bought ourselves some Haagen Dazs ice cream at Safeway. They were on sale for $3 per pint. We got pistachio and coffee chocolate brownie ice cream. We had a scoop of each with some almond granola. 

I also prepared a mini loaf of french toast using the leftover french bread and added a couple scoops of the pistachio ice cream for breakfast tomorrow.

***Day 3 Total: $8***

Day 4:

Breakfast:
I baked the french toast casserole which had been sitting in the fridge overnight. The mini loaf pan is so adorable! It was a genius idea to add the pistachio ice cream, it turned out delicious and we both loved it. 

Lunch:
I made fettuccine pasta with oyster mushrooms, spicy italian sausage and blue cheese and cream cheese sauce. Simple but flavorful.

Dinner:
I made pan fried pork marinated in Indonesian sweet soy sauce, lime juice, coriander powder, thai chili and ginger. Second dish is bitter melon and eggs, this isn’t for everyone. I love bitter melons but he doesn’t. Ate with steamed white rice.

Late night snack:
We played pickleball after dinner at an indoor club 40 minutes away from home and got home late and was hungry. I had prepped another mini loaf of french toast just before dinner and I popped it in the toaster oven while we took a shower. Freshly baked warm french toast with Haagen Dazs Coffee Chocolate Brownie ice cream, a heavenly match. We definitely got our money's worth out of the Safeway $2 french bread.

Breakfast:
I boiled some Hawaiian purple potatoes that we bought last week. These are the most gorgeous dark purple and are sweet. It gave me plenty of energy to do my aerobics step class. Did a trader joe’s run after class ($18.40), no wait at the cashier. 

Lunch:
I made a sort of Japanese Bento style lunch. Pan fried sake and mirin steelhead trout, leftover chrysanthemum green salad and pork, and miso seaweed soup served with steamed rice. Cara cara oranges for dessert. He really loved this lunch, I always love hearing his compliments.

Dinner:
We had an early dinner at a taqueria. I love their unlimited tortilla chips bar with all the different salsas, especially their nopales salad. It was happy hour prices and the total came to **$22.03**.

Late night snack:
I made a Chinese style dessert which will probably seem a bit strange to most people. Typically it’s made using soy milk or water sweetened with rock sugar but we prefer oat milk. All you have to do is add a bunch of toppings to the milk and we used almond jelly, hawaiian purple potato, canned orange segments and crushed ice. Summer is here and we definitely will be making more of this type of dessert.

Breakfast:
One Trader Joe’s hash brown, one egg and cheese each. We made the 40 minute drive again to the indoor pickleball club. The pickleball community here is small and we always meet familiar faces and it’s fun to have small chats here and there.  

Lunch:
We ate at a food court close to the pickleball club and each had a bowl of Guilin style chinese noodles (**$34.32**). We bumped into another pickleball couple while eating there and had a quick friendly chat. Pickleball has indeed added so much fun to our lives. There’s an asian grocery store nearby and we do another quick run for the family dinner (**$34.22**) that I will be cooking for tomorrow (7 people). 

Afternoon snack:
He made us a mixed berries smoothie. Perfect for a hot afternoon.

Dinner:
Made 2 dishes with steamed rice. First is stir fried cabbage with bacon with szechuan chili oil and black vinegar. Very simple but we both really loved it. Ginger pork with onions, a bit too heavy on the ginger.

Late night snack:
Another one of our cold chinese sweet soup desserts, this time we used oat milk with canned rambutan, almond jelly, canned oranges and a splash of elderberry liquor.

Spent the morning cooking for the family dinner tonight (for 7 people) while he did his weekly house cleaning. He enjoys cleaning as much as I love cooking. I have never been to a house cleaner or more minimalistic than ours.  Lunch is just a small meal of leftover rice and leftover ginger pork. He did weight lifting while I took a yoga class at the gym. A power nap before  an early dinner with the family. 

Dinner:
We brought the food to his parents house and reheated the food there. I made egg tofu with eggs and mushrooms, black pepper beef with green peppers, chipotle shrimp, chrysanthemum greens salad, boiled corn. We ate it with steamed rice. His sister bought taiyaki from Somi somi and wine. I loved the taiyakis. Everyone enjoyed the food and we finished everything.

I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

The two music artists are Joost Klein and Tommy Cash! 

1. Macchiato Elliot 

Inspired by Tommy Cash

Outfit: Half black and brown suit, white and light brown shirt and red tie

Pizza will be a takeaway cup from cafe’s like starbucks or costa coffee 

2. Europa Elliot

Inspired by Joost Klein

Outfit: A white shirt with Joost’s signature blue suit and glasses!

1l1sjrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget_hacksfor20s/comments/1l1sjrw/i_found_117_in_my_life_i_didnt_know_i_had/,I found $117 in my life I didn’t know I had,"So I did a dumb little experiment this week.

I treated my life like a subscription service. Literally just went through everything I do, use, eat, or spend money on as if I was paying for a monthly plan—because in a way, I am.

Here’s what I “unsubscribed” from:
	•	A gym I never go to but kept “just in case” — $29/month
	•	A “free trial” from March I forgot to cancel — $14.99/month
	•	My auto-renew DoorDash Pass (I barely use it) — $9.99/month
	•	Monthly “therapy” apps I open once every 3 months — $12/month
	•	Starbucks 3x/week (yep, I calculated it) — ~$51/month

Total: $117/month basically gone for nothing.

I replaced it with:
	•	YouTube workouts
	•	Walking with friends like it’s 2007
	•	Making iced coffee at home like a broke genius
	•	Actually texting people instead of “therapy journaling into the void”
	•	Remembering I own food and don’t need it delivered in 14 minutes

Point is: your budget isn’t always about making more money. Sometimes it’s just about unsubscribing from stuff you’ve been auto-paying with your attention, time, or dopamine cravings.

Try it. You might find $117 hiding in plain sight too.

1l1sit1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l1sit1,Middle of Day 5 - working through challenges and roadblocks,"Thank you to everyone for all of the upvotes and supportive comments on my previous post. I'm fasting to try to help - and hopefully even cure - an inflammatory health issue that I've been suffering from for a year and a half that has severely impacted my life in every way. I'm now into Day 5 and working through some difficulties with the fast.

At the very tail end of Day 3, I was hit with debilitating sluggishness and I knew it was time for electrolytes. I mixed up an LMNT packet as described, but unfortunately, I just could not choke the drink down. It did not agree with me at all. They are the flavored packets (zero calories is of course ideal, but I'm okay with 5-10 strategic calories per day if it helps keep me going). I've used these before on my 24 hour fasts, even though I didn't feel I needed them for such a short fast. I didn't have a problem with them previously, but I simply couldn't tolerate it this time.

My partner suggested some pickle juice, and a shot of that perked me RIGHT up to end Day 3.

Day 4 yesterday the terrible sluggishness was really pervasive and I started to feel the irritability creep in as well. Tried again to mix up and drink an LMNT packet, but it was a total no-go. I sipped on pickle juice throughout yesterday for sodium and ordered some magnesium Epsom salt and low-dose potassium gluconate tablets, both of which arrived this morning.

Started Day 5 today with a tiny bit of black coffee, a magnesium Epsom salt bath, a potassium tablet, and a pickle juice shot. I feel ever so slightly better, but I know that is definitely not enough for my daily levels. I'm going to have to keep trying to figure something out, but I am also have to see what I can even tolerate.

I'm committed, I'm in it, but I have to adjust and pivot a bit in terms of my electrolytes. If I still feel so unbearably sluggish this evening, I'll try a cup of bouillon. Again, I don't mind negligible calories if it means I can keep the fast going.

Thanks again to this sub for the support. Reading through everyone's posts is so helpful. It's been a great resource.",2,1748895593.0,fasting,3,1.0,False
1l1sif9,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1l1sif9/do_your_espresso_beans_ever_turn_their_back_on_you/,Do your espresso beans ever turn their back on you?,"Hi,
I work at a coffee shop where we switch espresso beans every day. We take about 20 minutes to make a recipe every morning, even if we have an old recipe from a few days ago written down as a guide. We always adjust our recipe, every day. 

We find most of the coffee beans we use change SO MUCH throughout the day. Within 30 minutes, the espresso can go from dreamy to awful. It means we change our grind size all the time, which means there is a fair amount of waste every time we “purge” the grinder. And most importantly we are soooo caffeinated. We spit out everything we taste test, but on a bad day (usually when the weather is wet or changing, and also often when we use Ethiopian coffees, especially naturals) sometimes we’ll taste like 40 cups throughout the day! 
Is this normal???

We completely disassemble and clean our coffee grinder every week. Every day we rinse our portafilters regularly, open and wipe them at midday, we backflush as often as we are able to… 

It just feels like sometimes the coffee is moody and decides to turn its back on us! Like come on I have 10 espresso orders coming up!!! Gather yourself!

How much do you taste test? How picky are you with your espresso? How do you make it more stable? Is this normal?? Are there beans we should entirely avoid? Should we just relax?

Thanks so much for your expert answers!!",4,1748895568.0,barista,4,0.99,False

Or just silly?,"My girl will NOT stop grabbing cups and chewing on the straws. She keeps knocking them over due to how voracious she's chewing on them. She's about a year old and she's been doing this for the past few months. It don't seem like she's in pain, but I know some animals teeth when their teeth hurt, and I also heard they sometimes mimick people drinking water by chewing on straws and grabbing cups like she is. I drink from straws a lot and she keeps finding whatever cup I just grabbed and either 1) chewing the straw, 2) grabbing the cup, 3) drinking RIGHT FROM IT. 6/10 times, she knocks over the cup (usually unintentionally, but I've caught her doing it to catch my attention once or twice too).

She likes MY cups so much that she won't drink from the massive bowl she has (it's literally bigger than my ~85 pound GSD's food bowl, and she eats like a monster because she's so active). I thought maybe she wasn't drinking from her bowl because of our tap water (it's not very good and sometimes even gets health regulations sent out, so we as a family drink from bottled water unfortunately) so I switched her to leftover bottled water but it doesn't seem to have made that much of a difference. She'll drink from the bowl if I have JUST poured water, or if she's coming out of her kennel when we get home (I kennel her for safety if I'm not around her because she's VERY good at getting into dangerous situations) and very thirsty, but beyond that, she ONLY wants *my* water.

So is she teething? Mimicking? Just being a freak? She is so orange she's red, so I'm inclined to think she just permanently lacks the brain cell unfortunately.

There's nothing particularly dangerous about what she's doing (coffee, tea, and juice don't entice her and I never drink alcohol, so it's only the water she's drinking) thankfully but it's really gross and I hate picking up spilled water 24/7. Plus, I have an extremely elderly incontinent and clumsy dog who has to have puppy mats laid down so pick up is easy, and the water turns the mats gross and they need to be thrown out which is... expensive. And, it SUCKS when it's like 3 am and I'm dehydrated and I hear her lapping at MY water. Like baby you have fresh water 3 feet away from you!! Stop it 😭😭",1,1748895172.0,CatAdvice,3,1.0,False
