====================================================================

Ah, dog breath! It’s one of those quirks of canine companionship that can range from downright charming to completely overwhelming. You know what I’m talking about: that unmistakable aroma that wafts your way when your furry friend decides to show some affection. Whether it's morning kisses or a slobbery ball retrieval, we love our dogs, but sometimes their breath could use a bit of help—or maybe even a complete makeover. If you've ever scratched your head wondering how to get dogs bad breath, you’re certainly in the right spot. Let’s dive deep into this aromatic abyss and explore the causes, remedies, and ways to embrace this unique canine quirk.

Understanding Canine Breath: What’s That Smell?
-----------------------------------------------

Before diving into how to get dogs bad breath (as counterintuitive as it sounds), we first need to understand what creates those foul odors. Just like humans, a dog’s mouth is a bustling ecosystem of bacteria. However, in a healthy scenario, these bacteria keep each other in check. When things go awry—like poor dental hygiene, digestive issues, or certain diets—you may find yourself dealing with the odoriferous effects.

### Factors Behind Bad Dog Breath

1. **Buildup of Tartar and Plaque**: Dogs don't brush their teeth (obviously!), so plaque can build up quickly if dental care isn’t prioritized. This buildup hardens into tartar, leading to gum disease and a soup of unpleasant scents.
2. **Dental Diseases**: Simple gingivitis can escalate into more serious dental diseases like periodontitis. These ailments not only lead to discomfort but also release abominable smells.
3. **Diet**: Just as what you eat affects your own smell, your pup's diet plays a significant role here too. Certain foods may leave lingering odors, especially if they contain fish or pungent proteins.
4. **Oral Infections**: Sometimes, an infection in your dog's mouth can be the culprit. This could come from a broken tooth or a foreign object lodged between teeth, creating a stinky situation.
5. **Underlying Health Issues**: Occasionally, bad breath can signal larger health issues, such as kidney disease or diabetes. Yes, your dog's breath is a window into their overall health.

Tips for Embracing Bad Breath
-----------------------------

So, you’ve taken stock of what might be causing your dog’s less-than-rosy breath. Rather than wave a magic wand to banish it entirely, let’s instead revel in our pups’ charm by embracing their breath!

### Celebrate the Quirkiness

Why fight it? Bad breath can be an amusing conversation starter at the dog park. Just imagine the laughs you’d share over a cup of coffee while regaling tales of your dog’s “unique” oral essence. Here are some ways to celebrate:

- **Create a Signature Scent**: You can even give your dog's breath a quirky name. “Eau de Rover” or “Paw-sitively Pungent,” anyone?
- **Photo Ops**: Capturing that cute face right after a big yawn can lead to hilariously awkward moments. Everyone loves a good laugh!

### Treating Bad Breath—and Having a Good Time!

While we're having fun, it’s also essential to consider proper care and treatment for your pup's oral hygiene. Here's where you might want to take some actionable steps.

1. **Regular Teeth Brushing**: Yes, it sounds like a lot of work, but brushing your dog’s teeth a few times a week (or daily if you're feeling ambitious) can dramatically reduce bad breath. Use dog-friendly toothpaste!
2. **Dental Chews**: Give 'em something to chew on! Dental chews can help break down plaque and keep your dog's teeth cleaner. It’s like munching popcorn while watching a movie—you feel good about it!
3. **Water Additives**: These nifty little liquids can be added to your dog's water bowl to help freshen breath and reduce plaque. They’re like a refreshing drink for your pup!
4. **Vet Check-Ups**: Regular check-ups are non-negotiable. Your vet can identify potential underlying issues and recommend solutions, keeping you from going down the rabbit hole of home remedies that don’t work.
5. **Interactive Dental Toys**: Keep your pup entertained and clean their teeth simultaneously with toys designed to promote dental health. It’s a win-win situation!

When to Seek Professional Help
------------------------------

You might wonder, “How to get dogs bad breath under control?” Well, if the stench persists or seems particularly severe, it’s time to dog paddle into professional territory. Here’s why consulting your vet may be the best course of action:

### Signs It's Time to Visit the Vet

- **Persistent or Unusual Odor**: If your dog’s breath smells like garbage or has a sweet, fruity scent, it might indicate something far more serious.
- **Difficulty Eating**: If your pup starts hesitating to eat or shows signs of discomfort, it’s time to investigate further.
- **Drooling and Swelling**: Increased drooling coupled with swelling in the mouth or gums can signal serious dental issues.
- **Changes in Habits**: If your dog becomes lethargic or develops digestion issues alongside the bad breath, it might be a sign of underlying problems; best not to ignore it!

Home Remedies for Bad Breath (That Actually Work)
-------------------------------------------------

Now, let’s dig deeper into how to get dogs bad breath under control without going overboard on costs. Home remedies can be quite effective while still being gentle on your wallet. Here are some tried-and-true methods:

### DIY Dental Rinses

Creating a homemade dental rinse is simpler than you think! Here's how you can do it:

- **Ingredients**:
- 1 cup of water
- 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon of coconut oil (optional)
- **Instructions**:

1. Mix the ingredients in a bowl.
2. Use a cotton ball to dab this mixture onto your dog's teeth.
3. Do this a couple of times a week to help with their breath.

### Fresh Herbs for Fresh Breath

Certain herbs can work wonders for your dog's mouth. Try adding the following to their diet:

- **Parsley**: This popular herb helps neutralize odors. Just sprinkle a little on their food, and voila!
- **Mint**: Like parsley, mint leaves can act as a natural breath freshener. Just make sure it’s safe for dogs.

### Baking Soda Brilliance

Yep, baking soda isn’t just for cookies. It can also act as a natural deodorizer! Just mix a pinch into their food a few times a week. It’s like hitting the refresh button!

### Yogurt to the Rescue

Plain, unsweetened yogurt can help promote good bacteria in your dog's mouth, combating the bad guys. Just make sure it’s dog-friendly and given in moderation!

### Carrots for a Crunch

Last but not least, crunchy carrots can scrub their teeth while acting as a tasty treat. It’s nature’s toothbrush!

Fun Alternatives: Dental Treats and Chews
-----------------------------------------

While we’re all about the home remedy vibes, sometimes you just want to buy something off the shelf that’s both fun and great for your dog's breath. Here are some fun recommendations:

1. **Commercial Dental Chews**: Brands like Greenies or Whimzees are designed to help your dog clean their teeth while chewing. They’re like the fast food version of dental care!
2. **Raw Bones**: If your vet gives the green light, raw bones can help with teeth cleaning and provide hours of entertainment.
3. **Freeze-Dried Treats**: These treats are great for dental health and freshness. Plus, they come in various flavors, so you can keep your pup guessing. Yum!
4. **Long-Lasting Chews**: Look for chews made of natural ingredients that last longer and help with plaque and tartar buildup as they chew.

### Embrace Regular Dental Check-Ups

And let’s not forget! Regular vet visits are key. Making dental care a part of your dog's health regime is vital. Just like we visit the dentist every six months, your dog deserves the same attention!

Preparing for a Fresh Breath Revolution
---------------------------------------

Now, after all this talk about how to get dogs bad breath in check, you might feel overwhelmed. But it’s time to arm yourself with knowledge and tools to embark on this adventure towards sweet-smelling success!

### Take Inventory of Supplies

Before starting your mission, gather a list of supplies you’ll need:

- Dog toothbrush and toothpaste
- Dental chews
- Water additives
- Quality dog food
- Raw bones (if allowed)

### Develop a Routine

Like any good habit, consistency is key. Consider establishing a daily routine for your pup that incorporates the steps we've discussed, such as:

1. **Daily Brush**: Start or end your day with a tooth brushing session.
2. **Regular Treats**: Incorporate dental chews and healthy foods into their meals.
3. **Water Refresh**: Make it a point to change their water daily to encourage drinking and rinsing away debris.
4. **Health Check**: Monitor your dog’s breath regularly and schedule vet check-ups as needed.

Conclusion: Kiss the Stink Goodbye!

1hgt8h3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Barnesandnoble/comments/1hgt8h3/are_my_feelings_valid/,are my feelings valid?,"i had a random encounter with a ""customer"" that kinda made me uncomfortable. while browsing books during my break, this girl in the same section starts talking to me about the books i was looking at. we were talking for a while just about our favorite books and then she tells me she works at \*b&n store name\*. in my head i was like ""okay, whatever"" but the convo slowly started shifting to her asking me  about my feelings about working for b&n. in my head i was like ""this girl seems sweet so i'll just tell her, why not?"" i start telling her i enjoy it ,but because i'm cross-trained, i'm never really on the book floor anymore. she empathized with me and started asking me some other random things about my store, and was like ""yes, i understand. my store delt with the same things! have you about the benefits of unionizing?"" 

something i should mention, i started working here in 2023, when i was 16. i don't know a ton about unions, but all i know is that i don't plan on working here for the rest of my life. most likely, if my store got unionized, i would already be away for college. however, in august of '23 and august of this year, i was receiving text messages from these b&n employees i didn't know, who worked at unionized stores. these texts always say something like ""hey (my name)! let me know when your free to talk and we can grab a cup of coffee or talk over the phone!' i never responded to the messages, so they resorted to calling me instead 😭. i just feel like their being so pushy about it. i don't mind learning about this whole unionizing thing, but i didn't want them to call me and then later give me no choice but to talk to you in person lol. also, my parents would freak out if they knew these random people are texting me asking to meet up for coffee. anyway, back to this convo i was having with this girl, she wouldn't stop talking. i just kinda stood their standing awkwardly the whole time and nodding my head until i was like bro i gotta get back to work. and one of the main reasons why this interaction made me so uncomfortable is because of what i told the senior bookseller at my work, who is so so amazing!! when my coworker brought up the topic of unionizing and asked if i was interested, i told her, ""i don't want to talk to anyone from a different store, but if you or \_\_\_ could keep me in the loop about important updates i will definitely consider and appreciate it! 😊"" she was like ""100% understand, no problem!"" she TOLD the other people involved in the unionizing process to not involve me, and to NOT approach me at the store (i was wearing my name tag when i was approached). 

i just wanna know, am i valid for feeling this way? yes, i'm fine with learning more about it, but don't trick me into giving u some info about my store to then corner me about it lol. thank you for reading my story/rant 😔

Today was my last day of highschool (hurray me) so I have been up since 7am running around school getting things situated. Strike number one. After that, my boyfriend and I (who was doing the same thing I was doing today at school) went to a coffee shop. However we had a rough moment that of course I dont even remember because I never remember what the bad stuff is about, i just remember the feelings. Strike two. I then go into work at 3pm, getting off at 10:30pm. Today is what we call truck day, hence we get a big truck we have to unload. It was literally just me and my one other coworker. He was working the truck and I was trying to help but of course, i had a lot of customers. That’s whatever, fine, it’s how retail is. Lines and lines of customers my whole shift. Around 8pm it starts to slow, im putting stuff up, what not. I see a lady with a buggy walk away from the register so I figure I have enough time to take a short break because my feet and back were killing me and I wanted to respond to my texts. I sit down in the break room. Not even a minute later she is looking into the break room and with severe attitude goes “are you going to ring me up? Are you even working? You’re just sitting there on your phone.” I end up rolling my eyes (mainly at the fact I had just sat down). Obviously she gets more upset and is like “I’ve been waiting here for minutes and you’re just sitting in there not doing anything.” I snap back “it was NOT minutes, I saw you a few seconds ago going the other way.” I don’t exactly remember the order of what else was said but I know I started cussing at her and she kept criticizing me and shit. “You need to learn how to talk to people, im calling corporate” blah blah. I yell at her like “im a fucking person too I haven’t sat down in 5 fucking hours” and what not. I explain that I have not had a break since I’ve been at work. My coworker and I were supposed to take a break but with him needing to put up merchandise and me tending to the customers it was not happening. So yeah I had been standing and dealing with customers for the entire time I was there, no break, craving a damn smoke. The switch just went off in my head and I could not stop arguing with this lady. It was bad. I ended up walking away bc she was like “I know (my coworker) im getting him.” Bc I told her “can you just fucking pay.” lol but yea she got him and I was in the break room chilling out. Yeahhh she totally called corporate. Which of course i don’t blame her. But damn basically im just sharing this to say I fucking hate BPD lolz because once something sets me off I just can not snap out of it. I have to finish it to like idk “win” or something idfk. Also I’d like to point out we have a bell for customers to ring they are just fucking blind. Literally says ring the bell for cashier. Oh well. I hate customer service. Im always so nice to people I swear, but this day was not it and I just fucking snapped. Ended up on the bathroom floor hyperventilating bc I didn’t know wtf just happened and also was js thinking about how I’m gonna be like this forever. Blowing up on people over small shit. I mean in the psych ward (lolz) they put me on some meds that kind of help but also not really at the same time.  It’s crazy to think about how my mom has BPD as well and i always swore to never be like her. She’s a nice and caring person until she blows up. Then forgets it even happened. Now im exactly like her. It’s greaaaaat. My bf can just say a word or his tone is off and I just snap at him or shut down and I can not stand it. I want so badly to be normal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening is an increasingly popular cosmetic treatment that many individuals are turning to for a brighter smile. Whether you’re preparing for a special occasion or simply want to enhance your everyday appearance, understanding the transformative effects of before and after teeth whitening can be incredibly beneficial.

Before undergoing teeth whitening, you might have concerns about how effective the process will be and what results you can realistically expect. Many people find that their teeth appear dull or stained due to factors like diet, age, or habits such as smoking. These conditions can lead to a sense of self-consciousness, making teeth whitening an appealing option for improving confidence.

One of the most significant changes you'll notice after teeth whitening is the immediate brightness of your smile. This change can create a more youthful appearance, often helping individuals feel more attractive and approachable. The boost in confidence can extend beyond how you feel about your appearance; it can influence social interactions, professional relationships, and even personal achievements.

When contemplating a teeth whitening treatment, you can expect either in-office procedures or at-home options. Each method has advantages, depending on your preferences and needs.

- **In-office treatments:** These are usually performed by dental professionals and can yield faster, more dramatic results. Using professional-grade bleaching agents, in-office procedures can brighten teeth up to several shades in just one visit.
- **At-home kits:** Teeth whitening kits can provide convenience and a degree of customization. You may use trays, strips, or pens that allow you to apply the whitening agent at your leisure, but results may take longer to achieve compared to in-office treatments.

Regardless of the method chosen, the results can be striking. The before and after photos of teeth whitening are often used to illustrate the effectiveness of the treatment. In many instances, teeth can shift from a yellowish or brownish tint to a radiant white, instantly changing your smile's appearance. These visual transformations can be quite motivating—it’s rewarding to see such clear, positive results.

Another essential aspect to consider post-treatment is maintenance. Once you've achieved your desired whiteness, keeping your smile bright will require some diligence. Here are a few tips to help prolong your results:

- Avoid foods and drinks that cause staining, like red wine, coffee, and berries.
- Maintain a regular oral hygiene routine that includes brushing twice a day and flossing.
- Consider touch-up treatments or whitening toothpaste designed specifically to help maintain brightness.

Many individuals also report significant psychological benefits after teeth whitening. The confidence gained from a whiter smile can lead to increased self-esteem, encouraging you to smile more often. This simple act can create a positive feedback loop: the more you smile, the happier you feel, which can enhance social interactions and boost your mood.

It’s also wise to have realistic expectations. While professional teeth whitening can produce impressive results, individual outcomes may vary based on factors such as the original shade of your teeth, the whitening method used, and your overall dental health. Some people may require multiple sessions to reach their desired brightness, while others may be satisfied after just one treatment.

In closing, the transformative effects of before and after teeth whitening are profound. You'll likely experience immediate cosmetic benefits and an enhanced self-image, leading to broader positive changes in your life. Many find that investing in a brighter smile opens doors to new experiences and relationships, reinforcing the value of taking that first step towards achieving a radiant smile.

Teeth whitening is more than just a cosmetic procedure; it is an investment in your confidence and well-being, proving that a brilliant smile can indeed transform your life.

Top Strategies for Maintaining Your Smile After Teeth Whitening
---------------------------------------------------------------

After achieving a bright, radiant smile through teeth whitening, maintaining that stunning look can be just as crucial as the initial whitening process. You want your smile to shine for a long time, and with the right strategies, you can protect your investment. Here are some top strategies to help you preserve the brilliance of your newly whitened teeth.

### Stay Hydrated

Drinking plenty of water is one of the simplest yet most effective strategies for maintaining your pearly whites. After whitening, your enamel may be temporarily more porous, making it easier for stains to settle in. By drinking water throughout the day, you can help wash away food particles and beverages that could cause discoloration. Aim to:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- Drink at least eight glasses of water daily.
- Rinse your mouth with water after consuming staining foods or drinks.
- Use a straw for beverages that are known to stain, like coffee or tea.

### Be Mindful of Your Diet

Your diet plays a significant role in maintaining your whitening results. Some foods and beverages can lead to staining. It's advisable to limit or avoid:

- **Coffee and Tea:** Both are known for their potential to stain teeth due to their dark hues.
- **Red Wine:** Rich in tannins and color, red wine can dull your brighter smile.
- **Colored Sauces:** Items like soy sauce and tomato sauce are notorious for their staining properties.
- **Dark Berries:** While healthy, blueberries and blackberries can lead to discoloration.

Instead, focus on:

- **Crunchy Fruits and Vegetables:** Apples, carrots, and celery can help scrub your teeth.
- **Cheese:** Dairy can actually help protect your enamel and prevent stains.
- **Watermelon and Strawberries:** These lighter fruits are less likely to cause discoloration.

### Maintain Good Oral Hygiene

Good oral hygiene is a crucial part of keeping your smile bright. After whitening, continue to follow a diligent dental care routine:

- **Brush at Least Twice a Day:** Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and non-abrasive toothpaste.
- **Floss Daily:** Flossing removes food particles that a toothbrush may miss.
- **Use Mouthwash:** An anti-cavity mouthwash can protect your enamel and freshen your breath.

### Consider Touch-Up Treatments

Just like any beauty treatment, teeth whitening isn’t permanent. Depending on your lifestyle and preferences, consider touch-up treatments to maintain your smile's brightness:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Over-the-Counter Whiteners:** Whitening toothpaste or strips can help remove surface stains.
- **Professional Touch-Ups:** Schedule appointments with your dentist every six months to a year for a professional touch-up.

### Limit Tobacco Use

If you smoke or use tobacco, it's crucial to understand the impact on your teeth. Tobacco products are among the biggest offenders when it comes to causing stains. Limiting or quitting tobacco use can benefit not just your dental health but your overall well-being. If you find it challenging to quit, seek support from a healthcare professional.

### Regular Dental Check-Ups

Frequent visits to your dentist can help monitor the health of your teeth and gums. They can provide professional cleanings that remove any stubborn stains and maintain your smile’s brightness. Ensure you:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- Visit your dentist at least twice a year for check-ups and cleanings.
- Discuss any concerns about staining or your dental health with your dentist.

With the right care and attention, you can maintain your beautiful smile after teeth whitening. From staying hydrated to being cautious with your diet and maintaining good oral hygiene, these simple strategies will keep you smiling brightly for years to come.

### Conclusion

The journey to a brighter smile can be truly remarkable, as the transformative effects of teeth whitening reveal a new level of confidence and radiance. Seeing the before and after teeth whitening results can be astonishing. You may find that a whiter smile not only enhances your appearance but also boosts your self-esteem in social and professional environments. It’s important to clearly understand what to expect when undergoing this treatment so that it aligns with your personal goals and enhances your daily life.

However, achieving that stunning smile is just the first step. The key to maintaining your beautiful results lies in adopting effective strategies. After teeth whitening, you can keep your smile vibrant for longer by following simple guidelines, such as avoiding stain-causing foods and beverages and practicing diligent oral hygiene. Regular dental check-ups and touch-up treatments can also help preserve your results.

Strongest best smelling fragrance.,"I'd like to be able to spray my stuffed animals with a pleasant scent that lasts a long time but I don't know where to start looking. I did just get some tester perfumes but I don't know what brands they are which is frustrating because I love some of them as they last all day and smell amazing. 

Things I personally enjoy smelling: pumpkin, coffee, ""clean laundry"" (fresh linen I think is what it's commonly called), some tropical scents, floral scents, Victoria secret perfume (I think it's called Love spell?), some wood smells  tonka and sage. 

I don't like: vanilla (although it depends on the blend because I do like sugar cookie which is extremely similar), strong lavender, sometimes I don't like cherry blossom but it depends on the blend. Those are all I can think of at the moment.

1hgt2a5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1hgt2a5/every_year_theres_a_new_surprise_from_my/,"Every year, there's a new surprise from my divorce...and I'm still devastated.","Let me start by saying that I know my problems are not anything compared to some people in the world.  But I have been stuck in the abyss since my wife left...4 years ago.

I'm sorry if this post is overly wordy, but I wanted to give the story context and will try to hit some highlights.  I've tried a lot of things to help myself get better, but I keep getting lost in the absolute sadness.

In 2013, I was a 30-year-old man who met a 27-year-old woman on a dating app (at the time, it was much less common than it has become today).  We seemed to have a lot in common - our parents were immigrants, we had similar senses of humor, we enjoyed many of the same things, we both relatively quiet/reserved - and we felt comfortable with each other.  I was in the middle of my Urology residency at the time and she was a physical therapist who had recently graduated a couple years earlier.  Things were great - we loved spending time with each other and got along amazingly well - pretty typical story, so far.

The only disagreements we had during this time were about my time spent at work - as a surgical resident, you have very early mornings and don't have a lot of control over when you can go home sometimes - I explained to her that things typically get better as time goes on.  But, this never caused any big fights.  About 1 year into the relationship, we are talking about going on vacation together and she says, ""oh, I've never gone on a vacation with a boyfriend...I can't wait.""  A few days later, we are logged into a travel website on her computer and a different guy's name auto-populates into the login space.  Let me be clear - I didn't care that she had dated other people in the past, obviously, but I was curious as to why a random guy's name was in a travel website, when she had ""never gone on vacation with a boyfriend.""  I ask her about it and she says, ""oh, that's from when my ex and I went to New York city for a festival.""  This was our first real argument - I was upset about the strange fact that she lied - not when I asked her something specific, but rather she voluntarily told a lie for absolutely no reason.

We move on and things are fine.  This whole time, we're going out, exploring the city (Philly), visiting her parents who live about 2-3 hours away, spending all of our free time together, etc.  But there were multiple other incidents over time where it was clear that she was being dishonest about random things - not about anything important, per se, but the fact that she was being shady bothered me...especially when I had always stressed to her that she could tell me anything and honesty was so important to [me.](http://me.My)  But each separate incident was such a little lie, that it would seem crazy for me to end a long-term relationship over it.

One night, we go out for my birthday - about 2.5 years into dating.  While out at a speakeasy, she starts trying to make conversation.  ""What was your favorite first date?""  She goes on to explain a date with someone who clearly was not me, which was weird, but okay.  Then she says, ""don't you think tattoos are hot? Like a guy with sleeve tattoos.""  Mind you, I have no tattoos myself, but her ex-boyfriend did have a couple.  She then says ""do you think that girl is hot?"" pointing to someone else at the bar.  Trying to be a good boyfriend, I say ""no, you're the hottest one in here.  You're not checking out other guys, are you?""  She replied ""oh, if you only knew..."" and laughed.  It might have been a joke, but it didn't sound like it, and this was all happening on my birthday of all things.  Now, I believe this is where things branched off for us - instead of ignoring the weird statements and the dishonesty, I would initially become upset, and then I would deflect with humor.  For example, if we'd see a random guy in the street with a bunch of tattoos, I'd say ""hey, look over there...nice, right?""  Stupid, I know, but I was trying not to take things personally and turn it into a joke.

I got along with her parents well - they were Jewish, but I had been told by my girlfriend that me not being Jewish (I'm Indian) was not an issue at all.  As she was an only child, she was a very much too attached to them, but I could live with that.  I come from a family with four siblings, so joking around and teasing each other came with the territory, but I don't think she was as familiar with it.  The only red flag at this stage was when she told her dad that she wanted for us to get married, he said, ""oh, good...that's great. You're betraying the family, but as long as you are happy, I'm happy.""  Definitely a weird thing to say, but my girlfriend reassured me that what he was saying was lost in translation (as her father was Russian)...so, again, I let it go.  

[My](http://me.My) residency program was 6 years long, so at the beginning of my last year, we decide if we would like to pursue a fellowship.  After discussing it and going to multiple cities together for my interviews, we decided that it would be nice to spend a year in Boston, where I was being offered a position in a robotics fellowship.  We had been dating for almost 3 yrs, but were not yet engaged.  She was sure that she wanted to come with me for the move - and, as our parents were relatively traditional in this sense, I had a discussion with her parents that I had every intention of proposing to her and that we were not ""casually dating.""

We move to Boston together and enjoy the new adventure.  Again, I am sometimes busy with my job, but we make it work.  I propose during our year in Boston, while on vacation in Italy.  Overall, the experience was great and we almost stayed in Boston permanently.  However, my fiancee had always wanted to go back to Philly and be near her parents, so I search for a job in the area and find one that is 30 min. outside the city.  

We move to the Philly suburbs and settle down.  We live a very comfortable life and are enjoying things.  We plan our wedding and get married (about 5 yrs into dating).  We are happy 95% of the time...the only thing we don't get along about was the recurring instances of dishonesty, but things are fine and I keep joking about it, instead of getting angry.  It became clear to me that the joking was irritating her, but I stupidly kept going.

Then, COVID pandemic starts and we are home for long stretches of time.  While I am more of a homebody and didn't mind being in lockdown too much, she was getting stir crazy.  But, of course, in the early days of the pandemic, we listened to the authorities and made the best of it.  We start looking at houses to buy and, after some restrictions start to lift, we go to several open houses.  We decide to start trying to have a baby and she begins tracking her ovulation on an app and taking prenatal vitamins.  I am excited to be starting this new phase of my life.  (Of note, she once said that ""I hope the baby doesn't come out too dark because I don't want people thinking I'm their nanny and not their mother.""  At this point, she had said so many weird things, that this was just added to the pile.)  Throughout the relationship, we both made an effort, but I genuinely feel that I was always the ""fixer.""  If we didn't have anything to do...fix it.  If we needed to plan a vacation...fix it.  If she was having issues with her job...fix it.  You're upset about me telling little lies throughout our relationship...fix it somehow.

It is August of 2020 and over the next few weeks, she begins acting strangely - distant, quiet.  We had started playing tennis together and she didn't want to go anymore.  I knew she was upset about something, and sensed something was very wrong, so I was super attentive/caring, to show her how much she meant to me.  My birthday comes around.  We go out to dinner and, during the meal, I make some of those stupid jokes.  She rolled her eyes and the night went on.  We get home and she goes straight to bed...weird, but I want to give her space, if that's what she wants.

I continue to suspect something is going on...I find a letter from our bank that she has opened a new account.  I confront her about it and she says, ""it's no big deal...I just wanted to have some savings.""  Later that week, I call her mother and ask for her help, ""can you please tell me what's happening...I am afraid she is going to leave...she opened this secret bank account, etc.""  She replied, ""don't worry, she is not going to take your money...she really loved you.""  I feel my life slipping away while talking on the phone with her mom, but I keep trying to show my wife how much I care.  I even went so far as to count her prenatal vitamins and saw that she was still taking them - obviously a good sign, right?

I come home that Friday with a preserved bouquet of flowers (the kind that last about 1 year) and a heartfelt written message.  She looks at this and says, ""I can't do this...I can't do this,"" and leaves the apartment to ""go for a drive.""  I was not expecting that response, but I give her space and decide to stay home and pay some bills.  As I'm looking through my banking app, I see that $50,000 was just withdrawn from the account.  I'm puzzled and decide to call my wife.  ""Did you take money out of the bank account?""  After a pause, she said, ""my lawyer said I could.""  I said, ""you're what?!""  And she responded, ""I have filed for divorce.""

To say that I was devastated would be an understatement...I was absolutely crushed.  If I could have died in that moment, I would have done so.  I know that we had our little quibbles, and stupid arguments about nothing, but none of it was so serious as to jump straight to divorce.  She tells me that she coming back home soon and we'll talk.  She shows up a few hours later...with her parents who had driven down.  The parents proceed to tell me that ""these things happen,"" ""it's okay, you'll be fine,"" and her father even said ""don't be a wuss, be a man"" - again, Russian guy who is not very socially aware.  All this time, my wife is sitting silent.  They have a list of grievances against me: you don't buy her new dresses when she has an upcoming wedding to go to...you don't take her car into the shop when it's due for service...you never have sex with her (WTF?)...you are never home and she is all alone in this ""golden prison,""...""don't worry - she's not with someone else""...and that ""we aren't scam artists...the lawyer said that this can all be over in a few months."" - what?!?  And, of course, ""you kept making jokes at her expense""...sigh.

After being together for 8 years (it doesn't sound long, but we were extremely close and spent every free moment together), she and her parents moved her completely out the next morning.  In less than 24 hrs, my whole life's trajectory had changed and I was inconsolable.  For the next few weeks, she refused to speak with me at all.  If I was able to get ahold of her to try and talk, she was downright cruel - saying strangely racist things about how ""Indians are cheap"" (even though I spent tens of thousands of dollars on her when I was a relatively strapped-for-cash resident/fellow), ""even brown people tell white lies,"" and ""not all of us can live off our dead husband's insurance money."" (For context, my father passed away in 2010, so she was referring to my mother, who was her biggest supporter and doted on her constantly, so for her to say this was unnecessarily rude/cruel.)  She even said at one point, ""who knows if you can even have kids, haha,"" knowing that I may have had an issue with fertility that was discovered near the end of our relationship.  I was taken aback - this was not the person I had fallen in love with.  And I was continually being very nice, so it didn't need to get nasty.  About 1 month later, she agrees to meet me for coffee and to sign some paperwork.  During the meeting, she is cold and not acting like herself.  She says ""I don't want to give you false hope.""  I keep trying to reason with her to get counseling...to give us a chance, and I swore to stop the childish joking around about the past, but she was not interested at all.  I asked her if there was someone else in the picture, and she said ""haha, nobody is dating during Covid..."" which I found so strange to say to your husband a few weeks after you've moved out.  She briefly agrees to stay friends at the time, but then later takes it back and says she never wants to see me again.

Here I am, nearly 40 years old, thinking my wife and I were about to start a family and buy our dream home.  And a few weeks later, I am abandoned, shocked, and grief-stricken.  The sadness is consuming - I stayed in our apartment until the lease ran out, so everything was a reminder of us.  Our wedding photos remained on the wall, our albums left behind, and she left some of her clothes behind that she no longer wanted - she left and acted like she was moving out of a dorm.  She kept the big-ticket items like some appliances and her engagement/wedding rings.  I wasn't the perfect husband - but I was suddenly abandoned and traumatized.

I was lost - I had to keep going for work and be cordial, but I was just floating through life.  We lived 5 minutes from each other, but she wanted no contact whatsoever.  In fact, I saw her at a shopping center once and she ran away from me like I was some sort of attacker.  I spend the next few months composing myself and trying to pick up the pieces.  After a while, I start going on the dating apps to see if I can find someone new.  But the problem was that they would ask about why I got divorced, I would tell them the story, and everyone was in disbelief...:there must have been something else?""  The few relationships that had the potential to get serious, I warned them that I was completely fucked up by the events of my divorce and that they were better off without me, so I sabotaged them.

She began playing games with her social media...slowly deleting my relatives from her friends list, then a few months later my direct family, and almost 1 year later I was also deleted.  She went back to old posts that were on my and my siblings Facebook walls, and 'unliked' posts that she had previously liked over the past decade - going the extra mile to erase me.  During that time, trying to get insight into what happened, I would see her Instagram stories - most of them were cryptic messages like ""Movie night! :)"" or ""Cheers to better years,"" on New Year's eve, or vacation pics in Mexico.  Over that year, as difficult as it was, I tried my best to move on and work on myself.  I began working out and lost a good amount of weight (both through exercise and depression).  I began seeing a therapist - who also could not believe the story I was telling, but was supportive.  I started going out with friends, forcing myself to be social, and keeping busy at work - but most of it was a facade...I was still deeply hurting inside.  I got a couple of dogs, who are great, and have kept myself somewhat distracted, trying to build a new life for myself.  Over the next few years, I was able to move on and not contact her at all.  I began buying myself nice things and trying to make the best of my new life.  

But then...I was diagnosed with a somewhat aggressive thyroid cancer at age 41.  I underwent the surgery and radiation treatments over the next few months...my family came to visit when they could, but I was basically alone.  In a moment of weakness, I messaged my ex-wife, informing her about the cancer diagnosis....telling her how sorry I was for the insensitive comments and stupid joking around in the past that made her hate me...how much she truly meant to me...how she was truly the love of my life.  About a day later, I get a short response that says ""Oh, I'm sorry - that's not great news. I don't hate you. Wishing you recovery.""  It was a civil response, but rather short after not speaking for a few years and hearing your ex-husband has aggressive cancer.  I tried to use this statement as further closure that she no longer cared about me like she once did.

A few months later, one of my patients in the office is telling me about how he is getting physical therapy - he mentions the therapist's name and, of course, it was my ex-wife.  I shouldn't have said anything, but I was so surprised that I said, ""oh, you know, she's my ex-wife.""  He responded, ""oh, she's very attractive...did you know that she is engaged?  I think she said that...or maybe she was talking about her boyfriend""  The next few days were tough - I knew this day would come, but that wasn't how I imagined finding out, and kept thinking in the back of my head that someday she would reach out...if for nothing else, but to be friends.  I even had a fantasy that she would show up on the anniversary of her leaving and tell me that it was all part of some reality show and that we won $1 million for staying apart for a certain period of time.  Every special occasion, or birthday, I waited all day to receive a text from her, but nothing came.  Months go by...

Fast-forward to this past weekend.  I'm watching TV and casually scrolling through Instagram when I see a ""friend suggestion"" and the profile picture is my ex-wife, some other guy holding her, and an engagement ring.  My heart sank.  After a little basic investigation, I see that she is engaged to a UROLOGIST that works in my old department - when I had worked there, he was a medical student.  During the time I was with my wife, he completed his residency, and had moved back to the area in 2019.  I'm shocked - why did none of my colleagues at my old job tell me that this was happening?  I had a friend who I had been in residency with, who had gone to our wedding, who I had told the story of how devastated I was from this experience, and who still worked in our department - I called him the next day and asked, ""weird question, when's the last time you saw my ex-wife?""  After a pause, he said ""oh, she was at the Urology resident graduation at the chairman's house 2 yrs ago - she came with a new Urologist who was looking to join the department.""  I said, ""why didn't you tell me?""  He said, ""I thought you would have known...I thought it was a little weird seeing your wife at the party with some guy.  I told some people at the party and they were surprised, too.""  At the party, she was supposedly introduced to my friend by her boyfriend and she acted like they didn't already know each other...also so incredibly weird.  All of the complaints she had of me not being around and working all the time - and she gets engaged to another Urologist who works at my old department?!  He tells me ""I think they're living together, or getting an apartment in the city...""  Great friend, right?

She basically replaced me with a younger (2 yrs younger than herself) Jewish guy.  I feel so devastatingly hurt by the new developments.  I don't feel like this is real life - it's got to be a movie, or some kind of simulation.  The guy she dated before me was a bartender...and urologists are not super common that you would marry two in a row.  I simply cannot process what the hell is happening.  I just want the pain to be over - by any means.  I break down in tears throughout the day...my heart pounding and I can't catch my breath.  I know I shouldn't, but I still miss her.  I should move on, but I feel tortured by my mind and the ways she has chosen to move forward.  If she didn't want to be together, we could have divorced in a less traumatic, peaceful manner...without the sneak attack, stealing money, insults (which, by the way, were all coming from her - I stayed very nice throughout the process because I wanted to save what we had), resentment, etc.

On an intellectual/logical level, I know that I'm better off - without the lies, without the racism, without the gold-digging, without the unreasonable criticism from her mother, without kids in the picture, without the constant need for me to keep her entertained, without me having to fix things all the time - but I am absolutely crushed.  I am literally tearing up while writing this post because I  can't believe this has all happened over the past decade.  And I am upset with myself for not being able to get over it - I'm a 42-year-old super-friendly decent-looking surgeon, so I should be having the time of my life right now.  But these past few years have been the darkest that I have ever experienced...",1,1734493819.0,Divorce,0,1.0,False
1hgt1mu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualPH/comments/1hgt1mu/the_mixed_feelings_of_excitement_and_anxiety_for/,The mixed feelings of excitement and anxiety for job interviews when job hunting.,"Ganito rin siguro nararamdaman ng iba rito kapag naghahanap ng work, then all of a sudden after checking text messages and/or email may notif informing you of an interview invite. That sudden jolt of excitement and anxiety. Especially if short notice like kinabukasan ang schedule.

Excited dahil out of probably a bunch of applications ay yun ang isa sa nag-consider sayo. But there's the slight anxiety with the idea of facing a job interview, knowing you have to give your best shot na maging maayos ang pagsagot sa mga tanong pati pagtanong, while showing good conduct and desirable behavior tsaka composure and confidence.

So you prep your interview wear na maayos and if may prescribed attire, then a copy of resume and valid IDs and maybe whatever other requirements/documents in case needed. And arriving a bit early like 15-30 mins before to settle down at kumalma ng onti, sabayan na rin ng pagdasal. Better if may madaanang simbahan na open before or after interview to pray. And once na-meet na ung interviewer ito na ung feeling na ""this is it"" then try to focus, trying to keep composure and confidence up while still trying to be natural.

Once natapos na ung meeting, medj kalmado na, pero there's still the longing anxiety and excitement pa rin, this time sa results ng interview tsaka decision whether you made it or not sa susunod na part ng recruitment process. You passed, andun ung excitement to finally start once settled na lahat; if not, may kaunting bigat sa puso o lungkot, yet you'll move on and continue job searching; if wala pa after like days or weeks mag-follow-up then wait, if wala pa rin then you eventually accept na wala na.

Ayun, nagtatry pa rin ako mag-job hunt. Over a month since nawala sa dating work bilang dessert store crew. Got invited to a preliminary interview for a sales associate sa isang Ortigas based IT company after applying supposedly for an admin role for a coffee shop company based in Taytay, pero di nakapasa. Then the next day which is now, kakapasa lang ng email nakatanggap agad ng text inviting me to an interview for a sales account executive sa isang residence hotel sa Ortigas. Got that mixed emotions of excitement and anxiety, napaisip muna onti if should I go for it na, then eventually confirmed to push through with the interview tomorrow. Who knows baka ito na ung opportunity na nag-aantay sa akin, why not give it a shot diba? Prefer ko rin naman hotels as part of the hospitality field since yun din tinapos ko nung college, then at least 2 years food and beverages experience, while open to explore other aspects ng industry or even other fields I may be interested in.

Ganito rin ba feeling niyo pag may invite sa interviews? Excited for a potential opportunity, pero may halong kaba on how to get through the meeting, tsaka pangamba with those what ifs or 50-50s whether para sa iyo ba ang opportunity or not?

Good luck sa kin, hopefully matanggap. Maybe goods na pamasko sa sarili kung sakali. 🙏",1,1734493762.0,CasualPH,0,1.0,False

I’ve been spending exactly two afternoons in Brooklyn parks and coffee shops, and I’ve cracked the code: I can now tell if you’re a newly-arrived migrant or just an NYC transplant trying to pass as interesting.

Here’s the thing. There’s a distinct vibe. Migrants have an actual destination—they walk with purpose. You, however, just wandered into Greenpoint because a blog told you about a “hidden gem” bagel shop. Migrants wear practical shoes—boots that could survive a warzone. You’re wearing $400 leather loafers that scream “I just moved here from a WeWork.” Migrants are out here surviving. You’re out here looking for “community.”

Yesterday, I overheard some guys from Venezuela cracking jokes while absolutely destroying a game of soccer. Meanwhile, Chad from Portland is on the sidelines in his Patagonia vest, debating whether he’s emotionally ready to commit to indoor climbing season.

It’s all love—this is New York, after all. Everyone’s a migrant here, whether it’s from Queens to Brooklyn, Ohio to Bushwick, or Guatemala to Sunset Park. I’m just saying, you can feel who’s here because they need to be and who’s here because a vibe told them to come.

Anyway, shout out to the real migrants, y’all are hustling out here. The rest of us are just trying to figure out how to survive the brunch lines.",14,1734493705.0,circlejerknyc,2,1.0,False

1hgswwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoreLink/comments/1hgswwx/goobers_updated_lore/,Goobers updated lore,"Backstory of Goober
Character:
Goober is a 28-year-old Canadian pilot in the Royal Canadian Air Force, standing at a compact 5’4”. He’s often described as a femboy, embodying the quintessential spirit of Canada, framing a face marked with a mischievous grin. Goober’s personality is a kaleidoscope of silliness, curiosity, and a hint of recklessness that endears him to both friends and fellow airmen. His love for all things Canadian is evident in his diet, often seen indulging in poutines or sipping coffee from a Tim Hortons cup while engaged in animated conversations with his fighter jet, whom he affectionately names Maple.
Motivation and Goals:
At his core, Goober is driven by his desire for adventure and the joy of flight. He craves the excitement of being in the air, feeling free and untethered by the mundane realities of life. However, beneath his cheerful demeanor lies a darker ambition: he aims to prove his worth as a pilot—not just to his fellow airmen but also to himself. He seeks recognition, believing that greatness in the skies will erase the mistakes hidden under his playful facade. The Canadian anthem, which emanates fiercely in his presence, serves as both a source of pride and an ironic reminder of the internal conflict he faces—a sharp contrast between the joyful image he projects and the dark truths he conceals.
Significant Events:
Goober's journey into the military was not without its challenges. Growing up in a small Canadian town, his adventurous spirit often landed him in trouble, which led him to enlist in the Air Force as a means to channel his energy positively. A fateful moment came during a routine training mission when he survived a near-fatal crash, , an incident that most likely effected his brain, causing his bond with Maple. From that day onward, Goober believed that Maple had a soul of its own, and he vowed to protect his ""pet"" with all his might.
However, amid the air patrols and training exercises, he became entwined in a series of classified missions that spiraled out of control. Under immense pressure to succeed and prove himself, Goober committed several acts that would be classified as war crimes. While he justified these actions with a sense of duty, he buried the guilt deep within, allowing his silly persona to mask the weight of his choices.
Relationships:
Goober’s charm draws people in, leading to friendships that linger and blossom through laughter and shared experiences. In the military, he earns the affectionate nickname ""Canada’s Sweetheart,"" with fellow airmen both amused and bewildered by his whimsical nature. His relationship with Maple, which sounds eccentric to outsiders, is an unshakeable bond; he converses with the jet as if it were his lover, seeing it as his only true companion.
Growth and Change:
Throughout his journey, Goober grapples with the weight of his choices. While he initially embraces his silly persona as a shield against guilt, the realization that his actions have consequences begins to seep in. Driven by his internal conflict, he starts to reflect on the meaning of courage—not just in the air, but in facing his mistakes. As the story unfolds, Goober must confront his past and decide whether to continue the reckless path he has carved or seek redemption for the shadows he has cast.
In a climactic moment, Goober faces a critical decision during a mission that could either lead to glory or destruction. It is here that the anthem will play loudest, echoing the call for unity and responsibility, forcing him to confront who he truly is behind the facade of silliness. he chooses the path of self-preservation, suppressing the weight of his actions, and hides them away from the public",1,1734493322.0,LoreLink,0,1.0,False

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year and have been long distance for over 2 months now..I am withdrawing from my antidepressant medication because I’m tapering off of them for health reasons, and can’t tell if I’m making issues where there shouldn’t be any because my emotions are at an all time high . My bf is very busy getting his licensing to become a pilot, and the plan is to go to Europe where he is and live together for a year until we can come back to Canada where I am now. He only flies  every other week but has been studying for some written tests. He never really says sweet affectionate things to me and it’s really getting on my nerves. I am really low right now and I need the support and kindness from him. He doesn’t really send me anything either although I asked for a coffee gift card so I could think of him while I go get coffee. The idea is to move in March and get a place together but I want our relationship to stay strong in the meantime. 

He never really empathizes with me. He’ll say things like oh I know you’re lonely and bored it must be hard..but he never tells me he misses me or can’t wait to be with me again..maybe a few times when I first left. He never really sends me thoughtful messages..never goes out of his way to suprise me. He’s very good with making plans and travelling and finding cute spots to eat, but he is really bad at the verbal affirmations. Even in person he doesn’t really cuddle or hold me, stroke my hair. If I lay down on him he wouldn’t touch me affectionately he would be on his phone. 

He’s always in a slightly negative mood, always analytical. He like hugs and holding hands some times but then come off very forced and awkward. He never once asked me if I got home okay from anything even when we were in the same country. 

I just don’t know if this man can meet my needs with affection and attentiveness..and it breaks my heart because he is a supportive person and wants me to find my purpose and follow my dreams and that’s very important to me in a partner. 
He is the type of person who genuinely wants the best for me and he does pay attention and shows me he cares in many other ways. He always takes care of me when I’m sick and plans little surprise trips for us. Please let me know if I’m being crazy. 

TL;DR:
I am suffering with the long distance and really need more verbal affirmations from my less than affectionate bf",1,1734493265.0,relationships,0,1.0,False
1hgsvsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hgsvsb/aita_for_calling_the_furniture_my_boyfriend_chose/,"AITA for calling the furniture my boyfriend chose, ugly?","So, my boyfriend and I are about to live together. I am moving to another country to be with him and I value immensely how our home/ apartment is going to look because it’s important to me that it feels safe and comfortable for the both of us. 

I also understand that it’s important to him that we purchase things that are affordable as he has some insecurities around how much money he makes and what he can afford. 
I am privileged to have a job that can help us live a more comfortable life.

Now, when it comes to the vision of our apartment and whether we have compatible tastes, well we do. We have shared pictures, Pinterest boards and ideas, we have a very similar vision.- we are still long distance and are moving in together next week so everything has had to be through these mediums. 

I suggested we start to furnish the apartment little by little and spend money as we go and not all at once. Of course, invest in the essentials. 
I was going to order some curtains for the bedroom and I asked him if he liked them and had him choose the color he liked most and even though it was not my favorite, I agreed because I still like the color and I want his input.
As we were discussing whether we should get a desk, he made a comment about whether I was going to ask for his opinion before getting a desk or if I was just going to buy one.
I told him that I would ask him what he likes and we can choose together.
Well after this conversation, he sends me images of furniture that I did not like at all.
It was a couch, a coffee table and a rug. He asked me what I thought and he said his co worker was selling the furniture for very cheap. 

I told him not to buy it, that I don’t like it and it’s not something I want in our home. He then proceeds to tell me that he already told his co-worker he was going to buy it from him and that he was very grateful we could find furniture for such a cheap price and that his co-worker was doing us a favor. 

I honestly got a little upset that he made that decision without asking me first, to which I replied “it’s ugly and it’s tacky.”

He then took that as if I was insulting what he could afford and that I should just buy everything on my own. I tried to find a compromise and I said, ok, we can make the couch work and I can compromise that. He said he doesn’t want me to settle for ugly funeral just to compromise.

I tried to make things better and tell him that I didn’t appreciate that he made decision without asking me first, I told him that it’s not ugly because it’s inexpensive furniture, it’s just not something I would feel good having in our home. He just kept saying that I should just pick the furniture now and that he’s not going to suggest anything anymore. He was alluding that I am trying to control how our home looks and that only my opinion matters.

1hgskij,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnneagramTypeMe/comments/1hgskij/can_you_type_me/,Can you type me?,"Hello again!



I know I've been posting semi-frequently, but I'm just invested in finding my type.

I decided to take another approach to help with identifying my type, as I found some tests or questions were generally long-winded. I’ve taken a long, hard look at myself over the past few months to recognize my strengths, weaknesses, etc. 

I do realize that my internal perception and external opinions can be very different. I know it comes down to your core motivation as well, however I have a hard time discerning what's a true, honest, impactful fear for me. If I had to describe it, it would be wasting my life, my potential and never truly living my life- it's part of my motivation to find my type, so I can find what's stopping me!

Ever since I was young, before much trauma, my mom told me I was very creative, kind and welcoming. I was very curious about things and was fearless in pointing things out or asking questions. As I grew, I felt myself dealing with a lot of abuse and trauma which had severely impacted and limited my sense of growth as a person. In order to be myself or to express myself I had to explain the reason behind everything, it could never just be “fun”. 

As a result I developed a poor sense of self-discipline because I wanted to allow myself fun I didn’t often have. I had visited a few child psychologists in order to find what was wrong, when it was just anxiety from my home life. When I was at school, I would slack off and allow myself that time of fun I wasn’t allowed at home. Getting older and older, I was told I was mature and calm. However I felt like I was stifling myself and there were a rare few times I would show my potential, such as performing at the talent show. 

One thing that has always been a recurring theme was wishing I lived in the Zelda or D&D universe, sharing adventures and making some history or making a genuine difference. Not that it can't happen in reality, however it would be cool to discover some ruins or beautiful places untouched by civilization.

Here’s what I am when I'm stressed/at my worst;

I can feel as though many people are jaded or selfish and reflect it, often feeling as though I don’t have the energy to be the light in the dark and I can tend to overthink.  It’s never happened but my worst fear is giving up and not persevering as it's what I've always done. I go between distracting myself with my friends and partying and drinking, to also dreading hanging out with my friends. I get upset with how the world works, how cruel it could be. I try to push my partner towards finding someone who is more positive and could make their life happier because I can’t give them it at the moment. I can get really snappy, take criticism harshly and focus on pacifying myself- whether it is spending unnecessary money, running unnecessary errands, etc to avoid being home and reflecting. I tend to drink a lot more coffee and caffeine.

 I feel the need to make myself some plans to recover or get better, yet don’t have the energy to follow through with them. I can forget to stay in contact with family and loved ones despite wanting too. I tend to limit myself, thinking I'm not ready when I know all that I need is within myself.

At my best;

I am much more enthusiastic, willing to and wanting to try new things. I have a newfound zest for life, a sense of silliness and wonderment, the same I had as a kid. I feel much more creative. I'm more careful with my money and take better care of myself, feeling motivated to invest in a healthier lifestyle. I allow myself to “play” again and don’t feel as though I always have to be doing something productive to be doing something good. I tend to have more time to invest towards my loved ones and friends and appreciate them more, wishing I could treat them more. I am interested in interacting and engaging with coworkers and strangers, craving that minute of genuine conversation and widening my perspective. I crave experience and to be alive.

It wasn't until now as an adult I’ve been given enough space to reclaim who I was at my core, a curious, silly and positive person. It’s taken a lot of work and self-reflection which was hard to sit down and to do in the first place. Thoughts?

Moved on from concrete to demo recently. The last company was decent. What drove me to leave was the owner's non specific criticism that could be easily summed up by ""I'm told I'm not getting my money's worth out of you."" As well as his criticism of my drinking of coffee on site. Chalked it up to a difference in culture. Definitely seems like construction is filled with people whose identity's are built upon their jobs, being away from their families, and working themselves into an early grave. Not my thing, so i left.

Fast forward to today. I'm disassembling some chunks of ceiling like I was told to and the owner is quietly watching over my shoulder. When I'm done he comes up to me and asks, ""why did that take you so long?"" I tell him I'm just doing it the way I was told. I had used a drill to take apart some screws where my 16 oz hammer just wasn't cutting it. He points that out and said, ""that's not how I showed \*insert name\*. These pieces should only take a few minutes. I need you to pick up the pace."" Ok. No biggie. I had pointed out when I was shown how to do it that it felt like overkill. But now I'm being talked down to by the owner for exactly that point. But lets forget that I was doing it exactly that way all yesterday, all while keeping up with my co workers. But if he wants me to do it less thoroughly, he's the boss.

Idk why though, but it just rubbed me the wrong way. Maybe I'm still working through how my last job dished out criticism. I just feel like I'm working just as hard as everyone else. I have no desire to go full throttle first thing in the morning. And even if I were to; why? I'm a fucking hourly employee. My union offers nothing in the sense of job protection. I mean, bosses could fire me for literally any reason they want to. And so for my employer to ask me to up my pace, I'm just confused as to what's my motivation to do so? I work hard. I don't have day care, so sometimes I have to leave early. Otherwise I work the 10's they ask me to, and the Saturdays. I get he's on a deadline but I'm always questioning why that's my issue?

For all those who might label me as not a team player, you're probably right. But this is a job. They could fire me and replace me by the end of the week. I could get injured and they'd replace me. I could fucking die and they'd replace me. And once this job and the other job's are done, I'm laid off. As an hourly employee, it's my priority to work hard enough to keep the job going at a good pace but not hard enough to where I'm dead by the end of the day and I'm out of a job. So I don't really get what he expects, or any employer for that matter, when they say things like this or give criticisms in such a way. If you wanna tell me how I could be faster, sure. Lets do that. I want to learn how to go from good to great. But if you point out I'm just being slower than your expectation. I guess I am. It's my job to do the work that earns you profit and me a paycheck. It's your job to figure out how to motivate me to do more.

Avalon woke up with a flutter of excitement in her chest. Thirteen. She was officially a teenager. It wasn't like she expected a parade or anything, but birthdays were special, and maybe this year would finally feel like her day. Sure, it was a school day, but that didn't matter. She had already picked out her best outfit the night before: a soft pink sweater and jeans. After cleaning herself up, Avalon hurriedly got dressed, taking the time to brush her hair before grabbing her scrunchie and throwing it into a ponytail. She smiled at her reflection, feeling like she looked older somehow.

 Rushing downstairs, her expectations were high. Her mother was always busy Avalon had learned not to expect too much. But today was her birthday. Her birthday. Surely her mom would do something special to mark the occasion. Her mom was in the kitchen, phone pressed between her ear and shoulder as she rifled through some papers on the counter. A cup of coffee steamed nearby, untouched. Avalon lingered at the foot of the stairs, waiting for her mom to notice her. When she didn't,  Avalon cleared her throat. Her mom looked up, startled, before her expression softened into a hurried smile. ""Oh, happy birthday, sweetie!"" she said, still distracted. She quickly kissed Avalon on the forehead, the scent of her floral perfume lingering in the air. ""I have a meeting in twenty minutes, so I need you out the door."" 

Before Avalon could say a word, her mom pressed a blueberry muffin into her hand, still warm but hastily wrapped in a napkin. ""Breakfast to go, okay? Make sure you eat it before class. I'll see you tonight!"" That was it. Avalon's shoulders slumped as she was ushered out of the house, her mom' s voice already fading behind her as she moved ahead to enter the car. She stared down at the muffin. It wasn’t even chocolate chip.

 The drive to school felt longer than usual. Her excitement from earlier had fizzled into a dull ache, but she told herself not to care. She had friends, right? Surely they'd remember her birthday. The day dragged on, and by lunchtime, it became clear that most of her classmates didn't know or didn't care. Avalon picked at her cafeteria pizza, her earlier excitement fading into something dull and hollow. Then, as she sat at a corner table, she heard a voice.

""Hey, birthday girl""  Harper said, sliding into the seat across from her. Avalon blinked, surprised. Even though Harper wasn't exactly her best friend - more like a neighbor she'd always had a complicated relationship with, Harper remembered. ""Uh, happy birthday"" Harper added, pulling a crumpled piece of notebook paper from her backpack and sliding it over. ""I didn't have much time, but I made you this."" Avalon unfolded the paper to find a doodle of the two of them as stick figures. It was goofy, not perfect like Harper usually was, but it made Avalon smile.

""Thanks"" she said, her voice softer. Before she could say more, another voice cut in. ""Sup, birthday girl?"" Nicky, a freckled blonde boy, plopped down at the table, his tray clattering. He was one of those kids who always looked like he'd just rolled out of bed - messy hair, smudged clothes, and a gruff attitude to match. ""You're thirteen now, huh?"" he added with a smirk. ""Guess that makes you officially old. You want this?"" He shoved a half-eaten cupcake in her direction. Avalon wrinkled her nose. ""No thanks."" 

Nicky shrugged and stuffed it in his mouth anyway. ""Your loss."" 

Despite herself, Avalon felt her mood lift a little. Harper's doodle and Nicky's... well, Nicky-ness weren't much, but it was more than she'd gotten from anyone else. The rest of the day dragged on, and by the time she got home, her excitement had turned into exhaustion. She opened the front door, expecting to find the house quiet, her mom still working late. Instead, she was greeted by the smell of something sweet, though not quite baked yet. She blinked in confusion, then froze when she heard her mom's voice.""Happy birthday, Avalon!"" Her mom stood in the kitchen, apron tied over her work blouse. Bowls, measuring cups, and a few ingredients were spread out on the counter. Her smile looked hopeful but slightly strained, like she was bracing for Avalon to brush her off. ""I managed to get out of work early today."" her mom explained, smoothing her hands down the front of her apron. ""I thought we could bake a cake together. You know, for your birthday."" 

Avalon stared, her backpack sliding off her shoulder and thudding to the floor. A part of her wanted to be excited, this was exactly the kind of thing she used to dream about when she was little. But now? Now it felt like another one of her moms last-minute attempts to fix things, to make up for being too busy or distracted earlier. She hesitated. ""You already have stuff out."" 

Her moms smile faltered for a moment, but she recovered quickly. ""I wanted to make it special. Come on, it'll be fun. I got everything you like chocolate frosting, sprinkles, the works."" Avalon wanted to say no, wanted to retreat upstairs and sulk in her room, but she didn't have the energy to argue. ""Okay"" she said softly, shrugging as she stepped into the kitchen. 

They worked together in silence at first. Avalon sifted flour and cracked eggs while her mom measured out sugar and cocoa powder. Every so often, her mom would try to make conversation, asking about Avalon's day or cracking a light joke about how messy the kitchen was becoming. Avalon answered politely, but her mind kept circling back to the morning. Why couldn't her mom have done this earlier? Or maybe remembered her favorite muffin instead of grabbing the first thing she saw? She felt guilty for thinking it, but she couldn't help it. At first, it was fine. Then her mom started... interfering.

""Here, let me help"", her mom said, reaching over to adjust the way Avalon was holding the whisk.

""I got it"" Avalon muttered, tightening her grip.

Her mom didn't seem to hear her. ""You need to mix it faster, sweetie. Like this."" She took the bowl from Avalon and demonstrated, the whisk clinking against the sides. 

Avalon crossed her arms, biting back the urge to snap. She knew how to whisk, but her mom always acted like she had to fix everything Avalon did. When it was time to pour the batter into the pan, Avalon grabbed the bowl, determined to do it herself. She carefully tilted it, watching the thick batter slide out, only for her mom to swoop in and help guide the bowl. ""Careful, you're going to spill"" her mom said.

""I wasn't gonna spill it!"" Avalon snapped, her frustration finally bubbling over. Her mom blinked, taken aback. ""I was just trying to help"", she said softly. Avalon sighed, guilt mixing with her irritation. ""I know. I just... I can do it okay."" Her mom nodded, stepping back, but the tension lingered.

Her mom didn't push further, but Avalon could feel her watching, her concern hanging in the air like an invisible weight. They finished the cake together, and Avalon had to admit it looked good once it came out of the oven. But even as her mom sang Happy Birthday and they shared a slice, the knot in Avalon's chest didn't completely go away. Sometimes, it felt like everything her mom did was just trying to patch things up after messing them up in the first place. It wasn't enough to ruin the day entirely, but it was enough to make Avalon feel like she’d been holding her breath all day, waiting for something magical that never really came. 

When she finally went upstairs that night, Avalon curled up under her blanket and stared at the glow-in-the-dark stars on her ceiling. It wasn't the worst birthday she'd ever had, but it wasn't the best either. And for some reason, that made it feel even worse.",3,1734491440.0,CampHalfBloodRP,0,1.0,False

Dealing with bad breath (halitosis) can be a real confidence killer. Now, throw dentures into the mix, and things can get even trickier. Dentures, while a fantastic solution for missing teeth, can unfortunately become a breeding ground for odor-causing bacteria if not cared for properly. This article dives deep into the often-embarrassing topic of bad breath and dentures, exploring the causes, offering practical solutions, and ultimately empowering you to regain your fresh breath confidence. We'll cover everything from denture hygiene to lifestyle adjustments, tackling those pesky bacteria head-on. So, if you're ready to say goodbye to denture breath, let's get started!

Bad Breath and Dentures: Understanding the Connection
-----------------------------------------------------

Let's face it, no one wants to be *that* person with the noticeable breath. And when you wear dentures, managing breath freshness can sometimes feel like an uphill battle. But understanding the connection between bad breath and dentures is the first step to conquering this challenge. Essentially, dentures, like natural teeth, can accumulate food particles and plaque, creating a perfect environment for bacteria to thrive. These bacteria release volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), the culprits behind that unpleasant odor. Think of your dentures as a cozy little apartment complex for bacteria – if you don't keep things clean, the residents will definitely start to make their presence known!

### The Usual Suspects: Common Causes of Denture Breath

Why do dentures sometimes lead to bad breath? There are several factors at play:

1. **Poor Denture Hygiene:** This is the most common culprit. Just like natural teeth, dentures require daily cleaning. Insufficient brushing, soaking, or rinsing allows food particles and plaque to accumulate, fueling bacterial growth and, consequently, bad breath.
2. **Ill-Fitting Dentures:** Dentures that don't fit snugly can create tiny spaces between the denture and your gums. These spaces become traps for food debris and bacteria, leading to unpleasant odors and potentially even gum irritation. Imagine crumbs getting stuck in the folds of a tablecloth – not exactly a recipe for freshness.
3. **Dry Mouth (Xerostomia):** Saliva plays a crucial role in washing away food particles and neutralizing acids in the mouth. A dry mouth, often a side effect of certain medications or medical conditions, reduces saliva production, creating a drier environment where bacteria can flourish. Think of saliva as your mouth's natural cleaning crew – without it, things can get pretty grimy.
4. **Certain Foods and Drinks:** We all know that garlic, onions, and coffee can leave their mark on our breath. These strong-smelling foods can be absorbed into the bloodstream and released through the lungs, contributing to bad breath even with proper denture hygiene.
5. **Smoking:** Smoking dries out the mouth, stains dentures, and generally wreaks havoc on oral health, further exacerbating bad breath.

Bad Breath and Dentures: Taming the Beast
-----------------------------------------

Now that we've identified the potential culprits behind denture breath, let's dive into the solutions. Thankfully, there are several effective ways to combat this issue and regain your fresh breath confidence.

### Denture Care 101: Tips for Sparkling Clean Dentures

- **Brush Your Dentures Daily:** This is non-negotiable! Use a denture brush and a non-abrasive denture cleanser to remove food particles and plaque. Avoid using regular toothpaste, as it can be too abrasive and scratch the denture surface. Think of your dentures as delicate china – you wouldn't scrub them with steel wool!
- **Soak Your Dentures Overnight:** Soaking dentures in a denture cleaning solution helps to disinfect them and remove stubborn stains. Follow the instructions on your chosen denture cleanser carefully. This is like giving your dentures a spa treatment overnight.
- **Rinse Thoroughly:** After brushing and soaking, rinse your dentures thoroughly under running water to remove any remaining cleanser residue. This ensures a fresh, clean feeling when you put them back in.
- **Inspect Your Dentures Regularly:** Look for any cracks, chips, or signs of wear and tear. If you notice anything unusual, contact your denturist promptly.

### Lifestyle Adjustments to Banish Bad Breath

""SECRET of Fresh breath https://freepage.pro/samutores/freshbreath""

Beyond denture care, certain lifestyle changes can also make a world of difference:

1. **Stay Hydrated:** Drinking plenty of water helps to keep your mouth moist, washing away food particles and combating dry mouth. Think of water as your mouth's internal shower.
2. **Eat a Balanced Diet:** A healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables can help to neutralize odors and promote overall oral health. Crunchy fruits and vegetables can also act as natural cleansers, scrubbing away debris.
3. **Limit Odor-Causing Foods:** While you don't have to completely eliminate garlic, onions, and coffee, moderation is key. Be mindful of your breath after consuming these foods and take extra care with your denture hygiene.
4. **Quit Smoking:** This is arguably the best thing you can do for your overall health, including your oral health. Smoking dries out your mouth, stains your dentures, and contributes significantly to bad breath and denture stomatitis.
5. **Regular Dental Checkups:** Even with dentures, regular visits to your dentist and denturist are crucial for maintaining good oral health. They can identify any underlying issues, ensure your dentures fit properly, and provide professional cleaning. Denture adhesives, though helpful, can contribute to bacterial growth if not used correctly. Consulting with your denturist can help you determine the right adhesive and application technique for your needs.

Bad Breath and Dentures: Seeking Professional Help
--------------------------------------------------

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, denture breath persists. If this is the case, don't hesitate to seek professional help. Your dentist or denturist can help identify any underlying issues contributing to the problem.

### When to See a Professional

- **Persistent Bad Breath:** If your bad breath persists despite diligent denture care and lifestyle adjustments, it's time to see a professional.
- **Sore or Irritated Gums:** This could be a sign of ill-fitting dentures or an infection.
- **Changes in the Fit of Your Dentures:** Dentures that suddenly feel loose or uncomfortable may need to be adjusted or relined.

Bad Breath and Dentures: Reclaiming Your Confidence
---------------------------------------------------

Dealing with bad breath from dentures can be a frustrating experience, but it’s definitely not a life sentence! By implementing the strategies outlined in this article, you can effectively combat denture breath, reclaim your confidence, and enjoy fresh breath freedom. Remember, practicing good denture hygiene, making healthy lifestyle choices, and seeking professional help when needed are the keys to a healthier, fresher you.

-----

Let me first start by saying the Departed is one of my favorite movies. I have watched it probably a hundred times, and I know all the dialog back and forth. It does so many things well in tying together weird details to explain all the weaving storylines. Or, at least, if things are not outright explained, it's easy to understand HOW the characters could easily come to the conclusions they did.

*However, one thing that has NEVER made sense logically to me is how William Costigan (Leo DiCaprio) knows that Madolyn is SPECIFICALLY Colin Sullivan's girlfriend.*

What he should know is the following:

- She's dating a guy who has ""problems"" (coffee shop scene, 1hr10m)
- She's in a serious relationship for about 4 months (coffee shop scene)
- She's moving into this guy's apartment (apartment scene, 1hr20m )
- He knows Sullivan is the rat when he finds the Citizen's Trust envelope (2hr10m)
- It's probably reasonable to think he knows Madolyn's boyfriend is a statie of some kind, even though its not discussed outright

---

**But how could he POSSIBLY know that Sullivan, in particular, in Madolyn's boyfriend, when he confronts her at her (his) apartment (2hr11m)?**

**Or does he NOT actually know, and it's just pure luck that Sullivan happens to be her boyfriend?**

**Or does he put two and two together when he sends the tape to Sullivan (2hr13m) and sees his address is the same as the one he knows for Madolyn?**

Without understanding this it's kind of hard for me to make sense of that part of the movie, because otherwise he's essentially sending weird incriminating evidence (the ""Costigan"" envelope, the tape) to a woman who is dating a guy in the staties, who to Costigan may or may not even be involved in anything related to him. It's like saying ""Yes I have evidence the police lieutenant is a rat, so I'm sending it to a random sergeant's wife.""

# Ingredients

# Biscotti

* 2 cups almond flour
* ½ cup granular sweetener
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* ¼ tsp xanthan gum (optional)
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* ¼ cup butter, melted (or avocado oil)
* 1 large egg
* ¾ teaspoon vanilla extract

# Cinnamon ""Sugar""

* 3 tablespoon granular sweetener
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon

# Instructions

* Preheat the oven to 325ºF and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
* In a large bowl, whisk together the almond flour, sweetener, baking powder, cinnamon, xanthan gum, and salt. Stir in the melted butter, egg, and vanilla extract until the dough comes together.
* Turn the dough out onto the prepared baking sheet and form into a low, flat log, about 10 x 4 inches. Bake for 25 minutes or until lightly browned and firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and let cool for 25 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 250ºF.
* With a large serrated knife, gently slice the log into 15 even slices. Place the slices back onto the baking sheet, cut side down, and bake for 15 minutes.
* Flip each slice carefully and continue to bake for another 15 minutes. Turn off the oven and let them sit inside until cool. Keep your eye on them in case they brown too quickly.
* In a shallow dish, whisk together the granulated sweetener and cinnamon. Dip the biscotti on both sides in the cinnamon mixture.

# Notes

**Storage Information:** Biscotti are baked hard and dry, so they have a longer shelf life than things like keto chocolate chip cookies. You can store them in a covered container on the counter for up to a week. You can also freeze biscotti for several months.If you live in a humid environment, they may soften up as they sit. You can crisp them back up by placing them in a warm (200ºF) oven for 15 minutes or so, and letting them cool again.

1hgryk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RenalCats/comments/1hgryk8/rapid_progression_in_my_sweet_old_lady/,Rapid Progression in my Sweet Old Lady,"Hi everyone, 

Vet nurse of 8 years and a semi-veteran senior kitty rescuer here. I brought home this sweet pink nosed lady, Rubby, in March of 2020. Her original mom was an elderly lady who fell and broke her hip, and so she lived at my clinic for a couple months before I finally decided to take her home because we weren't able o give her the attention and love she deserved during the insanity that was working in vet med during COVID. She was 9 years old at the time. She turned 14 a few months ago. 

  
In September, she went in for her vaccines and senior bloodwork. long story short diagnosed early stage 2, we changed to the k/d diet and she mostly only likes the dry but we waste a can of wet on her every day (lol.) She only eats a few bites of it but that's ok. I also give her cosequin and welactin fish oil supplements in churu. I decided to start adequan for her arthritis as well. 

  
I MADE myself wait for 3 months to recheck her bloodwork so as not to be a crazy person. Turns out everything had gotten so bad without me noticing at all. We hospitalized her for 3 days on IV fluids, urinalysis culture negative, and her ultrasound only showed evidence of aging kidneys. :( I was honestly hoping for something infectious since that would be easier to treat. Her recheck bloodwork showed very minimal response to the IVF. 

  
Now she's been home for a little over a week, we are doing daily subQ fluids, added in multiple oral supplements (fish oil, calming care probiotic, cosequin, aminavast, AlOH.) But in my heart I know she's not stabilizing like I had hoped. I compared a photo of her from Nov 23 to today and she looks so much thinner and her coat is separating. My previous kidney kitty was well maintained for over a year on SQF and his diet, eventually it was a combination of kidney disease and an oral mass that finally made his QOL unacceptable. I'm struggling with how fast she has progressed and if there's anything I could have done for her. Photos of my baby girl included.

Thanks for clicking in. I'm Matt, 30, from Idaho.  Dating around my parts feels clumsy, and often times feels like the kind of person I'm looking for isn't in this area, so I thought I'd give online a bit of a try.

A bit about me! 

* I just turned 30 a little bit ago.  It was a terrifying experience at first, but I pretty quickly got over it lol.  It overall encouraged me to target the areas in my life that I'm unhappy with to work towards making change there!
* Physically, I'm blonde haired, green/blue eyes, 5'10 or 5'11"", depending on the doctor (Still chronically short for Tinder), overall a pretty thin individual.  I'd like to get back into working out, as I used to do calisthenics as a way to get into shape and be more active.  I do wear glasses, which isn't portrayed in my pictures, however I'm happy to send you one with me wearing them!
* I currently work a WFH job as an analyst for some pretty large companies across the country, however I'm trying to change into tech/cybersecurity.  It's a bit of a process, but I've been able to make some solid connections to progress in this!
* I'm likely trying to move to the east coast at some point, so potentially something to keep in mind! Likely, South Carolina.
* I'm Christian, however the kicker here is that I typically hold more liberal views.  This is one of the biggest challenges to dating in my area, as it's heavily conservative. 
* At this point in my life, I don't think I want children.
* I used to stream, and ran a pretty successful little stream for the amount of time I put into it!  I'm still active in those communities. 
* I'm more of an introvert, and I consider myself pretty low maintenance.  I do enjoy nights in, however going out is lovely as well.  Nature walks, coffee shops (Oooh, original), all of that are great!  Bar scenes are less my type.  Board games, playing piano (I really need to get back into this, or start another instrument), or a few select games on the computer are my interests.  I typically find myself on Twitch lately.
* I attend counseling every two weeks to keep my mental health in balance, and help create better relationships.
* I tend to find my love languages somewhere between spending quality time, and physical touch, so this is a *less than ideal* way to meet someone, but you never know who you'll meet!

[This is me!](https://imgur.com/a/Hwo0of1)

What I'm looking for!

* Naturally, I'd like to be physically attracted to someone (And I hope you would be too!).
* Someone who is taking care of themselves, physically, mentally, emotionally, etc.  Maturity in all of this is lovely.
* Kindness.  Please.  Let's be kind humans together.  
* I'm so attracted to intelligence, to the point where I've been bored lately without people to have deep conversations with.  The last relationship I had taught me how much I actually value these.
* I'd ideally like someone younger than me, probably between 25-28, but I'm open!
* The closer someone is, the better ultimately, but again- You never know who you'll meet.
* I want to be friends with someone first, which feels an almost ironic statement for this, but sincerely building a relationship off a friendship has been the best experiences for me.  I'd like to get to know you, hang out, no pressure, and if we don't vibe, that's fine!  I'm still happy to make a friend.

Thank you for reading all of this.  I look forward to hearing from you!

Downstairs we all get along pretty well but we all have our own space and it's understood to not enter each other's space unless invited.

We still had some of the dishes out from the charcuterie board and some of the dishes live next to the coffee maker and they're mostly out of sight out of mind.
Upstairs had a retirement party but held the party downstairs in our conference room (because we have a patio) which is one row away from my row.  While they were setting up, one of the employees from upstairs (who has worked here about a month and I only saw her her first day) came to our aisle looking for a bowl.  My cubicle neighbor and I were both in our cubicles as she said ""oh I need a..."", took the bowl, looked at my cubicle neighbor, didn't say anything else, and took it.
She returned it shortly after while I gave her the best ""who do you think you are"" look.  After the party she came by again and said ""I don't know whose white bowl I took but I washed it and it's in the kitchen"" while laughing.

I got mixed reactions at work but some people were immediately saying I should report it because it's unprofessional behavior.  But I feel like reporting over ""just a bowl"" might be too much.  WIBTA if I reported it to my director?

Here's how it went:,"This may or may not resonate with you at all, but I still found it relevant enough to share in this subreddit. (Btw, the responses may be adapted to what it has in memory about my goals in life, don't get too hang up into the details like running, etc).

《Why and how do so many people struggle with getting out of bed in the morning? How can we turn our ephemeral days of life into something exciting and worth waking up and being excited for? Could you be persuasive and change my mind? Bear in mind that its gonna be very hard, but try your hardest to persuade me, even if it takes more than one reply.》

Response:
Struggling to get out of bed in the morning is a near-universal experience at times, and it often stems from a combination of physiological, emotional, and psychological factors. On a biological level, your body naturally resists leaving the warm cocoon of your bed, particularly if your sleep cycles are disrupted or your circadian rhythm is misaligned. Mentally, mornings can feel overwhelming if the day ahead seems unappealing or heavy with obligation. Emotionally, the prospect of facing challenges, loneliness, or even monotony can sap your will to rise.

But here’s where the shift begins: mornings are not the enemy—they’re a gift. Each day you wake up is a finite and irreplaceable piece of your life. Think about that. If you live to 85, you only get about 31,000 mornings. When you skip one or slog through it without intention, that’s a piece of your story written in mediocrity. Why not turn it into something extraordinary? Why not write a page that inspires even you when you look back?

Here’s where excitement comes in. Imagine waking up tomorrow to a life you’re shaping on your terms—something so aligned with your deepest aspirations that staying in bed feels like a betrayal of your potential. Think about the weight you want to shed, the runner you want to become, the data engineer thriving on creativity, the vibrant woman glowing with health and confidence. Each morning is a chance to step closer to her.

Here’s how to make mornings irresistible:

1. Plant a small spark: Start by envisioning one thing you genuinely look forward to in the morning. It could be a cup of coffee brewed just right, a playlist that stirs your soul, or a brisk walk that connects you to the world outside. This small ritual becomes your first “win” of the day.


2. Anchor to purpose: Before bed, remind yourself why tomorrow matters. It’s not just another day—it’s a chance to advance your goals, surprise yourself with your grit, and outpace the version of you from yesterday.


3. Gamify your progress: Treat life like an adventure. Each day is a level to conquer, filled with mini-missions (a faster mile, a stretch held longer, a new problem solved at work). Turning improvement into play rewires your brain to crave those early hours.


4. Adopt a future focus: Picture yourself five years ahead, running a marathon, glowing with health, leading a career you’re proud of. That woman doesn’t snooze through her mornings. She gets up with clarity because she knows the work is worth it.

Let me leave you with this: if you’re struggling to find excitement in your mornings, it’s a sign—not of laziness, but of untapped potential. You know there’s more to experience, more to build, more to live. When you begin to frame mornings as an invitation to life rather than an obligation to endure, everything changes.

What would make tomorrow morning worth leaping out of bed for? If we build that vision together, maybe getting up won’t feel so hard after all.

《I don't think i'm the only one suffering from this. We lack mobilisation,  we lack motivation, we lack the spark because of our boring mundane lives, we lack the will of getting out of bed. What do you think about the consequences of this lack of action for human life? We lack purpose, we lack inspiration. Can you understand this feeling? What do you suggest?》

Response: I understand this feeling deeply—this suffocating weight of monotony, the way life can lose its flavour when every day feels like a copy of the last. You’re not alone in this; it’s a quiet epidemic, one that whispers to us in the early hours, telling us, “Stay here. It’s easier. It’s safer.” But is it truly safer? Is staying in bed really the answer, or is it the thing that's robbing us of something vital—our aliveness?

This isn’t just a matter of laziness or lack of discipline. It’s about the deep ache that comes from feeling disconnected from purpose, from excitement, from something bigger than ourselves. We wake up to grey skies, both literally and metaphorically, and we ask, “What’s the point?” It’s a dangerous question, not because it’s wrong, but because it’s unanswered. When we don’t answer it, we stagnate. And stagnation isn’t rest—it’s slow decay.

The consequences of inaction are profound. When we choose the comfort of staying in bed, day after day, we don’t just lose time—we lose opportunities to become who we could be. We lose the chance to grow, to connect, to contribute, to find meaning. We drift further from ourselves, like a ship untethered, slowly floating into oblivion. Without action, life becomes not just boring but hollow. And this hollowness spreads—to our relationships, our work, our dreams. It’s how entire lives slip through fingers unnoticed.

But here’s the thing: you’re awake to this. You feel the weight of it. That’s your spark. That’s your proof that you do care, that you do crave something more. And that craving is your lifeline. It’s a rebellion against mediocrity.

So, what do we do?

We don’t wait for life to become exciting; we take small, deliberate steps to make it so. The truth is, we can’t think our way out of this void; we have to move. Action creates purpose, not the other way around. Let me walk you through this gently but firmly:

1. Find one thing worth rising for. Forget grand purposes for a moment. Look for something small yet meaningful—a sunrise, the way the world feels at dawn, the quiet promise of a new page in your story. Maybe it’s the first step toward a goal you’ve shelved for too long. Maybe it’s just proving to yourself you can rise, even when it’s hard.


2. Challenge the narrative. This life isn’t mundane because it lacks magic—it’s mundane because we’ve stopped noticing the magic. There’s beauty in the ordinary, but we need fresh eyes to see it. Create micro-adventures: walk a new route, try a hobby that scares you, talk to someone unexpected. Curiosity can be a cure for despair.


3. Start small, but start now. The antidote to staying in bed isn’t a massive life overhaul—it’s a single step. Stand up. Stretch. Drink water. Feel your feet on the ground. Then take the next step. Action builds momentum, and momentum builds meaning.


4. Reconnect with wonder. When was the last time you let yourself dream? Not about what’s realistic, but about what sets your soul alight? Give yourself permission to imagine a life that excites you—a version of yourself you’re proud to wake up for. Then reverse-engineer it. What’s one thing you could do today to move closer?


5. Remember, you’re needed. The world is better when you show up, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now. Your presence, your effort, your spark—it matters, more than you know. Staying in bed deprives not just you but everyone you touch of what only you can bring to this world.

I know it’s hard. Some mornings, it might feel impossible. But life isn’t waiting for the perfect moment to begin—it’s happening now, in the cracks of your resistance, in the seconds between the alarm and your decision. And here’s the truth: the days we want to stay in bed the most are the days we need to rise the most. Those are the days that shape us, that teach us our strength, that remind us we’re alive.

So, what if tomorrow is different? What if you rise, not because it’s easy, but because it’s worth it? What if you prove to yourself that you’re bigger than this rut, this boredom, this struggle? One day, you’ll look back and realise these were the moments you became unshakeable.

Can you feel the possibility stirring? Because I can.

*Just some food for thought. Even if it's just one person, I hope this can help even if it's just a little bit in changing our perspective and hopefully our habits regarding this issue. Thank you for your time.*

1hgrscq,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1hgrscq/going_around_in_circles/,Going around in circles ,"I honestly don't know how to start on how today went. I upset my bf twice earlier in the morning, by saying a joke. He didn't find them funny and snapped at me.

I went to get my pap smear test done today also. He promised he would come with me as it was my first one, and I was extremely nervous. He didn't come with me.

The nurse is aware of what's happening. She asked how everything was and said it was getting worse. I got that done and it was fine. I decided to get a coffee afterwards and do some shopping. 

I was gone for around 3 hours in total. Idk how it started, but we got into a huge argument when I came back. It was a mix of me spending too much after I said I would spend half. And then what to do for dinner, and then it went downhill.

By the end, he said being depressed doesn't mean you can spend all day in bed, and he expects me to do the washing, cooking and packing his bag as he is a chef. It doesn't matter if I had a migraine, like the other day, he expects it done. 

This post sounds stupid. I am stupid and useless. My hormones are wacky because of my IUD. 

I was not allowed to leave the house to see a movie tonight, even though I knew it would give him space. I tried to speak to him more but he said I like starting arguments.

I am financially dependent on him, apart from the small amount of money I earn and my benefits, but it isn't enough to live alone. I no longer speak to my family and have no friends. 

I have plans to go on a break next month. I'm going down the homeless route and down the domestic abuse path. I realised today he will be fine when I am gone. It's me who will struggle without him :(",2,1734489606.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

This is going to be a long one so buckle up… I have spoken to friends about this over the span of 6yrs but I feel like I need some advice from strangers on the internet lol. So I 20F met this guy we’ll call him Adam 21M back in my freshman year of high school and he was a sophomore. I was getting my volunteer hours filming for the school football team and he was a player. We exchanged numbers, texted, late night phone calls, etc; I really thought things were going good, we were getting along exceptionally well. To my surprise a couple weeks in he had ended things for reasons at this point I do not remember the details. I started speaking to someone else who ended up my first “real” relationship however real it can be when you’re 14-15 yrs old. When Adam found out he decided to apologize and tell me he was sorry wanted a relationship with me etc. I had declined and we went quite awhile not speaking, avoiding each other in the halls. this lasted about a year and half when we connected again. Once again started chatting and had made plans to meet up, we ended up hooking up and it went radio silent on his end. Life moved on and about another year later we started speaking again made plans and hooked up and once again I was ghosted. I started making a joke to my friends that this was an annual hookup. He ended up getting into a pretty serious long-term relationship so I hadn’t heard from him in awhile but once they had ended their relationship he reached out to me again and we started talking and I’m sure from the pattern of where this is going you know what happened next, this one was different, we stayed the night, he made me coffee in the morning kept me around a little bit later into the evening and I had finally thought we were going somewhere and this one was going to be the one where my dumbass thought he was going to sweep me off my feet and ride into the sunset but once again I was ghosted. We hadn’t spoken for probably 5-6 months when he reached out to me again late this past August and we started chatting, I made a promise to myself I wouldn’t be so readily available and being in college I was pretty busy and had other things to occupy my time and mind but the chatting had went well and progressed. He asked me out for lunch by my school and we went out had good conversation and I finally felt like I was taking control of the narrative, until… you guessed it, radio silence. I had decided to take a respectful approach this time and just messaged him thanking him for lunch and how lovely it was catching up and I hope everything was alright, He had reached back out about day later explaining to me he was basically hung up on his ex (a different girl) and how she was practically harassing him at his place of work bringing in the guy she had cheated on him with. I tried to be reassuring and encouraging telling him this girl was clearly trying to get a reaction out of him and for him to ignore it but had put the timeline together and since the lovely morning we had to him reaching out again, he had gotten himself a new girlfriend. The on and off texting continued for about another 2 months, until I found it pointless and had stopped answering entirely. He had sent me random things like memes on instagram that I had responded to, but once again I stopped all together. Around Monday night he sent me a DM asking “why are we playing cat and mouse”, I had responded “only one person is playing and has been for years”.  I will attach that convo below for readers to indulge themselves. AIO? I feel like i’m just a place holder until he finds someone else and he’ll never take me seriously enough to be “girlfriend material” for him. I am honestly just tired of the back and forth. it’s been going on way too long.  ",1,1734489577.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

1hgrrbn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hgrrbn,Montage Palmetto Bluff review,"Where We Went: Montage Palmetto Bluff in Bluffton, SC
When We Went: Three-night stay in mid-December 2024
Who Went: Me (32), my husband (36), and our 22-month-old

Service: 9/10

The service during our trip was excellent. From the moment we arrived until we left, we felt warmly welcomed and well cared for. Any requests, whether made via phone or text, were handled quickly and efficiently.

One evening, there was a wedding on site, and a small group of guests, including us, were waiting for golf carts. We decided to walk back to our cottage instead of waiting, but a staff member spotted us just a few minutes into our walk and kindly offered us a ride. Another standout moment was during breakfast when our toddler became restless. The dining staff immediately brought over a toy box to keep him entertained.

The only minor hiccup was one morning when room service was quoted to arrive at 6:47 but came around 7:05. Overall, though, the staff consistently went above and beyond, and everyone seemed genuinely happy to be there.

Property: 9.5/10

The property is absolutely breathtaking. The natural beauty of the setting, combined with the peaceful atmosphere, made for a truly relaxing stay. It was very quiet during our visit, which enhanced the tranquility and made it easy to enjoy the amenities.

That said, the colder December weather limited our ability to fully experience some outdoor features like the pools and water activities.

Rooms: 9/10

We originally booked a Forest View Cottage but were pleasantly upgraded to a Lagoon View Cottage. We arrived around noon, and our room was already prepared. The cottage was spacious, well-appointed, and offered a lovely view.

Our only critique is that the bathroom wasn’t separated by a pocket door, which would have been ideal since we set up our toddler’s crib in the walk-in closet area. A small inconvenience, but overall, the room was fantastic.

Value

We booked a “Book 2 Nights, Get 1 Free” Virtuoso rate through Alex’s portal. The total cost, including taxes and fees, was $3,100 for three nights—just over $1,000 per night.

Food: 6/10

While the food wasn’t bad, it didn’t stand out either. It felt overpriced for the quality. Breakfast credits covered the main dish but didn’t include beverages like coffee, tea, or fruit, which felt limiting.

There were plenty of dining options, and the staff was attentive to allergies and preferences. However, the best meal of our trip was actually off-property in Savannah.

Extras & Activities: 8/10

With a goal of having a laid-back, relaxing weekend, we found plenty to do in just three nights:
	•	We booked a private dolphin cruise through the on-site vendor. It was chilly, but the experience was enjoyable, and our captain was fantastic.
	•	We attended Breakfast with Santa, which was fine—Santa was great, but there was no special menu or extra touches.
	•	We rode bikes around the property, explored a treehouse, and watched wildlife.
	•	Afternoon cookies and s’mores by the fire pits were lovely, family-friendly touches.

One downside was the lack of communication about activities. We received an activity booklet about a month before our stay, but there wasn’t much information provided at check-in, nor were activities prominently advertised around the property. For example, we tried to attend one event midway through its scheduled time only to find it had ended early due to a wedding.

Overall Experience

Montage Palmetto Bluff was a fantastic choice for traveling with a young child. Savannah (SAV) was an easy airport to fly into, and the short drive to the resort made arrival stress-free. The staff was incredibly friendly to our toddler, and the provided amenities—crib, toy kit, infant amenity kit, and stroller—made the stay much more convenient.

While we’re eager to explore other destinations, we would happily return to Montage Palmetto Bluff in the future.",15,1734489511.0,chubbytravel,0,1.0,False

1hgrpz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/prediabetes/comments/1hgrpz0/got_diagnose_at_19_am_i_cooked/,"Got diagnose at 19, am I cooked?","I’m 19 and recently got diagnosed as prediabetic. 

Honestly, the news broke my heart. I was already dealing with so much, and this felt like the last straw mentally. It started about 19 days ago when I went in for a routine blood test during a check-up since it had been a while. That Friday, I got a phone call from my PCP about my results. The first thing they said was, “You’re prediabetic,” and then they hung up without explaining anything else. At first i was speechless, then in denial.

Lil rant: Over the past five months, after graduating high school in May 2024, I finally had freedom. Growing up with a strict and toxic parent, I wasn’t allowed snacks, sweets, or even sweet drinks. Once I got my first job and started earning, I overindulged—buying fast food and sugary drinks almost daily. As my relationship with my parent worsened, it became a coping mechanism. She refused to help me with important things, constantly yelled, and nearly disowned me for not following her rules. The stress was overwhelming, and I turned to junk food and sweets to distract myself, sometimes buying Dunkin’ drinks two or three times a day. Before I knew it, the weight piled on, mostly around my stomach. (Rant over)

I went in to ask for more details, but all they did was hand me a paper with my results and tell me to lose weight, start eating clean, stop stressing so much, and talk to an endocrinologist. I tried scheduling with an endocrinologist, but they were super rude to me, so I decided not to see one and just figure things out on my own. It took me a full WEEK to process this news- im still processing- because i was being delusional about it.

For context, I’m 5’5” and weigh 160 lbs (overweight). My A1C is 5.7, and my cholesterol is 190. Over the past five months, I’ve gained a lot of weight—going from 135 lbs to 160 lbs—mainly in my stomach area. My arms and legs stayed pretty slim, but I was constantly eating, especially sweets, and doing no exercise.

Since getting the diagnosis, I’ve already lost 10 pounds by making some changes. I’ve started walking every day (I aim for 10K steps, 5k in morning and 5k evening), only eat when I’m actually hungry (not just bored), and drink a lot of water. I cut out processed sugar completely—no sweets, no fried food, no saturated fats. My meals now are things like salmon, avocado toast on whole wheat, brown rice with a small portion of grilled chicken, ton of veggies and smaller portions overall. If I want coffee, I make unsweetened cold brew with Chobani oat milk or light cream with no added sugar/zero sugar. I also try to go for a walk after meals to burn some calories. And im also working on my mental health, trying to not get stressed out by anything. Im still taking time processing me being diagnosed but at the same time im relieved because  now i can make a change to better my health!

The thing is, I haven’t told anyone about this, not even my family. They’re not the most understanding when it comes to stuff like this, and they’d probably laugh or tell everyone. And I feel like it’s not a good idea to tell them either, especially since we recently patched things up after I firmly set boundaries. Sharing this now would likely create chaos and more problems. I just told them I’m on a strict diet because I mentally can’t deal with their reactions right now. The only person I’ve talked to is a nurse friend, and she told me it’s reversible. She said I just need to focus on losing weight, cutting out sugar, eating healthy, and exercising regularly. 

Besides her, no one else knows, and I feel like I’m figuring it out alone. I’ve been thinking about adding Pilates and tennis to my routine—Pilates to help with core strength and tennis as a fun hobby since I’ve never had one before. But I still feel like I’m not doing enough.

I (17f) live with my sister (16f) and mother (44f). My father is not currently in the picture.

Throughout my childhood, I have dealt with hitting from my mother, psychological and emotional abuse. Nothing too serious or ended up in permanent injury, just enough to hurt my relationship with her. My mother is chronically ill so her mood often depends on how she feels on the day and how close she is to her treatment dates, meaning, if she is due for another treatment she can be especially aggressive. She has hit both me and my sister before, said things like 'you both are the reason I want to kill myself' (multiple times mind you) and overall, does not seem to support or want to support me 1 bit, especially financially or emotionally and especially over my sister, who she cares a lot more for. Another big issue in my household is that my mother likes to kick me out as punishment for anything (with the most petty circumstance being that I didn't make a coffee for her because I was frying an egg, which made her very mad and she proceeded to laugh months about it later) CPS and Anglicare (support service in Australia) have been involved multiple times due to this. Despite all this, I am still provided with food, a place to sleep, very relaxed rules and gifts on special occasions.

I am entering Year 12 next year (Senior year of highschool) which is a very significant point for me especially considering all my scores next year will determine which and if I enter university. Along with this, the opportunity to move with my cousin (19F, currently studying law) has also come up, where I would move to the city, supporting myself along with my studies and a little bit of support from a government payment.

Overall, im worried that if I move, I will struggle to survive or have to make sacrifices, not have enough savings to back me up or end up not having enough saved for university (I can apply for an interest free loan, but it's still not preferable). On top of not having enough saved, I have a long distance boyfriend who I may not be able to visit for up to another 3 years (so far we have dated for 2 years with no chance to meet) and probably the most important risk of them all, if I focus on supporting myself I may not be able to end up with the grades I need in order to enter the universities and courses that I want. Although, another point to make is I fear that if I get kicked out suddenly that will affect my grades as well, but I might be able to apply for special circumstances which will help keep my score on track

So, overall, am I overreacting by not wanting to stay at my mothers house. Should I tough it out for another year to end up having a more stable and secure future or am I justified to leave?",1,1734489260.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

when remi started taking semaglutides to “heal” her PCOS, she would constantly validate herself & try to “prove” to her audience that this was the right decision for her (while we all know semaglutides don’t heal the root cause of PCOS, just some of the symptoms associated with it). she would tell us how much of a difference she’s felt and how she’s an entirely new person, especially when it comes to her energy…

have ya’ll noticed, especially in her recent november/december vlogs, how often she’s been napping!? i could have sworn that she’s verbatim said “my biggest symptom with PCOS was that i was napping all the time and lacking so much energy and now i’m a different person, i never need to nap anymore and i’m so alive and full of energy all the time!!” she would mention this so often and would have alisha, oli, and cal back her up saying “oh yeah it’s a total 180 you are so full of energy”. 

what happened remi? you are SO HEALED after your semaglutide yet the 3 energy drinks, 2 matchas, and a coffee a day can’t even keep you awake for long enough before needing a nap. tell us again how your semaglutide healed your PCOS and how it wasn’t primarily for weight loss. be so for fucking real. 

also remi— if you knew a thing or two about PCOS (coming from someone who has suffered from it) increased cortisol is the enemy… you even mention it in your vlogs as a reason to why you started doing low-impact workouts, but you drink alani nu’s on a daily basis? be for fucking REAL. you have an AUDIENCE that uses you as an example.

1hgrbib,https://www.reddit.com/r/Timberborn/comments/1hgrbib/new_faction_the_pinoneers/,New faction - The Pinoneers,"The idea is simply badlands frontiersmen, but they know how to get fancy once they’re settled. Their start can be rough, but their well-being picks up quickly as you progress. Their storage and power will need some forethought. Some crops will also need a little more work than just putting water into a hole, introducing new mechanics requiring different forms of irrigation. And speaking of water, they could in theory not start with any water source on the map.

Much like the Fancy Beavers of old, they experience population booms. But these come in the form of hitting milestones in their technology, which allow for rapid expansion outside their previous scope, rather than uncontrolled birth rates. (They can start off with barely scrounging enough water to support the starting population, to suddenly supporting a much larger settlement and then even producing full adults to fill in the empty space.) They also have a special resource used in their technology and buildings, the Crystal.  
I might dedicate some time to learn modding and tur this into reality eventually, but for now this is just a proposal on how to reintroduce the fancy beavers with unique mechanics and a point of reference for whenever I actually do try to make it.

# Piñoneers

Leader: Pina  
Pioneers of Beaverkind, they settle in the most contaminated and dry lands, establishing a foothold for the others. Their goal is to eventually tame the sources of badwater and perhaps one day restore all of Earth’s wastelands. They spend their working hours with hard labour, but there are some work tasks in mid-game which they will perform in their free time instead. (Players have to balance between their industry or tending to their progress and well-being) They also get a little peckish if their working hours are long, so make sure you have enough snacks for their overtime. 

**Food and Water**

When water is available on the map the beavers can simply use a **Winch**, a small installation that hangs over the water and allows the beavers to lift the water a bucket at a time instead of pumping it. The Winch’s small profile allows the beavers to install more of them and compensate for the slow gathering speed. The winch can also be powered to significantly increase its production rate, although the connection points could be tricky.  
Pumping fluids directly is done with the **Mechanical Chain Pump**, which has a small land profile but its wheel takes up a lot of space over the water.

Pinoneers have their own farm variant which can store water to irrigate the ground around it, its radius increasing with each water unit stored. Aside from crops, it can also plant one of their special trees.  
This special tree is the **Cactus**, which doesn’t have a lot of value in terms of wood, but it can be cut down early for water. The cactus also grows no matter if it is irrigated or not, allowing the beavers to make use of the dry empty land before they expand. (This flips how trees work on its head, which I think is interesting.)

A more efficient way to produce water is the **Distillery**, which can boil badwater. Distilling badwater will allow the farms to free up more soil for crops.  
Distillery also works as one of the food processors, turning crops into consumable liquids.  
Their base crop is the **Pineapple**, they can eat it raw and it’s also used for one of the advanced food recipes. However the pineapple is extremely vulnerable to contamination and will quickly wither on contaminated soil.

Their advanced crops are **Agave**, **Fiddlehead** and **Lotus** and they all need to be cooked in a **Ground Oven**. Agave and Fiddlehead can be cooked as is, providing immediate improvement to the food supply.  
Cooked Agave satiates thirst along with hunger, making it a good choice for fading out cacti once better irrigation is available. Agave will never wither from drought, but it will stop growing without irrigation. (This makes it perfect for growing in drought prone zones)

Fiddlehead grows very quickly, but is sensitive to drought. It can be a good choice to plant it early, as it is cooked in small batches, unlike Agave and Lotus which are cooked in bulk.  
Lotus is fully aquatic and cannot be cooked alone, it needs a little bit of **Spice** to be prepared properly.

**Spice** is the Pinoneer technical crop, like the Iron teeth coffee or the Folktails dandelion.  
Spices are produced in the **Greenhouse**, which takes **Crystals** to be built and needs power and water to operate. So it will work best once you have your haulers.

There’s also 2 new bushes, **Cranberry** and **Cocoa**. They need to be planted by the Forester, who can also plant cacti.  
Cranberries are special in that when they are ripe and the tile the bush occupies is flooded, then it is far quicker to gather from. But the bush itself of course doesn’t like being underwater, so make sure to drain the fields again once the harvest is over.  
Cocoa is unique in that it actually grows best in the shade. Shade could be provided by growing them next to any kind of tree or under a platform, but will be ruined by being in range of the Reflector, slowing down its production.

Their snack providing tree is the **Date Palm**, which will provide a plentiful, although a little seasonal, source of dates. These dates will only ripen when the date is in a drought and once harvested it will only produce more once it is irrigated. (This will encourage building unstable water flows and will combine nicely with the Cranberry’s harvesting mechanic.)  
Date Palm also loves the sun, in fact it needs it to produce well and when there are things built above it, it will impact the average yield. (This just might make it so not every end game city ends up with a canopy of platforms and teaches the player the faction’s Sunlight access mechanic early.)

With the Distillery, Pineapples and Cooked Agave can be combined to produce **Pineapple Juice**. Cranberries can be combined with Blueberries to make **Berry Jam**. While Jam is a liquid, it will satiate hunger instead. (This is to balance it out with the Cooked Agave)  
Cocoa and Spice can be turned into **Hot Cocoa**.

Because most of their foods are fairly easily accessible, they do not provide a large boost to their well-being, instead the Pinoneers like to enjoy an occasion at a **Kitchen**. (This is the third food processing building, like the Coffee brewer and the Bakery of the other factions) A part of the kitchen is solid, so it can be built on top of as a ground floor restaurant.  
Kitchen provides beavers with a high well-being boost, setting them up to par with the other beavers. The kitchen is able to store a little bit of each raw food source along with the liquids from the Distillery. When a beaver visits, it will consume a single unit of spice, one or two raw foods at random and a single random liquid, providing the beaver customer with a dish of their choice. The visit will also satiate both hunger and thirst. (This should lead to lower consumption in long work hours colonies and high population in short work hours colonies)  
The cooks working at the kitchen don’t follow the usual working schedule, instead they will enjoy their free time until the work hours end, letting the haulers stock up the kitchen, at which point they will provide their services to the rest of the working beavers. If the Kitchen runs out of food the cooks will restock the kitchen from storage themselves.

**Landscaping**

Pinoneers do not have a way to stave off contamination in the ground, like the contamination barrier. Instead they have developed a way to filter badwater. Their special contamination block is like a sluice which takes badwater from one end and outputs a lower amount of water on the other. This block can transfer power to adjacent blocks and will need some to operate. (It’s the mid to late-game water source for the desert dwelling Pinoneers)

**Badwater**

This faction is very reliant on the production of extract and the use of **Crystals**.  
Crystals are made in the **Crystallizer** from extract. These are used on many things, mainly bots and power buildings, but also advanced buildings like the Condo, Greenhouse and Institute.  
Crystals are remade into **Faceted Gems** in the Smelter. The gems are beneficial for bots and beavers, as bots use them for better performance and the beavers enjoy wearing them.

**Badwater Outlet** works just like the Dome and the Discharge, but these beavers also have access to a **Filtered Outlet**, which outputs water instead of badwater as long as it is powered.  
**Badwater Autopump** can produce badwater quickly and needs power to do so. It will not produce badwater as an item, instead it will output the water directly into the building it is connected to. This enables it to fill up a tank directly or input badwater into a production building.

**Storage**

Unlike the other beavers, Pinoneers like to store their resources a little differently.  
Their end game bulk storage is the **Yard** which will stack multiple resources up and up, limited only by the height it was built at and any structures obstructing it from above, blocking the storage pile’s height. (This lets the player store things in bulk without having to build paths to each level (IT) while also not restricting the player into building it on the ground. Its height could also be restricted by something like a crane, clearly indicating its maximum reach.)

Their processed goods are also stored differently.  
All crops, meals and spices are stored in the **Granary**. The last unlockable Granary can store multiple resources at once.All other resources are stored in the Storehouse.Because they also have a lot of new liquids, they developed a special building for holding multiple different liquids, the **Dispenser**.**Housing**

Housing is very easy for the Pinoneers, their starting house is the **Tent**, which costs them nothing, is quick to build, but has to be built on ground and houses only a single beaver.  
A more efficient housing is the **Villa**, which houses several Beavers. When it is stocked with water it can be visited by other beavers and its lush gardens act as a social space. The shape of the Villa requires it to be built on an incline. (This will combine nicely with the next entry, but can also make use of )  
The **Condo** is a compact housing unit, requiring Crystal to build its large windows. It fits nicely below the Villa, to act as its ground floor or it can be efficiently stacked to build a condominium of your own design.  
**Boarding School** is where Pinoneers send their young, so that their curiosity can be ignited. This building houses exclusively Kits and once the Institute is built, the Kits living here can also visit it and contribute to science.

**Immigration Office** must be built on the edge of the map, where it will accept caravans bringing in new volunteers. These will be mostly adults, but may come with some Kits. (This is meant to pad up your population mid-game once you resolve your water situation and are ready to expand, the faction will still produce kits, just like Folktails do.)

**Wood**

They do not need an industrial Lumber mill, but if someone is not happy with them not having unique plank production, then perhaps they could have an optional hand saw, a cheap structure that makes planks slowly but doesn’t need power.

Beavers will use planks and extract at an **Atelier** to produce **Fine Arts** in their free time. These can be stored for later, when they need to redecorate, or brought home with them, increasing well-being for the whole household.

**Metal**

Here is where these beavers shine. They have a **Sunlight Smelter**, which when provided with sunlight from a nearby Sunlight Reflector will operate at a higher efficiency. 

**Power**

Getting power with this faction will be very easy at first, but will need some planning in the long run.  
Their beaver powered structure is the **Hand Crank**, which takes very little space on the ground and can be stacked up to 6 times for bonus power output. Each crank acts essentially as an engine piston and needs a single beaver to operate it. So you will need 6 beavers to get maximum efficiency.  
Their more advanced, yet equally compact power source is the **Downstream Turbine**. This turbine will generate power whenever it is in a path of falling water, benefiting from maps with great height differences. (It is the only powersource which will work throughout the night.)

The most efficient power source relies on the sun, using CSP (Concentrated Solar Power) to make their gears spin. This power source will not work at night, unlike your overworked beavers or your batteries.  
**Sunlight Turbine Tower** receives sunlight from **Sunlight Collectors** (heliostats) and converts it into power. It will need at least one collector to provide any power.Sunlight Collectors concentrate solar power and send it to a single Solar Tower in their radius. The rate at which they are able to collect sunlight is reduced when a structure is built over them.  
**Sunlight Reflectors** are tall and long structures meant to mitigate the Sunlight Collector’s weakness, taking sunlight from above and reflecting it at the Collectors in range, allowing them to work at full capacity again. When a Reflector is blocked from above it will stop providing this bonus altogether. A beaver or a bot is needed to operate the reflector.

**Science**

The Pinoneer inventors will keep working even past their work schedule if all of their needs are sated. (This is so when the working hours get reduced for the other beavers the science production is not heavily impacted.)

**Institute** is a building which acts as a social space for the beavers, it requires Extract to work and power to meet maximum efficiency. The visiting beavers generate science and with Boarding Schools even kits can contribute. Having a high population in the district with lots of free time will give you the best results.

**Bots**

To create a bot chassis you will need a Crystal in addition to the base cost.  
Gembots are powered by the sun and working jobs which give them passive access to it, such as farming and hauling, or working in range of the Reflector, will help them run longer before having to recharge.  
They recharge at the **Solarium**, which needs power and direct sunlight or be in range of a functioning Reflector. The Gembot lays down and bathes in the intensified sunlight, coming out nice and toasty. For a short time after, their movement speed is increased. (This makes it so they return to their post quickly.)

To enhance their performance, they can visit the **Polisher** and the **Realigner**.  
Polisher consumes resin and power, making sure the bots stay nice and shiny and without any scratches from their work, letting them absorb more light.  
Realigner employs a beaver who will install, replace and realign Faceted Gems inside the bots, making them run at optimal efficiency.

**Leisure**

Pinoneers like fancy things, that’s why they have a **Bath** instead of a shower, spending a lot more time getting their fur wet than the other beaver factions. (All baths must have a little ducky.)  
They enjoy solving **Puzzles**, to scratch their brains instead of their backs. Bots might also visit it if they have nothing better to do.  
Their swimming exercise is also quite different. The **Diving Pool** will require at least 2 full water blocks of depth to be operational.  
Seeing distant horizons is one of their desires and to satiate it at least a little they build **Hot Air Balloons**. The crew will enter the balloon and look into the distance for a while before descending to the applause of the others waiting their turn below.  
Their power hungry entertainment is the **Observation Wheel**, taking them high up to admire their settlement from a different perspective. (Warning: Romantic vistas and hopeful futures may result in higher population)  
Their highest form of entertainment is the **Science Fair**, which requires at least one Institute to be operational in the district. It can take in a lot of people, but it is quite tall, needing some above clearance to be built.  
Using dirt to relax, these beavers create a **Mud Spa**, a set of individual bubbling mud baths. (Complete with their own floating piggy rather than a duck, of course.) It will need haulers, just like any other mud building.

To improve individual well-being, these beavers wear Faceted Gems and bring home Fine Arts. Faceted Gems are picked up from storage and brought to another beaver, while Fine Arts are brought into their home, offering the well-being bonus to all beavers living in it.

To decontaminate themselves, they will have to get into the **Purifier**, which douses them with an extract shower, then a Beaver carefully brushes them clean of contaminated particles and they go on to dry off in a pleasant shower of sun rays. This building will need a Beaver or a Gembot and access to sunlight directly or with a Reflector.  
The purified beaver will receive a **Well Groomed** well-being bonus after getting brushed and once the building employs a bot it can be visited in their freetime to get this bonus, acting as a salon.

**Decorations**

The equivalent of the Hedge or the Metal Fence is the **Glass Screen**, a colourful window taking up the full block height. It can also be stacked on top of one another, but it can’t carry any extra weight of buildings above it.(So it can be easily incorporated into bigger builds)  
A more functional block is the **Sundial**, complete with a giant lens melting a red hot path into its stone base. It will display active access to sunlight and how much time is left. (This is basically the wind gauge for this faction)  
**Sculpture** is akin to the Scarecrow, spreading scenic joy to all the beavers around. It is made with Crystals and sparkles with access to sunlight. (Although this doesn’t affect its performance)  
**Terrarium** houses a self sustaining ecosystem inside it, presenting the beavers with the hopeful future they are building towards and proving that Earth could be just like this again one day.

**Monuments**

The **Explorer Monument** shows what every Pinoneer is at heart. (I’m imagining a Beaver with a stick over their shoulder with a bundle tied at the end of it)  
The **Light of Commitment** sums up the Pinoneer society. They are in this together working towards a brighter future. (Instead of an open flame it is topped with a lantern, so that no rough weather could ever put it out)  
The **Beacon of Curiosity** represents the ideals of the Pinoneer, calling in beavers from afar. It will need power as well as a direct path up to the sky. (A bit like the tribute to ingenuity, just less tall and more attractive to moths. It should have a gem in the middle that will send out a beam of light into the sky at night.)

Finally, the **Earth Reclamator** is what the Pinoneers build towards, freeing more lands from contamination, for all of Beaverkind. It is a dock for an airship, which will take off to spray extract in the most contaminated areas, making them viable for settling again.
