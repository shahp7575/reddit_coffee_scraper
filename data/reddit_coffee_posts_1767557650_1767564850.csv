1q437wn,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1q437wn/aita_for_telling_my_ex_i_chose_stability_over/,"AITA for telling my ex I 'chose stability over passion' with my husband. he overheard, contacted a divorce lawyer, and now his family is icing me out?","My husband heard me tell my ex that marrying him was ""choosing stability over passion"" and now he won't come home.

I was at coffee with my ex-boyfriend from college. We stayed friends, my husband knows about him, it's never been weird. Except yesterday my ex brought up his engagement and asked if I ever wondered what would've happened if we'd stayed together. And I laughed and said something like ""I chose the safe option with my husband, you know? Financial security, reliability. You were exciting but I needed stability.""

My husband was supposed to be across town at his mother's house. He wasn't. He was walking past the coffee shop window and he saw us. He came in and the look on his face made my stomach drop.

""Safe option?"" he said. His voice was flat. ""That's what I am to you?""

I tried to explain but my ex just sat there looking uncomfortable and my husband kept staring at me like he'd never seen me before.

""You should be grateful,"" I told him, because it came out wrong but I meant that I chose him, that I picked stability because that's what adults do. ""I could've stayed with passion and drama but I chose you. That's a compliment.""

He walked out. Just turned around and left me sitting there.

He won't answer my calls. His brother texted me that he's staying at his place and he told his whole family what I said. His mother called me crying asking how I could reduce her son to a ""backup plan."" His sister sent me a paragraph about how I never deserved him.

I went to his brother's apartment yesterday. My husband came outside and he looked exhausted.

""I need you to understand I worded it badly,"" I said. ""I love you. I chose you.""

""You settled for me,"" he said. ""You told your ex you gave up passion for a 401k and health insurance.""

""That's not what I meant.""

""Yeah it is."" He rubbed his face. ""I spent seven years thinking you loved me the way I love you. I thought I was your person. Turns out I'm just the safe option. The fallback guy.""

""You're twisting my words.""

""I'm done being your backup plan,"" he said, and went back inside.

His brother texted me this morning. My husband contacted a divorce attorney. A divorce attorney. Over something I said that came out wrong when I was just trying to be honest with an old friend.

Everyone's acting like I committed some unforgivable sin. His cousin posted something on Facebook about ""knowing your worth"" that's clearly about me. My own mother said I ""really stepped in it this time"" when I tried to explain.

I just meant that mature love is different than young love. That choosing someone stable and reliable is smart, not settling. That passion fades but partnership lasts. Why is everyone making this into me not loving my husband?

He cleaned out his closet while I was at work today. Took his gaming setup, his books, the coffee maker he bought. Left his wedding ring on the kitchen counter.

I don't know how to fix this. I've sent him probably fifty texts trying to explain. I told him I worded it badly, that of course I love him, that he's taking this too far. He responded once: ""You said what you meant. Now I'm doing what I should've done before I wasted seven years on someone who was just checking boxes.""

His best friend blocked me on everything. His sister changed her profile picture to one of her and my husband from his graduation with the caption ""always got your back."" I'm being iced out of his entire life over a poorly phrased comment.

Maybe I should've been more careful with my words but is this really divorce-worthy? Am I missing something? I feel like I'm going crazy because everyone's treating this like I cheated when all I did was admit I made a mature choice instead of an emotional one.

AITAH?

1q436t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AaronJhinkoo/comments/1q436t5/when_ice_becomes_a_hidden_charge/,When Ice Becomes a Hidden Charge,"A small but telling practice has become normal in many coffee shops. Customers order a drink by size, receive a full cup, and only later realize that much of what they paid for is ice. The cup looks generous, but the actual liquid content is noticeably less. While this may not breach any written law, it raises a fair question about honesty and respect in everyday transactions.  
  
No one disputes that ice has a place in cold beverages. It chills the drink and, in moderation, improves the experience. The issue arises when ice is used less as an ingredient and more as a substitute. When half a cup is frozen water, the customer is effectively paying beverage prices for something that costs the business almost nothing. That may be clever from a profit standpoint, but it does not sit well from a consumer perspective.  
  
In Trinidad and Tobago, many of us are already adjusting to higher costs across the board. Groceries, utilities, transport, and services continue to climb. In that context, people are paying closer attention to value. When a drink is marketed by size, the natural assumption is that the size reflects a reasonable amount of the product itself, not a visual illusion created by ice.  
  
The law may not require coffee shops to state the exact millilitre content of every drink they serve. That does not mean businesses should avoid transparency. Ethical business practices often go beyond what the law strictly demands. Fair dealing is not only about legality. It is also about trust.  
  
When customers feel shortchanged, even in small ways, confidence erodes. They may not complain. They may not return. Over time, these quiet decisions matter. Businesses that rely on repeat customers should understand that perceived fairness plays a major role in loyalty.  
  
There are simple ways to address this without regulation or confrontation. Coffee shops could offer customers a choice of ice levels as standard practice, not as a special request. Menus could clarify whether cup size refers to total volume or beverage volume. Staff could be trained to explain options without making customers feel difficult for asking.  
  
Some might argue that customers can simply request less ice. That places the burden on the consumer to correct a practice they did not create. Fairness works best when honesty is the default, not something a customer must negotiate for at the counter.  
  
Calling excessive ice a hidden tax may sound dramatic, but the comparison is not far off. The customer pays the same price and receives less of what they actually wanted. It may be legal. It may be widespread. That does not automatically make it right.  
  
As consumers, we are becoming more aware of how value is presented to us. As businesses, there is an opportunity to respond with clarity rather than tactics. Transparency costs little. Trust is worth much more.  
  
Respecting customers does not require new laws. It requires a willingness to serve what is promised, not just what looks full.",1,1767564561.0,u_AaronJhinkoo,0,1.0,False

I am not great at jumping into crowded chats or keeping up with fast paced small talk. I am much better when the conversation is calm easy and actually has some substance.

I am 32 and live in Michigan. I am 5 10 with an athletic build brown hair and green eyes. I work as a mechanic at a factory so my days can be long and my schedule is not always typical but I enjoy what I do. After work I usually recharge at home or outside depending on the season.

Warm months I am happiest being outdoors hiking kayaking camping or just finding a quiet place to unwind. Cold months I slow down and enjoy reading cooking watching shows and spending time with a good cup of coffee. I am more of a homebody but still appreciate getting out once in a while.

I realized I miss having someone to talk to regularly. Not looking to rush into anything or force a certain outcome. Just hoping to find a comfortable connection that grows naturally through conversation.

1q432yr,https://i.redd.it/rovwb887oebg1.gif,Across County Road 12,"hii again 🐴 I’m back with something a bit different! Welcome to the ranch 🥸

**Across County Road 12**

You play as a burned-out city vet tech who runs as far as they can from an ex and lands a six-month contract at Ridgeview Stock Farm in Cedar Ridge, Montana. Ridgeview is the shiny, image-perfect ranch with steel barns, spreadsheets, and a boss who cares a little too much about how everything looks. Across County Road 12 sits Hayes Ranch: older, poorer, stubbornly alive, and run by Jackson Hayes—the “good Hayes boy” some people trust with their lives and others swear ruined a Ridgeview Morgan girl for good.

You step straight into the middle of a decades-old feud, trying to keep calves breathing and clients happy while everyone quietly chooses a side. Long days blur into late-night emergency calls, diner coffee, bar fights that almost happen, and way too many moments alone with a rancher who keeps showing up when things go sideways—and who is a very careful, very private Dom once the door shuts.

This scenario blends small-town drama, working-ranch routine (fence checks, calving wrecks, bad weather), slow-burn romance, family mess, gossip, and optional 18+ NSFW/BDSM dynamics. 

Go ride that cowboy 🥳

1q432xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1q432xj/aio_i_39f_found_out_my_husband_26m_might_be_gay/,AIO I (39F) found out my husband (26M) might be gay and having an affair,"Throaway account as my friends and husband have my main account. 

So for context, my husband (26M) and I (39F) have been married for 5 years, together for 8 years. We met at work and have many mutual friends. 

When we first started dating, he had this friend whom he was very close with and often went for coffee with, we'll call him Marcus (27M). Marcus moved away late 2024 to help a sick family member across the country. 

While Marcus was away, my husband, who we'll call Nick, was less willing to go on dates with me and spend time with me as a whole. I noticed that he also stopped doing chores around the house, such as putting dishes away or general putting items in their designated spots. He seemed more careless, more down and irritable too. The only time his mood seemed to improve was when he was video calling with Marcus, sometimes slightly after too. 

A couple months ago, Marcus moved back into the area and they started meeting up again. I noticed a perk in Nick's general mood and behaviour, which I was happy about. Nick has recently started staying out late with Marcus on days where we had plans to spend time together. I have joked several times about Nick and Marcus's ""little dates"" and Nick seemed to act very defensively, and once even walked out after I had joked about it. 

I've met Marcus once or twice at birthdays and other celebrations, and he seems like a really nice guy and I was happy that Nick had such a good friend, although I felt something was off in our interactions. Marcus seems cautious around me and keeps behaving anxiously to the point where I feel he's trying to avoid certain subjects such as constantly seeing Nick or anything to do with Nick, really. We only really speak about trivial things, such as the weather or plans for the week.

Marcus came over a couple weeks ago to pick Nick up to go out together. As I waved them goodbye from the door and as I turned around to close the door, I saw them checking behind them frequently so they could see when I'm gone, probably. I have seen them in the town centre holding hands while walking, specifically when I told Nick I would be elsewhere, such as at work, home, or with a family member. After I began to notice these things, I placed an Air tag in his bag so I could follow him to see if I would see anything else. Long story short, I did.

He started going to Marcus's place when he told me he was with family or other friends. When he would come home, I would notice he would smell strongly of Marcus's cologne. Now, I know what you're probably thinking; how do I know what his cologne smells like? When I met Marcus, he was a very lovely chap and I found myself rather enamoured by him. However, when Marcus kept avoiding conversation with me, I was somewhat heartbroken. I'm going to be honest, if I wasn't married to Nick, I would pursue a relationship with Marcus, myself. I will admit that I have been following them while they are in public with disguises, as my best friend is a cosplayer and has been helping me remain hidden in public while following Nick and Marcus.

Last night, I got into a disagreement with Nick. He had caught onto me following him when he's on these ""dates"" with Marcus. He accused me of stalking him, which I would never do, as I'm not that sort of creepy person in Netflix documentaries, I love my husband and would never in my life wish anything bad upon him.

But recently I noticed he has been a lot more secretive with his devices. For context here, we shared devices and he was normally very open with me and letting me borrow his phone if needed. This behaviour sent alarm bells going on my head, so I spoke with my best friend and she told me that I should search his phone while he was either asleep or in the shower. 

So I did just that.

After the argument last night, he got into the shower and left his phone on the bedside table. Without a second thought, I unlocked his phone and immediately checked through the messages between him and Marcus.

What I found shocked me.

Marcus was saved in Nick's phone as ""Marcus 💞"". I began to scroll through the messages, they were calling eachother pet names such as ""my darling"" or ""sweetheart""  and sending kisses in almost every message, something Nick doesn't even do for ME. HIS WIFE. HIS WIFE OF 5 YEARS. 

I then checked his camera roll. I found hundreds of images of them holding hands, hugging, kissing, on dates and MORE. 

I grabbed my phone and called my best friend, who picked me up. I told Nick I was staying at hers for the night to cool off from the argument, while in reality, we were on the way to Marcus's place. Keys in hand, my best friend and I slash Marcus's tyres and smash the windscreen of his crappy fiat 500 with absolutely zero remorse. My friend suggested doing this as she knew Marcus would not be able to afford repairs. Surely that would send him the message to back off from my husband. SURELY?

No.
It didn't. 

I saw them THIS MORNING. Nick was on Marcus's doorstep, holding him close as Marcus was sobbing about the crappy little car.

I told my brother what happened and he cursed me out, threatened to report me to the police and now my family are calling me a ""predator"" (my brother told the family) because of the age gap between my husband and I. They are also calling me a ""psycho"" for my actions 🙄. He said I badly overreacted but I don't think I did. My husband still doesn't know it was me that keyed Marcus's car.

My dental hygiene is good (I think, I definitely could stand to floss more often) and as of yet I’ve never had a cavity. I use Sensodyne Repair & Whitening toothpaste. 

All that to say, dental health is really important to me and it gives me anxiety to think of something bad happening to my teeth. BUT I’m a huge lemonade and lemon lover. I don’t have it daily, but I’m thinking of having Earl grey tea/lemonade mix drinks in the morning for caffeine since I’m not a coffee drinker and like to spice up my tea drinks every once in a while. I wouldn’t add a lot of lemonade—probably just 4-8oz or so, possibly even less than 4oz. It’s also organic lemonade and not excessively sugary—not sure if that matters. 

I won’t do this every week but just thought maybe 1-2 weeks a month I’d have this as my morning drink. Am I crazy? Will this absolutely ruin my teeth? Is there anything I can do to ensure I can have this without damaging my teeth? (I already chew xylitol gum and would happily do so after drinking it.

I do drink one cup of coffee each morning (half caff) but pretty much only drink water throughout the day.

1q42uf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PointlessStories/comments/1q42uf1/cuban_breakfast/,Cuban breakfast,"When my son was young, we'd meet up with my father on Saturday mornings to get Cuban breakfast. Cuban breakfast is pretty much the same as American breakfast, except the coffee is cafe con leche and the toast uses Cuban bread.

My father lived across town, so we'd meet somewhere in the middle, and we'd drive over listening to This American Life on the radio. As soon as we'd enter the restaurant, a busy spot, we'd be hit with the smell of the coffee and the bread on a grill, and the sound of the espresso machine going full blast, and find a table with my father waiting for us while drawing on the paper place mat. He always drew the waitress as a way of flirting with her and even now, years after his death, I meet waitresses who remember him affectionately. 

My father was in his 70s and my son was 7; I remember this clearly because it was an element in my exasperation on this particular day. Sitting down at the table, waiting to give our order, my son and my father both would both start talking, without looking to see if anyone else was talking to me, each expecting my complete and total attention. Because he was losing his hearing my father was constantly saying ""Huh? What was that?"" 

At a certain trying point, when determining whether it was fried or scrambled that my son wanted, bacon or ham, French or home fries, my father interrupted to tell me something but my son kept on dithering. I finally burst out, ""You two! You're dumb and dumber!""

Whereupon my son looked at me, straight in the eyes, as he knelt on the booth seat, crayon in hand, pointed to his grandfather, and said, ""Ok, but *he's* dumber.""

Meanwhile my father kept on asking me ""What? What did you say?"" and when I repeated my comment more loudly, a number of times, he looked at his grandson and said, ""Ok, but *he's* dumber,"" with a very old man smirk on his face.

I'm telling you, they had the same taste in movies and cartoons. I'd take them both to all the LOTR and Star Wars premieres. They were both very well behaved then.",5,1767563747.0,PointlessStories,0,1.0,False

Picture this: You’re scrolling through your bank app, sighing at the numbers like they’re a bad Tinder match. *""Ugh, will this ever be enough?""* Meanwhile, your savings account is over there, quietly flexing like an undercover millionaire.

Here’s the truth: **Most people underestimate how far their savings can actually take them.** A few tweaks, a little strategy, and suddenly, that ""meh"" balance starts looking like a retirement fund with *serious* potential.

### **How to Turn Your Savings Into a Retirement Powerhouse**
1. **The ""Lattee Factor"" Myth (But Make It Real)**
   - You’ve heard it: *""Skip coffee, retire rich!""* Yeah, no. Instead, ask: *What’s one expense I won’t even miss in 5 years?* (Spoiler: It’s probably not your morning caffeine fix.)
   - Redirect *that* money into a high-yield account or investment. Small moves, big payoff.

2. **Your Savings Account is a Lazy Roommate**
   - If it’s earning 0.01% interest, it’s basically napping on your couch. Time to upgrade to a **high-yield savings account** or a low-risk investment.
   - *Pro tip:* Automate transfers so you never ""forget"" to pay future-you.

3. **The Retirement Calculator No One Talks About**
   - Most tools make you feel broke. But what if you could see *exactly* how your current savings could grow? **You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement. [https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb)**
   - *(Affiliate link—because even future-you deserves a little help.)*

4. **The ""What If?"" Game (But Fun)**
   - *""What if I invested $100/month for 20 years?""* (Answer: A lot.)
   - *""What if I waited 5 more years?""* (Answer: Less. A lot less.)
   - Play with numbers—it’s like a crystal ball, but with math.

### **The Bottom Line**
Your savings isn’t just a number—it’s a *story*. And right now, you’re the author. Will it be a tale of *""I wish I started sooner""* or *""Damn, I’m glad I did this""*?

Either way, future-you is watching. Make them proud.

Just over 6 months ago I posted here asking whether a Korean-style idea would work in Ireland, letting people gift small café treats (coffee, cake etc.) to each other instantly. Not vouchers, not loyalty points, just a simple “thinking of you” moment kind of thing.

I decided to go ahead and build it.

Since then I’ve launched the platform with 4 local cafés around Maynooth / Leixlip, and people can now send coffee or treats to friends via a link, redeemed in-store. I took early feedback from this thread to ensure it wasn’t “isn’t this just another voucher?” to “Oh I can send a coffee to someone instantly and make it personalised”.

Some unexpected traction followed, I ended up on the Ian Dempsey Breakfast Show, and a few small local companies have started asking about using it for lightweight employee recognition (micro gifting rather than big annual vouchers).

I called it **Brontie**, loosely inspired by the Gaelic word *Bronntanas*. I’m not here to self-promote, more to get honest feedback. Have people seen similar ideas abroad that worked well? Or things that didn’t? Anything you’d change or improve if you were building this?

One bottleneck I still see is explaining the concept clearly. People ask:  
“Wait.. I buy a coffee and send a link, how does that turn into an actual coffee?”

I’m thinking the answer is better content, maybe for the Instagram, short videos showing *why* you’d send one and *how* it’s redeemed, because it’s easier to understand when you see it happen.

If you’ve used something like this before, I’d love your honest take. And if there are any café owners here, I’d be really interested in your perspective on what builds trust when onboarding something new like this.

Appreciate any thoughts, this sub helped shape the idea the first time around.",5,1767563586.0,AskIreland,7,0.86,False

I would adjust my grind settings for each bag of beans to get near the recommended 3 minutes at the final drawdown and then later adjust for taste.

  
Somewhat suddenly, a few months ago, when opening the valve at 2 minutes, the drawdown would finish around 2:30 and I seemed unable to adjust the grind size to change the final drawdown time. This has been the case across dozens of different bags of beans, and my C40 and ZP6 grinders. This happens for both my 01 and 02 size Hario filters.

  
I wondered if there was a change in the way I was pouring and I was somehow getting fewer fines in the filter, so I added swirls to the recipe, but didn't get any slowdown.

  
I wondered if I had opened new filter packages at the time that are somehow different, but I have moved onto new filter packages in the meantime, and the drawdown time is still the same.

  
I think the coffee with the faster drawdown doesn't taste as good, and it is confusing that I can't seem to have an impact on the final brew time via grind size. I often extend the immersion phase to try to make up for shorter percolation phase.

  
What are other possible causes of this? The filters might be the easiest culprit, or maybe both of my grinders got messed up and are not producing as many fines anymore.

1q42q8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/1q42q8v/ul_sleep_system_what_is_it/,UL Sleep system; what is it?,"

The term ‘sleep system’ is a popular phrase to discuss sleeping bag/quilt and a matching pad, with some interpretations adding clothing layers as well.

But to make UL gear choices perform optimally in real life the sleep system should include broader skills and attitudes like:

Site selection

Acclimatization 

Nutrition

Hydration

Mental state

Timing

..and finally..

Gear



Site selection

On popular trails with a priority on socializing site selection is often out of one’s control. But for trips of solitude on the way less traveled there are ways to improve comfort and avoid mishaps.

Compromises in the process of site selection can easily lead to fitful sleep and gear failure, so this is an important chapter.

What happens to the ground under you if it rains; are there dead trees upwind; signs of animal activity nearby, is the site lightning safe?

Will cold air pool overnight? Depending on the season this could be a pro or con. 

Exposure to wind is also a two edged sword. Strong gusts disturbs sleep and stresses shelters, while light breezes help fight condensation.

Camping at the level of lake shores and creek beds will produce heavier condensation when temps change.

Light tree cover, even just large branches overhead can help with condensation.

What constitutes ‘flat enough’ for good sleep, and does one’s interpretation of comfort balance with sound LNT practices?

When setting up a shelter will the ground hold stakes or are there nearby rocks/sturdy vegetation to support guy-outs, again with a nod to LNT?

Cowboy camps can be squeezed in practically anywhere; tents and tarps need more consideration. But is the weather/environment/mood suited for open air sleeping?

Is morning or evening sun exposure a priority?



Acclimatization 

General well being at altitude takes a few days to acquire and have an effect on sleep quality. It also takes time for the body to adjust to backpacking discomforts. 

Thus expect the first night(s) to be rough, and not a basis for rushing home and rethinking all the gear.



Nutrition/hydration

Issues with acclimatization may affect appetite. Identify a nutrition source that is appealing when feeling bad.

Fatty foods late in the day release energy slowly during the night. Accept nighttime pee interruptions so you can hydrate effectively before bed. 



Mental state

Fear and anxiety messes with sleep, obv. Know your main phobias (wildlife, aloneness, environment) and set up defenses as best as possible. 

Be prepared; gather experience then apply it and hopefully gain confidence. It takes time to be calm sleeping alone in the wilderness.

Learn to ‘embrace the suck’: discomforts and some rough times are par for the course and not indicators of total system failure. For example a slight chill after 4 am is common. Once accepted as an unavoidable norm, mild ‘epics’ will make for more impactful and educational backcountry experiences that are fun to share afterwards.



Timing

10 hours in the bag may be too much. Find ways to stay up outside to at least after sunset, then extend the time in the shelter with stretches, hydration, note taking.

Early morning hours are the coldest for rest. Maybe go get the bear canister and make coffee in bed watching the sky change. Get hiking early for some amazing trail miles right after dawn. Take a nap later.



Gear

You can’t buy yourself 100% sleep comfort, but smart gear choices are of course important. Your success may be influenced by these items:

Shelter

Pad

Pack

Quilt or bag

Sleep layers

Pillow choice

Bivy bag

VBL

The selection you need will distill over time as UL experience grows. 

Hunting for advice on the forums is more reliable than YouTube reviews or deep diving into questionable affiliate linked gear sites. 

Always apply a good dose of skepticism and analytical thinking to your purchase decisions, and don’t be afraid of forging your own way as you learn what’s actually working.

 But if UL is the focus remember that a minimum skill level pared with a dislike of roughing it might trap one in the growing market of lightweight, comfort/convenience based products. 

My current take on sleep gear is based on year round backcountry activity from Scandinavia to the Himalaya. I frequently tweak and fine tune the details. Just this holiday I spent two nights cowboy camping at moderate altitude with insane winds and a low of -10°C, and for sure learned new things. 



Shelter: the correct type have a huge impact on sleep quality. For me it needs to be draft free, roomy, bug proof and reasonably quiet when windy. My lightest version meeting these criteria is 360g.

Pad: the pinnacle of 3 season comfort for me is a 25-30mm thick torso length old school ‘self-inflatable’ pad with my pack under the legs. For four seasons I have basically the same thing but full length. If on snow I add a 9mm CCF underneath. 

Pad R-value? I leave that long and tired discussion to the folks using the newer quirky air mattresses.

Pack: my frameless pack is built with a 6mm foam back panel and a foam padded hip belt. Besides boosting carrying comfort it adds enough insulation under my legs when using a torso pad.

The quilt or bag question: another dead horse beating. In my line-up a hoodless zipper-less bag spec’ed towards similar goals as a quilt is the same weight. So while there are good reasons to go either route, saving weight is not a factor (this may not be the case with other brands). 

The main feature choices depends on the night time temps in the environments I frequent. In a size medium of a smart design 450g of quality down is good to -5°C if the *sleep system* as a whole is efficient

Sleep layers:  I wear Alpha or merino blend top and bottoms, wool socks and the hood from the top base layer. I select a bag/quilt rated so I only need to boost my warmth with rain gear or down puffy during super rare extremes

Pillow: puffy in a perfectly sized stuff sack 

Bivy Bag: not found on my Lighterpacks

VBL: I designed one that serves double duty as a pack liner. Lining my bag with this when pushing the limits is an instant morale boost ",2,1767563459.0,Ultralight,0,0.57,False

Ive been a partner for almost 4 years, never have I had any write ups or written performance issues. Untill I made a report to ethics about my manager making an inappropriate microaggressive comment about me, I get a documented coaching a week after it and NO follow up from my DM about my report. This store is unionized and I did use all the tools I had to work through it. appealed the Corrective Action, and worked on protected union activity/became involved as a result of my mistreatment from management. My first write up was in sept and the violation was about ""How We Communicate"" or Mission and Values. The next 3 months were absolute HELL from my manager. im talking EXTREME scrutiny, she would micromanage ONLY me and stand there and correct every innocuous move i do that sometimes isn't even out of standard. from sept - dec i had to watch all my coworkers actively getting treated better than me and not coached on missing standards like writing on cups, dress code, and etc. I knew partners were not getting written up for any of these things. Yet my write up was all false accusations taken out of context and shaped in a way where my manager deliberately did NOT include statements that supported me. never EVER was I issued a verbal warning at all by this manager or during this time.

Anyways, this manager would purposefully make my job harder and would only observe my performance. Partners noticed this but chose not to do anything out of fear of being management's next target. My old manager took advantage of this environment she created. it was so bad, everyday i was in an anxious state, i dont think i would have survived if not for medication. I would have quit if i found a job in time, instead, i managed to snag an interview to promote as a sav in a store outside my district. when my old manager found out i was interviewing (the system notifies the SM otherwise i would have kept it a secret). she suddenly was nice to me trying to see if i needed help with the interview process. Mind you, she hasn't spoken to me AT ALL ever since I was written up/appealing. All our interaction was me being ""coached"" by her when she'd breath under my shoulder. so i knew this was odd.

The first day I worked with her AFTER she found out I interviewed...she decided it was the perfect timing to make my job HARDER and give me a damn bottleneck during peak instead of solving them. Here's the situation, I'm at a cold bar during peak making drinks with a backed up queue. She brews a black tea back up, doesn't finish it, and tells me to finish it. mind you shes playcaller/peak support....ten minutes later im still backed up and i need that tea. i asked her politely ""hey could you finish this black tea over here"" she goes ""i told you thats for you to finish"" thats when i said ""i have drinks to make"" she then says ""im waiting on this iced coffee"" mind you she 40 years old acting like this!!! anyways, she goes in the back and cries to her ssv's. Later that week, I got looped into a Weingarten meeting and I got accused of ""yelling"" at the coffee house leader and that I laughed at her getting yelled at....mind you im absolutely speechless being asked this.

Fast forward, a day after I got exciting news my first appeal was successful! A week after that decision, I got written up for the tea incident....which was 2 weeks before I was gonna transfer/be promoted.

Fast forward now, I'm thriving in my new store and I'm with a MUCH better manager who actually thinks what my old one did was stupid. At first, my corrective action delayed my transfer and my new manager wasn't gonna take me at first but she thought I interviewed so well she wanted to give me another chance to chat in person.

to wrap this up, i appealed this second CA but lost it. My guess is it's because the witnesses who saw everything/think i didnt ""yell"" didnt give a statement. Instead, my old manager got a ssv to testify against me (this ssv got written up after i reported him to ethics...so you can imagine the mess i was in).

Currently, the corrective action is still in my record even though I quite literally did not commit any misconduct that was stated. After the delay in my promotion, the timing of these write ups, I immediately reported to ethics and compliance. Currently, they are working on my retaliation case.

right now, i dont know what else to do besides:  
\- letting the agent working on my retaliation case know about how serious my CA being ""upheld"" is. More info on corrupt management that is questionable (trust I wrote 9 pages on my retaliation report)

\- contacting my state partner relations partner?

\- regional manager? although i feel like he'll do nothing

\- is it worth chatting with my old DM about my old SM's failure to support me and etc?

but ill take any advice, honestly not afraid to take higher legal action if all fails. im hoping theres a chance if my retaliation is successfully proven in writing, it can also prove the write up was and decrease its validity. It's tricky because my old manager is abusing the benefits she has under her title including her power, policy, and disciplinary action. No one else has been targeted like me or written up for ""How We Communicate"". The moment I reported her to ethics was when I started noticing her odd behavior/ I had a target on my back. She's also known to be racist and has said ""poc's just don't interview well"" when asked why she hasn't hired more. She jokingly admitted to a partner that she ""had a type"" when hiring. I don't understand how she still has her job. I was one of the only brown adjacent partners too.

ANY advice will help 🙏 Im not afraid to stand with the truth and defend myself. Non of this would be worth it if I didn't wanna proceed with the company AND after being a partner for 4 years.

I understand the system is made to support SM's more than partners so the fact that they considered her POV to be legit and no one gave her a statement that was testifying with me is tricky. i guarantee if i never reported to ethics she would have NOT made even the second corrective action. so yeah...worked with a manager that deems me as a threat to her poor performance and therefore is insecure in her poor non-existent leadership. She is also racist enough to perceive me as someone who ""yells"" to be writing me up for just that.

I figured it was worth it to make a new friend, someone who I originally thought was interesting. They knew my financial situation and I thought I knew theirs, until one day (like a year into our friendship) they were stressed about paying for something and saying for the millionth time that they were poor. I asked, “just how poor are you?” They told me that they had $200 left in their checking account. I said “what about your savings?” and they said they had 50k saved but couldn’t touch it because “it’s savings.” Really it’s probably my fault, the signs were all there. They would drop off her laundry at the mat every week and they had a car and there’s probably some other fine details I’m forgetting about.

Anyways a couple days before they moved away from the city they asked me if I’d go to a rave with them and I tentatively said yes, but said I was tired and not sure if I could. I spent all day repotting her neglected plants in the hopes that they’d survive the move. When it came time for the rave, I just had to bail. I had work in the morning (by this point they’d quit our serving job so they could “focus on their last semester” and their dad paid her rent) and I had school earlier that day. They stormed out of my apartment.

The next morning we agreed to get coffee since it was their final day in the city. I thought we’d just laugh about the rave squabble, because who really gives a fuck? But they sat down across from me and demanded I apologize for cancelling last minute. I said, “no actually, if anyone owes me an apology it’s you.” As in you should be sorry for storming out of my apartment in a shit mood after I spent all day helping you. They proceeded to throw a full on tantrum in this instagram cafe full of swinging chairs and synthetic flowers it was so fucking embarrassing.

Anyways now they owns a successful art gallery in their hometown. Their dad owns a successful restaurant there too. We met up in Paris and they asked me if I was mad at them because we hadn’t spoken for so long and I said no. Mad wasn’t it. They’re not even interesting enough to be a bad person. They told me their poly partner punched them in the face and I pretended to care.

I notice that taking breaks helps increase its effectiveness, but that is kinda difficult since I am in school and working. However, there was one time I took a break, and I stopped feeling the effects entirely and had to bump up my dosage.

Husband originally from Indiana and lived in Tennessee for school.   I’m from St. Pete but lived in Burbank CA for 6 months in 2014.    

35F and 40M - will be working as teachers.      No kids, don’t want any but have 2 dogs that are our world.  

I don’t mind the rainy winters, since 6+ months out the year in Florida is too hot and humid to be outside for long, and bundling up in a rain jacket and going to a walk doesn’t bother me.    Plus, Florida will turn from sunshine to flooding roads in 5 minutes out of nowhere for a few months out of the year.    You literally get flood warning alerts when you’re already on the road.   

Petaluma seems to have a wonderful local artist scene (husband is a musician as well) and lots of great nature opportunities within a 15-1hr drive.    I do worry about how brown and dry it might get in the summers though.   Train access to Seattle means access to specialists I’ll need (rare genetic condition) although it take much longer for public transit than driving.  

Tacomas nature is just stunning.    Access to Seattle is pretty quick and painless for specialists.    

We don’t do much night life and usually just go to open mic nights or a coffee shop to hang, with the occasional show.    We love nature and wandering.    

What’s it like living in these places?     We’ve visited both in the winter for a few weeks to get a feel for the general vibes in the “worst” time of the year.    I did appreciate that the rain in Tacoma was generally more a drizzle vs the rain in Petaluma being a bit harder.     Petaluma definitely had more of a small town community vibe, but I also don’t think it would be hard to find community in Tacoma.     Already have a friend there and two in surrounding cities.   

I’ve already researched cost of living, job pay, taxes, cost of goods, natural disaster risks etc.      Just want to hear from others.

1q42c5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongCovid/comments/1q42c5t/suspected_covid_in_2022_still_dealing_with/,"Suspected COVID in 2022, Still Dealing With Ongoing Symptoms","I never got tested for COVID-19, but I was experiencing cold sweats and general cold-like symptoms at the time. I believe I contracted COVID-19 in February 2022 because many people around me at work were getting sick. I don’t remember all the details clearly since it has been four years.

My first noticeable symptom was a sensation of not being able to take a full breath without yawning. At the time, I was also experiencing significant bloating, hyperventilation episodes, and panic attacks without realizing what they were. I made multiple trips to the hospital and was misdiagnosed with pleurisy. I also noticed that my heart rate would spike when standing up, but doctors repeatedly told me everything was normal.

As time went on, I began experiencing increasing gastrointestinal issues. In August 2022, I developed a severe headache that I believe was a migraine, though it was never officially diagnosed. Based on my own research and comparisons to others’ experiences, the symptoms matched closely: a severe headache, tunnel vision, missing portions of my visual field, light sensitivity, and intense nausea. The most concerning symptom during this episode was a strong sensation of feeling “high” or intoxicated. I expected this feeling to resolve once the migraine passed, but instead I woke up the next day feeling the same way and have remained stuck in this sensation ever since.

This dissociated or “high” feeling tends to worsen with increased sinus pressure or excessive movement. Since then, I have also become extremely sensitive to light. Interestingly, I sometimes feel temporarily better—often about 20 minutes after eating a heavy meal, such as a burger—despite knowing this is not a healthy long-term solution.

I believe that the majority of my symptoms began or intensified in 2023, but it is difficult for me to identify exactly when each symptom started or stopped due to the sheer number of issues and the ongoing brain fog I experience. I suspect my memory problems may be related to anxiety, depression, or long COVID.

At some point in 2023, I experienced frequent episodes of low blood sugar for several months without understanding the cause. While this happens less often now, I still occasionally feel close to a blood sugar drop. The symptoms listed below have occurred either continuously or intermittently since I first became ill.

This summary reflects my best recollection of the progression and timeline of my symptoms.

⸻

Symptoms

Swollen Fingers

My fingers frequently swell and become red and blotchy. They feel stiff and larger when I bend them, and I notice the creases in my fingers more than usual. This symptom may worsen with movement or even minor physical activity.

Mucus Drainage

I experience constant mucus production and often have a stuffy nose. I need to clear my throat frequently, but it never feels fully clear. When drinking from a cup without a straw, I sometimes notice saliva stretching from the cup due to thick mucus in my throat.

Brain Fog

I have difficulty thinking clearly and problem-solving as quickly as I used to. I suspect this may be related to sinus pressure, though I am not certain.

Sinus Pressure

I feel consistent pressure between my eyes and along my eyebrows. I believe this symptom is connected to my vision problems, dissociation, and brain fog.

Sensitivity to Light

Outdoor light and driving feel excessively bright and irritating. I often wear sunglasses during the day to manage discomfort. I also experience afterimages, where outlines of objects linger in my vision.

Floaters

I have multiple visual floaters that have not gone away. One long floater has been present for at least two years.

Constipation

I am frequently constipated regardless of diet. When I do have bowel movements, stools are usually small and well-formed.

Diarrhea

I experience diarrhea occasionally, which may be triggered by certain foods, such as coffee with a large amount of milk or dairy.

Bloating

I have felt persistently bloated for the past three years. I often experience a ball of pressure under my right rib with every breath. This causes significant shortness of breath and sometimes forces me to sit upright at night to breathe more comfortably. I frequently need to yawn in order to take a full, satisfying breath.

Fatigue

I feel weak, unrested, and exhausted most of the time, regardless of how much sleep I get. Approximately 90% of the time, I feel fatigued.

Tinnitus

I experience constant ringing in my ears.

Heartburn

Nearly everything I eat causes heartburn, including drinking water.

Asthma

I believe my asthma symptoms are worsened by my heartburn.

Dissociation

I often feel drunk or high, and my balance can feel slightly off. This sensation worsens with sinus pressure and seems to be influenced by certain foods or excessive movement.

Joint Pain

I experience joint pain frequently, especially upon waking. My wrists, ankles, and knees pop often. Bending my knees for even a short time can cause soreness and discomfort when I straighten them again.

Sternum Popping

I experience popping in my sternum, which I believe may be related to inflammation of the lining, as suggested by findings from my endoscopy and colonoscopy.

Tingling in Hands and Feet

I occasionally experience tingling in my hands and feet, similar to the sensation of them “falling asleep.” This often occurs alongside swelling and is more noticeable when transitioning between hot and cold temperatures.

Memory Problems

I primarily struggle with short-term memory issues.

Severe Anxiety

My symptoms significantly contribute to my anxiety. When my anxiety worsens, many of my physical symptoms also intensify. However, I do not believe anxiety alone explains these issues, as I have previously explored and ruled that out as the sole cause.

Blood Sugar Drops

I experience episodes of low blood sugar that cause sweating and shakiness. I do not experience high blood sugar—only drops. Eating something sweet typically helps almost immediately.",2,1767562464.0,LongCovid,1,1.0,False

She reached out a couple months ago apologizing for ghosting me, explaining we needed space. We briefly caught up after some initial friction because to be honest the feelings I have for her are very profound, and it was hurting to be talking. I have since moved, and am in a new relationship, which I made clear to her and she also has a partner she told me.

Her replies eventually started taking a couple weeks to come, and the last one was Dec 20 when we made tentative plans to have a coffee when I was in town visiting.

We’re building a digital games reselling and top-up marketplace, similar to G2G and Z2U, but focused on the Middle East, where competition is significantly lower than in Western markets. ( literally 5 platforms only, and only two known good so far )

What we’re raising

* Total raise: $10,000
* Minimum investment: $1,000
* Return: 15% revenue share, calculated on gross revenue
* Cap: 3× return, then the agreement ends

This is a Royality with cap, no equity!

Current status

* We have a license from Saudi Arabia Goverment
* Platform %95 Ready, we need to link stripe as no payment gateway in Saudi Arabia is supporting digital game products ( yeah it's really weird i couldn't understand) However, also adding over 300+ products!
* copy pasting our legal pages, takes 2 mintues, we've already made them

All of the above will be completed within one week\*.\*

Early traction:

* Started as a Discord-based store 500+ members, possible customers
* Scaled into a standalone website
* 30 orders completed in 3 days ( payments were made through Paypal, which is very limited ) after that orders were closed due to thight proccesing budget.
* \~$200 in cash revenue,
* Orders were temporarily paused due to limited operating capital

Use of funds

The $10K will be used for:

* Yearly hosting plan + VPS
* Operating order flow and liquidity
* Contracts with small content creators

Budget breakdown:

* 70% — Buying products from vendors (resale inventory)
* 1% — Running operations
* 2% — Legal compliance (company setup in us)
* 27% — Paid Marketing

Why not friends, family, or saving more?

We’ve already self-funded and raised what we could internally. The remaining $5K isn’t affordable for our circle right now, and waiting longer would mean losing momentum and demand. Orders are already coming in, and we don’t want growth to stall due to cashflow constraints.

Structure & transparency

* We accept funding via Buy Me a Coffee
* A simple written agreement will be provided to protect both sides
* Full transparency on revenue and payouts
* Monthly Payment

If you’re interested comment below to send you:

* Agreement preview
* Our Licnese in Saudi Arabia
* Website Link
* Buy Me a Coffee link
* More details about marketing strategy
* Our Team
* Market pricing & opportunity

We’re turning a proven Discord store into a real brand with social media and scale, and we’re looking for a small number of early supporters to help us bridge this final gap.",1,1767562320.0,fundraiser,0,1.0,False

Crowded places, loud conversations, and constant social demands leave me completely drained, so I tend to spend most of my time in calm, quiet environments: reading in coffee shops with only a few people around, watching movies at home, listening to music through headphones on long walks, or just enjoying solitude in my room. I am hoping to find someone here who understands that need for peace and is looking for the same kind of gentle, low-pressure connection.

I am not someone who enjoys parties, clubs, or big group hangouts. Instead, I love one-on-one time that feels comfortable and unforced: sharing a quiet table at a small cafe, cooking a simple meal together and eating while talking softly, going for evening walks where we can be silent for stretches without it feeling awkward, or staying in to watch a film and discuss it afterward. I value deep, thoughtful conversations about books, dreams, fears, music, or anything that matters, but I also appreciate long periods of companionable silence.

About me: I study literature, spend a lot of time with books (mostly fiction, poetry, and some philosophy), listen to indie, folk, and lo-fi music, journal regularly, and find peace in small routines like making tea or reorganizing my bookshelf. I take time to open up and feel comfortable around new people, but once I do, I am loyal, affectionate in subtle ways, and genuinely caring. I need a lot of alone time to recharge, and I never want a partner who feels neglected by that; I hope for someone who feels the same.

I am looking for a guy (18-24) who is also introverted or highly respects introversion. Someone who is okay with texting or messaging for weeks before meeting, who prefers meaningful exchanges over constant small talk, and who wants a relationship that grows slowly and naturally. I am not interested in hookups, heavy flirting right away, or anyone who needs frequent big plans and high-energy dates.

If you also find peace in quiet moments, prefer depth over noise, and are patient enough to let something real develop at its own pace, I would love to hear from you. Please tell me a bit about yourself when you message: your age, what you are studying or doing, a favorite quiet activity, or why you relate to being introverted.

Don’t know if this is the right group to ask such question.

So I have a hard time growing in a relationship or friendship because I don’t let people come too close, and I tend to step back a bit so I don’t get too close to someone, I don’t know why I’m like that now, but it’s not something I want.

It’s like I’m afraid of people judging me, for example after church the people go in another room to sit and drink coffee and talk, one lady keeps asking me that I should come, but I keep avoiding or finding a reason not to go and go immidiately to the car and drive home, other people do also, but I think it’s a great opportunity to meet people and talk with other people.

What I think I’m afraid of is that I don’t know what to say ? Or I’m afraid to just sit there and not say anything, it’s like I feel I have to say something and it stresses me out and makes me avoid such situations.

Why is that ?

1q423z9,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1q423z9/how_to_spot_aigenerated_posts_a_comprehensive/,"How to Spot AI-Generated Posts (A Comprehensive, Objective, and Helpful Guide)","
Hello fellow Redditors,

I wanted to start a discussion around something I've been noticing lately, and I'm curious if others feel the same way. As a longtime participant in online discourse--and a human person who definitely experiences emotions--I've observed an increase in posts on tech subreddits that appear to be generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI). This raises important questions about authenticity, trust, and the karma economy.

It's not just bad writing. In fact, that's what makes it tricky. It's good writing in a way that feels slightly off. The tone is upbeat but emotionally weightless. Confident, but somehow non-committal. Like the poster is very excited to be here, but not quite sure why.

Below is a clear, structured, and easy-to-follow guide to help you identify AI-generated content. Please read carefully.

* * *

### Key Indicators a Post May Be AI-Generated

#### 1. Overly Polite or Neutral Tone

AI posts often sound opinionated while carefully avoiding emotional or professional risk. The tone is calm, agreeable, and faintly managerial--like a retro written by someone who didn't carry the pager.

Like a corporate marketing blog, these posts present conclusions without scars, tradeoffs without resentment, and lessons without a story about the outage that taught them.

* * *

#### 2. Excessive Structure

AI enjoys organization. If a post contains:

- Headings (parentheticals included)
- Subheadings
- Numbered lists
- Bullet points
- A concluding summary

…it may not have been written by someone who slammed out a post while waiting for coffee.

* * *

#### 3. Unnatural Thoroughness

AI posts often:

- Explain things nobody asked for
- Define obvious concepts
- Preemptively address counterarguments that no one has made yet

This gives the impression of helpfulness while quietly avoiding saying anything risky or personal.

* * *

#### 4. Clean Narratives That Don't Match Lived Experience

Problems are framed as journeys. Tradeoffs are presented as realizations. The messiness is abstracted away.

> ""I used to think X. Then I tried Y. Now I've learned that balance is key.""

These posts sound like a meditation guru explaining git strategies.

* * *

#### 5. Conceptual Near-Misses

AI posts often understand the vibes of a topic but get the mechanics wrong in a subtle, inhuman way.

Examples include:

- Making subtle category errors 
- Describing a system as ""stateless"" while immediately explaining how it stores state
- Using correct terminology in slightly incorrect relationships

* * *

#### 6. Unearned Enthusiasm

Every post sounds like the author discovered the topic 20 minutes ago and is now delighted to explain it to people who have been dealing with it for a decade.

> ""I recently learned that databases have tradeoffs, and wow--this really changed how I think about software!""

This energy is difficult to sustain organically.

* * *

#### 7. Patterned Phrasing

Watch for sentence constructions that do a lot of work without saying much, such as:

- ""It's not just X--it's Y""
- ""This isn't about A, it's about rethinking B""
- ""At the end of the day, it comes down to balance""
- ""X, and honestly? Y.""

These phrases are grammatically flawless and emotionally vacant.

#### 8. Forced Sign-Off

AI posts often end with a call to action and a polite farewell, which feels like the Reddit equivalent of signing your text messages.

Examples include:

- ""Curious to hear others' thoughts!""
- ""Let me know what you think in the comments below""
- ""Thanks for reading!""

A human would have simply stopped typing.

### Final Thoughts

While AI-generated posts can sound informative and well-written, they often lack the raw chaos that defines authentic human interaction. Trust your instincts. If a post feels like it was written by a calm, tireless entity with infinite patience and no childhood trauma, it might be AI.

Curious to hear others' thoughts! Let me know what you think in the comments below.

A complete life  
is not the absence of pain.  
It is pain  
that no longer runs the house.

It is waking up  
without rehearsing defenses,  
making coffee  
without scanning for threat,  
letting the morning arrive  
without proving you deserve it.

A complete life  
does not erase the past.  
It places it on a shelf  
you can reach  
without being pulled inside.

It lets memory speak  
without letting it shout.

It is knowing  
that safety is not perfection,  
that love is not intensity,  
that belonging does not require disappearance.

A complete life  
includes anger  
that moves through the body  
and leaves,  
grief that comes  
without demanding collapse,  
joy that does not need justification.

It is correcting a price.  
Saying, “That doesn’t work for me,”  
and remaining intact.

It is dancing  
without being special,  
laughing  
without being watched,  
resting  
without fear of being left behind.

A complete life  
allows ordinariness  
to be spacious,  
quiet  
to be kind,  
and stillness  
to feel like presence  
instead of danger.

It is choosing people  
who do not feed on your pain  
or borrow your nervous system,  
who meet you  
instead of managing you  
or needing to be held together by you.

A complete life  
knows the difference  
between connection and enmeshment,  
between giving and disappearing,  
between love  
and the old hunger for relief.

It is living  
without needing to be saved  
or to save anyone else.

It is being here,  
in this body,  
at this age,  
with this history,  
and discovering  
that nothing essential is missing.

This is what healing looks like  
when it is finished pretending.

Not a miracle.  
Not a victory.

A life  
that finally belongs  
to the one living it.",2,1767561825.0,ChatGPTPromptGenius,0,1.0,False

Whilst I can’t say there’s any massive changes, even just the way I think about my life is the biggest shift I’ve seen. Rather than just being miserable as I am but doing nothing but complain about it, I’m now constantly evaluating if I’m happy doing a certain thing and thinking about the kind of person I want to be. I use my phone way less than I used to, I read more, I work less at home so I can spend time with my family or doing activities that make me happy. 

The next step for me is to hopefully start waking up earlier. Mornings are always so stressful, so tiring, so anxiety ridden because I wake up at 6:45 after snoozing my alarm 3 times and then it’s a mad rush to get dressed, get my daughter dressed, pack bags, and get out the house. We already do the whole lunch prep and get as much ready the night before, yet it’s still a rush. 

Every time I have tried setting an earlier alarm to have a more productive and positive start to the day, I just ignore it. 

My ideal morning would look something like this, but it honestly feels like a utopia that I won’t ever achieve:

\- wake up

\- wash face/skincare routine

\- yoga

\- eat a healthy breakfast

\- get dressed for the day

\- get my daughter dressed

\- make coffee for the morning commute

\- leave for work

We have our ups and downs in our friendship mostly caused by her insecurities and temperament. She doesn’t have the perfect body she wants and whenever we’re together, she gets upset with me when men show interest in me. When they ask for my info she thinks they didn’t ask hers because she is “fat” (her own words). I talk to people on different topics like history, space, technology, travel… I can connect with anyone easily and make connections. She doesn’t like hanging around my other good looking(skinny) friends. She doesn’t feel comfortable group settings so when we hangout it is just us mostly. She told me many times that she wouldn’t be friends with “hot” women like me normally. I don’t try to steal spotlight from her and we definitely have different type when it comes to men. She is also not very nice. She kind of belittles people and can get aggressive easily. I diffuse the situations when I’m around. She got kicked out of a hotel after couple of hours I left her. She was suspended from private members clubs which she pays for, got into fight with most of her friends, got fired from work because of incompatibility with team members. I told her many times she needs to learn how to control this since she is the common denominator. I don’t want to vilify her since she has good qualities too but she is hard to handle. Such as I like my alone time and privacy. Sometimes I don’t want to connect with anyone and she takes it personal. So I started to let her know that I’m going to be asocial for a bit and I’ll reach out to her when I get back. Because I didn’t want to deal with her being upset about it. 

So the latest event is happened a couple of weeks ago. She blocked me since. First, we were supposed to meet and she said she is busy so I planned my night to stay at home alone. Later she got mad and yelled at me because I didn’t meet her even though she is the one who cancelled the plans. The next they I reached out to her with our morning joke like always. Later she said she was stressed with work and I accepted her excuse. After a couple of days later, I needed help to carry 4-5 luggage to my storage and asked her if she can help before my 2 pm flight. (I was moving from my Airbnb and flying overseas on the same day while working and having meetings) Previously she planned to go to a coffee shop to take her calls.But last minute she change plans to come over to my place to take her very “important” work calls without asking me. Then she tried to fit my schedule into her own schedule. And when I said it’ll not work for me she called me. She yelled at me that she is rushing to come to me and I begged her “please don’t yell at me, not today” “please don’t do this today” but she didn’t listen and I hang up on her. I texted her not to come since I have a lot to do. And she said she is ABSOLUTELY NOT COMJNG! She said that I’m at wrong here and I told her that I’m not dealing with this today. And blocked her for a couple of hours because she kept texting back to back with not very nice things. When I unblocked her a couple of hours later, I realized she blocked me. I would have at least expected from her to show a similar courtesy that I’ve shown her just a couple of days ago when she yelled at me out of nowhere for no reason.

I feel bad about what happened and her birthday is coming. But I do t like how she treats me. So AITAH for asking not to be yelled on a very stressful/busy day and hanging up the phone on her? 

I need to point out that she has this urgency or unavailability sense. She’d say oh you can come pick up your package but I have important meetings. We can go out but I have important meetings in the morning. Like everything she does feels like charity out of her “busy schedule”. I rather if she just says that she is busy and not a good time for her. I don’t like to be put in these kind of situations. ",1,1767561791.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

2. Next Predicted Opening (AI-driven).
3. Vessel Traffic (Where the tugboats actually are).

1q420ai,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1q420ai/night_shift/,Night shift,"Alright… I’m guessing you’ve got a lot of questions.
Why did I end up on the night shift?
Why is there a talking cat?
Why does the coffee here taste wrong, smell worse, and feel so thick it might as well be used motor oil?
I can’t answer two of those.
But this one I can: who would win in a fight between zombie dinosaurs and space vampires?
Ana and I have been arguing about it for several nights now. She’s convinced it would be the space vampires—advanced technology, sharp teeth, and, you know, the ability to fly. I keep rooting for the zombie dinosaurs. They don’t need oxygen, they rely on brute force, and if one of them bites a vampire… then what? Does it turn into a zombie vampire? Or do they cancel each other out?
The debate has been doing a great job distracting us from the genuinely strange things that happen here. Which, now that I think about it, is probably the whole point.
Because I have a lot of things to tell you.
One of them is why I’m dependent on a set of pills I was prescribed a while back. I won’t get into details—at least not yet—but the side effects have been… strange. Sometimes it’s hard to tell what’s real and what my mind is filling in on its own. Lights flicker when they shouldn’t. Shadows move when nothing’s there. Whispers creep into the silence of the store.
At first, I blamed exhaustion. Or the insomnia. The night shift does that to you. It messes with your internal clock, makes you clumsy, paranoid. But some things just can’t be explained away by a warning label on a prescription bottle.
That’s why I started writing all of this down.
Not as therapy. Not exactly.
More like proof that I’m not making it up.
The store has always been a strange place, no matter the shift. But nights are different. Setting aside the overworked managers and the employees who quit at an alarming rate, the real problem is what happens when no one else is around to see it.
Ana and I are among the few who’ve managed to stick it out, and even then, we’ve only just started working this shift together.
What can I tell you about Ana?
She’s bitter, quiet, and definitely not friendly. About five-foot-four, the same age as me—twenty-four—pale-skinned, with wavy hair usually tied up in a sloppy ponytail. She works more hours than she should, often pulling double shifts.
Other than that, I don’t know much about her.
She doesn’t like talking about her personal life, and honestly, I don’t blame her. Working here teaches you pretty fast that the less you share, the better you sleep… when you manage to sleep at all.
Which brings us to the big question: why am I on this shift?
Well… her previous coworker, Verónica, disappeared one night while cleaning outside.
Ana was asleep in the storage room, on an improvised bed made out of toilet paper packages. When she woke up, Vero was gone. No screams. No signs of a struggle. The only thing anyone found was a trail of strange, sticky slime leading away, as if something had dragged something—or someone—toward the nearby trees.
There was no investigation.
No open case.
Just rumors.
Five days later, Vero came back.
She didn’t say a word. She didn’t explain anything. She just walked in, left her resignation on the counter, and walked out. But she wasn’t the same. Something about her expression, the way she moved… something was off. She walked like she wasn’t entirely sure where her body ended and the rest of the world began.
No one asked questions. No one pushed.
That’s another thing about this place: whenever something truly strange happens, there’s always a convenient explanation, followed by an unspoken agreement to never bring it up again.
That’s when I started the blog.
Not because I thought anyone would believe me. Quite the opposite. I started it because writing things down made them real. Because if I kept everything in my head, sooner or later I’d start doubting everything—myself, what I see, what I hear.
Here, at least, there’s a record.
I’m not looking for answers.
I’m not looking for fame.
I’m not even trying to warn anyone.
I just want proof to exist, before someone decides this didn’t happen either.",2,1767561626.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

(sorry for length - trying to be specific)

I've had trouble getting and staying asleep since a time when only my parents can remember it. I need about 9 hours of sleep to feel good - my dad and siblings sleep a lot too. I've done two sleep studies and a nap study that found no issues except nap study found ""excessive daytime sleepiness"", which basically means after waking up and sitting bored in a lab room for 4 hours, I could fall back asleep easily, but I think that is just from a lack of stimulus and caffeine in the lab - I was drinking more coffee then and had to abstain.

I drink one cup of coffee in the morning and never after 1pm. I turn off screens and light at 10pm and am in bed by 11. Drinking probably contributes, but I went dry for \~10 months to attempt to solve the sleep issue and it only slightly improved.

I've tried vitamin B, and some methylation type supplements (my mom has a weird methylation gene and has trouble staying asleep) but it makes me feel kind of cracked out without major results - but maybe I need to dose it better? Any ideas to try? I feel like I've read every sleep book and tried a lot of supplements/behaviors. Right now, I only take fish oil and Vit D and I lapse for months with no change to sleep. Exercise is good, but only minor change with lapses to exercise. Weight and other health metrics are very good. 

Sleep consultants are like $5K-10K, so if someone suggests something and it makes a big impact, I will legit send you $100 if it significantly helps, or more if it solves it.

Edit: I’ve tried various supplements like melatonin, different types of magnesium including threonate, apigenin, glycine and theanine.  My sleep behaviors are to stop cognitive and screen based stuff before 10, to move around during the day and lift, to not spend time in my bedroom except to sleep, to meditate 10 minutes per day, to wear ear plugs and eye mask every night. I’m sure I’m missing a few things. I used to be good at getting sun every morning, but have been worse lately. This helps a bit it seems but not a game changer. I have my central heating come on at wake up time and that really helps with waking up which used to be a problem, but isn’t now. Sleeping the whole night is a bigger issue as I’ve aged. When I think it’s possible to fall asleep I will use progressive relaxation or box breathing in bed to try to help. ",4,1767561574.0,Biohackers,48,0.83,False

I have contamination OCD and I usually try not to bother other people too much with it, but some of the things my family does, I just can’t get over. Since I have a history of sometimes being clean to an unreasonable extent, i’m wondering if this is just compulsive behaviour or if my concerns are valid.

For starters, my dad sneezes every 30 minutes or so and he doesn’t cover his mouth. He openly sneezes INTO FOOD that he is preparing. I endured multiple snot coates meals this christmas.

He doesn’t wash his hands ever even after taking a dump. 

He and his new wife reheat the same food again 3+ times and leave it in room temperature for extended periods of time almost every time after reheating (like up to 10-15 hours). Even high risk foods like fish or beef.

They eat food waaay past their expiration dates and serve it to guests. And i’m not only talking a few days or weeks. No i’m talking 1-2 YEARS. This christmas I ate mustard that had been open for 1,5 years and expired 8 months ago and almost ate soy sauce that had it’s expiration in mid 2024, (but gladly checked the package before eating because i had a bad feeling). 

I understand thay some condiments can be good past their best before dates, but I feel these are so long overdue that I wouldn’t take the risk anymore. Even if they were safe, they’re no longer fresh or taste good and it’s rude to serve to anyone visiting. It’s also wasteful not to be mindful of expiration dates to this extent, which is ironic since they think i’m the wasteful one for not eating it. 

They brag about this too, my dad’s wife keeps flaunting how she ate old sushi multiple times and nothing happened. My dad also frequeantly eats fish that was cooked 1-2 weeks ago.

They keep some clean dishes basically floating in the sink, where there are also dirty, used dishes and musty, dirty water. Then they just quickly rinse them before using again, without any soap. This is the case for espresso machine portafilter or kitchen scissors for example.  If they accidentally drop something in the trash can, they don’t wash it either. The porta filter gets dropped there multiple times a day and now Their coffee tastes literally the same as what a trash can smells like.

I try to be understanding and not freak out but having to stay with them for multiple days puts me in a depressive state and i’m constantly waiting for the inevitable food poisoning. I don’t want to complain all the time so I usually just politely decline some of their foods that were not freshly made.

And the  worst part is that they think i’m being ”too dramatic” and disrespecting them, whereas I find it disrespectful to not take guests’ health into account. I know they always feel a bit hurt whenever I point something out and tell me i’m having a negative attitude in life and trying to ”worry over nothing”. Well, i just don’t want my family and myself to get horribly sick one day. 

I have volunteered to help, but they straight up refuse help on most issues since there ”is no problem”. For example i’m not allowed to put fish back in the fridge 2 hours after eating because it’s ”going to waste energy”. It weirds me out to think that to them energy is more important than health.

Btw, they’re highly educated and wealthy people who have no excuse of not knowing better. They’re well aware, they just don’t bother. Sorry for any bad english :)",1,1767561403.0,OCD,2,1.0,False

Just hoping to get your recommendations on pants you like wearing that aren’t jeans that work for stuff like grabbing coffee, hanging out at a friend’s place and other stuff where you want to be more comfortable. 

Only caveat is I live in New England so it gets pretty cold. I’m so used to wearing jeans all the time since I work in biotech so it feels weird to wear other pants outside work but I’m tired of being uncomfortable if I’m in more casual environments.

A complete life  
is not the absence of pain.  
It is pain  
that no longer runs the house.

It is waking up  
without rehearsing defenses,  
making coffee  
without scanning for threat,  
letting the morning arrive  
without proving you deserve it.

A complete life  
does not erase the past.  
It places it on a shelf  
you can reach  
without being pulled inside.

It lets memory speak  
without letting it shout.

It is knowing  
that safety is not perfection,  
that love is not intensity,  
that belonging does not require disappearance.

A complete life  
includes anger  
that moves through the body  
and leaves,  
grief that comes  
without demanding collapse,  
joy that does not need justification.

It is correcting a price.  
Saying, “That doesn’t work for me,”  
and remaining intact.

It is dancing  
without being special,  
laughing  
without being watched,  
resting  
without fear of being left behind.

A complete life  
allows ordinariness  
to be spacious,  
quiet  
to be kind,  
and stillness  
to feel like presence  
instead of danger.

It is choosing people  
who do not feed on your pain  
or borrow your nervous system,  
who meet you  
instead of managing you  
or needing to be held together by you.

A complete life  
knows the difference  
between connection and enmeshment,  
between giving and disappearing,  
between love  
and the old hunger for relief.

It is living  
without needing to be saved  
or to save anyone else.

It is being here,  
in this body,  
at this age,  
with this history,  
and discovering  
that nothing essential is missing.

This is what healing looks like  
when it is finished pretending.

Not a miracle.  
Not a victory.

A life  
that finally belongs  
to the one living it.",1,1767561081.0,ChatGPT,1,1.0,False

Before this was part of my morning ritual, I felt so tired every morning and had to rely on energy drinks or coffee.  With the smoothie, it's near immediate energy, almost euphoric!  It lifts my mood and spirits.

1q41og6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q41og6,My first winter hike 1/4/26,"I got to Elk Pen right after sunrise around 7:50 AM. It was about 20 degrees with light flurries, and seeing the sun come up over the snow covered trees really got me excit r and washed away the anxiety 

I have hiked these trails about 7 times in the summer, fall and spring, but winter is a different beast. The snow acts like a sound insulator. It was dead quiet. I mean absolutely silent. You could hear my footsteps crunching from across the lake. I even saw two deer about 200 yards away, which is rare for me here, and they just looked majestic against the white backdrop.

I was debating before I left if my new microspikes were too much for 1 or 2 inches of snow, but they turned out to be the MVP of the trip. The ascent was so fun and manageable, but the descent was sketchy and my knees were dying. I would have been sliding all over the place without them. Also, when I got to the top of the mountains the snow was abour 4""-6"" deep.

I did learn a lesson about hydration bladders though. About halfway through, I went to take a sip and the tube was frozen solid. I had to crunch the ice out to get it flowing again. Note to self for next time to blow the water back into the bladder after drinking.

My overall goal was to hike back to the Bald Rock shelter where I did my first overnight backpacking trip recently. I didn't sleep there this time, but I set up my stove where I camped and made a warm coffee and took it to sit in the sun on Black Rock Mountain. It felt great to reclaim that same camping spot in a totally different season.

The trickiest part was actually trusting the trail. There were footprints in the snow and my instinct was to just follow them. It turns out the people before me was lost too. I ended up off trail twice because I was looking at feet instead of trail markers. The Dunning Yellow to Arden Red triangle is unmarked and very confusing. Arden Surbridge in general needs to more clarity.

If you are on the fence about winter hiking, just go. The solitude is unmatched. Sitting at Island Pond looking at the flat white ice and the sunrise reflection, the quiet, the winter ciew.at the top were  moments I won't forget. I am definitely doing this again next year. I definitely leveled up my hiking skills doing this. I felt like I belonged. ",18,1767560818.0,Harriman,3,1.0,False

In sociology, your ""first place"" is your home and your ""second place"" is your work. A ""Third Place"" is the essential social anchor—the spot where you go to relax, meet friends, and feel part of a community. Historically, coffee shops, pubs, and cafes have filled this role. But in a bad economy, the ""unspoken cost of entry"" at these venues—the $7 latte or the $15 appetizer—can turn a social necessity into a financial burden.

\+2



Reclaiming the Frugal Third Place is about finding hubs where you are allowed to ""simply exist"" without being a customer. Here is how to find and utilize free community spaces to keep your social life rich while your spending stays at zero.



1. The Modern Public Library: Not Just for Silence

The biggest misconception about libraries is that they are still the ""hush-hush"" zones of the past. Today’s libraries have evolved into dynamic community living rooms.



Social Zones: Many modern libraries have designated ""green zones"" where talking and even light snacking are encouraged.



Free Programming: From board game nights and ""Maker Spaces"" (with 3D printers and sewing machines) to free film screenings and language-learning circles, the library offers organized social activity for $0.



The ""Rooftop"" Hidden Gems: Many urban libraries now feature rooftop gardens, cafes (where purchase is optional), and outdoor plazas that rival the atmosphere of high-end bars.



2. Community Centers and ""Town Halls""

Every municipality has infrastructure designed for the public that often goes underutilized.



Recreation Centers: While some have gym fees, many have open ""lounge"" areas with Wi-Fi, tables, and community bulletin boards where people gather to play cards or work on laptops.



Hobby Hubs: Check the schedule for ""Open Studio"" nights or community gardening hours. These are places where you aren't just a ""consumer""—you’re a participant.



3. The ""Storefront"" Third Place

Some private businesses operate with a ""Community First"" model where hanging out is part of the brand.



Board Game Shops: Many local game stores have ""Open Play"" nights. While they sell games, they often encourage people to bring their own and use the tables for free to build a loyal local following.



Niche Hobby Stores: Yarn shops, comic book stores, and model-building shops often have ""Sit and Stitch"" or ""Build Nights."" These are curated social experiences that cost nothing to join.



4. Public ""Atriums"" and Indoor Plazas

In larger cities, many office buildings or shopping malls are required by law to provide ""Privately Owned Public Spaces"" (POPS).



These are often indoor atriums with trees, fountains, and seating. They are climate-controlled, safe, and—by law—free to enter. They are the perfect place to meet a friend for a long chat on a rainy day without the pressure of a waiter hovering over your table.



5. How to Find Your Hub

The ""Bulletin Board"" Audit: The physical corkboard at your local grocery store or library is a goldmine for finding free hobby clubs (like birdwatching groups or walking clubs) that meet in public parks.



Neighborhood Apps: Use ""Nextdoor"" or local Facebook groups to ask: ""Is there a place nearby where I can sit and knit/code/read for two hours without having to buy coffee?""



Search ""Free Entry"": Use Google Maps to search for ""Public Plaza,"" ""Nature Center,"" or ""Botanical Garden""—many of these have free entry days or sections.



The Social ""Win""

The danger of a bad economy is social isolation. When we stop going out because we can't afford the bill, our mental health suffers. Finding a Frugal Third Place ensures that you stay connected to the ""vibe"" of your city and the warmth of your neighbors. It proves that community isn't a commodity—it’s a right.",1,1767560738.0,SurvivingUncertainty,0,1.0,False

What makes it worse is the curriculum: you’re buried under relentless, academic, quant heavy coursework that is largely useless for MBA level finance jobs and actively hurts your recruiting because you don’t have time to network, prep interviews, or do coffee chats. Meanwhile, students at better ranked programs get stronger pipelines, more employer attention, and far more flexibility, without being forced through math heavy classes that add zero value to IB recruiting. If you’re serious about finance, Tepper is not just suboptimal, it’s a handicap. Consider this a warning before you make a very expensive mistake.",3,1767560704.0,MBA,5,0.59,False

My dad ( 50M ) has been dating his girlfriend (45F) for the past 1.5 years. I (17 F) lived with my dad until a couple of months ago since my parents are divorced and at the time my mom was having a lot of mental breakdowns and was not stable mentally to take care of me at all ( I was 12 at the time) so I chose to move in with my dad. At first everything was pretty ok, until he started to get involved with some women who were not great people to say the least. I had some problems with my dads past girlfriends, not to go into details but it came to a point where one of his girlfriends daughter started to physically hurt me really bad and when I tried to talk to him about it he chose to believe I was lying and stayed with his girlfriend and started to just pretend I was not there ( since in his eyes I was “just trying to destroy his happiness and relationship”), but after a while his ex girlfriend started doing some crazy stuff to him and he eventually broke up with her. After that he started to believe that all of the things that happened to me were true but never really apologized. So safe to say that when he told me he had a new girlfriend I was kinda scared, because I always wanted my dad to be happy, find love and I was never jealous towards his relationships but he never chose the right people and would always make clear that his relationships were more important than me or my safety and healthy. As I said he started dating his now girlfriend about 1.5 years ago and at first everything was fine. She seemed like a cool person, was always nice with me and we got along really well at first, she also has two daughters (13F and 18F) who I also got along really well. Everything started to go downhill after a Trip we all took together.( To add a little context, my dad, as you guys probably imagined, would blame me for his problems a lot, every basic thing that I did became a problem, like for example the time I was cooking something and since the stove was full I had to turn of one of the eggs he was boiling to be able to cook what I wanted. It took about 5 minutes for me to make ramen and afterwards I accidentally forgot to light up his eggs again, so he got really mad and told that I was trying to manipulate the food and ruin his day because I was an unhappy manipulator ) So we took the trip and one of my dad’s girlfriend daughter’s (18F) wanted to visit a place that I did not want to go, I told him that I really did not want to go go to this place but would go anyway since I knew the daughter wanted to go. I have the worst imune system ever so I ended up having a 39 degree fever the day we where supposed to go to the place, I knew my dad would somehow twist things and be mad at me so I offered to go anyway, but since his girlfriend was kinda shocked by how sick I looked they let me stay at the hotel and rest. Everything seemed kinda of after that but no one told me anything at the time. A couple of months later we went on another trip to celebrate my dad’s birthday and here is where things start to get really messy. Right before we got to the airport me and my dad had a massive fight and I was really sad for the first 2 days of the trip. I was sleeping in the same room as my dad’s girlfriend daughter’s and all I wanted to do was to sleep, but her daughter’s would call their friends at night and they be up talking till 3 am, witch made it basically impossible for me to sleep well since my dad would make us get up at 7am to visit places. The first days they did that I just tried to ignore, so I would put my headphones on and pretend to sleep until they turned of their phones and got quiet, but after 3 days of them doing that I got really tired and told them to shut up And sleep, (I know it was not the most polite thing to say but I was super fed up and tired) the after that happened was my dad’s birthday, we went to a golf club to spend the day. At the golf club my dad and his girlfriend got into a huge fight over some texts my dad got on his phone, they both went to a place further away so me and the daughters would not listen to the fight, meanwhile we started to talk about their fight and I asked the girls what they knew about our parents relationship ( I was curious because I always knew all the bad stuff that happened in my dad’s relationship’s because he would always kind of involve me in them and never really care to hide what was happening, and by what the two girls told me they thought that their relationship never had any problems and they seemed to think that my dad was “the perfect guy”) I told them how long our parents have been together and also said that I thought that they were fighting because of my dad’s ex girlfriend who would always text him, I also told the about a incident that involved his ex girlfriend and my dad talking in front of my building and their mom walking in them talking, the two girls we’re shocked, turns out my dad and his girlfriend lied to them about the time they were together and had no idea about my dad’s ex. After about an hour of them arguing they came back and everything went back to normal, or so I thought. After the trip my dad seemed disappointed in me and would always make comments about “not talking about other people stuff”, about 2 weeks after our trip my dad and his girlfriend sat me down and had a conversation with me about what I had done to them. Basically what happened was, the daughters told their mom about what I said and asked her if my dad had ever cheated on her, they also told her about the “shut up” thing, she went up and told my dad about it. They started saying that they were disappointed, and I completely understand them being upset about this stuff, so I said sorry, said that I should not have told the daughters to shut up and that I should not have told them anything about the incident with my dad’s ex. They also told that now the image that the daughter had of my dad was completely ruined and that by doing the things I did I basically ruined the family they were trying to build, told me that apologizing was not enough and that I should show that I was not selfish and not trying to ruin my dad’s reputation and relationship by my future actions, that’s when I started to get mad because I knew that I was not completely right by they were acting like I did something far worse than what I had actually done ( my guess is that the relationship was not working out so when I messed up they just started to blame the relationship not working on me). I am not the type of person that usually fights back , I just wanted to be at peace and even though I knew that they were not supposed to be acting this way with me, I was still feeling really guilty about it so I just said I would try my best to fix things. For the next month I tried being as polite as possible with her but it seemed like neither her or my dad were satisfied with my effort to fix things. A while later things started to get a bit better and I went to a restaurant with my dad, while we were eating his girlfriend called him furious because she found out that I had blocked her from seeing my insta stories ( something I had done months back because I found out that she was was sending everything I posted to my dad even though he has total access to my social media, after finding this out I got mad and blocked her and completely forgot about it), she started calling me all types of names to my dad and he just told me I was a terrible person for doing that, that she always treated me like a daughter and I had no right to do “such a cruel thing to her”. That’s when I snapped, I told him that I was not in the wrong, that it was my social media account, told him that I was 16 ( at the time) and she is 45 she should not care that much about a sixteen yo girl blocking her on instagram, also said that I was not a terrible person or a manipulator who doesn’t care about family just because of a social media account. They were furious. I guess they were used to just blaming me for things and to also throw their anger at me and expecting me to say nothing and just apologize and regret like I always did. But this time the situation was so ridiculous that I could not just ignore and say sorry, I would not humiliate myself that way. After that a lot of things happened. Since I would not apologize my dad kept bringing the subject up and saying that I was “ruining his chances of getting a family”, he would yell at me almost every day for months about this, saying that I was selfish and that “my proud was keeping them from moving forward and being happy”. After about 5 months of constant fighting with me my dad decided that I should apologize face to face, he said that his girlfriend needed to talk to me and that I needed to hear some things, so we went to a coffee shop so then we could talk. The conversation we had that day was extremely painful for me, they both told me a lot of bad things, his girlfriend said at some point point that “ if I continued to be the way I was she could not see me having a bright future “,  after basically an hour of this I just kinda apologized because to completely honest I was tired, every single day basically my dad would make my life miserable because of me not properly apologizing, and I just wanted things to be over, so I just apologized, but it was not enough. After me apologizing at the coffee shop they continued to say that I needed to apologize, even though I had already done that, I realized that they wanted me to bag for forgiveness, they wanted me to be miserable, not to apologize since in the mean time I apologized 3 more times by text and in person, So my dad decided to not let me go to my graduation and to prohibit me from celebrating my seventeenth birthday in any way. I was really mad and sad at this so I decided to contact my mom ( who at this point was doing WAY better mentally, was attending therapy and To be honest she is a way better person than my dad she was just going through a rough fase), she was shocked when I told her what was happening and offered for me to go to her house the day of my birthday and invite some of my friends to hang out with me at the mall, so I did that. I was Really sad at my birthday because of all the stuff that was happening and because I’m that same day my dad started a fight with me because a did not respond his girlfriends text first thing in the morning, but my friend tried their best to cheer me up and I was pretty happy that I was able to do something to celebrate. After I came back from the mall I started talking to my mom about moving in with her, she said she would not force to do anything but if I felt like it’s time, her door would be open. After about two months everything kinda stayed the same, until one day my dad decided I should talk face to face with his girlfriend again, I was tired of he yelling with me about the same topic for months so I just said “ I don’t know, just thing I don’t care as much” and left, inside I was really angry so after they left I send them two audios saying everything I felt, they got really angry, came back and made me seat down at the table with them while they played the audios and yelled at me. They also sad really bad things to me but this time I just did not want to give them the satisfaction of crying or anything so I tried my best to not cry, but it seemed like they were not happy because they could not get a reaction out of me, so my dad said that I should go live with my mother since I was such a burden, so I did just that. My dad had said the same thing before but I would just stay with him, but now I was fed up, sad and angry, So I went. At first my dad was kinda shocked when he realized that I was really going to live with my mother and tried to say that “ that was not what he said”, but I knew that I would not survive or have piece if I stayed in that environment so I just stayed completely silence and left. The first 3 months he also tried acting cool and I even got to go back to his place a couple of times and sleep there, it seemed like our relationship was getting better. Than, about 3 weeks ago he tried to engage in the “you need to apologize to my girlfriend” talk, he said things like “ we are missing out on so much because of your pride” and “ try to apologize for once” ( something that as I said, I did at least 4 times over time), I just looked at him and said “I have nothing to say”, he got out of the house angry after that, a couple of minutes later he came back and said “ I think it’s best if you stop attending my house until you fix things with her. She is my family and the women I choose, I will not let she be uncomfortable while You say nothing”, I just got up, gathered my things, and left. After that I talked with him once to ask him to help me get some documents that were in his house, he said that he would not be helping me and that he would be “treating me true same way I treated him” ( since I still had the keys to the apartment I went and got the documents anyway)  he has also texted me a couple of times to say things like “ I cannot believe that you became this cold, selfish person” and even send a couple of photos of me when I was a child to say that “ now a have a bad temper” and that I should “ take care of my soul”, I have not responded to anything. So am I in the wrong for refusing to apologize to my step mother?

🧽 I clean coffee makers almost every week, sometimes several in one day. It’s part of what we do while providing cleaning services Waterford homeowners rely on. They all look fine on the outside, but when I open the lid or smell the inside, I can usually tell right away how long it’s been since the last proper cleaning. Coffee pots quietly collect oils, mineral scale, and old moisture. If you miss it, your coffee starts tasting bitter, sour, or just “off,” even when you buy good beans. I’ll walk you through how I clean a coffee pot maker the same way I do at home and for our regular clients.

✅ More about our professional cleaning services in Waterford, MI:

[https://goshineupcleaning.com/](https://goshineupcleaning.com/)

🧽 What You’ll Need Before You Start: White distilled vinegar; Clean water; Mild dish soap; A soft sponge (no rough scrub side); A small soft brush or old toothbrush; A clean, dry microfiber cloth. Do not use bleach. Do not use powdered cleaners. Do not mix vinegar with anything else.



🧽 Step-by-Step Cleaning Method: 

# Step 1: Make Sure the Machine is Completely Cool and Unplugged. 

# Step 2: Wash the Removable Parts by Hand. 

Step 3: Prepare the Vinegar Cleaning Cycle. 

# Step 4: Run a Half Brew, Then Pause. 

# Step 5: Finish the Brew Cycle. 

# Step 6: Rinse the System Thoroughly. 



# ❌Common Mistakes I See All the Time

* Using straight vinegar without water. This can damage seals over time.
* Scrubbing plastic parts with rough sponges, creating scratches that hold odor.
* Forgetting to rinse after vinegar and wondering why coffee tastes bad.
* Leaving the lid closed after brewing, trapping moisture inside.
* Using bleach to “kill mold.” Bleach damages internal parts and leaves residue.

✨Tips from GoShineUp Cleaning:

1. After every brew, leave the lid open for at least 30 minutes. Let the inside dry completely.
2. Once a week, wash the pot and basket even if they look clean. Oils are often invisible.
3. If you don’t use your coffee maker daily, empty the water reservoir. Standing water causes scale faster.
4. If coffee suddenly tastes weak or bitter, clean the machine before changing beans. The machine is often the problem.

We have scrubbed everything down in the fridge with bleach and then vinegar. and wiped most surfaces in the kitchen with vinegar and mopped everywhere else. All of the windows and doors of the house are open with fans running, but the house still reeks about 12 hours later. I know it's not going to go away instantly but is there anything else we can do to help move the process along? we are currently leaving the fridge closed with plates of water and baking soda because I read elsewhere that that can help absorb the smell, if changed frequently, and we have nowhere to open the fridge outside.
(as a side note we also have plates of ground coffee all over the kitchen as well but it's just making out kitchen smell like carcass and coffee)
(we also have a garage we could technically move the fridge too if that seems like a good idea but from what I know moving fridges can be dangerous so I don't want to risk getting crushed if I don't have too)

1q41kux,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce_Men/comments/1q41kux/posting_this_for_a_friend_just_over_2_years_post/,Posting this for a friend. Just over 2 years post divorce and his ex ended up exactly where he thought she would.,"Since my friend doesnt get on reddit im posting this story for him. We just found this out today. I dont care if its petty, im going to gloat because of all the shit I saw her put him through.

He spent 14 years married to his wife. Being friends with him meant being around her frequently. Everything I say is either from my perspective or from what hes told me.

The best way to describe her was a guilt tripper and a taker. She would do anything to make him feel like shit about the decisions he made that she didnt like. So to keep the peace he kept doing everything for her. And she would take whatever she could get from anyone but God forbid you asked her for anything in return. Hes such a good person and a huge people pleaser it makes me hate her even more for taking advantage of that.


She built a nice little laissez-faire life for herself as a stay at home mom to a single child. Looking back now it was obviously all calculated so she would never have to work again. She didnt want to work and eventually after years of him begging her to work because they struggled to get by so much, she finally admitted it. She said she would never go back to work again and was perfectly happy making little bits of side money to supplement her spending habits. He was defeated, even her parents supported her decision. They were enablers so that wasnt a surprise. He said it had already been years and he was used to doing things this way so he felt it wasnt worth the fight. He was also misinformed about his rights in divorce and thought he would lose literally everything and have to pay her 50% of his income in alimony. He said it was naive and stupid of him to believe that but it was somehow taught to him that way.

The worst part was, she didnt do anything around the house. She used her little side gigs (a total of about 5-6 hours a week) as excuses for being too tired to do anything. She always had constant excuses why she couldn't even get up off the couch to get her own drinks. I can't tell you how many times I was hanging out at their house and she asked him over a dozen times to get up and get her things. I would watch her come out of her room, walk around the couch to sit down and before even getting there ask him to get up and make her coffee. The area she just walked by. And if he didnt she would whine and complain about why its such an issue for her to get up and do it, thereby making him out to be the asshole if he doesnt.

This guy worked full time, came home from 12 hour shifts to the sink stacked 3 feet high with dishes almost every day. He did all the laundry, all the outside house work, work on the cars, and half of the cleaning. She would choose a day once a month to finally clean (according to him that meant wiping the counters, dusting a few shelves and vacuuming). When she did she would do it on his day off and make him help, and give him shit for ""letting it get to this point"".

Eventually he started standing up for himself and she lost it. Frequently. Every tiny minor argument resulted in her threatening divorce. They would eventually make up but after awhile he finally clocked out. He put on a smile and kept up with everything. And then went and saw a lawyer. She advised him what to do and he spent a year preparing. 

Then one day when she blew up at him for something and threatened divorce, he didnt fight it. He said okay. She stuck to her guns for awhile. Started acting like little miss independent. Everything she had him do for her she was proudly strutting around doing on her own. Until he got an apartment. You see, he stopped funding his 401k and opened a bank account in his name and put everything extra in there. He had plenty of money to get an apartment and buy what he needed. 

Thats when she tried backtracking. She practically begged him not to go. Because now she realized she had to actually get a job. I was so proud when he told her there was no chance of them ever reconciling. For one he already signed a year lease. She tried it again when I was helping him load up the uhaul. Dude was so looking forward to getting away I could see how good it made him feel to not feel like he was a target for her guilt trips anymore.

In the end, they opted to split without lawyers. She took the one vehicle that was paid off and the house (small house with a cheap mortgage, had almost no equity. Only 5 years into payments). She was able to get it refinanced surprisingly without a job because her dad cosigned. The kicker was CS and Alimony. He knew she was terrible with money. He had a decent paying job but he could never get his head to float above water for long before she was spending what little extra they had.

So he offered her a lump sum from his 401k. He knew he was up for a promotion in the future soon which would come with a hefty pay bump and didnt want her to come after him for more money. 

He offered her 20k initially because he gave her the house and truck and took on multiple marital debts (a few grand in credit cards) and said he would bump it to 45k as a lump sum alimony payment. She was ecstatic and jumped on it immediately. CS was 50/50 with him paying less than $600/mo which is what he said the state calculator showed (and confirmed with his lawyer).

Now its 2.5 years later and he just found out the house is already in foreclosure and she's having to move out, back into her parents most likely. Apparently, she never bothered to get a job and just sat at home using the money from the 401K. She didnt realise she had to pay taxes on it if she kept it so now she has no money left, no job, and owes the IRS over 10k (speculating because he heard that part from one of her friends).

He said he feels indifferent to the situation and im sitting here over the moon that lifesucking b**** finally got some karma her way. He is thriving, earning over 15k more than when he got divorced and is looking to buy a home for himself soon. Hes got into better shape, is more outgoing, and generally more confident. The women are practically swooning over him because hes just a genuinely good dude who has everything going for him.

Oh also his kid is moving in with him because apparently the ex has developed a serious drinking problem and she's never without a glass of wine or making mixed drinks before she passes out at night. So he'll be filing to modify CS and custody which he doubts the ex will fight him on because her parents are probably already pissed she's having to move back in at 37yrs old and the dad has his credit ruined for cosigning.

# The Versatile Brew: Is a Multi-Capsule Coffee Machine Right for You?

Tired of being locked into one type of coffee pod? A multi-capsule coffee machine promises a world of flavor, but does it deliver on its versatile brew? These machines are designed to work with a variety of capsule systems, from Nespresso and Dolce Gusto to Keurig K-Cups, offering unparalleled flexibility in your morning routine.

The primary advantage is clear: choice. No more hunting for specific pods or settling for less-than-ideal options. If you have a household with diverse coffee preferences, or you simply enjoy experimenting, a multi-capsule system can be a game-changer. It streamlines your counter space by consolidating multiple machines into one, while also potentially saving you money by allowing you to use a wider range of, often more affordable, compatible pods.

*   **Unmatched Variety:** Access to numerous brands and flavor profiles across different capsule types.
*   **Space Saving:** Consolidates multiple coffee makers into a single, convenient unit.
*   **Cost-Effective Potential:** Opens the door to using a broader, often cheaper, range of compatible pods.

We all 4 talk and discuss boundaries etc.  literally discuss everything. 

As of lately I feel a LOT of pressure from her side to let go of certain boundaries. (We literally only have 2-4 boundaries left) she often will complain to my husband about things I’m not ok with. Well she took away this or she doesn’t let me do this. All things we discussed before we began this journey. She literally told me 1.5 months ago that if I decided one week I was good and the next week I wasn’t with a boundary she would be fine. But EVERYTIME there is an issue argument disagreement whatever those things are brought up. They are things hubby and I both agreed we don’t want to let go of and my never let go of which was discussed as well.

I am planning to sit down with her over coffee and have an open discussion. I want this to go well for many reasons but the biggest is we all agreed friendships first. But my friendship with her is decaying slowly and surely. Because of a situation that occurred with broken trust, my trust in her is now gone. Looking for help with this discussion.

Also I’m not fulfilled being poly atm. I keep trying because everyone also agreed if one couple splits it’s not gonna work for the other couple for a myriad of reasons.

I'm 24, she's 23. We're both from the same country living abroad. I first noticed her at the gym about a year and a half ago. One day I ran into her outside, got her Instagram, and after barely any messages I asked her out for coffee. The date went really well, there was clear chemistry, and I assumed the interest was mutual.

After that things cooled down. I was always the one reaching out. She never ignored me but she wasn't exactly enthusiastic either, so I backed off. We kept seeing each other at the gym occasionally, followed each other on social media, liked each other's stuff here and there, but nothing more. I know she was casually seeing other people during this time, nothing serious.

About 2 weeks ago I bumped into her randomly. We grabbed coffee, she agreed to help me shop for Christmas gifts, that turned into dinner, and she ended up coming to my place to watch a movie. We were lying on my bed watching it, I put my arm around her, we cuddled, and eventually we made out for a while. She was receptive and kissed back. When I dropped her off and went for a goodbye kiss, she stopped me and said she'd rather do the cheek kiss. Then she said something like she didn't want to lead me on, and that if it's meant to happen it will.

Since then we text occasionally. She replies, the vibe is good, and when we're together we genuinely enjoy each other's company. She's told me I'm a great guy and that she feels heard around me.

The pattern is clear though. She never initiates texts or plans. But when I do, she's always down unless she's busy.

I'm looking for advice on how to approach this going forward. I'm not interested in anything serious with her, but I'd like to keep seeing her casually. How do I maintain that without overinvesting when she's not matching my effort?

TL;DR: Met a girl (23F) from my country at the gym over a year ago. Great first date, then she went passive. Recently reconnected, hung out, made out, then she said she doesn't want to give me false hope. She never initiates but always responds well when I do. Looking for advice on how to navigate this if I want to keep things casual without chasing.",1,1767560197.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False
1q41dxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/kitchenremodel/comments/1q41dxk/struggling_with_placement_of_a_few_things/,Struggling with placement of a few things.,"I am going for function first and foremost. After 25 years cooking professionally I am getting to build my dream kitchen in a month.  I am not thrilled with having the induction stove in the island but I don't see where else it can go and I struggle to see the best orientation for it.  I feel like having the induction at the end of the island will cause me to prep next to the fridge unless I am prepping a large dinner or party or baking.  So where does the garbage, recycling and compost bucket go? I am ok with separating them because the recycling has the least individual trips to that bin. 

The windows and door are getting moved so I have that to play with but I do want the door near the coffee bar for other reasons.  The path outside is in line with the new placement and I hate the current path.

Ill start with my current plan at the coffee bar and go clockwise.

The coffee bar will be my espresso machine and grinders, sink, ice machine, mini fridge of some kind cupboard drawers to store specialized glassware and drawers to hold coffee paraphernalia.  My cooking reference books in the top shelfs.  

Between the coffee bar and the knife rack/chimney is currently a doorway and that will get opened up into the living room using half the living room for the dining room.

The wall where the knife rack and cast-iron pans will go is the brick chimney/fireplace so that is the one thing that can't be moved.  The knife rack is something I designed, machined out of aluminum and had anodized.  It is completely modular and can be any shape a hexagon will allow. The mountain range look is the best I have come up with but I really want my knife rack and collection of knives on display.  As well as my cast iron pans.

  
Next to the knives I have a Rational oven and spots for the microwave, toaster oven, air fryer, vertical pan storage. Under the Rational oven I want to have a rolling half sheet bun rack.  Anything else baking related will live in this area.

across the entrance is the fridge with drawers and cupboards  with a counter/prep area/fridge landing spot along the wall. Along the adjacent wall is the outside wall. dishwasher, sink, more drawers, maybe for cutlery and plates? At the end of the counter is the backyard door and between the door and the coffee bar is a closet with two pullouts for footwear.

Next,  a pantry that is in the room behind the wall the fridge is going to be on. In the pantry will be for larger, less used appliances like a vacuum sealer, slicer, ninja creami, etc.  pullout drawers for larger pots and food items.   A 4' wide floor to ceiling set of shelves for mason jars so we can finally see all the spices and white powders I like so much at a glance.

The island is probably the most difficult part of the whole kitchen for me.  With it 38"" wide, that gives me 36"" clearance on one side  and 42"" on the other.  Which way does the induction stovetop go? I really don't like it take the whole end because I have to go over the stove to do prep on the island. I would like to go with a 36"" but I have accepted life with a 30"" stovetop.  the only thing I know I want on the island for storage is a dedicated drawer for the rice cooker and Kitchenaid stand mixer.  I am thinking maybe narrow drawers under the stovetop for oils, vinegars and the like to make it easy to use when I need a splash of something when cooking and a spot for the most used pots and pans under the stove as well.

I am open to any and all suggestions.  I feel like I am too close to the problem to see the best solutions.  pretty much anything is fair game as long as I am not shifting walls. I am already removing the one between the current dining area and living room. The rest need stay, probably.

Just invested in a Wirsh 15 bar espresso machine. I'm well aware I'm still in the budget range when it comes to machines but l've gotten some amazing espresso tuned to my taste even from a cheap 30 dollar machine before so I wasn't worried about stepping up too much more. I also am working with a tight budget.

Anyways, I also purchased a hand grinder to go with it. I've now realized that a hand grinder that has a ""fine"" setting doesn't necessarily mean it's ideal enough for a true espresso grind. I am really trying to save money and make a difference with the coffee I make at home as I once had before, but I guess this is a learning curve for me altogether.

Tried different grinds and my shots are still watery. I've filled and tamped in differently intensities and still no luck. It's still tasting like french press/regular coffee taste and 1 am starting to think it could really be the grinder. Of course it also could be the actual beans as well too.
With that being said - I wanna invest in a much better grinder but my price range for that sits closer to 50-60 bucks than the ones I am seeing. I'm totally okay with a hand grind too. After research I see that the kingrinder and Izpresso seems the most suitable for what I need but I'm having a hard time even finding a used one within the range I want to spend. I know most people will say it might be out of my budget range to get what I want but I feel like there HAS to be a model that is at least closer to the results of those grinders and definitely a step up from the basic one I got off amazon. I'm totally okay with it being used! I would just grino at Whole Foods but I'm trying to stray away from coffee brands that aren't bird friendly as I am studying to work with wildlife and study birds and so it's been important for me to make the effort to grind myself for freshness since it's hard to find a lot of these brands in store.

It's been probably about 20 years (yikes) since we've seen each other and we determined that this is the year. We're thinking about doing it somewhere in the southern portion, probably south-eastern part, but I'm kind of stuck on ideas.

For reference, we live in South Dakota and Pennsylvania. Rural/small city.

Here's what I'm looking for:

1. Dear God anything that doesn't feel like a small midwestern town. I don't want chain anything.

2. Interesting architecture that is easy to view. I am a fiend about cool buildings. LOVE them. I want to stand and look at them, not just drive by.

3. Gardens. She loves botanical gardens. (I do too, just not as much as she does.)

4. Interesting cafes to eat at. We don't need/want fine dining, but I want to feel like I'm eating something other than Applebee's. I also really love local coffee shops. (I will seek out a local coffee shop on even the smallest road trips.)

5. Very walkable. I don't know for sure if we will rent a car or take Uber/Lyft. It will largely depend on the size of the city. No one wants me driving in heavy traffic. Like, I close my eyes when my husband is driving in Chicago. I can, theoretically, handle Minneapolis level traffic, although I've never driven there myself. (I did survive driving to visit her once when she lived in Philly and that was LONG before we had voices in our phones telling us exactly where to turn.)

6. We went to college in Virginia and then I lived there for about 15 years post college so I feel no need to visit there (a nostalgic trip would be nice, but I want an adventure).

7. We aren't big party people (as if that wasn't obvious) so I don't need nightlife unless 'nightlife' means theater. (We're also both theater nerds.)

8. I love the ocean, but not being near it isn't a deal breaker.

9. I'm not really into the whole 'tour a plantation' thing. It just feels gross to me. Anything that makes owning people sound quaint & pretty is a no-go. On another occasion I wouldn't be opposed to a more learning heavy type of trip, but I think that for this particular trip I'd like to keep it light and fun.

So...with all that in mind, Charleston SC was the first place to come to mind, mainly for the architecture, arts, Low Country culture. But I want a few ideas. My husband isn't much of a traveler (and until recently we haven't been able to afford it anyway) so I want to make the best use of picking a beautiful and fun place while I don't have him with me.

1q411yt,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/1q411yt/thought_process_behind_passing_cissp_in_1st/,Thought process behind passing CISSP in 1st attempt,"`<Long post>`

I passed my CISSP yesterday ([post link](https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/1q3h6cr/passed_at_100_with_60_mins_left_1st_attempt/)) and still in that zone where my brain unloads all that I have studied since last 3-4 months. My wife is feeling more relieved than I am, today while going for a quick outing she said - she is feeling relaxed for us to not return by a certain time frame because I don't need to stick to my study time. :D 

I have failed my studies 4-5 times maybe more. 

1st time - My manager nomited me for cissp classroom training, when John Berti used to be our regular training partner; long before he founded Destination Certification. I ordered the OSG book 8E read some chapters, questioned him why I do need this training.. and why CISSP? :/ Some shuffling happened and I was off it; I was relieved. 

2nd time - I was nominated again next year, Prabh Nair (new Indian trainer on the block at that time) was our trainer. I missed last 1.5 days due to family health issues. I tried catching up but work and life always push cissp and it's syllabus in back seat. 

3rd time - Covid happened, all budget cuts from everywhere, I jumped a ship.. it had been 3-4 months in new org.. someone pinged me on LinkedIn asked me if I am interested in Amazon (some onsite opportunity). I was dumb enough to tell him, I have career goals aligned with my certification. I studied for 2-3 weeks, but wasn't serious. Supported setting up my wifes business, failed later.  


4th time - I joined a new org, finally one day; I prepared a plan I will study and pass CISSP in next 3 months.. I put up a plan.. and few days later got an email from leadership that they booked a trainer for cloud security training (CCSP syllabus) for entire global security team. 

An idea sparked in me, I ordered ccsp book, subscribed to SNT watched the videos, 300Qs, 10 chapters, 6 domains - 5 days classroom training, 600qs from pocketprep and some from wiley OSG online. Last 20 days focussed study \~80+ hours; I passed ccsp (150qs in 4 hours) before CISSP. It wasn't easy i can say that.

5th time - I was supposed to start studying in 2 months later, for some person reasons I kept skipping it. At one point in time, I think I had read 11 chapters on OSG. Anyone who read OSG can say, I was halfway there. Later a month or so; I noticed ISC2 discontinued the peace of mind voucher offer. I thought I can't take risk with 750USD. 

Final - during Sept'25 finalized plan. Started with Thor videos (37 hours at 1.5x speed), SNT videos - 60 hours (1.25x speed), pocketprep question - I was heading towards the goal. Contemplating the need for OSG latest version; I ordered 10th edition book and practice questions.. started studying that Nov mid onwards while doing other activities.. planned for mid-Dec, later planned move to pick a date later in Dec; finalized first of Jan. I had to give 200% of the commitment. So, used pomodors, ticktick for tracking time/habits uninstalled all apps (no food, no social, no insta or entertainment). from phone except office & productivity apps.

What I learned during the process was - **Commitment** & **Consistency** \- I was missing this. 

No one will come and give you this. Sometimes studying for as little as 60 mins daily gets tougher, because brain plays with us and we lose most of the times. 

If you can put 2 hours daily for 3 months (2\*30\*3 - 180 hours). You can easily pass CISSP. 

Some pass in 2 weeks. You give 10 hours a day \*14 - 140 hours - good to try. 

There's no magic pill - simply put in the hard work. Resources available today are in abudance as opposed to during 2017-18, when i first knew what cissp is.

What will work - 

1. Pick a **video / class room course** (20-40 hours long) - Study Notes and Theory - Luke Ahmed, LinkedIn Learning - Mike Chappel, Thor - Udemy, Andrew Ramdayal - Udemy, Kelly Handerhan - Cybrary, Prabh Nair - coffee shots. Everyone is slightly different in their own ways. I liked SNT.
2. Pick some practice questions (minumum **2500+**), PocketPrep, OSG, LearnzApp is enough. My scores were ranging between 65-80s. Dont' fight the explanations, understand why is this the answer.
3. **OSG book**. Studying word to word helped in not spend time on bouncers (experimental questions). I could see the question asked is really really out of the line.. or way more technical which I don't recollect reading in osg.. not the question. .the wording itself. So, make a best guess and move on. 
4. Repeat it with **tips** available on Youtube. 
5. Buy **Peace of Mind** instead of buying more expensive courses. Remember the safegaurd cost shouldn't be more than Asset value.. so cissp exam fees + 30-35% extra in prep, I think is a good budget.

As soon as you are into 60-70% of prep, book exam 3-4 weeks out and you will pass. If you work in a specific domain, some or half of the topics may not make sense technically. Just read it, watch it, ask ChatGPT or Gemini. You will be able to connect the dots.. all domains are interconnected. 

It is that simple. **DO NOT** over-complicate it. **Mile wide** & **Inch deep** still holds true. 

I wish you a good luck!

1q40z9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolidMen/comments/1q40z9f/the_psychology_of_magnetic_attraction/,The Psychology of Magnetic Attraction: Science-Based Strategies That Actually Work,"I spent way too much time consuming content about attraction and here's what actually matters. Studied everything from evolutionary psychology research to pickup artists to actual relationship science. Turns out most people are chasing the wrong things.



Society sold us this lie that attraction is 90% looks. Dating apps made it worse. Everyone's obsessing over jawlines and symmetry while completely missing what actually makes someone magnetic. The research tells a different story, the kind you won't find scrolling through filtered Instagram feeds.



\*\*Attraction is mostly about energy and behavior, not bone structure.\*\*



Study after study shows that perceived attractiveness increases dramatically based on how someone moves, speaks, and carries themselves. Dr. Robin Dunbar's research at Oxford found that personality traits account for way more variance in long term attraction than physical features. Your face matters less than you think.



\*\*Master the fundamentals of body language\*\*



Most people have terrible posture and wonder why they feel invisible. Stand up straight, pull your shoulders back, take up space. Not in an aggressive way but in a ""I belong here"" way. Amy Cuddy's research on power posing shows this literally changes your hormone levels, increases testosterone and decreases cortisol. You'll feel more confident and others will perceive you differently.



Eye contact is the cheat code nobody uses properly. Hold it slightly longer than feels comfortable. Not creepy staring, just genuine connection. Most people break eye contact way too early because they're anxious. Push through that discomfort. The book ""What Every Body Is Saying"" by former FBI agent Joe Navarro breaks down nonverbal communication in an insanely practical way. This dude spent 25 years reading people for the FBI. The section on eye behavior alone is worth the read. Best book on body language I've ever encountered, hands down.



\*\*Develop genuine interests that make you interesting\*\*



Nobody wants to date someone whose entire personality is ""I like hanging out and watching Netflix."" Cultivate actual hobbies and passions. Learn weird shit. Get obsessed with something. People are attracted to passion and competence.



When you can talk enthusiastically about things you genuinely care about, your whole face lights up differently. Your tonality changes. You become animated. That's magnetic. Doesn't matter if you're into obscure history or competitive chess or making electronic music in your bedroom. Depth is attractive.



The book ""So Good They Can't Ignore You"" by Cal Newport argues that passion follows mastery, not the other way around. Bestseller that completely changed how I think about building skills. Newport's a computer science professor at Georgetown who studied how people actually build fulfilling careers and lives. His research shows that getting really good at something creates the passion, which then makes you more attractive to be around. This will make you question everything you think you know about following your passion.



\*\*Work on your voice and communication\*\*



Your voice carries more weight than you realize. Speak from your diaphragm, not your throat. Slow down. Most people talk too fast because they're nervous. Deeper, slower speech patterns are consistently rated as more attractive across cultures.



Practice storytelling. Learn to paint pictures with words. Don't just list facts about your day, create little narratives. The podcast ""The Moth"" is full of ordinary people telling extraordinary stories. Listen to a few episodes and notice how they structure narratives, build tension, use pauses. It's basically a masterclass in captivating communication.



Stop using filler words. Record yourself talking and count how many times you say ""um"" or ""like."" It's probably horrifying. Becoming aware of it is the first step to eliminating it.



\*\*Build actual confidence through competence\*\*



Real confidence isn't faked. It comes from repeatedly doing hard things and succeeding. Or failing and surviving. Both work.



Go to the gym not because you want abs but because consistently showing up and getting stronger builds genuine self efficacy. Start that side project. Learn that skill you've been putting off. Sign up for improv classes or public speaking workshops. Anything that pushes you outside your comfort zone in a structured way.



The app Fabulous is genuinely helpful for building better habits and routines. It's based on behavioral science research from Duke University. Helps you stack small habits that compound over time. Way better than trying to overhaul your entire life overnight.



BeFreed is an AI learning app that turns books, research papers, and expert interviews into personalized podcasts tailored to your specific goals. Built by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers, it pulls from high quality sources to create adaptive learning plans based on what you want to improve. Want to work on social skills or communication? Just ask, and it generates content customized to your depth preference, from quick 10 minute summaries to detailed 40 minute deep dives. You can pick different voices too, including a deep, smoky tone or a more energetic style depending on your mood. Makes learning way more engaging during commutes or gym sessions.



\*\*Stop seeking validation and start offering value\*\*



Desperate energy is repulsive. When you're constantly seeking approval or validation from others, people can smell it. It's suffocating. Instead, flip the script. How can you make other people's lives slightly better? Be genuinely curious about others. Ask better questions. Listen more than you talk.



This isn't some manipulative tactic. When you're actually interested in people and adding value to interactions, you become someone people want to be around. That's attractive.



Read ""Models"" by Mark Manson if you want a no BS take on attraction that's actually grounded in healthy psychology. Manson argues that attraction is about vulnerability and authenticity, not tricks or tactics. The book sold over a million copies because it cuts through all the pickup artist garbage and focuses on genuine self improvement. Most honest book about dating I've read.



\*\*Take care of your mental health\*\*



Nothing kills attraction faster than being around someone who's clearly struggling but refusing to address it. Anxiety, depression, unresolved trauma, these things leak out in every interaction.



Therapy isn't just for people in crisis. Everyone should probably go. The app Ash is basically an AI relationship and mental health coach. Sounds weird but it's surprisingly useful for working through thought patterns between therapy sessions or if you can't afford regular therapy yet.



Practice mindfulness or meditation. Not because it's trendy but because it genuinely helps you become less reactive and more present. Insight Timer has thousands of free guided meditations. Start with five minutes a day.



\*\*Dress like you give a shit\*\*



You don't need designer clothes or a huge budget. You need clothes that fit properly and show you put in minimum effort. Most people wear stuff that's too baggy or too tight. Get your basics tailored if needed. Costs like twenty bucks and makes a massive difference.



Develop a consistent style that feels authentic to you. Not what magazines tell you to wear but what actually makes you feel good. People can tell when you're comfortable in your clothes versus wearing a costume.



The fundamentals, good hygiene, maintained hair, clean nails, this is bare minimum stuff that way too many people neglect. If you're skipping this you're self sabotaging before you even open your mouth.



\*\*Become comfortable with discomfort\*\*



Attractive people aren't fearless. They're just willing to act despite fear. They approach people they want to meet. They put themselves in social situations even when it's awkward. They risk rejection repeatedly.



Every time you push through that fear and survive, you become slightly more attractive. Not because your face changed but because you're carrying yourself differently. You're accumulating evidence that you can handle difficult situations.



Start small. Make eye contact with strangers. Say hi to people in elevators. Strike up conversations in coffee shops. Build up your tolerance for social risk incrementally.



The honest truth is that becoming attractive is mostly about becoming a fuller version of yourself. Not hiding your personality or pretending to be someone else, but developing your genuine qualities and presenting them confidently. Most of what makes someone magnetic happens in the space between your thoughts and your actions.",1,1767559234.0,SolidMen,0,1.0,False

I don't like writing long texts so I'll get straight to the point.

A bit about me first: I'm a guy in my mid-twenties who takes care of himself physically, appearance-wise, etc. Nothing crazy, I'm not obsessed with the gym or trying to be a model, just your average guy who looks after himself.

About a year and a half ago I noticed this girl at the gym. She's really attractive. Turns out she's from the same country as me, so we're both foreigners here. I ran into her on the street one day, asked for her Instagram, and after exchanging maybe less than 10 messages I asked her out for coffee. The date went great, almost perfect. At one point I had my hand on her leg for a while, nothing weird or pushy, so I figured the feeling was mutual.

After that we talked a bit but things cooled down. I was always the one initiating and while she never blew me off, she seemed kind of indifferent. So I let it go. We'd still see each other at the gym sometimes, followed each other on Instagram, liked each other's stories here and there, but that was it. During this time I know she was seeing other guys, nothing serious from what I could tell, just casual stuff.

Fast forward to about 2 weeks ago. I bumped into her on the street, we chatted briefly, grabbed a quick coffee, and she agreed to help me pick out some Christmas gifts for my family at the mall. We ended up having dinner together and since it was freezing outside and she wanted to watch a movie, she eventually agreed to come to my place.

While watching the movie, we were lying on the bed, I put my arm around her and we were sort of cuddling. She accepted it, responded to my gestures, but didn't initiate anything herself. We ended up making out for a decent amount of time, she was receptive and kissed back. Nothing more than that happened, which wasn't my intention anyway.

When I dropped her off and went in for a goodbye kiss, she stopped me. Said she'd rather do the two-cheek kiss, which is normal here, and added something like she didn't want to give me false hope, that if God wills it we'll end up together.

Since then I text her occasionally and she replies, sometimes fast, sometimes slower, but the vibe is good. Honestly when we're together we have a great time. She even told me that when she's with me she feels heard and that I'm a great guy.

Now, a few things I've noticed. She never initiates anything, not texting, not making plans. But when I do, she doesn't resist either, unless she has other plans or family stuff. I get that pursuing a woman is part of the game, but I'm not sure where courting ends and chasing begins. I'm not inexperienced with women, I know how to keep my self-respect and not come across as desperate. I'm serious when needed and fun when the moment calls for it. I also understand that I should be my own priority and that focusing on yourself is important, but girls aren't going to knock on my door asking to marry me. I know I have to make moves.

So here's my question: how much should I keep pursuing this? I'm being realistic here, she's not girlfriend material for me, let alone wife material. But I'd definitely like to have some fun with her. She's always been kind of my crush, and honestly the fact that she's so attractive makes me do things I've never done for any other girl. Otherwise I would've walked away a long time ago.

Bottom line, I want to be with her but I don't want to be thinking about her all the time. I know where this is realistically going and I have other priorities in life.

TL;DR: Met a girl from my country at the gym a year and a half ago, had a great first date, things fizzled because I was always initiating. Recently reconnected, spent a day together, made out at my place, but she said she doesn't want to give me false hope. She never initiates but responds well when I do. How much should I keep pursuing something casual when she's clearly not putting in the same effort?",0,1767559057.0,relationships,13,0.5,False

For reference, I am 28f, 5'5.5, 160lb (waist is 31in and hips are 44in). 

I was recently diagnosed with graves disease (hyperthyroid) which was surprising to me since I had gained about 35/40lbs between November 2023 and October of 2024. I lost 15lbs between December of 2024 and May of 2025, by tracking literally everything I ate (1300-1400 calories a day was my goal) and exercising (walking, strength training, yoga) at least 60 minutes a day. 

My starting weight was 175lb and my weight now is 160lb. After that, my weight loss plateaud. I tried to  incorporate running (which was horrible) anddddd thats when my graves disease symptoms became noticeable for me 🥲 while waiting for a diagnosis, I stopped working out (my HR was hitting 180 at rest) and then I started medications which also made me feel like a zombie. 

My doctor said there is no reason I should have gained weight with my levels (usually patients lose weight with hyperthyroidism). My doctor now wants me to lose weight (they didnt give me a goal weight, but mine is 140lb) and instructed me to cut out all starches (rice, pasta, bread...the good stuff).

Since then, I have been eating greek yogurt & fruit, cheeses, eggs, meat, and all the veggies. No soda, no fruit juice/high sugar. I have a coffee in the morning and sometimes brewed tea later on in the day, but I am focusing on water intake. 

With this new diet, I am always hungry (also a symptom of my thyroid condition but my levels are starting to go back to the normal range). I am getting back into an exercise routine (I have a desk job/WFH) by trying to walk on my lunch breaks and after dinner. I am going to start doing strength training (with my 10lb dumbells) and at home yoga too. I would love a walking pad, but unfortunately it doesnt work with my set up (but when I return to office in a few months I will have a standing desk). 

I guess my questions really are: 

Should I start counting calories again? Maybe foolish on my part - but I cannot envision I am overeating on vegetables lol certainly does not feel like I am 😭 I am mindful of how much cheese I eat since that can be higher calorie. 

I have read in the past that when weight loss plateaus, you can ""restart"" by eating higher calorie and then going back to a deficiet. I am so sure I have done this since there was a two week period where I was hungry all the time (going to sleep hungry, waking up hungry, but eating everything) but this was due to my thyroid being out of whack lol My weight has stayed the same since May of 2025 though (160lb)  

Any suggestions for starch free or things I should know about my body adjusting to no starches (if this is a thing)? 

Has anyone else here gained weight with graves disease/hyperthyroidism or lost weight with a thyroid problem? My doctor wants to take me into hypothyroidism and then hopefully to remission, so I feel like its going to be more difficult to lose weight once Im hypo.

There is also several open spaces for lease. This is where I’d like to open a business that sells, ice cream, donuts and coffee. 

The only options for ice cream is a crappy frozen yogurt chain about 2 miles away and a couple of the fast food places that offer frozen custard. The only options for donuts is the grocery stores.

*Having sunk into the realm of her thoughts, Zofia would take her eyes off the notebook resting on her lap and gaze outside, at the rows upon rows of trees making up deep, uncharted forests she was passing by. Her head leaned against the window, feeling vibrations emanating from the train, getting lost in the clutter of its countless wheels. Ah, so many uncertainties, so many doubts. She felt the weight of her family’s issues on her shoulders, even if only partially.*

*“Maybe it’s not going to be that bad?” She thought to herself, glancing for a moment at an old suitcase she placed beside herself. “But when will I get to see them again? In months?” A sigh followed, a futile attempt at dispersing worries. Soon enough her new life would begin, yet what will it bring?*

**Greetings, everyone!**

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking for someone to GM this story, I’ll contribute as much as you wish. Be it brainstorming, playing some side characters, you name it. As someone who knows how it is to GM, I wish for you to enjoy the roleplay as well (＾-＾)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

(I'd also be open to a similar roleplay inspired by ""Bride's story"" :3)

**About me:**

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Why hello! I shall introduce myself a bit, so that you also know who you’re dealing with. You may call me Frog. I’m a passionate, 18+ roleplayer from CET/GMT +1 timezone. However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don’t be deterred by that even if you’re from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don’t have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that’s worth a mention!

The [X4Y] tag does reflect the gender of my characters, not my own. I prefer not sharing it. I hope you’ll understand <3

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

**About you:**

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

Here you’ll find a few requirements, so that we are sure we match.
- *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I’ve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic ^^* 
- *Be creative! Cheesy, I know, but hey, I don’t want to be the only one coming up with the ideas. This premise has so much potential for unique and intriguing tales, let’s brainstorm them together!*
- *Be excited! Yeah, another cheesy one. Yet, I find it so fun to see an enthusiastic reply!*

I stuck with it because it was fun, kept me full, and actually helped with my hypoglycemia.

Wheat flour, salt, water, time. Lentils help. That's it.

# Whole Wheat Bread

# Overview

* **Yield:** 1  boule (a round loaf)
* **Active time:** \~30 minutes total
* **Total time:** \~24 hours (mostly unattended)

# Ingredients

* 3.5 cups whole wheat flour
* 1.5-1.75 cups water
* 2 tsp salt
* Fermentation (choose one)
   * 1/2 tsp active dry yeast
   * 1/2 cup active starter
* **Optional**: 1/2 cup dry lentils

# Steps

1. **Mix and rest**: Mix flour and water until no dry spots remain. Cover and rest 45 minutes.
2. **Add salt + yeast/starter**: Mix into the dough until fully incorporated. If you are including any enrichments (see notes), mix them in now.
3. **Warm bulk ferment**: Cover lightly (lid lightly resting on top or a dish towel) and rest at room temperature 2-3 hours, doing 2 stretch-and-folds (see notes) at the 45 and 90 minute marks.
4. **Cold bulk ferment**: Cover and refrigerate 12-16 hours. This step is flexible. You can adjust it somewhat around your schedule.
5. **Warm and shape**: Let dough sit out for an hour to warm up a little. Shape gently into a boule.
6. **Proof**: Rest 45–75 minutes, until slightly puffy.
7. **Preheat**: Preheat oven to 450 with the dutch oven inside it. Place the dough carefully on some parchment paper. It will go directly into the dutch oven on this paper, and you'll use the edges of the paper as handles, so make sure it's large enough that you can grab the sides without burning yourself against the dutch oven.
8. **Bake covered (steam)**: With a sharp knife, make a slit right across the top of the loaf, a few inches long, and maybe a quarter inch deep, at around a 45 degree angle. Place the dough in the dutch oven, still on the parchment. Cover with the lid and bake for 30 minutes.
9. **Bake uncovered (finish)**: Reduce to 425 and bake for another 10-15 minutes. If you are using a thermometer, you want the inside temp to hit 185-195.
10. **Cool and slice**: Use the parchment to lift the loaf out and place it on a cooling rack or similar. Cover with a towel and let cool for several hours until you can't feel any noticeable warmth when you touch it. If you slice it early, it may get gummy.

# Notes

* The initial hydration rest lets whole wheat flour absorb water and begin building structure on its own. That's what holds it in shape when it rises.
* Stretch-and-folds strengthen the dough without kneading, which works better for whole grains. Lightly flour a surface (I use regular white flour for this because it's dirt cheap) and put the dough on it. Grab each side and gently stretch it out a little, then fold it together. Spin it a quarter turn and repeat. That's it.
* The long cold ferment helps with flavor and reduces bitterness, but most importantly, it improves flavor and nutrition as the microbes convert simple sugars, which makes the remaining carbs digest more slowly. What's left are all of the vitamins, minerals, fiber, and healthy, complex sugars.
* Baking covered traps steam so the loaf can expand before the crust sets.
* **Important**: this doesn't have all of the preservatives and stuff in grocery store bread that keeps it shelf stable, so it **will** mold after a few days at room temperature. You can extend that by putting it in the fridge.

# Optional

Add these **with the salt** in step 2.

* **1 egg** Adds protein and makes the bread softer. It also helps with structure.
* **1 tbsp molasses** Adds minerals like iron and potassium and some flavor. Doesn't add much in the way of bad carbs.
* **1 tbsp vegetable oil or butter** Improves crumb tenderness and flavor.
* \*\*1/2 cup of lentils (dry)\*\*Rinse and boil until soft, then drain really well and mash like crazy (or blend if you have a blender). If you add these, reduce the total water by around 1/4 cup to account for the water they absorb. These add a ton of nutrition to the loaf, and the fermentation actually makes them taste really nice, nutty and vaguely like cocoa.If you grind them dry (like in a coffee grinder or blender), they'll smell grassy when mixed in. Don't worry. After the overnight cold ferment, that completely disappears and turns nutty and pleasant.

The bread bakes fine without these, but they are cheap and easy improvements if you have them on hand.

# This bread can be a meal

Whole grain, long ferment bread is not empty carbs! Grocery store bread uses all purpose flour, where all of the nutrients are basically removed to make it softer and easier to use, and adds a bunch of sugar and stuff.

You can literally eat it as a meal. I eat a few slices with butter for breakfast. I'll toast it for lunch with peanut butter. I sometimes even eat it as snacks if I have something sweet to put on top.

And I cannot stress enough how good it is toasted with butter :P

This loaf has:

* Complex carbs for sustained energy
* Substantial fiber, so it fills you up and doesn't give you a sugar crash
* Significant protein
* Vitamins, especially B1, B3, and B6
* Iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, potassium, folate

# Cost

The grocery prices are from the King Soopers nearest to my house (Colorado Springs area).

* Dutch oven ([https://www.amazon.com/far-Enameled-Stockpot-Braising-Induction/dp/B0DFW8Y6Y4/](https://www.amazon.com/far-Enameled-Stockpot-Braising-Induction/dp/B0DFW8Y6Y4/?th=1)) - \~$40 for a 4-5 quart, enameled dutch oven on amazon. This is the most expensive thing, but you only need to buy it once, and you can often find them pretty cheap at thrift stores, garage sales, and flea markets. In a pinch, any covered, oven‑safe pot with a lid that can hold in steam can work.

My back-of-the-napkin math (just the flour and lentils) comes to:

* about 5 loaves per 5 lb bag of flour ([https://coolconversion.com/cooking-weight-volume/1\~lb\~of\~whole+wheat+flour\~to\~cup](https://coolconversion.com/cooking-weight-volume/1~lb~of~whole+wheat+flour~to~cup) \- 3.75 cups per pound)
* about 4.5 loaves per 1 lb bag of lentils ([https://coolconversion.com/cooking-weight-volume/1\~lb\~of\~dry+lentils\~to\~cup](https://coolconversion.com/cooking-weight-volume/1~lb~of~dry+lentils~to~cup) \- 2.25 cups per pound)
* 3.50 + 1.50 = 5 -> about $1.00 per loaf (with the last loaf getting 1/4 cup of lentils), and each loaf is roughly 4x full meal-sized servings",11,1767558781.0,povertykitchen,9,0.83,False

I'm a socially anxious girl who has been out of luck with friendship for a long time and has a turbulent relationship with family, so I have nobody to confide in about this. When I met my now ex-boyfriend, we became best friends immediately and I moved in with him after a few months of us dating to be away from my family. This worked out great and I became an established member of his family, they were my support system. 

Our relationship, on the other hand, wasn't so great. He had a tendency to be disrespectful and judgemental in arguments, and not work much towards trying to see my side or consider my feelings. I advocated every single time across our 2 year relationship for him to work on this, even offering advice and support at each step even though he rejected the help. Additionally to this, he took me on dates once in a blue moon, would spend a lot of money on himself and reject going for even a coffee due to a lack of funds, didn't show much interest in anything i was passionate about, was ""uncomfortable"" with comforting me in even basic ways like coming to my flat to look after me (we lived separately for a ~6 months due to University) or hug me for longer than a minute without his phone. That isn't even all but I generally felt quite misunderstood/disregarded and after a lot of fighting, he agreed that it wasn't right and said he'd work on it, which I eventually discovered was him simply thinking about changing it or he often forgot, so nothing changed. But these things didn't stop me loving him with my whole heart because we got along so well other than these and the only person keeping me going, but it did break my trust down. 

I've had my own issues in our relationship because my libido is generally very low, which didn't work well for him. I've read a lot, I've tried a lot, I've asked him to work on becoming nicer because his comments about bigger women degreaded my self-esteem, as someone slightly chubby, and i struggled to fully trust him with such vulnerability. It got to a point where he was dissatisfied for around three months and he said I had to find a counsellor within a few days or we're over. Generally in that discussion, he said some really nasty things again which he took back but it caused me to have my first panic attack in years. I looked past it. We can work on it, right? He then tells me I'm not worth fighting for if I can't put out and he wants to try other people to find what he wants and then maybe come back to me. I suggest couple counselling instead as he could find out what he wants through that and he says no. Fast forward to before I can even get a session with the counsellor that he asked for originally, he decided this was enough for him. He broke up with me 4 days before my birthday and my first set of major exams.

On top of this, we currently live together full time due to a University lease which lasts for another 5+ months and he wants us to be best friends still. I've lost my support system and I'm trying to figure out how to pull myself together and handle this. I wouldn't be able to financially support myself breaking this lease and finding somewhere else as I also got fired from my job a month ago and I'm a full-time student. He's unwilling to keep fighting for us so this is my reality now. How do I move on and cope with seeing him every day?

This is two years greatly shortened so I hope it makes sense.

1q40lal,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1q40lal/sf_dead_straight_lines/,[SF] Dead Straight Lines,"Garrett learned early that straightness was a lie. In the seventies, before the tobacco stains on his fingers had become permanent - before the old skin smell, he sat in a student flat where the curtains were never fully open and argued about the shape of the world with a fellow student.

“Nothing’s truly straight,” Simon said, voice flattened by smoke. “You draw, you zoom in, and there are burrs. A laser? Dust and air make it dance.” He traced an imaginary ruler-line in the air and bumped it gently with his knuckle. Garrett watched the gesture as if a priest had lifted a wafer.

He had laughed because that is what you do in a conversation like that, but something in him took hold. The idea was stupid and trivial and therefore perfect - a private dare. Find a dead straight line. Not Euclid on a chalkboard, not a line that is a line until you look closely. He wanted a line that would not flinch under zoom. A line that, if brought to the eye of God, would embarrass the Almighty for having nothing to correct.

An obsession began - and he became irritable, difficult; Simon called him “tally marks” because he counted small betrayals like not replacing yogurts in the fridge. He learned how to end a conversation by looking at a clock that was not there. It worked. At twenty-two, he had mastered emptying a room by simply being present.

In the microscopy lab he borrowed time he was not supposed to have, penciling lines on acetate with a ruler, dragging a blade down the acetate to see how plastic healed. Under the scope the graphite edges were a chewed coastline. At the highest magnification the jaggedness became landscape - stalagmites, craters and pine forests. He felt both thrilled and insulted. The insult was important. It brazed the obsession permanently onto him.

He became a microbiologist. The bacteria were obedient. You kept them at 37°C, fed them sugar water and they reproduced happily without ever asking what you thought of them. He wrote papers about plasmids, about efflux pumps, about resistance patterns in hospital sinks. The work was fine, accurate, useful; it kept him indoors and away from people.

Everyone in the department had their private research, their corner of the map they believed was the only place that mattered. Garrett’s map had a cliff at its edge. Beyond it: geometry not taught to undergraduates and forums with names he would not share with colleagues. He read about Brownian motion, about thermal noise in lattices, about how even a crystal - that symbol of order - ripples at its edges at any temperature above zero. He read about beam bending, about the Euler–Bernoulli equation, about residual stress along an edge where the polishing was poor.

He kept notebooks that were more catalogue than diary. Entries were dated and cross-referenced. He never wrote the names of people, he wrote their job titles, their experiments. “Tech in Cell Culture: breath smells of coffee,” one line reads, then an arrow into a diagram of a light path.

The students who drifted through his lectures saw only the brittle professor who did not tolerate guesses. He cut them off with a smile that was not friendly and corrected their pronouns when they used “we” to include him in their imagined cohort. “You,” he would bellow. He watched them flinch, and in the flinch felt a tic of joy.

He had one attempt at something like a marriage, with Hannah the librarian. She wanted a dining table and he wanted a bench. She wanted a holiday and he wanted a stable power supply for the servo system he was building in the spare room. The night she asked if he loved her he answered two minutes too late, and in those two minutes the thing they had built together had sprung a leak and gone down like a cheap inflatable on arctic waters. She left behind a mug, a scarf and a tiny brown paint spot on the tobacco-white wall above the headboard. He kept the spot, touching it as he fell asleep, as if it were a button that could return him to some earlier configuration. It never did.

He built the machine with grant leftovers some of his own money and a useful lathe left to him by his father. The lab technicians learned to ignore the deliveries; vacuum pumps, a stainless steel chamber that looked like a coffin, steel rails and ultra smooth bearings. The blade was the part he treated as if it were alive. He worked the steel into an fine edge, he dressed it with powders, with diamond slurry and with the occasional ritual.

The machine was three nested systems. First, the chamber: a low-pressure box evacuated by a pair of pumps, one rotary, one turbo. Inside the chamber a gimbal held the blade. The gimbal sat on piezoelectric actuators that could move the blade a few microns at a time in any direction. The motor that swung the blade was an old friend he fed perfectly regulated current. The second system: sensors. Laser vibrometers mapped the tremble of the world; interferometers measured how the blade wandered from its assigned path. The third system was a feedback loop that learned the room’s rhythms. He wrote code at night that predict effects on the building when a lorry went by and the microseism of the sea a hundred kilometres away. He taught the machine to love stillness.

He swung the blade at different speeds and angles, sometimes slicing paper taped to a frame, other times cutting smoke from a mineral oil generator. He watched the footage slowed to twenty thousand frames per second. Alone in the lab, he sang to the machine. Not songs from his childhood, those he could not bear, but monotone recitations of notes and calculations. He could stand himself for hours at a time if he kept the voice down to a hum, just one more parameter that could be filtered out. He became good at filtering. He filtered hunger, guilt, his memories.

On the day he made the cut he had already failed twice. He was good at failure now. He recorded it with the neutrality of a coroner. “Run 3127: minor bow observed under 4500 rpm; adjustment +0.2 mrad not sufficient.” He would replay the footage and draw the deviation on a transparent overlay.

On his third experiment of the day he heard a sound like a snapped violin string and a clatter inside the chamber. The mount had slipped. Not far, not catastrophically, but enough. He swore aloud, a neat private litany. He swore again, uglier. Something in him rose - a pressure he had put off for forty years. He unlocked the chamber, killed the pumps and opened the lid. He lifted the blade from its housing and felt its weight fully in his left arm.

No living person would have recognised the sound that came out of him as human. He swung the blade as if cutting down a hanging rope. The arc shattered glassware and sent a row of test tubes to the ground. He swung again at nothing. The third swing entered the air with a speed he would usually never risk, his muscles translating forty years of measured restraint into a single gesture. The motion cut a line.

What opened was not theatrical. It had no spokes of divine machinery. Around the slit, the room went wrong. The bench and the floor seemed to tilt toward it and away from it at the same time, like the slit were covered with a lens with a perverse focal length. The line he had drawn was “right”. Not “close.” Not “good enough for publication.” Perfect straightness existed.

He stepped toward it. Beyond, he could not see a world and yet knew there was one. The colour resembled hospital strobe lighting. He raised his hand, not to touch, just to measure. As his fingers drew close to the fluorescence, something from the other side met him. It was not a hand, not really. It made contact the way treacle contacts a spoon. The viscous mass gripped his arm and rolled over his shoulder to the back of his head, then the mass caressed his temples, as if scanning his the inside of his skull.

Garrett was not a sturdy man. The mass squeezed and his skull gave way with little resistance. Pain tore him through. He heard a sound from inside him like a wet mop slapped to a tiled floor. The mass released and he fell forward. The laboratory did what rooms do when no one is in them: it settled. The monitors ran out of buffer and stopped recording. The vacuum pumps were off. The slit healed.

People would talk, of course. A cleaner would find him and say something about “one of the professors” and remember some encounter, inaccurately. A committee would meet and draft a gentle announcement. The head of department would refute quietly any rumours with the words “tragic accident.” Simon would buy two tequilas and say, “He was always . . . intense,” and leave “awful” unsaid.

1q40i81,https://www.reddit.com/r/NicotineFreeLifestyle/comments/1q40i81/quitting_nicotine_isnt_just_about_willpowerits/,Quitting Nicotine Isn't Just About Willpower—It's About Knowing Your Loop,"A lot of people say **""know yourself""** when it comes to quitting nicotine. And yeah, that matters—but it's not the full picture.

Here's what actually works.

## What ""knowing yourself"" really means

Nicotine isn't just a chemical addiction. It becomes wired into your daily patterns:

**Triggers** – Coffee. Driving. After meals. Stress. Boredom.

**Emotions** – Anxiety. Anger. Loneliness. Even excitement.

**Identity** – ""I'm a smoker."" ""I need it to focus."" ""It's my break.""

**Rewards** – Dopamine relief. The ritual. Permission to pause.

So ""knowing yourself"" means **knowing your loop**:

**Trigger → Craving → Behavior → Relief/Reward**

If you can name your loop, you can interrupt it.

## The part that ISN'T just self-knowledge

Even if you understand yourself perfectly, nicotine still causes:

- **Withdrawal cycles** that hit in waves
- **Conditioned cues** (your brain learned: coffee = nicotine)
- **Automatic habits** (hand-to-mouth, the ""break"" ritual)

That's why quitting also needs **systems**, not just insight:

- Pre-decided substitutions (water, gum, a walk, box breathing)
- Environment changes (remove access, avoid trigger-stacking early on)
- A short script for cravings: *""Not negotiating. This is a wave.""*
- A recovery plan for sleep, food, and stress management

## A simple way to combine both

Ask yourself these 3 questions—they cover about 80% of relapse causes:

1. **When do I crave most?** (time/place/activity)
2. **What am I trying to change or escape in that moment?** (stress, fatigue, boredom, social pressure)
3. **What micro-reward am I actually seeking?** (calm, focus, stimulation, a break)

Then build a replacement that gives you the same reward—without nicotine.


**Example:**

*Trigger:* Morning coffee  
*Escape:* slow/not fully awake 
*Reward:* Alertness + ritual

*Replacement:* Cold water + 2-minute walk + deep breathing while the coffee brews

1q40i7a,https://i.redd.it/jhu1k1071ebg1.png,2025 cashflow sankey,"I don't use Monarch with as much aptitude as other folks on here so please be a bit kind ;). For me, it's more for tracking spending and income then it is about making every category happy month over month. In any case, here it is for this year. A few notes and caveats. 

* Bay area, late 30s, W2 income is \~$350k but a lot of that is in stock based compensation, both RSUs and ESPPs. Some of these get held, some of these get sold. They're pretty volatile and distort my 'earning' or 'saving' a lot so I don't link these accounts to Monarch but track separately. Monarch just takes in my take home paycheck
* I have a few categories that just get excluded from here like tax spending
* For 2026 I'll start tracking my HSA and retirement accounts here though. 
* Hoping for a Q1/Q2 promotion to get me to \~$550k annualized W2 for 2026. Actual income would be subject to when promo occurs, exact terms, and general market fluctuations 
* No debt
* A few of my recurring expenses keep going up and I'm considering canceling or moving. Insurance for January 2026 came in at $315/mo! It's thru state farm, open to any other options
   * Single car with \~$20k of value that's about $170
   * An umbrella policy of $3M that's $110
   * Renters insurance of $35
* Internet/Cell phone are with Comcast + Xfinity for $85/mo for internet, $65/mo for the phone (I own the phone). That's not horrible but I feel like it could be better
* Bike expenses were because I bought a new one in 2025, should be cheaper in 2026
   * This and transit are my main commuting options which is why gas is so low.
* I try to stick to a rule of thumb of $100/week on eating out. I went a bit over that this year so will work to reign it in
* Car maintenance and travel will go down a bit for 2026
* Clothing may go up as my wardrobe is quite old and I need a few items
* Concert spending gives me some of my best memories, and this year while it was a bit high it included some really special ones

Overall, moving \~12% of my take home, non stock based income to cash savings is not bad and I've done a decent job of controlling expenses. I'm targeting to increase that to 15% with some reductions in spending in key areas, with full knowledge there could be some growth to other areas or surprises due to inflation. The promotion would help blow it up a lot as a big component of the raise would be to salary. I'm also generally pretty frugal and happy when I spend money on myself to 'buy back time' (ie started doing that this year) or make my life easier.

Happy to hear any suggestions on spending, saving, how to use Monarch better, or somewhere I can spend more to make my life easier.",0,1767558153.0,MonarchMoney,6,0.35,False

When I will have weekends and holidays banked I plan to visit the country  
\- What should I visit there? (Already went to dubrovnik but I'm not a big fan of tourists crowded places, like Zadar and Split too I suppose, more looking for hidden and authentic places)  
\- I really love learning new languages and aim to properly learn & speak croatian during my time here, I will have language courses but do you know any website or free online ressources I could use alongside?  
\- I also love to adapt to the local ""routine"", what are the usual meal times, coffee time, sleep time etc... on paper  
\- Are bus/trains enough to travel the country? Is hitchhiking common?  
\- Do you usually tip in restaurants/bar? How much?  
\- Do you have any other cultural thing I should try? I know footbal is huge there so I'll try to watch a match at least, but do you have anything other in mind?
