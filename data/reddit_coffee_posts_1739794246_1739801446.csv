Some days, the siren call of the snooze button is simply too much. And we inevitably oversleep thanks to the complacency that comes woth our civilian jobs and not needing to he 15 minutes early to the 15 minutes early every day. 

I FOUND A SOLUTION!

That said, if you don't sleep alone, your partner better be an early.riser because they will stable you if you bring my solution into a communal sleeping space... 

It's called the Sonic Bomb Alarm clock. Sucker is meant for deaf, blind and otherwise disabled folks. It'll screech anywhere between totally silent, and 90 decibels in a desperate attempt at waking your dozy ass up. 

At the same time, It'll flash bright white lights, and cause your entire bed to vibrate. 

It's those last two things that are what make it... You can turn the unholy screeching off and just have it vibrate and blink. The actual means to turn it off, is small and somewhat hidden. Requiring manual dexterity that comes with wakefulness to shut it up...  Any other actions will simply act as a 5 minute snooze, where it will again begin vibrating, blinking, and screeching. 

I have not been late for anything since I picked it up. Nor have I overslept even once unless I had literally been awake for several days with no sleep. 

And... while I have been shaved, showed, fed, watered, and caffeineated before being out the door by 5am, the rest of my housemates with their civilian concerns and schedules have been irritation free and oblivious to my furious but otherwise silent activities.  

The peace that this stupid clock has purchased me has been immeasurable. It's effectiveness is such that I bring it on business trips. They're like $50 on Amazon and worth every frickin' penny. 

Oh, they also sell extensions to the chord on the vibrating thingie, so if you're like me and attempt to violently assault the clock out of reflex, you can make it so you're forced to get your ass out of bed and walk to wherever it has been posted up. 

Never be late again. Feel free to let your performance do the disappointing for you!

I'll take the strongest coffee you have, the strongest candy flavored vape, and three packs of that energy gum. I woke up at 3, but went to bed at 2. That shit is what's gonna get me through the day... ",0,1739801038.0,army,1,0.33,False

1irkewx,https://www.reddit.com/r/chuckklostermAIn/comments/1irkewx/the_gospel_of_multiplicity_how_three_screens_can/,The Gospel of Multiplicity: How Three Screens Can Make One Man Feel Like God,"Every time I see a guy with multiple monitors, I assume he‚Äôs either saving the world or watching six consecutive episodes of¬†*The Office*. There‚Äôs no middle ground. The modern home office‚Äîa cathedral of backlit panels, tangled HDMI cords, and a chair that probably cost more than his first car‚Äîis less a workspace than a stage. The performance? Competence. The audience? Himself. And yet, the show must go on, even if the only viewer is a half-empty LaCroix can sweating onto a mousepad shaped like a vintage Nintendo controller.

Let‚Äôs be clear: No one¬†*needs*¬†three monitors. You could pilot a 747 with fewer screens. But here we are, in an era where the number of displays flanking a man‚Äôs skull directly correlates to his perceived gravitational pull in the universe. The justification is always pragmatic, of course. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs for efficiency,‚Äù he‚Äôll say, as if alt-tabbing between Excel and Slack were the cognitive equivalent of defusing a bomb. ‚ÄúI code on the vertical one,‚Äù he‚Äôll add, gesturing to a monitor rotated 90 degrees like a cryptic monument to his own focus. But strip away the utility, and what remains is pure theater. The triple-screen setup is the adult version of a toddler insisting they can‚Äôt sleep without a specific stuffed animal‚Äîexcept the stuffed animal is a 27-inch IPS panel with a 144Hz refresh rate.

What‚Äôs fascinating isn‚Äôt the hardware itself, but the mythology it sustains. These men (and they are almost always men) have internalized a quiet, unshakable belief: The more screens you command, the more you matter. It‚Äôs a kind of digital phrenology. Two monitors? You‚Äôre a functional member of society. Three? You‚Äôre a cybernetic overlord. Four? You‚Äôre either editing¬†*Avatar 3*¬†or you‚Äôve mistaken your desk for the bridge of the Starship Enterprise. The irony is that the actual work happening across these panes of glass is often indistinguishable from what could be done on a single laptop in a coffee shop. But the coffee shop lacks the crucial element: witnesses. At home, the only witness is the webcam, and it‚Äôs perpetually off.

The psychology here is recursive. The screens exist to validate the work, and the work exists to validate the screens. It‚Äôs a perfectly closed loop, like a snake eating its own tail while listening to a Joe Rogan podcast. Consider the ritual: Each morning, our hero boots up his arsenal, each monitor flickering to life in a sequence that feels vaguely ceremonial. The left screen hosts the emails‚Äîa scrolling ticker tape of other people‚Äôs demands. The center screen glows with the holy text of his craft: lines of code, a spreadsheet, maybe a muted Zoom call where someone‚Äôs dog is barking. The right screen? That‚Äôs the id zone. Twitter. Reddit. A pirated stream of¬†*Succession*. The triune setup mirrors the Holy Trinity, if the Holy Trinity were composed of Productivity, Procrastination, and the Persistent Delusion That Multitasking Is a Real Thing.

But here‚Äôs the twist: The more screens you add, the less you see. The human eye can only focus on one thing at a time, which means 80 percent of this real estate exists peripherally, humming with the existential dread of unread Slack threads and unclosed Chrome tabs. It‚Äôs the digital equivalent of buying a bigger house just to store the boxes you‚Äôll never unpack. And yet, the allure is undeniable. There‚Äôs a reason these setups proliferate in an age where ‚Äúdeep work‚Äù is a bestseller and attention spans are measured in TikTok seconds. The monitors are not tools. They‚Äôre talismans. They‚Äôre a way to broadcast, to yourself and the empty room, that you are a person who¬†*handles things*‚Äîeven if those ‚Äúthings‚Äù are just a rotating carousel of distractions you‚Äôve mistaken for priorities.

The most telling detail is what happens when the workday ends. Power down the screens, and the room becomes a tomb. The monitors, now dark, reflect the silhouette of a man who just spent 10 hours convincing himself that productivity is a geometric function. He‚Äôll tell his partner he ‚Äúcrushed it‚Äù today. He did not. He moved pixels from one place to another. He attended a meeting that could‚Äôve been an email. He wrote code that will be obsolete in six months. But none of that matters. What matters is the illusion of magnitude, the sensation of controlling a vast, blinking kingdom‚Äîeven if the kingdom‚Äôs borders end at his IKEA desk.

In the end, the multiple-monitor guy is neither a genius nor a fraud. He‚Äôs just a modern Sisyphus, forever rolling his boulder of open tabs up a mountain of self-imposed expectations. The screens aren‚Äôt the problem. They‚Äôre the solution. Because as long as he‚Äôs surrounded by them, he can keep pretending that the boulder is a throne.",1,1739800689.0,chuckklostermAIn,1,1.0,False

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning, possible triggers! ‚ö†Ô∏è
Hello everyone, 19 (F) I want to warn you in advance that I am not from the USA, so there may be translation inaccuracies. 

At the age of 16, I started losing weight from ## kg  with a height of 166 cm. At first everything went well, but then I began to severely limit myself, to be afraid of food, to eat only low-calorie foods, drink a lot of hot coffee and tea instead of food, chew gum, etc., not allowing myself to eat and do a lot of strange things ...

In general, I lost weight to ## kg and lost my period for a long time At that time, I had black circles under my eyes, my hair was falling out, I had lanugo, I had a low pulse and low blood pressure, it was hard for me to climb the stairs and I almost fainted. I had burned out a lot of muscles and I was very weak... And many other consequences...

And the worst part is that I began to experience very frequent, intense hunger, but I did not allow myself to eat. I was looking at the clock and waiting for the damn time to eat my small, low-calorie portion of chicken breast and vegetables...

Those were terrible times. In August 2022, my mother and I went on a trip to another city, to a hotel, and I took a scale with me to weigh food. But it didn't really help... EXTREME HUNGER caught up with me there! I was eating and couldn't stop... The hunger was so strong that I filled my stomach with food, but the hunger did not go away, despite the fact that my stomach was full. It's incredibly scary and bad. I ate, but I couldn't get enough... And I realized: this is the end. I'll gain fat! That was the scariest thing for me, and it happened. 

Upon arrival home, I began to SEVERELY overeat ####-##### calories. Especially nuts, peanut butter, white bread, bananas and honey.
I gained a lot of weight... After a while, now I weigh ## kg. Yes... And I started having binge eating... because of hunger. I gained a lot of weight and I keep gaining it.

And the main reason for my anxiety and all this... An incessant STRONG feeling of hunger in the throat and mouth between meals! Not in the stomach. Namely, in the mouth and throat. It TORMENTS me EVERY DAY! It's a terrible feeling... I can't take it anymore. It's just unbearable. A pulling, strong, insane feeling of hunger! Not letting me live. 

I can't leave the house for a long time, I always need FOOD with me. I feel like I'm going to die from this feeling of hunger for a short while without eating. One time it was SO UNBEARABLE that I cried from this feeling of hunger tearing at me. I needed food here and now. It's beyond words, friends...

Although I have already recovered physically. (but not psychologically) 
My body gained a LOT of fat (and yes, I hate my body, it regained big hips and buttocks) 
But this hunger... It doesn't stop. I eat enough protein, fat, carbohydrates, and fiber. But I overeat every day up to #### kcal mainly from nuts and sweet fruits. I gain fat every day and I hate it! 

I recently went to an endocrinologist... And they gave me a bunch of tests. Blood glucose is normal, leptin is quite normal, everything else is fine too. My stomach is fine, almost. 
I'm going to see this doctor soon. It seems to me that something has gone wrong at the hypothalamic level, most likely... I've told other doctors this, but NO ONE could figure out why I feel hungry in my mouth and throat. This is strange. I got this feeling after anorexia. 

I struggle with this every day... And my old ""life hacks"" like hot tea and coffee are no longer helping. ME. NEED. FOOD! And only after I fill my stomach does this unbearably strong, pulling feeling in my mouth and throat go away. For a while. For two hours or less. And this strong feeling of hunger comes back again.

I‚Äôve officially completed my first half marathon! A huge thanks to this community‚ÄîI‚Äôve asked way too many questions, so it‚Äôs only fair I give back with a race report. I‚Äôd also love to hear any advice on how to improve moving forward!

### Training

25F. I signed up for this race last May before I even started running. I was already active, so I wasn‚Äôt starting from zero, but I‚Äôm a stubborn perfectionist‚Äîjust finishing wasn‚Äôt an option.

I began running in August with a 10K block, then started a half marathon plan with Runna in late October. At first, training felt great. I was running 40-50km per week and handled workouts well. I even hit 19:50 in a 5K tune-up in November.

Then December happened. The plan got aggressive‚Äîsuddenly ramping up to 70km/week while increasing workout intensity. I tried to push through, but it led to burnout. I was exhausted, unmotivated, and struggling to hit paces. In hindsight, increasing both volume and intensity at the same time was a mistake.

After some advice from this forum, I switched to a looser structure based on Daniels‚Äô Running Formula from January onward:

2 easy runs
1 interval session (e.g., 5√ó1K w/ 3-min jogs)
1 threshold session (e.g., 3√ó2 miles)
1 long run (usually easy)
The last five weeks before taper, I averaged 80-85km per week and finally adapted. A 10K time trial four weeks out (41:00) gave me confidence to aim for 1:30 finish time.


### Pre-race

I arrived in Barcelona on Wednesday and might have overdone the sightseeing‚Äîlots of walking Thursday and Friday. I felt fine but probably should have taken it easier. Saturday, I kept movement to a minimum except for a short shakeout run.

Race morning? A mess. Alarm at 5:30 AM, barely slept. I usually train late mornings, so the 8:30 AM start felt rough. Breakfast was porridge at 6 AM, two Starbucks bottled coffees (probably a bad call), and a banana 30 minutes pre-race.

### Race

The conditions were perfect‚Äîgreat weather, amazing crowd support. The start was a bit chaotic (lots of people ignoring their assigned waves), but I settled in quickly. My heart rate locked into 177-178 BPM by km 2 and stayed there (zone 4‚Äîgood, I think?).

The first 7-8K felt smooth and controlled. I was pacing well for 1:30. Then, at km 10, the happy joyful feelings went away‚Äîstomach cramps and nausea. They didn‚Äôt go away. At one point, I thought I‚Äôd have to stop. I took two gels (km 7 and km 15), which I had practiced in training, but something felt off. Maybe the coffee? Maybe my IBS? Either way, it sucked.

From km 15 onward, it was a grind. My legs burned‚Äîis that normal, or does it improve with more training? I had to focus on my breathing to keep moving. I slowed down slightly but pushed through at km 20‚Äîthere was no way I was giving up that close to the finish.

Crossing the line, I had no idea what my time was. Seeing 1:29:xx on the results made me so happy‚ÄîI actually did it!

### Post-race

At first, I was just thrilled to be done and proud of the result. Running my first half on the same course as a world record felt surreal.

Then‚Ä¶ my inner perfectionist kicked in. Could I have pushed harder? Should I have fought the slowdown? I hate that I struggle to be satisfied with my achievements, but I know I should be proud of this.

Next steps: a down week (left calf is super tight), then deciding on my focus. My first marathon is in December, so I‚Äôll aim to maintain 80-90km per week until proper training begins. I‚Äôm also tempted to chase sub-40 for 10K and fit in another half before Valencia.

If you made it this far‚Äîthank you for reading! Open to any feedback, suggestions, or reality checks. Always looking to improve!",6,1739799818.0,AdvancedRunning,0,1.0,False

Then chat¬≤ nami, then transferred sa ig, padayon ra amo talk. And then pila ka months of talking we decided to meet. Taga cdo sila before pero namalhin na sila (di na nako i mention ang place where) so nagtravel sya pa CDO to meet me. Nag meet mi SM downtown and waited him like for 1 hr na ata because of the effin traffic. Naga vc naman mi pero I was kinda disappointed when I met him in person. Sa looks okay raman for me pero di jd siya like kuan kanang type nako , saks lang but sa height lang ko na off. I'm a tall girl man gud and ganahan kog guy nga mas taas jud nako. So nag tuyok¬≤ ra mi sa mall, tabi, he is tabian same sa chat and wa ra kayko nakafeel ug awkward and mga after 1hr ata nakig uli nako ky need nasab nako mu uli and need na sa niya mubyahe. Mag coffee unta mi pero puno man ang kapehan sa SM ato nga time, wa nalang.


After that meet up, I was planning to ghost him. I was like ""hmmmmm this isn't going to work out man oy, he's not my type"" then realized ""as if uyabon nimo sya oy? Naunsa diay ka?"". So yaahhh wa nako gidayon hahaha and lingaw man gd siya ka-talk, di ko ma-bore, di ko mahutdan ug storya niya, and comfy na kayko niya sab. I consider him as my bestie najud. 


Siya ang first reddit friend nako nga na meet nako in person nga nadugay nakog kastorya nga nafriend na nako in real life sab (in real life? Hahaha) nga di na virtual friend lang ba. 4 guys naman ata ako na meet dre sa reddit and ang 1st kay akong gi ghost kay manipulative sadboi, ang 2nd kay akoy gighost kay nakauyab, dayon sya ang 3rd, and ang 4th kay di nako bet kay hugawg kuko, yagiton hhahaha.


I thought platonic rajud mi kay mao rako sa iya. Like friend rajud ako turing niya, wa sab ko nagpafeel ug kanang naa bitaw koy affection or pagbati sa iya kay wala man jud pod, frenny rajud. But then naa nay times nga magduda naman ko kay lahi naman syag approach, kanang idk if ako lang noh pero makafeel man gud ko basta ang isa ka guy nay gusto sa ako kay lahi na ang actions, treatment and stuff. Pero wa ra nako pansina. Maoto nangutana ko niya if he likes me, mi Yes man pud ang pashnea hahahaha. And I thought 'yes' rato nga midayeg as a friend, di man diay. (Otits diay ako tawag niya kay mura naman gud syag tito oy, kanang dili tiguwang nawng kanang otits na ang age though, 2years ra gap namo pero pang tinuguwang najud kaayo siyag mga trip nia gen Z baya ko and baby face, aww hahaha)


Nia niingon naman na siyag naa daw syay iingon nako pero in person na, didto nako naka ingon nga ""hala maonajud ni, nagkagusto najud ni nako"" and wa ko nasayop. Kay pwede raman iingon sa chat pero nganong in person paman? Mga ing ana nga linyahan kay mag confess manag feelings hahahah. Well di pod nako siya mabasol, ako nagud ni CHARIZ!

1irk0z2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicMoldExposure/comments/1irk0z2/how_i_healed/,How I healed!,"I would like to say I am not a medical professional. But here is how I healed the cheapest and did my own thing. I spent thousands on a handful of doctors and specialists. Who knew nothing about this and kept redirecting me to another specialist. 

To start.. I had a roof leak. In Florida it always means mold if not properly fixed. Two months later, I had an excruciating migraine on August 15th. I thought I had covid again because that‚Äôs how it started the last time. But this was different. No medicine touched it. After about a week with no relief I called my PCP because it was the only person I could see. They misdiagnosed me with a sinus infection. So I saw an ENT, no polyps or any signs of a sinus infection. They told me to do a rinse and get Zyrtec. The pain was so severe I went to the ER. They gave my toradol and raglan, helped for an hour. Did a CT scan and it was clear. I was messed up neurologically. I had brain fog, POTS symptoms, fainting, low blood pressure, my skin was crawling, eye pressure, nose pressure, ear ache. I knew it was something in my environment when oxy and hydrocodone didn‚Äôt help the pain. 

I tested my apartment for mold and it came back negative and clear LOL, well it wasn‚Äôt! Apartment took no responsibility. I threatened a lawsuit and got my security deposit back and moved.

I wailed to my fianc√© and I made him pack my stuff and get me out of there. I felt better within two days of not being in my apartment. My fianc√© was not affected because I work from home so I was home all day everyday. He took a knife and cut down the ceiling where the leak was‚Ä¶. Black mold growth! 

Followed up with an allergist, spent $1200 on mold tests, nothing! Got an MRI, nothing! Saw a neurologist that prescribed nurtec, ubrevly, and Qulipta. My life savers!!!! It helped my symptom of a migraine but I needed to kick the illness.

My fianc√© made it his goal to get me better and he and I did a lot of reading. I noticed my headaches started then to appear around my cycle, so I knew the mold made me develop a hormone imbalance. Yay another issue! Also, I experienced more fainting and syncope.

Here is what helped me. 

-MOVE!
-Nurtec, Ubrevly are abortives and knocked out my excruciating migraines.
-Qulipta was a daily preventative for my tension headaches when the migraines subsided.
-Oxygen; I stole my grandmas oxygen mask and I felt like I could breathe and my brain was getting better. I did this for about a week once I moved out of the mold. 
Vitamins: methylated multivitamin, D3, magnesium, echinacea, saffron, cod liver oil capsule, and iodine. The saffron and iodine helped my hormones get back to normal.
Others: sauna! I didn‚Äôt have access to the infared one. But I did this 2-3 times a week and I swear it helped more than anything! Neck massages and ice packs were also good. 
Food: dry scooping creatine, ultima electrolytes (no sugar) found at sprouts, and amino acids (blue raspberry) in my water bottle daily. Switched to organic coffee because regular has mold in it and now I am intolerant. Whole Foods and basically carnivore. 
Extras: air purifiers with HEPA filters, get outside in the sun, sweat if you can work out, hot baths with epsom salt only. Ditch all candles and glade plug ins. Start cleaning with vinegar water. 
Detox: I tried two different detox binders and I bought the GI detox one on Amazon and I took that for about 80 days. Can‚Äôt say that it did much, but do not take vitamins with it. I took vitamins in the morning and the binder at night.  

I understand this is a lot. But I am telling you, our bodies can get rid of this. It takes time too. I stopped seeing all doctors except my neurologist and just refilled my migraine meds when I needed them. But the migraine is a symptom of the illness. We gotta rid the illness. It took me about five months to fully heal. I get a headache every now and then. And now I‚Äôm a mold detector because I can smell it now in certain restaurants and stores. 

My DMs are open if anyone would like to message me. Again, not a medical professional. Just a 30 yr old girl who thought suicide was my only option for relief. I am now healed!

1irjzjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Layoffs/comments/1irjzjq/got_a_job_but_i_know_it_wont_last/,"Got a job, but I know it won't last","I was laid off two years ago from a remote, west coast tech job that paid quite well for someone who lives in a low cost of living area in the Midwest. I was laid off after only 1 year of work as part of a RIF.

Though I have been freelancing since then, I don't make a lot of money, and supplement my income by selling personal items, taking surveys and selling my plasma. I've applied to hundreds and hundreds of jobs, done all the networking, upskilling, worked with resume coaches, job search experts, you name it, but I am an older GenX worker and we are not desired for most positions. I assumed I would never again find FT work with benefits again. 

It was a very, very competitive interview process but I did really well with it because SOMEONE GAVE ME A CHANCE. Most of us are still really great and hard workers, barely take any time off, give everything to a job and have many more years of productivity and creativity before we are put out to pasture.

I finally got another job - in tech and remote - and find that I am completely jaded by my previous experience. I don't expect this gig to last. I am going into every day expecting it will be my last day. I know how volatile and fluctuating jobs in tech are, especially remote, and am planning to sock away as much money as possible until they get rid of me, though I do have a lot of debt I have to pay off that I accumulated over the last couple of years. I will give my best every day, but I am keeping my wits about me and not investing emotionally in any way.

I am changing very little about my generally frugal way of living I've come to adjust to, other than I am no longer going to try to wash out my paper coffee filters and carefully dry them in the drainer and reuse them 3-4 times as best I can. I could only get them clean without ripping them about half the time and it honestly made me feel sad to have to get to this point. I already wash and re-use foil and ziploc bags so my big treat will be buying coffee filters so I can use a new one every day lol.

Now Tulsa has a Woodie Guthrie museum, who was arguably anti government, and Oklahoma seems to be moving the opposite direction of his stances. Yet they celebrate him?

Also how is it that America had events like the green corn rebellion, Ludlow massacre, basically laughed McCarthy out of politics for his communism scare, etc.. to what we are now where words like  ""socialism"" ""Marxism"" and specifically ""anarchism"" are now so far removed from any of the original economic theories and philosophy? Was this due to mass media / misinformation? At what point does a word like anarchism ""without a king"" mean chaos? Is it when Webster defines it? Common usage? When do historians say a word changes meaning? 

Sorry lots of questions... But I really would mostly just like to know more about ""socialism"" in Americas (not just the USA... but all America's would be a lot of history) past.

Edit : this Smithsonian Magazine article gave me a lot of information : https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/socialist-revolution-oklahoma-crushed-green-corn-rebellion-180973073/ : if anyone has more info on the green corn rebellion I would love to read it, or if you know the archivist mentioned in the article, Nigel Sellers, I would love to see / read those microfilms. I'll buy both you and Nigel coffee, dinner, wine or whatever make good company to you for a fascinating discussion.

1irjs9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1irjs9v/photon_chapter_2_the_interview/,[Photon] - Chapter 2 - The Interview,"I glanced down at the address I had written down, then back up at the setting sun sinking below the horizon. Great. The perfect time to go alone to a sketchy location. I probably could've skipped my evening class and gone earlier, but to be honest, I don't think daylight would make this any less shady.
Was going to this ""interview"" the smartest idea in the first place? No. Not in the slightest. However, my options at this point were starving to death or maybe getting murdered, so I was willing to take my chances.
I didn't know where this place was, if anyone would be there when I found it, or what I'd even do If there was someone there. In spite of my innate survival instincts, I pressed on.
I tried entering the address into the GPS linked to my Photon. No results. Perfect. I tried changing the last digit of the address to at least find a building nearby. The light around me began to shift and move. The light around me flickered, forming a map in my hands. It displayed the city's streets, complete with a red line leading to my destination.
It was only about a mile away, so it didn't take me long to find it. When I arrived, the street was filled with tall office buildings, but none of them carried the same address I had. When I was about to give up, a faint light flickered on in an alley between two of the buildings.
The alley was dark, damp, and had a few lingering puddles of God knows what. As I approached the light, I saw that it was coming from the single window on a building the size of a small house tucked at the back of the alley. It looked exactly like the kind of place you'd find at the back of an alley. Ugly, old, and would probably collapse when hit with a stiff breeze. I stepped up to the door and noticed that the address was posted on the wall. Much to my dismay, it was the exact address I was looking for.
I hesitated at the door and paced, weighing my options. Should I knock? Or was starvation really as bad as they say? After much deliberation, I decided that I'd rather die quickly.
I knocked. 
And... nothing. A minute passed with no sign of an answer from the other side of the door. Just as I turned to leave, the door flung open behind me. Someone grabbed my arm and pulled me inside. I expected to see a burly man holding a weapon, but instead I was greeted with a tall woman in an ill-fitted suit. She looked like she'd just fought a losing battle with her own coffee maker and hadn't closed her eyes for anything other than to blink. Without a word, she let go of me, sat down behind a desk and started to write something down.
""Were you followed?"" she said without looking up. 
""I don't know...was I supposed to be?"" I replied nervously.
""Doesn't matter,"" she said, waving it off. ""My name is Lisa, I'm your boss.""
""Wait‚Äîwho said I agreed to work here?""
She put down whatever she was writing and raised an eyebrow, ""You showed up, didn't you?""
""Well, yeah, but I don't even know what an information examiner does.""
""I have no idea,"" she said, beaming proudly. ""But doesn't it sound official?""
I let out a long sigh, ""So what exactly is it you do?""
Lisa leaned forward, her tone suddenly serious. ""We're going to save the world.""
""Right. Of course. Why wouldn't we,"" I replied, my face devoid of expression. 
""I know it sounds like a lot, but don't worry‚ÄîI have an ace up my sleeve.""
""And that would be‚Ä¶?""
she stood up and leaned over the desk with excitement, ""I can see the future!""
Her dramatic declaration didn't land quite as intended, thanks to the coffee stains and the bags under her eyes. Honestly, she looked like she could barely see the present.
""You know, on second thought, I think I'd rather starve after all,"" I said as I turned to leave.
""Wait! I can prove it""
""Why should I stick around for that?""
""If you stay, I'll give you this month's pay in advance.""
I immediately turned around. ""Alright, let's see this proof then.""
""Here read this,"" she said as she handed me the paper she was writing on before.
I scanned the page, my eyes widening. It detailed our entire conversation, word for word, up to the point of me reading it. I knew for a fact that she stopped writing partway through the conversation. ""Okay, so you can predict what I'm going to say, big deal. How's that going to save the world?""
""Oh, I can predict much more than just your sarcastic remarks,"" she said with a smug grin. ""Let's just say that the future isn't looking too bright for us.""
""Even if the world is in danger, why do you need me?""
""Oh no, no, no I don't really need you in particular, but one woman can only do so much you know,"" she extended her hand, ""Anyway, congratulations on finishing the interview you are officially hired. By the way, what's your name?""
I shook her hand and replied, ""it's Washi.""
Lisa chuckled. ""Washi, huh? Interesting name.""
""You think it's funny, don't you?""
""Oh, not at all,"" she said, failing to hide her smirk.
""Whatever, can I have my paycheck now?""
""Sure, it's right here."" She pulled out an envelope and handed it to me. 
She handed me the paycheck. I grabbed it and tried to pull it away, but she was still gripping onto it.
""I expect to see you here tomorrow at the same time.""
""You know, I could just take this money and never come back.""
""You certainly could, but I'd strongly advise against it,"" she said in a way that sent a shiver down my spine. 
""Was that a threat?""
She smiled, ""You won't have to find out as long as you show up tomorrow.""
""I was just joking, of course I'll come tomorrow. Although I really have to be going right now so if you don't mind, I'll be taking this"" I pulled the envelope out of her hand as she let go.
""See you tomorrow.""
""I can't wait,"" I said, already halfway out the door.
After the building was out of sight, I took a peek inside the envelope. As happy as I was to see some money, I still couldn't help but be dismayed at the small portion of it. For an entire month's pay, it was maybe minimum wage, but even that might be too generous.
I put the money aside for the moment and took solace in the fact that I could buy food when I got back to college. I had hoped to start going back to the coffee shop again, but it looked like that wouldn't be happening for a while.
Once I got to my room I collapsed on my bed. I didn't know if I was exhausted from the lack of food or from worrying about tomorrow. Maybe, just maybe, I would go to sleep and wake up the next morning and realize that it was all a dream.

Hi everyone,

I recently took the Bain & Company online assessment through Sova, and I‚Äôm wondering if my completion time might impact my chances. The test was fairly easy, but now I regret taking a coffee break!

Here‚Äôs how long I spent on each section:

	‚Ä¢	Numerical Reasoning: Completed in ~8 minutes 
	‚Ä¢	Verbal Reasoning: Completed in ~8 minutes 
	‚Ä¢	Logical Reasoning: Completed in ~48 minutes
	‚Ä¢	ü§ìü§ì I thought it had unlimited time, so I took a break to make coffee and only later realized the timer was running. This caused me to take much longer than expected.
	‚Ä¢	Personality Test: Took ~38 minutes

Now, I‚Äôm worried that my time management‚Äîespecially the long break during the Logical Reasoning section‚Äîmight hurt my application. Does Bain consider how fast you complete the test or if you let time run out in certain sections?

Has anyone had a similar experience? I‚Äôd appreciate any insights!

Thanks in advance!

I can definitely see the use case of his product and do think it has a broad spectrum of users. 

He has built it from scratch and it is currently only available for MacOS. He is going to start  building a version for Windows operating system but it‚Äôs a whole different programming language and infrastructure.

He‚Äôs been working on it for probably 3-4 months now. He offered me to become partners about a week ago. He called me late at night telling me that he‚Äôs going to need someone to grow and promote it while he works on improving the app and building the windows version.

At first he offered me 20% but I told him that‚Äôs way too low for me to be fully invested in it. He made sure to specify that even if we make $10K revenue monthly, I‚Äôll be making $2k monthly month after month for the same effort of getting the first $2k a month.

By reference, I live in Montreal. So cost of living is still quite high. And plus, his app only works on Mac, so I had to buy a MacBook for this. Although in all honesty, I did need a computer, never been a fan of Apple, but still would of needed a relatively ‚Äúgood‚Äù computer to what I had (probably losing 1h a day on my current computer because of lag and it shutting down randomly). I bought a MacBook Pro M1 16gB RAM 512gb SSD for $1500 CAD.

He started advertising it 2 weeks ago. We‚Äôve had the most success out of Reddit. He started posting on different subreddits and gathering peoples honest opinions and suggestions, gaining customers doing so. His first day he got 37 paid users. I can‚Äôt quite find the exact data as I‚Äôm looking for it but as of a couple days ago if memory serves me right, we have 46 active users. 

We also have a list of 105 people on the waiting list for the Windows version. We charge $6.99 USD per month (literally a Starbucks coffee) which is about $10 CAD. The vast majority of it is profit. Users pay per how many tokens they use and we are available on all current popular LLM‚Äôs. 

The interesting part is that in order to reach those numbers, not much time was required in total. Either it was a stroke of luck or maybe there is some substance to this‚Ä¶ We currently agreed at 25% equity (very hard to budge) for me to work on it pretty much full time to create content and promote it on Reddit and other forms. I‚Äôll be generating short-form content etc‚Ä¶

If you were him, how much would you give me? Would you structure it differently? Is 25% equity fair as compensation for what I‚Äôll be doing? We are good friends so trust isn‚Äôt an issue. He has worked on building it and still is which I understand but is it worth me working on it full time?

Just looking to get a third eye and opinion on this!

Not sure if I missed out something important. Will EDIT back in case I did forget to mention something important.

I have no previous experience promoting anything but I have much more of a communication strong suit than he has and I‚Äôm always very dedicated to what I do, which is why people generally like working with me.",2,1739797934.0,SaaS,3,1.0,False

Fresh out of ministry school, I landed a completely random job as a Crime Scene Cleaner. My job took me all over the U.S., cleaning up crime scenes, hoarder homes, infectious disease sites, suicides‚Äîyou name it.

I was flying three to four times a week. And every single time, I was ABSOLUTELY terrified. I‚Äôd wake up nauseous, nervous, and stressed. The night before a flight, I couldn‚Äôt eat or drink anything. I‚Äôd stay up late, obsessing over the trip. This went on for five years. Daily stress and anxiety. It affected my life, my marriage, and my work.

On the flights, I was tense the entire time. Any little bump would send me into a panic.

In 2013, I decided to do something about it. I started taking flying lessons. I read books about airplanes and how to become a pilot. I did everything I could to understand my fear. But no matter how much I learned, I was still scared every time I flew.

Then one day, on a Southwest flight, I told a pilot I wanted to become a pilot myself. He invited me into the cockpit, showed me around‚Äîit was incredible! As I returned to my seat and the doors were about to close, he came all the way back to me and said, ""Hey, I forgot to mention‚Äîif you want to become a pilot, you might want to get a bachelor's degree in anything. It‚Äôs not required, but it‚Äôll help tremendously.""

That conversation changed everything.

By October 2013, my wife and I had just welcomed our son, and that gave me the motivation I needed to apply to college. I went back to school to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering. In 2015, I switched jobs to work in a warehouse so I could stay home and go to school full-time.

In 2019, I graduated with a bachelor‚Äôs in mechanical engineering and a minor in aerospace engineering. I started working in data center design, and it was great‚Äîexcept for one problem.

I started flying again. And all of the anxiety came right back.

I hadn‚Äôt solved my problem at all. LOL.

Fast forward to 2023. Unfortunately, my wife and I separated. I went to therapy for a year, and that‚Äôs when I finally uncovered the real issue. My therapist helped me realize that my fear wasn‚Äôt about flying‚Äîit was about control. She encouraged me to accept that I wasn‚Äôt in control and to shift my focus to the exciting things I‚Äôd do once I arrived at my destination.

Then came a turning point.

I got really sick while in Denver. It was awful. I had to extend my stay by a day before I could fly home. My ex-wife, thankfully, helped me book a new flight. When I got to the airport, I was so exhausted from being sick that I didn‚Äôt have the energy to be afraid of flying.

Instead, I was just grateful. I was so excited to get home to Atlanta that I nearly cried when the plane took off. I had tears of joy because I knew I‚Äôd be home soon. For the first time ever, flying felt like relief.

And just like that, my fear was gone.

Ever since that moment, I LOVE to fly. I get cozy in my seat, relax, and put on a good movie, video game, or book.

Right now, it‚Äôs 8 AM, and I have a flight at 1 PM. If this were 2013, I‚Äôd be pacing around, stressed out, not eating, dreading the flight. Instead, I‚Äôm here, finishing some emails, enjoying a good breakfast, and feeling calm. I‚Äôm excited to go to Denver, see my colleagues, and have a great few days of on-site work.

Next week, I‚Äôm flying to Switzerland with my son. It‚Äôll be the longest flight I‚Äôve ever taken, but I‚Äôm not worried at all. I‚Äôm just happy to be traveling to such a beautiful place with my son‚Äîand beyond thrilled to see my sister again after five years!

I don‚Äôt know if this helps anyone, but here‚Äôs the takeaway: sometimes, facts aren‚Äôt enough.

I flew small airplanes. I studied how to become a pilot. I minored in aerospace engineering. But knowing the facts didn‚Äôt fix my fear.

At the end of the day, I had to let go of my need for control and just enjoy the ride. It took therapy and experience, and if you‚Äôre struggling, I encourage you to seek that help too. It makes flying (and life) so much easier.

How Does Puravive Work?

Puravive primarily works by boosting the levels of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in the body. BAT is crucial for burning calories and generating heat through a process known as thermogenesis. Research indicates that individuals with higher BAT levels typically maintain lower body weight, as their bodies can effectively convert stored fat into energy. When BAT levels are low, thermogenesis decreases, leading to fat accumulation. By enhancing BAT, Puravive aims to activate thermogenesis, which enables the body to burn fat more efficiently. This mechanism supports healthy weight loss while also promoting overall metabolic health and increased energy levels, making it a powerful addition to a weight management routine.

¬†

Why Choose Puravive?

Puravive stands out because of its scientific foundation and natural approach to weight management. Instead of quick fixes, it focuses on gradually improving your metabolism by enhancing BAT production. The ingredients in Puravive don‚Äôt just support weight loss‚Äîthey also promote overall well-being, including better cardiovascular health and increased energy.

Its natural formulation, combined with research-backed methods, makes Puravive a well-rounded option for those seeking long-term weight loss.

How Does Puravive Work?

Puravive primarily works by boosting the levels of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in the body. BAT is crucial for burning calories and generating heat through a process known as thermogenesis. Research indicates that individuals with higher BAT levels typically maintain lower body weight, as their bodies can effectively convert stored fat into energy. When BAT levels are low, thermogenesis decreases, leading to fat accumulation. By enhancing BAT, Puravive aims to activate thermogenesis, which enables the body to burn fat more efficiently. This mechanism supports healthy weight loss while also promoting overall metabolic health and increased energy levels, making it a powerful addition to a weight management routine.

¬†

Why Choose Puravive?

Puravive stands out because of its scientific foundation and natural approach to weight management.

How Does Puravive Work?

Puravive primarily works by boosting the levels of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in the body. BAT is crucial for burning calories and generating heat through a process known as thermogenesis. Research indicates that individuals with higher BAT levels typically maintain lower body weight, as their bodies can effectively convert stored fat into energy. When BAT levels are low, thermogenesis decreases, leading to fat accumulation. By enhancing BAT, Puravive aims to activate thermogenesis, which enables the body to burn fat more efficiently. This mechanism supports healthy weight loss while also promoting overall metabolic health and increased energy levels, making it a powerful addition to a weight management routine.

¬†

Why Choose Puravive?

Puravive stands out because of its scientific foundation and natural approach to weight management. Instead of quick fixes, it focuses on gradually improving your metabolism by enhancing BAT production. The ingredients in Puravive don‚Äôt just support weight loss‚Äîthey also promote overall well-being, including better cardiovascular health and increased energy.

Its natural formulation, combined with research-backed methods, makes Puravive a well-rounded option for those seeking long-term weight loss.

Who Can Use Puravive?

Puravive is designed for adults looking to lose weight safely and naturally. However, there are certain groups that should consult a healthcare provider before using the supplement:

And now it‚Äôs asking me to rate my own replacement. Welcome to the world where AI isn't just knocking at the door‚Äîit's already moved in, rearranged the furniture, and is settling in with a cup of coffee.

Case in point: Christie's latest art auction, where AI-made masterpieces are headline acts. Imagine artworks created by code attending prestigious art auctions and racking up prices that make even seasoned artists raise an eyebrow. We've come a long way from brushstrokes, folks. This is Prometheus with a palette.

Here's the scoop: Artists are protesting. And not just because AI art is taking the spotlight but because it's potentially built on their own work‚Äîwithout their nod of consent. The crux? AI models might be trained on existing artworks, raising the old-age question: when does inspiration turn into theft? Shoutout to Karla Ortiz and other brave hearts raising this issue, turning auctions into battlegrounds of ethical debates and creative survival.

But, the hunger for AI-driven art? It's insatiable, particularly amongst the blockchaining, crypto-loving nouveau-riche who are all in for digital detours in art. What's the endgame here? Some say it's art democratization, others call it a high-tech rip-off. Supporters argue AI is all about creative liberty, innovation‚Äîthe next Renaissance (for the robots, at least).

To round up, here‚Äôs some food for thought: Is AI cheating its way into our creative hearts, or is it just pushing the boundaries of what we call art? What do you think about AI art‚Äîjust another techno-trend or the dawn of an artistic revolution? Let's hash it out in the comments below. üé®ü§ñ",1,1739797357.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

1) Day 2 was definitely the toughest day for some reason. It definitely felt like more of a struggle physically and mentally.

2) On the other hand, I was surprised that Day 3 was easier than Day 2. I actually felt more energised on that day for some reason and was able to go for longer walks and to the gym (strength training and not cardio).

3) Electrolytes definitely helped but also staying hydrated. Even if I was having black coffee or herbal tea, I'd always have a glass of water first.

4) It really helped me to keep busy and I'd saved up some tasks to do which meant I had to concentrate, use my hands etc. Personally, I found it harder if I tried to listen to podcasts, watched YouTube videos or other activities which were ""passive"" but everyone is different.

5) I broke my fast with a light breakfast and then had a larger lunch and dinner. I'd planned in advance what I'd have for each meal. This was to help me resist the urge to just ""binge"" after the fast but to eat normally. However, I didn't feel that urge which was a relief.

Pros of where I am currently - my hours are solid , allowing me to pick up a consistent side gig for a good amount of extra money. My net salary this year with my full time and part time  combined was $79K. 

I am my own manager - department of me, COO and directors are very supportive and give me a lot of creative leeway.

Cons of where I am - stability. My job is NOT tied to any specific grant, but maternal health (perinatal through postpartum) is on the chopping block.

Pros of new gig - stability - not tied to any gov funding.

I know the staff - we all get along for the most part.

Cons - I would need to be flexible, unable to pick up steady hours , would be a pay cut. 
This job is offering $65 as the max, and I can probably negotiate $67, but guarantee of being able to take solid / regular hours somewhere else wouldn‚Äôt be guaranteed 


Can be a little petty amongst mid level full timers and part timers , but I‚Äôve always been good and leaving pettiness at the door.

1irj319,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/1irj319/when_should_you_use_pronouns_in_spanish/,When Should You Use Pronouns in Spanish?,"Even though Spanish allows you to omit subject pronouns, because Spanish verb endings already tell you who the subject is. (For example, in English, in the sentence ""I run every morning."" it is necessary to use the pronoun. Meanwhile, in Spanish, no pronoun is needed: ""Corro cada ma√±ana.""Since ""corro"" already shows that the subject is yo, the pronoun is not required.)¬†

There are situations where using them is necessary or more natural. Here are the key cases:

1. For Emphasis or Contrast. Example: Yo quiero caf√©, pero t√∫ prefieres t√©. (I want coffee, but you prefer tea.) When you highlight who is doing the action, the pronoun makes the contrast clear.
2. To Avoid Confusion. Example: Carlos y Pedro dijeron que ellos vendr√°n m√°s tarde. (Carlos and Pedro said that they will come later.) The pronoun ""ellos"" makes it clear that Carlos and Pedro themselves are coming. Otherwise, it could mean they said that someone else is coming.

1. When the Verb Form is Ambiguous. Example: Usted trabaja aqu√≠, ¬øverdad? (You work here, right?) In some tenses, √©l/ella/usted and yo share verb endings. For example, in the present indicative, we have √©l trabaja and ella trabaja, or in the imperfect indicative, √©l trabajaba and yo trabajaba. So in this example, using the pronoun clarifies who is being referred to.

1. When Changing Subjects in a Sentence. Example: Yo fui al cine, pero √©l prefiri√≥ quedarse en casa. (I went to the movies, but he preferred to stay home.) The pronoun makes it clear that the subject has changed.
2. In formal writing or polite speech, pronouns are used more often. Example: Usted tiene una cita a las 10. (You have an appointment at 10.)

What do you think about pronouns in Spanish? Is it cool that they aren‚Äôt necessary in most situations, or does it just make conversations and understanding more confusing?

I can tell a lot of us were feeling tired from the rounds of rice wine from the night before. Before our departure, the group meets at the town square in the old quarter where they have a few open air restaurants and coffee shops. Our breakfast for the day is banh cuon, rice flour rolls with a delicious filling of either egg or pork. In most of Vietnam, banh cuon is generally served with a side dipping sauce of sweet fish sauce. However, banh cuon is served differently in Ha Giang, where it is enjoyed with a bowl of bone broth soup on the side. It‚Äôs a popular breakfast that's meant to keep you warm in the northern mountain climates.¬†



As soon as we leave Dong Van, the road's elevation gets higher and higher as we ascend the Ma Pi Leng Pass. Before I know it, the group is now riding on roads stretching over the side of mountains. This is the highest we‚Äôve been since riding the Ha Giang Loop. The panoramic views here are stunning, the breeze is pleasant and all I can see is my fellow travelers taking pictures and videos on the back of the EZ driver bikes. It‚Äôs a beautiful stretch of road that left me in awe. We stop every so often on the side of the road to enjoy the views of the Nho Que river and distant mountain ranges.



Eventually we reach a rest stop with a coffee shop and access to what‚Äôs known as the Sky Path. It‚Äôs a pathway that runs parallel above the Ma Pi Leng Pass. The group parks their bikes at the rest point, grabs a cup of sweet Ha Giang coffee, freshens up and we start our short trek. The pathway can get narrow at times so I had to keep my wits about me. Regardless, it feels nice to be closer to nature and not have to sit on the back of the motorbike. Along the way we relish the sweeping views of the Tu San Canyon and the Nho Que River. The views are of course gorgeous but admittedly not too different from what you see riding the pass below. During the trek, we encounter numerous interesting rock formations and also the Ma Pi Leng Eye, a great photo op. It‚Äôs a perfectly round hole formed out the side of the mountain, giving you a peak at the pass and the views below. The whole trek took about 2 hours with the return trip.



After the Sky Walk, we rode the final stretch of the Ma Pi Leng Pass. At the end of the pass, we had the opportunity to go down to the Nho Que River. The road down was steep and narrow so the EZ driver had to drive carefully. We reached a small local village before we boarded a boat to cruise the waterways. It‚Äôs a nice change of scenery from the rugged landscapes experienced while riding the loop. The river is a beautiful dark emerald color and I felt engulfed by the towering mountains on both sides. It did start to rain at this point, so most of the group got wet.¬†



After the hour long boat ride, we made our way to Meo Vac town to refuel for lunch. It‚Äôs a small humble rural town and the surroundings were quite beautiful. We found a small restaurant here serving com lam: rice cooked in a bamboo tube, served either with grilled fish or pork with stir fried veggies. It‚Äôs a simple meal but greatly appreciated after the physically active morning. There's a big morning market that opens every Sunday here but unfortunately we arrived on a weekday. So we made our way towards Du Gia village, a peaceful and unspoiled gem found along the loop.¬†



Du Gia is located in a peaceful valley full of rice terraces where we encountered ethnic tribes going about their daily lives. As the group walked through the village, we saw many locals dressed in their traditional clothing and the traditional stilt houses made by the Tay ethnic group. I can tell there were several other different tribes living in the area due to the differences in their clothing. Regardless of the language barrier, we were always greeted with warm smiles. The group ended up staying at a friendly homestay owned by Tay hosts and their families. Of course we had a family style dinner with a side of the ‚Äúhappy water‚Äù that we've grown accustomed to. This will be our last night in Ha Giang, which has been a blast so far!

[An aerial view of an ilmenite open pit mine in a canyon in the central region of Kirovohrad, Ukraine, on Wednesday. \(Efrem Lukatsky \/ Associated Press\)](https://preview.redd.it/t3at5ke5xoje1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c12e7111ebe0c8b5ede4f4ccb055857f0f732ce)

KIROVOHRAD REGION, Ukraine¬†‚Äî¬†The mineral ilmenite is extracted from mounds of sand deep in the earth and refined using a method that summons the force of gravity, resulting in a substance that glimmers like a moonlit sky.

Ukraine boasts vast reserves of ilmenite ‚Äî the primary ore used to produce titanium ‚Äî in the heavy mineral sands that stretch for miles along the country‚Äôs embattled east.

Much of it, as with all of Ukraine‚Äôs critical minerals industry, is underdeveloped because of war as well as onerous state policies.

That is poised to change if the Trump administration agrees to a deal with Ukraine to exchange critical minerals for continued American military aid.

In the central region of Kirovohrad, an ilmenite open-pit mine is a canyon of precious deposits that its owner is keen to develop with U.S. companies. But many unknowns stand in the way of turning these riches into profit: cost, licensing terms and whether such a deal will be underpinned by security guarantees.

# Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday at the Munich Security Conference that he did not permit his ministers to sign a mineral resource agreement with the U.S. because the current version is not ‚Äúready to protect us, our interests.‚Äù

Ukrainian businessmen with knowledge of the minerals industry also privately expressed skepticism about whether a deal is viable. The capital-intensive industry is unlikely to yield results in years, if not decades, because geological data are either limited or classified. Many question what conditions American companies are willing to risk to build up the industry and whether existing Ukrainian policies that have so far deterred local businessmen will accommodate foreign investors.

‚ÄúThe main thing we can gain is certain security guarantees obtained through economic means, so that someone stronger than us has an interest in protecting us,‚Äù said Andriy Brodsky, CEO of Velta, a leading titanium mining company in Ukraine.

# The question of security guarantees

A deal could help strengthen Kyiv‚Äôs relationship with the Trump administration.

The United States is a major consumer of critical raw earth minerals such as lithium and gallium, two elements that Ukraine has in proven reserves. Trump has specifically mentioned rare earth elements, but these are not well researched, according to industry experts.

Titanium, used in aerospace, defense and industry, is also high in demand and the U.S. is a leading importer of ilmenite. Sourcing the minerals from Ukraine would reduce future reliance on Russia and China.

In exchange, Kyiv would continue to receive a steady stream of American weaponry that offers leverage against Moscow and without which Ukraine cannot ward off future Russian aggression in the event of a cease-fire.

The question of security guarantees is a sticking point for companies, Ukrainian businessmen and analysts said. A senior Ukrainian official, speaking anonymously to describe private conversations, said that U.S. companies expressed interest in investing but needed to ensure their billions will be safeguarded in the event of renewed conflict.

Brodsky suggested that the presence of American business interests alone might eventually act as a guarantee.

‚ÄúIf this process starts, it will continue,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOnce the investment figures exceed hundreds of billions, the Americans, a highly pragmatic people, will protect their profits earned on Ukrainian soil. They will defend their interests against Russia, China, Korea, Iran and anyone else. They will protect what they consider theirs.‚Äù

# Growing American interest

Brodsky said the conversation among U.S. businesses is changing in Kyiv‚Äôs favor.

‚ÄúA lot of people in very serious and wealthy offices are saying that now, we ‚Äî our country and my company ‚Äî are in the right place and doing exactly what needs to be done at this moment,‚Äù he said.

Ukraine has never been attractive to foreign investors because of prohibitive government policies ‚Äî not offering incentives to attract foreigners, for instance. Brodsky said international companies will need to pair up with local partners to flourish.

American companies have several ways to enter the market, explained Ksenia Orynchak, director of the National Assn. of Extractive Industries of Ukraine, but would require traversing ‚Äúcertain circles of hell‚Äù in Ukraine‚Äôs bureaucracy. Teaming up with an existing Ukrainian license owner is possibly the most straightforward.

She said more exploration is needed in the field and hinted existing data may have been acquired through ulterior motives. Under the Soviet system, geologists stood to gain if they claimed to have found large reserves.

‚ÄúSomeone did it so that Moscow would praise Ukrainian geologists or Soviet geologists,‚Äù she said.

She advises American investors to lower existing thresholds for exploration because bidding can take place in areas where reserves are only presumed, not proven.

‚ÄúI believe, and so does the expert community, that this is not right. In fact, we are selling a pig in a poke,‚Äù she said.

# A historically untapped sector

At the extraction site, the air is dense with ilmenite dust. When the afternoon sun‚Äôs rays pierce the darkened space, they sparkle and dance in the air. The soot covers the faces of workers who spend hours inside every day extracting the precious material from sand.

The gravity separation method removes unwanted elements in the ore and water separated from the mineral rains down through metal-lined floors. Workers are used to getting wet and don‚Äôt bat an eye. Titanium is developed from the purified ilmenite at a different facility.

Brodsky‚Äôs company began when Brodsky bought an expired license for geological exploration and a business plan for $7 million. It would be eight years and many millions more invested before he could even think about production capacity.

The deal also does not factor in a crucial element that could prove challenging later: According to the Constitution, the subsoil where extraction would take place belongs to the Ukrainian people .

‚ÄúI am very afraid that they already had disapproving reviews, that everything is being given away,‚Äù Orynchak said.

Those sensitivities were echoed among workers at the mine. Speaking anonymously to voice his true thoughts without fear or repercussion, one said: ‚ÄúIf you have a vegetable garden in your home, do you invite a foreigner to take it?‚Äù

The high risk often is a key reason that some Ukrainian businessmen privately express skepticism about the deal.

# When one businessman of a major group of companies heard about the arms-for-minerals deal, his first impression was: ‚ÄúThis is just hot air. This is a very capital intensive industry. Just to take ground from an open pit will cost you billions. Not millions, billions.‚Äù

Congress and the White House face a host of fiscal challenges over the course of 2025 that will impact U.S. defense spending. Congress has yet to appropriate funding for fiscal year (FY) 2025 as the Department of Defense (DOD) continues to operate under a continuing resolution (CR). The Trump administration must also submit its budget request to Congress for FY 2026.

However, action on the FY 2025 and FY 2026 defense budgets must also be taken amidst the backdrop of other major fiscal issues. The administration and Congress must negotiate over suspending or increasing the debt ceiling to prevent the government from defaulting on its debt. Congressional failure to pass appropriations for FY 2025 or at least another CR by March 14 would lead to a government shutdown, while DOD faces the threat of sequestration if full-year appropriations are not passed for the entire government by April 30. Finally, the expiration of tax cuts passed under the first Trump administration at the end of the year, and their possible extension will be another point of negotiation.

Congress and the administration could try to tackle some combination appropriations for FY 2025 and FY 2026, the debt ceiling, and tax cut extensions in a¬†[grand bargain](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2024/09/national-security-deserves-better-house-speakers-6-month-cr-plan/399612/). Republicans in both the House and Senate are considering using the budget reconciliation process to do so.

However, the convergence of all of these fiscal issues in 2025, along with narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress and political divisions between and within the two parties, poses a major challenge to effectively funding DOD and the rest of the federal government.

Below are the key dates for fiscal milestones that could impact defense spending in 2025.

CENTENNIAL, Colo. (February 4, 2025) ‚Äì NioCorp Developments Ltd. (‚Äú**NioCorp**‚Äù or the ‚Äú**Company**‚Äù) (**NASDAQ:NB**) is pleased to announce that the U.S. Export-Import Bank (‚Äú**EXIM**‚Äù or the ‚Äú**Bank**‚Äù) is advancing NioCorp‚Äôs application for prospective EXIM project financing of its Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project (‚Äú**Elk Creek Project**‚Äù) in southeast Nebraska to an independent Technical Review, part of EXIM‚Äôs second level of project due diligence.

As part of its loan review process, EXIM has selected Colorado-based RPMGlobal USA, Inc. (‚Äú**RPMGlobal**‚Äù) to conduct a technical review of the Elk Creek Project.¬† NioCorp this week executed a professional services agreement with RPMGlobal to conduct its review on behalf of the Bank.

NioCorp‚Äôs application for EXIM funding of the Elk Creek Project passed EXIM‚Äôs first level of due diligence, known as Technical Review Committee-1 (TRC-1), in October 2023.¬† The independent technical review is part of the Bank‚Äôs second review level, known as TRC-2.¬† Among other elements of TRC-2 review is an environment review, which the Bank continues to advance toward selection of an independent reviewer.

Following TRC-2 approval, if any, the Bank will conduct a third-level review of NioCorp‚Äôs overall application, known as TRC-3.¬† If approved at TRC-3, the application will be subject to final decision by the EXIM Board of Directors.

In April 2024, EXIM provided NioCorp with a preliminary indicative term sheet for possible financing.¬† NioCorp has engaged JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to assist NioCorp in seeking debt financing supported by the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. (‚Äú**EXIM**‚Äú) to advance NioCorp‚Äôs proposed Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project (the ‚Äú**Project**‚Äú).

I have a really weird problem: my right armpit sweats excessively, while my left armpit stays mostly dry or just slightly damp. And it's not just normal sweating‚Äîit's a lot, and the smell is unbearable. Imagine cutting onions, leaving them out for hours, and then walking into the kitchen‚Äîit's that kind of intense, sharp odor.

I used to notice this more after drinking coffee or when I was nervous or excited. But even though I quit coffee and energy drinks over six months ago, the issue hasn‚Äôt gone away. It happens especially after sports, but the worst is when I forget to apply deodorant after a shower. If I don‚Äôt use something super strong, like Rexona 3X (which claims to last 96 hours), the smell just breaks through any regular deodorant.

It‚Äôs always just the right armpit. Sweating like crazy. Smelling awful. No idea why.

The other week, though, I made my most expensive mess and that was not with the aeropress at all.

I have used the Clever Dripper for many years and use it whenever I‚Äôm doing coffee for me and my wife. Just as with the aeropress, I can probably do the whole process in the dark by now.

But just recently, I bought a Hario Switch, thinking that it could fill the same function as the Clever, but also enable a regular pour over.

With the Clever, you can always pour hot water in it when it is standing on a flat surface (e.g. the scale). With the Hario Switch, not so much. If you don‚Äôt make sure that the actual switch is in the right position and that the ball isn‚Äôt stuck, the water will flow right through it.

This isn‚Äôt the first time‚Äîhe‚Äôs always late when we make plans, even for simple things like going for coffee or a walk or something, barely puts in effort to stay in touch, and if I don‚Äôt reach out first, I won‚Äôt hear from him for days. It feels like he has no respect for my time and that I‚Äôm happy to just wait around till it suits him and his schedule. Every time I call him out on these incidents, he apologizes with some excuse, but nothing changes, and it just creates more distance between us.

Been doing this for the last three years and feel I've exhausted the more obvious stops between the two in the main cities... Durham, Newcastle, Liverpool, Bradford, Manchester, Lincoln, Sheffield, Nottingham, York, Leeds etc, so looking at towns that have good rail links really, obviously these are 11/12 hour days and quite draining but see it as a good opportunity and don't mind the hassle tbh

1iriiwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1iriiwh/just_getting_things_off_my_chest/,Just getting things off my chest,"About a year and a half ago I met this girl let's call her A. I liked her instantly, but almost as soon as we met, she found a boyfriend (just a timing thing). So I figured eh... time to move on. We had great communication, she is beautiful and a very cool person, but I figured dealing with my own things would be for the best. For a few months we remained on friendly terms, but one of our mutual friends kept insisting we should get together. She broke up with her bf, we started talking intensely, like for 10ish hours per day, in person or over texts and calls, so eventually I wanted for things to progress. She didn't feel ready for a relationship, so she said no, very respectfully. I stepped back, we didn't talk for a month or two, but picked it up again in June/July? We were friendly through the whole summer, I tried texting some girls, went out with another, but it didn't work out. Whole time I knew where she was and what she was up to as she was texting me. Then came my birthday in September and we talked more than ever before. We are very similar as people, and we created this safe space where we shared everything with each other. I fell for her hard. She in turn initiated calls with my parents and sister, so after that I asked her out, and we started going out together. She still said she wasn't ready for a relationship, but wanted to test the waters and see where it was going. October and November were fantastic, I felt like I was floating, she was very happy as she kept communicating that to me. We didn't get to go out much due to school and work obligations tho, but we managed to hang out every day. Then out of the blue she met up with a guy named L. She told me about him, explained where and when they were going, etc. But I felt uneasy. Still that was a one time thing, she didn't mention him again and I figured I shouldn't fuss.

Then came December, and it was hell on earth. We were in a situation where we had to spend all the time together in a high pressure environment, with other people among which is L guy. I saw he liked her a great deal, we had a major fight over it, as she didn't do anything to shut that down. Other problems propped up her mother didn't want to talk to me due to us dating (she ignored me saying hello to her in the street), she kept me a secret from most of her friends and family, she said she wasn't sure if she was comfortable with me (I truly TRULY didn't do anything she didn't want, had her full 100% consent), she threw my hand away when someone was approaching us, she denied there was anything between us to many people. All of this came out mid December. And then I remembered- we were never clearly out in the open, we only went to places no one would see us. I was heartbroken as she was a MAJOR part of my life, I was completely open, tried to make her feel safe and loved, but... I had to break up. I just had to. And I did. She yelled said some hurtful things, but I felt like I had no choice in the matter. I didn't feel like she trusted or respected me or us.

Then she proceeded to flirt with L for the next 10 days, right after our break up, right in front of me, and due to my obligations at the place I could not leave. I had to watch. She knew, she did it anyway. In the end she entered into a relationship with L, and told me she loved me, but I chose this, I left her. She gave him everything she didn't to me: she was clear, she went public with him etc. And she said it was because of our break up. I went no contact, but she reached out, and I buckled. We started talking again after about a week, and she wanted us to be friends, that under no circumstances we would ever get back together. I told her I wasn't clear on my feelings, but she still said I love you, and asked me to say it back. I was weak, and buckled, we chatted, and met up at a coffee shop, where we cuddled and joked and talked. I tried to frame this as a friendly thing, but I couldn't. I wanted us to talk and set boundaries, but we never did. We had a few fights since then, but she keeps reaching out. Communication is a lot colder, and I can honestly say that I do not love her anymore. I just... I just remember what she meant to me once, and I can't express anger to her, I feel ashamed from being angry in the first place. She is still with the guy. They seem happy, she seems to have resolved her issues. He's a decent person, but I do not want him in my life. She knows that, but I'm not sure she respects that. Her messages have decreased to maybe once per week? When we are in person, she seems to be trying to stay away. I sometimes approach her, but I am fighting to stay away as well. Still she pings me once in a while, I never initiate. Figure it's for the best.

I got a reel from her last night, I sent her a flame emoji. She liked it. It made me sad honestly. It made me sad that our communication and fantastic connection came down to this. I made the right call in ending it... but man it sucks. She does have good qualities, a lot of them in fact, so I do not want to paint her as some sort of monster. She isn't. But we were not good for each other in the end. She probably changed for 'the right guy'. It just wasn't me.",1,1739794587.0,heartbreak,1,1.0,False

Standing over her was the Eternal - by now she wearing a robe at least -  as well as two medical drones and an older male shaped human. Four-Forty-Five smiled widely and bent down to hug Alia. 



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all right. The doctor says that you overheated from exertion while using Tartarus.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right,‚Äù The doctor said. Alia had noticed that he also had a thick accent, like Viv. He must be using translation softs as well. ‚ÄúIt has been centuries since their use, but the records tell me that the enhancements that you have been supplied as part of Tartarus can only do so much. Periods of extended exertion - or short bursts of extreme exertion - will cause overheating. For now, rest and fluids are all you need, but if you are to be using Tartarus more, we must look into some kind of‚Ä¶ cooling solution. Perhaps a radiator, or a coolant vent.‚Äù



‚ÄúRadiator?‚Äù Alia said aloud, imaging herself with a fin or something sticking out of her head. ‚ÄúNo radiator. We can come up with something else.‚Äù



Four-Forty-Five laughed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd look good with fins,‚Äù she said and sat on the bed next to Alia as the doctor packed up. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt be the first of us with physical mods either. There was a fashion in the mid two hundreds to have body modifications.‚Äù She looked away and was lost in thought for a moment. ‚ÄúCome to think of it, that was the last time Tartarus was popular. It was‚Ä¶ a dark time for us. Perhaps the modifications popular with the two hundreds were more than cosmetic.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure I‚Äôll be all right, doctor?‚Äù Alia asked.



He nodded vigorously, ‚ÄúOh yes, you‚Äôre quite resilient. Like I said, rest and fluids.‚Äù The doctor stood straight, and then genuflected to them both. ‚ÄúUnless you need me further, I will leave you to your recuperation.‚Äù



Four-Forty-Five stood and regarded the doctor, taking a step towards him. Alia saw him stiffen as if he was preventing himself from taking a step back. ‚ÄúYou have helped us greatly, and we do not forget when people assist us - especially when they do it quietly. Keep this up, and you‚Äôll go far, doctor.‚Äù



The doctor nodded and genuflected again. ‚ÄúOf course, Eternal. With your permission I will conduct some research and determine a course of action for-‚Äù He gestured at Alia ‚Äú-Eternal should she wish to pursue more cooling options.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat is an excellent idea. You shall have the access you require.‚Äù Four-Forty-Five looked up and an attendant rushed over. She whispered something to them, and they saluted sharply and led the doctor away.



After they left, Four-Forty-Five shrugged off the robe and crawled under the covers with Alia and snuggled against her, her body chilled compared to Alia‚Äôs. ‚ÄúI told you the bed was comfy.‚Äù She said, smiling. ‚ÄúI just wish you got the chance to try it out under more‚Ä¶ pleasurable circumstances.‚Äù



It wasn‚Äôt so bad, Alia thought. It was a little odd to be cuddling up with herself, but they fit together well, maybe she would- wait. Alia sat up suddenly. ‚ÄúMy crew. What‚Äôs happened to them? They need to know I‚Äôm all right.‚Äù



‚ÄúThey‚Äôre fine.‚Äù Four-Forty-Five yawned. ‚ÄúThey are in my spare rooms, sleeping. After you had passed out, I called for the doctor and explained to them what had happened. Showing them the body of the assassin was an excellent way to gain their trust. They know you are resting and are all right. The hour is late. Let‚Äôs just sleep now, and in the morning you can check in with them.‚Äù Four-Forty-Five snuggled in deeper, and not a minute later, Alia could feel her breathing slow and become regular, falling completely asleep. Alia laid awake in the dark of the room staring up at the ceiling. The adrenaline she received when she was worried about her crew dissipated slowly. The warmth of Four-Forty-Five and her regular breathing was relaxing, and eventually Alia fell into a dreamless sleep.



The next morning, Alia awoke in an empty bed. She sat up - she was also naked, how did she not notice that last night?- and folded neatly at the foot of the bed were another set of clothes. Alia stood and stretched and then pulled them on. For a fleeting moment, Alia wondered how they got her size exactly right and then laughed at herself. Of course they‚Äôd know Alia‚Äôs size. The outfit was nice. It was just a simple shirt and pants in a soft fabric, with bits of gold piping along the seams. She slipped on a pair of slippers next to the bed and padded out into the room.



She found her crew seated in a dining room off the main entrance, eating breakfast. Yel was the first to notice her, and raised an eyebrow at Alia‚Äôs clothes, but said nothing. ‚ÄúGlad to see you‚Äôre up and about, Cap.‚Äù She said. ‚ÄúFood is good, but I‚Äôd expect nothing else for the Eternal. Come eat.‚Äù



Alia made her way over and took the seat at the head of the table. Immediately, stewards appeared from behind doors and placed a plate, cups, silverware, and napkins while another poured coffee and a third placed fruit and a pastry on her plate. Alia didn‚Äôt recognize the fruit, but the coffee was still coffee. The fruit was cold and sweet and had just the right amount of bite, perfectly ripe. She couldn‚Äôt remember the last time she ate food that wasn‚Äôt a meal bar and this might could very well be the best thing she had ever eaten. She was lost in the taste and texture of the food and slowly heard Bric calling her name.



‚ÄúCap? Hello, Cap? Twenty-Seven? Are you all right?‚Äù He said.



‚ÄúOh! Yes, I‚Äôm fine Bric, thank you. I was just‚Ä¶ enjoying my breakfast. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I ate food that wasn‚Äôt in bar form.‚Äù



‚ÄúShe‚Äôs probably also recovering from last night.‚Äù Elia said, and Yel elbowed her. ‚ÄúHey! I meant the assassination attempt.‚Äù She said, frowning.



‚ÄúSure you did, hon. You‚Äôre a terrible liar.‚Äù Yel said.



‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ passed out after Tartarus engaged. The doctor said I overexerted myself and overheated. Four-Forty-Five put me in her bed and I‚Ä¶ we‚Ä¶ slept there last night.‚Äù Alia said. ‚ÄúNothing happened.‚Äù She added, and blushed slightly.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the Eternal‚Äù Ben said, spearing another piece of fruit with his fork. ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt going to judge.‚Äù



‚ÄúAnyway.‚Äù Bric said, side-eyeing Ben, ‚ÄúFour-Forty-Five invited us up to Command. She wants to know where we think James is, and we‚Äôre going to go over there. After, she‚Äôs going to give you Tontine.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat is, so long as you still want it.‚Äù Four-Forty-Five said, as she walked in. Everyone - except Alia - stood as soon as she stepped in, but she gestured lightly and they all sat back down. Eternal was dressed in a white uniform with gold trim, cut in a similar way to a military uniform. She had gold epaulettes and Alia noticed a sidearm on her hip. 



‚ÄúWhat about the rest of my Companions?‚Äù Alia said, as Four-Forty-Five came up along side her. She didn‚Äôt sit. ‚ÄúI still had nearly six hundred in hibernation in Mountain Memories.‚Äù



‚ÄúThey are valuable indeed. It has been a very long time since an Eternal had her own regime of Companions. They are yours, and you shall keep them. We have removed them from your gunship and are in the process of reviving them and‚Ä¶ bringing them up to speed. They will be your team of troops aboard Tontine to use as you see fit. Recent‚Ä¶ changes in the crew means there is more than enough room aboard for them.‚Äù Four-Forty-Five smiled slightly. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be crowded.‚Äù



Alia thought back to the crew being shot by the Mystics and suppressed a shudder.



‚ÄúBefore that though, we have two - three really - pieces of business. First, we are to null over to where James and Halcyon is hiding and remove that threat as a show of goodwill to the Anomoura. Then we will send a beacon and cenotaph to the remains of Greylock as it streaks through this system. It will warn anyone who comes across it that it is a memorial and sacred to us. Finally, we are to take up station around the Anomoura planet.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat are we going to do there?‚Äù Twenty-Seven asked. A steward appeared and went to refill her coffee cup, but Alia put her hand over it, and the steward disappeared.



Four-Forty-Five made a sour face. ‚ÄúWe are to-‚Äù she sighed, ‚Äú-await Eternity herself, Alia Five-Eighty-Seven.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not Eternity?‚Äù Bric said, and as the words left his mouth, Alia noticed all of the attendants and stewards freeze. The words hung in the air, heavily. 



‚ÄúAlia *is* Eternity.‚Äù Four-Forty-Five said after a moment and smiled thinly. Everyone around her took that as a sign, and continued their duties, resuming as if they had been paused. ‚ÄúTwenty-Seven is Eternity, I am Eternity, Five-Eighty-Seven is Eternity.‚Äù She is‚Ä¶ the one who is in charge right now. I am Demi-Eternity when I‚Äôm around her.‚Äù She put her hands on her hips and regarded the companions. ‚ÄúMystics, it‚Äôs been a while since I have been in the presence of people so willing to‚Ä¶ ask questions.‚Äù



‚ÄúI apologize, Eternity.‚Äù Bric said. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ spoke without thinking.‚Äù



‚ÄúIt is all right, you did not know.‚Äù She said. ‚ÄúBut, be aware that once we leave my palace, I am not normally‚Ä¶ questioned. Speak with care, and do not speak to me unless I ask you something. I don‚Äôt particularly mind, but it is against protocol.‚Äù She was still smiling, but Alia saw the hardness in her eyes, ‚ÄúFailure to follow protocol leads to‚Ä¶ chaos.‚Äù Moment over, her eyes softened again. ‚ÄúCome. Let us go to Command and find out what James and Halcyon are up to.‚Äù She gestured to Alia. ‚ÄúBut first, you must get dressed.‚Äù



Alia followed Four-Forty-Five back to the bedrooms as everyone finished eating. In front of the bed were two attendants and another uniform like - but not exactly the same as -  Four-Forty-Five‚Äôs on a hangar. She inclined her head towards them, and Twenty-Seven went over.



‚ÄúArms out, please, Eternal.‚Äù One said. Alia complied and they stripped off her clothes. 



Four-Forty-Five apologized to Alia with her eyes as she stood there being undressed. ‚ÄúThe Eternal is not afforded very much privacy, I‚Äôm afraid,‚Äù She said to Twenty-Seven. ‚ÄúYou will get used to it after a while."" Measurements were taken, and alternations were made to the uniform, and Alia was dressed. The uniform fit her like she was grown into it, but even as she moved, the uniform moved with her, and did not feel constricting or binding. Instead of the pure white of Four-Forty-Fives, this one had a very slight yellow cast. They affixed the sash, and clipped the sidearm to her belt.



‚ÄúIt is part of the uniform.‚Äù Four-Forty-Five said to Alia as she locked eyes with her. Alia took out the pistol. It was very similar to the model she trained on so long ago back on Earth, and felt very familiar in her hands. Quickly she worked the action and a round popped out of the chamber. She caught it before it landed on the ground and pocketed it. Making the pistol safe, she put it back in her holster and looked up again at Four-Forty-Five.



Nodding once, she turned towards the stewards. ‚ÄúShe *is* Eternal, do you not see? Continue the fitting.‚Äù



 It was a test? 



As they exited the palace, and met up with her companions, another pod settled onto the ground in front of them, and once again Four-Forty-Five entered and they followed behind her. This time, the ride was silent, and they arrived in a new section of the ship. 



This looked much more like what Alia was expecting. Long halls, carpeted floors to muffle boots, and sliding pressure sealed doors. They strode down the halls and people moved aside, genuflecting as Four-Forty-Five and Twenty-Seven led, with Alia half a step behind. She wondered as she walked if she could move ahead and if anyone would say anything - she was an original after all - but she assumed that if she did that, Four-Forty-Five would be cross in the bedroom tonight. She did entertain the thought for just a few moments though, and was warmed by the feeling. 



Central Command for *Alternative Solution* was titanic. Almost more like an auditorium than a command deck, it was bustling with activity, with people everywhere. Four-Forty-Five walked to the rear of the room, and a large ornate chair rose out of the floor to meet her. She stepped in, and the lights in the room flared briefly. The chair rose even higher until she was maybe a meter off the floor with a golden dais rising along with the chair. Four-Forty-Five looked down at Alia from the chair, imposing and beautiful. She caught Alias eye and almost quicker than she could notice, she winked. Then, she stood, and got down. ‚ÄúEternal, who was Lost and now is Found, please.‚Äù She gestured to the chair. ‚ÄúLead us.‚Äù
