1h8gh1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1h8gh1o/my_dream_trip_to_australia_became_a_nightmare/,My dream trip to Australia became a nightmare,"I‚Äôm a backpacker. I've been, pretty much all over the world. From the streets of south east Asia to the rolling meadows of western Europe. But there was one spot that had up until recently, eluded me. Australia. Well, I recently bit the bullet and booked my dream trip down under. I'd love to sit here and tell you about how incredible it was. How I saw some of the most amazing sights I had ever seen in my life. To a point I suppose that's true. But I won't be going back there‚Ä¶

You see, I‚Äôve always been fascinated by the idea of the Australian Outback, with its vast empty nothingness stretching as far as the eye can see. Something about getting yourself lost in its beauty, it's equal parts terrifying and exciting. So that‚Äôs exactly what I planned to do. It's also why Australia had remained unattainable to me up until quite recently. I didn't want to do what every dime a dozen tourist did. I had no interest in seeing the sights of the cities, I mean I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre beautiful in their own right, but for me, I wanted to get out into the wilds as quickly as possible.

I did some research beforehand, jumped onto some local Aussie backpacking travel groups on Facebook and I ended up getting quite friendly with a local. His name was Chris and he was part Indigenous Australian. Aboriginal Dad, and his Mother of Irish heritage. We got to talking and upon hearing all about my wishes to see the more secluded sights of Australia, he agreed to be my tour guide for the trip.

Alright! All was set. I flew into Sydney on a cold July morning. Yeah that‚Äôs their winter months down there. I was so excited as the Sydney Harbour bridge and the Opera House slowly came into view as we descended beneath the clouds. I was right, the cities were beautiful in their own regard but still, that‚Äôs not what I was here to see.

I met my tour guide Chris at the airport and we hastily made our way to his vehicle, a stereotypical rusty Holden ute, and began the trek out west. The drive was bloody beautiful and I highly recommend you try it at least once in your lifetime. We eventually cleared the western suburbs of Sydney passing through Parramatta, Blacktown and Penrith before the urban scenery slowly began to give way to beautiful wide open spaces. Yeah, this is what I‚Äôve been waiting for.

The drive continued on for hours as we passed through quaint little outback communities, some of which genuinely looked like ghost towns. It was awe inspiring to see the colours of this barren landscape change as we drove deeper toward the centre. Brown, dry bushland interspersed with pockets of green slowly transitioning into hot red earth. I was mesmerised. It was a long drive out there but I was so captivated by the sights I was seeing I honestly didn't notice. Eventually, just as night began to fall, we reached Broken Hill. This sprawling inland mining city deep in the heart of outback New South Wales was to be our base for exploring the remote wilderness of Mutawintji National Park.

We would stay the night here in Broken Hill. It was too late to start the hike into the park, Chris explained to me. It was already creeping into the afternoon hours, and if we got caught in the dark too far from a good spot to make camp, that could spell real danger out there. I wasn't going to argue. He knew this place better than I did. I was excited to get out there and really start exploring, but I'd also had little sleep on the long haul down here, and I wasn't going to say no to a good night's rest.

We checked into a quaint little hotel. Now, when I say hotel, I mean the Australian depiction of that term. If you're picturing the Hilton, think again. When Aussies say ""hotel"", they mean the bare necessities you need in a room, situated on the second floor on top of a pub (a bar). Falling asleep to the sounds of drunken Australian men shouting at eachother about two different types of football, neither of which I understand, was certainly something. But I was so tired at this point it didn't pose much of a barrier in my journey to slumber. A few pages into a good book and I was out like a light.



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



I awoke the next morning to the smells of breakfast and the sounds of my fellow guests shuffling their way down the stairs to dig into it. I was close behind them, ravenous after not eating very well at all the past couple of days. Aussies sure know how to start the day with a good breakfast. Well, a big one anyway, I don't imagine it would score too high a health rating. Mountains of bacon, sausage and eggs were loaded up onto a plate and I was given a huge mug of coffee to wash it down with. I'm... not really too big a fan of starting the day off with a heavy meal, but I got the feeling I wasn't in the best company to raise any complaints.

After breakfast, I met up with Chris and we loaded our gear into his ute. Before long, we were out on the open road again, surrounded by the endless red horizon. He wasn‚Äôt wrong. This place was remote. It was a few hours drive to the nearest entry point and from there we were on foot. We had everything we needed in our packs but still, there was something quite unnerving about trekking into such a vast open wasteland with not even a vehicle to retreat into should things go sideways. But, this is what I came for. And I was going to see it through.

That first step was something truly magical. The barely audible crunch of the soft top layer of dirt before my boot sunk into the red earth, it was surreal. I had waited so long to see this land, I couldn't quite believe I was actually here. Finally. The first day was full of little moments like that. The first time seeing a mob of kangaroos hop by in the distance. The first time smelling eucalyptus. The first time fearing for my life, as Chris threw an abrupt hand signal up in front of my face just in time to stop me traipsing ignorantly into a large eastern brown snake‚Äôs path. That sure got the blood up. And the first time seeing a billabong cresting the horizon after a full day of hiking, that was a sight to behold.¬†

It was around 4 or 5 in the afternoon by that point, so we decided to make camp for the night. It had been a long day, and I was starving. Thankfully Chris had picked up a few recipes from his old man during his childhood years growing up in a remote outback settlement. ‚ÄúBush tucker‚Äù they call it down there. Chris cooked up a hot stew, and we had that with what they call damper, the ‚Äúbread of the bush‚Äù. It‚Äôs actually really cool to see someone make bread using nothing but ingredients pulled straight from the land. It‚Äôs made using wattleseed and saltbush. It‚Äôs not much for the taste buds, but let me tell you, when you‚Äôre out there with nothing but the clothes on your back and whatever the land grants you, being able to fill your belly with bread is a beautiful thing.¬†

It was a great way to end what had been an amazing start to my first venture into the Australian outback. We set up our camp beneath some gum trees, nearby that beautiful billabong. It was of course far too cold for any swimming but the ambiance was nice. There was a trickle in a nearby stream and the crackle of the campfire had me off to sleep very quickly.

  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



It must have been close to, or maybe just past midnight, when I awoke from a sound sleep, to a hand pressing against my mouth. This is obviously not a great way to wake up deep in the Aussie wilderness and believe me in that moment there were many thoughts of Australia‚Äôs outback serial killers racing through my mind. But as it would happen, it was Chris. His eyes were wide and he had a finger pressed against his lips, telling me in no uncertain terms to keep my mouth shut.

I began to glance around trying to find the source of Chris‚Äôs sudden panicked state. Looking around, at first I didn‚Äôt notice anything, just the vast expanse of the open outback in every direction. Nothing but darkness, and the infinite void of this ancient land. What made this experience even more terrifying is that we didn‚Äôt even have the cover of a tent, we were just camping out rough in our swags. I had no idea what to expect, I had visions of dangerous wild animals hunting us, circling in around us. That‚Äôs when Chris lifted a single hand and pointed down toward the water hole and whispered one word‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúNadubi‚Äù.

It took me a while in my sleepy state to process what I was looking at. In a flash I was reminded of every sleep deprived night spent as a kid after staying up late and watching my Dad‚Äôs scary werewolf films, for that is almost exactly what I was looking at here. It looked in every possible way, bar some subtle differences, like a werewolf. It stood bolt upright on two jagged hind legs, its arms slumped down by its sides and its head hung downward, its scrunched up face moulding into a slender snout which looked more beak-like than that of a dog.

It began to slowly creep around the waterhole, my eyes remaining fixed on it the whole time. With each step the dry earth crunched beneath it, and each one of those sounds will forever remain burned into my memory as with every one of them I thought for sure this thing was making its slow approach towards us. As it came closer to our side of the small pond I began to notice more alarming features about this thing. It may have resembled a werewolf in form and posture but that is where the similarities ended. Its entire body, was covered in what looked to be sharp tendrils, like a porcupine.

I watched as it sniffed at the still night air, I suppose searching for something it could call a meal. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm unsure what its purpose was, what its motives were. But by the look of it neither could have been good. Chris, ever so slowly and carefully, pulled the small swag blanket over the both of us, and we huddled there in place, hoping and praying that we would go unnoticed.

For a series of very, very long hours, we lay there in the silence of the desolate Australian outback, as we listened to this thing take measured paces around our camp. It just, walked around, occasionally sniffing at our packs and some of the food we had left around camp. Intermittently, we would hear the unmistakable sounds of slurping. I guessed at that point it must have found itself some leftovers. Every so often it would retreat back over to the other side of the waterhole, from what we could hear anyway, but would then return. It seemed like it was waiting for something. Perhaps it thought somebody might be coming back, for whatever reason unaware that we were right there beneath the thin swag blanket.

It was, undoubtedly, the single most horrifying night of my life. The thoughts that were running through my mind after seeing this thing. Thinking about what it could do to us with that nightmarish form it carried with it. It was beyond terrifying.

We did not dare move that whole night. And it‚Äôs a good thing! As it would, in the end, be the light of day which would arrive as our saviours. I guess it didn‚Äôt much like the light, or perhaps the early morning heat it brought with it as it made its ascent, as we heard this thing very quickly run away as soon as the morning rays began making their way across our camp.

It still took us another good hour before we could summon the bravery to emerge from our makeshift hiding spot. I almost wish we had not. As we rose from our tiny sanctuary, and got a look at what had once been our tranquil little campsite, we were even more horrified than we had been the night before. We were greeted by the sight of many, many corpses. Lizards, possums, fish, snakes, even some kangaroos. Their bodies, lifeless. Seemingly, they were untouched. You wouldn‚Äôt even know they had been attacked in any way, were it not for the small holes in their bellies, and those disgusting slurping noises we had heard the night before.

We made haste getting out of there, needless to say. We stayed a night back in Broken Hill, and set off for the drive back east the next morning. The drive back to Sydney was a lot more solemn than the one we had taken on the way out there. Chris barely spoke. I almost didn‚Äôt want to break the silence but there were questions on my mind. That thing was obviously not of this world and yet he seemed to know exactly what it was at a glance. While not entirely certain of course, Chris shared with me that what we had seen, was most likely a Nadubi. It is an Indigenous tale of a grotesque, echidna like dog man which hunts by night. I didn‚Äôt get much more out of him, he looked as shaken as I was, understandably so. Despite growing up hearing many of these stories, I could tell by his demeanour this was the first time he had encountered one first hand.

I did end up staying a few more nights in Sydney. Honestly, I was still in a state of shock. I probably would have been on the next flight out had I been in any state of mine to book one. But I just, couldn‚Äôt. So I stuck around, until I could think straight. It wasn‚Äôt all bad I suppose, I ended up seeing a few sights around the city. I have a whole new appreciation for cities. Whilst I do still appreciate the blissful peace of the wilderness, I choose to admire it from afar. I have seen what lurks within the unexplored pockets of the Australian outback. I have seen why so many who venture too deep within fail to return.

For those of you wishing to experience it for yourself, I will not tell you what to do. I will leave you with only one piece of advice. That you educate yourself. Not only by the standards of modern humanity‚Äôs limited knowledge of this land, but listen to the stories of those who have lived here since ancient times. Do not underestimate their wisdom.

1h8ggdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/asustor/comments/1h8ggdm/nimbustor_4_v2_review_dead_board_after_6_months/,Nimbustor 4 V2 Review: dead board after 6 months. Beware 2+ month RMA times!,"I bought the Nimbustor 4 v2 back in April to use as part of a media and game server cluster and I wanted to share my experiences with it as a homelab storage driver. However, after exactly 6 months and a day, it shut off for the last time during my morning coffee while I was setting up AWS backups with Velero (lol).

It's been a month since requesting a RMA, and I wanted to share my experience with support since since I've pretty exclusively had positive experiences with Asus hardware and Asustor is a subsidiary. What I've learned over the past month is that ""Asus subsidiary"" does not mean ""Asus quality customer care.""

* I data on my NAS is for my small business and that I needed to get up and running again ASAP.
* It took 5 days to get through the ""reset the CMOS"" song and dance to get an RMA form.
* Paid the international shipping, about 8% of the retail price. Nbd, but definitely a consideration when hardware doesn't make it past a year.
* It arrived two weeks ago. After 3 days, support shared this with me:

>Yes we received your RMA. We process RMAs by the order they arrive to make it fair. There are curently 4 RMAs in front of yours and due to the holidays this week. things will be pushed back a bit. I will update you when we start on your RMA and give you an estimate on when it will be done.

>Thank you Best regards

Pretty understandable since it got there at the start of Thanksgiving week. I was confused about the specific number of RMAs ahead of mine. My position in the repair queue isn't usually something that's shared with me when I RMA dead hardware. Are they microsoldering it? Is there a single repair technician? Surely it won't take an entire week to repair each NAS.

Fast forward 9 days, no update. I inquire again. Day 11, I get this response:

>We should be starting on your RMA next week and it should be done by the end of next week.

>I will update you when it finishes.

>Thank you Best regards

So it does indeed take Asustor about a week to repair each NAS, and they don't actually have the capacity to do anything but leave your device on a shelf for a week. Now mind you, I asked for a rough ETA because I use this box for my software consultancy and it took a month to find out the repaired box won't reach me until after Christmas at the earliest.

I'll be honest, I'm used to manufacturers who ship out a new device when they receive the defective one. I'm currently evaluating QNAP and AOOSTAR as a replacement to get up and running before 2025. Because let's be real, at this point a no-support Aliexpress crapshoot box has at least the same quality QA and customer care capacity.

Bottom line, I'll be avoiding Asustor like the plague from now on. Not sure why Asus would put their name on this level of customer care.",1,1733532342.0,asustor,0,1.0,False

Vorona is a combat android, with her specific model being the KRH unit or Kampf Reichte Hilfs Einheit (Ranged Combat Auxiliary Unit). Her model of combat android has much more advanced AI‚Äôs than most androids fielded by both the North Atlantic Union and the Eastern Eurasian Federation, however, they are still meant to be disposable and KRH units like her aren't dangerous unless in large numbers of coordinating groups. Because of their advanced AI, KRH units have high rates of gaining consciousness, that is, they essentially gain sentience and the ability to think for themselves. To prevent any conscient KRH units from disobeying orders, a dormant virus is implanted into their AI that will activate as soon as a KRH unit becomes conscient and will slowly take away their memories, eventually reverting them to where they were before they became conscient. However there are cases when KRH units will decommission themselves after gaining consciousness, this usually has to do with a crisis of their own self worth. As many KRH units after gaining consciousness become depressive, either from war and conflict in the Zone or from their conflicting purpose of being disposable and their wishes of being more than that.



Vorona was one such android, but before she could lose her consciousness or decommission herself she would be transferred to a research facility in what once was the city of Warsaw. She became the bodyguard of the only Researcher at this facility, Marie, who was an expert in AI and robotics. Vorona, like many androids who had gained consciousness, was going through a crisis of what she really was, if even she was truly alive. Marie however, embraced Vorona, even giving the name Vorona to the android in crisis. Vorona and Marie would soon become close and vowed to each other. However, their time together was limited and both knew it so. Marie had cancer, and only had a few months to live. And despite Maries best efforts to suppress the virus, it would eventually erase Voronas memories and revert her back to her original status.



Marie and Vorona had made a promise together, to lay each other to rest, they would both end each other before either of them would die alone, or befall a fate worse. Vorona, if she were not to ‚Äúdie‚Äù, would go into a constant cycle of gaining consciousness and becoming unconscious. She would constantly lose her memories over and over again, and eventually forget Marie or their shared love. Marie on the other hand, knew that her intellect had put her in the crosshairs of both the North Atlantic Union and Eastern Eurasian Federation. If either faction got to her, her mind would be used to make a powerful AI that could keep the war within the Zone going indefinitely, rendering Marie's mind unconscious in the process, mindlessly following the orders of whatever faction she was taken by.



Despite this, both Vorona and Marie would continue to cling to life, despite the war and harsh conditions the Zone is known for. They both knew their promise, but both still feared death. They feared the unknowns of it, what would happen to them, or even if they would be forever separated in death. Marie taking cryo rests in a cryopod to delay the cancer, and Vorona attempting to get rid of the virus herself, which ultimately failed. Before Vorona would eventually forget, Marie and Vorona recorded a video together, it was a simple one. Just Vorona and Marie making coffee and hanging out together. The hopes of the video for both of them were that, whenever Vorona regained consciousness and her memories wiped, the video would remind Vorona of Marie. Eventually, Vorona finally lost consciousness, and was shut down for sometime, leaving Marie alone in her cryopod, with one to take her out of it, living but barely. The facility would be eventually taken by North Atlantic Union forces, upon discovering the body of Marie, they promptly set up a station there. Soon enough her mind had been used to create an AI known as Schmetterling, that would continue to wage war within the zone in favor of the North Atlantic Union. Vorona on the other hand, was taken by the North Atlantic union and reprogrammed to serve their forces.¬†



Months later, Vorona would regain consciousness upon a pile of decommissioned KRH units. She had forgotten most of her memories, however, she remembers two things. Her name that was given to her, and the words ‚ÄúA promise, to lay me to rest.‚Äù She would soon be picked up by a man named Sidorovich. Vorona would work for Sidorovich. In exchange Sidorovich would assist Vorona in regaining her memories. Vorona still follows her promise to Marie. Even if Vorona had forgotten her, she still remembers the love and warmth Marie gave her.

  
I really want to expand on this story though, at least try and make it a mini series, expand on the Zone and the factions. Everything really, though at the same time im a lazy bastard so I dont know if im even able to do that, and dont worry, I'll give both Vorona and Marie atleast a bittersweet ending :)

We returned to Nick‚Äôs place. It‚Äôd been a couple of long nights, but things were looking better. The Yearwalker kid was being moved to an apartment complex, where it‚Äôd be easier to keep tabs on him. It‚Äôd give us more time to look towards the real issue ‚Äì Allie. The person, turned thing, turned other thing. Nick and I had an agreement. We‚Äôd deal with this one last problem, and then we were heading to Dallas. Ride off into the sunset.

Maybe it was a stupid plan to begin with. Maybe we were just delaying the inevitable, or moving the goal posts. I knew for a fact that Nick was a bit hesitant about leaving Tomskog to begin with. That town was as much a part of him as his arm, or his pink sunglasses.

But after the setback at Digman‚Äôs ranch, Allie and her cohorts were going to have to lay back for a while and recuperate; if she was capable of making that kind of decision with a conscious mind. That was still up for debate.

¬†

For a couple of weeks, we stayed behind and tried our best to find new leads. We figured there ought to be whispers around the police station, but according to our insider, Charlie, it was business as usual. The only thing that‚Äôd changed was an increased surveillance budget on Digman and his nephew. Not a word about Allie, or the strange people she associated herself with.

It was the beginning of October when Nick came up with an idea of his own. That instead of trying to hunt her down, we could try our best to lure her out. Only problem was ‚Äì he had no idea what we were dealing with. Neither did I, to be honest. Sure, I had an uncomfortable truth of my own hiding in my stomach lining, but I didn‚Äôt understand it. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ having a kidney doesn‚Äôt make me a doctor. It just means it‚Äôs there.

‚ÄúWe should get a hold of that guy again,‚Äù Nick blurted out. ‚ÄúThe tall, weird guy.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt need to say the name out loud. I knew exactly who he was talking about.

¬†

Nick was talking about a guy named Evan. I say ‚Äòguy‚Äô in very loose terms, because there was no telling what kind of creature or identity we were dealing with. ‚ÄòEvan‚Äô, as he was called, was something we‚Äôd run into a couple of times before. He seemed helpful enough when need be, but there was no denying that this was a thing that was far more than human. Or less than, if you prefer. But he might have insights on hunting down Allie.

It wasn‚Äôt that hard to get an idea of his whereabouts. There‚Äôd been a handful of sightings, and Charlie at dispatch had continuous updates whenever something new popped up. Problem was ‚Äì it was all sightings in passing. There was nothing permanent. He was always on the move. Still, we figured he might agree to see us if given the opportunity.

That‚Äôs what we banked on, at least.

¬†

We ran into Evan by mistake. We‚Äôd been driving around checking a couple of locations where he‚Äôd been spotted, and decided to stop for a gas station hot dog and a coffee. There was this old park bench by the side entrance of the gas station where Nick and I sat down, and all of a sudden ‚Äì there was Evan.

It was hard to tell what he looked like. He was like a moving pile of blankets, all haphazardly sown together. It looked more like something you‚Äôd cover your car in to protect it from rain rather than clothes to wear. There was even crime scene tape used to keep it together. The sun had just started to set, casting a long shadow from an already tall man across the table.

He sat down with a thud. Despite me and Nick both sitting on the same side, we could feel the weight shift. This was like sitting face to face with a small car.

‚Äú*Officers*,‚Äù he said.

His voice was an uncomfortable clicking purr ‚Äì like a cat and a centipede had an unfortunate baby.

‚ÄúEvan,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúKeeping tabs on us?‚Äù

‚Äú*Yes*.‚Äù

¬†

There wasn‚Äôt much more to it. I gave Nick a curious look, and he shrugged back at me. This was my show ‚Äì he was just there for the ride.

‚ÄúWe need to find a dangerous woman,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúShe has something terrible inside her, and we need deal with it.‚Äù

‚Äú*Why?*‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúBecause someone needs to. People will get hurt.‚Äù

‚Äú*Yes.*‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt see his face under the layers of cloth, but I could see it tilt to the side. He was listening ‚Äì waiting.

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù I scoffed. ‚ÄúSo we don‚Äôt want that.‚Äù

‚Äú*I don‚Äôt understand.*‚Äù

¬†

Nick put his arms on the table, ready to play the bad cop.

‚ÄúThat bitch was ready to put the teeth to your little Digman guy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSlurp him up like leftover kimchi. If you don‚Äôt want your little pet boyfriend to end up on a Sunday platter, I suggest we work together.‚Äù

‚Äú*What‚Äôs kimchi*?‚Äù Evan asked.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like an old cabbage fist-fighting a radish salad,‚Äù Nick said. ‚ÄúFocus. You helping us or not?‚Äù

‚Äú*Yes.*‚Äù

Nick leaned back with a groan. He gave me a tired look and adjusted his sunglasses. It was my cue to pick up the conversation.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk.‚Äù

¬†

Evan told me there were things he could do to help us find her, but it might be risky. He would need bait, and the best bait around was, sadly, me. I was already infected ‚Äì but it was stable. I could still feel it, and in the moments where my mind drifted I‚Äôd feel little tendrils make their way up my throat; parting my lips. I‚Äôd begun to sleep with a plastic cover over my pillow, or else there‚Äôd be these awful chemical stains in the morning. But this was also what would bring Allie out of hiding ‚Äì the promise of a great meal. But it wasn‚Äôt that easy. Evan had a plan to make me more, as he put it, appetizing. But he warned me ‚Äì it wouldn‚Äôt be pleasant.

A couple of nights later, we drove out to a hill outside of town. It was a starlit night with a swift October chill cutting straight through my jacket. I could feel something inside of me curl into the pit of my stomach, huddling for warmth. Nick and I had to make our way up a slithering gravel path on foot, per Evan‚Äôs instructions.

We found him at the top of the hill with a telescope. If I didn‚Äôt know any better, it almost looked like a picnic.

¬†

‚ÄúWe lookin‚Äô at stars tonight?‚Äù Nick said. ‚ÄúI can spot the big dipper, you know. But it‚Äôs more like a big spoon.‚Äù

‚Äú*No spoons,*‚Äù said Evan. ‚Äú*You. Come here.*‚Äù

He pointed at me. I stepped forward, and he moved away from the telescope.

‚Äú*I need to know how far gone you are,*‚Äù he continued. ‚Äú*Tell me what you see.*‚Äù

I looked back at Nick. He crossed his arms, giving Evan an uneasy look. This was far out of both our comfort zones. Then again, it was just a telescope. Telescopes didn‚Äôt bite.

I walked over and leaned in, making sure not to touch the dials. At first I didn‚Äôt spot anything in particular, but after I found the right angle I could clearly see a celestial body. Something large, and brownish red.

‚ÄúHold on,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIs that Jupiter?‚Äù

‚Äú*What do you see?*‚Äù Evan asked.

¬†

It was a difficult question. As soon as the planet came into focus, my eyes would blur. I‚Äôd have to blink away the moisture. Maybe it was the cold, or maybe it was something different. It wasn‚Äôt just moisture, it was more like tears ‚Äì like my body shivered out of *fear* rather than cold. Stepping away, I took a deep breath. There were lines of tears streaming down my face, but I didn‚Äôt understand why. I sniffled.

‚ÄúYou alright?‚Äù Nick asked.

‚ÄúYeah, I don‚Äôt know why this‚Ä¶ hold on,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThis is weird.‚Äù

I stepped back, looking again. It was clearer now, as if something inside me dared to look a little closer. It was definitely Jupiter, I could see the storms and swirls. But there was something else. Right there, in the middle of it.

‚ÄúIs that an eye?‚Äù

¬†

My stomach turned upside down and inside out. I had a violent physical reaction, falling backwards and heaving out my dinner and lunch into the dry autumn grass. It was nothing like the times I‚Äôd been sick before, this was a single painful cramp-like movement. It felt like the infection inside me was trying to make a run for it, bringing all my organs along. Nick dove forward, checking on me, but I could barely hear him over my own beating heart. Every time I blinked, there was this red discoloration on the inside of my eyelids. A fading image, like I‚Äôd stared at the sun too long.

There was an eye, staring back at me from the inside of my head.

‚Äú*It is an activator,*‚Äù Evan explained. ‚Äú*It is unpleasant.*‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt say anything. My body was a tight knot of cramps and stomach acid. Nick was barking at Evan to do something, but he just stood there. I had this intense shudder coming down my spine in waves with every blink, as if an unheard sound resonated with me.

Then I passed out.

¬†

I woke up in the back of Nick‚Äôs car. Nick and Evan were waiting outside. They looked like they‚Äôd been there for a while. The moment my eyes opened, I had a massive headache. It took me a moment to realize it was from the stench. The entire car had this intense chemical odor. Turns out that thing in my stomach had gone absolutely berserk. Evan and Nick hadn‚Äôt noticed I was awake yet, so I just lay there ‚Äì waiting for my head to stop spinning.

‚Äú*It has progressed*,‚Äù Evan said. ‚Äú*It will progress further*.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs she gonna be okay?‚Äù Nick asked.

‚Äú*She will see a lot of things*,‚Äù he answered. ‚Äú*I will help*.‚Äù

And with that, Evan got up and left. Nick shrugged, as if expecting something more tangible. Then he checked on me, noticing I was awake.

‚ÄúSorry about the car,‚Äù I wheezed.

‚ÄúTell that to Tommy, he‚Äôs the one who‚Äôs gonna fix it,‚Äù Nick sighed. ‚ÄúCome on, you need a shower.‚Äù

¬†

I got back to Nicks‚Äô place, took a shower, and crashed on the couch. It was not just an uneasy sleep; it felt like an uneasy grasp on the world itself. Like I was having trouble differentiating dream from reality, and awake from unconscious. Like the worst fever dream I‚Äôd ever had. I‚Äôd wake up gasping for air, only to realize I was still sleeping. I‚Äôd find myself on my knees in the bathroom, heaving up whatever remained of my stomach ‚Äì and I‚Äôd dream of it, at the same time. I‚Äôd forget where I was, and what I was doing.

Even in my mind, I‚Äôd refrain from looking up. In my half-dream state, I‚Äôd see that red planet when I looked out the window. It‚Äôs as if my eyes were stuck in that telescope, and I‚Äôd see that spot of red in the distance in perfect clarity. And in the middle of it, among the swirling storms, I‚Äôd see that red eye ‚Äì looking at me.

But it wasn‚Äôt just looking at me, it was looking through me. It was concerned. Like a mother hen looking at a child unborn; aching to peck at the broken shell. To help. To plead.

¬†

In the morning, I was sicker than I‚Äôd ever been. I had a fever, and my eyes were swollen. I couldn‚Äôt close them properly. Nick was screaming at someone on the phone one moment and throwing me into a bathtub the next. I remember him apologizing as he stripped me down and covered me in ice water. It was a surreal experience ‚Äì like it wasn‚Äôt really happening to me. It felt more like watching him do it to someone else, but through my eyes. He brought these big bags of ice from the supermarket and poured it all in, but I couldn‚Äôt feel a thing.

I remember looking at him and trying my best to figure out if I was dreaming or not. I couldn‚Äôt raise my hand to poke him on the nose, making me consider that maybe this was real life. Had it been a dream, nothing could‚Äôve stopped me.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what that fucker says,‚Äù Nick said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one bad cough from an ambulance.‚Äù

I finally managed to move my hand, touching his nose with a ‚Äòboop‚Äô. It felt like the air itself was jelly.

‚ÄúPerv,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a perv.‚Äù

Nick buried his face in his hands. I almost recognized it as relief. Maybe I was getting better.

¬†

At some point, I fell asleep, but I was still in that room. Nick was gone, but the room remained. The light was different. There was a hole in the wall, and strange trees outside. Evan was there, leaning against a broken doorway. There was an eerie silence in the air, like there was supposed to be crickets outside ‚Äì but there weren‚Äôt.

‚ÄúThis is what remains of somewhere else,‚Äù he said.

His voice was different. Smoother, almost human. He was a bit smaller, and dressed in a poncho rather than a makeshift blanket fort.

‚ÄúYou can come and go as you want?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúOr are you from here?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere is a lot of me to go around.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fucked up.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

¬†

I looked out the crack in the wall. A starlit night. I knew the red planet was out there. The red eye. I felt my stomach acid swirl.

‚ÄúNormal people don‚Äôt see it,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúBut those who do see it a lot.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt feels like it‚Äôs alive,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI hate it.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is worried about us,‚Äù Evan said. ‚ÄúThinking there is something wrong.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs there?‚Äù

Evan took a few steps forward, leaning out through the crack in the wall. The texture of the ceramic tiles looked different. Older.

¬†

‚ÄúImagine the egg of a bird,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut it takes longer to hatch than it should. And finally, it moves. But you are not seeing the feathers. No beak. You start to worry if your egg is the bird you expected.‚Äù

‚ÄúSnakes lay eggs too,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd turtles.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr maybe the egg is dead,‚Äù Evan said. ‚ÄúMaybe something else lives in there.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd be worried too,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSo what exactly are we in this metaphor. Are we the egg, or what‚Äôs inside?‚Äù

‚ÄúNeither,‚Äù said Evan. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre what lives in the bumps in the shell.‚Äù

‚ÄúEgg shells don‚Äôt have bumps. They‚Äôre smooth.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot if you look close enough.‚Äù

¬†

I got out of the bath. The water was long gone. It was a pleasant night ‚Äì not too cold, not too warm. I joined Evan at the crack of the wall, looking out. In the distance, there was a tree. It was larger than anything I‚Äôd ever seen. Tall enough for the branches to reach the sky, as if trying to pluck the moon like low-hanging fruit.

Except it wasn‚Äôt a tree. It was a muscle, with branches being white, living tendrils. A smell tickled my nose ‚Äì the same smell I‚Äôd felt back in the car. My smell. Veins as wide as highways. Cuts and bruises as tall and wide as parking garages. Every heartbeat sending pulses of blackened blood, as thick as waves on an upwards ocean. It never stopped moving. Squirming. *Reaching*.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs nothing,‚Äù Evan said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Blameless.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not nothing,‚Äù I gasped.

‚ÄúPerhaps there‚Äôs a good reason to worry.‚Äù

Something inside me resonated with that thing. I could feel how satisfied it was. It‚Äôd wanted this; to become something whole. It wanted to bring it all together. It wanted to reach through the cracks in the shell. It wished for it. It wished for it every moment, of every day.

A wish upon a red, weeping star ‚Äì desperate to look the other way.

¬†

I woke up screaming. I‚Äôd crawled out of the bath, curled up into a corner, and clawed at the walls like a cornered animal. Nick had wrapped a blanket around me and held me like a child, shushing me. His arms were stained with acid burns, and there were spots of his blood on the walls. And yet, there he was.

Exhaustion took hold as my lungs gave out. I couldn‚Äôt scream anymore, and settled into a forced, wheezing breath.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright,‚Äù Nick whispered. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake. It‚Äôs okay.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt speak. I could feel that muscle in the dark space beyond. Clawing at the world, begging to reach through. And there were so many things looking to help. I could feel them everywhere ‚Äì inside and out.

That‚Äôs what Allie would want, given the Yearwalker‚Äôs wish. A slip of the red eye, and a wink at something aching to break through. Something horrifying, but Blameless, through countless worlds beyond.

How could I do anything but scream?

¬†

I blinked in and out of consciousness. I dreamt of splinters of worlds long dead. Fields of blue sunflowers hiding little houses of lies and flies.

I saw people dancing around a winter lake, singing in forgotten tongues. The circle of dance a symbol for the yearly trot of the Earth around the Sun. It was a way to speak a word in a manner that something impossible could understand ‚Äì and the word not spoken was ‚ÄòWish‚Äô.

I‚Äôd see struggles and pain, screams and desperation. Empty people bringing silence. Thousands of lives, all at the same beach of black sand at the end of hope and things undone. Cruelty at every turn, at every corner. Uncaring, inhuman, and true.

And through it all; inevitable pain and darkness. Except for a single voice, in the back of my mind. Something warm stroking my sweat-soaked hair, whispering.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be okay.‚Äù

¬†

When my eyes opened, I was in a warm bed. I was looking up at the ceiling as the morning light broke through a hazy window.

I felt something in my stomach. A resignation. The thing inside me had fought to take control, but it‚Äôd failed. Like the lady in the blue kaftan had said, it wouldn‚Äôt be the death of me. She‚Äôd been right. Instead, it lingered ‚Äì like a wild animal cowed to submission.

I looked at my hand, willing a single white strand to protrude from my fingernail. It did, without protest. Control at last.

¬†

Nick was off in the corner, sleeping on a desk chair. He was gonna have a stiff neck, he was leaning at a really bad angle. He‚Äôd bandaged both his arms, and there were spots of red breaking through the fabric. I sat up. My clothes had been washed and dried. They were on the floor right next to me.

I could tell there‚Äôd been a struggle. There were buckets of something foul-smelling by the side of the bed. Several towels, all stained with blue. Empty plastic ice bags. There were a couple of belts on the floor ‚Äì maybe Nick had to restrain me at some point.

I sat up. My hands were shaking. My body was so empty of nourishment that I was afraid to think of food. It felt like a hearty meal would hurt.

¬†

‚ÄúYou good?‚Äù

Nick looked up from his chair. He winced a little as he uncrossed his arms.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSorry about-‚Äú

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not talk about this,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù

Nick got up and walked over to the door. He was gonna give me some privacy, but just as he closed the door, he turned back to me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a goddamn perv,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúYeah you are,‚Äù I scoffed back.

‚ÄúOkay, you‚Äôre good,‚Äù he sighed. ‚ÄúFucker.‚Äù

¬†

Apparently, Evan had mapped out what was going to happen to me to the best of his abilities. It was a lot worse than he‚Äôd anticipated though. There‚Äôd been talk about a fever and uncomfortable dreams, but I‚Äôd been kicked around worse than Evan had thought possible. Nick had been on the brink of getting me to a hospital, but that would‚Äôve been a one-way ticket bay to a Hatchet facility.

After a couple of days of recovery, I was back on my feet. I could‚Äôve eaten a goddamn horse. I felt better than I‚Äôd done for months ‚Äì like I was finally fully in control. I was still a bit hesitant about going to sleep, but that was more psychological than anything. I felt like a part of me understood something that the rest of me didn‚Äôt, and it made me uncomfortable. With a little bit of time, I was sure it‚Äôd settle down.

¬†

We made it back to the top of that hill. It was a calm October afternoon, but the wind remained. Evan was nowhere to be seen. Nick was religiously chewing gum. Turns out it was nicotine gum ‚Äì he was quitting smoking. A new start.

‚ÄúYou still wanna do this?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúWe can just go to Dallas.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf she gets the Digman kid, it‚Äôs gonna be bad,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúReal, real, bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat bad, huh?‚Äù

He picked up a rock and flicked it down the hill, like he was skipping it across a lake. There was a thump as it smacked against a log.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôd kill a lot of people,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what it wants.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo let‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ let the DUC deal with it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have to be us.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù I sighed. ‚ÄúBut do you wanna risk it?‚Äù

¬†

He picked up another rock, throwing it with the same flick of the wrist. Despite being thrown at the same power, and angle, it hit something else. Nick nodded at me.

‚ÄúYou scared the shit out of me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI was having a bad time.‚Äù

He gave me the most obvious ‚Äòno shit‚Äô-look I‚Äôd ever seen and turned his attention to finding another rock.

‚ÄúSo you figured her out yet?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúSort of,‚Äù I sighed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a lot.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know where she‚Äôs at?‚Äù

¬†

I was going to say ‚Äòno‚Äô, but for some reason, I didn‚Äôt. Instead, I listened. I *forced* myself to listen. I took the reins. I imagined that distant red eye in the sky, and I listened to all the little heart beats shivering under its gaze. The sound they made was colder than the October wind, like little nails running through my skin, pulling at me.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs north.‚Äù

Nick didn‚Äôt question it. He could tell I needed a minute, so he just gave me a pat on the back and made his way back down the hill.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll get the hunting rifles,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis, then Dallas.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis, then Dallas.‚Äù

¬†

He left me alone for a bit, leaving me to my thoughts. The world felt so frail, like a shivering egg. A firm push at the wrong angle, and something would break. We‚Äôd puncture the yolk.

I could see why they all wanted the Yearwalker dead. There was too much at stake.

And maybe we‚Äôd have to make some difficult choices.",1,1733531932.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1h8g8ld,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1h8g8ld/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke. It was our song remastered",1,1733531710.0,Tik_tok_stories,0,1.0,False

The only thing worse than missing Mr. B? Being stuck with Mr. T.

Yes, I know. Crass. But it‚Äôs true. I‚Äôm (literally) counting down the hours until my flight tomorrow at 2 p.m. If you‚Äôve been keeping up, you already know why.

During this purgatory, let‚Äôs call it the¬†e*ra of Waiting,*¬†Mr. B decides to text me. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing this Tuesday?‚Äù We all know it‚Äôs a booty call. But because it‚Äôs Mr. B, and because we haven‚Äôt officially started no-contact yet, I cave. Of course I cave.

I tell Mr. T I‚Äôm leaving. He doesn‚Äôt ask many questions. If you happened to be at the Regis bar on Tuesday night, you probably saw me and Mr. B pounding cosmos and crying. Both of us. Tears, cocktails, and divorce despair‚Äîwhat a combo.

Mr. B puts his hand on my knee. ""I love you, you're my person. I just need some time."" 

""I just want to be allowed to come home."" I say ""I don't care if home is the Regis or a trailer park, what matters is that you are there and I am allowed there."" 

""Allowed is a hard word."" We both pause. He finishes, ""The right word."" I shoulder check him to relieve tension and he says, ""if it helps, I won't get a dog without you."" It does help, a little, but I just put my forehead against his and close my eyes. I try to memorize how it feels to love someone this much and he whispers ""you made me believe in soulmates."" 

I think the whole scene probably looks silly to the rest of the bar, him in his black button up, dark grey wool coat, beard and aviator sunglasses with his forehead pressed against a blonde girl half his age, but neither of us care. We are lost in each other. 

Fast forward: Mr. B absolutely¬†*destroys*¬†my neck. I‚Äôm talking hickeys of biblical proportions. Now, keep in mind, I‚Äôm paper-white, and Mr. B showed zero mercy. By the next morning, I‚Äôm borderline purple. Cue a mad dash to Sephora, where I grab everything concealer-related within reach. But it‚Äôs bad.

Meanwhile, Mr. T and I have reached a sort of unspoken truce. Yesterday, I caught him with his Seeking tab open, so... yeah. Mutual understanding, no questions asked.

Related: I‚Äôve spent¬†*days*¬†ransacking Mr. T‚Äôs house for anything processed. The man doesn‚Äôt even allow cow‚Äôs milk because of its ‚ÄúAmerican processing methods.‚Äù It‚Äôs all goat‚Äôs milk (??) So, in desperation I have  called upon the ghost of his ex-girlfriend: ‚ÄúGuide me to your stash.‚Äù I have whispered in times of need. 

Today‚Äîvictory. Hidden behind a mountain of tampons, I found a tub of icing and some chips. My salvation. So while I munch on the forbidden goods, I plan out this M/G with Guy-from-reddit. That's right. A local, right here from SLF ;).

Oh.

More handsome than his photos. More put together. Confident. Witty. He takes both my hands in his, makes a joke, and I laugh (despite myself).

I make a box of pomegranate tea interesting. Study the shape. The colors. It‚Äôs too soon. I blush. Can he see it? God, I hope not.

‚ÄúWhat will my initial be?‚Äù he asks, half teasing. I hesitate. I don‚Äôt want to give him one. Slapping an initial on him feels reductive.

‚ÄúI like Mr. R,‚Äù he says, unprompted, with a smirk.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúMr. R it is.‚Äù

We talk. I laugh‚Äîtoo much, probably. More than I have in months. He‚Äôs feels so *familiar.*¬†Handsome, sweet, charming in a way that doesn‚Äôt feel performative. When I blush again, I don‚Äôt care if he notices.

Then it‚Äôs time to leave. I have to get back to Mr. T. I walk him to his car and think, for a fleeting moment, about holding his hand. But I don‚Äôt. He wants to kiss me. I can feel it. My body screams *kiss me kiss me kiss me* but I can't. Not with Mr. B unresolved. A man like him deserves everything. 

When I return home, I feel... confused. A little lost. Unsure about Mr. R, but curious. Unsure what Mr. B will choose to do if I stay silent and way. So curious. What happens next? I don‚Äôt know.",0,1733531184.0,sugarlifestyleforum,0,0.5,False

I was diagnosed with pcos when I was in middle school.

During the pandemic, i was able to lose weight because i fought through the fatigue *eating carbs during the day* and used all my energy to fight off hunger *due to increased insulin levels/insulin resistance.

I lost 60 pounds (130 pounds was the lowest i weighed in 2022) but didn't manage to keep it off long before I gained 50 back (currently 180 pounds).

I'm trying again but since there's no pandemic, I have to go to school and work while fighting fatigue and hunger.

Is there any medication I can ask for from my primary Healthcare provider that helps with these symptoms.

When I go vegan, it helps. However, I can't eat carbs until nighttime or else I get drowsy and I'm cold all the time. And I don't want to drink coffee because I can't fall asleep.

I'm 22 now and 180 pounds :( and 5' 4""

Please let me know :)

I have my doctor's appointment on Tuesday and I want to come with some medication suggestions.

I absolutely love the social sim aspect and just living a mundane daily life as a Japanese high schooler lol. It's such a vibe, as the kids say, to wander around Tokyo streets and back alleys, make some coffee at Leblanc, study at the school library or go hang out with my friends. Add in the fantastic music, and there's just such a cozy relaxing atmosphere to the game that I love spending time in.

I'm looking for something else that'll give me that same mood and vibe. I don't want to jump into Persona 3 or 4 because I think I'll just get burnt out on the series playing *that* much Persona.

So is there any other game or series that can give me the same ""feel""? As far as combat goes, I'm good either way. It can have it, and that's cool but if it isn't there, I won't be too bothered. ",3,1733530997.0,ShouldIbuythisgame,3,0.8,False

Magical or physical, I adore it to pieces. Especially in cases where the FL is actually *stronger* than the ML, which as we all know is rare enough in this genre.

I was reading one of them recently, and I stumbled across this one scene, which immediately turned me off the entire work. Petty? Maybe. I was actually surprised at just how extremely off-putting I found this particular situation and how all my interest just died in an instant.

You've probably seen it before: Powerhouse FL comes across an unpleasant or annoying situation but because of being OP, it's not a big deal (sometimes FL even does this stuff as a job, depending on the story). She takes care of business in flash, because she's done so 100 times before and it's really not a problem, but because there was a slight chance FL could have broken a nail or gotten a scratch, ML FREAKS THE FUCK OUT. 

Starts berating FL like a goddamn child, because this thing, that she knows how to do and has done 100 times before could have potentially, maybe, plausibly caused her mild physical discomfort, and how can she care so little about her safety, when Duke Dingus McDingDong is ready to throw himself on the nearest sword to prove his 'love' for her, despite having the motor skills of a drunk toddler in comparison?

That's bad enough already, but can be salvaged, depending on how FL handles it, right?

But then comes the part that completely slays all hope for me: Powerhouse FL has a fucking 'epiphany' and realizes how 'selfish' she's been by having confidence in her own skills, with the experience of a lifetime or five to back it up. How 'sweet' and 'caring' the ML is being by talking to her like a complete idiot, because he 'cares' about her getting hurt, just not about supporting her and believing in her skills. 

I'm absolutely fine with stories where a character is called out for being completely reckless, when there's no real need for them to be, they don't have the power to back it up and/or it could end up creating a huge mess, that's all perfectly valid. I also get the ML showing genuine concern, and expressing it in a vulnerable manner. However, I would love more OIs where the ML actually believes in FL's skills instead of constantly trying to deny or minimize them.

Give me more ""Bae's got this, I'm going for a coffee"" and less ""How could you even think about risking getting a splinter? I'm gonna have to lock you up until you think about your actions, young lady!""",12,1733530719.0,OtomeIsekai,5,1.0,False

So... Trying to keep this shit straight and sanity check myself. Writing this after a pretty weird incident that happened earlier tonight after an absolutly wild phone call yesterday. 

I 34m met a guy Aaron 29m on tinder last month. He was super eager to meet up from jump and I hadn't had other plans so decided to just meet for coffee and see what happened. We came from the same industry and knew a bunch of same folks. 

Just for context I'm first nations indigenous living in the UK and am admittedly a bit on the ostentatious side, hopefully this helps for context/tone.

The first date went well enough that we worked out time to hang out and watch a mutual fave film. I'm normally not prudish but literally out of no where he went to make a move.  There was something in it that didn't sit right. I'm sure folks know when the energy is just ... Off.  I texted my roommate to have her call me and say there was an emergency and I scuttled out pretty quickly.  

Then we start what was a near constant Aaron initiated texting thing where Aaron started using words like ""our relationship"" or ""this relationship"". Just from life/work circumstances I was stupidly and am stupidly overwhelmed and admittedly wasn't super aware of his red flag parade as I should have been. That is 100% on me. I absolutely needed to set clearer boundaries. 

I let him know I needed to take a step back and focus on work / shit with my cat kids, my beautiful cat son passed like two weeks ago and it's been so rough on me and the other fluffy kiddos.  Anyway.  Idk how he wormed his way back into my life but he asked to come over for night of junk food and conspiracy theory debunking with a few friends of mine. Totally worn down I stupidly agreed and regretted it almost instantly. I continued to regret it literally  every second of that night and what it lead to. He acted... Odd‚Ñ¢ but not like super out of pocket for a white kid, I figured he was just nervous lol  

After that my work picked up like crazy and I got to a point of so busy in my studio that I left the house for the first time today in two weeks. So maybe five days ago I get a call from him about how I'm not emotionally attentive enough for him in this relationship. Again that word about a relationship that hasn't been established. It was so exhausting and I was trying to work while he rambled he asked to come over and just hang out in the studio. Stupidly I relented.  It was supposed to be an hour max ... He didn't leave for 6 hours.

So that night turned in to a night of emotional pain lol. Aaron managed to find some unhinged guy on YouTube who thought Newfoundland and specifically the local indigenous peoples held a secret key to hollow earth.  As this unhinged mess got started Aaron was giddy that I knew where it was going before it ever got there. Like he was so chuffed that I was able to puzzle  shit out before he could.

Let's be real that's not impressive it's pointing at a dumpster fire in the street.  This wasn't subtle.

I warned him several times that this is about to get even more racist and really dark... really fast. He refused to listen and begged me to watch a few more minutes for a really funny bit coming up. Well what was in the interim was a crew illegally excavating a site of unmarked graves from one of the residential schools. At that point I just... I couldn't breathe I was just frozen trying not to cry and this guy got it but didn't..he saw that I was hurt but still wouldn't go after I had tried to wrap shit up and get him out the door several times so I could meet my deadlines. He didn't understand so I tried to explain the basic rundown of what happened in residential schools while I'm already  triggered as hell and how that is my history as well, my grandmother was a survivor of St Anne's, this is not an abstract concept for me.

Eventually he left.. finally. He tried to invite himself to stay over. That was amazing.  I was so shaken.

Then Tuesday, he texts me that he needs to call.and it's serious.  I put him on speaker with my BFF listening and he starts with a massive apology on the conspiracy video shit and said they really didn't understand about anti indigenous racism. Okay. Fine. Great. Cool guy. Good for you.   

This ended up being a three hour conversation of me trying to explain that I am not comfortable or okay and him totally ignoring me. It ended up with him snapping at me after shouting ""don't you want a person that makes you feel good?!"" Oh.. oh.. no.. he said some pretty foul shit that implied him using people and intimate relationships as stims, that ""it's better than someone  doing drugs, right?"" But here's where my alarm bells went screaming. He's dated several ftm/afab trans masc or intersex dudes. I'm intersex...  The statistics of that happening randomly are so slim to none that I am seriously on edge.

Yeah. So I push to end that conversation real quick and thought I was done at that point.  And now cut to why I'm bringing this to reddit. 

Went to a yearly event that Aaron absolutely did not know about that consisted of mostly elder millennials/x'er goths reliving the glory days... And there he was. Just watched me. Didn't say anything. Just kept staring at me without engaging. 

I hadn't posted anywhere that I was going nor did I tell him or really anyone that I had intended on going at all. So I'm fuckin spooked. He knows where I live lol do I move? How do I get this dude out of my life?

Thoughts?   

Sorry for the novel, I'm still omw home and trying not to over think this.

1h8fro9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlieTheTraveler/comments/1h8fro9/portugal/,Portugal,"Below is an article I wrote in which I explained where in Portugal I think you should visit, how much time I think you should spend at each of these recommended destinations and the order in which to visit these destinations. Feel free to direct message me if you need help.

Characterized by its distinct architecture, dotted with medieval castles, and quintessentially Southern European villages - home of diverse scenery featuring shoreline resorts that attract families and partygoers alike, and also boasting exceptional cuisine and wine, Portugal presents a great variety of attractions. Aside from the quality vineyards and wonderful weather, perhaps the country‚Äôs greatest allure is its nature. Even the more touristy destinations usually provide easy access to unspoiled landscapes: a dramatic coastline, beautiful beaches, striking coves and cliffs, lush valleys and forestry, dazzling fields of flowers, and wild rivers.

**Day 1:** Start your trip to Portugal in **Porto** and sleep in this city tonight. If you arrive in the morning, then today you should make a **daytrip** via a 1.5-hour drive to the **Douro Valley**. This is a world-famous wine region. The highlights are the vineyards, wineries, and boat ride along the Douro River.

As for Porto itself, I am somewhat hesitant to recommend it. From across the river, the port and the surrounding areas look just fabulous. Once you navigate through the streets and squares, however, Porto appears to be a bit dirty and unpreserved. If restored and beautified, the city itself could easily become a tourist destination in its own right, not least considering there are major landmarks worth seeing. Most people simply walk in and around the port and call it a day. For those who wish to explore Porto in more depth, you will need two full days. Below are the names of the attractions I recommend you visit should you decide to explore Porto in depth.

**Day 2**: Relocate via an early-morning, 1.5-hour train ride from Porto to **Coimbra**.

Best known for its university and the festive student life, yet capital of Portugal from the twelfth to the thirteenth century, Coimbra is graced with Romanesque and gothic buildings and a maze of medieval streets today. Although in need of further restoration, Coimbra is arguably Portugal‚Äôs most picturesque town. The nicest views are of University Hill, seen from across the Mondego River. Coimbra is the kind of place that exudes much youthful spirit and atmosphere.

**Day 3**: Starting today, you will need a car rental to be dropped off in Lisbon, or the Algarve region if you decide to travel this far south. Take a 1-hour drive from Coimbra to **Fatima**. This small town is a site of pilgrimage specifically due to reports of apparitions of the Virgin Mary. Sleep here tonight. Spiritual events take place most evenings.

Fatima is very dear to me. It was one of a few apparition sites I visited following my brain surgery when a cancerous tumor was removed. Upon arrival, I instantly felt very a strong and soothing spirit surrounding me. It all sounds like nonsense for the average non-believer until you ate actually in Fatima. If you end up going, I can almost promise you will not regret it.

**Day 4**: Although Lisbon is your final destination for tonight, there are many worthwhile places to visit en route. Firstly, take an early-morning, 1.5-hour drive from Fatima to the coastal town of Peniche. There you should go on an organized, half-day boat tour to the **Berlengas Natural Reserve**. It is only a 30-minute boat ride away from Peniche. The reddish and orange rocks and green waters complement each other nicely. Upon your return to Peniche, check out the fortress.

Next, take a 1-hour drive to the village of Mafra. There you will find an overwhelmingly grand palace-monastery called **Mafra Palace**. Next, take a 30-minute drive to **Sintra**. Once the Moorish lords‚Äô summer residence and later serving a similar purpose for Portugal‚Äôs kings, today this dreamlike destination is home to two opulent palaces, several affluent private estates, and stunning castle remains. What‚Äôs more, the scenery surrounding the town is lush while the views are absolutely breathtaking. Although the town of Sintra is small, its UNESCO World Heritage Sites are undoubtedly grand.

Next, take a 15-minute drive to **Cascais**. While the town itself is charming enough, the beaches still are the main draw. If you do not wish to go for an early evening swim, at least you could have dinner in Cascais. After your meal, take a 45-minute drive to Lisbon.

**Days 5-7**: Explore **Lisbon**. 3 days suffice.

Numerous and picturesque vistas overlook a relatively compact historic center of fascinating landmarks, red rooftops, uphill streets, and nostalgic-looking tramways in a city that has been on the tourist radar for a long time now. Lisbon is almost equally popular for its romantic and traditional restaurants, thriving nightlife, and not least, surrounding beaches. The ideal waterfront location, balmy climate, and laid-back atmosphere give tourists that much more reason to visit.

1h8fpis,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h8fpis,First Time Overnighter,"So I‚Äôve been planning to make a trip to Korea in the future and then decided I‚Äôd better do a couple of overnighters first to really home in on what gear I needed to make the trip. So once I locked in some time off, I decided to do a solo overnighter to Labuan, Malaysia. 

I decided to bring my C-Line in an Ikea Dimpa with a diy cardboard base as I would be using a car to the ferry terminal. Used a repurposed camera bag for my clothes and a powerbank (stupidly decided not to pack a charging plug) and decided to just YOLO it from there. 

Arriving in Labuan, off the boat in the afternoon was a bit of a shocker for me, the place seemed to be a bit more run down than I remembered since my last visit a decade ago. 

Anyway I unpacked and rode off the 1km or so to the motel and checked in to a room which was bare, but clean. 

Rain meant that I had to wait, but I managed to get a ride in to Peace Park, arriving back to the motel just after sundown. 

Next morning, I set off on my ‚Äútourist ride‚Äù, aiming for the waterfront, WW2 War Memorial and the Chimney Museum. And realised my powerbank had dropped charge from 50%-0%. 

Hmm not good. Especially as I needed navigation. 

Riding there and back would be a hilarious journey of stopping at major intersections and fiddling with turning on and off maps, locations services and screen brightness to conserve battery. 

I also did not have any phone mount and I had only a shoulder bag makeshift strapped to my handlebars meaning I had to fumble with unstrapping, navigating on the phone and restrapping the bag to my handlebars..

It got to the point where posted traffic police took pity on me and kept traffic flowing along my direction until I was done and rode across the major intersections before allowing cross traffic to resume. Happy times.. 

Riding without bottle bags was also interesting, luckily I was using a cycle jersey so stuffing 2 drink cans in my jersey pockets would have to do. 

Coming back in the heat of mid-morning would also be interesting and I opted out of returning via the coastal road I used earlier, instead opting to ride inland in case I needed food or water. And found out that the road shoulder was wider on the inland roads. Go figure‚Ä¶scenery and no road shoulder or nothing to see and road shoulder. 

Labuan has aged, a lot. Most of the attractions were there, just‚Ä¶aged or run-down. Galleries were ‚Äúunder maintenance‚Äù and I could only take external photos. COVID really took a toll on the tourism sector there. The shift of O&G towards Sarawak has also contributed in part to this decline; as I gathered via some small talk with a coffee shop owner there. 

So.. leaving the motel during peak hour was also interesting. Opting out of riding in peak hour single lane traffic, I made the executive decision to carry the Brompton nearly 1km.. with my luggage bag‚Ä¶ with my shoe bag & helmet‚Ä¶ in typical SEA midday heat. 

In hindsight I should have unfolded and just rolled the bike to the ferry terminal. Lesson well learnt! 

Food options were also interesting. Being that I was travelling solo, I had to opt out of trying certain restaurants as I knew I would not be able to try as much variety of food as I wanted; it was then I really appreciated that travelling in pairs does make being able to try more varieties of food per meal easier. In this trip, I opted out of Chinese ala-carte seafood or Western for Thai one-dish meals instead. 

‚ÄúIs that a bicycle?‚Äù 

Crossing immigration & customs control would also be interesting. Typical travellers were O&G offshore workers, partygoers‚Ä¶. business travellers‚Ä¶ and then there‚Äôs this one guy lugging a helmet, and a foldable bicycle in an Ikea bag. Customs control officers were quite interested, asking what it was and how heavy, lugging the Brompton to feel the heft.. but all good. 

So‚Ä¶ there we go. My first YOLO solo overnighter. I really need to get a phone mount‚Ä¶and remember to bring a charging plug‚Ä¶and get a bottle bag‚Ä¶ and a proper front bag or basket which allows unhindered access. :) ",4,1733530126.0,Brompton,0,1.0,False

1h8foro,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1h8foro/well_water_part_1/,Well Water (Part 1),"***One:***

An awful, ungodly stench struck Charlie the moment he opened the creaking front door of the nearly abandoned apartment complex. He winced, reflexively jerking his face away from the entryway so that his lungs might find new air. The thief‚Äôs chest audibly rattled as he voraciously sucked in the atmosphere outside the doorway, hand still gripping the brass doorknob. Curious, Theo leaned into the building, inhaling a sample of the escaping vapors. With a chastising shake of his head, he exhaled, chuckling as he did. The younger of the two thieves ducked under Charlie‚Äôs arm and pushed forward, seizing the opportunity emasculate his colleague‚Äôs fragile sensibilities - teasing him for being so dumbstruck by an aroma. However, Theo‚Äôs chronic sinusitis had diminished his sense of smell, unbeknownst to his older colleague. So, despite Theo being able to detect the potent aroma, it was unable to restrain him like it did Charlie.

Theo admired Charlie as a mentor and felt a hint of jealousy towards him, so he found satisfaction in having something to hold over his head. His untimely demise in one of these flats would prevent Theo from ever disclosing this admiration.

‚Äú*C‚Äômon now, old man. No time to stop and smell the roses,*‚Äù Theo mocked, now leisurely strolling down the narrow, dimly lit lobby.

He wanted to move himself along, imaging himself running ahead to overtake Theo. But Charlie could not force his body through the partition and further into the corrosive scent, the intensity of which continued to increase as more stale air poured from the dilapidated building. Charlie struggled to identify what exactly could produce such a foul odor. It was acrid and gamey, reminiscent of meat spoiled in the summer sun; but at the same time, it also had a metallic and artificial quality, similar to the inside of a bustling factory. Stagnant, putrefied water closely resembled the stench, he considered, but it didn‚Äôt quite match.

Instead of following Theo in, Charlie raised a defiant middle finger as he bent over to retrieve the Vicks Vaporub from his backpack. From somewhere further down the hallway, he heard his partner flippantly squawk about Charlie‚Äôs feminine constitution. As he listened to the continued goading, Charlie could not fathom how Theo had developed such a bravado. The man was nearly as broke as he him, he had no girlfriend, and he carted around a body shaped like a neglected pear, one that had sat in the fruit bowl for a few too many days - rotting and sagging in all the wrong places. With Theo somehow¬†*still*¬†chattering on, Charlie sighed and smeared the waxy material over the crest of his upper lip as a barrier against the assaulting odor.

He wasn‚Äôt much better in comparison, though, Charlie lamented to himself. Gaunt and skeletal, he stood at a monstrous six foot seven inches. Though potentially commanding, his great height was offset by a total absence of muscle. Last time he checked, his weight clocked in at just shy of one hundred and twenty pounds. If Theo resembled a decaying pear, Charlie embodied an anemic popsicle stick. Perhaps, he mused, he and Theo were actually a perfect match - both objects that had well outlived their usefulness and only truly belonged at the heart of a landfill.

He at least possessed some companionship, he reflected, however meager it may be. Charlie could not stand the notion of being truly, utterly alone. He had grown to avoid it at all costs.

Protected from the disabling scent, Charlie took a beat to more thoroughly survey the street. Not that there was that much to see. The area was completely deserted and dilapidated, devoid of any sign of human habitation. That wasn‚Äôt always the case, though. Lutzwater boulevard used to represent the cornerstone of the city‚Äôs downtown, with this apartment complex acting as the linchpin that held it all together. Charlie relocated from the suburbs to the city at age ten, and could remember well the awe that the street‚Äôs opulence and glamour inspired when he rode his bike past with friends. A lot can change in thirty years, though. What remained was a mere shadow of what this place had once been. The many competing taverns and night clubs closed, the rowhomes that once contained up-and-coming senators and actors were derelict, and Lutzwater Heights, the nexus of it all, was almost empty. Only the son of the original owners, Christian, still resided inside, at least according to Theo‚Äôs contact.

Charlie didn‚Äôt let his eyes linger on any one part of Lutzwater boulevard for too long. The destruction was just too depressing, and in a certain sense, symbolic - the beauty of life and the promise of abundance in childhood turning to ash and shit as he aged.

One tiny piece of the deteriorating scenery, however, did strike Charlie in a way that gave him pause - it was something he had never noticed before. At its peak, Lutzwater Heights showcased an immaculately groomed front garden. Ochre and lavender flowers lined the entrance, greeting longtime residents, guests, and prospective residents of the prestigious building with an equal enthusiasm. Similar to the surrounding area, the garden had devolved into an abandoned wasteland, consisting only of overgrown shrubs and discarded liquor bottles. Close to his location at the stoop of the building, on the edge of the dead garden, however, sat a well that he did not recognize. He rode past the apartment complex thousands of times during his youth, and somehow never noticed the stone hatch with the accompanying wooden frame and bucket before now. The object‚Äôs presence was jarring against the backdrop of the dilapidated, contemporary architecture - and it would have been¬†*even more*¬†out of place when the location was at its prime. Now, it was able to partially conceal its uncanniness among the ruins. But thirty years ago, a pillory or a telephone booth sprouting out of the garden would have been less conspicuous than the well.

That said, it couldn‚Äôt have been new. To Charlie, that was infinitely more incomprehensible.

Another whiff of the horrible aroma broke his trance and reoriented Charlie to his current purpose on Lutzwater boulevard; Christian Lutzwater and his theoretical wealth. With information passed along from another career criminal, Theo believed there was a fortune hidden somewhere in the bubbling carcass of what¬†*used*¬†to be Lutzwater Heights, despite his parent‚Äôs real estate ventures going up in financial flames after their abrupt and cryptic disappearance over two decades ago.

*No idea how he could live with this fucking smell*,¬†Charlie thought, zipping his bag and placing the Vaporub in his coat pocket, assuming correctly that he would need to reapply the wax a few more times during their scheduled security system consultation/covert casing of the building and their target. Before following Theo into Lutzwater Heights, he rummaged through his wallet for coins to throw down the well, seeking to obtain good fortune from the pagan deities who might be able to affect the outcome of their so-called business venture. Without looking away from the inside of his wallet, he stood up and began to pace towards the well.

Unexpectedly, a sharp pain crackled from his big toe and radiated through his foot. Not paying attention, Charlie had slammed his boot into the well‚Äôs hard stone mid-stride. Apparently, he had misjudged his distance between the stoop, himself, and the well. Charlie felt sure that it had been a meter away, at least it had been before he started searching for coins, but the new throbbing discomfort sincerely disagreed with his previous assessment.

Apparently, the well was practically next to him.

Absentmindedly, he tossed the coins into the abyss without gazing into its inky depths. But as he did, pain and confusion had sidetracked his intended wish. Seeing Theo turn a corner and disappear from view, his mind was instead dragged back to its more fundamental concern as he provided the well with its tithe.

With his subconscious behind the wheel, Charlie wished to never be alone again.

As soon as the coins were swallowed by the blackness, the well instantly began to exude the ungodly odor, like fumes exploding from an exhaust pipe. Charlie didn‚Äôt understand what had changed, but he the let vapors propel him into action, finally sprinting to catch up with Theo. As he entered Lutzwater Heights, Charlie thought he heard the metal clink against the well‚Äôs bottom, but there was something off about that, too. The sound he heard wasn‚Äôt exactly that of a handful of coins briefly clattering against stone. Instead, a sort of quiet but frantic skittering emanated from somewhere in the darkness, like thousands of human nails tapping nervously against chalk - almost in perfect synchrony, but not quite.

\----------------------------------------------

***Two:***

Christian Lutzwater looked profoundly unwell. Huge, dark half-moons shadowed the flesh below his eyes, pulling his face down so much that he appeared unshakably joyless, the resulting creases injecting a deep gloom into every facial expression he could manifest. By Theo‚Äôs estimation, the man was only forty years old, but his emaciated cheeks and greying comb-over could have given anyone the impression that he was, at best, pushing sixty. Despite those features, his well-pressed, blue pin-stripe suit and solid black tie indicated he was still interested in appearances. At the kitchen table in the building‚Äôs largest suite, situated at the very back of the third floor, the thieves watched as Christian humbly brewed them a pot of coffee. As he did, Charlie clandestinely scanned the area, determining where they could install a remote camera or two when he wasn‚Äôt paying attention.

*‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶where do you need the cameras? In the entrance, the alleyways‚Ä¶?*¬†Theo paused, hoping Christian would pick up where he left off.

Despite not being an employee at Charlie‚Äôs security agency, Theo seemed to enjoy steering the consultations, occasionally giving the impression to their soon-to-be victims that he ran the company or that security was a family business he grew up in. In actuality, Theo didn‚Äôt know the first thing about installing security systems. Yet, his self-assured manner brought the trust of their targets more often than it didn‚Äôt.

As long as Theo successfully pulled off the his part in the robberies while wearing the uniform Charlie stole for him, he happily relinquished control. Time and time again, the blueprint worked. From Charlie‚Äôs perspective, why mess with a good thing just to feed his ego?

The operation was both clever and profitable. The thieves would steal from their marks a few days¬†*prior*¬†to installing the purchased security systems, which helped them avoid suspicion. It was a simple and easy to execute plan: they would attend consultations with their marks, confirm that they had valuable belongings and no preexisting security measures, and then they would strike. The marks suspected their wealth needed better monitoring - that‚Äôs why they had reached out to Charlie‚Äôs company in the first place, so it was no surprise when a burglary actually came to pass. After many of their targets were robbed, their only lingering regret was that they had not called Theo and Charlie sooner, as they imagined a security system may have been able to prevent the financial losses.

*‚ÄúThere are several sewer grates around the periphery of the property, a majority of them near the parking lot, ""*¬†Christian remarked matter-of-factly.

*‚ÄúI need them all covered by a remote video feed that I can have access to.‚Äù*

Theo, for all his virtues, did not have a talent for improvisation, and Christian‚Äôs answer had caught him off-guard. Stunned and at a loss, Theo turned to Charlie for help.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not sure that will cover the front gate or the entrance, Mr. Lutzwater.‚Äù*¬†Charlie mumbled, who was also recovering from the overwhelming strangeness of his original response.

*Who the hell would try to enter the complex through the fucking sewers?*

From across the kitchen table, Christian set his pallid gaze on Charlie, visibly upset by the insinuation that he didn‚Äôt know what he wanted. He was not accustomed to being questioned by anyone, let alone by some a blue-collar nobody. Slowly, however, his expression melted from righteous indignation back to its baseline, sorrowful state. Only after a short time did Mr. Lutzwater grasp that his request could be seen as unreasonable to anyone unaware of what writhed within his apartment complex.

Without breaking eye contact with Charlie, he slowly conjured a synthetic grin to his face, the corners of his mouth seemingly held up and in position by imperceptible marionette strings.

*‚ÄúOf course, the entrance will need to be monitored as well. I mentioned the sewer grates first because we‚Äôve had local children spraying graffiti on those areas - seems like I can‚Äôt get it off my mind,‚Äù*¬†he replied, following the statement with a mechanical chuckle and a sip of his coffee.

Feeling like the flow of conversation was back on track, Theo eagerly returned to the fold.

*‚ÄúYou sure you don‚Äôt want a camera for your apartment, too? Can never be too safe with gangs of delinquents roaming the streets,‚Äù*¬†Theo proclaimed with a toothy smile.

*‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt live here, young man. I visit the property daily to make sure everything is still somewhat maintained, but I‚Ä¶but I certainly don‚Äôt sleep here.‚Äù*

A subtle tremor of fear creeped into Christian‚Äôs voice when he implied he would¬†*never*¬†spend the night at Lutzwater Heights. Not only did the prospect of sleeping here scare him, but it appeared like he believed he said something that he should not have. He abruptly shifted the conversation to finalizing his order. After signing the agreement, he excused himself to the restroom, allowing Charlie the opportunity to plant a small camera into the kitchen‚Äôs smoker detector.

*‚ÄúOkay gentleman,‚Äù*¬†Christian proclaimed as he returned from the bathroom, sitting down across from Charlie as he did,¬†*‚ÄúI believe we have negotiated the first part of the deal‚Ä¶‚Äù*

‚Äú*What other parts are there, sir?‚Äù*¬†Charlie interjected. Mr. Lutzwater had already signed and paid for the security system. The older thief turned to his left, looking to see his younger compatriot understood what Christian meant. But he was not at the table. Charlie darted his head wildly around its axis, trying to locate Theo had gotten off to. Just moments before, he‚Äôd been beside Charlie, yet there had been no sounds of a chair scraping or Theo‚Äôs footsteps to suggest he‚Äôd left the table while he was briefly distracted by Mr. Lutzwater‚Äôs return.

When Charlie‚Äôs gaze found its way back to Christian, terror bloomed thick and ravenous deep within his chest. His pulse quickened, blood vibrating ferociously through his entire body. He blinked over and over again, but the image in front of him did not change.

Without warning, Mr. Lutzwater‚Äôs face has evolved into something else entirely.

*‚ÄúYou know what I mean, Charlie. How many times have we had this conversation? I need your answer. I need your answer now.‚Äù*

The phrase seeped listlessly out of one Christian‚Äôs new cavities. All of his facial features had been replaced by three oval slits, overflowing with impenetrable, inky darkness. Two vertical slits run parallel to each other over the top two-thirds of his skull, with one horizontal slit laying flatly under the both of them on the bottom third. The steel-blue skin in between the holes was smooth and blemishless, but it appeared dangerously taut, like a plastic bag that had been filled to brim and was primed to split and rupture at any moment - or, maybe, that tightness had already caused the skin to break, resulting in the three slits that were currently staring at him.

Charlie‚Äôs aching psyche interpreted the slits as a face, but they looked just as much like the holes in a power outlet as they did two long eyes and one even longer mouth. Yes, language had come from it, but the words had not emanated from his so-called ""mouth"". Instead, the statement leaked out of what Charlie assumed was Christian‚Äôs new left eye, causing the crevasse to widen slightly and tremble as it did.

*‚ÄúYou made your request - a cure for loneliness. That is something we can provide, but at a cost. We will want the first of your bloodline, as payment for our generosity.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I‚Ä¶‚Äù*¬†Charlie blubbered.

In response to his indecision, all three slits began to ripple soundlessly, like a frustrated scream imperceptible to Charlie was being unleashed from all three orifices simultaneously.

Every night since the consultation, he had experienced the same nightmare. It always started as a memory, a replaying of events, but inevitably culminated with Christian‚Äôs transformation. But this was first one where he had actually answered the question. All the times before, the vision ended before he had made a decision.

For the remaining three days prior to the heist, Charlie‚Äôs sleep would be barren and nightmareless, but it would not be restful.

\------------

Each day, Theo checked the hidden camera‚Äôs recorded feed. In doing so, he determined that there may be something valuable secretly stored within the third-floor suite. In addition, he had confirmed that no one else currently lived inside Lutzwater Heights. No room had been rented out for at least half a decade.

Christian was not lying when he claimed that he visited the premises daily. Every day, about an hour before sundown like clockwork, Mr. Lutzwater would enter the apartment. Without wasting a second, he would pace over urgently to a painting on the wall. He would pull it aside, revealing that it was connected to the wall on a hinge. Because of the camera‚Äôs position, it was impossible to discern what lay beyond the painting; the camera‚Äôs angle hid that view. However, Christian very clearly took a key that hung around his neck, inserted it into something on the wall, and then reached in to the wall. To Theo, that meant there must be cash, jewelry, or something similarly worth our trouble concealed in that space.

Charlie squinted at the footage proudly displayed by Theo from his old and well-worn laptop. Something caught his eye that the younger thief had neglected to mention.

His lips were moving.

*‚ÄúWho do you think he‚Äôs talking to?‚Äù*¬†Charlie asked, praying that Theo had a good explanation.

*‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶he‚Äôs probably on a call. Bluetooth or something,‚Äù*¬†Theo replied while scratching the side of his head, clearly unbothered by the finding.

*‚ÄúHm. Yeah, I guess that makes sense.‚Äù*¬†Charlie halfheartedly remarked, lying mostly to himself in that moment. There was no evidence to back-up Theo‚Äôs deduction. Christian didn‚Äôt appear to have ear buds in, nor did he ever take out a phone to indicate he was taking a call, and whenever he was in that apartment, his lips were¬†*always*¬†moving.

But the camera never caught anyone else in that apartment, Charlie told himself.

Theo must be right.

With twilight rapidly enveloping the landscape, Christian hastily twisted the key into the front door‚Äôs lock. As he shook the knob to confirm it was sealed, the snout of a handgun kissed his right temple.

*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move, don‚Äôt scream.‚Äù* Theo growled from under his ski mask in a voice so gravelly and cartoonish that Charlie was forced to suppress a laugh stirring in his throat.

Although Mr. Lutzwater obeyed Theo‚Äôs commands, his austere aura instantly evaporated, crumbling into primal fear. He lowered his voice to a whisper, and attempted to negotiate with his captor, stuttering through bouts of hyperventilation.

*‚ÄúYes, yes‚Ä¶let me‚Ä¶let me show you to my veh-vehicle. I have‚Ä¶I have money‚Ä¶I have money there. And of course wi-with me.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúBut we need to go - we need to go now.‚Äù*

Snickering devilishly, Theo denied his request,

*‚ÄúNo, Christian. We want the money inside your suite first. If you don‚Äôt move to open the door in the next few seconds, I‚Äôm going to drive hot lead through your kneecaps, and then we‚Äôll drag you to your suite. Either way, we‚Äôre going in.‚Äù*

As Christian overcame his now full-body tremors enough to unlock the front door, Charlie began preemptively smearing Vaporub through wispy mustache hairs, expecting the embrace of that horrific odor the moment he stepped inside.

If he wasn‚Äôt so focused on the task at hand, he may have noticed the pungent aroma was conspicuously absent as the three men descended into the apartment complex. Or that, somehow, the well that was present in the garden just a week prior had evaporated into nothingness, leaving the surrounding soil present and undisturbed, like it had never been there in the first place.

\------------

Spitting out a teaspoon of blood and fragments of teeth onto the kitchen tile of the third-floor suite, Christian finally relented and spoke, unable able to withstand another merciless beating:

*‚ÄúThe silver key with the red tip is a skeleton key. It opens all the apartments in the building. The pure gold one is for behind the painting.‚Äù* his tone boggy from the warm puddles of liquid accumulating in his mouth and throat.

*‚ÄúBut please - there is nothing here‚Ä¶nothing here that you want. We need‚Ä¶we need to go‚Ä¶‚Äù*

Charlie tossed the keys to Theo, who proceeded to investigate the cubby behind the painting while he kept on an eye on Christian, who was currently handcuffed to a wooden chair at the kitchen table. The first time the thieves had interrogated a mark, they were soft and willing to compromise. Years of experience and desensitization, however, had made them rigid and merciless. It was for everyone‚Äôs benefit, Charlie rationalized. The faster they cave, the faster the experience can be over for all of them - pulling punches only prolonged the trauma.

*‚ÄúTabitha‚Ä¶Tabitha‚Ä¶oh lord forgive me‚Ä¶‚Äù* Christian muttered to himself, chin to chest, with plasma dripping from the corner of his mouth and on to the collar of his dress shirt.

The older thief had become concerned they had bludgeoned Mr. Lutzwater a little *too* hard. The man had been spilling eerie nonsense from his lips since Theo‚Äôs knuckles met his skull. It was supremely disconcerting, witnessing the battered mark plead to some unseen woman. Reapplying the wax under his nostrils, Charlie wished they had brought some duct tape to cover Christian‚Äôs mouth. Something to silence his ominous caterwauling so they could work in peace.

*‚ÄúCharlie, come take a look at this,‚Äù* Theo shouted from the living room.

Frustrated, he left Christian to his ramblings and walked towards the sound of Theo‚Äôs voice, chastising his helplessness: *‚ÄúIf the key he said isn‚Äôt working on the safe, just start tryin‚Äô some of the other‚Ä¶‚Äù*

The ongoing criticism suffocated in Charlie‚Äôs windpipe when he saw what was behind the painting.

It was a circular hole, seething with darkness and about the size of a manhole cover. A barred, steel gate separated the cavity inside the wall from the apartment, which was tilted outwards toward Theo, who had unlocked it and left it ajar with the key Christian had indicated.

The veteran criminal stumbled back from the awful odor emanating from the opening; it was far stronger than anything he‚Äôd previously encountered at Lutzwater Heights. The scent was an alchemical mixture of algae, rusted metal and sulfur, and it lingered almost palpably in the air like vaporized molasses. Even Theo, with his diminished sense of smell, felt himself involuntarily stepping backwards from the deathly aroma.

From the other room, Christian‚Äôs pleading amplified in synchrony with the odor. He howled for Tabitha to forgive him, and to forgive us. He cried out, proclaiming that we were all about to leave and that she should stay where she was.

Charlie found himself paralyzed, comatosely swaying in place while his brain fought to catch up with and understand their current circumstances. Theo, born without Charlie‚Äôs common sense, indifferently walked forward and placed his entire head and right arm in the hole, illuminating the space with his flashlight.

Theo eventually spoke, his words muffled but audible: *‚ÄúOther than smelling like garbage fire, there‚Äôs nothing in here, Charlie. Goddamn, the space goes on for a while. I can‚Äôt really even tell where it ends.‚Äù*

Pulling his upper body from the crevice, Theo paced angrily past Charlie and back into the kitchen, smashing the flashlight against Christian‚Äôs jaw with such force that the plexiglass shattered.

*‚ÄúWhere the fuck is the money, dickhead?‚Äù* he shouted, livid from confusion.

Between the panic and injury, however, Christian had been reduced to a warbling mess. As he arced his broken flashlight above his head for another swing, Charlie broke through his stasis in time to grab Theo‚Äôs arm by the wrist.

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to kill him, Theo. He said the silver key can open all the empty apartments, yeah? Let‚Äôs go check a few out. If there‚Äôs nothing in them, this may be a wash,‚Äù*

Charlie‚Äôs hushed tone soothed him, and Theo cooled. Within seconds, he began to feel a rising, intense embarrassment that Charlie had witnessed such a volcanic outburst.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶fine. Stay put, asshole.‚Äù* Theo mumbled, dropping the broken flashlight at Christian‚Äôs feet with a calamitous thud that made his entire body twitch from being startled, and they stepped out, leaving an alarmingly silent Christian behind.

\------------

Because Theo‚Äôs violent tantrum had broken their only real flashlight, the thieves were reduced to using their phone flashlights for guidance. Lutzwater Heights‚Äô was, to Charlie‚Äôs surprise, almost completely without electricity, excluding the suite that Christian visited daily.

Shepherded by the faint glow of Theo‚Äôs device, the men tiptoed down the hallway towards the next closest apartment. They didn‚Äôt know exactly *why* they were attempting to move silently - Theo had confirmed ahead of time that the building had no additional security or tenets. Yet, it still felt unacceptably incredibly dangerous to stomp around Lutzwater Heights in the dead of night.

In a moment of voluminous silence, Charlie could swear he heard something skittering behind them. The noise was familiar - it was the same frenetic tapping he heard when he tossed his change down the well a week earlier. When he used Theo‚Äôs wrist as a handle to turn the direction of the light, however, they saw nothing but an empty hallway.

*‚ÄúWhat are you doing, psycho?‚Äù* Theo snapped, wrenching his hand away from Charlie‚Äôs grip.

*‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt‚Ä¶hear that? The tapping?‚Äù* Charlie whispered, swiveling his head from side-to-side, trying to identify the best possible angle to isolate the true location of the noise, which still seemed to be spinning and twisting around him.

Masking his own growing terror with a familiar bravado, he rebuked Charlie and continued to move forward.

*‚ÄúJesus man, get a grip,‚Äù*

Room 302 was just a short distance away. As Theo pivoted the knob, Charlie felt an uncontrollable twinge of fear sprint up and down his spine, but his only friend had already proceeded into the blackness before he could stop him. Reluctantly, he forced himself through the threshold too.

In his haste, Charlie almost trampled Theo, who was barely inside the room, fiddling with the light switch on the door‚Äôs right. Despite a bevy of attempts, no electricity appeared to brighten the room and expunge the darkness.

*‚ÄúUgh, figures. Guess he wasn‚Äôt lying about the power.‚Äù* Theo declared impatiently, desperate for this whole experience to be over, but unwilling to admit defeat and leave without some financial reparations for their time. He stepped forward, briefly illuminating something so bizarre and unexpected that it caused the phone to drop from Theo‚Äôs grip. It clattered to the floor, flashlight side-up, and slid a little further into the tomb. When the phone ran out of momentum, it was positioned directly under the impossible oddity, dramatically flooding light on to it from below like it was on display in a museum.

Multiple large, fleshy tubes ran the length of the otherwise empty living quarters. They were all approximately three feet in diameter, covered in sickly white skin adorned with thousands of ridges that gave them the appearance of an unnaturally gigantic colon or earthworm. Each cylinder entered and exited the room through holes located at different points and heights, causing them to tangle and overlap, like a ball of oversized fingers. The thieves were positioned only an arm‚Äôs length away from the writhing mass, which gurgled and churned with movement every few seconds.

As the tubes writhed, mists of the infernal aroma washed over the thieves, causing Charlie to fall back against the door and vomit, unintentionally closing the door and sealing the room in the process.

Although spellbound by the hallucinogenic sight, Theo still bent over and reached his hand out to retrieve his phone, with the nearest tube only inches above the ground where the device lay. Nearly on his knees, he contorted himself carefully to avoid letting his upper body make contact with another tube that hung higher in the room. Through heavy breathing, the palm of his hand made contact with the phone, covering the flashlight and plunging the room into a lightless, ebony void.

All of a sudden, a distant crash caused a hypervigilant Theo to involuntarily turn his head to left, his body attempting to assess another potential threat by looking in the direction of the sound.

A wet slap resonated through the room. Theo‚Äôs cheek and forehead had contacted one of the writhing tubes, and the sensation caused him to reflexively drop his phone. A ray of light reappeared and floodlit Theo, forcing Charlie to bear witness to the hellish scene that followed.

The pallid skin of the tube trilled as Theo‚Äôs face connected with its tissue, resulting in a ripple of tiny, pointed waves radiating in a circle from the point of contact, like a pebble disturbing the surface of a still lake. As he tried to move his forehead away, a slab of vibrating flesh the size of an oven mitt erupted outward from a part of the tube directly above his head. The flesh stood motionless in the air for a second, looking like a wriggling amorphous tombstone. It was almost like the tube wasn‚Äôt actually solid - more a congealed liquid that had settled on structuring itself in a rope shape, for one reason or another, as the appearance of the fleshy apparatus did rip or tear at the tube, and the space that it once took up was quickly refilled with more silvery skin.

In one swift motion, thousands of tiny, twisting barbs sprouted from the side of the fleshy tombstone that faced Theo, only to come crashing down on his unprotected forehead and scalp.

Theo released an unearthly cacophony from his lungs in response. An impossibly concentrated terror made dissonant music through his vocal cords, resulting in a scream so disconcertingly primal that it caused Charlie to kick his heels back against the floor, pushing himself into the fetal position in the corner of the room. Steaming blood dripped down Theo‚Äôs face like melting candle wax, staining his visible skin a deep crimson.

From above Theo, another tube audibly shifted. The congealed skin appeared to be moving its most superficial layer clockwise, like the tube was a sausage and the casing of it was somehow rapidly spinning around an unseen axis. After a few seconds, a familiar three slits slid into Charlie‚Äôs peripheral vision. The shifting slowed and stopped once the holes were situated directly above Theo‚Äôs head, pointed at him and observing his plight dispassionately like someone who found a creature squealing under the harsh steel of a mouse trap, trying to determine exactly what they had caught.

A moment later, Christian‚Äôs foot collided violently with 302‚Äôs door, striding into the commotion with a confidence that showcased that he was relatively unphased by the horror before him. He was still handcuffed to part of the wooden chair that he had shattered by toppling himself over while unguarded in the other room. Christian beckoned to Charlie with the barrel of a shotgun, wordlessly imploring him to leave the room under his protection. The older thief rapidly crawled on all fours in Christian‚Äôs direction, sprawling on his back and wailing once he had reached the safety of the hallway.

Then, from inside 302, a blast rung out. The explosion finally quieted Theo‚Äôs agony, leaving only the sound of Charlie‚Äôs sobs echoing through the apartment complex.

Dress shoes clicked towards Charlie, slow and deliberate. In a twist of positions, the snout of Christian‚Äôs still fuming shotgun was pressed lightly against Charlie‚Äôs forehead.

*‚ÄúGet up. Show me where you saw the well.‚Äù*

\----------------------------------------------

***Four:***

*There once was a lonely young boy named Christian.*

*Although his family was tremendously wealthy, an expansive mansion and a fleet of servants did not quell his loneliness.*

*However, fate intervened when a young girl named Tabitha showed up in Christian‚Äôs expansive backyard one day. They were fast friends, enjoying the same games and stories as each other.*

*Christian and Tabitha even kind of looked alike, like siblings or twins. But the resemblance was not a coincidence - this was intentional.*

*Rosemary and Sebastian, Christian‚Äôs parents, had purchased Tabitha from a local drunk, happy to turn one of her children into money to buy more liquor.*

*In a time before Christian‚Äôs birth, Sebastian had struck a deal with something that lived inside a well. While in a space between dreams and wakefulness, he had consented to a pact offering immense riches in exchange for the first of his bloodline.*

*Thus, Sebastian was an overnight success in the world of real estate. And for a while, things were good and peaceful. If that thing in the well ever came back and asked for their end of the deal, he had a plan.*

*Sebastian was reminded of the deal‚Äôs terms two years after buying Tabitha when he saw a familiar-looking well appear in the backyard, right around Christian‚Äôs eighth birthday.*

*Secretly, as night fell, Sebastian and Rosemary awakened Tabitha. As quickly as they could, they shaved her head to match Christian‚Äôs. They dressed her in Christian‚Äôs clothes. Then, they had their most trusted servant throw her down the well.*

*When Rosemary and Sebastian could no longer see the well or hear Tabitha‚Äôs cries, they assumed their debt had been paid - their surrogate first-born accepted.*

*But Christian could still see the well. Christian could still hear Tabitha‚Äôs cries day and night. Slowly, the pitch of her voice became lower and lower. The cries of pain transitioned into screams of anger. And one night, Christian was pulled to his bedroom window by a skittering, tapping sound coming from the well.*

*Horrified, he watched a massive worm emerge from the well, ascending the stone wall on thousands of legs that seemed to vanish and reappear as it climbed. It was almost unable to drag itself out of the hole, its diameter being a near-perfect mold of the inside of the well, causing it to fit very snugly in place.*

*The end that first appeared from the well was flat and blunted, adorned with three slits that Christian interpreted as a face. In the beginning, it was no longer a broomstick. But as it dragged more and more of the servants into the well at night, its size grew.*

*Christian could have warned his parents, but Tabitha got to him first. She skittered up to his second-story bedroom, and he let her inside. The details of the betrayal and the pain Tabitha had gone through convinced Christian to keep her transformation a secret.*

*He was twelve when Tabitha finally pulled Sebastian and Rosemary into the well, crying out for Christian to help them. But at that point, Tabitha was almost a half mile long, living tangled up in the walls of the mansion. He couldn‚Äôt have helped them, even if he wanted to.*

*When Tabitha finally got too big for the house, she retreated into the sewers at Christian‚Äôs behest.*

*He promised that he had found a new home for her.*

\------------

At gunpoint, Christian forced Charlie to the front of Lutzwater Heights, where the well was initially spotted. During the short journey, Mr. Lutzwater bombarded his captive with an array of unintelligible ramblings. Christian never had anyone to talk to about Tabitha. So, when he had Charlie as his unwilling confident, someone who had seen Tabitha and lived, he simply couldn‚Äôt help himself. The floodgates broke, and years of pent-up madness spilled through.

*‚ÄúShe wants to leave and live in the sewers, but I won‚Äôt let her,‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI had to evacuate the building - she is getting too big to live for the walls, needed to start living in the apartments, too,‚Äù*

*‚ÄúThe well still wants me, that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs so hungry all the time. But I feed her, and she would never hurt me, no matter how hungry she got,‚Äù*

*‚ÄúTabitha gets hungrier at night - I told you we shouldn‚Äôt have gone in,‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about this, but no one can find out,‚Äù*

Outside Lutzwater Heights, by the well, Charlie desperately begged Christian to let him return home. But Mr. Lutzwater couldn‚Äôt hear anything he had to say over the deafening sounds of his jagged, non-linear monologue.

Tabitha rose from the well. Before Charlie could make a break for it, she caught his leg and twisted around him like a boa constrictor. The pale flesh squished against his body. He braced himself to be devoured like Theo, but he remained intact as Tabitha coiled around him. The barbs, her teeth, had not yet rematerialized.

From his immobilized position, Charlie saw another piece of Tabitha silently slither out the front door. Christian‚Äôs endless monologue continued, even though Charlie could not hear a single word of it over the droning and churning of Tabitha‚Äôs liquid flesh.

Mr. Lutzwater never saw it coming.

Tabitha‚Äôs barbs dug into his right ankle and calf, causing an immediate and ear-splitting scream from Christian that only Charlie was close enough to hear. The congealed flesh then flipped him upside down, causing his head to slam into the hard earth, and knocking him unconscious.

The thick tendril then hoisted him into the air, moving Christian directly over the well‚Äôs maw. As it did, the tentacle that was holding Charlie in place uncoiled and receded into the well, disappearing from view.

A voice then echoed from inside the inky blackness, deep and unfamiliar.

*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget about our deal, Charlie. This is what happens when you don‚Äôt abide by the terms.‚Äù*

And with that, the tentacle holding Christian released its grasp, causing him to fall noiselessly into the well. Shortly afterwards, that tentacle followed Christian in. For the next few hours, Charlie sat upright on the ground and wordlessly watched miles of Tabitha slither from the entrance and into the well. As the sun finally started to rise, the last of her squeezed itself into the hole. Once it did, Charlie could see the well no longer.

\------------

Two months later, Charlie had his first date with Hilda. She owned a coffee shop next door to where he had been getting therapy. Charlie never divulged to anyone what he saw happen that night - only admitting that he had a close friend pass away in front of him, never willing to divest additional details.

Hilda was immediately enamored with Charlie, despite his overwhelmingly colorless demeanor in the wake of Theo‚Äôs death. He was skeptical at first, but then Charlie recalled the terms of his deal.

Sometimes, he thinks he sees the well. In public and in private, lurking on the very edge of his peripheral vision. He frequently steels himself and compartmentalizes his emotions, not wanting to become too attached to the idea of Charlie Junior, despite Hilda being pregnant.

A small price to pay to never be alone again.

An awful, ungodly stench struck Charlie the moment he opened the creaking front door of the nearly abandoned apartment complex. He winced, reflexively jerking his face away from the entryway so that his lungs might find new air. The thief‚Äôs chest audibly rattled as he voraciously sucked in the atmosphere outside the doorway, hand still gripping the brass doorknob. Curious, Theo leaned into the building, inhaling a sample of the escaping vapors. With a chastising shake of his head, he exhaled, chuckling as he did. The younger of the two thieves ducked under Charlie‚Äôs arm and pushed forward, seizing the opportunity emasculate his colleague‚Äôs fragile sensibilities - teasing him for being so dumbstruck by an aroma. However, Theo‚Äôs chronic sinusitis had diminished his sense of smell, unbeknownst to his older colleague. So, despite Theo being able to detect the potent aroma, it was unable to restrain him like it did Charlie.

Theo admired Charlie as a mentor and felt a hint of jealousy towards him, so he found satisfaction in having something to hold over his head. His untimely demise in one of these flats would prevent Theo from ever disclosing this admiration.

‚Äú*C‚Äômon now, old man. No time to stop and smell the roses,*‚Äù Theo mocked, now leisurely strolling down the narrow, dimly lit lobby.

He wanted to move himself along, imaging himself running ahead to overtake Theo. But Charlie could not force his body through the partition and further into the corrosive scent, the intensity of which continued to increase as more stale air poured from the dilapidated building. Charlie struggled to identify what exactly could produce such a foul odor. It was acrid and gamey, reminiscent of meat spoiled in the summer sun; but at the same time, it also had a metallic and artificial quality, similar to the inside of a bustling factory. Stagnant, putrefied water closely resembled the stench, he considered, but it didn‚Äôt quite match.

Instead of following Theo in, Charlie raised a defiant middle finger as he bent over to retrieve the Vicks Vaporub from his backpack. From somewhere further down the hallway, he heard his partner flippantly squawk about Charlie‚Äôs feminine constitution. As he listened to the continued goading, Charlie could not fathom how Theo had developed such a bravado. The man was nearly as broke as he him, he had no girlfriend, and he carted around a body shaped like a neglected pear, one that had sat in the fruit bowl for a few too many days - rotting and sagging in all the wrong places. With Theo somehow¬†*still*¬†chattering on, Charlie sighed and smeared the waxy material over the crest of his upper lip as a barrier against the assaulting odor.

He wasn‚Äôt much better in comparison, though, Charlie lamented to himself. Gaunt and skeletal, he stood at a monstrous six foot seven inches. Though potentially commanding, his great height was offset by a total absence of muscle. Last time he checked, his weight clocked in at just shy of one hundred and twenty pounds. If Theo resembled a decaying pear, Charlie embodied an anemic popsicle stick. Perhaps, he mused, he and Theo were actually a perfect match - both objects that had well outlived their usefulness and only truly belonged at the heart of a landfill.

He at least possessed some companionship, he reflected, however meager it may be. Charlie could not stand the notion of being truly, utterly alone. He had grown to avoid it at all costs.

Protected from the disabling scent, Charlie took a beat to more thoroughly survey the street. Not that there was that much to see. The area was completely deserted and dilapidated, devoid of any sign of human habitation. That wasn‚Äôt always the case, though. Lutzwater boulevard used to represent the cornerstone of the city‚Äôs downtown, with this apartment complex acting as the linchpin that held it all together. Charlie relocated from the suburbs to the city at age ten, and could remember well the awe that the street‚Äôs opulence and glamour inspired when he rode his bike past with friends. A lot can change in thirty years, though. What remained was a mere shadow of what this place had once been. The many competing taverns and night clubs closed, the rowhomes that once contained up-and-coming senators and actors were derelict, and Lutzwater Heights, the nexus of it all, was almost empty. Only the son of the original owners, Christian, still resided inside, at least according to Theo‚Äôs contact.

Charlie didn‚Äôt let his eyes linger on any one part of Lutzwater boulevard for too long. The destruction was just too depressing, and in a certain sense, symbolic - the beauty of life and the promise of abundance in childhood turning to ash and shit as he aged.

One tiny piece of the deteriorating scenery, however, did strike Charlie in a way that gave him pause - it was something he had never noticed before. At its peak, Lutzwater Heights showcased an immaculately groomed front garden. Ochre and lavender flowers lined the entrance, greeting longtime residents, guests, and prospective residents of the prestigious building with an equal enthusiasm. Similar to the surrounding area, the garden had devolved into an abandoned wasteland, consisting only of overgrown shrubs and discarded liquor bottles. Close to his location at the stoop of the building, on the edge of the dead garden, however, sat a well that he did not recognize. He rode past the apartment complex thousands of times during his youth, and somehow never noticed the stone hatch with the accompanying wooden frame and bucket before now. The object‚Äôs presence was jarring against the backdrop of the dilapidated, contemporary architecture - and it would have been¬†*even more*¬†out of place when the location was at its prime. Now, it was able to partially conceal its uncanniness among the ruins. But thirty years ago, a pillory or a telephone booth sprouting out of the garden would have been less conspicuous than the well.

That said, it couldn‚Äôt have been new. To Charlie, that was infinitely more incomprehensible.

Another whiff of the horrible aroma broke his trance and reoriented Charlie to his current purpose on Lutzwater boulevard; Christian Lutzwater and his theoretical wealth. With information passed along from another career criminal, Theo believed there was a fortune hidden somewhere in the bubbling carcass of what¬†*used*¬†to be Lutzwater Heights, despite his parent‚Äôs real estate ventures going up in financial flames after their abrupt and cryptic disappearance over two decades ago.

*No idea how he could live with this fucking smell*,¬†Charlie thought, zipping his bag and placing the Vaporub in his coat pocket, assuming correctly that he would need to reapply the wax a few more times during their scheduled security system consultation/covert casing of the building and their target. Before following Theo into Lutzwater Heights, he rummaged through his wallet for coins to throw down the well, seeking to obtain good fortune from the pagan deities who might be able to affect the outcome of their so-called business venture. Without looking away from the inside of his wallet, he stood up and began to pace towards the well.

Unexpectedly, a sharp pain crackled from his big toe and radiated through his foot. Not paying attention, Charlie had slammed his boot into the well‚Äôs hard stone mid-stride. Apparently, he had misjudged his distance between the stoop, himself, and the well. Charlie felt sure that it had been a meter away, at least it had been before he started searching for coins, but the new throbbing discomfort sincerely disagreed with his previous assessment.

Apparently, the well was practically next to him.

Absentmindedly, he tossed the coins into the abyss without gazing into its inky depths. But as he did, pain and confusion had sidetracked his intended wish. Seeing Theo turn a corner and disappear from view, his mind was instead dragged back to its more fundamental concern as he provided the well with its tithe.

With his subconscious behind the wheel, Charlie wished to never be alone again.

As soon as the coins were swallowed by the blackness, the well instantly began to exude the ungodly odor, like fumes exploding from an exhaust pipe. Charlie didn‚Äôt understand what had changed, but he the let vapors propel him into action, finally sprinting to catch up with Theo. As he entered Lutzwater Heights, Charlie thought he heard the metal clink against the well‚Äôs bottom, but there was something off about that, too. The sound he heard wasn‚Äôt exactly that of a handful of coins briefly clattering against stone. Instead, a sort of quiet but frantic skittering emanated from somewhere in the darkness, like thousands of human nails tapping nervously against chalk - almost in perfect synchrony, but not quite.

\----------------------------------------------

***Two:***

Christian Lutzwater looked profoundly unwell. Huge, dark half-moons shadowed the flesh below his eyes, pulling his face down so much that he appeared unshakably joyless, the resulting creases injecting a deep gloom into every facial expression he could manifest. By Theo‚Äôs estimation, the man was only forty years old, but his emaciated cheeks and greying comb-over could have given anyone the impression that he was, at best, pushing sixty. Despite those features, his well-pressed, blue pin-stripe suit and solid black tie indicated he was still interested in appearances. At the kitchen table in the building‚Äôs largest suite, situated at the very back of the third floor, the thieves watched as Christian humbly brewed them a pot of coffee. As he did, Charlie clandestinely scanned the area, determining where they could install a remote camera or two when he wasn‚Äôt paying attention.

*‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶where do you need the cameras? In the entrance, the alleyways‚Ä¶?*¬†Theo paused, hoping Christian would pick up where he left off.

Despite not being an employee at Charlie‚Äôs security agency, Theo seemed to enjoy steering the consultations, occasionally giving the impression to their soon-to-be victims that he ran the company or that security was a family business he grew up in. In actuality, Theo didn‚Äôt know the first thing about installing security systems. Yet, his self-assured manner brought the trust of their targets more often than it didn‚Äôt.

As long as Theo successfully pulled off the his part in the robberies while wearing the uniform Charlie stole for him, he happily relinquished control. Time and time again, the blueprint worked. From Charlie‚Äôs perspective, why mess with a good thing just to feed his ego?

The operation was both clever and profitable. The thieves would steal from their marks a few days¬†*prior*¬†to installing the purchased security systems, which helped them avoid suspicion. It was a simple and easy to execute plan: they would attend consultations with their marks, confirm that they had valuable belongings and no preexisting security measures, and then they would strike. The marks suspected their wealth needed better monitoring - that‚Äôs why they had reached out to Charlie‚Äôs company in the first place, so it was no surprise when a burglary actually came to pass. After many of their targets were robbed, their only lingering regret was that they had not called Theo and Charlie sooner, as they imagined a security system may have been able to prevent the financial losses.

*‚ÄúThere are several sewer grates around the periphery of the property, a majority of them near the parking lot, ""*¬†Christian remarked matter-of-factly.

*‚ÄúI need them all covered by a remote video feed that I can have access to.‚Äù*

Theo, for all his virtues, did not have a talent for improvisation, and Christian‚Äôs answer had caught him off-guard. Stunned and at a loss, Theo turned to Charlie for help.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not sure that will cover the front gate or the entrance, Mr. Lutzwater.‚Äù*¬†Charlie mumbled, who was also recovering from the overwhelming strangeness of his original response.

*Who the hell would try to enter the complex through the fucking sewers?*

From across the kitchen table, Christian set his pallid gaze on Charlie, visibly upset by the insinuation that he didn‚Äôt know what he wanted. He was not accustomed to being questioned by anyone, let alone by some a blue-collar nobody. Slowly, however, his expression melted from righteous indignation back to its baseline, sorrowful state. Only after a short time did Mr. Lutzwater grasp that his request could be seen as unreasonable to anyone unaware of what writhed within his apartment complex.

Without breaking eye contact with Charlie, he slowly conjured a synthetic grin to his face, the corners of his mouth seemingly held up and in position by imperceptible marionette strings.

*‚ÄúOf course, the entrance will need to be monitored as well. I mentioned the sewer grates first because we‚Äôve had local children spraying graffiti on those areas - seems like I can‚Äôt get it off my mind,‚Äù*¬†he replied, following the statement with a mechanical chuckle and a sip of his coffee.

Feeling like the flow of conversation was back on track, Theo eagerly returned to the fold.

*‚ÄúYou sure you don‚Äôt want a camera for your apartment, too? Can never be too safe with gangs of delinquents roaming the streets,‚Äù*¬†Theo proclaimed with a toothy smile.

*‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt live here, young man. I visit the property daily to make sure everything is still somewhat maintained, but I‚Ä¶but I certainly don‚Äôt sleep here.‚Äù*

A subtle tremor of fear creeped into Christian‚Äôs voice when he implied he would¬†*never*¬†spend the night at Lutzwater Heights. Not only did the prospect of sleeping here scare him, but it appeared like he believed he said something that he should not have. He abruptly shifted the conversation to finalizing his order. After signing the agreement, he excused himself to the restroom, allowing Charlie the opportunity to plant a small camera into the kitchen‚Äôs smoker detector.

*‚ÄúOkay gentleman,‚Äù*¬†Christian proclaimed as he returned from the bathroom, sitting down across from Charlie as he did,¬†*‚ÄúI believe we have negotiated the first part of the deal‚Ä¶‚Äù*

‚Äú*What other parts are there, sir?‚Äù*¬†Charlie interjected. Mr. Lutzwater had already signed and paid for the security system. The older thief turned to his left, looking to see his younger compatriot understood what Christian meant. But he was not at the table. Charlie darted his head wildly around its axis, trying to locate Theo had gotten off to. Just moments before, he‚Äôd been beside Charlie, yet there had been no sounds of a chair scraping or Theo‚Äôs footsteps to suggest he‚Äôd left the table while he was briefly distracted by Mr. Lutzwater‚Äôs return.

When Charlie‚Äôs gaze found its way back to Christian, terror bloomed thick and ravenous deep within his chest. His pulse quickened, blood vibrating ferociously through his entire body. He blinked over and over again, but the image in front of him did not change.

Without warning, Mr. Lutzwater‚Äôs face has evolved into something else entirely.

*‚ÄúYou know what I mean, Charlie. How many times have we had this conversation? I need your answer. I need your answer now.‚Äù*

The phrase seeped listlessly out of one Christian‚Äôs new cavities. All of his facial features had been replaced by three oval slits, overflowing with impenetrable, inky darkness. Two vertical slits run parallel to each other over the top two-thirds of his skull, with one horizontal slit laying flatly under the both of them on the bottom third. The steel-blue skin in between the holes was smooth and blemishless, but it appeared dangerously taut, like a plastic bag that had been filled to brim and was primed to split and rupture at any moment - or, maybe, that tightness had already caused the skin to break, resulting in the three slits that were currently staring at him.

Charlie‚Äôs aching psyche interpreted the slits as a face, but they looked just as much like the holes in a power outlet as they did two long eyes and one even longer mouth. Yes, language had come from it, but the words had not emanated from his so-called ""mouth"". Instead, the statement leaked out of what Charlie assumed was Christian‚Äôs new left eye, causing the crevasse to widen slightly and tremble as it did.

*‚ÄúYou made your request - a cure for loneliness. That is something we can provide, but at a cost. We will want the first of your bloodline, as payment for our generosity.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I‚Ä¶‚Äù*¬†Charlie blubbered.

In response to his indecision, all three slits began to ripple soundlessly, like a frustrated scream imperceptible to Charlie was being unleashed from all three orifices simultaneously.

Every night since the consultation, he had experienced the same nightmare. It always started as a memory, a replaying of events, but inevitably culminated with Christian‚Äôs transformation. But this was first one where he had actually answered the question. All the times before, the vision ended before he had made a decision.

For the remaining three days prior to the heist, Charlie‚Äôs sleep would be barren and nightmareless, but it would not be restful.

\------------

Each day, Theo checked the hidden camera‚Äôs recorded feed. In doing so, he determined that there may be something valuable secretly stored within the third-floor suite. In addition, he had confirmed that no one else currently lived inside Lutzwater Heights. No room had been rented out for at least half a decade.

Christian was not lying when he claimed that he visited the premises daily. Every day, about an hour before sundown like clockwork, Mr. Lutzwater would enter the apartment. Without wasting a second, he would pace over urgently to a painting on the wall. He would pull it aside, revealing that it was connected to the wall on a hinge. Because of the camera‚Äôs position, it was impossible to discern what lay beyond the painting; the camera‚Äôs angle hid that view. However, Christian very clearly took a key that hung around his neck, inserted it into something on the wall, and then reached in to the wall. To Theo, that meant there must be cash, jewelry, or something similarly worth our trouble concealed in that space.

Charlie squinted at the footage proudly displayed by Theo from his old and well-worn laptop. Something caught his eye that the younger thief had neglected to mention.

His lips were moving.

*‚ÄúWho do you think he‚Äôs talking to?‚Äù*¬†Charlie asked, praying that Theo had a good explanation.

*‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶he‚Äôs probably on a call. Bluetooth or something,‚Äù*¬†Theo replied while scratching the side of his head, clearly unbothered by the finding.

*‚ÄúHm. Yeah, I guess that makes sense.‚Äù*¬†Charlie halfheartedly remarked, lying mostly to himself in that moment. There was no evidence to back-up Theo‚Äôs deduction. Christian didn‚Äôt appear to have ear buds in, nor did he ever take out a phone to indicate he was taking a call, and whenever he was in that apartment, his lips were¬†*always*¬†moving.

But the camera never caught anyone else in that apartment, Charlie told himself.

Theo must be right.

It had a ""drink before"" date of just under a year, which alongside the fact that it produced quite a bit of crema, tells me it's been recently roasted.

Overall, I would say this one sits somewhere in between specialty roasted and good store bought coffee, which is great considering the price. And it's definitely better than a Lavazza and such.

Suffice it to say I went back and purchased 3 more bags that went directly into the fridge.

1h8fmlp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1h8fmlp/well_water/,Well Water,"***One:***

An awful, ungodly stench struck Charlie the moment he opened the creaking front door of the nearly abandoned apartment complex. He winced, reflexively jerking his face away from the entryway so that his lungs might find new air. The thief‚Äôs chest audibly rattled as he voraciously sucked in the atmosphere outside the doorway, hand still gripping the brass doorknob. Curious, Theo leaned into the building, inhaling a sample of the escaping vapors. With a chastising shake of his head, he exhaled, chuckling as he did. The younger of the two thieves ducked under Charlie‚Äôs arm and pushed forward, seizing the opportunity emasculate his colleague‚Äôs fragile sensibilities - teasing him for being so dumbstruck by an aroma. However, Theo‚Äôs chronic sinusitis had diminished his sense of smell, unbeknownst to his older colleague. So, despite Theo being able to detect the potent aroma, it was unable to restrain him like it did Charlie.

Theo admired Charlie as a mentor and felt a hint of jealousy towards him, so he found satisfaction in having something to hold over his head. His untimely demise in one of these flats would prevent Theo from ever disclosing this admiration.

‚Äú*C‚Äômon now, old man. No time to stop and smell the roses,*‚Äù Theo mocked, now leisurely strolling down the narrow, dimly lit lobby.

He wanted to move himself along, imaging himself running ahead to overtake Theo. But Charlie could not force his body through the partition and further into the corrosive scent, the intensity of which continued to increase as more stale air poured from the dilapidated building. Charlie struggled to identify what exactly could produce such a foul odor. It was acrid and gamey, reminiscent of meat spoiled in the summer sun; but at the same time, it also had a metallic and artificial quality, similar to the inside of a bustling factory. Stagnant, putrefied water closely resembled the stench, he considered, but it didn‚Äôt quite match.

Instead of following Theo in, Charlie raised a defiant middle finger as he bent over to retrieve the Vicks Vaporub from his backpack. From somewhere further down the hallway, he heard his partner flippantly squawk about Charlie‚Äôs feminine constitution. As he listened to the continued goading, Charlie could not fathom how Theo had developed such a bravado. The man was nearly as broke as he him, he had no girlfriend, and he carted around a body shaped like a neglected pear, one that had sat in the fruit bowl for a few too many days - rotting and sagging in all the wrong places. With Theo somehow *still* chattering on, Charlie sighed and smeared the waxy material over the crest of his upper lip as a barrier against the assaulting odor.

He wasn‚Äôt much better in comparison, though, Charlie lamented to himself. Gaunt and skeletal, he stood at a monstrous six foot seven inches. Though potentially commanding, his great height was offset by a total absence of muscle. Last time he checked, his weight clocked in at just shy of one hundred and twenty pounds. If Theo resembled a decaying pear, Charlie embodied an anemic popsicle stick. Perhaps, he mused, he and Theo were actually a perfect match - both objects that had well outlived their usefulness and only truly belonged at the heart of a landfill.

He at least possessed some companionship, he reflected, however meager it may be. Charlie could not stand the notion of being truly, utterly alone. He had grown to avoid it at all costs.

Protected from the disabling scent, Charlie took a beat to more thoroughly survey the street. Not that there was that much to see. The area was completely deserted and dilapidated, devoid of any sign of human habitation. That wasn‚Äôt always the case, though. Lutzwater boulevard used to represent the cornerstone of the city‚Äôs downtown, with this apartment complex acting as the linchpin that held it all together. Charlie relocated from the suburbs to the city at age ten, and could remember well the awe that the street‚Äôs opulence and glamour inspired when he rode his bike past with friends. A lot can change in thirty years, though. What remained was a mere shadow of what this place had once been. The many competing taverns and night clubs closed, the rowhomes that once contained up-and-coming senators and actors were derelict, and Lutzwater Heights, the nexus of it all, was almost empty. Only the son of the original owners, Christian, still resided inside, at least according to Theo‚Äôs contact.

Charlie didn‚Äôt let his eyes linger on any one part of Lutzwater boulevard for too long. The destruction was just too depressing, and in a certain sense, symbolic - the beauty of life and the promise of abundance in childhood turning to ash and shit as he aged.

One tiny piece of the deteriorating scenery, however, did strike Charlie in a way that gave him pause - it was something he had never noticed before. At its peak, Lutzwater Heights showcased an immaculately groomed front garden. Ochre and lavender flowers lined the entrance, greeting longtime residents, guests, and prospective residents of the prestigious building with an equal enthusiasm. Similar to the surrounding area, the garden had devolved into an abandoned wasteland, consisting only of overgrown shrubs and discarded liquor bottles. Close to his location at the stoop of the building, on the edge of the dead garden, however, sat a well that he did not recognize. He rode past the apartment complex thousands of times during his youth, and somehow never noticed the stone hatch with the accompanying wooden frame and bucket before now. The object‚Äôs presence was jarring against the backdrop of the dilapidated, contemporary architecture - and it would have been *even more* out of place when the location was at its prime. Now, it was able to partially conceal its uncanniness among the ruins. But thirty years ago, a pillory or a telephone booth sprouting out of the garden would have been less conspicuous than the well.

That said, it couldn‚Äôt have been new. To Charlie, that was infinitely more incomprehensible.

Another whiff of the horrible aroma broke his trance and reoriented Charlie to his current purpose on Lutzwater boulevard; Christian Lutzwater and his theoretical wealth. With information passed along from another career criminal, Theo believed there was a fortune hidden somewhere in the bubbling carcass of what *used* to be Lutzwater Heights, despite his parent‚Äôs real estate ventures going up in financial flames after their abrupt and cryptic disappearance over two decades ago.

*No idea how he could live with this fucking smell*,¬†Charlie thought, zipping his bag and placing the Vaporub in his coat pocket, assuming correctly that he would need to reapply the wax a few more times during their scheduled security system consultation/covert casing of the building and their target. Before following Theo into Lutzwater Heights, he rummaged through his wallet for coins to throw down the well, seeking to obtain good fortune from the pagan deities who might be able to affect the outcome of their so-called business venture. Without looking away from the inside of his wallet, he stood up and began to pace towards the well.

Unexpectedly, a sharp pain crackled from his big toe and radiated through his foot. Not paying attention, Charlie had slammed his boot into the well‚Äôs hard stone mid-stride. Apparently, he had misjudged his distance between the stoop, himself, and the well. Charlie felt sure that it had been a meter away, at least it had been before he started searching for coins, but the new throbbing discomfort sincerely disagreed with his previous assessment.

Apparently, the well was practically next to him.

Absentmindedly, he tossed the coins into the abyss without gazing into its inky depths. But as he did, pain and confusion had sidetracked his intended wish. Seeing Theo turn a corner and disappear from view, his mind was instead dragged back to its more fundamental concern as he provided the well with its tithe.

With his subconscious behind the wheel, Charlie wished to never be alone again.

As soon as the coins were swallowed by the blackness, the well instantly began to exude the ungodly odor, like fumes exploding from an exhaust pipe. Charlie didn‚Äôt understand what had changed, but he the let vapors propel him into action, finally sprinting to catch up with Theo. As he entered Lutzwater Heights, Charlie thought he heard the metal clink against the well‚Äôs bottom, but there was something off about that, too. The sound he heard wasn‚Äôt exactly that of a handful of coins briefly clattering against stone. Instead, a sort of quiet but frantic skittering emanated from somewhere in the darkness, like thousands of human nails tapping nervously against chalk - almost in perfect synchrony, but not quite.

\----------------------------------------------

***Two:***

Christian Lutzwater looked profoundly unwell. Huge, dark half-moons shadowed the flesh below his eyes, pulling his face down so much that he appeared unshakably joyless, the resulting creases injecting a deep gloom into every facial expression he could manifest. By Theo‚Äôs estimation, the man was only forty years old, but his emaciated cheeks and greying comb-over could have given anyone the impression that he was, at best, pushing sixty. Despite those features, his well-pressed, blue pin-stripe suit and solid black tie indicated he was still interested in appearances. At the kitchen table in the building‚Äôs largest suite, situated at the very back of the third floor, the thieves watched as Christian humbly brewed them a pot of coffee. As he did, Charlie clandestinely scanned the area, determining where they could install a remote camera or two when he wasn‚Äôt paying attention.

*‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶where do you need the cameras? In the entrance, the alleyways‚Ä¶?* Theo paused, hoping Christian would pick up where he left off.

Despite not being an employee at Charlie‚Äôs security agency, Theo seemed to enjoy steering the consultations, occasionally giving the impression to their soon-to-be victims that he ran the company or that security was a family business he grew up in. In actuality, Theo didn‚Äôt know the first thing about installing security systems. Yet, his self-assured manner brought the trust of their targets more often than it didn‚Äôt.

As long as Theo successfully pulled off the his part in the robberies while wearing the uniform Charlie stole for him, he happily relinquished control. Time and time again, the blueprint worked. From Charlie‚Äôs perspective, why mess with a good thing just to feed his ego?

The operation was both clever and profitable. The thieves would steal from their marks a few days *prior* to installing the purchased security systems, which helped them avoid suspicion. It was a simple and easy to execute plan: they would attend consultations with their marks, confirm that they had valuable belongings and no preexisting security measures, and then they would strike. The marks suspected their wealth needed better monitoring - that‚Äôs why they had reached out to Charlie‚Äôs company in the first place, so it was no surprise when a burglary actually came to pass. After many of their targets were robbed, their only lingering regret was that they had not called Theo and Charlie sooner, as they imagined a security system may have been able to prevent the financial losses.

*‚ÄúThere are several sewer grates around the periphery of the property, a majority of them near the parking lot, ""* Christian remarked matter-of-factly.

*‚ÄúI need them all covered by a remote video feed that I can have access to.‚Äù*

Theo, for all his virtues, did not have a talent for improvisation, and Christian‚Äôs answer had caught him off-guard. Stunned and at a loss, Theo turned to Charlie for help.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not sure that will cover the front gate or the entrance, Mr. Lutzwater.‚Äù* Charlie mumbled, who was also recovering from the overwhelming strangeness of his original response.

*Who the hell would try to enter the complex through the fucking sewers?*

From across the kitchen table, Christian set his pallid gaze on Charlie, visibly upset by the insinuation that he didn‚Äôt know what he wanted. He was not accustomed to being questioned by anyone, let alone by some a blue-collar nobody. Slowly, however, his expression melted from righteous indignation back to its baseline, sorrowful state. Only after a short time did Mr. Lutzwater grasp that his request could be seen as unreasonable to anyone unaware of what writhed within his apartment complex.

Feeling like the flow of conversation was back on track, Theo eagerly returned to the fold.

December 06, 2024 12:21 AM

by Brett Nierengarten

Round 1 of another NFR has come and gone and with most events closer than usual, it proved just how fast things can change inside the Thomas & Mack.

Bareback rider Weston Timberman had several big wins in his rookie season, Pendleton and Ponoka among them, but none were bigger than his 87-point ride to win Round 1 at his NFR debut. With the win, Timberman moved from No. 7 to No. 3 in the PRCA World Standings.

‚ÄúI came here with the confidence that no one can beat me, and I think I showed that tonight,‚Äù Timberman said. ‚ÄúI came here to do a job.‚Äù

In steer wrestling, a fired up Will Lummus stopped the clock at 3.7 seconds to break a tie between Rowdy Parrott and rookie Cash Robb as one of the last cowboys out. Lummus, who is now No. 2 in the World, has three Top 5 finishes in the NFR Average in the last five years and got things rolling in the right direction on Thursday night.

Reigning World Champions Tyler Wade and Wesley Thorp made waves in a faster-than-usual Round 1 of team roping, setting a Go-Round record with a 3.7-second run. Wade broke his own Round 1 record of 4.0 seconds, achieved with two different partners in 2014 and 2019. Wade/Thorp, who both entered Las Vegas No. 2, capitalized on a misstep by World Standings leaders Dustin Egusquiza and Levi Lord, who failed to record a time.

In saddle bronc riding, it was another reigning World Champion asserting himself as Zeke Thurston, who has also won the last two NFR Average titles as well, won the First Round. He was 86.5 points on Frontier Rodeo Coffee‚Äôs Yellowstone, which marked his 18th ride of 85 points or more in his last 21 outs at the Thomas & Mack. Thurston entered a little over $70,000 behind World No. 1 Damian Brennan and quickly trimmed that to $35,000.

‚ÄúI was excited to get in here and get this thing rolling,‚Äù Thurston said. ‚ÄúI just did my part, that‚Äôs a super consistent horse, very reliable.‚Äù

Riley Webb made it a run of three straight events where the reigning World Champion won the Go-Round. Webb was 7 flat to cruise to the win as the next closest time was Joel Harris‚Äô 7.7. It was Webb‚Äôs fourth time of 7.5 seconds or faster on 11 runs in his NFR career.

Webb came in one of the heavy hitters in the tie-down roping, ranked in the Top 4 alongside Shad Mayfield, Haven Meged, and Ty Harris, none of those three cowboys were in the money.

Hailey Kinsel may not be a reigning World Champion, but she does have four of them and could be poised to add another after a dominant Round 1 performance. Taking advantage of the top of the ground, Kinsel was 13.38, which would‚Äôve been the fourth-fastest time of the entire 2023 NFR. She won the Go-Round by more than two tenths and extended her lead in the WPRA World Standings to $39,000.

The bull riders put on a show to close down Round 1. Nine cowboys made the whistle, which is more than any round in either of the last two NFRs. At the top was Trey Kimzey with 87.5 points.

I was frustrated so I asked my dad for a sign hoping to make my day a little better. The bench I sat on had a small pile of leaves underneath it and a few stuck to my shoe.
I removed the leaves and noticed a small orgami bird stuck on my shoelace. It looked like play money at first but after I took it to my local bank, was stunned to learn that after unfolding it, ended up being a real $10 bill. When my dad was alive, he failed at origami but was fascinated by it. To me, this was a sign in being able to help me afford a new backpack. Wherever you are Dad, thank you for this unexpected holiday money.

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real¬¥ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls¬¥, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE¬¥ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you¬¥ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about.",1,1733529453.0,Neoplatonism,0,1.0,False

in the next appointment (which my psych changed to a phone appointment,) i told her the bad reaction i had with the ssris, and that I had stopped taking them. She asked me what I wanted to do now, I stated that i wanted to focus on treating the adhd with stimulants, and she asked me what doseage of ritalin i wanted. I was confused and just said ""the lowest dose."" She prescribed me 5mg once daily, told me to take it with food, then she asked me when to put me on her schedule for the next appointment.

1h8ffoe,https://i.redd.it/qae1q93qgb5e1.jpeg,"National Finals Rodeo: Round 1 Recap, Highlights, and Payouts","#Like always, the World Standings look different immediately following Round 1 of the NFR

December 06, 2024 12:21 AM

by Brett Nierengarten

Round 1 of another NFR has come and gone and with most events closer than usual, it proved just how fast things can change inside the Thomas & Mack.

Bareback rider Weston Timberman had several big wins in his rookie season, Pendleton and Ponoka among them, but none were bigger than his 87-point ride to win Round 1 at his NFR debut. With the win, Timberman moved from No. 7 to No. 3 in the PRCA World Standings.

‚ÄúI came here with the confidence that no one can beat me, and I think I showed that tonight,‚Äù Timberman said. ‚ÄúI came here to do a job.‚Äù

In steer wrestling, a fired up Will Lummus stopped the clock at 3.7 seconds to break a tie between Rowdy Parrott and rookie Cash Robb as one of the last cowboys out. Lummus, who is now No. 2 in the World, has three Top 5 finishes in the NFR Average in the last five years and got things rolling in the right direction on Thursday night.

Reigning World Champions Tyler Wade and Wesley Thorp made waves in a faster-than-usual Round 1 of team roping, setting a Go-Round record with a 3.7-second run. Wade broke his own Round 1 record of 4.0 seconds, achieved with two different partners in 2014 and 2019. Wade/Thorp, who both entered Las Vegas No. 2, capitalized on a misstep by World Standings leaders Dustin Egusquiza and Levi Lord, who failed to record a time.

In saddle bronc riding, it was another reigning World Champion asserting himself as Zeke Thurston, who has also won the last two NFR Average titles as well, won the First Round. He was 86.5 points on Frontier Rodeo Coffee‚Äôs Yellowstone, which marked his 18th ride of 85 points or more in his last 21 outs at the Thomas & Mack. Thurston entered a little over $70,000 behind World No. 1 Damian Brennan and quickly trimmed that to $35,000.

‚ÄúI was excited to get in here and get this thing rolling,‚Äù Thurston said. ‚ÄúI just did my part, that‚Äôs a super consistent horse, very reliable.‚Äù

Riley Webb made it a run of three straight events where the reigning World Champion won the Go-Round. Webb was 7 flat to cruise to the win as the next closest time was Joel Harris‚Äô 7.7. It was Webb‚Äôs fourth time of 7.5 seconds or faster on 11 runs in his NFR career.

Webb came in one of the heavy hitters in the tie-down roping, ranked in the Top 4 alongside Shad Mayfield, Haven Meged, and Ty Harris, none of those three cowboys were in the money.

Hailey Kinsel may not be a reigning World Champion, but she does have four of them and could be poised to add another after a dominant Round 1 performance. Taking advantage of the top of the ground, Kinsel was 13.38, which would‚Äôve been the fourth-fastest time of the entire 2023 NFR. She won the Go-Round by more than two tenths and extended her lead in the WPRA World Standings to $39,000.

The bull riders put on a show to close down Round 1. Nine cowboys made the whistle, which is more than any round in either of the last two NFRs. At the top was Trey Kimzey with 87.5 points.

The property is beautiful, but the beach was disappointing for swimming due to seaweed, stones, and murky water. Despite frequent cleaning, it was not enjoyable compared to other Mauritian beaches.

Tapasake and the √† la carte restaurants were excellent, but the buffet dinner felt cheap and lacked variety, as did the breakfast. It was often crowded with long waits for coffee or water. Also a breakfast there was only buffet option, I prefer the a la carte options they have at other properties. 


We had an issue at check-in with our room view, which didn‚Äôt match the room type we had booked. After some back and forth, we decided to upgrade to a beautiful beachfront suite with fantastic views. However, housekeeping was inconsistent, often requiring us to call for service, and turndown service was missed while we were at dinner. Generally lacking the type of service you would expect when staying in a suite. 

Service on the beach was slow, and water was only provided on request, rather than bottled drinks in a cooler. The concierge team was excellent, and they handled a booking issue well. The staff was incredibly supportive when I fell sick, and the on-site doctor helped a lot. The airport transfer and staff assistance in the airport were top-notch.

1h8fcq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalPhilosophy/comments/1h8fcq3/imperial_socialist_manifesto_discussion_feedback/,"Imperial Socialist Manifesto: Discussion, Feedback and Thoughts","Greetings all,

I have been working on a manifesto that is intended to be all encompassing and would love to discuss it and seek feedback on it. To be clear, I am not a megalomaniac, I'm not trying to be the next Marx, this is more of a personal project to construct my ideology thoroughly. I thought this to be a suitable forum to discuss it.

It is heavily inspired by and builds on Technocracy, and the modern Chinese and Singaporean systems, with a focus on governance systems, economic policy, and societal restructuring. It tries, to the degree that I can, to learn from the past decades. The fault lines that brought down the Soviet Union, the myriad issues faced by the west, and the successes of China.

It is divided into three sections:

1. Political, which deals with governance systems.
2. Economic, which shockingly enough, involves economic policy.
3. Societal, which covers a breadth of polices including social, justice, and media.
4. Lastly is some wrap up, justification, and most importantly, the objective.

Thus, without any further preamble, here is my work; I would greatly appreciate hearing your thoughts on it:

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Imperial Socialism

This manifesto defines its primary objective being to increase material living standards for all citizens across every echelon of society through sound governance, societal harmony, and progress.¬†

¬†

# Political System

Imperial Technocracy

¬†

The Imperial Technocracy is a meritocratic structure focused on stability, efficiency, and rational governance, led by experts for collective welfare. At its heart is the¬†Imperial Council, which¬†forms an executive which will govern the Res Publica, akin to a cabinet in modern countries but meritocratic instead of demagogic. Together they represent¬†**t**he¬†Meritocracy, the institutional alliance between the Imperial Civil Service (ICS), the Imperial Legions, the Judiciary, and the Science Directorate.¬†

¬†

The¬†Imperial Council¬†consists of seven members, each representing a key branch of the Meritocracy:

* Great Vizier/Viziera,¬†Mandate of the Imperial Treasury
* Magister/Magistra Militum, Imperial Legions
* Mandarin/Mandarina Paramount,¬†Mandate of the Exterior
* Mandarin/Mandarina Paramount, Mandate of the Interior
* Supreme Adjudicator/Adjudicatrix, Judiciary
* Director/Directrix, Science Directorate¬†
* Director/Directrix, Praetorian Guard

¬†

Each Council Member is selected by their Mandates. Each Mandate will have five candidates with the most proven empirical track records (as measured byperformance metrics¬†and material, observable effectiveness, fairness of performance metrics is enforced by the Praetorian Guard) and Mandate members will vote to choose one of them to take a seat at the Council.¬†

¬†

Performance metrics are commonly used in various sectors in the current system. Universities, Civil Service, corporate structures, military, research centres, et alia. Such measures are not perfect and refining them is a perpetual mission, however they do exist and will be implemented without the need for revolutionising them.¬†

¬†

In a form, this can be seen as a workers‚Äô democracy.¬†All members of these Mandates, from a clerk in the Treasury, a soldier in the army, to a newly graduated scientist, have an equal vote and can use it in their respective Mandate‚Äôs elections after a short probation period.¬†The ICS Mandates, diplomats, military officers, scientists, judicial experts et alia, are all specialists in their field and thus empowered to decide who among their best can lead them.¬†

¬†

Similar systems follow for positions at in sub-Mandate level, departments, offices, committees, et alia.¬†

¬†

Council positions last for¬†ten years¬†after which the Council Member¬†must retire. Though this can be extended for another five year term through a unanimous vote of the Council, followed by a departmental election where they need to win an 80% majority.¬†

¬†

Each Council Member¬†gets an extra vote on issues of their department. What parts of the agenda falls under whose domain is strictly defined prior to the meeting through a Council vote. It is taken in turns to determine if the issue falls under the domain of each Council Member¬†with a requirement of gaining a 4/7.¬†

¬†

¬†

Imperial Senate:

* There would also be a democratically elected Imperial Senate. Consisting of 1000 elected Senators representing constituencies of equal populations.¬†
* The Imperial Senate has the power to¬†vote on policies of their own and send them to the Council¬†for consideration. The Council is¬†obligated¬†to evaluate and vote on them. If rejected, the Meritocracy has to¬†explain¬†why to the Senate and public.¬†
* They¬†review and authorise¬†Meritocracy policies, offer advice, and if they are not satisfied, send the policy back for redrafting to the council two times before they must approve the policy.¬†
* Its primary function then is to¬†convey public opinion¬†to the Council in order to prevent them from becoming too detached from the populace they govern.¬†
* The Party that wins the most seats is invited by the Imperial Council to nominate a Consul/Consuless. The second largest party nominates the second Consul, unless the winning party wins an outright majority.¬†
* This also provides the spectacle of the election process, yet the Senate is not without its set of powers that are crucial for the responsible functioning of the state, accountability of the Council and raising ground level issues.¬†
* Public engagement with policy is encouraged as well as joining the Meritocracy to climb the ranks or vote in Mandate elections to change it if they want to.

¬†

¬†

Checks and balances:

* The respective Mandate of a Council Member can initiate a¬†vote of no confidence¬†at any time to depose the member, which now requires at least a 50%. A¬†vote of confidence¬†is held¬†each year¬†in their Mandate where they must win a 40% or higher to remain in power.
* If a Council Member¬†is considered to be insufficiently competent, honourable, or having integrity, or does not peruse the common interest, they can also be¬†voted out of office¬†by the other Council Members with a vote of 5/7. Doing so triggers a Mandate defence election where the accused must win an 80% majority or retire.¬†
* Furthermore, incompetence or corruption of a Council Member¬†can jeopardise the performance metrics and/or budgets of the others, thus resulting in incentive for all to harshly punish corruption. This also prevents the formation of personal loyalty between Council Members.¬†
* The Imperial Senate can also demand that a Council Member‚Äôs¬†performance is put under review, failure to meet pre-set standards (standards reviewed every five years) results in the Council Member¬†losing their seat and entering retirement.
* Imperial Socialism acknowledges that no system is incorruptible. However, corruption can be managed and suppressed through rigorous processes, checks and balances, and oversight.¬†

¬†

Praetorian Guard:

* The Praetorians have the mandate of¬†eternal vigilance, not on the citizenry but on the Politea‚Äôs¬†elite. They maintain oversight on the appointed governors, on wealthy magnates, on leaders of nationalised industries and SOEs, on military generals, and diplomatic emissaries on mission. They ensure that the ‚Äògreat and the good‚Äô, often the most susceptible to corruption, stay in line and work for the common good.¬†
* They operate strictly within the confines of the law but within it, they are sanctioned to ensure that no loophole, no exploitation, no manipulation of the system or abuse of power is permitted.
* No organisation is incorruptible so the Praetorians operate in small, decentralised cells¬†that keep watch on each other, and all report to and¬†receive orders from the Imperial Council, which have their own rigorous¬†checks and balances¬†as discussed previously.¬†
* Noteworthy that it is not the Praetorians‚Äô responsibility to oversee the Council, indeed, it is the Council that oversees the Praetorians. The Council‚Äôs accountability measures are different as discussed previously.¬†

¬†

¬†

Crisis Policy:

* In times of crisis, they may appoint one of them to be the¬†Vasilefs/Vasilissa. This should represent an existential or catastrophic crisis, though it need not be of a martial nature. For example, in times of a severe pandemic, the Director of Research would be named Vasilefs, in times of significant agitation for reform, the Mandarin Paramount of the Interior would be named Vasilefs and so forth.
* The position of Vasilefs needs a¬†5/7 vote¬†to be appointed and a¬†3/7 vote to be revoked¬†as a check against the Vasilefs overstaying his welcome.¬†
* Every year the Council will vote again to determine if the crisis is over and this also only needs a 3/7 vote.¬†

¬†

¬†¬†

Imperial Charter:

Core tenets:¬†Collectivism, materialism, anthropocentrism, universalism, and utilitarianism.¬†Citizens may believe what they wish (to a degree) but joining the Meritocracy or the Senate requires swearing an oath to uphold the Imperial Charter. ¬†

¬†

¬†

# Economic System

Market Socialism

* The system follows¬†market socialism¬†inspired by the People‚Äôs Republic of China, a system which lifted a billion people out of abject poverty.¬†
* It features¬†non-profit, tax funded state control over essential sectors¬†(energy, water, transport) as well as public-private¬†for-profit¬†State Owned Enterprises¬†(SOEs).¬†
* The shares of these public-private SOEs can be bought and sold but are ultimately controlled by the autonomous management teams from the ICS,¬†competing with private corporations in non-essential areas.¬†
* For public-private SOEs, the state acts like venture capital, setting them up with funding and direction. However, in the medium term, following an Initial Public Offering (IPO), these SOEs are expected to produce returns without government funding and compete efficiently against private organisations.¬†
* An SOE that fails in the long term will not be backed by the state and have to file bankruptcy proceedings.¬†
* Since an SOE remains under the control of an autonomous ICS team, they are also subject to the routine performance reviews and metric analysis that most of the ICS is. In addition, they must abide by principles of ethical corporate governance and work where possible for the common good while driving for profit. Failure to either deliver results or operate ethically will result in the ICS appointing a new team.¬†

¬†

Investment Policy:¬†

* It is the sacred duty and solemn obligation of the state to develop the living standards of its people. The Meritocracy is committed to that goal. There will be¬†vast state investment¬†programmes funded by taxation every year on¬†infrastructure, education, and entrepreneurial activity.¬†
* This is in line with both Market Socialism and¬†Keynsian Economics¬†as state investment is essential to boosting spending, creating jobs and spurring growth.¬†
* One area of particular focus would be in research where the Meritocracy commits to unprecedented state investment in the fields of artificial intelligence, genetic augmentation, nuclear fusion, and space exploration. The state commits to ensuring that¬†all shall benefit¬†from technological advancements, not just a select few, through universalist services.¬†

¬†

¬†

Taxation Policy:¬†

Sector-specific taxes¬†are levied on non-essential sectors (sport and entertainment sectors for example), with¬†lower taxes and tax breaks for education, research, and finance. Extra taxes are imposed on harmful vices such as fast food, carbonated beverages, smoking, alcohol, social media, nightclubs and so on, to fund social programs.¬†Inheritance tax exempted¬†for up to the upper-middle class (income of up to 500k or net worth under 100M), supporting wealth transfer as a right. Heavy inheritance tax maintained on the upper class. 1% annual wealth tax for individuals with a net worth over one billion GBP.¬†

Additionally, a¬†US style system¬†ties taxation to both citizenship and residency. Therefore, even if a citizen leaves the country or has off shore assets, they still pay taxes on relevant assets and incomes.¬†

¬†

Income tax¬†(in GBP)¬†aims to reduce burden on the middle class and ensuring that everyone contributes their fair share:

* 0-20k: 1% tax (new bracket, up from 0%)
* 20k-50k: 20% tax (same as UK 2024)
* 50k-90k: 30% tax (lowered from 40%)
* 90k-150k: 40% tax (lowered from 45% for 125k-150k)
* 150k-500k: 45% tax (same as UK 2024)
* 500k-1M: 50% tax (new bracket)
* 1M+: 60% tax (new bracket)

¬†

Capital Flight Policy:

Attempted capital flight will result in total asset confiscation in the country. It is to be understood by the billionaire class that their enterprises in the country are possible due to the infrastructure of the state, and failure to contribute would result in consequences. They are free to leave and pay no taxes if they wish, but all assets (portfolios, companies, vehicles, stocks, real estate,¬†personal items,¬†equipment, etc) would be confiscated by the state, they are then free to rebuild from scratch elsewhere through their allegedly inherent talent. Process overseen by the Praetorian Guard.¬†¬†

¬†

¬†

Public Housing Policy:¬†

Modelled after Singapore‚Äôs¬†Housing Development Board¬†(HDB), including Singapore‚Äôs ethnic quotas¬†ethnic quotas. Funding is sourced from all the new taxes introduced.

¬†

¬†

Immigration Restructuring:¬†

* Significantly¬†reduces bloat in the sector, cuts red tape, and streamlines processes.¬†
* Work visas are issued and coordinated by the ICS instead of companies, with permanent residency (PR) granted after four years and citizenship after five. International students with a first class degree automatically offered PR.¬†
* Critical sector workers, such as in health or care sectors, benefit from tax cuts and higher wages to prevent brain drain, and asylum applications are processed through embassies and designated centres. The Meritocracy will not shirk its human rights obligations.¬†
* Immigration structures to be defined by economic and anthropocentrist considerations, not nationalism.¬†
* Aims for open borders long-term.¬†

¬†

¬†

Intellectual Property Restructuring:¬†

* Patents and copyrights are abolished. Trademarks are kept in a limited capacity only. Instead IP is replaced by the¬†Intellectual Achievement Prize, where the an individual who accomplishes a task of the intellectual nature, whether that be in the sciences or literature, is given a¬†yearly state stipend¬†which scales proportional to the assessed benefit to society (sciences) as determined by the Science Directorate or creative potential (literature) as determined by the Department of Culture.¬†
* The idea is then made¬†open source public property. This approach pushes for¬†innovation¬†through more open technological access and creative expressions of existing ideas. The creator of the idea is free to attempt to pursue profits in the market through it, creators still would have¬†First Mover Advantage, but they don‚Äôt have exclusive access and everyone can use it.¬†
* However, if an idea turns out to be significantly more groundbreaking than the Science Directorate or the Department of Culture had expected, the creator is entitled to proportionally higher stipend and compensation.¬†
* This restructuring aims to combine the monetary incentives of Intellectual Property with the cumulative benefits of open source. The Soviet Union demonstrated in the past that it is possible to push the boundaries of science and technology without IP laws. This system optimises and builds upon that idea while incorporating monetary incentives.

¬†

¬†

Energy Policy:¬†

* The state will primarily rely on¬†nuclear fission¬†to generate its energy.¬†Renewable¬†sources could also be used for the sake of¬†diversification.¬†
* Fossil fuel based energy generation will be phased out rapidly through regulation, taxation and large scale nuclear and renewable construction programmes through state initiatives and public-private SOEs.¬†
* Countries like France have proven this can work. This is until¬†nuclear fusion¬†has matured into a technology that would¬†fuel the human race with the power of a star.¬†

¬†

¬†

Union Policy:

* Imperial Socialism recognises Trade Unions as an important tool to defend workers‚Äô rights. The¬†right to industrial action against private exploitation is recognised. Unions are to be coordinate with the ICS Mandate their profession falls under and be advised by officials appointed by the Mandate. The right of private employees to industrial action is viewed by the state as an additional check against corporate power.
* Unions in government institutions have the right to industrial action so far as it does not result in harm to the citizenry. Where it does, such as in medicine or public transport, limitations are placed on industrial action. Whether industrial action could potentially cause harm is assessed by a workforce-interdepartmental interface committee.¬†
* Since public sector workers are part of the department itself, they are instead encouraged to¬†make use of departmental mechanisms¬†previously outlined to put pressure on their Council Member¬†over industrial action. Their votes wield significant power and it is preferred that they use them over industrial action. Ultimately, workers in these departments are considered¬†part of the Meritocracy¬†and will always be compensated accordingly when the system works as intended.

¬†

¬†

¬†

# Societal System

Social Policy:¬†

* Imperial Socialism knows that ‚Äúwomen hold up half the sky‚Äù and thus will ensure that¬†Gender equality is prioritised, ensuring equity for women and¬†rejecting any form of misogyny, nationalism, or religiosity. Every measure¬†will be taken to bring about¬†absolute equality for women, including a 50-50 balance in the Meritocracy. Commissions, potentially including female only committees, will be set up to investigate if quotas are necessary.¬†
* Imperial Socialism¬†opposes identity politics¬†and inter-sectionalism, just as socialism of old had, viewing them as¬†an expression of regressive hyper-individualism and consumerism¬†that detracts from the universalist and collectivist ideals that shall guide our human race.¬†
* Instead, Imperial Socialism promotes universalism, and takes active steps toward it.
* Age gaps over 5 years are taxed, with the tax proportional to the gap to promote equality and raise revenue. Both the man and woman involved are taxed regardless of who is older.¬†Infidelity is a crime that results in a fine to promote fidelity and raise revenue. Fines proportional to wealth.¬†
* The state promotes an egalitarian nucelar family model akin to those of Soviet and Chinese societies, based on the concept of Societal Harmony to encourage equality, loyalty, monogamy, and stable partnerships without regressive connotations.¬†
* Deviancy and bourgeois degeneracy is taxed.¬†
* Social Media and Nightclubs¬†are¬†pressured into passing the cost onto customers through¬†heavy taxes. Tax funded projects initiate¬†large scale construction of public amenities¬†and socialising programs to encourage interaction in person. This would include things like festivals, social centres, state owned cafes which¬†facilitate meeting new people,¬†social amenities, et alia. Event organisers will make it easy to meet new people.¬†
* This measure aims to repair the fragmentation of society and over-reliance on corporate social media which was built off of algorithmic practices that encouraged addiction.¬†

¬†¬†

¬†

Justice¬†Restructuring:¬†

* The issues of prison¬†overcrowding, spiralling spending, and recidivism¬†are tackled.¬†
* Jail is¬†reserved for heinous crimes¬†like murder, rape, paedophillia, sex trafficking, treason, et alia, as the existing system is costly, traumatising, dehumanising, and promotes recidivism rather than rehabilitation.
* ¬†Minor offences are addressed through¬†wealth-proportional fines.
* ¬†White-collar crime¬†incurs¬†catastrophic penalties, including, at the¬†most severe level, complete asset confiscation and ruinous fines. Such severity is¬†necessitated¬†by this type of crime¬†damaging trust¬†in systems that allow for stability and prosperity, as well as reducing¬†market efficiency.¬†
* The hyper-rich are prevented from hiding their wealth by having them register all assets at all times (common practice currently) and additionally, the¬†onus is on them to pay the fine, which at the highest level could equal most of their net worth, by whatever means necessary.¬†Failing to do so by hiding wealth results in being sentenced to the VLC.¬†
* An individual can also join the¬†Voluntary Labour Corps (VLC)¬†instead of paying the fine or if an individual cannot pay the fine, where offenders¬†pay off their debt¬†to society by contributing their manual labour. It allows¬†rehabilitation¬†through state infrastructure work while allowing individuals to¬†return home¬†daily and¬†maintain their dignity.¬†A key factor is to avoid isolating and alienating the minor offender from society.¬†
* The VLC offers pay, a stable job, discipline and a commendation that can be put on the former minor offender‚Äôs¬†CV. Having served there is not stigmatised but a mark of having done public service and demonstrated discipline, teamwork, organisation and hard work.¬†
* Simultaneously, this system greatly¬†reduces the load on state finances¬†for holding these minor offenders in jail, provides a cost efficient labour force and reforms more individuals than a prison would have.¬†
* This need not be an excessively long sentence, even just a few days to a few weeks at the lowest levels, to years, scaling with crime.¬†
* Major offenders guilty of heinous crimes such as rape, murder, paedophilia, treason to the species, et alia, serve in the VLC permanently, and are considered to be the¬†Damned. They work in harsher conditions without pay, living in prison camps and contributing to demanding projects without parole, acting as a punishment, deterrent and utility. They are overseen by armed commissars to ensure compliance.¬†
* Wrongful convictions result in massive compensation, incentivising judicial accuracy.

Oldest Vices Policy:

* Imperial Socialism acknowledges that the three vices of drugs, gambling and prostitution are as¬†old as human history¬†and cannot easily be wiped out. However, they can be¬†brought to heel¬†and managed for the common good.¬†
* Private establishments have to undergo constant and rigorous tests. Any evidence of abuse, whether of workers or otherwise, results in harsh crackdowns.¬†
* Prostitution is heavily taxed to generate revenue. It is expected that infidelity fines will also generate strong revenue from this sector, unfortunately but not without its utility.
* Gambling is also legalised but¬†heavily taxed to generate revenue.¬†
* Exploitative or addictive practices result in closure of the gambling site, seizure of all assets and heavy fines for all involved. Science Directorate mathematicians will be routinely inspect the probabilities involved behind each gambling mechanism to check for fairness, among other security checks.¬†
* Both prostitution and gambling will be heavily regulated by the state and under constant oversight by the Mandate of the Interior (Mandate of the ICS) as well as the Judiciary.¬†
* The Science Directorate will assess each drug and determine whether or not it constitutes a significant health risk, in both the long and short terms.¬†
* The drugs determined to be within manageable parameters are legalised and strictly controlled through a regulated system managed by the ICS where access is limited in accordance with health risks and prices are fair while allowing profit to the state to fund other activities.¬†
* This policy ensures that those that seek drugs will only receive them under controlled, medically approved conditions as well as safe substances.¬†
* Harsh and overwhelming crackdown against illegal substances and all who distribute and consume them. Participating in the illegal drug trade results in an automatic sentencing to the VLC for a significant period.

¬†

¬†

Media Policy:

* Freedom of speech is a fundamental right¬†that will be defended by the Meritocracy, in so far as it does not damage the public good.¬†
* Harming the public good is defined as inciting violence or promoting extremist ideologies (hyper-nationalism, religious zealotry, sexism are template examples). The exact definitions will be laid out by the¬†Judiciary. Such a caveat is common practice in mature systems such as Canada and Germany.¬†
* Principled¬†opposition, whether public or personal, to and criticism of Meritocracy policy is¬†protected by the state.
* Private media can operate freely, however adherence to factual information is legally binding, failure to do so results in severe fines. Outright lies and¬†misinformation will be harshly penalised.¬†Fines proportional to company size.¬†
* Private ownership over media is regulated for the common good.¬†No one person is to dominate entire outlets¬†with the goal of manipulating public sentiment as we have observed with the Murdoch Empire. The amount of stake an individual can hold in a new corporation after it passes a certain size is limited, encouraged a wide range of investors to be shareholders. This¬†combats monopolisation¬†and domination of corporate structures that could hinder the¬†free market.¬†
* The state will run¬†two media outlets, one that is¬†favourable¬†to the Meritocracy‚Äôs policies and one that is¬†critical. Both will always receive equal funding and regularly host debates between senators, civil officials, activists, independent experts et alia.
* Experts of course, even in The Meritocracy, would rarely have consensus on policy. The Meritocracy would generally follow the directive of the Imperial Council, but there will be swathes of experts who disagree. They will be given a voice through this critical media outlet.¬†
* Free access to the internet¬†is enshrined in the law. Only websites that are judged to be breaking the law by the Judiciary can be blocked.

¬†

¬†

Floor Provision Policy:¬†

Basic necessities, including education, internet, housing, utilities, and healthcare, are to be provided¬†universally¬†in the medium-term, funded by taxes to¬†encourage spending¬†on more sophisticated activities that better drive the economy economy better such as¬†hobbies, fine dining, technology,¬†et alia.¬†

Nomenclature:

Imperial Socialism has a broad scope, redefining society and ideology itself, therefore its nomenclature must reflect that. A key goal is to redirect the loyalty of the populace from current tribalistic fault lines, ie religion, nationalism, populism, et alia, towards the system built here and allow them to place their trust in it for their well being. This requires a certain level of grandiosity to inspire faith and a sense of awe. An idea that the system¬†will¬†work and it will work for them. Hence why the names chosen must be as they are. A secretary is someone who the population identifies as one that fetches their coffee and writes the minutes. But a mandarin is a scholar-bureaucrat who can truly govern.¬†

Similarly, a committee conjures images of red tape and bureaucratic clog, while the Meritocracy, or the Imperial Council, or the Mandates of the Civil Service, are monolithic institutions of unassailable authority. However, this grandiosity has to be, and is, tempered with the knowledge that each of these systems operates according to stringent checks and balances, and that anyone with the merit can and will rise in them.¬†

¬†

Iconography:

The¬†Meritocracy Iconography¬†features a black background with a double headed golden eagle, holding a red hammer and sickle, with glowing red eyes, and a red UN symbol surrounded by red laurel wreathes, embodying the Meritocracy‚Äôs ideals.

¬†

# Objective:¬†

At the core of Imperial Socialism is the acknowledgement of a fundamental truth that is as incontrovertible as it is immutable: the **Oneness of the Human Race**. Humankind is one species by any valid definition, may that be scientific, historical, material, anthropological, or philosophical. Yet, for aeons we have been divided by creeds that benefit from ceaseless strife, bound by the chains of borders, superstitions, and demagogues.

Our species faces a choice. We can continue to fester in the bile of tribalism, fight, kill, main, murder, persecute, and slaughter our own kind until we face our inevitable extinction. A blip in the history of the cosmos. Glorified apes that wasted our potential.¬†

Or we can transcend these divisions, and work towards unification. To reach for the stars, to fulfil what we as a species excel at. Expand, learn, adapt. To leave the confines of our Motherland and seize our destiny.

Imperial Socialism will eradicate all divisive identities‚Äînational, racial, or religious‚Äîto achieve a cohesive, universal human identity: Terran. The erasure of old identities is a policy to be pursued subtly and slowly but inexorably, to dismantle them over time through housing ethnic quotas, tax policy, school quotas, interracial marriages, state atheism, cultural directives, education campaigns, et alia.¬†

Imperial Socialism will shatter the shackles that have bound our kind, our bodies and our minds. It will take time, and it will not be easy, nor would it be immediately utopian. But it will also be necessary if our species is to have a future worthy of the term.

Awful night last night. I couldn't do much of anything so no panhandling. No money for my first cup of coffee which you can get free refills for after that. But I needed water for my food poisoning so I've just been chugging water all day. 

I get the bright idea to wait until shift change and go ask for a refill on a coffee I never bought. Yeah I know some monstrous shit, but hey man, life sucks right now and a cup of Joe would do a lot for me. Anyway, I go up and try. The lady asks me what I had, I say a cup of coffee, she asks if I have the cup, I say no. I said I must have thrown it away. I didn't want to put her in a weird spot though so I was just immediately like, ""oh hey it's no problem, can I just get a water?"" And she was like ""yeah no problem""

So I get my water and go back to my corner that's situated kinda around the corner where they can't see me. Not intentionally, that was just the open seat when I first got there. So I'm screwing around on my phone for about another hour and that same lady just kinda appears from around the corner like a bolt of lightning, hurriedly putting the lid on the cup.

She says, ""hey so we made this anyway and if you'd like..."" as she's saying this she fumbls the whole cup and kinda launches it at me, exploding across the table and literally covering the whole floor around me. I must have had a forcefield because somehow almost none of it hit me, my phone or my bag. Only a little bit got on the edge of my shoe. 

Of course, she starts profusely apologizing and I'm like ""no no you're fine, you didn't even get me. I appreciate the thought so much"" and started moving my things away while she hurriedly cleaned everything around me. I could feel the embarrassment radiating off her. She was like ""they're remaking that now I'm so sorry"" and I'm just like ""oh, thank you so much! That's very kind!"" 

I absolutely didn't expect them to remake it, but in hindsight she was just trying to give me a cup because, I mean, they know damn well I'm homeless. I've been here like all day for the past 4 days or something, with my big ass bag. But yeah. They remade the coffee and gave it to me and I probably thanked her too much. Told her this is everything and she was just like I'm sorry I'm sorry. 

There's a lot of really good people in the world man. I would be fucked, for instance, if they had all got tired of me being here and told me to leave at any point in the last few days. There's literally nowhere around me to go to stay warm into the night, till it's time for bed. And I wasnt lying, that coffee made my whole damn day.",12,1733529018.0,homeless,19,1.0,False

As a little extra information, I don't have Porsche connect or Porsche charging service. But I still have the expectation with My Porsche app set up, the car linked to my Porsche ID and a payment option configured to have a frictionless experience. 

So when I drove up to the charging lounge I checked in with the app so the gates opened and I could drive in. It was nice that the license plate was detected and I didn't have to open the window. 

But then I tried to charge and it went down from there. There was no direct payment option at the charging station. I could only charge through the app, following the link of the QR Code or within Porsche charging service NFC chip. So I've tried using the app but it only redirected me to website to register. Which I did but immediately after I gave it all my information and credit card numbers redirected me to the start page. So instead, I've used the QR Code directly I could configure the exact charging cable that I was using, but when trying to give my credit card details there the same thing happened. 

I got charged for ‚Ç¨100 and immediately got redirected to the start screen charging was not possible and none of my information was stored anywhere. So I've tried repeating the same process three times tediously entering all my information again and again and in total paid ‚Ç¨300(which hopefully I get back soon) with no success of charging my car at all. 

So I went into the cabin drank a coffee went to the toilet and just drove back and charged somewhere else. 

All the buildings charging station toilets, room where I can just sit charger your phone drink a coffee it's really nice. But why can't they make the charging experience better? Using an electric car in Germany always feels like people actually don't want you to use electric cars. 

Just let me add my credit card info to the app link it to my Porsche ID and detect me automatically when I plug in the charging cable. Why do I even need to configure anything on the station? This is a really frustrating experience and not the first one that I already had in my quite short history with electric cars.",2,1733528906.0,Taycan,0,1.0,False

1h8f9od,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateCommunism/comments/1h8f9od/imperial_socialist_manifesto_discussion_and/,Imperial Socialist Manifesto: Discussion and Thoughts,"Greetings all,

So, I am not entirely sure if this is the right place to post this as I want to discuss rather than strictly debate (though I don't doubt there would be disagreements) my ideas. I mainly want to hear thoughts on it from the perspective of fellow leftists.

I have been working on a manifesto that is intended to be all encompassing and would love to discuss it. To be clear, I am not a megalomaniac, I'm not trying to be the next Marx, this is more of a personal project to construct my ideology thoroughly. I thought this to be a suitable forum to discuss it.

It is heavily inspired by and builds on Technocracy, and the modern Chinese and Singaporean systems, with a focus on governance systems, economic policy, and societal restructuring. It tries, to the degree that I can, to learn from the past decades. The unfortunate fault lines that brought down the Union, the myriad (often predictable) issues faced by the bourgeois west, and the incredible success of China.

It is divided into three sections:

1. Political, which deals with governance systems.
2. Economic, which shockingly enough, involves economic policy.
3. Societal, which covers a breadth of polices including social, justice, and media.
4. Lastly is some wrap up, justification, and most importantly, the objective.

Thus, without any further preamble, here is my work; I would greatly appreciate hearing your thoughts on it:

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Imperial Socialism

This manifesto defines its primary objective being to increase material living standards for all citizens across every echelon of society through sound governance, societal harmony, and progress.¬†

¬†

# Political System

Imperial Technocracy

¬†

The Imperial Technocracy is a meritocratic structure focused on stability, efficiency, and rational governance, led by experts for collective welfare. At its heart is the¬†Imperial Council, which¬†forms an executive which will govern the Res Publica, akin to a cabinet in modern countries but meritocratic instead of demagogic. Together they represent¬†**t**he¬†Meritocracy, the institutional alliance between the Imperial Civil Service (ICS), the Imperial Legions, the Judiciary, and the Science Directorate.¬†

¬†

The¬†Imperial Council¬†consists of seven members, each representing a key branch of the Meritocracy:

* Great Vizier/Viziera,¬†Mandate of the Imperial Treasury
* Magister/Magistra Militum, Imperial Legions
* Mandarin/Mandarina Paramount,¬†Mandate of the Exterior
* Mandarin/Mandarina Paramount, Mandate of the Interior
* Supreme Adjudicator/Adjudicatrix, Judiciary
* Director/Directrix, Science Directorate¬†
* Director/Directrix, Praetorian Guard

¬†

Each Council Member is selected by their Mandates. Each Mandate will have five candidates with the most proven empirical track records (as measured byperformance metrics¬†and material, observable effectiveness, fairness of performance metrics is enforced by the Praetorian Guard) and Mandate members will vote to choose one of them to take a seat at the Council.¬†

¬†

Performance metrics are commonly used in various sectors in the current system. Universities, Civil Service, corporate structures, military, research centres, et alia. Such measures are not perfect and refining them is a perpetual mission, however they do exist and will be implemented without the need for revolutionising them.¬†

¬†

In a form, this can be seen as a workers‚Äô democracy.¬†All members of these Mandates, from a clerk in the Treasury, a soldier in the army, to a newly graduated scientist, have an equal vote and can use it in their respective Mandate‚Äôs elections after a short probation period.¬†The ICS Mandates, diplomats, military officers, scientists, judicial experts et alia, are all specialists in their field and thus empowered to decide who among their best can lead them.¬†

¬†

Similar systems follow for positions at in sub-Mandate level, departments, offices, committees, et alia.¬†

¬†

Council positions last for¬†ten years¬†after which the Council Member¬†must retire. Though this can be extended for another five year term through a unanimous vote of the Council, followed by a departmental election where they need to win an 80% majority.¬†

¬†

Each Council Member¬†gets an extra vote on issues of their department. What parts of the agenda falls under whose domain is strictly defined prior to the meeting through a Council vote. It is taken in turns to determine if the issue falls under the domain of each Council Member¬†with a requirement of gaining a 4/7.¬†

¬†

¬†

Imperial Senate:

* There would also be a democratically elected Imperial Senate. Consisting of 1000 elected Senators representing constituencies of equal populations.¬†
* The Imperial Senate has the power to¬†vote on policies of their own and send them to the Council¬†for consideration. The Council is¬†obligated¬†to evaluate and vote on them. If rejected, the Meritocracy has to¬†explain¬†why to the Senate and public.¬†
* They¬†review and authorise¬†Meritocracy policies, offer advice, and if they are not satisfied, send the policy back for redrafting to the council two times before they must approve the policy.¬†
* Its primary function then is to¬†convey public opinion¬†to the Council in order to prevent them from becoming too detached from the populace they govern.¬†
* The Party that wins the most seats is invited by the Imperial Council to nominate a Consul/Consuless. The second largest party nominates the second Consul, unless the winning party wins an outright majority.¬†
* This also provides the spectacle of the election process, yet the Senate is not without its set of powers that are crucial for the responsible functioning of the state, accountability of the Council and raising ground level issues.¬†
* Public engagement with policy is encouraged as well as joining the Meritocracy to climb the ranks or vote in Mandate elections to change it if they want to.

¬†

¬†

Checks and balances:

* The respective Mandate of a Council Member can initiate a¬†vote of no confidence¬†at any time to depose the member, which now requires at least a 50%. A¬†vote of confidence¬†is held¬†each year¬†in their Mandate where they must win a 40% or higher to remain in power.
* If a Council Member¬†is considered to be insufficiently competent, honourable, or having integrity, or does not peruse the common interest, they can also be¬†voted out of office¬†by the other Council Members with a vote of 5/7. Doing so triggers a Mandate defence election where the accused must win an 80% majority or retire.¬†
* Furthermore, incompetence or corruption of a Council Member¬†can jeopardise the performance metrics and/or budgets of the others, thus resulting in incentive for all to harshly punish corruption. This also prevents the formation of personal loyalty between Council Members.¬†
* The Imperial Senate can also demand that a Council Member‚Äôs¬†performance is put under review, failure to meet pre-set standards (standards reviewed every five years) results in the Council Member¬†losing their seat and entering retirement.
* Imperial Socialism acknowledges that no system is incorruptible. However, corruption can be managed and suppressed through rigorous processes, checks and balances, and oversight.¬†

¬†

Praetorian Guard:

* The Praetorians have the mandate of¬†eternal vigilance, not on the citizenry but on the Politea‚Äôs¬†elite. They maintain oversight on the appointed governors, on wealthy magnates, on leaders of nationalised industries and SOEs, on military generals, and diplomatic emissaries on mission. They ensure that the ‚Äògreat and the good‚Äô, often the most susceptible to corruption, stay in line and work for the common good.¬†
* They operate strictly within the confines of the law but within it, they are sanctioned to ensure that no loophole, no exploitation, no manipulation of the system or abuse of power is permitted.
* No organisation is incorruptible so the Praetorians operate in small, decentralised cells¬†that keep watch on each other, and all report to and¬†receive orders from the Imperial Council, which have their own rigorous¬†checks and balances¬†as discussed previously.¬†
* Noteworthy that it is not the Praetorians‚Äô responsibility to oversee the Council, indeed, it is the Council that oversees the Praetorians. The Council‚Äôs accountability measures are different as discussed previously.¬†

¬†

¬†

Crisis Policy:

* In times of crisis, they may appoint one of them to be the¬†Vasilefs/Vasilissa. This should represent an existential or catastrophic crisis, though it need not be of a martial nature. For example, in times of a severe pandemic, the Director of Research would be named Vasilefs, in times of significant agitation for reform, the Mandarin Paramount of the Interior would be named Vasilefs and so forth.
* The position of Vasilefs needs a¬†5/7 vote¬†to be appointed and a¬†3/7 vote to be revoked¬†as a check against the Vasilefs overstaying his welcome.¬†
* Every year the Council will vote again to determine if the crisis is over and this also only needs a 3/7 vote.¬†

¬†

¬†¬†

Imperial Charter:

Core tenets:¬†Collectivism, materialism, anthropocentrism, universalism, and utilitarianism.¬†Citizens may believe what they wish (to a degree) but joining the Meritocracy or the Senate requires swearing an oath to uphold the Imperial Charter. ¬†

¬†

¬†

# Economic System

Market Socialism

* The system follows¬†market socialism¬†inspired by the People‚Äôs Republic of China, a system which lifted a billion people out of abject poverty.¬†
* It features¬†non-profit, tax funded state control over essential sectors¬†(energy, water, transport) as well as public-private¬†for-profit¬†State Owned Enterprises¬†(SOEs).¬†
* The shares of these public-private SOEs can be bought and sold but are ultimately controlled by the autonomous management teams from the ICS,¬†competing with private corporations in non-essential areas.¬†
* For public-private SOEs, the state acts like venture capital, setting them up with funding and direction. However, in the medium term, following an Initial Public Offering (IPO), these SOEs are expected to produce returns without government funding and compete efficiently against private organisations.¬†
* An SOE that fails in the long term will not be backed by the state and have to file bankruptcy proceedings.¬†
* Since an SOE remains under the control of an autonomous ICS team, they are also subject to the routine performance reviews and metric analysis that most of the ICS is. In addition, they must abide by principles of ethical corporate governance and work where possible for the common good while driving for profit. Failure to either deliver results or operate ethically will result in the ICS appointing a new team.¬†

¬†

Investment Policy:¬†

* It is the sacred duty and solemn obligation of the state to develop the living standards of its people. The Meritocracy is committed to that goal. There will be¬†vast state investment¬†programmes funded by taxation every year on¬†infrastructure, education, and entrepreneurial activity.¬†
* This is in line with both Market Socialism and¬†Keynsian Economics¬†as state investment is essential to boosting spending, creating jobs and spurring growth.¬†
* One area of particular focus would be in research where the Meritocracy commits to unprecedented state investment in the fields of artificial intelligence, genetic augmentation, nuclear fusion, and space exploration. The state commits to ensuring that¬†all shall benefit¬†from technological advancements, not just a select few, through universalist services.¬†

¬†

¬†

Taxation Policy:¬†

Sector-specific taxes¬†are levied on non-essential sectors (sport and entertainment sectors for example), with¬†lower taxes and tax breaks for education, research, and finance. Extra taxes are imposed on harmful vices such as fast food, carbonated beverages, smoking, alcohol, social media, nightclubs and so on, to fund social programs.¬†Inheritance tax exempted¬†for up to the upper-middle class (income of up to 500k or net worth under 100M), supporting wealth transfer as a right. Heavy inheritance tax maintained on the upper class. 1% annual wealth tax for individuals with a net worth over one billion GBP.¬†

Additionally, a¬†US style system¬†ties taxation to both citizenship and residency. Therefore, even if a citizen leaves the country or has off shore assets, they still pay taxes on relevant assets and incomes.¬†

¬†

Income tax¬†(in GBP)¬†aims to reduce burden on the middle class and ensuring that everyone contributes their fair share:

* 0-20k: 1% tax (new bracket, up from 0%)
* 20k-50k: 20% tax (same as UK 2024)
* 50k-90k: 30% tax (lowered from 40%)
* 90k-150k: 40% tax (lowered from 45% for 125k-150k)
* 150k-500k: 45% tax (same as UK 2024)
* 500k-1M: 50% tax (new bracket)
* 1M+: 60% tax (new bracket)

¬†

Capital Flight Policy:

Attempted capital flight will result in total asset confiscation in the country. It is to be understood by the billionaire class that their enterprises in the country are possible due to the infrastructure of the state, and failure to contribute would result in consequences. They are free to leave and pay no taxes if they wish, but all assets (portfolios, companies, vehicles, stocks, real estate,¬†personal items,¬†equipment, etc) would be confiscated by the state, they are then free to rebuild from scratch elsewhere through their allegedly inherent talent. Process overseen by the Praetorian Guard.¬†¬†

¬†

¬†

Public Housing Policy:¬†

Modelled after Singapore‚Äôs¬†Housing Development Board¬†(HDB), including Singapore‚Äôs ethnic quotas¬†ethnic quotas. Funding is sourced from all the new taxes introduced.

¬†

¬†

Immigration Restructuring:¬†

* Significantly¬†reduces bloat in the sector, cuts red tape, and streamlines processes.¬†
* Work visas are issued and coordinated by the ICS instead of companies, with permanent residency (PR) granted after four years and citizenship after five. International students with a first class degree automatically offered PR.¬†
* Critical sector workers, such as in health or care sectors, benefit from tax cuts and higher wages to prevent brain drain, and asylum applications are processed through embassies and designated centres. The Meritocracy will not shirk its human rights obligations.¬†
* Immigration structures to be defined by economic and anthropocentrist considerations, not nationalism.¬†
* Aims for open borders long-term.¬†

¬†

¬†

Intellectual Property Restructuring:¬†

* Patents and copyrights are abolished. Trademarks are kept in a limited capacity only. Instead IP is replaced by the¬†Intellectual Achievement Prize, where the an individual who accomplishes a task of the intellectual nature, whether that be in the sciences or literature, is given a¬†yearly state stipend¬†which scales proportional to the assessed benefit to society (sciences) as determined by the Science Directorate or creative potential (literature) as determined by the Department of Culture.¬†
* The idea is then made¬†open source public property. This approach pushes for¬†innovation¬†through more open technological access and creative expressions of existing ideas. The creator of the idea is free to attempt to pursue profits in the market through it, creators still would have¬†First Mover Advantage, but they don‚Äôt have exclusive access and everyone can use it.¬†
* However, if an idea turns out to be significantly more groundbreaking than the Science Directorate or the Department of Culture had expected, the creator is entitled to proportionally higher stipend and compensation.¬†
* This restructuring aims to combine the monetary incentives of Intellectual Property with the cumulative benefits of open source. The Soviet Union demonstrated in the past that it is possible to push the boundaries of science and technology without IP laws. This system optimises and builds upon that idea while incorporating monetary incentives.

¬†

¬†

Energy Policy:¬†

* The state will primarily rely on¬†nuclear fission¬†to generate its energy.¬†Renewable¬†sources could also be used for the sake of¬†diversification.¬†
* Fossil fuel based energy generation will be phased out rapidly through regulation, taxation and large scale nuclear and renewable construction programmes through state initiatives and public-private SOEs.¬†
* Countries like France have proven this can work. This is until¬†nuclear fusion¬†has matured into a technology that would¬†fuel the human race with the power of a star.¬†

¬†

¬†

Union Policy:

* Imperial Socialism recognises Trade Unions as an important tool to defend workers‚Äô rights. The¬†right to industrial action against private exploitation is recognised. Unions are to be coordinate with the ICS Mandate their profession falls under and be advised by officials appointed by the Mandate. The right of private employees to industrial action is viewed by the state as an additional check against corporate power.
* Unions in government institutions have the right to industrial action so far as it does not result in harm to the citizenry. Where it does, such as in medicine or public transport, limitations are placed on industrial action. Whether industrial action could potentially cause harm is assessed by a workforce-interdepartmental interface committee.¬†
* Since public sector workers are part of the department itself, they are instead encouraged to¬†make use of departmental mechanisms¬†previously outlined to put pressure on their Council Member¬†over industrial action. Their votes wield significant power and it is preferred that they use them over industrial action. Ultimately, workers in these departments are considered¬†part of the Meritocracy¬†and will always be compensated accordingly when the system works as intended.

¬†

¬†

¬†

# Societal System

Social Policy:¬†

* Imperial Socialism knows that ‚Äúwomen hold up half the sky‚Äù and thus will ensure that¬†Gender equality is prioritised, ensuring equity for women and¬†rejecting any form of misogyny, nationalism, or religiosity. Every measure¬†will be taken to bring about¬†absolute equality for women, including a 50-50 balance in the Meritocracy. Commissions, potentially including female only committees, will be set up to investigate if quotas are necessary.¬†
* Imperial Socialism¬†opposes identity politics¬†and inter-sectionalism, just as socialism of old had, viewing them as¬†an expression of regressive hyper-individualism and consumerism¬†that detracts from the universalist and collectivist ideals that shall guide our human race.¬†
* Instead, Imperial Socialism promotes universalism, and takes active steps toward it.
* Age gaps over 5 years are taxed, with the tax proportional to the gap to promote equality and raise revenue. Both the man and woman involved are taxed regardless of who is older.¬†Infidelity is a crime that results in a fine to promote fidelity and raise revenue. Fines proportional to wealth.¬†
* The state promotes an egalitarian nucelar family model akin to those of Soviet and Chinese societies, based on the concept of Societal Harmony to encourage equality, loyalty, monogamy, and stable partnerships without regressive connotations.¬†
* Deviancy and bourgeois degeneracy is taxed.¬†
* Social Media and Nightclubs¬†are¬†pressured into passing the cost onto customers through¬†heavy taxes. Tax funded projects initiate¬†large scale construction of public amenities¬†and socialising programs to encourage interaction in person. This would include things like festivals, social centres, state owned cafes which¬†facilitate meeting new people,¬†social amenities, et alia. Event organisers will make it easy to meet new people.¬†
* This measure aims to repair the fragmentation of society and over-reliance on corporate social media which was built off of algorithmic practices that encouraged addiction.¬†

¬†¬†

¬†

Justice¬†Restructuring:¬†

* The issues of prison¬†overcrowding, spiralling spending, and recidivism¬†are tackled.¬†
* Jail is¬†reserved for heinous crimes¬†like murder, rape, paedophillia, sex trafficking, treason, et alia, as the existing system is costly, traumatising, dehumanising, and promotes recidivism rather than rehabilitation.
* ¬†Minor offences are addressed through¬†wealth-proportional fines.
* ¬†White-collar crime¬†incurs¬†catastrophic penalties, including, at the¬†most severe level, complete asset confiscation and ruinous fines. Such severity is¬†necessitated¬†by this type of crime¬†damaging trust¬†in systems that allow for stability and prosperity, as well as reducing¬†market efficiency.¬†
* The hyper-rich are prevented from hiding their wealth by having them register all assets at all times (common practice currently) and additionally, the¬†onus is on them to pay the fine, which at the highest level could equal most of their net worth, by whatever means necessary.¬†Failing to do so by hiding wealth results in being sentenced to the VLC.¬†
* An individual can also join the¬†Voluntary Labour Corps (VLC)¬†instead of paying the fine or if an individual cannot pay the fine, where offenders¬†pay off their debt¬†to society by contributing their manual labour. It allows¬†rehabilitation¬†through state infrastructure work while allowing individuals to¬†return home¬†daily and¬†maintain their dignity.¬†A key factor is to avoid isolating and alienating the minor offender from society.¬†
* The VLC offers pay, a stable job, discipline and a commendation that can be put on the former minor offender‚Äôs¬†CV. Having served there is not stigmatised but a mark of having done public service and demonstrated discipline, teamwork, organisation and hard work.¬†
* Simultaneously, this system greatly¬†reduces the load on state finances¬†for holding these minor offenders in jail, provides a cost efficient labour force and reforms more individuals than a prison would have.¬†
* This need not be an excessively long sentence, even just a few days to a few weeks at the lowest levels, to years, scaling with crime.¬†
* Major offenders guilty of heinous crimes such as rape, murder, paedophilia, treason to the species, et alia, serve in the VLC permanently, and are considered to be the¬†Damned. They work in harsher conditions without pay, living in prison camps and contributing to demanding projects without parole, acting as a punishment, deterrent and utility. They are overseen by armed commissars to ensure compliance.¬†
* Wrongful convictions result in massive compensation, incentivising judicial accuracy.

Oldest Vices Policy:

* Imperial Socialism acknowledges that the three vices of drugs, gambling and prostitution are as¬†old as human history¬†and cannot easily be wiped out. However, they can be¬†brought to heel¬†and managed for the common good.¬†
* Private establishments have to undergo constant and rigorous tests. Any evidence of abuse, whether of workers or otherwise, results in harsh crackdowns.¬†
* Prostitution is heavily taxed to generate revenue. It is expected that infidelity fines will also generate strong revenue from this sector, unfortunately but not without its utility.
* Gambling is also legalised but¬†heavily taxed to generate revenue.¬†
* Exploitative or addictive practices result in closure of the gambling site, seizure of all assets and heavy fines for all involved. Science Directorate mathematicians will be routinely inspect the probabilities involved behind each gambling mechanism to check for fairness, among other security checks.¬†
* Both prostitution and gambling will be heavily regulated by the state and under constant oversight by the Mandate of the Interior (Mandate of the ICS) as well as the Judiciary.¬†
* The Science Directorate will assess each drug and determine whether or not it constitutes a significant health risk, in both the long and short terms.¬†
* The drugs determined to be within manageable parameters are legalised and strictly controlled through a regulated system managed by the ICS where access is limited in accordance with health risks and prices are fair while allowing profit to the state to fund other activities.¬†
* This policy ensures that those that seek drugs will only receive them under controlled, medically approved conditions as well as safe substances.¬†
* Harsh and overwhelming crackdown against illegal substances and all who distribute and consume them. Participating in the illegal drug trade results in an automatic sentencing to the VLC for a significant period.

¬†

¬†

Media Policy:

* Freedom of speech is a fundamental right¬†that will be defended by the Meritocracy, in so far as it does not damage the public good.¬†
* Harming the public good is defined as inciting violence or promoting extremist ideologies (hyper-nationalism, religious zealotry, sexism are template examples). The exact definitions will be laid out by the¬†Judiciary. Such a caveat is common practice in mature systems such as Canada and Germany.¬†
* Principled¬†opposition, whether public or personal, to and criticism of Meritocracy policy is¬†protected by the state.
* Private media can operate freely, however adherence to factual information is legally binding, failure to do so results in severe fines. Outright lies and¬†misinformation will be harshly penalised.¬†Fines proportional to company size.¬†
* Private ownership over media is regulated for the common good.¬†No one person is to dominate entire outlets¬†with the goal of manipulating public sentiment as we have observed with the Murdoch Empire. The amount of stake an individual can hold in a new corporation after it passes a certain size is limited, encouraged a wide range of investors to be shareholders. This¬†combats monopolisation¬†and domination of corporate structures that could hinder the¬†free market.¬†
* The state will run¬†two media outlets, one that is¬†favourable¬†to the Meritocracy‚Äôs policies and one that is¬†critical. Both will always receive equal funding and regularly host debates between senators, civil officials, activists, independent experts et alia.
* Experts of course, even in The Meritocracy, would rarely have consensus on policy. The Meritocracy would generally follow the directive of the Imperial Council, but there will be swathes of experts who disagree. They will be given a voice through this critical media outlet.¬†
* Free access to the internet¬†is enshrined in the law. Only websites that are judged to be breaking the law by the Judiciary can be blocked.

¬†

¬†

Floor Provision Policy:¬†

Basic necessities, including education, internet, housing, utilities, and healthcare, are to be provided¬†universally¬†in the medium-term, funded by taxes to¬†encourage spending¬†on more sophisticated activities that better drive the economy economy better such as¬†hobbies, fine dining, technology,¬†et alia.¬†

Nomenclature:

Imperial Socialism has a broad scope, redefining society and ideology itself, therefore its nomenclature must reflect that. A key goal is to redirect the loyalty of the populace from current tribalistic fault lines, ie religion, nationalism, populism, et alia, towards the system built here and allow them to place their trust in it for their well being. This requires a certain level of grandiosity to inspire faith and a sense of awe. An idea that the system¬†will¬†work and it will work for them. Hence why the names chosen must be as they are. A secretary is someone who the population identifies as one that fetches their coffee and writes the minutes. But a mandarin is a scholar-bureaucrat who can truly govern.¬†

Similarly, a committee conjures images of red tape and bureaucratic clog, while the Meritocracy, or the Imperial Council, or the Mandates of the Civil Service, are monolithic institutions of unassailable authority. However, this grandiosity has to be, and is, tempered with the knowledge that each of these systems operates according to stringent checks and balances, and that anyone with the merit can and will rise in them.¬†

¬†

Iconography:

The¬†Meritocracy Iconography¬†features a black background with a double headed golden eagle, holding a red hammer and sickle, with glowing red eyes, and a red UN symbol surrounded by red laurel wreathes, embodying the Meritocracy‚Äôs ideals.

¬†

# Objective:¬†

At the core of Imperial Socialism is the acknowledgement of a fundamental truth that is as incontrovertible as it is immutable: the **Oneness of the Human Race**. Humankind is one species by any valid definition, may that be scientific, historical, material, anthropological, or philosophical. Yet, for aeons we have been divided by creeds that benefit from ceaseless strife, bound by the chains of borders, superstitions, and demagogues.

Our species faces a choice. We can continue to fester in the bile of tribalism, fight, kill, main, murder, persecute, and slaughter our own kind until we face our inevitable extinction. A blip in the history of the cosmos. Glorified apes that wasted our potential.¬†

Or we can transcend these divisions, and work towards unification. To reach for the stars, to fulfil what we as a species excel at. Expand, learn, adapt. To leave the confines of our Motherland and seize our destiny.

Imperial Socialism will eradicate all divisive identities‚Äînational, racial, or religious‚Äîto achieve a cohesive, universal human identity: Terran. The erasure of old identities is a policy to be pursued subtly and slowly but inexorably, to dismantle them over time through housing ethnic quotas, tax policy, school quotas, interracial marriages, state atheism, cultural directives, education campaigns, et alia.¬†

Imperial Socialism will shatter the shackles that have bound our kind, our bodies and our minds. It will take time, and it will not be easy, nor would it be immediately utopian. But it will also be necessary if our species is to have a future worthy of the term.

I was diagnosed with an eating disorder at 18, I'm now 35. Over the years I've been in and out of inpatient and outpatient e.d clinics. Many of my friends are aware of this and this person in particular has seen me at my worse (very slim and fainting due to anaemia/hyponotrenia). She knows I hate weight/diet culture and any discussions about it and how critical i am of fat-phobia. However she's very competitive in nature, e.g decided to start trying for a baby 2 days after I told her I was pregnant (even though the plan was for her and her partner to marry first but that got changed straight away). And most recently I informed her we were house-hunting before wanting a second kid. Fast forward 4 weeks and she messages asking to go for coffee and boom she's bought a new house. Anyway, I've been on mounjaro for a few months with a huge reduction in my binge/purge episodes. Low and behold she messages me wanting to go for coffee, me being suspicious starts looking at her social media etc and low and behold she's on mounjaro and lost weight. She obviously wants me to see this as some of her posts have been about people not noticing her losses. But like, she knows that'll be triggering for me and I hate speaking about weight loss. Is there anyway I can just avoid seeing her?

**HIGHLIGHTS**

* [Jesus you people are evil](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1h7tgsg/a_sketch_of_the_uhc_assassin_being_carried_with/m0o308l/)

   * The health insurance industry in the USA is one of, if not the, most evil industries in the country. Everyone despises these people apart from the worst boot lickers.

      * I am not denying the fact that healthcare companies are not evil but also stating the fact that r/pics and its users like you ARE ALSO EVIL

         * Why? When something bad happens to evil people, is it evil to celebrate it?

   * The man shot was arguably responsible for tens of thousands of deaths, and would have gone on to be responsible for thousands more.

      * His death does not prevent any future deaths or denial of coverage so... it didnt do anything good or different than whats been going on before he died.

         * If Hitler ran off instead of killing himself at the end of WW2, would he still deserve death?

             * I know you aren't comparing Hitler to some guy who is a CEO. hate to tell you but that's a job that is probably already filled and world keeps turning. 

    * Yeah imagine killing hundreds of thousands of people and thinking you can walk around with no consequences, the assassin is a hero

      * The only thing that assassin did was deprive a woman and children of her husband and father. He may have done bad things but killing him doesn't help anyone.

         * You mean his estranged wife. Even she didn't like the guy.

             * His children are still fatherless.

      * I dare you to say this stupid shit in front of actual people. You people need to get off the Internet.

       * That‚Äôs the thinking of an idiot.

          * ^^^ found another of those ""pro-CEO"" types

              * I‚Äôm more anti-murder than I am pro-CEO. But Reddit loves making heroes out of losers, so guess I‚Äôm in the minority

   * But murdering people by lying through your teeth to deny access to healthcare, like that dead monster did is okay? That monster is burning in hell and. I hope there's an after life and he spends eternity reliving massive pain he inflicted on millions.

        * Celebrating murder on either side is evil. Even Nazis had trials for their crimes.

             * Just curious, do you consider the French Resistance evil? They certainly killed nazis without trials

                   * Because an occupying army is comparable to an insurance ceo

                   * Are you seriously conflating Nazi‚Äôs and the violent murder of millions of people to a heath care executive? Holy shit that might be the most reddit brain thing I have ever read on here.  It‚Äôs also super disrespectful to the victims of Nazi Germany when you trivialize what went through turning it into an argument for your own pet social cause.

             * The reality is that in the current political system, none of these people will face justi

                   * Because they've done nothing illegal

* [The people commenting and posting all this shit are demented.](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1h7tgsg/a_sketch_of_the_uhc_assassin_being_carried_with/m0o12eu/) 

   * Absolutely true.  Celebrating a cold blooded murder is just beyond fucked up, especially because people somehow think they have a moral highground here.

       * All the people celebrating lost their minds when George Floyd was murdered, Kyle Rittenhouse killing a convicted pedophile in self defense etc.  This clearly has nothing to do with moral high ground or consequences. It all boils down to ""Murdering people I don't like = good"". 

          * ""It all boils down to ""Murdering people I don't like objectively evil people = good"".""  I celebrated when Osama Bin Laden died, and objectively speaking, Brian Thompson caused WAY more suffering and deaths for Americans than Osama Bin Laden ever did.

               * Skipping that first sentence huh.

      * He was evil how exactly? Managing a company in a broken system or because he got wealthy in a high value Job?  Maybe we start shooting doctors who got rich in the health care system too.

         * You do realize UHC had DOUBLE the industry standard for denials, right? It wasn't by a small margin. They are the industry leader in inflicting suffering on their customers.

         *  But doctors help people. Doctors make half a million to save lives. This guy made tens of millions from denying care at double the industry average rate. They are NOT the same.

              * So is it because the guy was rich or was it what he did according to your feels?  
Choose one to justify his cold blooded murder while thinking you are morally correct.

      * Why?

          * Because murdering people is wrong?  Following a moral framework where this murder is fine, consequently is for death penalties and also against the justice system generally.  So if a cop thinks some guy did something bad, he should just murder him, because why the fuck not, right?

               * But this ceo was doing nothing wrong in a legal sense

* [Sure the CEO was horrible  But Killing him and acting like the assassin is the hero? the only way to make change is by creating protests (peaceful ones like blocking major transportation for the said company* or y'know, just wait until every company gets hit hard the recession that's gonna happen in a few years](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1h7tgsg/a_sketch_of_the_uhc_assassin_being_carried_with/m0o9k5l/)

   * The only way to address healthcare is to peacefully protest??? Or to wait for the company to lower its cost by itself??? Do you hear yourself?

       * Second part is dumb, first one isn't. Do you remember Martin Luther King? Did they shoot anyone? No. But did they still accomplish a lot? Yes, absolutely. Protests are an essential part of any democracy and one of the major ways things change. Murder isn't. He's just going to be replaced, the company doesn't care about him either. So start protesting.

             * Hahahah if you think the US of the 60s is the US we have today then you‚Äôve gotta do some reflecting

   * The man shot was arguably responsible for tens of thousands of deaths, and would have gone on to be responsible for thousands more.  You think that thousands of deaths would not bother him, but people asking him nicely would?

       * How does murdering him fix the problem either way?

           * It sends a message that their actions have consequences.

               * No it doesn't. If anything it shows they need to beef security up. Are we just going to kill anyone who we see as bad now?

         * I never said it fixed the problem, but I have no sympathy for him. You can‚Äôt just kill thousands, then say ‚Äúkilling me won‚Äôt stop the killing‚Äù, and expect all to be forgiven.  If nothing else, it‚Äôs a deterrent to whoever takes his place

               * The only thing it did was tell the next dude to beef security up. Murdering him didn't fix the Healthcare system in any way.

* [Ok - Reddit is completely fucked in the head. This is so wild](https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1h7tgsg/a_sketch_of_the_uhc_assassin_being_carried_with/m0o5kxy/)

   * This is one of the worst circlejerks I‚Äôve seen in a long time here, and that‚Äôs saying something 

       * One of the cringiest as well. Everyone sounding like a bunch of 14 year old edgelords up in here. I think Trump winning caused the average Redditor to have a full on mental break and this is one of the many ways it is manifesting itself. 

           * Exactly. They lost and now just want to tear everything down. Burn it all down. Like a toddler who destroys others structures during free time when they don‚Äôt get their way. It‚Äôs manifesting in them larping as revolutionary class warriors who have somehow ‚Äúsent a message‚Äù. It‚Äôs so cringe

                 * Hey dipshit maybe go check out r/conservative because it isn't just one side rooting this on.

   * It's not Reddit. This is what happens when you oppress a working class. Just look at the late 1800s and early 1900s.

      * No its reddit. no sane person would be glorifying this as much

           * https://np.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/s/oyK4cZ984  What would make you think it's just reddit doing this?

                   * Ok let change it to social media, better?

       * ‚ÄúOppress the working class‚Äù you know there a literal slaves mining cobalt for your phones battery so you can write stupid shit like this? Take your oppression and go make a cup of coffee Susan.

            * The ""yet you participate in society"" doesn't make people less mad dawg

                 * We should probably do something about the slavery before we move on to the fact that your mom didn‚Äôt get the right kind of chips at the store or whatever your precieved ‚Äúoppression‚Äù is this week

         * Same working class that was so oppressed they chose Donald Trump, one of the biggest pro big business candidates in recent years?

               * Unironically yes. Despite his actual policies he's managed to paint himself as the working man's anti-establishment candidate.

           * I can guarantee you, most members of the ""working class"" (hint: it's not the people writing tumblr poetry for the cause) are on Reddit. Y'all are LARPing.

                   * Why are poetry and the working class mutually exclusive?

* [This is an artist taking an advantage of a moment to become famous (hopefully for them). Let us not confuse this with a mandate on what is right vs. wrong. Murder is wrong. ](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1h7tgsg/a_sketch_of_the_uhc_assassin_being_carried_with/m0nwvld/)

   * Yes especially murdering people by denying them Life-Saving treatments just to help your annual bonus.

      * The way you think is so original. 

          * why is his way of thinking wrong? What other way of thinking is there? The guy had his hand in alot of peoples deaths and could of changed that but didnt.

               * And how do you know that? Were you in the board meeting while they were making decisions? The board can still overturn the CEO in decisions, blindly thinking that the CEO had a hand in the thousands of cases that come in everyday is this idiotic and anyone cheering on murder is evil which is not surprising since this is a leftist subreddit that spouts eat the rich.

   * What about the healthcare CEO responsible for millions of people being denied care and potentially dying as a result?

        * What about confusing your desire for a scapegoat with justice?

             * How is it so hard to understand why seeing a CEO of a company responsible for the suffering of millions of people getting murked is an extremely cathartic moment for so many people? I'm under no illusions that this is going to fix anything but it's hard to deny that it's the closest thing to justice a lot of people are ever going to feel.

                   * I hate to break it to you, but in this type of situation feelings are often wrong. And tragically, the catharsis will correct nothing as you admit. So why condone something we all know is wrong - murder. 

* [This shits weird.  The way this guy is being revered is going to lead to more killing ‚Äî and, spoiler, it‚Äôs not always going to be a target you agree with.](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1h7tgsg/a_sketch_of_the_uhc_assassin_being_carried_with/m0o1osa/)

   * It's already not, though. Definitely prefer this over babies in pre k.

       * Yeah let‚Äôs direct mass shooters to insurance conferences rather than schools!

       * There were young kids shot in California literally today. This does nothing to curb gun violence in schools ‚Äî if anything it will probably worsen that too. The kid shooting up his school can see himself as a hero just as easily. ‚ÄúI was standing up to X, I‚Äôm a hero‚Äù. We might not agree with that one, but the kid contemplating murder isn‚Äôt going to poll the general public first.  asdfgIt‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs a finite amount of gun violence and it‚Äôs being redirected elsewhere. It‚Äôs just increasing.

            * So what‚Äôs your plan chief, this has already worked to get a different insurance company to revoke a dangerous policy that might have killed thousands.  Show me some results that other shit works.

            * Things gotta get worse before they get better. Maybe we'll get better mental healthcare and gun control if people that ""actually matter"" are the targets rather than some random kid.

            * Wtf are you talking about. This discussion has nada to do with the prevalence of school shootings. The two situations are so far apart both motivation-wise and pragmatically as to render any argument predicated upon their supposed similarity at best a laughable one. And how does the last sentence relate at all to the subject matter, precisely? Pathetic. Three non-sequiturs in a trenchcoat larping as an argument.


      * That's a false dichotomy. We have the power to get all American citizens access to healthcare peacefully by voting for politicians who campaign strongly for universal healthcare. We did not do that though. Murder isn't the answer. Voting for the people who will pass universal healthcare is the answer.  It's so frustrating that people are not voting in their own best interest and then getting so mad at the downward spiral that they feel murder is justified. None of this would be necessary if we simply voted in the healthcare system that the rest of the world uses. We need healthcare reform.

          * When are the people who will pass universal healthcare going to be on the ballot?

                 * If Bernie Sanders had been elected, this may have never happened and we might have single payer healthcare. But I don't believe we live in that kind of a democracy. The corporations, and the wealthiest 1% didn't want that. They didn't want him. They gave us another corporate owned Democrat to vote for. The pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies, large Wall Street banks, etc. control both parties.

                 * When you put some work in getting them through primaries and on to the ballot? Did you not learn about this in high school civics class? Do you think people magically appear on ballots?

          * Propaganda won't allow this.

               * You had best hope that it doesn't become the case that people who don't get their way through legal methods begin murdering anyone who disagrees with them. What happens when someone disagrees with you?

  * I know right? All my friends and family who make vile and unethical decisions to profit off of the most vulnerable people better watch out!

     * This is the thing with slippery slope, right now it's billionaire fucks, but the bar keeps getting lower. Mobs are dumb.

         * People are starting to feel more and more powerless to change things, that historically usually leads to a more violent population, if peoples lives continue to get worse this will become far more common.

             * Yes, but that violence won't always be directed at people you oppose. Sometimes this will be against people you support, god forbid, someone you actually care about.

      * People with different political leanings might think you and your friends are the bad guys. But please keep glorifying murder

           * People with different political leanings are ALREADY doing that. This won't change that factor. All it does do is show that the Billionaire class isn't untouchable.

               * Except the man wasn‚Äôt even remotely close to being a billionaire so, again, fuck all achieved.

           * We are glorifying justice. If the legal system won‚Äôt give us justice, is it any surprise that people will celebrate it where they can get it? 

                  * the middle east is a bastion of peace ever since they started cutting thieves' hands off.  As the saying goes, an eye for an eye makes the world perfect.

   * [Why is it weird? Don't most people approve of the death penalty? Aren't people in the military considered heroes in the US? Why is this different?](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1h7tgsg/a_sketch_of_the_uhc_assassin_being_carried_with/m0ofjq9/)

      * Most people approve of due process too

          * Due process only works if you can‚Äôt buy the laws. If the people involved are above the law, due process isn‚Äôt an option anymore.

             * What laws did this CEO break?

              * *(ctnd)* That‚Äôs the entire point, genius. He can just buy the laws. The laws are written for people like him to be allowed to do it. Now, if we go by natural law, he‚Äôs a predatory mass murdering scumbag with a higher body count than 99.9% of humanity. We‚Äôre just rediscovering natural law because the legalism has failed.

   * Exactly. I‚Äôm gonna get downvoted, but this is out of control. I totally get that insurance companies are bullshit and scams (not just health, all insurance), but to be praising someone for cold blooded murder? You‚Äôre right. Idiots are going to think it‚Äôs okay, and replicate. Very troubling times.

       * when they understand that this is the alternative to simply more progressive policies... i dunno, i think thats honestly the best civic engagement america has seen in years  i dont know if you actually ""get"" how bloodthirsty insurance is... you have likely not had a loved one unnecessarily DIE while living in the richest country in history... rich people deserve to worry about their mortality again. they sure aint worried about ours

       * They literally see us as cattle and you feel bad? 95% of CEOs are demon incarnates. If people who are stressed enough to kill start targeting CEOs instead of schools and places of worship after seeing all this support then id call it a true win-win situation

          * [Dude it‚Äôs not going to stop school shootings and just become open season for anyone people disagree with.](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1h7tgsg/a_sketch_of_the_uhc_assassin_being_carried_with/m0o5yc0/)

             * Yep you‚Äôre right, im gonna go kill my neighbor for parking in my spot after seeing this. Delusional üòÇ

                * *(ctnd)* Yes you are delusional. Glad you can accept that.  It clear you‚Äôre very immature and don‚Äôt understand the ramifications of this but just want to attack people.
          
           * [One day you will stop being 17](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1h7tgsg/a_sketch_of_the_uhc_assassin_being_carried_with/m0o4r4o/)

                 * One day you‚Äôll stop being literally so out of touch that the average person could find more in common with a homeless drug addict than you. Why do you care about a billionaire who became rich off of the suffering of literal millions of people? Regard.

* [I think things like what this guy did should happen more often. Just my opinion](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1h7tgsg/a_sketch_of_the_uhc_assassin_being_carried_with/m0o61da/)

   * You think more rich people should be killed in cold blood for being rich?

       * You think the main reason he was killed was because he was rich? Silly goose.

           * I never said that was the main reason so I‚Äôm not sure where you got that from 
 Someone who indirectly is causing harm shouldn‚Äôt have the masses happy they were murdered in cold blood

               * Is it indirectly if he‚Äôs fully aware of it? Are you saying he had no power over the system he was a part of? Who directly caused harm then? The folks working below him? Where does the blame lie when someone‚Äôs life-saving treatment is denied? Why do YOU care so much? Ask yourself why the masses ARE happy, it‚Äôs probably for a reason. No need to defend a dead man who certainly would not give a shit about your life were the roles reversed. He made MONEY off of a callous disregard for human welfare.  Edit: It was implied you believed it to be the main reason when you said ‚Äúfor being rich‚Äù, by the way. If you didn‚Äôt mean it to come across that way you should say what you actually mean.

       * This is disingenuous to say the least lmfao

            * I‚Äôm the disingenuous one for asking for clarity when someone is suggesting more people should be murdered because we don‚Äôt agree with their polices

                * Describing a guy who would watch your house be repossessed because you couldn't afford cancer treatment if it raised his stock position 5% as ""someone who disagreed with policies"" is wild lmao.

* [It's offputting that Americans celebrate a murderer.](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1h7tgsg/a_sketch_of_the_uhc_assassin_being_carried_with/m0optcg/)

   * ‚Ä¶ did you see who was elected? Are you surprised?  Also, do you know ANYTHING about the company that guy was CEO of?

      * It's completely irrelevant what company this guy was CEO of and if they were evil or not. Killing a person is never good.

         * Something needs to die every time something eats. Humans like to think we are special, but sometimes removing evil with surgical precision is a necessity for society. Progress is built on blood, and the foundation for revolution is bone.

             * What an archaic view on life. I am glad I don't see the world that grim.",26,1733528424.0,SubredditDrama,42,1.0,False

1h8f2u7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1h8f2u7/99_sure_my_marriage_is_over_and_have_no_been/,99% sure my marriage is over and have no been given any real reason why,"Super long story, Together 17 years , married 12. She has a chronic illness that I supported over the past 11 years where she was unable to work. I provided for everything, including paying down her student loans. We certainly became roomates, sex was 3-5 time a year at best. Mostly because she was always nauseous or having other symptoms from her condition. We had no children together, I had 2 from a previous marriage. She was a fantastic step mom. What really changed the game was she got on some meds that improved her condition she asked to go on a trip to CA by herself as she felt human again and wanted to visit some friends etc. While there she went to a Tarot card reader. She had brought this up in the past, and she knows I think all of those things are pseudo-science and not to be taken seriously. When she returned home she found a place locally that does Tarot, Reiki, crystals and other energy work. She really threw herself into this, she would go to this place several times a week for hours at a time. Bought so many raw rocks, and crystals, oils, Tarot decks etc. I certainly let me her know my thoughts on that stuff. It went really over the top when she had made a shrine in the kitchen with it. 

 She is a medical professional in the psychology space. We had our daughter and gf living with us, and the gf had been sexually abused as a child and has some severe trauma from this. My wife though it would help to take her to a Reiki Master, leave her in a room alone with him so he could ""heal her""

When I found out about this, I lost my shit. Re-traumatizing this poor girl was mind blowing to me. Especially from someone trained at a PhD level in this. We tried therapy, she went to a few sessions and still wanted a divorce. We spoke about how we could ""date"" each other and I encouraged her to get a job since she was seemingly healthy enough to go to Reiki classes 3-4 times a week. We would still text and chat on the phone, especially as she would be frustrated with her new job and wanted advice. She basically wanted the benefits of being married without having to live together and be married.  

I had already split the bank account in half, gave her half my stock from work. Paying her student loans, car payment. The agreement was until the end of the year then we evaluate where we are and go from there. 

Today i finally had enough and wrote her an email communicating how she needs to make a decision about what she wants. Because we haven't ""dated"" during all of this. People have told me over and over how nice and compassionate I have been. She has also told me this. But I feel used, like I am a sucker. I have given so much to this woman, stood by her though 100's of doctor appointments etc. I also had some mirror health issues the week before she left and I sure wish the favor would have been returned. I am 47, have a great career , have a great relationship with my 2 children. I have stopped going to the therapist we saw together and am currently seeking another one. I have gone on some of the dating apps, went on a few coffee dates and realized I am just not in the right place for any of that. I've been told how great of a provider I am, I was never abusive of any sort. Don't drink , don't smoke and was comfortable letting her spend money and time on things I didn't always agree with but never would stand in her way. 

I dunno what I am looking for by posting, I work from home in the home we shared. Its been incredibly difficult at times. I am so much more emotional than I ever have been in my life. Could I have been more attentive and loving? for sure. I definitely would find hobbies and things to do because she was constantly sick and sleeping. The only real answer she gave me was she is doing this for her, to find herself and to be happy. She said it's not my fault its something she needed to do. I do not believe she is seeing anyone, she works a crazy amount of hours and her physical condition makes it where she wont have much energy even if she had the time. I guess I just struggle why someone would blow up a good life. The more women I have chatted with about thier experiences dating and the men they find just makes me sit here and ask ""whats wrong with me?""  I am heartbroken and I am trying my best to keep it together but its been so incredibly difficult. 

I guess if anyone has been though something similar , i'd love to hear about it or just giving me some hope to get on the other side of this.

1h8ey1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h8ey1j/crush_broke_me_downam_i_the_ahole/,Crush broke me down/am I the a-hole ,"Hey everyone, I experienced something not so nice some time ago and wanted to share it hoping it might help others not feel alone in it and feel guilty like I do, so here is what happened‚Ä¶

I started on an education I was really excited and passionate about, it was going well at first but then I met this guy I‚Äôll call him Tyler (not his real name), he was on my class and I thought he looked really cute and attractive, he showed me trust and that I could trust him too very early on before we even really knew each other. So I told a girl in my school I thought Tyler was pretty cute, she didn‚Äôt quite understand it but non the less supported me for telling her about it. A few days later some classmates and I was out to get a drink together to get to know each other and this was the first time I really talked properly with Tyler, we ended up talking about a lot of personal and heavy things like grief and loosing loved ones, as the hours went on I started liking Tyler more and more. As the weeks went on after the get together I realized I had gotten a crush on Tyler and I quickly realized I was not his type so without thinking much about it I changed myself a little like my laugh was never a full on laugh, my style got more feminine and cute than it usually was. One day I told him I liked him, I didn‚Äôt mean to tell him and especially not the way I did but I was drunk and non the less told him straight up right that I liked him. He rejected me saying we didn‚Äôt know each other well enough and we had to be professional. I was upset ofc but I understood and accepted it at that, later that evening I was talking with a woman from the other class about the situation and she took me under her wing immediately comforting me and telling me I‚Äôm better off without him anyways since I deserved someone who liked me back just as much if not more. Then Tyler rejected me again but even more half hearted then the first time making me confused and a bit irritated since I‚Äôm not dumb I understood it the first time. Then later after walking around (Tyler was with the group too) he rejected me again, I was already hurt from being rejected but he kept rubbing it in like salt in a wound, we all went to a place to get some food, we talked for a while and I was trying my hardest to act okay because Tyler was right there next to me.  Then we went to a bar and got even more drinks, the girl from earlier and I got really close and became friends. (Rest of the night not that important)

A while went by after that evening/night and things between us got awkward but I tried to talk it out with Tyler to not much use. He was acting weird and distant unlike his usual self and it made me anxious. After it affecting me too much in class (Tyler and I was in the same class) one of the teachers noticed and pulled me aside to ask what was wrong, I told them everything and they called for a meeting between the three of us (teacher, Tyler and me) we talked it out properly this time with the teachers help. Then things got better for a little bit, Tyler and I kept a distance to each other for a while until one day when I felt like I was finally over him he became very friendly, he would come up and talk to me a lot, always stand near me, ask for me when I wasn‚Äôt in class and asking if he can help me with something. I was a bit surprised and confused at his sudden change in behavior but didn‚Äôt mind to much, even letting him help me with things in class. This went on for awhile but then he started ignoring me again for some reason, and then being overly friendly again the next day and sometimes it felt like he was flirting with me (and the friends I talked to about it agreed) I was so confused because he rejected me, became weird, then ignored me like I was invisible, then super friendly, then ignored me like I was invisible again and then flirty and friendly. All the emotions from earlier came back but much stronger this time. The way he changed between making me feel invisible and worthless to making me feel like the most important person and then changing back and forth between the two many many times. I became really depressed and anxious, I started thinking maybe I‚Äôm not worth it, maybe I‚Äôm not smart enough, pretty enough, skinny enough, maybe i‚Äôm too weird and annoying. It kept spiraling for a few weeks before I one day overheard him say to one of his friends ‚Äúshe is so annoying‚Äù. It broke me completely because I was positive he was talking about me. My depression got worse and I started eating way less than before, feeling sick by just the thought of eating cause I felt gross and unattractive. I felt like giving up on life because nothing felt worth it, I kept adjusting my personality to fit what made him feel comfortable. I also kept trying to be friendly and actually wanted to be just friends with him, I support him in whatever he does, compliments him, stand up for him when the others tease him a little to much, check up on him to make sure he is okay and try to help him calm down when he is stressed. I try to cheer him up when is upset or having a bad day even if I‚Äôm having a bad day too. I always put him first even though he cause me so much pain. I can‚Äôt really eat or sleep because of him, I live off coffee and energy drinks pretty much. Reasonly i said something while drunk and it didn‚Äôt get understood the way I meant it to. I felt so guilty and horrible for making him uncomfortable even though he hurt me so much. I tried talking the whole situation out with him but he wasn‚Äôt interested. I ended up texting him and apologizing for everything and he accepted the apology which I‚Äôm grateful for but idk if I should tell him how he hurt me, I don‚Äôt want to make him uncomfortable but he hurts me so much changing between Im invisible to him and like we are friends. I care deeply about him and want to be friends with him. I‚Äôd even take a bullet for him if needed because that‚Äôs how much he means to me.

1h8evwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nobuy/comments/1h8evwd/anyone_experiencing_money_anxiety/,Anyone experiencing money anxiety?,"Hi All,

Please bear with me for posting often on this group as I am new to this. I have been having so much anxiety this month. 

I used to be a great saver. In fact, I saved up enough money over the past four years to cash flow my master‚Äôs program. The problem was that I was also making a lot of money, and so I wasn‚Äôt very strict with my spending. I am now in my final year as a master‚Äôs student, making a small student salary, and I am practically in the negatives (I have more in credit card charges right now than I do in my bank account). I never had debt in my life, and now I can‚Äôt pay off my credit card until I get my next salary. I cannot work more or change jobs until I graduate, so I need to change my habits. 

I audited some of my spending this year, and here are some categories I calculated (rounded up):
1. Clothes: $1,573
2. Ubers: $1,910
3. Gifts: $2,518
4. Groceries: $4,191
5. Dining out/in/coffees/drinks: $8,002

I am shocked by these amounts, especially seeing that I have no money left this year. I feel committed to the No Buy Year in 2025, and I am starting to adopt some habits now (if I wait until Jan 1st, I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll lose steam). I feel so uncertain and anxious right now, but here are some habits I am trying to create:

1. Creating a menu for the week. I usually grocery shop just by grabbing what I want in the store. This time I am creating a weekly menu and sticking to it. 
2. I am categorizing my clothes on the Stylebook app and will try to sell what I don‚Äôt wear.

As mentioned in the title, I am looking for an all around grinder since I enjoy multiple brewing methods. For starters, I am in the U.S., my budget is $300-$550, and I am a barista at a specialty coffee shop so I would say I have a decent amount of experience/knowledge. The brewing methods I enjoy are pour over, drip, espresso, and aeropress. However, let it be noted that I recently sold my breville barista express for the purpose of getting a solid grinder before eventually down the road buying/upgrading to the espresso machine I want. I really enjoy drinking pour overs and drip. When I have an espresso machine, I enjoy drinking espresso shots, americanos, and occasionally I will make a latte for my partner. I tend to gravitate towards light/medium roasted beans that are fruity and bright. I know that grinders typically thrive in one brewing method and tend to fall short in others, however i'm really trying here. I had my eye on the niche zero for a while, but after doing some research, I am not too sure on how I feel about it now. In addition, I do enjoy flat burrs a bit more. The grinders that I am currently considering are the timecore 064s and DF64 gen 2. I am open to other recommendations or opinions.

I'm so wired rn LMAO okay so: pretty self explanatory question but some background. I, my whole life, have NEVER ever felt anything from coffee or caffeine. Myself and my whole family are the type of people who can drink a pot of coffee and go right to sleep. In fact my parents would sometimes give my brother and I coffee as children to make us sleep LOL.

  
However, as soon as I started Vyvanse a few months ago, I felt AWFUL - horrible crashes all day, moody, anxious, etc. I realized after talking to my psychiatrist it was the caffeine. Now, I only drink caffeine on the rare day I take a day off from my meds otherwise pretty much never.

  
About a week ago I got a case of Dr Pepper Zero Cherry from Target without thinking about the caffeine and decided to try it anyways and honestly every single day it was perfectly fine. Like a couple cans a day (mixed with water ofc) was no biggie I was perfectly fine.

  
So that emboldened me to today deciding to get a medium iced coffee from dunkin and HOLY SHIT. wrong idea. bad idea. I had the coffee at 10AM, it's currently 6:30PM and i'm still WIRED.

1h8esof,https://www.reddit.com/r/Socionics/comments/1h8esof/type_me/,type me!,"hi. all opinions are welcome.

[time]

I like to ignore what's happening around me, like knowing what date today is not really important to me. you won't believe me but the calendar on my room is still in March-April 2023 (today is December 2024).

[will]

i don't have much will. my will depends on my environment whether they uplift me or not. I give up pretty easily. I'm having a hard time uplifting myself so I tend to look for external validation.

[emotions]

I'm very articulate in expressing my emotions especially when I'm angry. I know my emotions well and I can clearly see if someone is emotionally manipulating me. 

people told me I'm the most logical person they've known but I kinda don't agree because I can't hold back my emotions. I let my emotions lead me because I believe saying what you really feel is the right to do. If I get too embarrassed to say what I want to say, I'll become passive-aggressive. 

sometimes, I can turn off my emotions and not to feel anything about a person. I can be a total insensitive asshole, I do it unknowingly. but I'm trying to be understanding i swear.

[other people]

I'm a quiet person. if I got comfortable in someone's personality, I'll get bubbly and joke a lot. but if I feel like we'll gonna get close to the point that you'll get to see me vulnerable, I'll distance myself. I can contact a friend I haven't seen for years and stil act like we're close. I value close friends a lot (i just don't like it when they're too close to me) cutting people off is so easy to me.

also I get really awkward when I see a friend of a friend in person. I always wish someone I know wouldn't bring their friends without me knowing when we're about to hang out. and if someone bring their friend without my permission, I'll automatically mark them as someone who don't value our friendship ( therefore I'll think twice if I want to hang out with them again)

 I get jealous when someone cares for their friend's well-being and here I'm like üßç.. I'm trying my best to understand people bcs it saddens me that I have idgaf attitude. I also wanna care! so I mirror everyone's attitude and I do research on how to behave like a good person. (but most of the time i just really dgaf, so it feels like my ""care"" for that person feels fake)

[gifts]

I love gifts!! I value tangible gifts such as keychains and handwritten letters. I don't read the letters but i believe my future self would want to take a peak. I love receiving but I'm not the type to write handwritten letters tho. i love the nostalgic feeling when I look at them. 

[hobbies]

Personally, I feel like me having hobbies is my core value because I get so easily obsessed about learning stuff. I once did not sleep properly for a week straight because I'm so fascinated on how abacus works. I like sharing information to people. I like to yap.

[favorite thing to do]

my favorite thing to do is to hoard notebooks, and vintage-looking things. I have a chinese painting of a mountain in my room  that I ripped off of a calendar art just cuz it's pretty and gives history vibes. I also have a plastic rose in a vase in my room.

[going outside]

I HATE going outside. I can go to places such as seaside or a park to relaxed, but going outside just for the sake of ""traveling"" or to ""play for fun"" is not fun at all!! the amount of times I have to suffer while everyone is enjoying their livesüíÄ

I love my bed. I feel comfortable to be just in my room for a whole day.

[foods]

I'm unfortunately not a foodie. I have a love and hate for chocolates. I hate coffee. I hate cola. I hate donuts. I feel like I'm gonna die if I consumed a lot of sugar. In the morning, I'd rather drink a plain hot water. my favorite foods includes water spinach and tofu. I'm pretty stubborn with what I eat. 


that's all! thanks for reading.

Does anyone else experience this?,"I have always liked the matcha latte from Starbucks, I started occasionally having it about 12 years ago. I've never drank matcha every day, it's always been occasionally. I also enjoy coffee lattes, but I noticed that coffee does give me anxiety sometimes.

I have been diagnosed with depression  and anxiety 9 years ago, also OCD more recently, and I have been taking lamotrigine for that for a while now.

Caffeine does help my intrusive thoughts, so I have it daily - usually some black tea, or oolong tea, or puerh tea. Sometimes I do go to Starbucks and get a grande matcha latte with soy milk, no sweetener.

I've noticed though lately that I think it's causing brain fog and derealization for me. It's like I suddenly feel in a fog, I can't really make any decisions, I feel spaced out. I've had a grande matcha latte yesterday and today I woke up feeling this way, spaced out. Not sure what to do with my day, feeling lost.

Does anyone else get this from matcha? I've read that a Starbucks grande latte is three scoops of matcha. Could that be the issue - that's it's just too much l-theanine? 
I don't feel this way if I have coffee - not spaced out. And I don't feel this way from brewing teas at home. 

So could the issue be the amount of matcha? I remember trying l-theanine supplement a few years ago and it also gave me a derealization episode, so I stopped the supplement. Could this be a reaction to too much l-theanine?",2,1733527450.0,BrainFog,0,1.0,False

First of all, I want to point out the huge admiration and respect I have for Britney despite not being a hardcore fan and having learned her full story just a little less than a year ago. I decided to join this sub because I was sure I would find a more balanced environment compared to other places on the Internet.

Anyway, last night I was on the phone with my sister and casually started talking about all the shit Britney's been through. The talk went on for a while, until I got quite emotional and ended up basically venting my disdain and anger at the people and systems that have done her so much harm, I even cried a little after the call was over.

Fast forward to this morning, I was on my way to work and for the first time this week, I decided to stop at a bar near my workplace to grab breakfast on the fly. Recently I've been trying to eat at home instead, to save some cash, but this time I got out of home much later than usual.

I had just got into the bar and was about to ask for a coffee at the counter, when the radio started playing *...Baby One More Time.*

I froze. I've been living and working in a new town for almost a year now, I've been to that same bar countless times, I've been in all kinds of stores, supermarkets and shops but I've NEVER heard one of her songs on the radio, actually it's been years since I've heard her music aired publicly in my country. The vibe in the bar in that moment felt unreal, too. At least two or three people including the staff had started humming and softly singing along, while I was like ""What the fuck is happening right now?"" Out of all of the songs, *that* one. Her first big hit, the one that came before all the chaos and pain, at a time she was still happy and kind of in a safe place, with the whole world ahead of her.

What are the odds?? I admit I'm not by any means a religious person but that felt like some sort of sign. Nothing like a literal ""burning bush"" kind of thing obviously, but rather something trying to comfort me. I'm still trying to wrap my head around it. Was it just random? Something bigger? I'm sure it's all because I've been overly emotional recently, but it did feel like *she* was sending me some kind of reassurance, in a way.

Now I'm here just wondering if anyone here has had similar experiences, where her music or anything connected to her just hit you out of the blue. This surely hit me HARD, believe me. I wasn't even too sure of sharing this in the first place, so I apologize if it seems inappropriate and disrespectful.",9,1733527312.0,BritneySpears,4,1.0,False

It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real¬¥ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls¬¥, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE¬¥ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you¬¥ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way.

I'm handsome, slim, and in great shape. I have deep, dark eyes and dark hair peppered with greys. I keep my facial hair short and well-groomed. I don't currently have any tattoos or piercings.

I pass regular background checks due to my job so you know I'm not shady. I have no debt or unpaid bills. I'm not addicted to anything. I don't need to be taught basic adult skills like how to care for myself or my home. You won't have to pick up after me or take an overwhelming share of the mental load. I've even kept my plants alive for years! Hopefully, you've got stability and minimal drama in your life. Ideally, you're independent and have a job that you enjoy. 

Politically, I'm a very passionate progressive/liberal. If you have some ""conservative"" values, that may not necessarily be a source of conflict. However, if you're a supporter of the modern Republican party and the MAGA movement, we are not a good fit. I'm not a religious person, but it is okay if you are as long as you can accept that I am not. Lastly, I do not have children and would prefer to date someone without children or whose kids are older and independent.

Except for a fulfilling relationship with a loving partner, I have a happy and comfortable life that doesn't want for anything. I'm capable, confident, independent, and have my life together. I want to meet someone with the intent of developing an enduring relationship. We can proceed at a pace that makes sense for us.

-------------------------
**Some things I enjoy:**

* **Food**: I have a very adventurous palate and love trying new foods. I avoid eating at the same restaurant twice to force myself to broaden my food experiences. If you're a vegan/vegetarian, that's fine! I'm open to the idea of some version of vegetarianism myself. I'm a competent cook, but I don't enjoy cooking. I'd prefer a partner who does. I promise that I'm great at doing the dishes and cleaning up in the kitchen.

* **Fitness**: My health is important, especially as I get older. I exercise regularly and also run. I'd love someone who prioritizes their health and fitness as well.

* **Coffee**: My COVID project was learning to appreciate coffee. My home ""cafe"" looks like a meth lab. I love it. I'll make you a great, fresh cup of pour-over in the morning. 

* **Riding**: I own a modern-retro scooter (a la Vespa) and enjoy riding it around the city. Don't worry, you do not need to get on the scooter if you don't want to. I promise I ride safely and with proper gear, and never speed or get on the highway.

* **Therapy**: I have been seeing a therapist for about half a year, and I'm finding it invaluable. After my previous relationships failed, I felt it was important to work on myself and set up future relationships for success. I think everyone would benefit from therapy at various points in their life.

* **Politics**: I'm a ""political junkie"". I frequently read articles and listen to podcasts. I also have a great deal of interest in the Supreme Court.

* **Movies**: I'm a huge cinephile and enjoy going to the theater. 

* **Music**: I love live music. I'm tolerant of most genres but gravitate towards indie, pop, and EDM. I like discovering new music, so if you want to share something you're vibing to and think I might like it, please share it with me.

* **Gaming**: I love to play board games with a group or my partner. I especially like games that involve some sort of social component and intuition, like The Resistance. Going out for trivia nights at bars is also one of my favorite things to do. I sometimes play single-player video games that allow me to stop at any time.

* **Cleanliness**: I'm probably the tidiest man you'll ever meet. I keep both my home and myself tidy. I'm something of a minimalist as well. I am not a big fan of collecting tons of trinkets and knickknacks and would not do well with a hoarder.

* **Drugs**: I have no dependencies or addictions whatsoever. I only drink socially and in moderation. I don't smoke *anything*, and I don't want to date someone who smokes a lot of anything. It smells gross and makes you taste gross. I sometimes enjoy a low-dose edible or a psychedelic. It's okay with me if you casually enjoy alcohol, marijuana, or ""lighter"" drugs more often than I do. 

* **Traveling**: I'm more of a homebody, but I like road trips. I want to drive across the country in a camper someday. I enjoy hiking and ""glamping"", but don't love prolonged camping. I would be agreeable to traveling far and wide with a partner.

It is perfectly fine if you don't share all my interests. I want you to be your own person with your own passions. As long as we align on our core values and ideals, the rest is not all that important.

------------
Please be serious about meeting in person. I don't want to text endlessly. If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me via chat or Reddit mail (preferred). **Please include a picture of your face with your message and describe yourself physically**. It's not much different than if we were on a dating app. I **will** ask for a picture if you didn't include one to start. Being weird about this would lead me to believe you're not serious and I'll likely move on.

------------
If you're **long-distance** (i.e. more than 2 hours away) and still interested, feel free to message me, but *only if* you're willing to make an actual effort to meet me in person after chatting for a bit. Ideally, you're in a position where you'll be able to relocate to Kansas City to live with me in a hypothetical future in which we're both committed to one another.

**Devotional: Divine Invitation ‚Äì Embracing the Call of God in Our Lives**

**Scripture Reading: Matthew 11:28-30 (NIV)**  
*‚ÄúCome to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.‚Äù*

**Reflection:**  
Every day, we are met with invitations. Some are trivial ‚Äì a dinner invitation, a coffee catch-up, or a special event. Others are profound, like the call of a lifelong partner or a pivotal career opportunity that sets our course anew. However, there is no invitation more transformative than the one given to us by God.

In the hustle of our daily lives, it‚Äôs easy to become overwhelmed, lost in our tasks, and deafened by the noise of the world. Yet God tenderly beckons ‚Äì inviting us into a deeper relationship with Him. He invites us to leave our burdens behind and embrace the life He has designed for us. This invitation isn‚Äôt just a one-time event; it‚Äôs a daily opportunity to experience His presence, love, and guidance.

God‚Äôs call often comes wrapped in moments of stillness and quiet. It beckons us to pause, to reflect, and to listen. Are you open to this divine invitation? Can you feel the gentle pull of His presence urging you toward peace, purpose, and fulfillment?

**Prayer:**  
Heavenly Father, thank You for Your unconditional love and the invitation You extend to each of us. Help us to recognize Your voice amidst the chaos and to respond with open hearts. May we lay down our burdens at Your feet and take up the life You‚Äôve set before us. Guide us in our journey and remind us that Your yoke is light. We aspire to walk closely with You, embracing each moment as a chance to serve and love as You have called us. In Jesus‚Äô name, we pray. Amen.

**Encouragement:**  
As you step into your day, remember that God is calling you not just to exist, but to thrive! His invitation is one of joy, purpose, and peace. No matter where you are in your life right now, you are included in His plans. You are invited to discover the beauty of His grace and to share that love with others.

Each time you feel weary or overwhelmed, remind yourself of His words: ‚ÄúCome to me.‚Äù Embrace this call with open arms! You are not alone; you are cherished, and you have a purpose that is uniquely yours. Let each moment be a witness to the incredible journey that unfolds when we embrace the divine invitation to walk alongside Him.

**Closing Thought:**  
Today, reflect on how you can accept this call. What steps can you take to draw closer to God? Remember, His invitation is always open, and His arms are always wide. Embrace it and watch how beautifully your life transforms.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it‚Äôs you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength‚ÄîI wish I‚Äôd had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There‚Äôs so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it‚Äôs not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian‚Äîyour mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she‚Äôs gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I‚Äôve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I‚Äôm certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup‚Äôs rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn‚Äôt know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you‚Äôll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea‚Äôs trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, ‚ÄúW-what does this mean?‚Äù

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. ‚ÄúNot here, not now. Let‚Äôs get home, then we can talk.‚Äù

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother‚Äôs shrill voice called after them, ‚ÄúLeaving already? You haven‚Äôt stayed for lunch.‚Äù

Sorin‚Äôs jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.‚Äù With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúDamn it, damn it, damn it.‚Äù

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea‚Äôs gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

‚ÄúD-do you‚Ä¶ think this could really be true?‚Äù Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. ‚ÄúLook, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might‚Äôve signed, we‚Äôll have proof.‚Äù He paused, deep in thought. ‚ÄúDad must have something lying around.‚Äù A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could‚Äôve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!‚Äù

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really know what was going on back then‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sob erupted from him. ‚ÄúI loved him so much, Drea. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another‚Äôs embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúCall Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.‚Äù

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn‚Äôt rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! That woman is going to pay today. I‚Äôve tolerated her long enough!‚Äù He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

‚ÄúAdrian, no!‚Äù

I‚Äôm looking to hopefully make a connection that leads to some romance! Posting into the Reddit void again because I‚Äôm a bit shy and dating apps have been lame again recently. üò≠

I am about 5‚Äô4ish, average size ish, mixed, dark brunette with curly hair, and brown eyes. In terms of like actual hobbies I do spend most of my free time doing fibre crafts. I do love napping when I can, I do smoke sometimes, I love collecting blind box toys, vinyl and sneakers! I also enjoy doing my makeup and tweaking my skincare routine, and self care (does this count as a hobby lol?) I love going for walks with my music blasting, and hiking when I have the time, love me some cute coffee dates and I do game very seldom sometimes on my switch. I also love dogs, if you have one send pics PLZ. ü•∞ I have an alright job, a few close friends and a boring life so overall my life is pretty quiet and drama free! ‚ú® Really just looking to share in the monotony of day to day life with someone, the highs and lows and whatever falls between those places too üòå

1h8ecww,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1h8ecww/am_i_too_much_28m/,Am I too much? 28M,"Hello,

I (28M) and her (F34) met in work and work together in the same department for over 3 years and of those years, 2 of them after the first was when we got to know eachother on a deeper level

We have eachother on all socials and text/snapchat everyday holding a streak and send memes.

At first we were colleagues.. now we are close friends... (I hope)

We went on road trips, at the start it was a group 3.. as time went on we started hanging out together just the 2 of us... going shopping... getting food.. coffee.. cinema.... just the 2 of us... and we would do it without telling anyone and would do it in private. However we never labelled it as anything it was like a mutual agreement to go together.. 

This went on for some time... and eventually I found myself being loyal to her... she would be the first person I think of before falling asleep... the first person I think of when I wake up... the person who would pop into my mind when I see something in the shop.. the feelings started to grow stronger and stronger ....Heck I still remember when I was in a bar and some other girl tool my hand during a conversation and I remember feeling so wrong because she was on my mind when it happened..

I would get her favourite snack/food when she comes with me in my car just to see her smile and be happy... again still no label.. no intentions... no moves were being made..

When we talk to eachother we would gaze into eachothers eyes closely.. I can see her eyes dilate sometimes... in a group setting when someone makes a joke...we would look at eachother first to see eachothers reaction... she would unintentionally mimic my posture at the table... we look out for eachother in work and outside of work...

Even on her holidays.. she would still message me to tell me about her day and or keep the streak.. so to me I felt special...(at least I hope she didn't feel like she had to do it)

So eventually the 'What ifs' crept into my mind and started to take over... over 1 year of living in the 'What ifs' the imaginary land of scenarios that anyone would wish for to come true...

I couldn't hold it in anymore so I had to ask her knowing well enough that i would get rejected.. but if I never ask I will never know... and if I never know... I will just live in regret...

So I asked..""Have you ever thought about us being together?'

Her immediate response 'I think we are better as friends'

There was no stutter, the words were sharp and the sentence was clear.

I was immediately teleported back to reality..everything shattered...but I still hold my head up high acting as if nothing happened... in one way I'm happy I spoke up and gave clear intentions... on the other hand reality is harsh..

So after that, I think she's mad or angry at me... feeling a little awkward... and uncomfortable... but in work... I acted like nothing happened.. putting on a mask for her sake... talking and treating her the same... for her.

Yes, it hurts me deeply on the inside... how could I let myself get so attached yet it was so easy for her to toss me (or at least that's what it feels like) ... but.... I still want her to be as happy as she can be.. even if it's not with me because she deserves the world... and I was prepared to give her that... she is the person I want to build a future with.. but we all know its a 2 way street and it requires 2 people.. 

So as of now... there's delay messages... the seen 7 hours ago etc etc... 

Am I just too committed? 

Or is there genuinely something wrong with me? 

I have my thoughts about some of the answers as I do reflect a lot but I just want that assurance...

I am willing to accept the pain to hear the answer in person rather than playing games all the time..

I would like to hear your opinion of me..

TL;DR;
2 years of friendship, frequent hangouts, just 2 of us, no label, no intentions, asked her 'Have you ever thought about us being together?' Immediate response 'I think we are better as friends'

All I want is for her to be happy, even if it's not with me

Here's the full story as to what's happened of late?

A few weeks ago, a friend whom I had been in love with for 2,5-3 years, (he says he is straight but has tried to have phone sex with me and others, it's complicated, he knew before this that I had feelings for him, on multiple occasions), drove down from Norway and picked me up in his car to go to the south of the country in Maastricht with me, we'd met each other online and had a really close friendship but had fallen out of touch, but I was so excited to meet him for the first time, and he's exactly how he is online. 

I had set him up on a blind date with another very good friend of mine, a woman, who lives around there. I was thinking my love for him would subside since I hadn't spoken with him in a month, and I didn't know if it would translate to real life. We arrive and they make it clear that they don't really find each other attractive, and we have a lovely night together having a few drinks and some dinner.

I end up getting a hotel room for the night with the Norwegian friend, not before downing 3 whisky sours, 3 beers, a glass of wine, an edible, and making the fatal, final mistake of splitting a bottle of vodka with him... I had never been drunk before. Uhh... I ended up trying to cuddle him and he had to keep me from choking on my own vomit, and then it was an awkward and quiet drive home.

My love for him came back kind of in full-swing.

I reinstalled Grindr and I don't know what came over me. I actually invited a guy over to my place for the first time. I thought by ""let's have fun"" he meant coffee or tea and a chat or the like. He did not. *Cue my first kiss and first, well, everything*... He was so lovely and attractive and came back 5 times in the past week and a half, one time we didn't even have sex. We watched a few films together, I went out and got some food for us, we cuddled and slept and honestly got really close.

The issue is? He said straight-up that he wasn't looking for anything serious, and I didn't really think about what that meant for me, at all. So I fucked things up.

I really just want a long-term relationship with someone I could grow to love and make new friends, and weirdly enough this experience has made me feel more loved and yet more lonely than ever. It's suffocating. What can I do to find likeminded people in my region? I really don't want to keep having hookups and I also don't know how to avoid things like dating apps as I'm really not comfortable with them. I've looked at studentenverenigingen (student associations), but they're all defunct/non-operational and I feel really alone.

What to do? Thanks for reading.",1,1733525908.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False
1h8e7v9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightshift/comments/1h8e7v9/my_first_week_on_3rd_shift_and_first_6_hrs_of/,"My First Week on 3rd Shift, and First 6 hrs of Sleep","I just started my first week on graveyard shift. Leading up to it was brutal. I tried staying up an extra two hours of sleep the week leading up to my first day on grave. So as many of you know the adjustment was rough. I finally got my first restful hours of sleep, which I was worried wouldn‚Äôt happen for a while. Just wanted to share what I hope will help others moving forward. 

After my first few days on shift I didn‚Äôt sleep more than 4 hours. I have a sleep mask, earplugs/ airpods, melatonin chews, blackout curtains, and pins to keep them nice and shut.


Every shift I fast, and drink a cup of coffee at the beginning of the shift, and try to walk around as much as possible. Every now and then I get outside and get some fresh air. Lots of water throughout the night. 

Then green tea around 2am. Thats the last caffeine I‚Äôll consume for the night. I‚Äôll have a quick snack before bed, in this case it was a banana. Then I‚Äôll consume the melatonin chews and for this instance, I had a magnesium packet. While falling asleep I did a breath exercise to slow down my heart rate. About 6 seconds inhale, and 6 second exhale, not too worried about counting, but more for the practice of slowing down the breath. 

I went to bed around 6:45 and woke up around 10am to pee, trying to keep as much sun out of my eyes as possible on the way to the bathroom feeling discouraged that it would be hard to go back to sleep. I was surprised to see looking at the clock that it was around 12:45 when I woke up. 

Its the small victories on this shift, I guess. I love how peaceful it is and so much more of a slower pace compared to the rest of the world. I just hope I can sustain this for the foreseeable future and wish the same for all of you here. ",7,1733525849.0,Nightshift,2,1.0,False
