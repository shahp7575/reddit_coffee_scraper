I’m exploring ideas for a SaaS tool that could help streamline some of the tedious or manual tasks in coffee roasting. If you’re using Excel, Google Sheets, or any other workaround to manage something that feels like a headache, I’d love to hear about it!

Some areas I imagine could be pain points:

* Roast logging & profiling
* Inventory management (green & roasted)
* Subscription & order fulfillment
* Customer relationship tracking (wholesale & retail)
* Quality control & cupping notes

If you could automate or simplify one thing in your workflow, what would it be? Any thoughts would be super helpful!

Thanks, and happy roasting! ☕🔥",1,1739822997.0,coffee_roasters,0,1.0,False

Part 3 of 3.*

We've previously covered Mobile, Alabama's decades-long haunting by the Gown Man, and the similar Hugging Mollies who preceded him on a grander scale. Today we delve into the Gown Man's career as it spread further across the American South, the possible meaning behind the legend, and similarities with the prolific Woman in Black phantom.

In mid-July 1920, a Gown Man frequented the neighborhood of Bradford Street, between Reynoir and Lameuse streets, in Biloxi, Mississippi. On dark nights, he roamed the local Jewish cemetery and the larger cemetery north of Reynoir Street. There had been a similar specter spotted months earlier near Crawford Street and then Lee Street, but it was unclear if this was the same Gown Man. Residents chased this latest Gown Man and were unable to catch him. Biloxi Chief of Police Bills learned of the matter and tasked Officer Michel to search for the costumed interloper. The Gown Man was spotted the night of Aug. 6 in a yard on East Washington Street. Residents, armed with pistols and shotguns, started out in search of the alleged man dressed in women's clothing. When the posse finally crossed paths with the Gown Man, they fired at least 15 shots. When the smoke cleared, the stranger was gone. The next morning, the searchers returned but found only the sheered tops of small pine trees and bushes they had blasted away with their bullets. Chief Bills soon after said he believed that imagination had much to do with the sightings of the Gown Man in various sections of Biloxi, terror spreading in whichever area he suddenly appeared. Police responded to a reported Gown Man sighting near Lee Street on Aug. 17, but found it was just a harmless old woman. She was dressed in a dark shirt with a white waist and an apron that made it appear she was wearing trousers under her dress. A similar report of a Gown Man during April 1914 in Tampa, Florida turned out to be an elderly man in a hospital gown who had escaped a local hospital.

On Feb. 11, 1921, Baton Rouge Police Captain Comeaux and Frank Schoonmaker completed a thorough search of South Baton Rouge for the Gown Man who was reported to be holding up Black residents on the lower end of town and committing various robberies. The thief wore a white bonnet and a long, flowing white gown. He was said to creep stealthily through South Baton Rouge, sticking up victims in dark alleys. ""Captain Comeaux states that the reports have been very much exaggerated,"" wrote the Baton Rogue State Times Advocate. ""After a three-day search and after questioning practically everybody in the neighborhood where the 'gown man' operates, it was found that no one has been held up, \[and\] no one knows of anyone else who has been robbed by the mysterious man."" This Gown Man, concluded the police, was merely a rumor fueled by excitement. Despite this conclusion, the Gown Man would return to Baton Rouge.

https://preview.redd.it/uqe5duglarje1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eaa343faf24dacc934e1f0d04bc6e6d64b93442

Around 1930, a character known as the ""Domino Man"" struck the sparsely inhabited Gentilly suburb of New Orleans. Development had barely begun, so there were numerous empty lots that were thickly wooded and overgrown with tall weeds. The Domino Man, dressed in a white robe and hood, waited in the trees and dropped down into the lanes to chase little girls who were on their way to school, gesticulating wildly. After frightening the children, he would leap back into the trees with ""the agility of a monkey"" and vanish. Since the kids were always too frantic afterward to be certain of his size, a theory emerged that the Domino Man was actually a monkey that someone had dressed up as a practical joke. All witnesses swore the Domino Man never attacked or followed the children very far, content to depart once they screamed and ran. Armed men had pursued the Domino Man and fired directly at him, certain their bullets had hit their target, only for the troublemaker to reappear the next day, unharmed. Some locals concluded that since most of the kids were Catholics, the Domino Man might be a Ku Klux Klan member. The KKK rode a nativist wave of Anti-Catholicism during the 1920s, holding that Catholicism conflicted with democracy. They also believed that parochial schools encouraged separatism which kept young Catholics from growing into loyal Americans. So apparently their way to solve that issue was by leaping at children from trees?

In July 1934, the Gown Man targeted and robbed several African-American citizens on the southern outskirts of Baton Rouge. The Morning Advocate described him as ""a very real bogey man"" who dressed in ""an appallingly long black gown"" underneath which he carried a big pistol. Witnesses described the Gown Man as ""tall and fierce."" He robbed a pedestrian of his cash on July 10, then went on a spree the next night, stealing five cents from one victim and $4.85 from another before frightening an elderly man ""almost into fits."" A woman named Annabelle, a cook at a local boarding house, said she had been asking her employer to leave work early before it got dark. This followed an incident in which the Gown Man beat a man who didn't have any money nearly to death. A number of residents were barring their doors and remaining in their homes once evening fell. The Gown Man, however, met his match in a man named McCuir. The mugger cornered McCuir in a blind alley, pistol raised. But McCuir gave in to his instinct to run and plowed right through the Gown Man, knocking the criminal down and tromping him as he fled. Police and deputies, vowing to catch and unveil the disguised predator, responded to a call on July 17 but the Gown Man had vanished by the time they arrived.

The Baton Rouge Morning Advocate boldly declared on Aug. 5 that, ""While the 'Gown-Man' has grown to be a spectral figure of terror, still there isn't such a person."" Police had unraveled the sinister trail of the hooded ""hi-jacking terror"" and ""found there only a maze of hood-winking with a bit of supernatural fear thrown in."" Anxiety over the Gown Man persisted in Baton Rouge, with some young men courting serious legal trouble by carrying around guns for personal protection during their evening perambulations.

When the Gown Man first appeared in Baton Rouge, garbed in either women's pajamas or a short robe, some residents feared he might be Gabriel Talley, who was wanted years earlier in Iberville Parish for the brutal murder of a woman with a cane-knife. Son Talley, Gabriel's brother, was tried and sentenced to prison in Baton Rouge for a different killing. While on the lam, Gabriel had frequently visited relatives in Baton Rouge dressed as a woman to conceal his identity. Locals spotted him but were afraid to report his presence to police. But as more stories began to circulate and the stature of the desperado grew, he was said to be the ghost of a Baton Rouge police officer. ""Finally, he became just the 'Gown-Man'—the symbol of fear,"" wrote the Morning Advocate.

According to Deputy Sheriff Ed Whitney, who beat the streets of South Baton Rouge seeking an answer to the mystery, there was an actual basis to the now pervasive tales of the Gown Man. It had started with the mugger who had been trampled by one of his intended victims (McCuir) the previous month. Dressed in a short robe or raincoat with a dark hat pulled low over his eyes, this particular Gown Man had successfully robbed three local Black residents. But the man, who was also Black, had been arrested after robbing a white man and was by then confined to jail at Edgard, so he couldn't be the Gown Man still bedeviling Baton Rouge.

Whitney said it was possible that there had been additional hold-ups performed by other men dressed as the Gown Man. There was also a ""veritable maze"" of practical jokes. In one instance, a local resident hung a hat and old cloak on a coat hanger, attached it to a string, and ran the string over a telegraph pole and then to some bushes. When a group approached, the practical joker yanked on the string and the spectral figure arose, jostling around and startling the pedestrians before vanishing when the operator released the string. ""Those who saw the flapping figure told a harrowing story of fierce pursuit and narrow escape,"" it was reported. 

The Big Easy also had its own Gown Man, who aroused curiosity and fear during the last couple months of 1934. Walter Fervas was accosted while walking alone in downtown New Orleans around midnight. On the vague edge of light cast by infrequent lampposts, Fervas saw against a dark wall the form of a darker figure, tall but shapeless, its head a monstrous, angular shadow. It called out to Fervas, not in a ghostly croak but in a low, truculent voice. Fervas whirled around and ran, looking back to see the dark figure flapping in pursuit. The chased man careened across vacant lots, following a shortcut to his home on Touro Street, between Hope and Duels streets. Hearing the Gown Man curse behind him, Fervas plunged into his house, slammed the door shut and bolted it. ""Gownman,"" he told his frightened wife between panting, ""chased me all the way home.""

""He was a tall man, well over six feet,"" Fervas recalled. ""He was dressed in a long black gown that touched his feet, and he had on a black sunbonnet that shaded his face so you couldn't see it at all."" Fervas and his neighbors began observing 9 p.m. curfew on a long stretch centering about Annette Street, back of town and in town, and between Claiborne and Broad streets, as far in as Bourbon Street.

Some New Orleans residents said that Fervas got off easy, as they knew others who had been caught, robbed and beaten by the Gown Man. The fiend was said to lurk in the branches of sycamore trees that hung over a block of Bourbon Street near Dorgenois, diving down onto passersby ""like a snakebird dives under water,"" pinning his victim to the sidewalk. Neighbors recalled that the Gown Man had robbed a boy of $3.50 and then beat up another young man who didn't have any money. They said the Gown Man was not new to the neighborhood, having been seen for the previous two or three years, but only in winter. ""People run too fast when they are not tied up in overcoats,"" one resident suggested. 

[A 1934 illustration of the New Orleans Gown Man, published in the New Orleans Item-Tribune. Included here on a Fair Use, educational basis.](https://preview.redd.it/448lrcioarje1.png?width=166&format=png&auto=webp&s=729ee29ba0a0807e0cb840e44ab8f4809553c4fa)

The Gown Man was so prolific that New Orleans citizens assumed there must be more than one. He had been sighted in and outside town, in the Treme on Orleans Street, farther out than Broad, almost at the river, even uptown. Among the suspected Gown Men was ""Chicken Charley,” a violent neighborhood criminal, although police had no recent record of him. A ""notorious brigand"" nicknamed ""Stack of Dollars"" was another suspect. The Gown Men were thought to inhabit and change their regalia in a vacant building on Prieur Street, a former grocery. 

Marcel Fortune, who lived near the abandoned grocery, was walking past it at about 1:30 a.m. when he heard a voice call, ""Fortune!"" He looked down the dark alley next to the deserted building and saw a Black man standing there in the shadows. ""Where are you going?"" the stranger inquired. ""To work,"" answered Fortune. ""No, you're not,"" the stranger retorted. ""You're going to spend the night here with me."" Fortune noticed a rolled-up bundle of black cloth at the stranger's side, and the mystery man smiled evilly. ""I know you, but you don't know who I am,"" he said. ""You didn't know I was a gownman, did you? And there are three more in the alley."" Fortune then heard additional voices emanating from said alley. Just then, an older man came walking down the opposite sidewalk. Fortune called to him and ran across, the Gown Man shouting curses behind him but not following. Fortune decided not to report the incident to police out of fear that the Gown Men might retaliate. His older brother and a friend escorted him to his job at the Van Geffen Bakery moving forward. 

As real a threat as the Gown Man, or men, were to New Orleans residents, to police it was just a vague rumor that the African-American community had developed amongst itself. Citizens began discussing going out armed and in groups to bring an end to the Gown Man's terror. 

A marauder nicknamed ""The Black Phantom,"" ""The Skirt Man"" and ""Huggy Molly"" spread fear throughout the residential section of Montgomery, Alabama bordering the State Normal School (today Alabama State University) in August 1943. Police authenticated two attacks on young women in their rooms. The Black Phantom entered the home of a teacher and slapped his daughter before fleeing. He then did the same to the daughter of Rufus Williams, manager of the Nu Deal Taxi Company. Descriptions of the phantom varied, other than him being a Black man who was focusing his mischief on members of the African-American community. 

Huggy Molly eluded police and citizens for some time but by Aug. 11 had failed to appear for several days. Police suspected that a pursuing mob might have finally caught up to the Black Phantom and beaten him so severely that he was unable to continue his depredations. ""It was admitted, however, that however elusive the phantom might be, the excitement and fear engendered by his two known acts were still present and very real,"" reported the Montgomery Advertiser. On the night of Aug. 22, two men were trailing a masked man who suddenly turned around at the corner of Morgan and Stone streets and fired a pistol at them. Police, who scoured the neighborhood for several hours afterward unsuccessfully, did not believe their quarry was the much talked about Skirt Man.

The Gown Man was still active in New Orleans in 1945, at least within the rich traditions of the city's African-American denizens recorded by the Louisiana Writers Project. ""The Gown Man is tall and slim and wears a black cap and long black gown that reaches to the ground,"" said Olivia Collins, who resided at Camp Street near the levee of the Mississippi River. ""He has a long black automobile, I done seen it, parked down at the bottom of the levee."" Collins said that the Gown Man would approach women, but not if a man was around. She was uncertain of his race. ""I know one thing,"" Collins concluded. ""He's a real man, and not no ghost!"" Other residents, however., were certain that the Gown Man was a phantom, driving his long, shiny car around the neighborhood of the levee. When he showed up in other sections of the city, he would drop out of the trees and send women ""fleeing and screaming for their lives and virtues.""

https://preview.redd.it/64j2i3dsarje1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86442020274a144ed64189c3734a1ef0c465d12

The Gown Man bears a striking resemblance to the Woman in Black, another wraith of the witching hour that prowled city streets across the United States during the same era. While these wispy-thin ladies dressed head-to-toe in black mourning clothes were mostly spectral in nature, gliding along at inhuman speeds and dispersing suddenly into thin air—there was also a subset described as flesh-and-blood men in drag who accosted pedestrians. One such example was the Greenville Ghost, who bred hysteria throughout Jersey City, New Jersey in the winter of 1901-02. This ghost was more accurately described as a six-foot-tall, muscular man dressed in deep black women's clothing with a hat and heavy veil. He grabbed and sometimes hugged lone women, and on some occasions was reported to rough them up. Any man who tried to interfere found themselves knocked senseless by the Black Ghost. Armed groups of citizens, including children, patrolled the streets looking for the prowler. Police finally revealed that they had identified the ghost as a local man, who happened to be Black, and had a penchant for practical jokes. He was warned to cease his moonlight activities or face punishment. However, other reporting contradicted this identification, with police suggesting the whole story was either an exaggeration or a tall tale. I rehash this story to demonstrate how similar some of the Lady in Black stories were to the contemporaneous Gown Man. 

The Woman in Black appears to have frequently been a northeastern and midwestern U.S. phenomenon, occurring in communities that ranged greatly from diverse urban cities to rural coal-mining towns. It is possible that the Gown Man might represent a unique southern variation of the same theme, one which arose predominately in African-American communities. It appears that Hugging Molly as a name for this entity evolved into the Gown Man, as they occupied the same region and presented similar dress and behaviors. An 1894 article in the Daily Enquirer of Columbus, Georgia underlined the connection between the Woman in Black and Hugging Molly, writing, ""Have you seen the Lady in Black? She is a ghost-like apparition on the 'Hugging Molly' order, which flits around at night, but seems intangible. A mortal dread has fallen upon the community and many people are afraid to poke their heads outdoors after night. Who or what is the Lady in Black?"" In Part 2 of this series, we explored Abbeville, Alabama folk tales about Hugging Molly and the Woman in Black that might be connected.

In an early report dating back to October 1867, the gender of the Woman in Black was already in question. Citizens of Milan, Ohio proposed that the witching-hour phantom stalking their streets and evading capture—a six-foot-tall, heavily built figure garbed in a black dress—might actually be a man. 

As pointed out by author and folklorist Chris Woodyard in his excellent articles about the Woman in Black, these stories appear to reflect societal norms of the era which viewed cross-dressing as an aberration that was not to be trusted. It didn't seem to matter whether the ""Woman in Black"" was a thief masquerading in disguise or an innocent man who wished to express his sexual identity by appearing in public dressed in women's clothing, albeit safely obscured by a veil. Starting in the mid-1800s, more than 40 cities across the nation passed laws criminalizing cross-dressing. Gender inappropriateness or variance was viewed as an amoral sickness and a public offense.

Although this intolerant attitude is infrequently stated directly in stories about the Woman in Black, Hugging Molly and Gown Man, it clearly underpins the fear of these boogeymen that links the various cases. Aspersions, however, are coded in the use of the term ""Hugging Molly"" to refer to cross-dressing prowlers and muggers. In 18th century London, ""Molly"" was a slur used for effeminate, gay men, with ""Molly Houses"" describing ""the clubs, taverns, inns, or coffee houses where they met up in secret,"" according to the British Newspaper Archive. Homosexuality was punishable by law, with sentences ranging from standing in the pillory, to jail time, up to execution for sodomy, depending on the individual case and evidence. So, these venues offered a safe and private place for men to openly express their sexual identities and find acceptance, even though the ""Molly Houses"" were at constant risk of being raided by police. Interestingly, a member of the Folklore and Mythology subreddit named LeanBean512 recalled hearing the term ""Huggin' Molly"" used colloquially in Mississippi ""as a put down to describe a pathetic man, like a pervert or a flasher,"" so a pejorative use of the term appears to persist in the present day, possibly connected to the Hugging Molly legend.

Unlike the Woman in Black, the Gown Man was infrequently ascribed a supernatural nature. A corporeal man, sometimes an entire gang, was assumed to be masquerading in clothing of the opposite gender. The Gown Man was often feared as a robber, but like Hugging Molly before him, just as often engaged in mischief designed to scare, prank and stupefy his victims. Whatever his crimes, the Gown Man was viewed as a legitimate threat and a reason to dread walking alone at night. Residents reacted with outrage, and police appear to have taken the reports seriously. While some of the news articles might contain journalistic sensationalism, they seem to have documented a mix of truth and mass hysteria, likely perpetuating the latter. Some of the Gown Men were arrested, named and tried. Others just vanished into the void from which they came. Perhaps some criminals and pranksters were inspired by stories of Gown Men and dressed the part, or just took advantage of a concealing, obfuscating disguise, blending into the overall legend.

Another Woman in Black of an earthly nature forlornly wandered the streets of Louisville, Kentucky in October 1868, ringing doorbells late at night and then failing to acknowledge in any way the confused residents who answered. While not suggested to be a disguised man, the Louisville Courier-Journal wrote, ""She is very large, weighing two hundred pounds perhaps, which precludes the idea that she is a ghost or spirit. She is clad in black from head to foot; a black bonnet covering up her face in the ancient style; a black vail hanging over the bonnet; a black shawl; a black dress. At a distance she looks like a small-sized hearse.""

New Orleans did have its own Woman in Black for at least six months in 1869, somberly dressed as she strolled along the ""almost solitary desert"" of the levee from Luggars' Bay to the Morgan Steamship Landing. She promenaded like clockwork each night, appearing with the first shade of evening and vanishing before the first streak of daylight, even in inclement weather. The lady was tangible, distrustful police having arrested and brought her to the station at least a dozen times. She always gave police a different name, such as Virginia, Mary or just Madame. The woman was thought to be perennially vigilant for a friend she expected to arrive on a ship, one which was unfortunately destined never to reach port. The Woman in Black offered no objection when other pedestrians chose to accompany her through the labyrinth of boxes and bales along the pier, and responded to queries with education, intelligence and dignity. But at the first indication of day, she hastened off like a scared ghost. It is interesting to note that the New Orleans Woman in Black, like the Gown Man, was a strange living character rather than an outright phantasm.

Maybe it is just coincidence, but these masked and costumed nocturnal marauders like the Gown Man share some commonalities with fictional superheroes like The Shadow and Batman that became popular during the first half of the 20th century. While standing on the opposite side of justice, and preferring capes over dresses, such superheroes similarly catered to a public fascination with masked mystery men lurking on our city streets. 

But a more apt comparison is probably Candyman (memorably portrayed by Tony Todd), the serial killer of urban legend created by Clive Barker for the titular film series that began in 1992. In the films, Candyman emerges as a Bloody-Mary like specter of fear in the primarily African-American public housing project of Cabrini-Green Homes in Chicago. The Candyman myth is presented throughout the films as a community reaction to generations of racial injustice and the murders of innocent Black men. This includes Candyman himself, an African-American artist and son of a slave who was lynched in the late 1800s over his relationship with a white woman. Despite his origin, the feared Candyman kills residents of Cabrini-Green when needed to keep his legend alive. Although the Gown Man was a much less lethal character, could he have developed in a similar way to the fictional Candyman within African-American communities across the American South? 

Enigmatic phantom assailants have materialized throughout the centuries to frighten communities for a period of time and then vanish back into the shadows, a phenomenon explored by Robert E. Bartholomew and Paul Weatherhead in their excellent 2024 book, ""Social Panics & Phantom Attackers."" Fearsome fiends of this order have included Spring-Heeled Jack in 1830's England, phantom Zeppelins in 1909 New Zealand, the Mad Gasser of Mattoon, Illinois in 1944, and the 2001 Monkey Man scare in New Delhi, India. ""These sagas are powerful human creations that reflect prominent fears in society at any given time,"" wrote Bartholomew and Weatherhead. The authors argue that these outbreaks do not derive from any external bogeyman, but from human imagination fueled by our prevailing anxieties and deepest terrors. For example, the Mad Gasser coincided with widespread press speculation that the failing German military might resort to chemical weapon attacks on American cities during the waning months of World War 2. This existential fright was transposed into a local threat in which an unseen marauder was indiscriminately spraying poison gas into household windows across Mattoon. These mysterious assailants can evolve into urban myth and serve as cautionary tales, such as emphasizing the dangers to young women which lurk in a city's dark alleys at night.

Although each social panic has a unique context and the form of the aggressor varies, these is a discernible pattern that plays out across time and the world. According to Bartholomew and Weatherhead, a community will unconsciously create a scapegoat for their problems in the form of evil-doers, which unites them against a common enemy. Often, vigilante groups will form and patrol the streets, at times accusing innocent parties of being the mystery assailant. People, suddenly hyper-aware of their surroundings, begin seeing sinister threats all around them. Many residents will stay inside their homes, which impacts the local economy during the scare. Initially, authorities and the press add oxygen to the claims, investigating reports and taking them seriously. Due to the prevalence of incidents, they might assume there are multiple assailants operating in different areas. But after failing to find any supporting evidence, and encountering misidentifications and hoaxes, authorities and the same media that gave the claims credence begin to shed doubt on the whole phenomenon, even ridiculing sightings as flights of imagination. Further witnesses become hesitant to come forward, and the entire threat withers. 

Phantom assailants are not the territory of the weak-minded; everyone is susceptible to self-deception, our perception and memory highly prone to influence by external pressures. It is just part of the human condition. ""Our eyes do not simply reflect what is in our environment; our brains have a major influence on how we perceive the world and prime people to see what they expect to see,"" wrote Bartholomew and Weatherhead. As is evident in reviewing the multitude of cases explored in this series, the Gown Man, Hugging Molly and Woman in Black closely fit the patterns these authors identify in phantom assailants.

Hugging Molly and the Gown Man first appeared in the decades following emancipation, and the timing closely parallels the rise of the KKK. Did fears of the hate group and its disguised members (not to mention everyday racism) blend with similar tropes of ghostly ladies and enshrouded thieves from elsewhere in the country? If so, why were so many of the Gown Men unmasked to reveal they were Black men preying on their own communities? It suggests ever-present anxieties couched in the familiar, a menace that is close to home, material and frightening, yet also less dangerous, more vague and more controllable than an outside threat. The Woman in Black, Hugging Molly and the Gown Man all symbolize a general fear and warning of walking alone in the dark through urbanized areas. Yet the latter two entities appear to uniquely reflect the trauma of African-Americans who were establishing themselves as newly freed individuals in a South that had within living memory completely oppressed them.

**POSTSCRIPT:** I am writing this article as a 21st century white man and amateur folklorist who lives in the northeastern U.S. I am certainly open to hearing differing opinions and expertise from those with a more educated perspective on race relations in late 19th century/early 20th century America. I began writing this lengthy essay after stumbling upon a reference to the mysterious ""Gown Man"" in an article about the Monster of Marmotte Street. Once I realized it was a prolific character who appeared in news and lore from the American South over the course of several decades, I decided it was worth documenting and compiling an article on the phenomenon. My topmost goal is the preservation of American history and folklore that has mostly been forgotten, and to hopefully provide some valuable context about the era and place from which it originated. It would have been dishonest to ignore the fact that these stories center mostly on African-American communities in the American South during a time fraught with racial tension in the decades following the Civil War. Perhaps I am wrong about a visceral connection between the Gown Man and the KKK, although some contemporary articles also drew that comparison. In my opinion, the Gown Man/Hugging Molly is a unique piece of Southern folklore, likely connected to some real incidents, that is best remembered, understood and even celebrated for its uniqueness in the present day.

1irtede,https://www.reddit.com/r/SamsungDex/comments/1irtede/sotsu_flipaction_14_go_and_touch_reviews/,"SOTSU Flipaction 14"" GO and Touch Review(s)","As always, not journalists, but we're doing our best to be fair, even, etc and present these items from the DeX and/or mobile computing viewpoint.

  
Sotsu was kind enough to send a couple of monitors, and their USB-C hub to review.   The Hub will have it's own thread at some point, for today, focusing on their portable 14"" monitors.

  
SOTSU has sent over their 14"" Flipaction Touch, and GO monitors.   They're virtually identical, except that the Touch has a touchscreen, and the GO does not.    The GO also does NOT come packaged with the magnetic stand.

  
[https://www.sotsu.com/products/flipaction-go-14?variant=45424873013474](https://www.sotsu.com/products/flipaction-go-14?variant=45424873013474)

  
[https://www.sotsu.com/products/flipaction-touch-14?variant=46062271922402](https://www.sotsu.com/products/flipaction-touch-14?variant=46062271922402)

[Flipaction Touch on the stand, and the rear view of the GO](https://preview.redd.it/rg9iey73rqje1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e13b4644d96aa083aeeb5ea1d1bdd40306f77497)

  
On quick glance the monitors are almost identical.  Both are all aluminum chassis, with a rotating kickstand containing a USB-C input, mini-HDMI input, and a USB-C PD port.   The back of the kickstand, also contains the flush mounted, 4 way button, used to interact with the Onscreen Display (OSD).

  
Both monitors are 1080p, running at 60hz.    The Touch has slightly better contrast ratio, at 1500:1, vs the 1200:1 of the GO, but I'm not sure you'd be able to tell with the naked eye.   Even side by side with the same content I hard a hard time telling which was which at a distance.

  
Both support 100% of the DCI-P3 colour gamut, and both are just simply beautiful panels to look at, with about 400nits of brightness.

  
These are just simple monitors tho, no batteries, no built in speakers.  They're just simply really nice panels

  
The wild part of all this, is that the GO states it uses 5W of power (max) and the Touch states it uses 4W (max).

  
A quick test shows me that typical use while using DeX is actually much less:

[Flipaction Touch uses under 3w of power in typical use](https://preview.redd.it/3752rxzrsqje1.jpg?width=2103&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfb904349ebc9e9c49ca52d53be1bbad80d9ec7a)



Both monitors are very solid, all aluminum construction.   Both weigh around 700g, with the touchscreen weighing slightly less at 675g.

  
The secret sauce for this portable monitor is the rotating kickstand, and the magnetic base stand (included with the touch, but extra on the GO)

  
The Rotating kickstand allows you to use the monitor in essentially 3 main configurations (2 without the base).

[Flipaction GO, kickstand](https://preview.redd.it/8ncldr9itqje1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c51a1d994bf783a063de9996ed0fe76b881159e)

The main/default mode is going to be to just simply prop the monitor up, sitting on your desk.   The hinge on the monitor is very firm, and will essentially hold at any angle you set it at.  Talking with the SOTSU founder, he stated:



\>All the hinges on the monitor are tested to last for 8+ years with daily operations. We have tested both on fatigue machines and manually tested internally. The chance of them failing is very small.

  
And having fiddled with them for a couple weeks now, I absolutely believe that.   The Touch will likely be in heavy rotation for me, so we'll revisit this in a year.



You can rotate the base 90 degrees, and obtain a portrait orientation on the monitor

https://preview.redd.it/jh6r60kjuqje1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00fa64c709a74276e75abcde0aec3c2b87182f20

  
This is obviously not useful in DeX currently, but works fine for other OS machines (Steam Deck, Surface pro, etc)



The magnetic base is awesome.    I'm not sure I can overstate how great the magnetic base is.  

[SOTSU magnetic Base for the GO and Touch](https://preview.redd.it/tc27wsusuqje1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a7879c5c0afa0208c8d592086d0294dae463299)

  
The magnetic base is what really elevates the SOTSU monitor above most of it's competitors (see what I did there?)   It folds flat, and magnets to the back of the monitor (just to the right of the kickstand in this view), and the hinge is VERY firm.   You can put the monitor at virtually any angle, and the base stand will hold it there.....possibly forever

[Flipaction touch on the magnetic base](https://preview.redd.it/lj11x8g7vqje1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=155f2e849ea807080e8c8f9bdedb5d47e4da3b3e)



[slim package](https://preview.redd.it/kzz7bhpavqje1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=71fa742ace22d4bd677dd67fbc51e91e24a7d810)

The sideview of the whole things give you an idea of just how sleek the whole package is, and have angle adjustment on the base as well as the kickstand really lets you dial in the monitor placement, for ergonomics, and the ability to avoid glare

[The rear, in standard formation](https://preview.redd.it/9lzfzqfkvqje1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e4d54424a79311a8a225bdc89b67877293fbe00)



This is kind of the basic use case.   Flip out the kickstand, insert the magnetic base (it clips together very satisfyingly) and get to work.

[Portrait mode](https://preview.redd.it/i7gsg4sqvqje1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69c4c76c921fe9b52374e25200606bd09dc5dc69)

  
You can easily rotate the monitor to portrait while everything is connection.   The monitor spins fairly freely, but clicks into portrait or landscape spots.    Easy to adjust, but won't go askew if you bump it

[Tall boy mode](https://preview.redd.it/b1awn90yvqje1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2fdd82d3c30b6d9c7e6f3d6a92cce1fbb905983f)

  
I'm sure there's a proper term for this, but this is what my caffeine starved brain came up with today.   This was the mode that interested me the most.    It holds the monitor up HIGH, makes for a MUCH more ergonomic setup when typing at a desk, while at the same time, also allows you to position it around other devices.....      I don't have a tab S, but with my similar sized Surface pro, you can see the intent of this mode:

[Still just a single cable to power the monitor](https://preview.redd.it/1v5d8b0bwqje1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f538fea1773b3096a216dcbf4017d309fc59e26b)



Just for comparison, you obviously can do the same with just a phone

https://preview.redd.it/8dade6nfwqje1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db08d3ec82902438bdb5d92b2bd34517dc6fcdec

  
If you have to have a device that has multiple USB-C 4 (or tb4) ports, you can even use both monitors at the same time, a single cable for each

[SOTSU Touch on top, SOTSU GO on bottom, and Surface pro to the right](https://preview.redd.it/pj1jfhomwqje1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff88940c5d1bd8c815865c56c8724d43f8db0c87)

2 cables, 3 screens, and you're still getting 6+ hours of work time, all on one battery.

As a DeX and Surface guy, it's really really awesome to see monitors aimed at us.    The monitors are so low powered, you can use them on battery for hours, and not sweat it.

  
Oh, and did I mention that the touchscreen, also happens to support MPP pens (microsoft pens)?

I can use the Surface pen 2 from my Surface pro with the monitor, with absolutely no issues.

  


[The pen even clips to the monitor](https://preview.redd.it/ihdypmi4yqje1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a268abd3384e44b8777fe1c348a90b9503716699)

  
It works fairly similarly to how the s-pen works on the phone/tablet screen

[Selecting items with the pen](https://preview.redd.it/pjjvlji4yqje1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea850eccc939f5e5a1b278a387693d936273ab8c)

I don't use my s-pen, or my surface pen a TON, but when I do, it's a pretty great experience.   it's VERY nice to have the option to continue to use it on the SOTSU.   The S-pen is not MPP, so unfortunately isn't going to carry over from your tablet, or ultra.    If you're not a surface person tho, there are a ton of MPP pens out there, at a wide range of prices, so it's pretty easy to add one into the mix.

SOTSU does also have their own pen:

[https://www.sotsu.com/products/sotsu-stylus-pen?variant=46158404518114](https://www.sotsu.com/products/sotsu-stylus-pen?variant=46158404518114)

It looks a TON like the standard Surface pen, but has usb-c charging.

So something else caught my eye as I was handling the monitor and stand.   I noticed that there's what looks like a usb-c port on the kickstand.....

https://preview.redd.it/1qgidsey5rje1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a82a0d10ced3dce8a60cfcb2ebe0a341c65aadd

  
There's a matching one on the magnetic base

https://preview.redd.it/wupewrx16rje1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cdf682d15aa86d737adedcae966216a2a43e1ff6

  
I originally assumed it was just a guide, to help seat the kickstand to the base, but SOTSU confirmed that the USB-C in the kickstand is fully functional, and they're looking at adding a built in hub to the magnetic base, potentially

  
It's always great to see forward thinking like that, and I'm really curious to see what they had in mind.

# Final Thoughts

  


The SOTSU Flipaction Touch is a fantastic DeX portable monitor.   The magnetic base truly puts it in almost it's own category, as it allows a proper ergonomic desk, even if you're at a convention center, hotel room, or a coffee shop.    The package folds almost completely flat, and can be stored in a nice neoprene sleeve.   

The monitor sips power, and will not crater your phone battery after an hour of use.



I can't stress how well engineered these are.    1 last shot, this is a stack of 2x SOTSU monitors AND my surface pro

That little bundle is a complete 3 monitor setup, keyboard and mouse, and easily slides into any tech backpack, and wouldn't be too bad to carry around every day.



  
The main issue here is going to be the premium price

  
At the time of this writing, the Flipaction Touch 14"" is listed at $532 canuckbucks,  $369 USD,  €360 

  
The non-touch version GO is $388 canuckbucks, $269 USD, €260



Essentially $100usd difference for the touch version (which also comes with the base,  a $70 usd value)

  
it's pricey, but the base is absolutely worth it.



Anyway, thoughts?  comments?   anything obvious I've missed?

  
Long story short, it's awesome, but it's still just a 1080p60 14"" monitor.  The price is definitely on the premium side",1,1739822860.0,SamsungDex,0,1.0,False
1irtds3,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14402863/Apple-Cider-Vinegar-Jessica-Ainscough-Belle-Gibson.html,Jess Aincough’s dad is livid about her portrayal through Milla,"
The grieving father of an Australian 'wellness warrior' has slammed her portrayal in Netflix's popular new series about cancer faker Belle Gibson as 'appalling'.

This month marks 10 years since Australian teen magazine editor turned wellness entrepreneur Jessica Ainscough, 29, lost her battle with a rare form of cancer after shunning conventional medical treatment.

Now her father Col is reliving the trauma of Jessica's death because of what he says is her 'inaccurate' portrayal in Netflix's new show, Apple Cider Vinegar, which retells the 'true-ish story' based on the lies of Gibson.

Mr Ainscough claimed the show is full of painful inaccuracies, including that Jessica was friends with Gibson, who pretended to have cured brain cancer with alternative therapies.

He also lost his wife Sharyn to cancer 18 months before his only child Jessica.


Although he admitted to not watching the series himself, he's been told of its contents, which he described as 'insensitive and clearly profit-driven'. 

Jessica had worked as an online editor for the popular Australian magazine Dolly prior to being diagnosed with epithelioid sarcoma in 2008.

She had noticed lumps forming on her left arm and was given a bleak chance of surviving the cancer.


One of the treatments she tried was Gerson therapy, which saw her drink juices every hour and undergo several coffee enemas every day.

Despite being portrayed in the series as being unsupportive of Jessica's holistic remedies, Mr Ainscough said he also felt 'Jess had no real option but to seek alternatives'.

It also does a great job of showing how traditional medicine’s heavy-handed hostility towards patients’ curiosity about alternative therapies can push people further away from standard treatments. 

But if you stop watching mid-way through the series, you may walk away feeling more curious about alternative medicine than ever before. This isn’t a criticism of the series necessarily. Anything can be misinterpreted. I wonder if more foreshadowing of what was to come or showing more adverse outcomes to Hirsch therapy (Gerson therapy irl) could have prevented such a sharp uptake in searches about the benefits of coffee enemas?  With Milla’s mom having bowel cancer, one could incorrectly assume that her specific form of cancer is what made coffee enemas ineffective. Milla is an amalgamation of wellness influencers but is obviously heavily based on Jessica Ainscough. Jessica’s own mother died of breast cancer and having Milla’s mom have a cancer unrelated to the digestive system might have expressed the dangers of coffee enemas more clearly.

Part 3 of 3.*

We've previously covered Mobile, Alabama's decades-long haunting by the Gown Man, and the similar Hugging Mollies who preceded him on a grander scale. Today we delve into the Gown Man's career as it spread further across the American South, the possible meaning behind the legend, and similarities with the prolific Woman in Black phantom.

In mid-July 1920, a Gown Man frequented the neighborhood of Bradford Street, between Reynoir and Lameuse streets, in Biloxi, Mississippi. On dark nights, he roamed the local Jewish cemetery and the larger cemetery north of Reynoir Street. There had been a similar specter spotted months earlier near Crawford Street and then Lee Street, but it was unclear if this was the same Gown Man. Residents chased this latest Gown Man and were unable to catch him. Biloxi Chief of Police Bills learned of the matter and tasked Officer Michel to search for the costumed interloper. The Gown Man was spotted the night of Aug. 6 in a yard on East Washington Street. Residents, armed with pistols and shotguns, started out in search of the alleged man dressed in women's clothing. When the posse finally crossed paths with the Gown Man, they fired at least 15 shots. When the smoke cleared, the stranger was gone. The next morning, the searchers returned but found only the sheered tops of small pine trees and bushes they had blasted away with their bullets. Chief Bills soon after said he believed that imagination had much to do with the sightings of the Gown Man in various sections of Biloxi, terror spreading in whichever area he suddenly appeared. Police responded to a reported Gown Man sighting near Lee Street on Aug. 17, but found it was just a harmless old woman. She was dressed in a dark shirt with a white waist and an apron that made it appear she was wearing trousers under her dress. A similar report of a Gown Man during April 1914 in Tampa, Florida turned out to be an elderly man in a hospital gown who had escaped a local hospital.

On Feb. 11, 1921, Baton Rouge Police Captain Comeaux and Frank Schoonmaker completed a thorough search of South Baton Rouge for the Gown Man who was reported to be holding up Black residents on the lower end of town and committing various robberies. The thief wore a white bonnet and a long, flowing white gown. He was said to creep stealthily through South Baton Rouge, sticking up victims in dark alleys. ""Captain Comeaux states that the reports have been very much exaggerated,"" wrote the Baton Rogue State Times Advocate. ""After a three-day search and after questioning practically everybody in the neighborhood where the 'gown man' operates, it was found that no one has been held up, \[and\] no one knows of anyone else who has been robbed by the mysterious man."" This Gown Man, concluded the police, was merely a rumor fueled by excitement. Despite this conclusion, the Gown Man would return to Baton Rouge.

https://preview.redd.it/157fsjk59rje1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c01d4c8a33a030eca43708c32c755f5769e5962e

Around 1930, a character known as the ""Domino Man"" struck the sparsely inhabited Gentilly suburb of New Orleans. Development had barely begun, so there were numerous empty lots that were thickly wooded and overgrown with tall weeds. The Domino Man, dressed in a white robe and hood, waited in the trees and dropped down into the lanes to chase little girls who were on their way to school, gesticulating wildly. After frightening the children, he would leap back into the trees with ""the agility of a monkey"" and vanish. Since the kids were always too frantic afterward to be certain of his size, a theory emerged that the Domino Man was actually a monkey that someone had dressed up as a practical joke. All witnesses swore the Domino Man never attacked or followed the children very far, content to depart once they screamed and ran. Armed men had pursued the Domino Man and fired directly at him, certain their bullets had hit their target, only for the troublemaker to reappear the next day, unharmed. Some locals concluded that since most of the kids were Catholics, the Domino Man might be a Ku Klux Klan member. The KKK rode a nativist wave of Anti-Catholicism during the 1920s, holding that Catholicism conflicted with democracy. They also believed that parochial schools encouraged separatism which kept young Catholics from growing into loyal Americans. So apparently their way to solve that issue was by leaping at children from trees?

In July 1934, the Gown Man targeted and robbed several African-American citizens on the southern outskirts of Baton Rouge. The Morning Advocate described him as ""a very real bogey man"" who dressed in ""an appallingly long black gown"" underneath which he carried a big pistol. Witnesses described the Gown Man as ""tall and fierce."" He robbed a pedestrian of his cash on July 10, then went on a spree the next night, stealing five cents from one victim and $4.85 from another before frightening an elderly man ""almost into fits."" A woman named Annabelle, a cook at a local boarding house, said she had been asking her employer to leave work early before it got dark. This followed an incident in which the Gown Man beat a man who didn't have any money nearly to death. A number of residents were barring their doors and remaining in their homes once evening fell. The Gown Man, however, met his match in a man named McCuir. The mugger cornered McCuir in a blind alley, pistol raised. But McCuir gave in to his instinct to run and plowed right through the Gown Man, knocking the criminal down and tromping him as he fled. Police and deputies, vowing to catch and unveil the disguised predator, responded to a call on July 17 but the Gown Man had vanished by the time they arrived.

The Baton Rouge Morning Advocate boldly declared on Aug. 5 that, ""While the 'Gown-Man' has grown to be a spectral figure of terror, still there isn't such a person."" Police had unraveled the sinister trail of the hooded ""hi-jacking terror"" and ""found there only a maze of hood-winking with a bit of supernatural fear thrown in."" Anxiety over the Gown Man persisted in Baton Rouge, with some young men courting serious legal trouble by carrying around guns for personal protection during their evening perambulations.

When the Gown Man first appeared in Baton Rouge, garbed in either women's pajamas or a short robe, some residents feared he might be Gabriel Talley, who was wanted years earlier in Iberville Parish for the brutal murder of a woman with a cane-knife. Son Talley, Gabriel's brother, was tried and sentenced to prison in Baton Rouge for a different killing. While on the lam, Gabriel had frequently visited relatives in Baton Rouge dressed as a woman to conceal his identity. Locals spotted him but were afraid to report his presence to police. But as more stories began to circulate and the stature of the desperado grew, he was said to be the ghost of a Baton Rouge police officer. ""Finally, he became just the 'Gown-Man'—the symbol of fear,"" wrote the Morning Advocate.

According to Deputy Sheriff Ed Whitney, who beat the streets of South Baton Rouge seeking an answer to the mystery, there was an actual basis to the now pervasive tales of the Gown Man. It had started with the mugger who had been trampled by one of his intended victims (McCuir) the previous month. Dressed in a short robe or raincoat with a dark hat pulled low over his eyes, this particular Gown Man had successfully robbed three local Black residents. But the man, who was also Black, had been arrested after robbing a white man and was by then confined to jail at Edgard, so he couldn't be the Gown Man still bedeviling Baton Rouge.

Whitney said it was possible that there had been additional hold-ups performed by other men dressed as the Gown Man. There was also a ""veritable maze"" of practical jokes. In one instance, a local resident hung a hat and old cloak on a coat hanger, attached it to a string, and ran the string over a telegraph pole and then to some bushes. When a group approached, the practical joker yanked on the string and the spectral figure arose, jostling around and startling the pedestrians before vanishing when the operator released the string. ""Those who saw the flapping figure told a harrowing story of fierce pursuit and narrow escape,"" it was reported. 

The Big Easy also had its own Gown Man, who aroused curiosity and fear during the last couple months of 1934. Walter Fervas was accosted while walking alone in downtown New Orleans around midnight. On the vague edge of light cast by infrequent lampposts, Fervas saw against a dark wall the form of a darker figure, tall but shapeless, its head a monstrous, angular shadow. It called out to Fervas, not in a ghostly croak but in a low, truculent voice. Fervas whirled around and ran, looking back to see the dark figure flapping in pursuit. The chased man careened across vacant lots, following a shortcut to his home on Touro Street, between Hope and Duels streets. Hearing the Gown Man curse behind him, Fervas plunged into his house, slammed the door shut and bolted it. ""Gownman,"" he told his frightened wife between panting, ""chased me all the way home.""

""He was a tall man, well over six feet,"" Fervas recalled. ""He was dressed in a long black gown that touched his feet, and he had on a black sunbonnet that shaded his face so you couldn't see it at all."" Fervas and his neighbors began observing 9 p.m. curfew on a long stretch centering about Annette Street, back of town and in town, and between Claiborne and Broad streets, as far in as Bourbon Street.

Some New Orleans residents said that Fervas got off easy, as they knew others who had been caught, robbed and beaten by the Gown Man. The fiend was said to lurk in the branches of sycamore trees that hung over a block of Bourbon Street near Dorgenois, diving down onto passersby ""like a snakebird dives under water,"" pinning his victim to the sidewalk. Neighbors recalled that the Gown Man had robbed a boy of $3.50 and then beat up another young man who didn't have any money. They said the Gown Man was not new to the neighborhood, having been seen for the previous two or three years, but only in winter. ""People run too fast when they are not tied up in overcoats,"" one resident suggested. 

[A 1934 illustration of the New Orleans Gown Man, published in the New Orleans Item-Tribune. Included here on a Fair Use, educational basis.](https://preview.redd.it/kv7vj5f89rje1.png?width=166&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd4d70ee526d9de4be2db16bff7439c6d683b78c)

The Gown Man was so prolific that New Orleans citizens assumed there must be more than one. He had been sighted in and outside town, in the Treme on Orleans Street, farther out than Broad, almost at the river, even uptown. Among the suspected Gown Men was ""Chicken Charley,” a violent neighborhood criminal, although police had no recent record of him. A ""notorious brigand"" nicknamed ""Stack of Dollars"" was another suspect. The Gown Men were thought to inhabit and change their regalia in a vacant building on Prieur Street, a former grocery. 

Marcel Fortune, who lived near the abandoned grocery, was walking past it at about 1:30 a.m. when he heard a voice call, ""Fortune!"" He looked down the dark alley next to the deserted building and saw a Black man standing there in the shadows. ""Where are you going?"" the stranger inquired. ""To work,"" answered Fortune. ""No, you're not,"" the stranger retorted. ""You're going to spend the night here with me."" Fortune noticed a rolled-up bundle of black cloth at the stranger's side, and the mystery man smiled evilly. ""I know you, but you don't know who I am,"" he said. ""You didn't know I was a gownman, did you? And there are three more in the alley."" Fortune then heard additional voices emanating from said alley. Just then, an older man came walking down the opposite sidewalk. Fortune called to him and ran across, the Gown Man shouting curses behind him but not following. Fortune decided not to report the incident to police out of fear that the Gown Men might retaliate. His older brother and a friend escorted him to his job at the Van Geffen Bakery moving forward. 

As real a threat as the Gown Man, or men, were to New Orleans residents, to police it was just a vague rumor that the African-American community had developed amongst itself. Citizens began discussing going out armed and in groups to bring an end to the Gown Man's terror. 

A marauder nicknamed ""The Black Phantom,"" ""The Skirt Man"" and ""Huggy Molly"" spread fear throughout the residential section of Montgomery, Alabama bordering the State Normal School (today Alabama State University) in August 1943. Police authenticated two attacks on young women in their rooms. The Black Phantom entered the home of a teacher and slapped his daughter before fleeing. He then did the same to the daughter of Rufus Williams, manager of the Nu Deal Taxi Company. Descriptions of the phantom varied, other than him being a Black man who was focusing his mischief on members of the African-American community. 

Huggy Molly eluded police and citizens for some time but by Aug. 11 had failed to appear for several days. Police suspected that a pursuing mob might have finally caught up to the Black Phantom and beaten him so severely that he was unable to continue his depredations. ""It was admitted, however, that however elusive the phantom might be, the excitement and fear engendered by his two known acts were still present and very real,"" reported the Montgomery Advertiser. On the night of Aug. 22, two men were trailing a masked man who suddenly turned around at the corner of Morgan and Stone streets and fired a pistol at them. Police, who scoured the neighborhood for several hours afterward unsuccessfully, did not believe their quarry was the much talked about Skirt Man.

The Gown Man was still active in New Orleans in 1945, at least within the rich traditions of the city's African-American denizens recorded by the Louisiana Writers Project. ""The Gown Man is tall and slim and wears a black cap and long black gown that reaches to the ground,"" said Olivia Collins, who resided at Camp Street near the levee of the Mississippi River. ""He has a long black automobile, I done seen it, parked down at the bottom of the levee."" Collins said that the Gown Man would approach women, but not if a man was around. She was uncertain of his race. ""I know one thing,"" Collins concluded. ""He's a real man, and not no ghost!"" Other residents, however., were certain that the Gown Man was a phantom, driving his long, shiny car around the neighborhood of the levee. When he showed up in other sections of the city, he would drop out of the trees and send women ""fleeing and screaming for their lives and virtues.""

The Gown Man bears a striking resemblance to the Woman in Black, another wraith of the witching hour that prowled city streets across the United States during the same era. While these wispy-thin ladies dressed head-to-toe in black mourning clothes were mostly spectral in nature, gliding along at inhuman speeds and dispersing suddenly into thin air—there was also a subset described as flesh-and-blood men in drag who accosted pedestrians. One such example was the Greenville Ghost, who bred hysteria throughout Jersey City, New Jersey in the winter of 1901-02. This ghost was more accurately described as a six-foot-tall, muscular man dressed in deep black women's clothing with a hat and heavy veil. He grabbed and sometimes hugged lone women, and on some occasions was reported to rough them up. Any man who tried to interfere found themselves knocked senseless by the Black Ghost. Armed groups of citizens, including children, patrolled the streets looking for the prowler. Police finally revealed that they had identified the ghost as a local man, who happened to be Black, and had a penchant for practical jokes. He was warned to cease his moonlight activities or face punishment. However, other reporting contradicted this identification, with police suggesting the whole story was either an exaggeration or a tall tale. I rehash this story to demonstrate how similar some of the Lady in Black stories were to the contemporaneous Gown Man. 

The Woman in Black appears to have frequently been a northeastern and midwestern U.S. phenomenon, occurring in communities that ranged greatly from diverse urban cities to rural coal-mining towns. It is possible that the Gown Man might represent a unique southern variation of the same theme, one which arose predominately in African-American communities. It appears that Hugging Molly as a name for this entity evolved into the Gown Man, as they occupied the same region and presented similar dress and behaviors. An 1894 article in the Daily Enquirer of Columbus, Georgia underlined the connection between the Woman in Black and Hugging Molly, writing, ""Have you seen the Lady in Black? She is a ghost-like apparition on the 'Hugging Molly' order, which flits around at night, but seems intangible. A mortal dread has fallen upon the community and many people are afraid to poke their heads outdoors after night. Who or what is the Lady in Black?"" In Part 2 of this series, we explored Abbeville, Alabama folk tales about Hugging Molly and the Woman in Black that might be connected.

In an early report dating back to October 1867, the gender of the Woman in Black was already in question. Citizens of Milan, Ohio proposed that the witching-hour phantom stalking their streets and evading capture—a six-foot-tall, heavily built figure garbed in a black dress—might actually be a man. 

As pointed out by author and folklorist Chris Woodyard in his excellent articles about the Woman in Black, these stories appear to reflect societal norms of the era which viewed cross-dressing as an aberration that was not to be trusted. It didn't seem to matter whether the ""Woman in Black"" was a thief masquerading in disguise or an innocent man who wished to express his sexual identity by appearing in public dressed in women's clothing, albeit safely obscured by a veil. Starting in the mid-1800s, more than 40 cities across the nation passed laws criminalizing cross-dressing. Gender inappropriateness or variance was viewed as an amoral sickness and a public offense.

Although this intolerant attitude is infrequently stated directly in stories about the Woman in Black, Hugging Molly and Gown Man, it clearly underpins the fear of these boogeymen that links the various cases. Aspersions, however, are coded in the use of the term ""Hugging Molly"" to refer to cross-dressing prowlers and muggers. In 18th century London, ""Molly"" was a slur used for effeminate, gay men, with ""Molly Houses"" describing ""the clubs, taverns, inns, or coffee houses where they met up in secret,"" according to the British Newspaper Archive. Homosexuality was punishable by law, with sentences ranging from standing in the pillory, to jail time, up to execution for sodomy, depending on the individual case and evidence. So, these venues offered a safe and private place for men to openly express their sexual identities and find acceptance, even though the ""Molly Houses"" were at constant risk of being raided by police. Interestingly, a member of the Folklore and Mythology subreddit named LeanBean512 recalled hearing the term ""Huggin' Molly"" used colloquially in Mississippi ""as a put down to describe a pathetic man, like a pervert or a flasher,"" so a pejorative use of the term appears to persist in the present day, possibly connected to the Hugging Molly legend.

Unlike the Woman in Black, the Gown Man was infrequently ascribed a supernatural nature. A corporeal man, sometimes an entire gang, was assumed to be masquerading in clothing of the opposite gender. The Gown Man was often feared as a robber, but like Hugging Molly before him, just as often engaged in mischief designed to scare, prank and stupefy his victims. Whatever his crimes, the Gown Man was viewed as a legitimate threat and a reason to dread walking alone at night. Residents reacted with outrage, and police appear to have taken the reports seriously. While some of the news articles might contain journalistic sensationalism, they seem to have documented a mix of truth and mass hysteria, likely perpetuating the latter. Some of the Gown Men were arrested, named and tried. Others just vanished into the void from which they came. Perhaps some criminals and pranksters were inspired by stories of Gown Men and dressed the part, or just took advantage of a concealing, obfuscating disguise, blending into the overall legend.

Another Woman in Black of an earthly nature forlornly wandered the streets of Louisville, Kentucky in October 1868, ringing doorbells late at night and then failing to acknowledge in any way the confused residents who answered. While not suggested to be a disguised man, the Louisville Courier-Journal wrote, ""She is very large, weighing two hundred pounds perhaps, which precludes the idea that she is a ghost or spirit. She is clad in black from head to foot; a black bonnet covering up her face in the ancient style; a black vail hanging over the bonnet; a black shawl; a black dress. At a distance she looks like a small-sized hearse.""

New Orleans did have its own Woman in Black for at least six months in 1869, somberly dressed as she strolled along the ""almost solitary desert"" of the levee from Luggars' Bay to the Morgan Steamship Landing. She promenaded like clockwork each night, appearing with the first shade of evening and vanishing before the first streak of daylight, even in inclement weather. The lady was tangible, distrustful police having arrested and brought her to the station at least a dozen times. She always gave police a different name, such as Virginia, Mary or just Madame. The woman was thought to be perennially vigilant for a friend she expected to arrive on a ship, one which was unfortunately destined never to reach port. The Woman in Black offered no objection when other pedestrians chose to accompany her through the labyrinth of boxes and bales along the pier, and responded to queries with education, intelligence and dignity. But at the first indication of day, she hastened off like a scared ghost. It is interesting to note that the New Orleans Woman in Black, like the Gown Man, was a strange living character rather than an outright phantasm.

Maybe it is just coincidence, but these masked and costumed nocturnal marauders like the Gown Man share some commonalities with fictional superheroes like The Shadow and Batman that became popular during the first half of the 20th century. While standing on the opposite side of justice, and preferring capes over dresses, such superheroes similarly catered to a public fascination with masked mystery men lurking on our city streets. 

But a more apt comparison is probably Candyman (memorably portrayed by Tony Todd), the serial killer of urban legend created by Clive Barker for the titular film series that began in 1992. In the films, Candyman emerges as a Bloody-Mary like specter of fear in the primarily African-American public housing project of Cabrini-Green Homes in Chicago. The Candyman myth is presented throughout the films as a community reaction to generations of racial injustice and the murders of innocent Black men. This includes Candyman himself, an African-American artist and son of a slave who was lynched in the late 1800s over his relationship with a white woman. Despite his origin, the feared Candyman kills residents of Cabrini-Green when needed to keep his legend alive. Although the Gown Man was a much less lethal character, could he have developed in a similar way to the fictional Candyman within African-American communities across the American South? 

Enigmatic phantom assailants have materialized throughout the centuries to frighten communities for a period of time and then vanish back into the shadows, a phenomenon explored by Robert E. Bartholomew and Paul Weatherhead in their excellent 2024 book, ""Social Panics & Phantom Attackers."" Fearsome fiends of this order have included Spring-Heeled Jack in 1830's England, phantom Zeppelins in 1909 New Zealand, the Mad Gasser of Mattoon, Illinois in 1944, and the 2001 Monkey Man scare in New Delhi, India. ""These sagas are powerful human creations that reflect prominent fears in society at any given time,"" wrote Bartholomew and Weatherhead. The authors argue that these outbreaks do not derive from any external bogeyman, but from human imagination fueled by our prevailing anxieties and deepest terrors. For example, the Mad Gasser coincided with widespread press speculation that the failing German military might resort to chemical weapon attacks on American cities during the waning months of World War 2. This existential fright was transposed into a local threat in which an unseen marauder was indiscriminately spraying poison gas into household windows across Mattoon. These mysterious assailants can evolve into urban myth and serve as cautionary tales, such as emphasizing the dangers to young women which lurk in a city's dark alleys at night.

Although each social panic has a unique context and the form of the aggressor varies, these is a discernible pattern that plays out across time and the world. According to Bartholomew and Weatherhead, a community will unconsciously create a scapegoat for their problems in the form of evil-doers, which unites them against a common enemy. Often, vigilante groups will form and patrol the streets, at times accusing innocent parties of being the mystery assailant. People, suddenly hyper-aware of their surroundings, begin seeing sinister threats all around them. Many residents will stay inside their homes, which impacts the local economy during the scare. Initially, authorities and the press add oxygen to the claims, investigating reports and taking them seriously. Due to the prevalence of incidents, they might assume there are multiple assailants operating in different areas. But after failing to find any supporting evidence, and encountering misidentifications and hoaxes, authorities and the same media that gave the claims credence begin to shed doubt on the whole phenomenon, even ridiculing sightings as flights of imagination. Further witnesses become hesitant to come forward, and the entire threat withers. 

Phantom assailants are not the territory of the weak-minded; everyone is susceptible to self-deception, our perception and memory highly prone to influence by external pressures. It is just part of the human condition. ""Our eyes do not simply reflect what is in our environment; our brains have a major influence on how we perceive the world and prime people to see what they expect to see,"" wrote Bartholomew and Weatherhead. As is evident in reviewing the multitude of cases explored in this series, the Gown Man, Hugging Molly and Woman in Black closely fit the patterns these authors identify in phantom assailants.

Hugging Molly and the Gown Man first appeared in the decades following emancipation, and the timing closely parallels the rise of the KKK. Did fears of the hate group and its disguised members (not to mention everyday racism) blend with similar tropes of ghostly ladies and enshrouded thieves from elsewhere in the country? If so, why were so many of the Gown Men unmasked to reveal they were Black men preying on their own communities? It suggests ever-present anxieties couched in the familiar, a menace that is close to home, material and frightening, yet also less dangerous, more vague and more controllable than an outside threat. The Woman in Black, Hugging Molly and the Gown Man all symbolize a general fear and warning of walking alone in the dark through urbanized areas. Yet the latter two entities appear to uniquely reflect the trauma of African-Americans who were establishing themselves as newly freed individuals in a South that had within living memory completely oppressed them.

**POSTSCRIPT:** I am writing this article as a 21st century white man and amateur folklorist who lives in the northeastern U.S. I am certainly open to hearing differing opinions and expertise from those with a more educated perspective on race relations in late 19th century/early 20th century America. I began writing this lengthy essay after stumbling upon a reference to the mysterious ""Gown Man"" in an article about the Monster of Marmotte Street. Once I realized it was a prolific character who appeared in news and lore from the American South over the course of several decades, I decided it was worth documenting and compiling an article on the phenomenon. My topmost goal is the preservation of American history and folklore that has mostly been forgotten, and to hopefully provide some valuable context about the era and place from which it originated. It would have been dishonest to ignore the fact that these stories center mostly on African-American communities in the American South during a time fraught with racial tension in the decades following the Civil War. Perhaps I am wrong about a visceral connection between the Gown Man and the KKK, although some contemporary articles also drew that comparison. In my opinion, the Gown Man/Hugging Molly is a unique piece of Southern folklore, likely connected to some real incidents, that is best remembered, understood and even celebrated for its uniqueness in the present day.

When I first started we had a few regular shoplifters who would come in and fill up an entire bag for life with food and then walk out, taking hundreds of pounds worth of stock at a time. This would happen about 6 times a week along with multiple other regulars who’d just take about £30-50 of stuff every day. We’ve had people jump over the till to take bottles of alcohol, people trying to break open our scratch card container, someone stealing our charity pot, someone who used to take about 8 bottles of wine every day, people jumping up and taking entire boxes from the overstock shelf, and people trying to get into the stock room. At one point our meat, coffee, chocolate boxes, laundry, and baby product shelves would all be cleared by shoplifters. Now we have to put every thing into security boxes or we’re only allowed to put out 2-3 high risk items. We eventually got security guards but they are essentially scare crows because they can’t restrain people, no idea if that’s law or a company policy. It has reduced a lot of regulars but not the more brazen ones. I can empathise with some shoplifters completely, but I didn’t expect nothing to be done about regular, brazen shoplifters taking probably about 1000 pounds worth of stuff a week.

“All Better Now”

The city stretched in all directions, its glass towers reflecting the dull grey of the overcast sky. It was a new beginning, or so they had said. A fresh start for a mother and daughter, moving from a place no one spoke about, leaving behind a man neither of them mentioned.

The girl’s name was Emily. She was small for her age, with dark circles under her wide, brown eyes, and hair that never quite seemed brushed. She rarely spoke at school, flinching when hands moved too quickly near her, staring down at her desk as if the numbers and words on the page could swallow her whole.

Her teacher, Ms. Lawson, noticed. She noticed the way Emily hesitated before answering questions, the way she recoiled from praise, as if the very idea of being noticed was dangerous. She noticed the bruises—small, fingerprint-like marks on her wrists, a shadow of something darker along her ribs when her shirt lifted as she reached for a book.

“Emily,” Ms. Lawson said one day, crouching beside her desk after class. “Are you okay, sweetheart?”

Emily stared at her, lips pressed together tightly.

“You can talk to me,” Ms. Lawson urged gently.

Something cracked behind Emily’s eyes then, like a dam giving way. Tears slipped down her cheeks.

“She hurts me,” Emily whispered.

Ms. Lawson’s heart clenched. “Who does, honey?”

Emily hesitated, then choked out the word.

“Mom.”

—-

The meeting with the mother was arranged quickly.

Ms. Lawson sat in the principal’s office, a cup of untouched coffee growing cold in her hands. Emily sat beside her, knees drawn up under the too-big sweater she always wore.

And then her mother arrived.

She was a beautiful woman—poised, elegant, with a controlled kind of grace. She looked at Emily, then at Ms. Lawson, and gave a small, warm smile.

“I don’t know what she’s told you,” she said, “but my Emily… she has a very active imagination.”

“She said you hurt her,” Ms. Lawson said carefully.

The mother’s smile never wavered. Instead, she turned to Emily.

“Oh, sweetheart,” she murmured, brushing a gentle hand down the girl’s hair. Emily flinched, but her mother’s grip was deceptively firm. “You must be sick like your father.”

Emily froze. The world seemed to shrink around her, the fluorescent lights of the office humming too loudly.

The conversation went in circles after that. The mother was charming, calm, reasonable. She spoke about stress, how Emily had struggled with the move, how her father—“He had his issues, you see”—had left a mark on the poor girl.

And in the end, the adults nodded. They reassured the mother, patted Emily’s trembling hands, and sent them home together.

—-

The first visit to the psychiatrist came a week later.

Emily sat in a too-cold office as a man with tired eyes asked her questions. She tried to answer truthfully, but her mother was right there, her presence looming beside her.

The diagnosis came quickly: Early-onset psychosis. Delusions. Possible inherited disorder.

The medication followed. It made her feel slow and heavy, like she was swimming through fog.

The second visit led to stronger drugs.

The third, to a recommendation for electroconvulsive therapy.

And by then, Emily had stopped struggling.

—-


The years blurred together.

Emily barely remembered school. The social worker visits came and went, but her mother always had an answer.

“She says strange things,” her mother would say, voice tinged with just the right amount of sadness. “She still has episodes. I love her so much, I just want her to be okay.”

And the social workers would nod.

The police, when she tried to tell them, would glance at her records and sigh. “Your mother is taking care of you,” they said.

And Emily would go home.

Back to the sessions, back to the pills, back to the wires and the white room, where they fastened cold metal to her temples and told her it was for her own good.

She was seventeen the last time she tried to run.

The city streets were wet with rain, the neon lights reflecting off the pavement as she stumbled through the alleys, her mind sluggish from the cocktail of drugs weighing her down.

She made it to the police station, but the moment they pulled up her file, she knew.

“Your mother has been worried sick,” they said.

And then she was home again.

—-

The living room was warm and cozy, the way it had always been. Soft light bathed the walls, and a candle flickered on the table. The only sound was the soft scritch, scritch of crayons on paper.

Emily sat at the dining table, humming tunelessly, a smile plastered across her face as she colored. Her movements were slow, stiff—mechanical, like an old wind-up doll that hadn’t been wound up quite right.

Her picture was an explosion of colors. Bright red, slashed angrily across the page. Black, in thick, heavy strokes. A face, distorted and smudged, its mouth stretched too wide, its eyes hollow.

Her fingers shook as she clutched a yellow crayon too tightly, pressing it into the paper until it snapped. She blinked down at the broken piece in her palm, confused for a long moment, before dropping it like it was something foreign.

The air shifted behind her.

Her mother.

She moved closer, her presence like a shadow that never quite left. She placed gentle hands on Emily’s shoulders, squeezing lightly, almost lovingly.

Emily didn’t look up.

She kept coloring, kept humming.

“Such a pretty picture, sweetheart,” her mother murmured, voice dripping with warmth. She leaned down, her lips brushing Emily’s ear.

“I love you.”

Emily’s crayon dragged off the page. She lifted her head slowly, eyes unfocused, her mouth working soundlessly before she finally murmured, in a voice cracked and empty:

“… Mummy?”

Her mother’s smile was radiant, a perfect, beautiful thing.

She kissed Emily’s temple, smoothing down her tangled hair like she had when she was small.

“There,” she whispered.

“All better now.”

My own mother gaslit, blackmailed and manipulated me into all sorts of drugs and even electroshock then I successfully attempted suicide but then was revived, all for conditions I never had - I had a substance induced brain injury plus PSSD from the Zoloft she had forced on me years earlier, she ignored this and came up with dozens of extreme psych conditions and ran me through the system. I am ashamed I let myself be manipulated and now have to seek MAID (euthanasia) as well as a care home as my brain injury is now so much worse I can’t work or care for myself at just 32. I never had any mental health issues at all, ever. 

This is a warning that these narcissistic parents can ruin your lives and health.",1,1739822261.0,narcissisticparents,0,1.0,False

We've previously covered Mobile, Alabama's decades-long haunting by the Gown Man, and the similar Hugging Mollies who preceded him on a grander scale. Today we delve into the Gown Man's career as it spread further across the American South, the possible meaning behind the legend, and similarities with the prolific Woman in Black phantom.

In mid-July 1920, a Gown Man frequented the neighborhood of Bradford Street, between Reynoir and Lameuse streets, in Biloxi, Mississippi. On dark nights, he roamed the local Jewish cemetery and the larger cemetery north of Reynoir Street. There had been a similar specter spotted months earlier near Crawford Street and then Lee Street, but it was unclear if this was the same Gown Man. Residents chased this latest Gown Man and were unable to catch him. Biloxi Chief of Police Bills learned of the matter and tasked Officer Michel to search for the costumed interloper. The Gown Man was spotted the night of Aug. 6 in a yard on East Washington Street. Residents, armed with pistols and shotguns, started out in search of the alleged man dressed in women's clothing. When the posse finally crossed paths with the Gown Man, they fired at least 15 shots. When the smoke cleared, the stranger was gone. The next morning, the searchers returned but found only the sheered tops of small pine trees and bushes they had blasted away with their bullets. Chief Bills soon after said he believed that imagination had much to do with the sightings of the Gown Man in various sections of Biloxi, terror spreading in whichever area he suddenly appeared. Police responded to a reported Gown Man sighting near Lee Street on Aug. 17, but found it was just a harmless old woman. She was dressed in a dark shirt with a white waist and an apron that made it appear she was wearing trousers under her dress. A similar report of a Gown Man during April 1914 in Tampa, Florida turned out to be an elderly man in a hospital gown who had escaped a local hospital.

On Feb. 11, 1921, Baton Rouge Police Captain Comeaux and Frank Schoonmaker completed a thorough search of South Baton Rouge for the Gown Man who was reported to be holding up Black residents on the lower end of town and committing various robberies. The thief wore a white bonnet and a long, flowing white gown. He was said to creep stealthily through South Baton Rouge, sticking up victims in dark alleys. ""Captain Comeaux states that the reports have been very much exaggerated,"" wrote the Baton Rogue State Times Advocate. ""After a three-day search and after questioning practically everybody in the neighborhood where the 'gown man' operates, it was found that no one has been held up, \[and\] no one knows of anyone else who has been robbed by the mysterious man."" This Gown Man, concluded the police, was merely a rumor fueled by excitement. Despite this conclusion, the Gown Man would return to Baton Rouge.

https://preview.redd.it/i372zqum7rje1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=23e7e4ebcc01feb56f95bbf356959fc914e490b2

Around 1930, a character known as the ""Domino Man"" struck the sparsely inhabited Gentilly suburb of New Orleans. Development had barely begun, so there were numerous empty lots that were thickly wooded and overgrown with tall weeds. The Domino Man, dressed in a white robe and hood, waited in the trees and dropped down into the lanes to chase little girls who were on their way to school, gesticulating wildly. After frightening the children, he would leap back into the trees with ""the agility of a monkey"" and vanish. Since the kids were always too frantic afterward to be certain of his size, a theory emerged that the Domino Man was actually a monkey that someone had dressed up as a practical joke. All witnesses swore the Domino Man never attacked or followed the children very far, content to depart once they screamed and ran. Armed men had pursued the Domino Man and fired directly at him, certain their bullets had hit their target, only for the troublemaker to reappear the next day, unharmed. Some locals concluded that since most of the kids were Catholics, the Domino Man might be a Ku Klux Klan member. The KKK rode a nativist wave of Anti-Catholicism during the 1920s, holding that Catholicism conflicted with democracy. They also believed that parochial schools encouraged separatism which kept young Catholics from growing into loyal Americans. So, apparently their way to solve that issue was by leaping at children from trees?

In July 1934, the Gown Man targeted and robbed several African-American citizens on the southern outskirts of Baton Rouge. The Morning Advocate described him as ""a very real bogey man"" who dressed in ""an appallingly long black gown"" underneath which he carried a big pistol. Witnesses described the Gown Man as ""tall and fierce."" He robbed a pedestrian of his cash on July 10, then went on a spree the next night, stealing five cents from one victim and $4.85 from another before frightening an elderly man ""almost into fits."" A woman named Annabelle, a cook at a local boarding house, said she had been asking her employer to leave work early before it got dark. This followed an incident in which the Gown Man beat a man who didn't have any money nearly to death. A number of residents were barring their doors and remaining in their homes once evening fell. The Gown Man, however, met his match in a man named McCuir. The mugger cornered McCuir in a blind alley, pistol raised. But McCuir gave in to his instinct to run and plowed right through the Gown Man, knocking the criminal down and tromping him as he fled. Police and deputies, vowing to catch and unveil the disguised predator, responded to a call on July 17 but the Gown Man had vanished by the time they arrived.

The Baton Rouge Morning Advocate boldly declared on Aug. 5 that, ""While the 'Gown-Man' has grown to be a spectral figure of terror, still there isn't such a person."" Police had unraveled the sinister trail of the hooded ""hi-jacking terror"" and ""found there only a maze of hood-winking with a bit of supernatural fear thrown in."" Anxiety over the Gown Man persisted in Baton Rouge, with some young men courting serious legal trouble by carrying around guns for personal protection during their evening perambulations.

When the Gown Man first appeared in Baton Rouge, garbed in either women's pajamas or a short robe, some residents feared he might be Gabriel Talley, who was wanted years earlier in Iberville Parish for the brutal murder of a woman with a cane-knife. Son Talley, Gabriel's brother, was tried and sentenced to prison in Baton Rouge for a different killing. While on the lam, Gabriel had frequently visited relatives in Baton Rouge dressed as a woman to conceal his identity. Locals spotted him but were afraid to report his presence to police. But as more stories began to circulate and the stature of the desperado grew, he was said to be the ghost of a Baton Rouge police officer. ""Finally, he became just the 'Gown-Man'—the symbol of fear,"" wrote the Morning Advocate.

According to Deputy Sheriff Ed Whitney, who beat the streets of South Baton Rouge seeking an answer to the mystery, there was an actual basis to the now pervasive tales of the Gown Man. It had started with the mugger who had been trampled by one of his intended victims (McCuir) the previous month. Dressed in a short robe or raincoat with a dark hat pulled low over his eyes, this particular Gown Man had successfully robbed three local Black residents. But the man, who was also Black, had been arrested after robbing a white man and was by then confined to jail at Edgard, so he couldn't be the Gown Man still bedeviling Baton Rouge.

Whitney said it was possible that there had been additional hold-ups performed by other men dressed as the Gown Man. There was also a ""veritable maze"" of practical jokes. In one instance, a local resident hung a hat and old cloak on a coat hanger, attached it to a string, and ran the string over a telegraph pole and then to some bushes. When a group approached, the practical joker yanked on the string and the spectral figure arose, jostling around and startling the pedestrians before vanishing when the operator released the string. ""Those who saw the flapping figure told a harrowing story of fierce pursuit and narrow escape,"" it was reported. 

The Big Easy also had its own Gown Man, who aroused curiosity and fear during the last couple months of 1934. Walter Fervas was accosted while walking alone in downtown New Orleans around midnight. On the vague edge of light cast by infrequent lampposts, Fervas saw against a dark wall the form of a darker figure, tall but shapeless, its head a monstrous, angular shadow. It called out to Fervas, not in a ghostly croak but in a low, truculent voice. Fervas whirled around and ran, looking back to see the dark figure flapping in pursuit. The chased man careened across vacant lots, following a shortcut to his home on Touro Street, between Hope and Duels streets. Hearing the Gown Man curse behind him, Fervas plunged into his house, slammed the door shut and bolted it. ""Gownman,"" he told his frightened wife between panting, ""chased me all the way home.""

""He was a tall man, well over six feet,"" Fervas recalled. ""He was dressed in a long black gown that touched his feet, and he had on a black sunbonnet that shaded his face so you couldn't see it at all."" Fervas and his neighbors began observing 9 p.m. curfew on a long stretch centering about Annette Street, back of town and in town, and between Claiborne and Broad streets, as far in as Bourbon Street.

Some New Orleans residents said that Fervas got off easy, as they knew others who had been caught, robbed and beaten by the Gown Man. The fiend was said to lurk in the branches of sycamore trees that hung over a block of Bourbon Street near Dorgenois, diving down onto passersby ""like a snakebird dives under water,"" pinning his victim to the sidewalk. Neighbors recalled that the Gown Man had robbed a boy of $3.50 and then beat up another young man who didn't have any money. They said the Gown Man was not new to the neighborhood, having been seen for the previous two or three years, but only in winter. ""People run too fast when they are not tied up in overcoats,"" one resident suggested. 

[A 1934 illustration of the New Orleans Gown Man, published in the New Orleans Item-Tribune. Included here on a Fair Use, educational basis.](https://preview.redd.it/sv45bmbq7rje1.png?width=166&format=png&auto=webp&s=4629045f92c73dfb758c78a63e84eebca22b2c60)

The Gown Man was so prolific that New Orleans citizens assumed there must be more than one. He had been sighted in and outside town, in the Treme on Orleans Street, farther out than Broad, almost at the river, even uptown. Among the suspected Gown Men was ""Chicken Charley,” a violent neighborhood criminal, although police had no recent record of him. A ""notorious brigand"" nicknamed ""Stack of Dollars"" was another suspect. The Gown Men were thought to inhabit and change their regalia in a vacant building on Prieur Street, a former grocery. 

Marcel Fortune, who lived near the abandoned grocery, was walking past it at about 1:30 a.m. when he heard a voice call, ""Fortune!"" He looked down the dark alley next to the deserted building and saw a Black man standing there in the shadows. ""Where are you going?"" the stranger inquired. ""To work,"" answered Fortune. ""No, you're not,"" the stranger retorted. ""You're going to spend the night here with me."" Fortune noticed a rolled-up bundle of black cloth at the stranger's side, and the mystery man smiled evilly. ""I know you, but you don't know who I am,"" he said. ""You didn't know I was a gownman, did you? And there are three more in the alley."" Fortune then heard additional voices emanating from said alley. Just then, an older man came walking down the opposite sidewalk. Fortune called to him and ran across, the Gown Man shouting curses behind him but not following. Fortune decided not to report the incident to police out of fear that the Gown Men might retaliate. His older brother and a friend escorted him to his job at the Van Geffen Bakery moving forward. 

As real a threat as the Gown Man, or men, were to New Orleans residents, to police it was just a vague rumor that the African-American community had developed amongst itself. Citizens began discussing going out armed and in groups to bring an end to the Gown Man's terror. 

A marauder nicknamed ""The Black Phantom,"" ""The Skirt Man"" and ""Huggy Molly"" spread fear throughout the residential section of Montgomery, Alabama bordering the State Normal School (today Alabama State University) in August 1943. Police authenticated two attacks on young women in their rooms. The Black Phantom entered the home of a teacher and slapped his daughter before fleeing. He then did the same to the daughter of Rufus Williams, manager of the Nu Deal Taxi Company. Descriptions of the phantom varied, other than him being a Black man who was focusing his mischief on members of the African-American community. 

Huggy Molly eluded police and citizens for some time but by Aug. 11 had failed to appear for several days. Police suspected that a pursuing mob might have finally caught up to the Black Phantom and beaten him so severely that he was unable to continue his depredations. ""It was admitted, however, that however elusive the phantom might be, the excitement and fear engendered by his two known acts were still present and very real,"" reported the Montgomery Advertiser. On the night of Aug. 22, two men were trailing a masked man who suddenly turned around at the corner of Morgan and Stone streets and fired a pistol at them. Police, who scoured the neighborhood for several hours afterward unsuccessfully, did not believe their quarry was the much talked about Skirt Man.

The Gown Man was still active in New Orleans in 1945, at least within the rich traditions of the city's African-American denizens recorded by the Louisiana Writers Project. ""The Gown Man is tall and slim and wears a black cap and long black gown that reaches to the ground,"" said Olivia Collins, who resided at Camp Street near the levee of the Mississippi River. ""He has a long black automobile, I done seen it, parked down at the bottom of the levee."" Collins said that the Gown Man would approach women, but not if a man was around. She was uncertain of his race. ""I know one thing,"" Collins concluded. ""He's a real man, and not no ghost!"" Other residents, however., were certain that the Gown Man was a phantom, driving his long, shiny car around the neighborhood of the levee. When he showed up in other sections of the city, he would drop out of the trees and send women ""fleeing and screaming for their lives and virtues.""

The Gown Man bears a striking resemblance to the Woman in Black, another wraith of the witching hour that prowled city streets across the United States during the same era. While these wispy-thin ladies dressed head-to-toe in black mourning wear were mostly spectral in nature, gliding along at inhuman speeds and dispersing suddenly into thin air—there was also a subset described as flesh-and-blood men in drag who accosted pedestrians. One such example was the Greenville Ghost, who bred hysteria throughout Jersey City, New Jersey in the winter of 1901-02. This ghost was more accurately described as a six-foot-tall, muscular man dressed in deep black women's clothing with a hat and heavy veil. He grabbed and sometimes hugged lone women, and on some occasions was reported to rough them up. Any man who tried to interfere found themselves knocked senseless by the Black Ghost. Armed groups of citizens, including children, patrolled the streets looking for the prowler. Police finally revealed that they had identified the ghost as a local man, who happened to be Black, and had a penchant for practical jokes. He was warned to cease his moonlight activities or face punishment. However, other reporting contradicted this identification, with police suggesting the whole story was either an exaggeration or a tall tale. I rehash this story to demonstrate how similar some of the Lady in Black stories were to the contemporaneous Gown Man. 

The Woman in Black appears to have frequently been a northeastern and midwestern U.S. phenomenon, occurring in communities that ranged greatly from diverse urban cities to rural coal-mining towns. It is possible that the Gown Man might represent a unique southern variation of the same theme, one which arose predominately in African-American communities. It appears that Hugging Molly as a name for this entity evolved into the Gown Man, as they occupied the same region and presented similar dress and behaviors. An 1894 article in the Daily Enquirer of Columbus, Georgia underlined the connection between the Woman in Black and Hugging Molly, writing, ""Have you seen the Lady in Black? She is a ghost-like apparition on the 'Hugging Molly' order, which flits around at night, but seems intangible. A mortal dread has fallen upon the community and many people are afraid to poke their heads outdoors after night. Who or what is the Lady in Black?"" In Part 2 of this series, we explored Abbeville, Alabama folk tales about Hugging Molly and the Woman in Black that might be connected.

In an early report dating back to October 1867, the gender of the Woman in Black was already in question. Citizens of Milan, Ohio proposed that the witching-hour phantom stalking their streets and evading capture—a six-foot-tall, heavily built figure garbed in a black dress—might actually be a man. 

As pointed out by author and folklorist Chris Woodyard in his excellent articles about the Woman in Black, these stories appear to reflect societal norms of the era which viewed cross-dressing as an aberration that was not to be trusted. It didn't seem to matter whether the ""Woman in Black"" was a thief masquerading in disguise or an innocent man who wished to express his sexual identity by appearing in public dressed in women's clothing, albeit safely obscured by a veil. Starting in the mid-1800s, more than 40 cities across the nation passed laws criminalizing cross-dressing. Gender inappropriateness or variance was viewed as an amoral sickness and a public offense.

Although this intolerant attitude is infrequently stated directly in stories about the Woman in Black, Hugging Molly and Gown Man, it clearly underpins the fear of these boogeymen that links the various cases. Aspersions, however, are coded in the use of the term ""Hugging Molly"" to refer to cross-dressing prowlers and muggers. In 18th century London, ""Molly"" was a slur used for effeminate, gay men, with ""Molly Houses"" describing ""the clubs, taverns, inns, or coffee houses where they met up in secret,"" according to the British Newspaper Archive. Homosexuality was punishable by law, with sentences ranging from standing in the pillory, to jail time, up to execution for sodomy, depending on the individual case and evidence. So, these venues offered a safe and private place for men to openly express their sexual identities and find acceptance, even though the ""Molly Houses"" were at constant risk of being raided by police. Interestingly, a member of the Folklore and Mythology subreddit named LeanBean512 recalled hearing the term ""Huggin' Molly"" used colloquially in Mississippi ""as a put down to describe a pathetic man, like a pervert or a flasher,"" so a pejorative use of the term appears to persist in the present day, possibly connected to the Hugging Molly legend.

Unlike the Woman in Black, the Gown Man was infrequently ascribed a supernatural nature. A corporeal man, sometimes an entire gang, was assumed to be masquerading in clothing of the opposite gender. The Gown Man was often feared as a robber, but like Hugging Molly before him, just as often engaged in mischief designed to scare, prank and stupefy his victims. Whatever his crimes, the Gown Man was viewed as a legitimate threat and a reason to dread walking alone at night. Residents reacted with outrage, and police appear to have taken the reports seriously. While some of the news articles might contain journalistic sensationalism, they seem to have documented a mix of truth and mass hysteria, likely perpetuating the latter. Some of the Gown Men were arrested, named and tried. Others just vanished into the void from which they came. Perhaps some criminals and pranksters were inspired by stories of Gown Men and dressed the part, or just took advantage of a concealing, obfuscating disguise, blending into the overall legend.

Another Woman in Black of an earthly nature forlornly wandered the streets of Louisville, Kentucky in October 1868, ringing doorbells late at night and then failing to acknowledge in any way the confused residents who answered. While not suggested to be a disguised man, the Louisville Courier-Journal wrote, ""She is very large, weighing two hundred pounds perhaps, which precludes the idea that she is a ghost or spirit. She is clad in black from head to foot; a black bonnet covering up her face in the ancient style; a black vail hanging over the bonnet; a black shawl; a black dress. At a distance she looks like a small-sized hearse.""

New Orleans did have its own Woman in Black for at least six months in 1869, somberly dressed as she strolled along the ""almost solitary desert"" of the levee from Luggars' Bay to the Morgan Steamship Landing. She promenaded like clockwork each night, appearing with the first shade of evening and vanishing before the first streak of daylight, even in inclement weather. The lady was tangible, distrustful police having arrested and brought her to the station at least a dozen times. She always gave police a different name, such as Virginia, Mary or just Madame. The woman was thought to be perennially vigilant for a friend she expected to arrive on a ship, one which was unfortunately destined never to reach port. The Woman in Black offered no objection when other pedestrians chose to accompany her through the labyrinth of boxes and bales along the pier, and responded to queries with education, intelligence and dignity. But at the first indication of day, she hastened off like a scared ghost. It is interesting to note that the New Orleans Woman in Black, like the Gown Man, was a strange living character rather than an outright phantasm.

Maybe it is just coincidence, but these masked and costumed nocturnal marauders like the Gown Man share some commonalities with fictional superheroes like The Shadow and Batman that became popular during the first half of the 20th century. While standing on the opposite side of justice, and preferring capes over dresses, such superheroes similarly catered to a public fascination with masked mystery men lurking on our city streets. 

But a more apt comparison is probably Candyman (memorably portrayed by Tony Todd), the serial killer of urban legend created by Clive Barker for the titular film series that began in 1992. In the films, Candyman emerges as a Bloody-Mary like specter of fear in the primarily African-American public housing project of Cabrini-Green Homes in Chicago. The Candyman myth is presented throughout the films as a community reaction to generations of racial injustice and the murders of innocent Black men. This includes Candyman himself, an African-American artist and son of a slave who was lynched in the late 1800s over his relationship with a white woman. Despite his origin, the feared Candyman kills residents of Cabrini-Green when needed to keep his legend alive. Although the Gown Man was a much less lethal character, could he have developed in a similar way to the fictional Candyman within African-American communities across the American South? 

Enigmatic phantom assailants have materialized throughout the centuries to frighten communities for a period of time and then vanish back into the shadows, a phenomenon explored by Robert E. Bartholomew and Paul Weatherhead in their excellent book, ""Social Panics & Phantom Attackers."" Fearsome fiends of this order have included Spring-Heeled Jack in 1830's England, phantom Zeppelins in 1909 New Zealand, the Mad Gasser of Mattoon, Illinois in 1944, and the 2001 Monkey Man scare in New Delhi, India. ""These sagas are powerful human creations that reflect prominent fears in society at any given time,"" wrote Bartholomew and Weatherhead. The authors argue that these outbreaks do not derive from any external bogeyman, but from human imagination fueled by our prevailing anxieties and deepest terrors. For example, the Mad Gasser coincided with widespread press speculation that the failing German military might resort to chemical weapon attacks on American cities during the waning months of World War 2. This existential fright was transposed into a local threat in which an unseen marauder was indiscriminately spraying poison gas into household windows across Mattoon. These mysterious assailants can evolve into urban myth and serve as cautionary tales, such as emphasizing the dangers to young women which lurk in a city's dark alleys at night.

Although each social panic has a unique context and the form of the aggressor varies, these is a discernible pattern that plays out across time and the world. According to Bartholomew and Weatherhead, a community will unconsciously create a scapegoat for their problems in the form of evil-doers, which unites them against a common enemy. Often, vigilante groups will form and patrol the streets, at times accusing innocent parties of being the mystery assailant. People, suddenly hyper-aware of their surroundings, begin seeing sinister threats all around them. Many residents will stay inside their homes, which impacts the local economy during the scare. Initially, authorities and the press add oxygen to the claims, investigating reports and taking them seriously. Due to the prevalence of incidents, they might assume there are multiple assailants operating in different areas. But after failing to find any supporting evidence, and encountering misidentifications and hoaxes, authorities and the same media that gave the claims credence begin to shed doubt on the whole phenomenon, even ridiculing sightings as flights of imagination. Further witnesses become hesitant to come forward, and the entire threat withers. 

Phantom assailants are not the territory of the weak-minded; everyone is susceptible to self-deception, our perception and memory highly prone to influence by external pressures. It is just part of the human condition. ""Our eyes do not simply reflect what is in our environment; our brains have a major influence on how we perceive the world and prime people to see what they expect to see,"" wrote Bartholomew and Weatherhead. As is evident in reviewing the multitude of cases explored in this series, the Gown Man, Hugging Molly and Woman in Black closely fit the patterns these authors identify in phantom assailants.

Hugging Molly and the Gown Man first appeared in the decades following emancipation, and the timing closely parallels the rise of the KKK. Did fears of the hate group and its disguised members (not to mention everyday racism) blend with similar tropes of ghostly ladies and enshrouded thieves from elsewhere in the country? If so, why were so many of the Gown Men unmasked to reveal they were Black men preying on their own communities? It suggests ever-present anxieties couched in the familiar, a menace that is close to home, material and frightening, yet also less dangerous, more vague and more controllable than an outside threat. The Woman in Black, Hugging Molly and the Gown Man all symbolize a general fear and warning of walking alone in the dark through urbanized areas. Yet the latter two entities appear to uniquely reflect the trauma of African-Americans who were establishing themselves as newly freed individuals in a South that had within living memory completely oppressed them.

**POSTSCRIPT:** I am writing this article as a 21st century white man and amateur folklorist who lives in the northeastern U.S. I am certainly open to hearing differing opinions and expertise from those with a more educated perspective on race relations in late 19th century/early 20th century America. I began writing this lengthy essay after stumbling upon a reference to the mysterious ""Gown Man"" in an article about the Monster of Marmotte Street. Once I realized it was a prolific character who appeared in news and lore from the American South over the course of several decades, I decided it was worth documenting and compiling an article on the phenomenon. My topmost goal is the preservation of American history and folklore that has mostly been forgotten, and to hopefully provide some valuable context about the era and place from which it originated. It would have been dishonest to ignore the fact that these stories center mostly on African-American communities in the American South during a time fraught with racial tension in the decades following the Civil War. Perhaps I am wrong about a visceral connection between the Gown Man and the KKK, although some contemporary articles also drew that comparison. In my opinion, the Gown Man/Hugging Molly is a unique piece of Southern folklore, likely connected to some real incidents, that is best remembered, understood and even celebrated for its uniqueness in the present day.

1irsv07,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1irsv07/why_most_people_fail_to_change_their_reality_and/,Why Most People Fail to Change Their Reality (And How to Finally Control It),"Let’s get real for a second.

Most people in the manifestation and Law of Attraction space are only manifesting small things - angel numbers, free coffees, or random text messages. But when it comes to the big stuff - money, relationships, or life-changing shifts - they hit a wall.

Or they get stuck in the 'wanting' state, unable to escape it.

Why?

Because they’re missing the *real* reason that keeps them stuck.

They’re out here doing affirmations, vision boards, and “raising their vibration,” thinking it’s going to magically change their lives. But here’s the hard truth: **Your subconscious doesn’t care what you “want.” It only lets you have what it believes is safe.**

And that’s where 99% of people go wrong.

Here’s the hard truth: **You’re not failing at manifestation. You’re failing to address the barrier, preventing manifestation.**

**‎**

# How I Went From Broke and Broken to Living My Dream Life

I’m not here to sell you fairy tales. I’ve been where you are.

For 7 *years*, I struggled to manifest anything meaningful. I was broke 7k in debt (half to my ex girlfriend)... my relationship was falling apart right in front of my eyes and I couldn't control my feelings of jealousy and comparison... and I was trying to launch a fitness business for years, jumping from one course or book to another, without making a dime more... or seeing any results.

I tried affirmations, looking in the eye in the mirror, hypnotherapy, did Tony Robins, Brian Tracy, 5-second rule, and every manifestation technique possible. Nothing changed.

Until after breakup I felt like I lost it all. And I dug deep to find out the real problem.

That's when I realized: **I wasn’t stuck because I was “manifesting wrong” — I was stuck because my subconscious beliefs weren’t letting me have the life I wanted.**

That night, accidentally, I developed a method that addresses the very obstacle... transforms subconscious beliefs - and changes thoughts, emotions and behaviors naturally. And here’s what happened:

* I went from **daily social anxiety** → to **ever-lasting confidence, everywhere I go.** (over 10 years now, it has never diminished one bit)
* From **7 years of failure** → to building **multiple successful businesses.** (I average 2k/day, often 5-10k for a single 45 minute consultation)
* From **no money & struggling** → to making more than I ever imagined—**without even working for it.**
* From having **strong fear of rejection (difficulty dating)** → to being able to **effortlessly approach any 10/10 girl and it goes well every time.**
* From **having jealousy and insecurity** in relationship, to **having zero fears, or worries of relationship failing or being left**.
* From strong fear of rejection and approach anxiety to being able to **confidently approach most gorgeous people**, and have it work out well - every time.

And it didn't just work for me. The method I'm about to reveal to you, I tested with hundreds of people, and it worked every. Single. Time.

Because the method I discovered is composed of 3 scientific principles, proven to work all of the time - in everyone. They're always working, even this minute in everyone's lives.

But all of these transformations, singlehandedly, came down to one thing: **rewiring subconscious beliefs to be in full alignment with the life you want.**

*\*I don't have much time. But I decided to come write this post, and share this method, because I know what it's like to believe and hope and not be able to be or have what you want. After being sick, this was my biggest desire. To finally be normal, like everyone else. And i couldn't. This was the only thing, that gave me confidence, success and freedom for the rest of my life. So this is especially for people, who I see in the posts need this most.*

# The Real Problem: How Limiting Beliefs Are Running the Show

Let’s get one thing straight: **Your subconscious mind doesn’t care about your goals and dreams.** 

It cares about **keeping you safe**. First and foremost our brain is a survival mechanism, designed to watch the news and find out the potential danger or the bad thing that can happen.

This is KEY fact most people don't know:  *Your brain can’t distinguish between potential* ***physical danger*** *and potential* ***emotional danger.***

If your desires have even the slightest *potential* of emotional danger (rejection, failure etc.) and feel even remotely threatening, your subconscious will block out all the information that would help you GET THERE and instead mental blocks, negative thoughts and emotions - sabotaging you every. Single. Time.

Think about it:

* **You can want 1 million dollars -** but if that means there's a potential to *‘be rejected by your close friends’, ‘judged by others’, or ‘appear bad... or greedy in the eyes of others’* \- the mind knows that, and it will block all possible information, that would help you get there and make that 1 million.
* **You can want your ex back -** but your subconscious can see the potential of being left and abandoned again... betrayed... and the pain of being alone being on the other side... so it creates fear and invisible barrier, to prevent you from sending that message - creating conflict from what you want - and how you actually feel.

Every one of these fears and limiting beliefs are rooted in your **past experiences (memory).**

Your brain isn’t sabotaging you. It’s protecting you.

Your subconscious is designed to keep you in alignment with what feels “safe.” And if you haven’t rewritten your limiting beliefs, it will filter out any opportunities, ideas, or actions that would bring you the things you want.

This is why people “try everything” and nothing works. They are focusing on the things outside, without seeing how their inside - beliefs - are creating their thoughts, emotions, behaviors, intentions, words and actions = *all manifesting energies, attracting their corresponding reality.*

**All these fears and limiting beliefs don’t come out of nowhere.** They’re rooted in our childhood.

‎

# How Our Childhood Creates Limiting Beliefs

Here’s the kicker: **Your current reality is a reflection of your past beliefs and memories.** Pre-determining your future experiences **- Fate.**

And for most people, they are entirely invisible. Because most methods, approaches, gurus or even therapists often focus on the *'outside work'.*

The problem is these beliefs are **inside**. They're about internal experiences.

Let’s break it down:

* **Shame:** That time your parents give love to your sibling or a neighbor kid, and by comparison you feel that if you are worse than others or not good enough = you might not get love... or even worse - you can be the one who gets left and can't survive...
* **Guilt:** Remember those times your parents punished you for doing something bad? Remember what happened when you got a BAD grade? Remember how society and movies show you what happens if you are BAD? And often... people with money = are 'bad'..
* **Fear of Rejection:** Remember how it feels, when you cry and your parents got upset at you. Simply for being - the way you are? And when the first time it was hard to make friends and somebody excluded you? Or that if you don't match expectations, they will turn on you?
* **Fear of Failure:** What about our parents expectations? What happened if we failed to meet them? Didn't we get punished? Wasn't it painful, to do something not the way we are supposed to do? What about getting a bad grade in school? Failing in class?

**Your subconscious mind is like a GPS.** It’s programmed with all the data from your past — good and bad. Pleasureful and painful. And it’s using that data to navigate your future. With every laser focus experience you are focusing in on (eliminating the rest), creating your perception... thoughts... emotions... and expressions. They shape your circumstances and places you go to.

So, if you’re trying to manifest something that doesn’t align with your subconscious programming, it’s like trying to drive to New York with your GPS set to Los Angeles. You’re not going to get there, no matter how many times you say, “I’m in New York!”.

This is how most people approach manifestation. Which is why they never get to their big destinations.

They never addressed the GPS! Which controls your manifesting energies - *thoughts, words, actions, intentions* and the *circumstances* they lead you to.

**‎**

# Why This Works (And Affirmations Don’t)

Here’s the truth: most people only manifest small things because of the **placebo effect**.

When you first learn about affirmations or scripting, it’s exciting. It’s **new**.

1) You expect it to work, and because 2) you’re actively looking for proof, you find it — thinking *'it works!'* just like a sugar pill can cure symptoms of an illness, **if you Believe it will**.

This is why ALL medical research is tested against this *Placebo effect* and **Belief**. The most powerful thing that can even cure physical illness.

But what happens then, for most people?

Reality sets in.

Because when you try to manifest something *big* — potential of failure, making a mistake, conflicting with strong memory imprints — you hit a wall. Whether you try and fail after first attempt. Procrastinate. Your mind always **shuts it down** before it even begins.

The resistance is so big, that after few failures - most people quit.

You see, affirmations, visualizations and other techniques (for most people) do not address - how beliefs and memories get created in the first place. Beliefs simply do not change, from saying empty words. Words do not imprint. Why?

Our subconscious mind needs **Evidence. Experience.**

This is how ALL of our memories, emotions and beliefs are stored in our subconscious mind. Think about it. Every time you feel 'I'm not confident', you have a REASON. And experience that happened, which became proof for that thought (belief). If I asked you why you think so, you would say 'xyz' reason, and things that happened. Which made you believe it.

The QPH Method, on the other hand, taps into your brain’s **Reticular Activating System (RAS)** — the part of your brain that controls what you see and focus on - allowing you to choose what you want to experience. Unlike affirmations, finding real *evidence*, that becomes *emotional experience* inside the body - energy, that is required to *rewire neuronal pathways.*

This is what allows you to create a belief of being confident, and then your RAS begins to see ONLY that. Finding evidence and experiences, where you did appear confident. Making you feel good and strong. Giving you a REASON to believe that you are that!

And this method helps you achieve it as simply and as fast as saying affirmations. But actually creating real, permanent subconscious transformation in just 21-30 days! If you have self-awareness, the changes can be seen even in weeks if not days.

You never have to say empty words or “fake it till you make it.”. It’s about *becoming it,* so you don’t have to fake anything.

‎

# Who This Is For (And Who It’s NOT For)

Let’s be real: **Not everyone is ready to take responsibility for their reality.** It’s easier to blame the universe, your ex, or your circumstances than to do the inner work. Passing away responsibility to outside world, or 'things are happening to me'...

Most people aren’t ready to hear this. They want to believe manifestation is about “high vibrations” and “acting as if.”. The magic pill - do nothing and get it now. They’ll keep chasing techniques while wondering why nothing is changing. Never looking deeper.

The mind even blocks many people from seeing the truth.

*...it would imply many of the faults... failures and pains... are = 'my fault'*

But in reality. They are not your fault. Because you never had the choice, for what circumstances you will have early in your life. Which will program your mind.

I never had a choice, to not experience losing my dad at the age of 6, and how that will affect my fear of rejection, approach anxiety, identity, jealousy in relationship, manifesting a breakup... Growing up my mom couldn't give me money for lunch when I saw everyone else have some. I continued on a similar path and struggles in my mid 20's, living from paycheck to paycheck, in debt. Until I changed my programming.

Now I can never have the same struggles with rejection, dating, jealousy or relationships. I can meet anyone I want. I send my mom monthly checks so she has more than her pension each month. I changed all of that in a very short amount of time... my life reshaping itself, right in front of my eyes.

As I’ve tested this belief change method over and over, for over a decade now, with 10,000+ beliefs that I changed for myself and others, it has never not worked.

The people who actually shift their reality are the ones willing to go deeper. They’re the ones willing to take responsibility, undo their past programming, and take control of their future experiences.

If you’re ready to break free from the cycle of small wins and finally create the life you want, then this is how you can start.

‎

# The Method That Actually Allowed Manifesting BIG Things (Step-by-Step Process)

I call it **The QPH Method**. It’s a simple, 3-step process that rewires your subconscious mind so you can finally manifest the big stuff. If you’re tired of small manifestations and ready to break past your limits, here’s what you have to do:

‎

# Step 1: Identify the Beliefs Keeping You Stuck

This is the harder part. Because most of us are born and told that the world is outside of us. So we keep living in it, without seeing the connection of how each thought connects to emotion, which connects to our experiences outside.

The goal is to develop awareness of your subconscious thoughts and inner chatter arising -> and begin to observe the internal experiences -> and what circumstances they brin us to. Because often, these internal experiences, when they are negative, they have specific themes. That create our desires.

Our **thoughts, emotions and desires** give us hints on what we may believe or find Painful, that is not benefiting us. When we begin to see and identify these patterns, that's when we can change our *Wants* into *Have's* and our *pains* into *pleasures*.

Best book that opened my eyes to this proccess is *'The Power of Positive Thinking'* \- By Norman Vincent Peale. Which is NOT about positive thinking. It's about noticing subconscious thoughts and their connection manifesting our reality outside of us.

*\*Another huge thing that happened for me accidentally, was I was drinking Ashwagandha root extract as a supplement. Back then I didn't know what it really does. I thought it was to reduce stress. But Ashwagandha has the power to sensitize every single cell in the body, and open up receptors - basically allowing to think faster, clearer - every thought is more vivid, every experience is more apparent, every imprint is stronger and easier. And many people who struggle with self-awareness, or 'seeing change', I found that ashwagandha helps activate this ability.*

After you know what it is you WANT (the lack) or what emotion you want to move away from - you have to find the exact opposite of it.

‎

# Step 2: Use the Law of Polarity to Find Proof of Its Opposite

**Your subconscious mind can’t hold two opposing beliefs at once.** In Psychology this is called Cognitive Dissonance.

If you find proof that your desired belief is already true, the old belief ceases to exist *- automatically.*

For example, if you think *'I want confidence'* it means you don't have it right now. By implication.

But when you think I have confidence, you can no longer want it. Because it's something you have.

How do you find evidence and proof, that you have it already?

‎

# Step 3: Ask a Focus-Shifting Question

Your brain filters reality based on what you **focus on**. Most people focus on what’s missing. That’s why they stay stuck.

Remember the famous quote in the Bible?..

It's also in the Quran... and other religious scriptures....

And it's there fore a reason. Because Gods greatest power, instilled into everyone of us, including You - was inside of you all along.

>*''ASK and you shall RECEIVE''* \- **The Bible (Christian Bible), Matthew 7:7-8**

>*''ASK me and I shall GIVE you''* \- **The Quran (Islam Bible), Surah Ghafir: 60**

>*''CALL to Me and I will ANSWER you.''* – **The Tanakh (Jewish Bible), Jeremiah 33:3**

Our brains Reticular Activating System, which controls our focus, based on all beliefs and memories in our subconscious mind, can consciously be controlled, by - *asking questions.* Psychology experiments have proven, that human focus expands. And often when we look for things, we can find them - *even if they are not there.* Our minds begin to identify anything relatively close, to what we look for.

>The second part of the verse is - *''Seek and you will find''* \- **The Bible, Matthew 7:7-8**

When you ASK a question, your mind goes into your subconscious, and finds - an ANSWER *(receives)*. That answer becomes evidence, which we experience. Creating energy and emotion, that travels into our brain to form new neuronal pathways. And by law of Polarity, naturally replacing exact polar opposite beliefs.

*\*When I discovered The QPH Method, I didn't see it through the eyes of religion. I lost faith and belief at the time. I relied on my Medical degree with Advanced Psychology and dozens of books that I've read. But later I realized, that my discovery and understanding, is like a new human ability, which is literally - a god given superpower. To change and control your reality and pre-determined fate.*

So what do you do? Ask yourself *1) Positive 2) Assumptive* **question** for a belief you want to have:

* *“How successful am I?”*
* *“How loved am I?”*
* *“How confident am I?”*

That's when you actually go from *'I WANT to be confident'* (implying that I am not confident right now)

To *'I am confident'* (Through the Universal Law of Polarity = replacing *wanting*, with *having*)

And you’ll begin to see and notice experiences where you *are* these things. Over time creating more evidence, more experiences for what that  belief represents in your mind.

You no longer have to try and CONTROL you thoughts and emotions. They change naturally, as a consequence of what you believe, see and experience.

But the important next step, is to make a belief unbreakable ***- permanent.***

You have to make it a habit, so that it finds evidence for you, subconsciously *- for the rest of your life.*

‎

# Step 4: Reinforce It Daily Until Your Subconscious Accepts It

Unlike affirmations, this method forces your brain to accept the new belief as reality. The more you find proof, the more your subconscious energy pathways change. In **30 days**, this becomes your new default reality.

1. **Polarity:** Focus on what you *have*, not what you want (lack).
   * Example: Instead of saying, “I want to be confident,” assume, “I am confident.”
   * Why it works: Your brain can’t focus on two opposites at once. When you focus on having, you automatically eliminate wanting.
2. **Question:** Ask assumptive questions that direct your focus.
   * Example: “How confident am I?” or “How good does it feel to make money?”
   * Why it works: Questions control your focus. And your focus creates your reality.
3. **Habit:** Repeat this process **for 30 days** to make it permanent.
   * Why it works: Your brain rewires itself through repetition. After 30 days, the new belief becomes automatic.

‎This is the QPH Method that I discovered. That worked for over a decade for me, without ever failing. With 10,000+ different beliefs I changed for myself and others. And it has not failed once. 

*\*Self-Awareness is KEY - whether you'll see change, or not see it and continue to live in the outside awareness. The change always happens. 100% of the time.*

‎

# The Hard Truth: This Isn’t a Quick Fix

Here's the reality of beliefs: **You have dozens of subconscious beliefs.** Changing ONE doesn’t magically change your life.

For example you can create a belief of being confident. It doesn't automatically eliminate past painful associations of - *rejection, guilt* etc. The deeper, core beliefs, that are tied to our deepest desires and emotions.

Also, if you ask a question *'How am I a millionaire?'* it doesn't work, because the mind can't see an answer, of something you have never seen. It's not familiar. This is where visualization can help. To create a MEMORY of something that hasn't happened yet. And when it becomes strong enough - it has to reflect inside reality - ***outside.***

**Affirmations were never intended to manifest** these types of things. Since their discovery, and even in Napoleon Hills books (studying Rockefeller, Ford, Edison etc.), affirmations were designed to help *reprogram limiting beliefs.* NOT manifest.

**Visualization** was intended to - imagine your *future, goals, desires, visions and dreams.* (If you notice, this is exactly how most people are manifesting - always)

The actual practice of manifestation if about consciously using *visualization/imagery* for conscious, strong memory imprinting. Visualizing once is the same as asking a question once. It doesn't work. It needs that experience, to become so real, that the mind no longer *Wants*, and recognizes it *Has.*

But childhood... *beliefs*... are what allows some people to visualize and manifest millions, and for others - remain a dream, and a daily practice, without arriving to those dreams.

When I overcame my limiting beliefs, I never had to rely on any other method. I just go and get what I want, without anything standing in between. Without any emotion blocking me. And I produce results, outcomes and creations.

If you want to manifest the life you never had, you have to work to undo the life you had - the difficult childhood... the bullying in school... the familiar reality of seeing parents struggle and feel pain when there's not enough money... the pain we felt when our parents couldn't afford a toy for us or a chocolate... the pain we saw on TV when we saw 'The pursuit of happiness' and the immense deep pain and emotional danger to be poor, to fail, to not have enough, to not be able to provide = and empathized with it... to where it became our association of failure *equals* pain.

These experiences created our beliefs. And those beliefs are manifesting our life experiences. Inside and outside.

But here’s the good news: **Now you can change them. You have a choice.**

**‎**

# Final Thoughts

Manifestation isn’t magic. It already inter-connects with science. The double slit experiment. The rice experiment nobody could believe, tried it and was miraculously repeating on YouTube. The power of our consciousness is directly connected to the physical world.

To gain control of this proccess, It’s simply about understanding how your mind works, how your beliefs create reality and circumstances - and **using that knowledge to create the life you want.**

If you’re tired of settling for small wins and ready to finally break through, the power is in your hands.

1irsqws,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/1irsqws/rope_drop_until_close_very_detailed_wdw_report/,Rope Drop until Close: VERY Detailed WDW Report with LLMP Strategy for Family of 5 (ages 5/7/9),"After soaking up everyone else's Disney wisdom during the planning phase, I'm excited to share our experience! We recently took our three daughters (ages 5, 7, and 9) on their very first trip to Walt Disney World, and it was truly magical (and exhausting!). Our itinerary was to fly in from New Jersey on 2/5, 2 park days, rest day, 2 parks days, fly home 2/11. We stayed on property and spent just about $10k. We did hopper tickets for the added flexibility, and I got LLMP for every day, no LLSP’s at all. We brought a double stroller and rented a single. We ended up going rope drop to close every day and let the kids nap on the go, trying to maximize spending over $1,000 a day. The kids were real troopers waking up early. It was overall an incredible trip that I know we’ll all remember forever. With every ride or show, it felt like Disney just keeps outdoing itself. I’ll give overall thoughts up top and then detailed itinerary below of how it went down. Long read ahead - I realize this level of detail makes me a bit crazy, but it was fun for me! All the time spent memorizing maps and ride heights definitely helped me make quick decisions on the go about which direction to head or which LL to grab.

Dolphin Hotel – I am platinum elite this year and the options at check in were a welcome basket, 1,000 points per day, or $20 daily to the breakfast place. We opted for the $20 daily breakfast credit.  
Being able to grab coffee and pastries before hitting the parks was a huge time-saver. The hotel itself was amazing as the location is perfect. We used the ferry many times, never waited for more than 1 boat even for rope drop or end of the night. The pool was incredible, and the kids didn’t want to leave it. It’s massive, heated, has a slide, a waterfall, multiple hot tubs, a beach, and a playground. We got the balcony fireworks room, the room itself is nothing special just standard hotel room, but that view is beautiful. Our view was of the EPCOT ball, the boardwalk and the yacht club overlooking the lake. You honestly don’t get a great view of the fireworks but seeing the ball all day and lit up at night was nice, I’d recommend it. When you go to and from Magic Kingdom, the internet recommended going to Boardwalk or Yacht club for the bus because you skip the TTC. We did both and found the Yacht club to be better especially with the strollers (1 elevator instead of 3), but that can probably differ depending on where in the hotel you are.

Mears shuttle ($150) – used this to and from the airport and it was convenient, timely and very easy. It was a coach bus, with a bathroom, and we never had a problem. We were the first drop off on the way in (took 40 min door to door) and did 2 pick ups on our way out (took 50 mins).

Amazon fresh (\~$150)– created a delivery the morning we arrived, and it was there at the bell services within a few hours. We only had a mini fridge in our room (there are shared microwaves), so keep the limited fridge space in mind when placing your order!

Kingdom stroller ($86) – pick up and drop off were at the hotel bell hop and I never had to wait to meet anyone. Like I said above we brought a double and rented a single, and for sure it was critical to have a seat for each child. The stroller they gave us was strong, easy to fold, and maneuverable through the crowds.

Memory Maker ($185) – do it, so easy to use and nice to have the professional pictures. There’s a ton of people taking pictures around the parks, and it sends immediately to the app. Rides also send via Bluetooth which is very cool.

Magic bands – we did NOT get them and really didn’t find that we were missing out on anything. The first day you enter the parks they’ll give you a card. It was very easy and saved us some money there.

Disney credit card – I did sign up to pay the annual fee of $49 but got $400 back split up between a gift certificate and statement credit.

Pins – bring some from home to trade! My kids really enjoyed this small, free thing happening all over the parks. We bought a pack of pins on eBay before the trip.

Bubble machine – if you have your own, bring it to save $$$. The bubble refill was only $2, and they sell it all the merchandise stands.

Character meals – we did 2 of them. Cape May café in Yacht club on our off day was a fantastic way to kick off our rest day and was just a short walk from the Dolphin ($230). Minnie, Goofy, Donald and Daisy came to our table several times. We also did the Cinderella castle for lunch ($440) and met Cinderella, Merida, Ariel, Jasmine, and Aurora. The ambiance was magical, and the lamb chops were surprisingly delicious! However, considering the price, it's probably a one-time experience for us.

Fantasmic dining package – Eating at Sci-Fi ($260) was a bit of a miss. The kids weren't interested in the old movie clips, and the preferred seating wasn't worth the extra cost. In hindsight, we would have been better off ordering less food from the regular menu and finding our own seats for the show.

LLMP ($533 for all 4 days/parks) – this was worth every penny! It helped drive our day, and even for the smaller rides later in the day that were a 30 min wait it was great to walk right on. On 2 different days I saved an hour on Space Mountain, and it wasn’t even in our original 3 rides. What I found was that we never had a problem being late for a LL, they didn’t seem to care AT ALL, so just book them the earliest possible time. Same goes for the VQ, they don’t even ask for a reason so no need to worry.

Beyond this, the online tips are all true – bring your own water bottle, snag some cheap ponchos on Amazon before you come, pack a portable phone charger (I went through 2.5 charges/day), bring sunscreen and snacks. We packed a backpack cooler every morning and would bring it on the lines to hand out snacks and drinks to keep the kids happy.

Overall, the parks were very clean, and everything is so well staffed. All the cast members and guest services were nice and helpful. The lines move very well and keep you entertained so waiting 45 mins really doesn’t feel that long. The efficiency of how quickly they load and unload the cars on each ride is very impressive. You are buckled and off in what feels like seconds for each ride. Small detail but those ride pouches to keep your stuff in are a nice touch, not sure why I’ve never seen them at other amusement parks before. We were lucky as NOTHING broke down while we were waiting on lines. Buses, ferries and monorails were all easy to use with great signage, and we never waited for more than a few minutes at any point.

EPCOT – Remy was our first and last ride of the trip and everyone loved it. I think that was my first experience on one of the trackless rides and it was so immersive. Guardians was tremendous, we did it 2x via the VQ (even my 5-year-old), and everyone loved it. Don’t sleep on Soarin, it’s a top ride for sure and easy to snag LL later in the day. With the girls we were obviously very excited about Frozen and honestly it was a little underwhelming. The theming is great, but the ride itself isn’t as thrilling as the other 3 and I’m glad I had a LL for it and didn’t have to wait an hour. It didn’t help that the kids got a little wet on it. I didn’t remember ever reading about that, so we were not prepared - use this as your splash warning!

Magic Kingdom – that fireworks show just WOW, never seen anything like it, this is for sure must-see. So many great, fun rides. Tiana, Mine train, and Space Mountain were the highlights. I sadly missed out on TRON but it looked epic, the line never dropped below an hour, my kids aren’t tall enough, and I didn’t buy the LLSP. We also felt that while it’s a classic, Peter Pan was a little disappointing and felt a bit short and overhyped.

Hollywood Studios – so many good rides here as well and FANTASMIC was incredible. We also watched Indiana Jones show and Beauty and the Beast. Highlights were Mickey and Minnie, Rise, Slinky dog, and ToT. I also really enjoyed the other 2 Toy Story rides. I’m a big Star Wars fan (kids are not) and there is nothing like walking onto Rise for the first time, incredible and so immersive. The overall Galaxy’s Edge was also so unique and fun, but I thought Smugglers Run was just OK, my daughter and I were both gunners and walked on via single rider.

Animal Kingdom – Blown away walking into the park and then over to Pandora, Flight of Passage was an immersive experience (the ride itself is like Soarin but better). Everest was also fantastic, and we all rode that twice via single rider in addition to our LL. The Navi River journey was visually stunning, especially the animatronic Shaman at the end, but the rest of the ride was a bit disappointing – felt slow and uneventful. This was probably our least favorite ride at AK.

Which is kind of crazy, as I've been doing dieting for the gut for a few years now.

But I'm not even sure if the candida is even causing this. I feel like there's a blockage that occurs inside me daily. Where this in result, causes constipation, dehydration, brain fog, weak muscles. Then certain things like my smell, hearing and vision don't work as well. 

I kind of picked up on it one random day. As I was heading to work. And I noticed my mood was happier, as well as I was getting excited over smells. I mean all kinds of smells coffee, food carts, grass, trash, chemicals and all. 

At first I thought it was a reintroduction of blueberries and it improving my hormones. But then when I started still experiencing the no sense of smell with that. I realized it's something happening inside of me, where it causes my nose to be really dry, as well as eyes and overall. 

I'm always trying different variations of things to figure it out. But I can honestly say, on one end not having smell. It kinds of eliminates cravings, like if I were to smell baked goods or something. Even tho I probably wouldn't, as I know the pain that comes with that. 

Then it also explains why I'm always so tired and even struggle to walk up easy hills. Because I'm probably not getting enough oxygen and airflow, due to whatever is blocking this function. ",1,1739821283.0,Candida,0,0.99,False
1irspuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1irspuf/meri_jaan/,Meri jaan,"I almost messaged you today, well this morning for me, evening for you. I nearly broke the silence, the towering months that lie in between today and the last time we spoke. 

I had a whole message typed out for you. I read it, I reread it, I erased some things that sounded too cheesy, added some lines that I felt captured a summary of what I want to say to you. But I never pressed send. 

That’s the closest I’d gotten to breaking my silence from you since we last spoke. I didn’t want to break the silence until I was sure in my heart. I once heard that the intoxicated mind speaks the words the sober mind tries to hide. I haven’t drank since that night I called you, but I remember exactly how I felt, hearing your voice again through my phone. It made me feel more alive than I have in years. 

But since these many moons of silence, I feel as if I’ve been at war within myself. I got too lost inside my mind, just as you warned me not to. I have just now reached a point where the clouds have lifted and I feel the sun on my face again. 

It’s been glaringly obvious what I’ve been trying  to fight, trying to hide from. I can’t lie to myself anymore. 

I am in love with you. I don’t know if you still think of me, or if you even would feel the same way towards me anymore. I’m unsure if you would even welcome me back, because of the pain and confusion I may have caused you in my silent, inward retreat. 

When I think of my future, I keep picturing you beside me. 

When I think of how I want to spend my mornings, I want nothing more than to wake up to you sleeping softly beside me, while I sneak away to make us coffee or chai. 

I think of dates I want to go on with you, whether that’s photography dates, nature walks, picnics, movie night, etc. It could be anywhere, I could be doing anything, as long as it’s with you. 

I think of food I want to cook for you, for your friends, for your family. 

I think of children with you. You make me want to be a mother. That’s something I have never felt in any of my past relationships before. 

I think of marriage with you. Not just a physical marriage, but a spiritual one as well. I want a life partner. I want to spend my life with my best friend. 

I cannot get you out of my head. I keep seeing things that either remind me of you or seeing things that make me with I was sharing the experience with you. You are even in my dreams still. 

I wish you could see how much progress I have made, physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually. For the first time in my life, I feel that I have a relationship with the creator of the universe. I have prayed more in the past 10 months or so, than I ever have in my whole life. 

I even pray for you. I pray for your health, your happiness, your career. Even if we never speak again and never get to meet in real life, I still will pray for you. You will always hold a special place inside my heart, I feel a piece of me will always belong to you, no matter my life’s circumstances. 

I appreciate the small moment in time you were in my life. I love and appreciate everything you have taught me. I admire the person are becoming, you are a man who deserves respect and appreciation, and I’m sorry I let my fears and anxiety sabotage such a beautiful thing that we had together, even if it was only long distance. 

I’m still planning on traveling to India one day, even if it’s not to meet you there. Maybe we could finally go out for that coffee, even if just to sit in front of each other for a moment, to prove that you are real, that what we had was real, even if just for a brief moment. (ps, I’ve made so much progress in learning Hindi and I know you would be so proud of me). 

Even if we never get the chance to meet, I feel I will still always love you. It feels unconditional, unchanging. I guess that’s how I know it’s true.

Leeds and Manchester have boomed in the last decade, pulling in massive investment, corporate headquarters, and better infrastructure. Meanwhile, Sheffield seems to struggle with big developments (like the new city centre projects), and we still don’t have an airport worth using.

So to explain my situation, I drank a delicious cup of coffee in a specialty coffee shop made with an aeropress. It was a light roast ethiopian and was very fruity. This experience made me buy an aeropress and a grinder (Kingrinder K6). Since then, I have been desperately trying to replicate this taste but never achieved to obtain a juicy cup out of my set up. 

I tried A LOT of different methods (regular, inverted, bypass, ...) but none of them gave me the acidity and juicy flavours I am looking for.

For details, I tried to grind very coarse (between 100 and 120 clicks on K6), reduce water temperature (I don't own a temperature controlled kettle so I usually wait approximately 2 or 3 minutes after boiling), I tried different ratios (14g/200g, 15g/250g, 16/200g...), I reduced brew time (1 minute) and even tried to use by pass methods (25g/100g and pour 130g of additional water). But as mentionned before, none of these recipes gave me this cup I crave for.

So now I would like to know how you would brew your coffee to develop fruity and acidic notes. I think what I look for is a recipe giving a ""pour-over"" like cup out of the aeropress. Thank you very much for your help !

While I’m consistent at work, grocery shopping, and doing minimal chores, my partner does little around the house and complains when things aren’t done.

Our recurring argument centers on him feeling I don’t do enough, especially when it comes to meals.

I feel frustrated and unsupported. My partner only shows affection when he wants sex and doesn't recognize the effort I put in. Never conversations about solutions; he only points out my shortcomings. I'm torn because I know I'm not always at my best, but I feel unloved and unappreciated. Sometimes, I think it might help to take a break and live separately for a while. I don't have anywhere to go temporarily, and don't think it will be wise to get stuck in a lease.



Long version: (I'm sorry, I'm sure this is very ranty and typos. I'm at work and really shouldn't spend my time doing this but I am just so bothered.)

My partner says I do not do enough and gives me the cold shoulder constantly.
I’m not really sure where to start, so I’ll begin with some background information: I’ve been dealing with chronic health issues that affect my hormones. The medication I take often makes me very tired and it can be difficult to wake up in the morning. Along with this, I struggle with depression, which either stems from my hormonal issues or is made much worse by them.

I find myself in a constant cycle where I’m productive for 2 or 3 weeks, and then for the next 2 or 3 weeks, I’m dealing with migraines, feeling unwell, and just generally drained. This makes it hard for me to be consistent and stick to routines or habits.

However, there are areas where I do manage to stay consistent:

Work: I have a high-paying, high-stress sales job, and I perform well. Despite my health struggles, I always make sure my well-being doesn’t affect my work.
Grocery shopping: While I’ve struggled with this in the past, once my health issues started being addressed, I’ve been consistent with it for the past year.
Chores: I’ve set up a 2x daily chore system where I do at least two chores every day—one in the morning and one in the evening. This doesn’t cover everything, but it’s the bare minimum I can do on tough weeks. My partner helps out by emptying the dishwasher 75% of the time, doing his own laundry, getting our water, and occasionally sweeping the floor. If something doesn’t get done, he doesn’t take care of it, and he tends to complain.

When it comes to meals, I usually make lunch and dinner during the weekdays, but weekends vary depending on our plans. My partner always makes breakfast, since I don’t wake up as early as he does, and I’m not usually hungry for breakfast—I prefer fasting, though I love what he makes and enjoy eating it.

Sometimes, if I’m not having a rough week but have a big project at work, I’ll come home late (around 7:30 p.m.), and my partner will be watching TV. He gets home around 6 p.m. If I don’t make dinner, he gets upset, but doesn’t put any effort into making it himself.

Two weeks ago, I had a particularly bad week. My doctor increased my medication dosage, which makes me more tired, and it will take 4-6 weeks for me to adjust. In the meantime, it’s been incredibly difficult to get out of bed in the morning, and I feel mentally and physically drained after work. My meds are taken twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.

Last week, I also had a family emergency, which is still ongoing. As a result, lunch and dinner have been less consistent over the last two weeks, though I’ve managed to keep up with dinner more regularly. However, my partner buys a second lunch even when I make him one, so I’ve been prioritizing lunch less. For lunch, I usually make him 2 servings of chicken or beef, and an entire can of mixed vegetables. He's a very tall and muscular dude, so he's still hungry after lunch...

This has led to recurring arguments with my partner, usually every couple of months. He gives me the cold shoulder, and when I ask about it, he admits he’s unhappy with me for not doing enough.

On Friday, we had a great Valentine’s Day. The next morning, I slept in a bit, as I usually do on weekends (until about 9 a.m.). He was still in bed, watching TV, and we ended up having a great session together if you catch my drift. Afterward, he said he was going to look at breakfast recipe videos in the living room, joking about me making breakfast. I laughed but didn’t acknowledge it. I told him to give me 10 minutes to finish myself off, and i'll be out.

When I joined him, I started doing chores while brewing coffee. He got up from the couch and began making breakfast. I sat down with my coffee, scrolling on my phone, and when I finished my cup, I got up to clean up after him so he wouldn’t have to. At one point, I playfully got in his way and made a kissy face, just trying to show a bit of affection. He looked down at me, recognized what I was doing, and walked around me. When he walked away, I said, “You know, every time you ignore my bids for affection, it really hurts my feelings.” (recurring issue.)

He then responded by saying that I never make breakfast and it would be nice if I made breakfast once in a while, even though I actually do sometimes. But apparently, it’s not enough. It turned into an argument. He complained about me not doing enough. I defended myself as I always do, and he hit me with the same response he always has- I think I do more than I really do.

I know my inconsistency is frustrating. I am so frustrated by it. I know there are some weeks i'm genuinely not doing enough, but those are few and far between. Regardless of how much I do on good weeks, my partner still doesn't give me affection. He used to years ago. Now, he only gives me affection when he wants to have sex with me.

I feel so unsupported and uncared for. I can't talk this out with him because the conversations are never constructive or discussing solutions. He only acknowledges where I am not doing enough, but never how he can help me. I honestly feel like I need to move out for 3 months and see how we both feel after. I'm really tired of feeling unloved and unappreciated, but I guess i'm torn too because i'm not always my best and then I question my perception.",1,1739820941.0,AskMenAdvice,9,0.67,False

1irske4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1irske4/the_white_houses_darkest_secret_the_night_they/,The White House’s Darkest Secret: The Night They Replaced the President.,"I saw the President change before anyone else. Minor slips at first. Tiny erosions of habit, slight warps in personality. A transformation in slow motion. The way he studied his portrait. The way his clothes grew loose on his frame. The way he traced his signature again and again, as if relearning his own name.

They say now I should have raised the alarm. As if I were the only one who watched it happen. As I alone could have stopped it. But a valet's duty is to serve, to follow orders—not dispense them. 

The coffee was the first sign. He always took it black—""Navy style,"" he called it. But one March morning, he pushed it away. Wrinkled his nose like I'd served him a cup of motor oil.

""Not today, Sam,"" he said. ""Stomach's not feeling right.""

And yet he started eating more than ever. Cleared his breakfast plate, then asked for more. Did the same at lunch, dinner. Started calling down to the kitchen at midnight for extra food—steaks, potatoes, entire chickens. The kitchen staff had never seen anything like it, joked about finally having a president who appreciated their cooking.

That's what made the weight loss so mysterious. His belt suddenly needed extra notches. His suits hung loose, his shoes slipped right off.

Doctors filed through the White House for weeks. Blood tests, MRIs, full physical workups—all came back normal. They called it stress, prescribed nutritional supplements, adjusted his diet. But nothing stopped the wasting.

My response was what it always is—maintain standards. I called in the tailor, who could hem his suits overnight. Who knew to be discreet.

Discretion isn't just professional courtesy—it's national security. The world watches the President for weakness. Joint Chiefs studying his handshake at security briefings. CNN measuring his stride down the Air Force One stairs. The power of the presidency lives in the smallest details. 

A week after the President’s weight loss began, I noticed another shift—his voice had changed, deeper, strained. I had the kitchen prepare him tea with honey, but by evening, his voice was so altered the Situation Room no longer verified his voiceprint.

The changes in the President stayed with me into the evening, still turning over in my mind as I pressed his pants for that night’s state dinner. 

That’s when I heard Dr. Reinhardt in the President’s study. The First Lady stood by the window, arms crossed. I kept my head down, worked slower. A valet learns to be invisible.

The blood tests, Dr. Reinhardt said, had come back wrong four times. Not Type A—the President’s blood type—but something called Rh-null.

The First Lady demanded new tests, different labs. Accused Dr. Reinhardt of contaminated samples, of incompetence. Said she'd have his license if he breathed a word of this to anyone. But beneath her anger was something else. The way her voice kept breaking. How she paced the room like a general facing an enemy that didn't appear on any map, didn't follow the rules of engagement.

That night I looked up Rh-null blood type. Found in fewer than fifty people worldwide. A genetic impossibility. Blood types don’t change. Can’t. Like eye color or fingerprints. Except the President’s fingerprints weren't working in the biometric readers anymore either. 

And his voice. His face.

The meetings started the day after Dr. Reinhart’s news about the President’s blood. Senior staff gathering in the Roosevelt Room—Chief of Staff, Communications Director, the First Lady. Never the President. Standard procedure dictated that such meetings appear on official schedules. These didn't.

I maintained my position outside the Roosevelt Room during these gatherings. Through the door I could hear them—sharp whispers punctuated by sudden silences. The First Lady emerged with her silk gloves twisted tight in her hands, while the Chief of Staff's military posture showed signs of strain.

Their first directive came through official channels: new dietary requirements. Red meat, barely cooked. Herbal teas that filled the air with a bitter smell.

Then came the revised security protocols: no unscheduled interactions with the President, no press access, a strict list of approved staff for face-to-face meetings.

Around that time, I noticed the Chief of Staff watching my movements. Which rooms I entered, which papers I handled. He called me to his office one morning. Asked about my duties, my clearances. Standard questions in a tone that made them anything but standard.

I'd served three presidents without question. Now I found myself checking employee logs, cross-referencing staff transfers. Four senior personnel reassigned in a week. Six the next.

Then, just yesterday, an interdepartmental memo arrived marked ""Internal Distribution Only."" The Chief of Staff requested exclusive use of the Roosevelt Room from 2300 to 0900. No cleaning staff, no security sweeps. Three hours unmarked on any official schedule.

The President's schedule for those hours had been erased—months of state dinners, briefings, gone without explanation. 

At the appointed time, the Joint Chiefs began filing into the Roosevelt Room. No aides, no briefing books. The Chairman carried something wrapped in a red cloth. The First Lady brought a box I had seen in the residence—old wood, brass fittings.

Marine One was placed on standby, the crew dismissed. Instead, a civilian helicopter landed on the South Lawn. Four men in suits stepped out, each carrying a medical bag. Consultants, the manifest said. 

Consultants for what?

The hours that followed saw an unprecedented flow of equipment through the service corridors. Each delivery bypassed standard security protocols, carried by staff wearing clearance badges I didn't recognize. 

I found myself straightening already-perfect picture frames, adjusting already-aligned chairs. Maintaining order in the small ways still within my control as the familiar rhythms of the White House gave way to something else entirely.

At 2300 hours, the doors to the Roosevelt room opened. Staff members consulted clipboards while Joint Chiefs carried in equipment I'd never seen requisitioned. 

""Sam."" The First Lady's voice behind me, sharp as cut crystal. ""A moment.""

She motioned me into the West Wing corridor. Through the Roosevelt Room’s doorway, I observed Dr. Reinhardt directing the placement of a medical monitoring station while Admiral Chen's staff positioned what appeared to be electromagnetic field detection equipment.

""There's something you need to understand about the President's condition."" She studied me with the intensity I'd seen her use on foreign dignitaries who might cause problems. ""The President we're seeing now... isn't the one who took the oath in January."" 

I thought of the coffee he no longer drank. The clothes that wouldn't fit. The signature and fingerprints that had changed.

""Ma'am, are you suggesting...""

Her gaze didn’t waver. ""The American people made their choice. Our job is to uphold it.""

Behind her, Dr. Reinhardt consulted two documents—one on a government tablet, one that looked older than the Republic itself. Staff members measured distances with laser levels, laying down what looked like salt in precise patterns.

""We need your commitment to maintain current leadership structures, Sam."" She held my gaze with executive authority. ""Are you prepared to fulfill that duty?""

""Ma'am, I—"" but the words caught as they dragged the President in. 

Two Secret Service agents I'd never seen before fought to control his movements. He thrashed against their grip, the perfect Windsor knot I had tied that morning coming undone, suit wrinkled beyond salvation. 

Wrong. All wrong. Every protocol, every chain of command violated.

""Unhand the President immediately!"" My voice cracked with an authority I'd never used, never presumed to use. ""This is a direct violation of—""

The First Lady's hand gripped my arm, steel beneath her silk gloves. ""That is not *our* President, Sam. Remember your duty.""

The President's eyes locked onto mine, wild with desperation. ""Sam, please—""

The agents dragged him into the Roosevelt Room and forced him onto the conference table—the same table where he'd signed executive orders, conducted security briefings, shaped the future of our nation. Now they were binding his wrists to the table with ropes.

Every instinct inside me screamed to intervene. To protect the dignity of the office. 

The President's voice came out strangled as he screamed: ""You can't—this isn't—"" 

The agents held him down while Dr. Reinhardt unbuttoned the President's shirt. Brooks Brothers, white cotton, which I had laundered and pressed that morning. 

Dr. Reinhardt fought to attach the heart rate monitor to the President's chest. Admiral Chen positioned strange devices in each corner of the room—like Geiger counters, but the measurements they displayed weren't any units I recognized.

""Sam."" The President went suddenly, terribly still. His voice was smaller now, more fragile. Unlike the man who’d taken the oath in January. ""Please.""

The First Lady's hand gripped my arm. ""Your duty, Sam. To the office.""

I thought of every morning for the past month. Every tie straightened, every cuff adjusted. Every cup of coffee served. What had I been serving...?

The President's eyes locked onto mine, and I finally understood. The man I'd served these past months had never once looked human. Not until now.

""Choose, Sam."" The First Lady's voice carried the weight of the office itself. ""Are you with us?""

A chill I hadn't felt since my days on the battlefield settled into my bones. My pressed collar grew damp with sweat. The Constitution provided for peaceful transfer of power. For orderly succession. Not for this. 

But my duty wasn't to the man. It was to the office. To the choice the American people had made, even if they hadn't known what they were voting into power.

I took my position beside him. My hands were surprisingly steady as I adjusted his collar. Professional standards must be maintained, even now. Perhaps especially now. Dr. Reinhardt checked the monitors—medical and otherwise. The First Lady removed something from that old wooden box: papers that looked like executive orders but weren't in English.

Then we heard it. 

Footsteps in the corridor—wrong somehow. Each step rang against the marble floor with a sharp, metallic click that reminded me of hooves on stone. The door bent inward like rubber, straining against its brass hinges. Then: the door snapped back in its frame.

The silence that followed burned. Until…. the carpet under the door began to rise in the center, as if something was pressing up from beneath. 

Travelling from the doorway toward our position. 

Rippling the carpet like the surface of the ocean when a shark zeroes in on its prey. Past the sideboard. Past the credenza—

The President threw himself against the ropes binding him to the table. His polished shoes—which I had shined to military standard at 0500—kicked against mahogany. I pressed down on his shoulders. Professional standards had to be upheld, even in crisis. Especially so.

""Please remain still, sir,"" I said, as if adjusting his tie. As if I couldn't feel him trembling.

When the bulge reached us, the carpet split with a sound like tearing silk. What emerged was a wriggling, black, eel-like appendage that left char marks across the table’s wooden legs, made the varnish run like melted wax. 

The being—if that term applies—stood to its full height and moved toward the President. 

My hands tensed—then, for just a moment, I nearly let go.

It was instinct. Something deep in the marrow, a primal recoil. The President’s skin was fever-hot beneath my grip, but the thing sinking into him was cold—so cold it burned. For exactly three seconds, the heart rate monitor showed two distinct pulses.

Two beings in the President’s body.

Then only one.

It was finished.

I maintained my position until the First Lady dismissed me. “You’ve done well, Sam. He’ll remember that—when the time comes.” 

I straightened my tie, smoothed back my hair. My reflection showed exactly what it should: a valet awaiting orders. Only later, alone, did I remove my jacket to find the scorch marks on my palms where I had held him down. The burns will make tomorrow's duties more difficult. 

Pressing his shirt. Tying his tie. 

I will note his suit fit. If the collar is too tight, I will have it corrected. And if the President’s hands seem larger than today, I will ignore it.

I discuss everything with my doctor before I take actions. Including anything suggested to me by others or my own ideas.

I am a male, 28 years old, 170 pounds.

For the last 1-2 years I've woken up at least 5 times a night to pee. Here lately its gotten worse and I'm waking up every hour for the first 4 or 5 hours, then the last 3 hours every 30-45 minutes to pee. Its not a dribble either, most the time its just a full blown urination, maybe not as long as during the day but its not a dribble or anything. Other than urination problems, even before it was a problem, I suffer from extreme fatigue, headaches, pain in my neck and back thats chronic and crippling so I kinda take excedrin more religiously than i should.

I do have weak pelvic floor muscles, PT didn't help but even then I don't understand this kind of frequency.  
I have tried everything to fix this urination problem.

My List of medications and supplements (all taken once a day): Metoprolol , Pantaprazole, Duloxetine, Montelukast, Tizadine

Creatine , D3, One-A-Day, Boron Citrate, Magnesium Calcium & Zinc. Lately I've also been taking mucus meds but that isnt a year round thing.

\* I have checked my blood sugar. For 3 mornings when waking I took my blood sugar and it was always between 75-95 . Checked it 1 hour and 2 hours after eating on each of those days and it was never above 120 even after a sugary meal.

\* I tried cutting the one a day vitamin for a few days, no changes.

\*I tried cutting back artifical sweetners, didnt help much. I thought it would because I went to 3 times a night but then it went back to 5+ .

\* I tried cutting the Pantoprazole because one reddit thread said someone had urination as a symptom.

\* All I drink is water except my one morning coffee, I stop drinking large water about 3 hours before bed, only taking very little sips when my mouth is dry and when I need to take my before bed meds.

\* Went Carnivore diet for a month to eliminate food groups that might be causing issues.

\* Went to only have a single cup of coffee when I wake up to avoid late day caffeine. Before I had no caffeine as well and didn't help.

\* Urology didn't make a comment of my prostate during exam, just the pelvic floor muscles.

\* My blood work only shows very slightly high BUN (22-25) during blood work. Everything else is within normal range. I have a kidney ultrasound on the 28th to check for damage there.

\* I had sleep apnea testing 3 times, only once showed very minor apnea, so minor he didnt even wanna give me a cpap. We did anyway and it didn't help when i managed to not rip it off or forgetting to put it back on after a bladder void.

I'm desperate. I never feel rested. I just wanna go to bed all the time and my head is killing me all the time. Just need more suggestions from people to try or look into and discuss with my doctor.",1,1739820483.0,OveractiveBladder,3,1.0,False

And it’s not just because I love coffee, I mean we all do, right?

It’s because I was a part of one of the leading coffee businesses in the UK for years. We tested coffee types, machines, brew methods, recipes…you name it. 

Thing is, you can get cafe-quality coffee at home for a fraction of the cost per cup (if you divide the number of cups you make with the amount you invest in coffee machines.) whenever you want it. 

Now, there are three coffee machines on my radar that are amazing if you’re just starting out your journey with espresso machines, [Chefwave Espresso Machine](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B07S2T5NZV), [Casabrews Espresso Machine with Grinder](https://new-releases.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B0C533HGCS) and [Casabrews Espresso Machine Without Grinder. ](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B0D53126XJ)

Getting a machine with a grinder is always good if you love to grind your beans fresh. But it also takes a bit more time, so that decision’s totally on you.

# My Final Thoughts

✔ **Best Overall**: Casabrews (Without Grinder) – If you have a good grinder (like the Encore), this is **the best choice** for **amazing espresso**.

✔ **Best All-in-One**: Casabrews (With Grinder) – A **convenient** choice for those who **don’t want to buy a separate grinder**.

✔ **Best Budget Option**: Chefwave – **Cheaper, smaller, decent** for beginners but **not as high-end** as Casabrews.

Would you pick Casabrews, or does the budget-friendly Chefwave still sound tempting? 🤔",1,1739820197.0,ScootersCoffee,0,1.0,False

It was mostly grass clippings and leaves to start. Then I added food scraps daily, 2-3 lbs worth. Then cardboard boxes shredded. Not much was happening until I added coffee grounds.

I pretty much stopped adding things to this pile a few weeks ago, it was at the point where I would add food scraps and they would be gone in a day or two. 

I started a new pile about a month ago in another spot.  My plan is to sift this pile, move anything not broken down to the new pile and plant on top of where this pile was as a new garden bed. 

Today I started sifting it, and the results look good to me. A big thanks to this sub. I've read a lot here and haven't posted but it helped me tremendously.

I am 36F, 5 ft 95 lbs and have had elevated cholesterol for years. I used to blame it on genetics since my dad has high cholesterol too and I have always been on the skinny end, but in December my number got so high I couldn’t ignore anymore (206). My doctor recommended statin, but I told him to let me try making some adjustments first, then revisit in 2 months. So from December to February I made a few changes:

- Start eating breakfast whereas I used to skip or have a fast food sandwich for convenience. Alternate between overnight oats, non-fat Greek yogurt and granola bowl, or smoothie. Always use oatmilk and add some flax/chia seeds, protein powder and cut up fruit.

- Eat lean meat like chicken breast, fish, shrimp, tofu, and phase out red meat almost entirely. Always have a serving of veggie at lunch and dinner, followed with some fruit. 

- Sub regular milk with oatmilk for all coffee. Trying to drink more tea and less coffee but it’s hard!

- Mix quinoa with rice for base starch (Asian diet)

- Exercise 3 times a week (20-30 mins on Peloton each time)

- Take fish oil twice a day

- Im not totally strict on myself though, still eating dessert here and there, red meat at dinner parties etc

I know I got a way to go with LDL at 139, but this is encouraging. Glad I started on this journey, hopefully this is helpful for someone else out there that’s going through the same! ",12,1739820039.0,Cholesterol,9,1.0,False

📜 **Legal Definition:**  
Intentional torts require **(1) a voluntary act, (2) intent, and (3) causation.** You either:

* **Had purpose (aka wanted this result),** OR
* **Knew with substantial certainty** that your actions would lead to this result.

💡 **In Simple Terms:**  
""You didn’t just trip and land on me, Brad. **You shoved me.** And now I’m calling my lawyer.""

🎬 **Examples:**

* **Battery:** You throw a drink at your ex at the club 🍹 → **Battery.**
* **Assault:** Someone squares up like they’re about to swing, swings at you SEE IT COMING→ **Assault (b/c you had imminent apprehension of harmful contact).** If they actually hit you? **Congrats, now it's also battery.** 
* **False Imprisonment:** You lock your friend in the car as a prank → **Congrats, you committed false imprisonment.**
* **IIED (Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress):** You fake a text that says your BFF's cat died just to see their reaction? 🚨 **IIED!** (I would sue for IIED so fast my cat is my bestie) 

# 2️⃣ NEGLIGENCE (a.k.a. ""Oops, My Bad"")

📜 **Legal Definition:**  
To prove negligence, we need **DUTY, BREACH, CAUSATION, and DAMAGES.**

1. **Duty:** Did the defendant owe a duty of care?
2. **Breach:** Did they fail to act like a reasonable person?
3. **Causation:** Did their breach actually cause harm?

💡 **In Simple Terms:**  
""You were supposed to be **a normal person** and not do dumb stuff. But you did dumb stuff, and now I’m hurt.""

🎬 **Examples:**

* You text and drive, hit someone → **Negligence.**
* Your iced coffee spills in Target, and you don’t clean it up. Someone slips and breaks their hip, and sues you → **Negligence.**

🚨 **Negligence Per Se** = You violated a law meant to protect people, and someone got hurt.  
🎬 **Example:** You drive 100 mph in a school zone and hit a kid → **Negligence Per Se** (because the traffic laws protect pedestrians). Negligence Per Se only applies if the injured person was in the class the law was meant to protect. 

# 3️⃣ DEFENSES TO NEGLIGENCE (a.k.a. ""It’s Not My Fault!"")

📜 **Legal Defenses:**

* **Contributory Negligence:** If the plaintiff was even **1% at fault**, they get **NOTHING** (only a few states use this).
* **Comparative Negligence:** The plaintiff gets some money, but it’s reduced by their percentage of fault.
* **Assumption of Risk:** If you **knew the risk and did it anyway,** you can’t sue.

💡 **In Simple Terms:**  
""If you see a ‘DANGER’ sign and **lick the electric fence anyway,** that’s on you.""

🎬 **Examples:**

* Comparative Negligence: You run into the middle of the street without looking and get hit? **Comparative negligence, your damages get reduced.** 
* Assumption of Risk: You voluntarily join a fight club and get hurt? **Assumption of risk.** (Also, first rule: don’t talk about it.)

# 4️⃣ STRICT LIABILITY (a.k.a. ""Doesn’t Matter If You Were Careful, You’re Still Screwed."")

📜 **Legal Definition:**  
Defendant is **automatically liable** if they engaged in:

1. **Abnormally dangerous activities** (explosives, wild animals, toxic chemicals).
2. **Defective products** that are **unreasonably dangerous.**

💡 **In Simple Terms:**  
""If you own a pet tiger and it eats someone, **you are paying.** No excuses.""

🎬 **Examples:**

* You own a python, and it escapes? **Strict liability.**
* Your blender explodes when used normally? **Strict liability for the manufacturer.**
* You decide to start a backyard fireworks show, and someone loses an eyebrow? **Strict liability.**

# 5️⃣ DEFAMATION (a.k.a. ""Lies That Ruin Lives"")

📜 **Legal Definition:**  
To win a defamation case, you need:

1. **A false statement** about the plaintiff.
2. **Published to a third party** (someone else heard/read it).
3. **Damages to reputation.**
4. **Fault:** If the plaintiff is **a public figure**, they must prove **actual malice** (knowing the statement was false or reckless disregard for the truth).

💡 **In Simple Terms:**  
""If you spread fake tea about someone, **they can sue.** But if it’s TRUE, it’s not defamation—it’s just drama.""

🎬 **Examples:**

* You falsely claim your ex has lice in a viral TikTok → **Defamation.**
* Your bestie posts “MY MOM STOLE FROM TARGET” when she didn’t? **Defamation (if people believe it and her reputation is harmed.**

1irs4rg,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1irs4rg/missing_old_friends/,Missing old friends,"I feel like i've been living in the past recently. I ran into my friend group from highschool, we were all at a local venue for a show and it really struck me that we haven't all been in the same place since i dropped out of highschool last december. The three of them are seniors now, they're all friends and going to the same school. I'm on good terms with two of them but they don't really like to associate with me because the third friend has issues with me. I'm not sure why, i've heard varying stories and rumors and i choose not to fully believe them because unless she tells me herself, i don't know for sure. I really want to talk to her and work things out because i genuinely do miss these friends so much. They were the first real group of friends i ever had and we were so close, i know that my falling out with these people was entirely my fault and i genuinely do want to make things right even if the end result isn't us being friends again, i'd at least like to be on good terms. 

after seeing them all, all the memories just came back. walking home from school and spending lunches together, skipping class to smoke weed and sharing headphones listening to musical theater soundtracks together. I remember one time i ran into one of these friends at the mall and this guy was pretty much my best friend throughout middle and highschool and everytime he saw me he would hand me his drink (because hhe always had some kind of coffee or soda or energy drink ) for me to try, and when i ran into him i hadn't seen him in months but he still immediately handed me his drink and i damn near almost cried. 

i just miss them all so much and i wish things had gone differently, i wish i had told them i was going through addiction and my family was falling apart instead of shutting them out and lashing out at them, i know it's only been a year since i left school but i feel like i've become a completely different person then, i'm sober and in therapy and medicated again. i hope that person is enough for them to consider forgiving me ",1,1739819865.0,venting,1,1.0,False
1irs3ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1irs3ox/why_has_the_american_left_abandoned_futurism_for/,Why has the American Left abandoned Futurism for Decelerationism?,"I grew up on science fiction. One of the most efficient ways to understand someone’s values is to ask them which visions of the future in science fiction are the most desirable, and which the least. To gauge their understanding of the world, follow up by asking which visions they believe are the most realistic.

Warning: anecdata ahead.

Recently, the visions I hear overwhelmingly from the American Left are a toxic feedback loop of mutually reinforcing cynicism and luddism. This is nothing less than the abdication of technological progress and thus a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Who do I mean by “American Left”? I am a scientist who has been developing biotechnology development in academia and industry for over a decade. I am immersed in multiple social groups of educated, mostly center-left, professionals whose culture has come to dominate the American Democratic Party. (For my foreign audience: this party is the left half of the American political system, with Barack Obama and Joe Biden being our most recent Democratic presidents. It is also—unlike in some other anglophone countries—labeled the “liberal” side of the spectrum.). There is a healthy dose of Bernie and Bernie-adjacent supporters (representing the more populist and social-democratic American Left, who often contrast themselves with what they label as mere “liberals”). I occasionally bump into more radical Leftists, up to and including those who self-identify as Marxists and so forth, and who wish to transform our system of government altogether.

Over the last ten years, and increasingly over the last few, almost all of these Leftist subgroups are responding to ascendant technologies with fear instead of embrace. Let’s look at some examples.

First and foremost, AI. “It will take our jobs.” “It will concentrate power in the hands of the broligarchs.” One group that most certainly agrees with both statements are Hollywood artists. In summer 2023, I pilgrimaged to the Writers Guild of America strike picket lines in Los Angeles and spent a couple of hours speaking with the writers. One of their primary demands was prohibiting autonomous AI script writing.

This is the very definition of luddism. Where is the enthusiasm for this new technology? Can you imagine if AI can reliably produce hit after hit instead of the schlock currently excreted by Hollywood? Isn’t that a future you’d want to live in? Why limit art to human abilities?

(I don’t blame the script writers for the excretions, by the way; Hollywood’s systemic mediocrity is another topic.)

How cold-hearted of me to throw the writers to the wolves! But why? Why is replacing a human artisan with a superior automation taboo? We’ve done it plenty of times before. The 1848 revolutions were driven in large part by industry displacing artisans. The displacement didn’t stop.

And just like 1848, replacement is inevitable. I wouldn’t be surprised if Hollywood itself will become obsolete as a whole: perhaps someone empowered by AI generated script and video software can produce movies on their basement GPU cluster that are just as good. This entire debate will be rendered moot.

So, which of the writers’ concerns are valid? If it is the fear of unemployment, of the inability to survive in our society without a job, then I completely sympathize. Valid. I will give credit to Andrew Yang for popularizing the UBI issue in the US. We must continuously adapt our socioeconomic system to technology. Unfortunately we’ve fallen behind. 

What about the fear of obsolescence? Invalid. I don’t see any moral virtue in preferring a good made by a human artisan versus a machine. If a robot makes better coffee than a human barista, I’ll drink it instead. If you are an artisan whose skill can be automated, then it’s easier to conquer your desire to remain unique and special—the sin of pride—than attempt to stop the inevitable. We are too attached to ascribing magical value to ourselves. This irrational anthropocentrism will not survive the impending technological change. One of my goals is to convince people to let go of this attachment. (If a machine could do a better job writing these articles, I welcome it.) Ego is a solved problem: plenty of extant philosophies, whether secular or religious, advocate for, and provide paths for letting go of pride. I believe we have sufficient understanding of human psychology scientifically, experientially, and culturally to succeed in this endeavor.

The alternative, which is what I usually hear most American Leftists propose, is to prohibit such use of the technology. Instead of embracing technological change and advocating social and political reform to account for it, most of the American left is increasingly Decelerationist. There are several definitions of Decelerationism, but for our purposes here we’ll simply say Decels advocate for slowing down technological progress.

This is futile. It will only backfire. Can you name any technology in history that has ever been globally decelerated?

Let’s take a look at the US longshoremen’s strikes. Many (most?) major ports in the world are far more automated than ours, because of our unions. The American Left as a whole supports the unions instead of aggressively advocating for a way to restructure society to benefit from mass automation. On a fundamental level, the Democrats are the party of the status quo, because even the Bernie wing doesn’t aggressively promote automation of labor and the redistribution of its fruits. Minority techno-progressive voices from its radical wings are scarcely heard. They should be front and center! Because automation is coming at us, front and center. Instead, the leftist bulk in effect remain blue collar luddites. What will we do when all trucking is automated? It’s one of the largest blue collar professions. If we ban it, China will eat our lunch with efficiency.

We urgently need a techno-futurist wing of the party. It should reframe our entire discussion: “Do we want to McWork until the heat death of the universe?” Because that is the logical conclusion of anti-automation luddism.

This wing of the party must prepare to address a whole range of inevitable technological consequences. For example, one fear I am surprised is underrepresented amongst the discussions I hear today is the fear of (semi-)automated warfare and policing. We are entering the age of the Terminator. Autonomous drones will concentrate power even further. If the Left’s response to this development is a futile, ham-fisted attempt to ban weaponized drones, then they truly don’t understand how technology and history work. We should start thinking now about how to structure control of automated warfare to benefit our values.

If we let Decels dominate, we will simply be caught with our pants down. Suddenly: “I need your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle.”

Let’s move on from AI to another technology, one closer to my wheelhouse: human genetic engineering. If there is one domain of science where Left luddism shines, it is biology.

If artificial intelligence is the greatest dream you can dream in computer science, then what is the greatest dream you can dream in biology? Reprogramming life itself, of course! Including ourselves.

The immediate response I hear most often over the last several years of discussing this, including amongst my colleagues? “Hitler!” “Eugenics!” First of all, as I will describe in future posts, this is ignorant knee-jerk synonymizing all human genetic engineering with the evils of negative coercive eugenics practiced by Nazis and others in the 20th century. Second: again, if we abdicate and simply try to ban human genetic engineering, all that will happen is we will have even less say over its future. Insead, we should embrace the liberation that “automorphism”—the power to change ourselves—will grant us. What greater liberty can there be than to transform your body—yourself—as you see fit?

Honestly, the American Left is surprisingly Granola across an entire spectrum of biology-adjacent questions. Granola Liberals. Do you know how many unvaccinated children attend schools in liberal hotspots such as Austin, Texas? I’ve personally met several Granolas who self-identify as liberal and leave their kids unvaxxed. In liberal shopping meccas such as Whole Foods, companies race to label their products as “organic” and “non-GMO”. There is this ubiquitous perception that just because something is artificial, then it’s bad. Once again: ignorance. Just because plenty of processed food is unhealthy garbage, doesn’t extrapolate to mean all “artificial” modifications of “nature” are bad. Agriculture is artificial. Our ancestors have been genetically modifying plants and animals for millenia. Editing a gene with modern technology isn’t biologically that different, and doesn’t automatically make the food harmful. Guess what percent of the nitrogen that makes up your body went through the Haber process? Does nitrogen acquire different metaphysical properties depending on whether it’s fixed by industrial chemistry or by symbiotic rhizobia? 

I consider Granolas to be particularly pernicious, because their technophobic paranoia is metastasizing across huge swathes of our educated publics’ health & medical perceptions. A particularly tragic example of Granolas causing unforgivable harm are their Decelerationist attempts to block Golden Rice—genetically modified to provide vitamin A—in developing countries where many children are malnourished. This disaster has been unfolding for some years, [and here is yet another a recent episode](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/25/greenpeace-blocks-planting-of-lifesaving-golden-rice-philippines). One recurring mechanism blocking Golden Rice is the fear by impoverished farmers that they will lose their “organic” certifications and thus lose their abilities to export their products to the aforementioned proverbial Whole Foods in first world countries. If you are someone who is technophobic because you do not trust the food industry, then isn’t it prudent to regulate it better, instead of throwing out the baby with the bathwater and condemning impoverished children to blindness?

Another technophobic argument I’ve heard many leftists make against human genetic engineering is that it will exacerbate inequality. Once again, cynicism about our ability to restructure society feeds into luddism. If we try to ban it, I assure you the inequality we fear will only be amplified, because the wealthy will not deprive their offspring of all the advantages they can obtain. (As a biotechnologist, I guarantee you that banning human genetic engineering will be the proverbial whack-a-mole.) Instead, shouldn’t we ensure that everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status, has equal access to the latest genetic engineering technology? This will improve lives at both the individual level, as well as make our society and economy stronger.

Why isn’t the Left enthusiastic about one of the technological holy grails humans have dreamed about since the beginning of time? Curing disease? Longevity? Can you imagine how wonderful it would be to transform ourselves, to improve ourselves?

Instead, over and over, the same pattern emerges: the Left is cynical in its ability to transform society, and thus seeks refuge in Decelerationism. But the harsh reality is that this simply abdicates power and makes the Left increasingly irrelevant. If we are to have any say over the future, we must adopt techno-futurist positions. Technological progress is a historical inevitability. You either embrace it, or you lose power. This is so obvious, it feels embarrassing to type these sentences. It feels as if I’m insulting my audience’s intelligence. But for whatever reason, the obvious has to be stated.

Let’s briefly return to Hollywood again. The Hollywood ethos, despite all of their self-perception as “progressive”, is extremely luddite. Name me a movie where any hero chooses to genetically enhance themselves, and remains a “good guy”? On the contrary, all those who do are always villains. I will cover this exact topic in a future post. Suffice to say for now, Hollywood offers no visions of genetic engineering other than dystopias. Is it really because only dystopias sell? Star Trek begs to differ.

So, if my barometer is correct and the American Left has abdicated futurism, who is the Left abdicating technological progress to?

To the American Right domestically, and to authoritarian alternatives such as the Chinese Communist Party globally. (I am aware that the terms “Left” and “Right” are comic simplifications, but I use them for brevity, and my points remain.) Recent events have confirmed that many Silicon Valley broligarchs, many of whom adhere to some variant of techno-futurism, have shifted to Trump’s Republican (conservative) Party. Obviously, the Republicans are a coalition chock full of climate skeptics, anti-vaxxers, and creationists as well, however at the very least they—unlike the Democrats—now have a prominent techno-futurist wing.

This is who will decide our fate if we don’t face reality.

Rapid technological progress cannot remain the elephant in the room. I truly believe that the American Left’s luddite cynicism is one of the central hindrances to it developing its own coherent post-neoliberal vision. Of course, there are hopeful corners of radical thinkers, and to them I say: this is the moment to strike! If the Left wants to recover, it must provide a vision of the future incorporating all rapidly progressing technologies. Decelerationism will simply render the Left irrelevant.

A vision for the future is a great power in and of itself. In the mid-20th century, both sides of the Iron Curtain were filled with visions of space exploration. We would travel to the stars! Conversely, a lack of a vision for the future not only undermines our politics but also leads to our current existential malaise. We no longer aspire to the future, we dread it instead.

Neither I nor anyone else can guarantee that impending technological developments will structurally favor liberal societies as opposed to authoritarian ones. The impact of social media in the 2020s turned out to be counterintuitive to many who grew up on 90s internet techno-optimism! However we have no choice but to navigate these changes. We should embrace the opportunities these technologies bring. Ahistorical Decelerationism will simply let other values take the wheel.

1irs3e7,https://v.redd.it/ymmef3dc1rje1,📍NORTHTOWN LOG 02: THE PLACE I WAS MEANT TO FIND,"I should have left after ten minutes.

After twenty, I knew she wasn’t coming.

The waiter stopped pretending I wasn’t sitting there alone, refilling my water with that soft, pitying smile. I could hear the unspoken words in his eyes—Do you want to wait a little longer?
I didn’t.

I scanned a few credits in and left, stepping into the thick, humid air of Northtown.

A couple raindrops on the concrete took me by surprise. Rain was not in the forecast. 

Suddenly and without warning a blinding downpour swallowed the streets whole.

Muttering expletives, I flipped up my collar, but it was useless. Within seconds, the rain had soaked through my jacket, streaming down my face. I shoved my hands in my pockets and started walking, taking whatever path was in front of me.

Which was problem number two.

I had only been in Northtown for a month, and I still didn’t understand it. A city built upward instead of outward. Bridges strung between rooftops. Staircases twisting through thick jungle overgrowth. Walkways wrapping around buildings and disappearing into shadows.
Nothing here made sense. It was a maze. And I had just gotten myself lost in the middle of it.
Perfect. Absolutely perfect.

I needed a place to check the map on my comm without the rain destroying it. I turned down a narrow corridor, climbed a staircase, doubled back when it led nowhere. The rain blurred everything—the neon lights, the slick pavement, the glowing windows stacked up the hillside like lanterns.

Finally I saw a small, unmarked door wedged between two towering stacks. It could have been anything—an old service entrance, a storage closet. But a warm, golden light spilled from the crack beneath it.

I hesitated.

Then I grabbed the handle and stepped inside.
Heat. Coffee. Something older, richer—wood, maybe. Paper.

I blinked through the rain dripping from my hair.

A café.

A real one. Not one of the sleek, sterilized chains owned by Meridian Corp—this place had mismatched wooden tables, soft lighting, and a massive window revealing the rain-soaked Northtown hillside.

Bridges wove between rooftops. Hanging plants spilled over terraces. The Northtown Stacks glowed in the storm, thousands of windows flickering through the mist.

I was still dripping wet when I walked to the counter.

The woman behind it barely looked up. Round glasses, silver hair, the expression of someone who’d seen plenty of lost people wander in just like me.

“You can stay but you need to order,” she remarked with a welcoming and warm laughter.
 
I hung up my jacket. “Maybe some tea please. Anything decaf.” 

I scanned my credits and looked around as I waited. Hanging plants, exposed pipes, and…books?

Not digital screens. Not projection panels.

Real books.

Stacked on shelves. Piled on tables. Cracked spines, yellowed pages, words that had survived from another world.

It had been years since I had seen one outside of a museum or a collector’s vault.

“You can borrow one,” the barista said, sliding my tea across the counter. “Just bring it back.”

I turned. “You’re serious?”

She shrugged. “Books are meant to be read.”

I set my tea on an open table near the couch as I perused through the book selection. 

Outside, the rain hammered against the glass. A permanent storm, Meridian had decided.

Maybe Northtown was the right move after all. I never got stood up by the women in Desert Hills, but maybe it was worth it just to find this place.

1irs2sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diverticulitis/comments/1irs2sg/second_flare_up_in_four_months_thoughts_on/,Second Flare Up In Four Months - Thoughts on Prevention?,"Hi all - I got my first flare up in October 24 , uncomplicated. Doctor told me to do liquid diet, take CIPRO and flagyl for 10 days and it will get better. I still had some lingering soreness for a month, but I got 100% better and ended up resuming normal eating/drinking.  Social drinker, I drink coffee, and eat pretty healthy. Last four months, I've had a few drinks occasionally, had coffee, eat lots of fiber, workout and my stomach has been pretty good. Then, I had a few drinks this past Saturday and automatically had a flare up out of nowhere. Pretty frustrating... Also frustrating because my GP and GI doctor (someone with 30+ years of experience) have had zero help into prevention. Both have said its caused by ""western diet"" and constipation. But I think I eat pretty healthy and I haven't been constipated?  What has worked for everyone in keeping flare ups at bay? I am 40 and the thought of dealing with this the rest of my life sounds terrible, and surgery isn't exactly a great option. I've read on here about people having surgery and still getting flare ups.

1irs2fz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1irs2fz/need_advice/,Need Advice....,"I would love some advice, as I really want to know if I made the wrong decision and I am very much open to constructive feedback.. Backstory, I am 32 F, Teacher with over 15 years of nannying experience.  I was a Kindergarten Teacher, but I had to unfortunately quit my job in December as my mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer.  My school would not give me any extra time off to go spend time with her, (even though it would be unpaid).  I was so disappointed by that, that I decided to resign.  I am very much a hard-worker, but every part of me wishes bills didn't exist and I could just go spend time with her without working and be able to take care of her.  However that is not my current reality, so I decided to apply for nanny jobs, as Teaching to me felt too stressful during this time with my mom.  I live in a very high cost of living city, so I was very much shocked to see families posting jobs for $20/hour, with a TON of responsibilities included.  Not only is that not a livable wage where I live, its just super sad parents are okay with thinking that is a normal rate for people watching and taking care of their children.  One of my best girlfriends is a tattoo artist who charges $350 an hour for her services, and DAMN right she should she is SO talented and people pay it because she creates incredible tattoos.  I see this in every industry, but childcare, people taking care of your most prized possession, next to nothing?  Just very sad imo.  Anyways I posted charging $26 an hour, which is honestly not much for where I live.  I also have 10 plus years nannying and Teaching experience.  I have nannied before and I have very good references, (I truly care for the kiddos, make sure the house is clean, try to do the absolute best I can).  I had a few offers but I took the job with a very wealthy family, (both lawyers in an extremely nice house).  They initially offered me $25 and I really had to work hard to get that extra dollar.  Idk maybe it is just me its just a bit disappointing as I know how much money they make, and I truly feel I am worth even more than I asked and to have to bargain for another dollar is a bit demoralizing.  I was supposed to start today, but they sent me the contract yesterday and I just could not accept the offer.  They offered no paid days off and sick days would need a 2 weeks notice, I mean how could I give that if I don't know if I will be sick?  Additionally, during my trial I met the grandma who was lovely, but she said that her daughter is extremely particular and not the easiest to impress.  They also reminded me several times about all the hidden cameras in the house and told me the stroller was airtagged.  I have absolutely nothing to hide, so I don't care about the cameras its the principal of them saying we are watching you, and tbh I would NEVER hire someone to take care of my child if I didn't trust them enough to not have cameras.  I grew up in the midwest and that is just not a thing.  I also do not want to work for a family that does not trust me.  I have nannied for a few other families prior to this and they truly made me feel comfortable in their house.  The last family I worked for would get my favorite coffee and just always tried to make me feel like an asset to them and that I was one of the family.  The mom did criticize me during the trial as she said I should always remember to wash my hands before I touch the baby.  I completely understand that, but it was my second day and was not familiar with the routine.  I am so happy to get constructive feedback, but said it in a way that was shameful, and I have to give myself grace that I just did not know.  She mentioned several times about how she really had to plead with her husband to make it the $26 an hour, and I looked up his salary which is public and he makes over a million dollars a year.  In no way do I think just because you are rich. you should spend more, but that truly made me feel like I can't take this job.  ",1,1739819710.0,Nanny,1,1.0,False

1irs0rv,https://www.reddit.com/r/InnerCircleInvesting/comments/1irs0rv/personal_financefire_101_the_p2p/,Personal Finance/FIRE 101: The P2P (Paycheck-to-Paycheck) Paradox,"I recently had a discussion with my daughter over the topic of living paycheck-to-paycheck, or what I call P2P. It's a topic most all of us are very familiar with, whether currently, or from our past. In fact, I remember very well in my late teens exploring this topic and understanding that living with no discretionary income was something I never wanted to do. In the decades that followed, it became my biggest financial fear. That doesn't mean I was never living paycheck-to-paycheck, but it was a constant climb out of my 20s to ensure I minimized the time I spent in that state.

But, that is the paradox present with the topics of earning money, lifestyle, and consumption - We earn money to pay basic expenses first, followed by *consumption* activities that, hopefully, bring more value and enjoyment to our lives. The problem is in the equation or balance of the two, if not managed properly. 

**Lifestyle Creep**

If there's one (I could probably name 6) primary culprit to highlight keeping individuals from being financially prepared for early retirement, or retirement altogether, it's lifestyle creep. That's not to say earnings power, career path, housing expense and other very real financial hurdles and struggles don't play a large role in being able to ""get ahead"" financially. At the same time, I haven't met an individual yet who doesn't like to spend money on things that bring enjoyment to their lives. Whether that is with an extra $5/mo. or $5,000/mo., your consumption habits most certainly matter. And when we allow excess/discretionary income to ratchet up our consumption accordingly, lifestyle creep can become not only a lifestyle, but also a very limiting factor to building wealth.

This is why I always pound the table for one of my top three financial disciplines: Pay Yourself First!

I cannot argue that money is made to be spent. The only augmentation I would suggest is that ""spent"" should be paired with ""invested."" Once you possess the discipline to save a % of every discretionary ($ over and above required expenses) dollar. what is left over can be spent. I will always advocated keeping this spending in moderation all the while increasing investment, but as long as you adhere to a plan of a set %  of discretionary investment, I'm far more forgiving.

**Fixed vs. Maintenance Expense**

One of the pitfalls I see many individuals make is not understanding the the impact of ""Maintenance"" to that of ""Fixed"" or ""One-Time"" expense.  With a fixed expense, a one-time cost is taken on in return for goods or services. Easy to budget for, easy to see the impact of. But in many cases, that one-time expense will bring maintenance expense that may, over time, dwarf the initial expense of the item. This is most often seen in expenses such as pets, recurring subscriptions or supply cost(s).

That book or coffee you purchase is a one-time cost with no attached maintenance. The fancy new piece of workout equipment you purchased may cost $2,000, but could also carry a $40/mo. ($480/yr.) in ongoing subscription cost. Pair it with a gym membership and your annual investment grows accordingly. Add a new family member in the form of a pet to your life and you can watch your discretionary income erode very quickly at the hand of food and veterinary costs.

This is not to say you should not purchase goods and services that add value to your life. You most certainly should. But you must also be very realistic and deliberate to understand the full cost of the purchase, both at time of acquisition and in any ongoing maintenance. Only then will you understand the impact to your monthly income statement.

**Money Mindset**

You'll hear me apply the term ""Money Mindset"" across multiple topics related to financial preparedness. It's a topic I believe most can get their arms around without any explanation. In its most basic form, the money mindset is simply an approach to understanding every after-tax dollar that is entering your account, how it is apportioned, and how much is left after required expenses. You must understand what expenses are ""required"" and what are discretionary. Returning to the purchase of a pet, the initial purchase is discretionary in nature but, once purchased, care and feeding expenses are no longer discretionary. The toothpaste is already out of the tube. 

The key is to ensure you address the impact of the purchase at the point it remains discretionary. Maintenance costs can add up quickly and become very impactful to you monthly income statement. What started as a simple discretionary purchase could well become a financial burden, difficult to get out from under. One-time purchases are easy to budget for and digest. On the contrary, maintenance expense can be a slow financial death from a thousand paper cuts.

The lifestyle creep that occurs as we earn more money and better our financial situation is one born from success. With greater income, you've earned the right for greater enjoyment through consumption. But an effective money mindset operating as your co-pilot will ensure that lifestyle creep remains a controlled event and is simply another variable in your overall financial preparedness equation.

**Summary**

Simply look around for you examples of lifestyle creep in others around you to see the impact, both positive and negative. We all have family members, friends, neighbors and coworkers who appear to live the ""rich"" life through their consumption choices. But it is not without expense, maintenance and, potentially, acquisition of debt. Keeping up with the Jones' is a very real topic in our capitalistic society. 

Each of us earn and consume in very personal ways that we have become accustomed. It is not for any individual to judge the spending habits of others as we may not share the same financial goals. That said, understanding the impact of that spending when other financial goals are involved is of paramount importance. There is a cost involved with consumption and not only at the time of purchase, but also upon long-term financial goals as well.

When some ask the question of ""Can I afford this <purchase>? My answer is always the same:  *I won't tell you that you can or cannot make the purchase, I can only help you understand the impact of it later.* Think about that answer a bit.

Being aware of lifestyle creep in combination with the tenet of paying yourself first is a very powerful combination. It is through that level of awareness that we make decisions that balance our income, spending against wealth creation. That only exists if you can get your eyes of your feet and onto the horizon when it comes to setting financial and lifestyle goals on the horizon, years or decades from now.

Understand every dollar that enters your account, resist the temptation to spend every dollar of discretionary income and slay, or at least tame, the dragon of lifestyle creep. Through your efforts, you'll quickly find you are no longer living paycheck-to-paycheck and your life will become much richer for it. That's a lifestyle I can get behind. 

I'm always happy to answer questions on growing wealth through effective financial discipline.

Be happy, be well, be good to each other!

1irrwnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1irrwnk/a_delicate_situation/,A delicate situation,"Hi guys, this is my first time posting here. And I think it's gonna be a hell of a post. I've not had any relationship except no-strings-attached ones for almost three years. I've recently bumped into an old ex of mine on a dating app and we kinda reconnected. We have been in a relationship two different times: first time we broke up because of distance, second time it was during covid and we couldn't really see each other. My country didn't have any laws to ensure that those who had a relationship with someone that was in a different region could see each other. Since then it's been 4 years. She now studies in the same city I study in. We saw each other during Valentines Day and it was like we never really stopped talking. I think I'm liking her and that scares the shit out of me. First and foremost because after we broke up for the second time I asked her to never contact me ever again. After I had a brutal experience last year (a traumatizing loss) | went through a healing phase and realized that I distanced myself from people that really didn't deserve it, that life was way too short for this type of mistakes. Pride was killing my friendships. Anyway, back to Valentine: we watched a show together, played videogames and then we talked for like 2 hours, during which she tells me she had gone through a rough break up recently. She then told me she didn't like the idea of me going through public transportation for almost 2 hours at 4 AM, so she offered to let me sleep at her house. I was very tired and didn't like the idea of going at home either, so l decided to accept her offer. We didn't kiss nor do anything else, we just slept together. When we woke up we kept talking and, after she made me some coffee, we went to the terrace of the building and hung out there for a lil bit. That's when she hugged me tight and said she was very happy I decided to text her. I just said ""yeah, I'm happy I did it too"". That hug was probably one of the best things to happen to me in the last couple of months. We had some more physical contact now and then during the time we was on the terrace. After a while we went to get lunch, I paid for both to thank her for the hospitality and we kinda kept poking at each other, laughing together and took a couple pics. We were both smiling that whole time. The ""date"" ended and we went to our respective homes, but before we separated she kissed my cheek and hugged me. I haven't felt this type of serenity in a long time, that's how being with her felt. I'm scared that if I do something I'll lose her friendship and I don't really know what she wants since she sends me mixed signals. We will see each other again after the 21st of February, this time it's at my house. I must also add that my previous relationship ended abruptly and I kinda got traumatized by that, so making a move is kinda hard for me. I'd feel exposed like never before. I complimented her and it felt like I was naked in front of a thousand people. Only thing I know is that I like her. What should I do?

1irru04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurism/comments/1irru04/why_has_the_american_left_abandoned_futurism_for/,Why has the American Left abandoned Futurism for Decelerationism?,"I grew up on science fiction. One of the most efficient ways to understand someone’s values is to ask them which visions of the future in science fiction are the most desirable, and which the least. To gauge their understanding of the world, follow up by asking which visions they believe are the most realistic.

Warning: anecdata ahead.

Recently, the visions I hear overwhelmingly from the American Left are a toxic feedback loop of mutually reinforcing cynicism and luddism. This is nothing less than the abdication of technological progress and thus a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Who do I mean by “American Left”? I am a scientist who has been developing biotechnology development in academia and industry for over a decade. I am immersed in multiple social groups of educated, mostly center-left, professionals whose culture has come to dominate the American Democratic Party. (For my foreign audience: this party is the left half of the American political system, with Barack Obama and Joe Biden being our most recent Democratic presidents. It is also—unlike in some other anglophone countries—labeled the “liberal” side of the spectrum.). There is a healthy dose of Bernie and Bernie-adjacent supporters (representing the more populist and social-democratic American Left, who often contrast themselves with what they label as mere “liberals”). I occasionally bump into more radical Leftists, up to and including those who self-identify as Marxists and so forth, and who wish to transform our system of government altogether.

Over the last ten years, and increasingly over the last few, almost all of these Leftist subgroups are responding to ascendant technologies with fear instead of embrace. Let’s look at some examples.

First and foremost, AI. “It will take our jobs.” “It will concentrate power in the hands of the broligarchs.” One group that most certainly agrees with both statements are Hollywood artists. In summer 2023, I pilgrimaged to the Writers Guild of America strike picket lines in Los Angeles and spent a couple of hours speaking with the writers. One of their primary demands was prohibiting autonomous AI script writing.

This is the very definition of luddism. Where is the enthusiasm for this new technology? Can you imagine if AI can reliably produce hit after hit instead of the schlock currently excreted by Hollywood? Isn’t that a future you’d want to live in? Why limit art to human abilities?

(I don’t blame the script writers for the excretions, by the way; Hollywood’s systemic mediocrity is another topic.)

How cold-hearted of me to throw the writers to the wolves! But why? Why is replacing a human artisan with a superior automation taboo? We’ve done it plenty of times before. The 1848 revolutions were driven in large part by industry displacing artisans. The displacement didn’t stop.

And just like 1848, replacement is inevitable. I wouldn’t be surprised if Hollywood itself will become obsolete as a whole: perhaps someone empowered by AI generated script and video software can produce movies on their basement GPU cluster that are just as good. This entire debate will be rendered moot.

So, which of the writers’ concerns are valid? If it is the fear of unemployment, of the inability to survive in our society without a job, then I completely sympathize. Valid. I will give credit to Andrew Yang for popularizing the UBI issue in the US. We must continuously adapt our socioeconomic system to technology. Unfortunately we’ve fallen behind. 

What about the fear of obsolescence? Invalid. I don’t see any moral virtue in preferring a good made by a human artisan versus a machine. If a robot makes better coffee than a human barista, I’ll drink it instead. If you are an artisan whose skill can be automated, then it’s easier to conquer your desire to remain unique and special—the sin of pride—than attempt to stop the inevitable. We are too attached to ascribing magical value to ourselves. This irrational anthropocentrism will not survive the impending technological change. One of my goals is to convince people to let go of this attachment. (If a machine could do a better job writing these articles, I welcome it.) Ego is a solved problem: plenty of extant philosophies, whether secular or religious, advocate for, and provide paths for letting go of pride. I believe we have sufficient understanding of human psychology scientifically, experientially, and culturally to succeed in this endeavor.

The alternative, which is what I usually hear most American Leftists propose, is to prohibit such use of the technology. Instead of embracing technological change and advocating social and political reform to account for it, most of the American left is increasingly Decelerationist. There are several definitions of Decelerationism, but for our purposes here we’ll simply say Decels advocate for slowing down technological progress.

This is futile. It will only backfire. Can you name any technology in history that has ever been globally decelerated?

Let’s take a look at the US longshoremen’s strikes. Many (most?) major ports in the world are far more automated than ours, because of our unions. The American Left as a whole supports the unions instead of aggressively advocating for a way to restructure society to benefit from mass automation. On a fundamental level, the Democrats are the party of the status quo, because even the Bernie wing doesn’t aggressively promote automation of labor and the redistribution of its fruits. Minority techno-progressive voices from its radical wings are scarcely heard. They should be front and center! Because automation is coming at us, front and center. Instead, the leftist bulk in effect remain blue collar luddites. What will we do when all trucking is automated? It’s one of the largest blue collar professions. If we ban it, China will eat our lunch with efficiency.

We urgently need a techno-futurist wing of the party. It should reframe our entire discussion: “Do we want to McWork until the heat death of the universe?” Because that is the logical conclusion of anti-automation luddism.

This wing of the party must prepare to address a whole range of inevitable technological consequences. For example, one fear I am surprised is underrepresented amongst the discussions I hear today is the fear of (semi-)automated warfare and policing. We are entering the age of the Terminator. Autonomous drones will concentrate power even further. If the Left’s response to this development is a futile, ham-fisted attempt to ban weaponized drones, then they truly don’t understand how technology and history work. We should start thinking now about how to structure control of automated warfare to benefit our values.

If we let Decels dominate, we will simply be caught with our pants down. Suddenly: “I need your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle.”

Let’s move on from AI to another technology, one closer to my wheelhouse: human genetic engineering. If there is one domain of science where Left luddism shines, it is biology.

If artificial intelligence is the greatest dream you can dream in computer science, then what is the greatest dream you can dream in biology? Reprogramming life itself, of course! Including ourselves.

The immediate response I hear most often over the last several years of discussing this, including amongst my colleagues? “Hitler!” “Eugenics!” First of all, as I will describe in future posts, this is ignorant knee-jerk synonymizing all human genetic engineering with the evils of negative coercive eugenics practiced by Nazis and others in the 20th century. Second: again, if we abdicate and simply try to ban human genetic engineering, all that will happen is we will have even less say over its future. Insead, we should embrace the liberation that “automorphism”—the power to change ourselves—will grant us. What greater liberty can there be than to transform your body—yourself—as you see fit?

Honestly, the American Left is surprisingly Granola across an entire spectrum of biology-adjacent questions. Granola Liberals. Do you know how many unvaccinated children attend schools in liberal hotspots such as Austin, Texas? I’ve personally met several Granolas who self-identify as liberal and leave their kids unvaxxed. In liberal shopping meccas such as Whole Foods, companies race to label their products as “organic” and “non-GMO”. There is this ubiquitous perception that just because something is artificial, then it’s bad. Once again: ignorance. Just because plenty of processed food is unhealthy garbage, doesn’t extrapolate to mean all “artificial” modifications of “nature” are bad. Agriculture is artificial. Our ancestors have been genetically modifying plants and animals for millenia. Editing a gene with modern technology isn’t biologically that different, and doesn’t automatically make the food harmful. Guess what percent of the nitrogen that makes up your body went through the Haber process? Does nitrogen acquire different metaphysical properties depending on whether it’s fixed by industrial chemistry or by symbiotic rhizobia? 

I consider Granolas to be particularly pernicious, because their technophobic paranoia is metastasizing across huge swathes of our educated publics’ health & medical perceptions. A particularly tragic example of Granolas causing unforgivable harm are their Decelerationist attempts to block Golden Rice—genetically modified to provide vitamin A—in developing countries where many children are malnourished. This disaster has been unfolding for some years, [and here is yet another a recent episode](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/25/greenpeace-blocks-planting-of-lifesaving-golden-rice-philippines). One recurring mechanism blocking Golden Rice is the fear by impoverished farmers that they will lose their “organic” certifications and thus lose their abilities to export their products to the aforementioned proverbial Whole Foods in first world countries. If you are someone who is technophobic because you do not trust the food industry, then isn’t it prudent to regulate it better, instead of throwing out the baby with the bathwater and condemning impoverished children to blindness?

Another technophobic argument I’ve heard many leftists make against human genetic engineering is that it will exacerbate inequality. Once again, cynicism about our ability to restructure society feeds into luddism. If we try to ban it, I assure you the inequality we fear will only be amplified, because the wealthy will not deprive their offspring of all the advantages they can obtain. (As a biotechnologist, I guarantee you that banning human genetic engineering will be the proverbial whack-a-mole.) Instead, shouldn’t we ensure that everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status, has equal access to the latest genetic engineering technology? This will improve lives at both the individual level, as well as make our society and economy stronger.

Why isn’t the Left enthusiastic about one of the technological holy grails humans have dreamed about since the beginning of time? Curing disease? Longevity? Can you imagine how wonderful it would be to transform ourselves, to improve ourselves?

Instead, over and over, the same pattern emerges: the Left is cynical in its ability to transform society, and thus seeks refuge in Decelerationism. But the harsh reality is that this simply abdicates power and makes the Left increasingly irrelevant. If we are to have any say over the future, we must adopt techno-futurist positions. Technological progress is a historical inevitability. You either embrace it, or you lose power. This is so obvious, it feels embarrassing to type these sentences. It feels as if I’m insulting my audience’s intelligence. But for whatever reason, the obvious has to be stated.

Let’s briefly return to Hollywood again. The Hollywood ethos, despite all of their self-perception as “progressive”, is extremely luddite. Name me a movie where any hero chooses to genetically enhance themselves, and remains a “good guy”? On the contrary, all those who do are always villains. I will cover this exact topic in a future post. Suffice to say for now, Hollywood offers no visions of genetic engineering other than dystopias. Is it really because only dystopias sell? Star Trek begs to differ.

So, if my barometer is correct and the American Left has abdicated futurism, who is the Left abdicating technological progress to?

To the American Right domestically, and to authoritarian alternatives such as the Chinese Communist Party globally. (I am aware that the terms “Left” and “Right” are comic simplifications, but I use them for brevity, and my points remain.) Recent events have confirmed that many Silicon Valley broligarchs, many of whom adhere to some variant of techno-futurism, have shifted to Trump’s Republican (conservative) Party. Obviously, the Republicans are a coalition chock full of climate skeptics, anti-vaxxers, and creationists as well, however at the very least they—unlike the Democrats—now have a prominent techno-futurist wing.

This is who will decide our fate if we don’t face reality.

Rapid technological progress cannot remain the elephant in the room. I truly believe that the American Left’s luddite cynicism is one of the central hindrances to it developing its own coherent post-neoliberal vision. Of course, there are hopeful corners of radical thinkers, and to them I say: this is the moment to strike! If the Left wants to recover, it must provide a vision of the future incorporating all rapidly progressing technologies. Decelerationism will simply render the Left irrelevant.

A vision for the future is a great power in and of itself. In the mid-20th century, both sides of the Iron Curtain were filled with visions of space exploration. We would travel to the stars! Conversely, a lack of a vision for the future not only undermines our politics but also leads to our current existential malaise. We no longer aspire to the future, we dread it instead.

Neither I nor anyone else can guarantee that impending technological developments will structurally favor liberal societies as opposed to authoritarian ones. The impact of social media in the 2020s turned out to be counterintuitive to many who grew up on 90s internet techno-optimism! However we have no choice but to navigate these changes. We should embrace the opportunities these technologies bring. Ahistorical Decelerationism will simply let other values take the wheel.

This is targeted at more the average folks who started from a similar build with being skinny fat.

Wondering if anyone else of you guys went through what I'm going through right now with this stomach fat thing.

And what did you guys do or would do after the lessons you learned from getting rid of it?

With my pretty active workout routine right now I feel like I have progress everywhere else except the stomach (which isn't always evident in photos, this photo was taken right after waking up and taking a shower)

Started working out about 33 days ago after not hitting the gym for years.

Eating fairly clean:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/1ien3ip/my\_daily\_meals/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/1ien3ip/my_daily_meals/)

(For about a week now, I cut the raspberries, just use a lot of blueberries now, I also went from 1 chicken breast to 2 chicken breasts for both my salad and dinner ---- I'm also eating a lot more greek yogurt and almonds throughout the day not demonstrated in my daily meals post)

5-10% calorie deficit, and plan to stay there as I also want to be able to switch to a calorie surplus when I start getting more core lifts to a point I want.

But I'm hoping to get rid of this annoying stomach fat/gut...

For the last month, my workout routine is:

80-100km bike ride per day (mostly on trainer right now because of snow/ice)

30 minute jog every day (not hugely intense right now because of snow/ice)

30 minutes of speed rope and then 30 minutes of bag work on my shoulder days.

45 mins to 1 hour of gym everyday 7 days a week (Day 1) Chest/Tri's - Day 2) Back/Bi's - Day 3)Shoulders/Rope/Bagwork - Day 4)Legs/Abs/Rope)

I supplement my bike rides with uncrustables or gels, greek yogurt/almonds, and protein shakes depending how hard I push it that day. The almonds/greek yogurt, and protein shakes are a good way to counter the huge rides loss in calories.

I'm doing a calorie deficit of 5-10% everyday except on weekends. On the weekends, I do a pure maintenance, I feel like it helps me recover faster.

Should I just bite the bullet, take the loss in getting stronger, and cut now? Or just maintain a 5-10% calorie deficit and keep going forward? Right now I can feel like my gym stamina and functional strength and form is coming along steadily. My workouts feel rewarding, and that's a nice mental boost to my days.

I started a month ago working out, after many many years of not working out. I would be much happier without this gut/stomach fat on me.

I don't smoke, drink alcohol, or drink coffee.

I do take creatine.

I've been watching a lot of Jeff Nippard and Renaissance Periodization and slowly learning to tweak my workout with a lot of their suggestions.

So being intoxicated is really his baseline at this point. He also has suspected ADHD, which I think is relevant here.

He never wants to do anything with me that doesn’t involve drinking. ‘Normal’ activities like going out for a coffee or a meal, going for a drive somewhere, just existing in the world and each other’s company. He won’t do it. He won’t come with me to walk our dog after work, he’ll sit on the couch and drink and watch television instead.

I suspect the dopamine rush he gets from alcohol is unable to be matched by normal, everyday activities. And because he is so used to this as his default, anything less than that feels like a chore. If he does have ADHD I’m sure this makes it even more of a struggle.

But it makes me sad. I wish he would come with me to sit in a cafe and share a pastry and a pot of tea. I wish we could take a walk together. I wish we could go for a drive along the coast on a Saturday afternoon just to see where we end up and for that to be enough.

And the time we do spend together is completely tainted by his drinking. As you’d all know, even if he’s not smashed drunk, just being intoxicated creates a different version of his sober self that makes any true intentional and quality time impossible.

*We know him the least*

*We are wary of him the most*

The gentle rustle of leaves filled the air as a boy moved through the drills. He was fast—faster than the others his age—but still sloppy in his footwork. He lacked discipline, was not part of the academy but his enthusiasm made up for it.

His mind wandered.

His grudge for ninjas had pushed him to that.

It had been simple. Too simple.

*A minor change—a shift altered, a team switched.*

No one questioned it. Why would they?

The schedule had always been meticulous, but even the most diligent ninjas overlooked minor clerical errors. Who would notice a single change on the duty roster, buried beneath the many pages of administrative work?

He hadn’t been there when the blade was drawn. He hadn’t stained his hands with blood. He hadn’t needed to.

The man refocused. He continued looking at son.

**He hated ninjas.**

zzz

**The second killer is his predecessor's grandson**

*We fear him the least*

*We are scared of his potential the most*

Laughter filled the park as the two boys dashed through the grass, their sandals kicking up small clouds of dust. The sun was high, casting warm rays over the village, but they didn’t care about the heat. Not when there was a race to win.

He lost, intentionally. He was in a good mood after all. It wasn’t hard to act like an ordinary kid. Because he was one.

Mostly.

Except for when his friend told him to do something.

*Convincing his grandfather had been easy. It always was. A bright smile, an innocent request, just like he was told.*

*So, of course, his grandfather had gone. Had walked right to the secretary, carrying a small bag of wooden toys in one hand and a warm chuckle in his throat.*

*The weren't allowed to enter the office. He knew but...*

*A petulant whine, some spilled coffee, a distraction.*

*Just enough time.*

*The key had been at the drawer, the same place he left the fake one. And just like that, the pieces had moved into place.*

*He had no idea what he did. No idea what he helped plan.*

*He just did what he was told and it just happened that some days later, someone was assassinated.*

He sat up, brushing dirt from his clothes. His friend was on the ground now, dreaming.

**Konohamaru hated ninjas.**

zzz

**The third killer is his son's best friend**

*We trust him the least*

*We hate him the most*

The house was quiet, save for the muffled sobs coming from the next room. He stood in the doorway, watching as his best friend embraced his brother, his fingers gripping his shirts like he might disappear if he let go.

He wished he could say something. Do something.

*He barely felt the other one in the room. The one who shouldn't have been there.*

*Ninjas kept coming in and out. But he remained, hidden from the others in the room.*

*The first explosion was heard throughout the village. The village's leader turned to the window. No orders for him yet.*

*The second and the third.*

*The fourth.*

*A big smoke coming from his clan compound. This time he dropped down on his own.*

*Him and his team ordered to investigate. Investigate the explosions that he planted.*

*A last look at his leader. This was his last chance.*

***""You know what happens if you tell? You know what happens if I even fail?""***

*He wanted to deceive himself, to believe he was being blackmailed—but deep down, he knew it had been his choice all along.*

*He left. His best friend's father and his assassin, the last people in the room.*

He went to comfort them, their father's blood in his hands.

**Shisui started hating ninjas.**

**And all three hated Shisui.**

zzz

**The fourth killer is his old rival's son**

Even in the morning, the ramen shop was as lively as it is in the evening, yet a small space had naturally formed around him—a bubble of distance that no one wanted to cross.

He didn’t mind. He preferred it that way.

He didn't like ninjas, wasn’t one and never wanted to be. He had no village pride, just another person sitting at the ramen bar, passing the time.

A strange sight for anyone who knew him as a newspaper rested on the table, its pages slightly crinkled from wear. He wasn’t one to read the news—never had been—but today was different. If anyone cared to look closely, they’d notice something even stranger.

It wasn’t today’s newspaper.

It wasn’t even this week’s.

Last week’s headlines stared back at him, the inked words old but still holding weight.

He smiled.

""Keep ’em coming, Teuchi,"" he said, placing his empty bowl of what was seafood ramen onto the counter. ""I'm in a good mood today"".

The old man chuckled, already preparing another serving. ""You got it, kid.""

He traced the edge of the paper with his thumb, many news spread out on the page, but he had never seen a bigger headline before.

Naruto kept smiling. He despised his village.

[Entry requirements UK : r/germany](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1ig1mls/entry_requirements_uk/)

Upon leaving Germany yesterday, I again asked for confirmation of how many of the 90 days I have remaining. Passport control was relatively quiet at the time, so I was able to speak to the two officials sat at the counter for a bit longer than I have done previously. Both officials again stated that there is an agreement in place which enables UK nationals to travel to Germany and spend up to 90 days there, regardless of how many days had been spent in the Schengen area prior to the visit. They also confirmed that as long as the UK national leaves within 90 days, they can return immediately. They used the analogy of crossing the border to the Netherland for a coffee to 'reset' the 90 days and then being able to return immediately.

I am a male, 28 years old, 170 pounds.

For the last 1-2 years I've woken up at least 5 times a night to pee. Here lately its gotten worse and I'm waking up every hour for the first 4 or 5 hours, then the last 3 hours every 30-45 minutes to pee. Its not a dribble either, most the time its just a full blown urination, maybe not as long as during the day but its not a dribble or anything. Other than urination problems, even before it was a problem, I suffer from extreme fatigue, headaches, pain in my neck and back thats chronic and crippling so I kinda take excedrin more religiously than i should.

I do have weak pelvic floor muscles, PT didn't help but even then I don't understand this kind of frequency.  
I have tried everything to fix this urination problem.

My List of medications and supplements (all taken once a day): Metoprolol , Pantaprazole, Duloxetine, Montelukast, Tizadine

Creatine , D3, One-A-Day, Boron Citrate, Magnesium Calcium & Zinc. Lately I've also been taking mucus meds but that isnt a year round thing.

\* I have checked my blood sugar. For 3 mornings when waking I took my blood sugar and it was always between 75-95 . Checked it 1 hour and 2 hours after eating on each of those days and it was never above 120 even after a sugary meal.

\* Went Carnivore diet for a month to eliminate food groups that might be causing issues.

\* Went to only have a single cup of coffee when I wake up to avoid late day caffeine. Before I had no caffeine as well and didn't help.

\* Urology didn't make a comment of my prostate during exam, just the pelvic floor muscles.

\* My blood work only shows very slightly high BUN (22-25) during blood work. Everything else is within normal range. I have a kidney ultrasound on the 28th to check for damage there.

  
\* I had sleep apnea testing 3 times, only once showed very minor apnea, so minor he didnt even wanna give me a cpap. We did anyway and it didn't help when i managed to not rip it off or forgetting to put it back on after a bladder void.

1irrkce,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1irrkce/uk_exempt_from_schengen_restrictions_for_travel/,UK exempt from Schengen restrictions for travel to Germany,"Hello. I recently posted the below thread regarding my experiences at passport control when entering and exiting Germany. In short, on two occasions I was told that the UK has an agreement with Germany which means they are exempt from the 90/180 day rule for the Schengen area when visiting the country. 

[Entry requirements UK : r/germany](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1ig1mls/entry_requirements_uk/)

Upon leaving Germany yesterday, I again asked for confirmation of how many of the 90 days I have remaining. Passport control was relatively quiet at the time, so I was able to speak to the two officials sat at the counter for a bit longer than I have done previously. Both officials again stated that there is an agreement in place which enables UK nationals to travel to Germany and spend up to 90 days there, regardless of how many days had been spent in the Schengen area prior to the visit. They also confirmed that as long as the UK national leaves within 90 days, they can return immediately. They used the analogy of crossing the border to the Netherland for a coffee to 'reset' the 90 days and then being able to return immediately. I asked where I can read about this and they pointed me towards [Section 19 of the Aufenthaltsverordnung](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/aufenthv/__19.html). Is anybody aware of this?

1irrfos,https://www.reddit.com/r/limitingbeliefs/comments/1irrfos/why_most_people_fail_to_change_their_reality_and/,Why Most People Fail to Change Their Reality (And How to Finally Control It),"Let’s get real for a second.

Most people in the manifestation and Law of Attraction space are only manifesting small things - angel numbers, free coffees, or random text messages. But when it comes to the big stuff - money, relationships, or life-changing shifts - they hit a wall.

Or they get stuck in the 'wanting' state, unable to escape it.

Why?

Because they’re missing the *real* reason that keeps them stuck.

They’re out here doing affirmations, vision boards, and “raising their vibration,” thinking it’s going to magically change their lives. But here’s the hard truth: **Your subconscious doesn’t care what you “want.” It only lets you have what it believes is safe.**

And that’s where 99% of people go wrong.

Here’s the hard truth: **You’re not failing at manifestation. You’re failing to address the barrier, preventing manifestation.**

**‎**

# How I Went From Broke and Broken to Living My Dream Life

I’m not here to sell you fairy tales. I’ve been where you are.

For 7 *years*, I struggled to manifest anything meaningful. I was broke 7k in debt (half to my ex girlfriend)... my relationship was falling apart right in front of my eyes and I couldn't control my feelings of jealousy and comparison... and I was trying to launch a fitness business for years, jumping from one course or book to another, without making a dime more... or seeing any results.

I tried affirmations, looking in the eye in the mirror, hypnotherapy, did Tony Robins, Brian Tracy, 5-second rule, and every manifestation technique possible. Nothing changed.

Until after breakup I felt like I lost it all. And I dug deep to find out the real problem.

That's when I realized: **I wasn’t stuck because I was “manifesting wrong” — I was stuck because my subconscious beliefs weren’t letting me have the life I wanted.**

That night, accidentally, I developed a method that addresses the very obstacle... transforms subconscious beliefs - and changes thoughts, emotions and behaviors naturally. And here’s what happened:

* I went from **daily social anxiety** → to **ever-lasting confidence, everywhere I go.** (over 10 years now, it has never diminished one bit)
* From **7 years of failure** → to building **multiple successful businesses.** (I average 2k/day, often 5-10k for a single 45 minute consultation)
* From **no money & struggling** → to making more than I ever imagined—**without even working for it.**
* From having **strong fear of rejection (difficulty dating)** → to being able to **effortlessly approach any 10/10 girl and it goes well every time.**
* From **having jealousy and insecurity** in relationship, to **having zero fears, or worries of relationship failing or being left**.
* From strong fear of rejection and approach anxiety to being able to **confidently approach most gorgeous people**, and have it work out well - every time.

And it didn't just work for me. The method I'm about to reveal to you, I tested with hundreds of people, and it worked every. Single. Time.

Because the method I discovered is composed of 3 scientific principles, proven to work all of the time - in everyone. They're always working, even this minute in everyone's lives.

But all of these transformations, singlehandedly, came down to one thing: **rewiring subconscious beliefs to be in full alignment with the life you want.**

*\*I don't have much time. But I decided to come write this post, and share this method, because I know what it's like to believe and hope and not be able to be or have what you want. After being sick, this was my biggest desire. To finally be normal, like everyone else. And i couldn't. This was the only thing, that gave me confidence, success and freedom for the rest of my life. So this is especially for people, who I see in the posts need this most.*

# The Real Problem: How Limiting Beliefs Are Running the Show

Let’s get one thing straight: **Your subconscious mind doesn’t care about your goals and dreams.** 

It cares about **keeping you safe**. First and foremost our brain is a survival mechanism, designed to watch the news and find out the potential danger or the bad thing that can happen.

This is KEY fact most people don't know:  *Your brain can’t distinguish between potential* ***physical danger*** *and potential* ***emotional danger.***

If your desires have even the slightest *potential* of emotional danger (rejection, failure etc.) and feel even remotely threatening, your subconscious will block out all the information that would help you GET THERE and instead mental blocks, negative thoughts and emotions - sabotaging you every. Single. Time.

Think about it:

* **You can want 1 million dollars -** but if that means there's a potential to *‘be rejected by your close friends’, ‘judged by others’, or ‘appear bad... or greedy in the eyes of others’* \- the mind knows that, and it will block all possible information, that would help you get there and make that 1 million.
* **You can want your ex back -** but your subconscious can see the potential of being left and abandoned again... betrayed... and the pain of being alone being on the other side... so it creates fear and invisible barrier, to prevent you from sending that message - creating conflict from what you want - and how you actually feel.

Every one of these fears and limiting beliefs are rooted in your **past experiences (memory).**

Your brain isn’t sabotaging you. It’s protecting you.

Your subconscious is designed to keep you in alignment with what feels “safe.” And if you haven’t rewritten your limiting beliefs, it will filter out any opportunities, ideas, or actions that would bring you the things you want.

This is why people “try everything” and nothing works. They are focusing on the things outside, without seeing how their inside - beliefs - are creating their thoughts, emotions, behaviors, intentions, words and actions = *all manifesting energies, attracting their corresponding reality.*

**All these fears and limiting beliefs don’t come out of nowhere.** They’re rooted in our childhood.

‎

# How Our Childhood Creates Limiting Beliefs

Here’s the kicker: **Your current reality is a reflection of your past beliefs and memories.** Pre-determining your future experiences **- Fate.**

And for most people, they are entirely invisible. Because most methods, approaches, gurus or even therapists often focus on the *'outside work'.*

The problem is these beliefs are **inside**. They're about internal experiences.

Let’s break it down:

* **Shame:** That time your parents give love to your sibling or a neighbor kid, and by comparison you feel that if you are worse than others or not good enough = you might not get love... or even worse - you can be the one who gets left and can't survive...
* **Guilt:** Remember those times your parents punished you for doing something bad? Remember what happened when you got a BAD grade? Remember how society and movies show you what happens if you are BAD? And often... people with money = are 'bad'..
* **Fear of Rejection:** Remember how it feels, when you cry and your parents got upset at you. Simply for being - the way you are? And when the first time it was hard to make friends and somebody excluded you? Or that if you don't match expectations, they will turn on you?
* **Fear of Failure:** What about our parents expectations? What happened if we failed to meet them? Didn't we get punished? Wasn't it painful, to do something not the way we are supposed to do? What about getting a bad grade in school? Failing in class?

**Your subconscious mind is like a GPS.** It’s programmed with all the data from your past — good and bad. Pleasureful and painful. And it’s using that data to navigate your future. With every laser focus experience you are focusing in on (eliminating the rest), creating your perception... thoughts... emotions... and expressions. They shape your circumstances and places you go to.

So, if you’re trying to manifest something that doesn’t align with your subconscious programming, it’s like trying to drive to New York with your GPS set to Los Angeles. You’re not going to get there, no matter how many times you say, “I’m in New York!”.

This is how most people approach manifestation. Which is why they never get to their big destinations.

They never addressed the GPS! Which controls your manifesting energies - *thoughts, words, actions, intentions* and the *circumstances* they lead you to.

**‎**

# Why This Works (And Affirmations Don’t)

Here’s the truth: most people only manifest small things because of the **placebo effect**.

When you first learn about affirmations or scripting, it’s exciting. It’s **new**.

1. You expect it to work, and because 2) you’re actively looking for proof, you find it — thinking *'it works!'* just like a sugar pill can cure symptoms of an illness, **if you Believe it will**.

This is why ALL medical research is tested against this *Placebo effect* and **Belief**. The most powerful thing that can even cure physical illness.

But what happens then, for most people?

Reality sets in.

Because when you try to manifest something *big* — potential of failure, making a mistake, conflicting with strong memory imprints — you hit a wall. Whether you try and fail after first attempt. Procrastinate. Your mind always **shuts it down** before it even begins.

The resistance is so big, that after few failures - most people quit.

You see, affirmations, visualizations and other techniques (for most people) do not address - how beliefs and memories get created in the first place. Beliefs simply do not change, from saying empty words. Words do not imprint. Why?

Our subconscious mind needs **Evidence. Experience.**

This is how ALL of our memories, emotions and beliefs are stored in our subconscious mind. Think about it. Every time you feel 'I'm not confident', you have a REASON. And experience that happened, which became proof for that thought (belief). If I asked you why you think so, you would say 'xyz' reason, and things that happened. Which made you believe it.

The QPH Method, on the other hand, taps into your brain’s **Reticular Activating System (RAS)** — the part of your brain that controls what you see and focus on - allowing you to choose what you want to experience. Unlike affirmations, finding real *evidence*, that becomes *emotional experience* inside the body - energy, that is required to *rewire neuronal pathways.*

This is what allows you to create a belief of being confident, and then your RAS begins to see ONLY that. Finding evidence and experiences, where you did appear confident. Making you feel good and strong. Giving you a REASON to believe that you are that!

And this method helps you achieve it as simply and as fast as saying affirmations. But actually creating real, permanent subconscious transformation in just 21-30 days! If you have self-awareness, the changes can be seen even in weeks if not days.

You never have to say empty words or “fake it till you make it.”. It’s about *becoming it,* so you don’t have to fake anything.

‎

# Who This Is For (And Who It’s NOT For)

Let’s be real: **Not everyone is ready to take responsibility for their reality.** It’s easier to blame the universe, your ex, or your circumstances than to do the inner work. Passing away responsibility to outside world, or 'things are happening to me'...

Most people aren’t ready to hear this. They want to believe manifestation is about “high vibrations” and “acting as if.”. The magic pill - do nothing and get it now. They’ll keep chasing techniques while wondering why nothing is changing. Never looking deeper.

The mind even blocks many people from seeing the truth.

*...it would imply many of the faults... failures and pains... are = 'my fault'*

But in reality. They are not your fault. Because you never had the choice, for what circumstances you will have early in your life. Which will program your mind.

I never had a choice, to not experience losing my dad at the age of 6, and how that will affect my fear of rejection, approach anxiety, identity, jealousy in relationship, manifesting a breakup... Growing up my mom couldn't give me money for lunch when I saw everyone else have some. I continued on a similar path and struggles in my mid 20's, living from paycheck to paycheck, in debt. Until I changed my programming.

Now I can never have the same struggles with rejection, dating, jealousy or relationships. I can meet anyone I want. I send my mom monthly checks so she has more than her pension each month. I changed all of that in a very short amount of time... my life reshaping itself, right in front of my eyes.

As I’ve tested this belief change method over and over, for over a decade now, with 10,000+ beliefs that I changed for myself and others, it has never not worked.

The people who actually shift their reality are the ones willing to go deeper. They’re the ones willing to take responsibility, undo their past programming, and take control of their future experiences.

If you’re ready to break free from the cycle of small wins and finally create the life you want, then this is how you can start.

‎

# The Method That Actually Allowed Manifesting BIG Things (Step-by-Step Process)

I call it **The QPH Method**. It’s a simple, 3-step process that rewires your subconscious mind so you can finally manifest the big stuff. If you’re tired of small manifestations and ready to break past your limits, here’s what you have to do:

‎

# Step 1: Identify the Beliefs Keeping You Stuck

This is the harder part. Because most of us are born and told that the world is outside of us. So we keep living in it, without seeing the connection of how each thought connects to emotion, which connects to our experiences outside.

The goal is to develop awareness of your subconscious thoughts and inner chatter arising -> and begin to observe the internal experiences -> and what circumstances they brin us to. Because often, these internal experiences, when they are negative, they have specific themes. That create our desires.

Our **thoughts, emotions and desires** give us hints on what we may believe or find Painful, that is not benefiting us. When we begin to see and identify these patterns, that's when we can change our *Wants* into *Have's* and our *pains* into *pleasures*.

Best book that opened my eyes to this proccess is *'The Power of Positive Thinking'* \- By Norman Vincent Peale. Which is NOT about positive thinking. It's about noticing subconscious thoughts and their connection manifesting our reality outside of us.

*\*Another huge thing that happened for me accidentally, was I was drinking Ashwagandha root extract as a supplement. Back then I didn't know what it really does. I thought it was to reduce stress. But Ashwagandha has the power to sensitize every single cell in the body, and open up receptors - basically allowing to think faster, clearer - every thought is more vivid, every experience is more apparent, every imprint is stronger and easier. And many people who struggle with self-awareness, or 'seeing change', I found that ashwagandha helps activate this ability.*

After you know what it is you WANT (the lack) or what emotion you want to move away from - you have to find the exact opposite of it.

‎

# Step 2: Use the Law of Polarity to Find Proof of Its Opposite

**Your subconscious mind can’t hold two opposing beliefs at once.** In Psychology this is called Cognitive Dissonance.

If you find proof that your desired belief is already true, the old belief ceases to exist *- automatically.*

For example, if you think *'I want confidence'* it means you don't have it right now. By implication.

But when you think I have confidence, you can no longer want it. Because it's something you have.

How do you find evidence and proof, that you have it already?

‎

# Step 3: Ask a Focus-Shifting Question

Your brain filters reality based on what you **focus on**. Most people focus on what’s missing. That’s why they stay stuck.

Remember the famous quote in the Bible?..

It's also in the Quran... and other religious scriptures....

And it's there fore a reason. Because Gods greatest power, instilled into everyone of us, including You - was inside of you all along.

>*''ASK and you shall RECEIVE''* \- **The Bible (Christian Bible), Matthew 7:7-8**

>*''ASK me and I shall GIVE you''* \- **The Quran (Islam Bible), Surah Ghafir: 60**

>*''CALL to Me and I will ANSWER you.''* – **The Tanakh (Jewish Bible), Jeremiah 33:3**

Our brains Reticular Activating System, which controls our focus, based on all beliefs and memories in our subconscious mind, can consciously be controlled, by - *asking questions.* Psychology experiments have proven, that human focus expands. And often when we look for things, we can find them - *even if they are not there.* Our minds begin to identify anything relatively close, to what we look for.

>The second part of the verse is - *''Seek and you will find''* \- **The Bible, Matthew 7:7-8**

When you ASK a question, your mind goes into your subconscious, and finds - an ANSWER *(receives)*. That answer becomes evidence, which we experience. Creating energy and emotion, that travels into our brain to form new neuronal pathways. And by law of Polarity, naturally replacing exact polar opposite beliefs.

*\*When I discovered The QPH Method, I didn't see it through the eyes of religion. I lost faith and belief at the time. I relied on my Medical degree with Advanced Psychology and dozens of books that I've read. But later I realized, that my discovery and understanding, is like a new human ability, which is literally - a god given superpower. To change and control your reality and pre-determined fate.*

So what do you do? Ask yourself *1) Positive 2) Assumptive* **question** for a belief you want to have:

* *“How successful am I?”*
* *“How loved am I?”*
* *“How confident am I?”*

That's when you actually go from *'I WANT to be confident'* (implying that I am not confident right now)

To *'I am confident'* (Through the Universal Law of Polarity = replacing *wanting*, with *having*)

And you’ll begin to see and notice experiences where you *are* these things. Over time creating more evidence, more experiences for what that  belief represents in your mind.

You no longer have to try and CONTROL you thoughts and emotions. They change naturally, as a consequence of what you believe, see and experience.

But the important next step, is to make a belief unbreakable ***- permanent.***

You have to make it a habit, so that it finds evidence for you, subconsciously *- for the rest of your life.*

‎

# Step 4: Reinforce It Daily Until Your Subconscious Accepts It

Unlike affirmations, this method forces your brain to accept the new belief as reality. The more you find proof, the more your subconscious energy pathways change. In **30 days**, this becomes your new default reality.

1. **Polarity:** Focus on what you *have*, not what you want (lack).
   * Example: Instead of saying, “I want to be confident,” assume, “I am confident.”
   * Why it works: Your brain can’t focus on two opposites at once. When you focus on having, you automatically eliminate wanting.
2. **Question:** Ask assumptive questions that direct your focus.
   * Example: “How confident am I?” or “How good does it feel to make money?”
   * Why it works: Questions control your focus. And your focus creates your reality.
3. **Habit:** Repeat this process **for 30 days** to make it permanent.
   * Why it works: Your brain rewires itself through repetition. After 30 days, the new belief becomes automatic.

‎This is the QPH Method that I discovered. That worked for over a decade for me, without ever failing. With 10,000+ different beliefs I changed for myself and others. And it has not failed once.

*\*Self-Awareness is KEY - whether you'll see change, or not see it and continue to live in the outside awareness. The change always happens. 100% of the time.*

‎

# The Hard Truth: This Isn’t a Quick Fix

Here's the reality of beliefs: **You have dozens of subconscious beliefs.** Changing ONE doesn’t magically change your life.

For example you can create a belief of being confident. It doesn't automatically eliminate past painful associations of - *rejection, guilt* etc. The deeper, core beliefs, that are tied to our deepest desires and emotions.

Also, if you ask a question *'How am I a millionaire?'* it doesn't work, because the mind can't see an answer, of something you have never seen. It's not familiar. This is where visualization can help. To create a MEMORY of something that hasn't happened yet. And when it becomes strong enough - it has to reflect inside reality - ***outside.***

**Affirmations were never intended to manifest** these types of things. Since their discovery, and even in Napoleon Hills books (studying Rockefeller, Ford, Edison etc.), affirmations were designed to help *reprogram limiting beliefs.* NOT manifest.

**Visualization** was intended to - imagine your *future, goals, desires, visions and dreams.* (If you notice, this is exactly how most people are manifesting - always)

The actual practice of manifestation if about consciously using *visualization/imagery* for conscious, strong memory imprinting. Visualizing once is the same as asking a question once. It doesn't work. It needs that experience, to become so real, that the mind no longer *Wants*, and recognizes it *Has.*

But childhood... *beliefs*... are what allows some people to visualize and manifest millions, and for others - remain a dream, and a daily practice, without arriving to those dreams.

When I overcame my limiting beliefs, I never had to rely on any other method. I just go and get what I want, without anything standing in between. Without any emotion blocking me. And I produce results, outcomes and creations.

If you want to manifest the life you never had, you have to work to undo the life you had - the difficult childhood... the bullying in school... the familiar reality of seeing parents struggle and feel pain when there's not enough money... the pain we felt when our parents couldn't afford a toy for us or a chocolate... the pain we saw on TV when we saw 'The pursuit of happiness' and the immense deep pain and emotional danger to be poor, to fail, to not have enough, to not be able to provide = and empathized with it... to where it became our association of failure *equals* pain.

These experiences created our beliefs. And those beliefs are manifesting our life experiences. Inside and outside.

But here’s the good news: **Now you can change them. You have a choice.**

**‎**

# Final Thought

Manifestation isn’t magic. It already inter-connects with science. The double slit experiment. The rice experiment nobody could believe, tried it and was miraculously repeating on YouTube. The power of our consciousness is directly connected to the physical world.

To gain control of this proccess, It’s simply about understanding how your mind works, how your beliefs create reality and circumstances - and **using that knowledge to create the life you want.**

If you’re tired of settling for small wins and ready to finally break through, the power is in your hands.

Now - **It's your choice.**",3,1739818241.0,limitingbeliefs,2,1.0,False

1irrf1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/vermicompost/comments/1irrf1f/reigniting_the_worm_leachate_debate/,Reigniting the worm leachate debate,"Confession, my worm bin, a Tumbleweed Can O Worms with 3 levels, produces plentiful leachate and I use it on my houseplants diluted by 3-4x.

I understand from some people that this is terrible (both producing it and using it). I had hesitated using it the first time, but it had been infiltrated by so many castings that it seemed like a waste to just throw it away. 

So I put it on an umbrella plant and the thing exploded with shiny new leaves. Then I tried it on my 4 orchids and EVERY one came out with triple spikes loaded with huge blossoms (the most I had ever gotten previously was a single spike). My amaryllis bulbs also rebloomed with gigantic flowers. 

I’ve been using it since and the results are consistent. My plants LOVE this stuff. 

Is there something about the particular conditions of my worm bin that give me a different result from the people reporting this stuff is toxic? Some details: 

1. We eat and grow organic so that’s what the (red wriggler)worms get. Shredded cardboard and unbleached egg cartons for bedding, a large variety of fruit and veg, coffee grounds, eggshells and occasional stale bread (homemade organic whole grain sourdough). 

2. The bin has 3 levels - the top is typically the active feeding level, the second is finished or close to finished castings and the bottom is where the leachate collects. I rotate and harvest maybe every two months. 

3. The design of the worm bin allows the worms to move freely to whatever level they like via ramps and holes. I find them on all 3 levels. Interestingly that includes in the bottom level where I find large numbers taking “baths” in the leachate. I do scoop them up and move them to an upper level but there are always large numbers congregating regardless. 

4. The bottom level is aerated with air holes at the top of the “legs” that support the bin. So it’s not anaerobic. 

5. I collect the leachate through a tap at the bottom level. Sometimes a few worms slip out with it and I water them into the plants too. They seem to survive as I’ve encountered worms when I repot. 

6. The worm population appears very healthy. I’d guess there are several thousand worms, with knots of worms in every spoonful. They consume about 2 kg of scraps every week. I once put almost a whole organic sourdough loaf that had gone bad in there, thinking I was doing a bad thing. But a week or so later, it was completely gone. 

7. The instructions with the bin said to flush it with water every week or so but I don’t bother anymore as plenty of leachate is produced without it. The bin does get a lot of watery scraps like melon, watermelon, cucumber, tomatoes.

We have a nice fountain in the middle and places around it - D's greenhouse and tree, N's little house and basketball court, a coffee shop, and we were discussing what to add to it between those structures because the space felt empty.

So I said that we could put a flower shop next to the coffee shop and maybe something else on the other side, and maybe after we get more used to being a system (N and D are both about a month and a half old) we could make a tulpa and that will be their space in the headspace.

And as I said that, immediately, I got a vivid image of a girl with two ginger braids wearing overalls and boots, got a name, and she talked to us.

So I started panicking, D took me to the side and calmed me down and asked the new girl to wait for us inside the flower shop, and I'm just trying to make sense of it all.

D says I can let her stay in the flower shop for now, and if she's already conscious she's allowed to come out and talk to us, and of not we could go in there when I'm ready.

At the same time I was also thinking about if someone ran the coffee shop, and a vague image of a person again came to mind, but it's a shared space mostly me and N use and that form didn't move or talk or get a name is is now just kinda sits behind the counter at the coffee shop and I also don't know what to make of that??",3,1739818073.0,Tulpas,4,1.0,False

I feel like the information in this sub has really prepared me for what to expect.

I am 10 years post-RNY gastric bypass. I was 425 lbs. at my heaviest before the bypass, and my lowest weight post-bypass was 255 lbs. My starting weight before Compounded Semaglutide was 345 lbs. (yes, I regained 90 pounds), and my current weight three weeks into treatment is 333 lbs. My provider is hims, and I’m still on the introductory 0.3mg dosage.

I also think it’s important to note that I am diagnosed with adult ADHD, and I think the dopamine deficit that causes has driven food addiction throughout my life.

First, the good: 
* For me, _the “food noise” stopped within 30 minutes of my first shot_ of compounded Semaglutide. This was remarkable to me, because dopamine seeking food cravings have been a fact of life for me.
* I had prepared myself for serious gastric symptoms, but _have only suffered some mild constipation that is easily managed_ with bulletproof coffee (using coconut oil instead of butter), and/or adequate hydration.
* _I’ve lost 12 pounds_ in three weeks! I can breathe easier, and my back doesn’t hurt as often!

Now, the downsides:
* _Nausea_. I definitely dealt with it for the first two weeks. Luckily I have some ondansetron left over from a run-in with Norovirus last year, and a single tablet has been able to address this symptom. The nausea has only lasted for one or two days after the shot, and is not constant. I’ve learned to take the shot before bed, which seems to further minimize nausea. 
* _Gas & bloating_. I am experiencing both, but I’m hoping to address these with dietary changes. If they continue to remain a problem, I will try an enzyme medication like Beano. Discomfort from this has been completely within tolerance for me.
* _The effects wear off_. Granted, I am literally on the first-level introductory dose, but the food noise starts to turn back up around the end of day four. I am not worried about this as of yet, because I have two dosage increases planned with hims. I also may consider splitting the dose in half, and taking the first part on Saturday night, and the second part on Wednesday night (others in the sub have remarked that this worked for them).
* _It’s easy to over-eat to the point of sickness_. I honestly didn’t expect this, because of the RNY. I know that one of the primary effects of compounded Semaglutide is a slowed digestive process, but given that I have a stoma instead of a sphincter connecting my stomach to my small intestine, I thought this would not be much of a problem. _Wrong._ It is almost like going back to the first year post-RNY. I can eat 1/3 to 1/2 of my average meal. If I go overboard, I’m in danger of throwing up (yeah that happened twice before I became much more cautious).

So far, *I am very happy with my results*, and excited to continue the medication. Again, thank you all for sharing your experiences. If there is interest, I will provide another update in four or five weeks.",0,1739818049.0,CompoundedSemaglutide,1,0.5,False

I have had a situationship/friendship with an Indian man (important for the context - I am caucasian) for about 2 years. We are good friends, he confides in me, I get advice from him and we hook up but we've never had true sex. I won't do that without us being in a committed relationship, which he is clear that he doesn't want. 

I get a lot of breadcrumbs, and I enjoy our time together mostly. He went to India for 6 weeks and came back and we've barely seen each other. When he returned last year we spent a lot of time together. We spent basically all of 2024 together. I asked if he got engaged or slept with someone and he seemed very offended. None of his friends know of my existence. His family doesn't know of my existence. 

He is stressed about work and his visa, and I had thought we would get together this past weekend. We didn't. I said I was feeling disconnected, and that we don't spend time together anymore. He didn't reply. He has a coffee maker of mine and I said I would stop by late this week to pick it up. He said there is something wrong with the way that I think, and replied to my message about spending time together and said that I have no clue what he is going through in his life and if I think that way then he is sorry. I told him we should talk because texting isn't fruitful and I care about him and I want to understand.

I am really struggling with how to proceed with my wife.  Every interaction with me is met with defensiveness.  She is completely checked out of our marriage aside from the day to day things that need to be done.  Says that she does not care to work on our marriage or relationship until she figures out what she wants out of life, or figures out how to be happy with the life she has made.  She still refuses to further address her hormones before her next appointment in April. So frustrating because I see it clear as day, she needs an estrogen patch badly. Its to the point where she barely wants any interaction with our children. Logic says that if your hormones have brought you to this mid life crisis, then addressing your hormones is going to help bring you out of it. How you can find joy in your life or make any rational decisions about your life if your messed up hormones are the dominating the narrative? 

Nothing has really changed. She is still extremely withdrawn from me. She is still in a mid-life crisis about being unfulfilled in her life. She doesn't want to engage with me as a husband and partner. We've had discussions about how I feel like I just don't have a partner in this marriage anymore. She said that me and my needs are just too much right now.  She only says that she has to work on herself, and come to terms with the life she has made. Her mood swings and irritability are at an all time high, being on Progesterone only isn't cutting it. She talks about our life as though everything is a burden on her, and that its never going to change or get better. She acts like she is a victim of her own circumstances. Instead of doing the hard work and facing these life stressors head on and finding a way to make them more manageable. 

I've asked her to think about and lets explore how we make our life better, what does that look like to her. Nothing about our situation is written in stone, there are no bad ideas. Do we switch up our routine to allow more free time on the weekends, do we switch up the kid's swim lesson's schedule to make it in the middle of the week instead of Sundays?  Do we need to plan a small family getaway for spring break here in a couple months? Does that look like a weekly outing to a new restaurant on Saturdays regardless of what the kids will eat? Just to have something new to look forward to. Does she just need one day a week where she isn't involved with us at all?  She instead takes every opportunity to run from her problems, shields herself away, withdrawl.  She takes every opportunity she can to escape our family. She just spent this past Saturday going to her friend's daughters cheer-leading competition for the day. They went to lunch prior to the competition, and then spent the next 4 hours waiting to watch her friend's daughter's squad do their 6 minute performance, then spent another 2 hours chatting at a coffee shop.  I don't begrudge her spending time with her friends.  But she had the audacity to tell me not to take our 2 daughters out to do something fun because it only reinforces that dad is the fun parent.  I told her that is you problem, you want to go off and tag along with your girlfriend for the day and do her family activity that's your choice. We aren't going to sit around here and do nothing to protect your feelings of inadequacy. So I took our kids to see a movie they were really wanting to see in the theater. 

I have a strong feeling that at some point she is going to ask me for a break. Now what that means, I am not sure. Is it is a separation? Is it sleep in separate bedrooms and just be co-parents for a while? That seems very unproductive. I'm not sure how I would respond to this type of request.  Heck for the most part it fills like a break already, she spends most her free time and nights shut in our room, reading books, journaling, trying to connecting with her spirit guides, talking to all her friends about her and our problems.   I am not sure I could grant an actual separation when she hasn't even addressed her hormones, or even tried couples therapy.  Her counselor even offered to start having us come in for a few sessions as a couple to which I would be totally down for.  She told her no that she wasn't ready to discuss our marriage issues before she works out what she wants out of life. I want to be like sorry dear, you don't get to quit when you haven't done anything to address your issue.  But that's a potential problem for a future me. 

On a positive note I have been working very hard at being a good listener and holding space, and being empathetic when she talks about things in hopes that she will begin to share things with me again. I wasn't not a in good place in my own life 6 months ago when she shared with me that she was going through perimenopause and in a mid-life crisis. I certainly did some damage there in my ability to be a safe space for her to share things.  This past week on Friday she shared with me that she is really getting into a more spiritual journey and trying to connect to her spirit guides, recognizing signs from the universe vs coincidences. Tapping into energy, astrology, taro cards. That type of stuff.  Things she was kind of into before we met, and even led her to me.   It was a good and fascinating conversation, I actually began to get watery-eyed in the middle of it because I seen just how excited she was with all this stuff, and I seen a spark of joy there that hasn't been present in awhile.  I told her it was all very interesting, and I was happy that she has found something to dig into like this.  I don't judge her on it as I believe that type of spiritual genre just is just as valid as being a Christian. I'm pretty agnostic, people just need a belief system to help them cope with the harsh realities of life and that's fine by me.  But I was very happy that my work to be more emotionally safe has paid off and she is opening more towards me. It pains me greatly that my wife did not see me as safe to open up to and be vulnerable with. 

I have been spending my time working on myself too, as I was at an all time low point in my life last year dealing with a chronic medical issue that spiraled out of control and needed surgery. It certainly took the wind out of my sails for the past year and now that I am fully recovered, I am reclaiming my own life as well. I've lost 25lbs in the past 3 months through fasting and weight training, and feeling great about myself and just starting to reinvest time in my own happiness.  When you spend the majority of a year in chronic pain, you get to the point where you just can't show up in your life outside of the minimum effort required to make it through the day.  Once that pain was gone, you realize just how terrible your existence was.  I have been doing alot of self reflecting about my mental state during that period and giving myself alot of self compassion for what I went through; as I couldn't give myself any compassion while in the throws of it.  Yes I got super insecure over all this 6 months ago.  The menopause, lack of affection, no sex, a sudden change in our relationship.  But that insecurity doesn't define me, anybody in my situation would have gone through some major insecurity or panic after your spouse drops a bomb in your lap that threatens your emotional safety net when your just trying to survive. Everybody goes through insecurity, and I have been doing daily affirmations about what I know is true in my life. What type of man I am, what bring to a relationship, the type of father I am, the type of partner I am, how I show up in a relationship. All the wonderful things that make me the man I am.   I could easily choose to believe in the negative thoughts and allow that insecurity to take over again, and most assuredly behave in a manner that would drive her away completely.  Or I can change my perspective and change my life.  I know she loves me, I have all the evidence to support that, hell just the other day she came out down the hall way in her bathrobe to grab something before hopping in the shower, and I cheekily requested that she flash me to which she gruffed, and turned around gave me peek. So I know she isn't done with us. She feels trapped in her life, she actually isn't.  She has her own accounts, she has plenty of money, she could leave anytime she wants. Probably has had those thoughts too.  But she didn't. She has chosen to stay thus far, and not completely destroy our marriage over her hormones and mid life crisis behaviors.  Even though she has all these destructive and intrusive thoughts, all this irritability and frustration toward me and how her life has turned out, making some extremely questionable choices that are like self sabotage. It must mean that she also has a deep love for me, and for our family that overrides all this stuff. Sometimes the crazy stuff wins the battle for the day, but if I want win the whole war. I gotta lean into that deep love, give her the space she needs, love her from afar, support her when its needed, sometimes just go with the flow, and most of all don't react to the crazy.   That don't mean be a push over, stand up for yourself when a boundary is crossed, but just don't match her crazy emotions with your own crazy emotions.  Set your expectations for what you need, and ask her to honor them when she can. 

 If I I am able to do that then we'll probably be alright on the other side of this.  If she decides that she's done with this life and marriage or does something unforgivable like any type of infidelity, then I win either way as I know i will have done right by my own soul, and will be free to find the life I couldn't find with her.  There is plenty of equity in our house value, and everything would have to be split down the middle anyways so its not like I am in any danger of having to start over life with nothing, and the kids would have to be 50/50 anyways.  It would suck, and definitely not something I would want and would fight like hell to avoid it, but if that is reality then so be it.

My budget is $1600-$2000, and I’m hoping to live in lower Manhattan, but I can be flexible with the location.

I’m very clean, quiet, and friendly, and I would love to be friends with my roommates as well. I really enjoy going to concerts, thrifting, getting coffee, working out, baking, and making art. I don’t have any pets, but I love animals if you have any!

I’m also open to moving into a room if you’re looking for another roommate in your apartment.

What I’m hearing is a few different stories. 

1st night some Dudes brought a hot plate out at 4am made coffee and sat in line waiting for the show. Made some new friend in line from NY, Chilled for hours.  Then around 10am some women showed up screaming their chairs were moved? 
And demanded they were in the front of the line???????

How can you go sleep in your van or wherever and think that’s holding your place in line? 
What is wrong with people?

Sunday…..
A friend was in line at 6 am, counted her spot (give or take 20 people)
She would have been about 50 back in line. 
When they handed out numbers she was like 110
About 50 wooks came outta the woodwork?
How does that happen. 

I even heard some guy slept there and didn’t even get a number.

What’s going on with this number system???????
I also like they’re picking random numbers to go first. At least that shakes it up a little. 

Everyone would like a chance to get to the front or as close as possible

1irr1kh,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1irr1kh/creating_a_list_of_specialty_coffee_beans_for_b2b/,Creating a list of specialty coffee beans for b2b [Help],"Hey Guys,

Right of the bat, we run a small family business out of Kolkata and deal in Tea, Coffee & Snacks vending machines. But I am not here to sell anything to you. I made this post to validate some of the coffee beans that all of you in this sub recommend. The thing is we cater to Offices, Cafes etc and sell Lavazza, Continental Coffee (and the likes) beans to them but I want to bring in the specialty coffee movement in this space as well. Cause when you cater to the masses, you have to take some responsibility of moving it towards the right direction! 

Our core idea is to offer a range of specialty coffee beans:

* priced below Rs.1000/kg (including gst & delivery) 
* one option for black, one for milk coffees (ideal would be a blend that works for both)
* available all through the year (consistent supply with stable prices)

From whatever I have read in the sub so far here are the options that meet the above criteria:  Hunkal Heights Aranya Gold

* Panduranga Mysore Nuggets
* Mokkapot 80:20
* Malakodu Single Estate Arabica
* Hunkal Heights Aranya Gold

But these are all 100% arabica which means more suited to black coffees and espressos. Can you guys please enrich this list with more options for Black & Milk Based drinks and rank them based on your experience.

Once I have this list final, my plan is to get in touch with these estates and start sourcing these the beans which we will then use to sell to our b2b customers. Hopefully if all goes well, one day when you go to office, you won’t have to drink CCD. 

Thanks a lot. ",2,1739817307.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False
1irr1iw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tipstor/comments/1irr1iw/do_i_look_like_i_have_time_to_marinate/,“Do I Look Like I Have Time to Marinate?”,"There are many things in life I’m willing to wait for — a good cup of coffee, an apology I’ll never get, or the day someone finally invents a self-cleaning kitchen. But marinating something for 24 hours? Absolutely not. If a recipe demands that kind of patience, it has already lost me. What kind of life do these recipes think I’m living? One where I plan my meals days in advance like some sort of highly organized, self-disciplined person? That’s adorable. The only thing I plan 24 hours in advance is the excuse I’ll use to avoid social interactions.

Imagine you’re starving and you find a recipe that looks incredible. The picture is mouthwatering, the description promises flavors that will transport you to another dimension, and you’re already picturing yourself devouring it in sheer bliss. Then, like a cruel joke, you scroll down and see those dreaded words — *marinate for 24 hours*. Excuse me? Do I look like someone who schedules my cravings a day in advance? By the time those 24 hours pass, I’ll have already eaten three meals, five snacks, and given up on cooking altogether in favor of something instant and regrettable.

And let’s talk about the logistics. The recipe acts like I have an entire refrigerator shelf just sitting empty, waiting to house a single bowl of raw chicken soaking in some magical elixir of flavor. News flash — my fridge is a war zone. Leftovers, questionable condiments, and a very suspicious block of cheese from an unknown era have already claimed their territory. There’s no room for a bowl of high-maintenance meat that demands a full-day spa treatment before it’s even cooked.

What truly gets me is the arrogance of these recipes. “Allow the flavors to deepen over 24 hours for the most exquisite taste.”Is that so? What happens if I marinate it for just 30 minutes — does it self-destruct? Will the food police burst through my kitchen window and demand to see my marination records? I refuse to believe that an extra 23 and a half hours is the difference between “delicious” and “inedible.” If something needs that much time to taste good, maybe it just wasn’t meant to be.

Don’t even get me started on the betrayal of remembering you were supposed to marinate something after you’re already hungry. “Oh, I forgot to start my 24-hour marinade yesterday,” said no normal person ever. The only appropriate response at that point is to abandon ship entirely and find a meal that respects the reality of human hunger.

So no, I will not be held hostage by a recipe’s ridiculous timeline. If a dish requires me to plan my life around it, then it has already failed me. I’ll be over here enjoying food that can be eaten within a reasonable amount of time — preferably before my stomach decides to stage a full-blown protest.

# 🔮 [IBM Teases a Future of Artificial Reasoning](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2025/02/artificial-reasoning-future/)

IBM has unveiled its latest advancements in artificial reasoning, hinting at AI systems capable of logical deduction and complex problem-solving beyond pattern recognition.

* “Basically, somebody figured out that if you said, ‘tell a model (to) think step by step,’ it actually produces better results,” Dr. David Cox, VP of AI models at IBM Research, told me. 
* “The model will actually take its time. It'll verbalize a few steps, and you'll get a better result in the end. And that's a very versatile thing to do. But if you just do that, then it has its limits,” he said. “It helps. But it's not life-changing.”

**And while the industry has been trending for months now** in the ‘reasoning’ direction, there was a definite shift in the wake of [DeepSeek’s release of R1](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.wZPohD0JH12EksCsbt8ZeFCsxgaiiSFhhEZXgbyLVQF20X7omZjut_Sqqt70fu4OtOV2RFnj1J0kuHROf2yuj6N8V81q27tXLUSmsdBp5AzAvOIO88ie_uNp2WRenb5z6IH1f1CDmRXBr858fEHSbaLFjRqX3X_0lhbhUzcCyj5jPm-w_-qDFk25MQwUqYKRAi7ZIcVbaIsAP3R4MpOoXRr1sEn1sUsfk9woG-L771gQAija8aBPCRCCsW48P-yQxZQg0MIffFDKmrI88dMllEQK2iTflRX2lG_9kXax4m7db3P53Td8q-MztfC5hEv28ASaC8MqOyIGFJSp-IL7CebbV_5D2noc3ZOgx-mCapbckg3-nzTyUm9eZviXE-OAS7rpkPmXsD3UG4iAoedeWJszf14c4moB6ht-m2dt6Cd1dGrXNRBKQ0v38n02Ra5iYj80WlB31PddUl3xmoosFGuP15ITkX9NtWQxe6FzwbSP7UBfJ8uKLf9zacXZOQQjtswEjNx4iNOkR-DgjMArAAQzqDxdPONuDlnyWUTDAaqIIb_1Ox7uYbhaGyV2NgdBzcThm_vBSHYXXKJ6WRuzRFIlrtjGB-b-aSXqJV2L_k9M3E9dLtnzGwh-aBfFuZDw-clCSWJyYbXyP37IgzfdQqf_exTCs81KO_EiIHMM6zIQ-7O_tr2xZ79rjY_ZMlnqw1XBrFsQkeJ2uaKnxaR7ozkrKJpZyjbDgt-BNi8Z5v4rWuEyqDucv666QZQ5vp6AK72uvGxJ6WlXwPPI5qW2IfFQ7NLVT3H2PRxBuQc7hAxvULUD2Q6TwoocfqmmyEcvhJfWhZk7oPunqgFknqoe6Q/4e3/otrlguRhTACTjGkAa3P76g/h19/h001.RITdLVjZFLhXRGVmmueTMKSWKh2uqz_ZymfNIpJQL7w), a seemingly cheaper model that achieved parity with OpenAI’s models through reinforcement learning and CoT reasoning. 

“Everyone had a really, really strong reaction to R1 coming out, which frankly confused us in the research field a little bit,” Cox said, explaining that DeepSeek, at least to those in the industry, didn’t exactly come out of nowhere. “We were already excited. We were already all working on it.” 

And rather than waiting to release it, IBM decided to “just get something out there to show what we’ve been doing in the space.”

# ⚖️ [Senate Passes Legislation Addressing Deepfake Porn](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/us/politics/senate-passes-deepfake-porn-legislation.html)

The U.S. Senate has passed a landmark bill targeting the spread of deepfake pornography, introducing stricter penalties for creators and distributors of non-consensual AI-generated explicit content.

* The Act would **criminalize the publication** of nonconsensual “intimate imagery,” something that explicitly includes “computer-generated” images and videos. It would also clarify that a person consenting to the creation of an image does not qualify as consent for the publication of said image. 
* It would additionally **require websites to remove** such content within 48 hours.

The bill was similarly unanimously passed by the Senate during the previous 118th Congress, but **never made it through the House.** U.S. representatives Maria Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.) and Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.) have already reintroduced companion legislation to the House. 

The bill’s authors noted the primary impetus behind this legislation, that though dozens of states have enacted laws that prohibit the publication of nonconsensual, explicit images, with some even addressing deepfakes by name, **the laws are wildly uneven,** something that leaves victims exposed. 

Cruz, calling for the House to pass the bill, [said](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.wZPohD0JH12EksCsbt8ZePKXXxAvFeElMIejYm4xsM7pOTOgDmHTtf1C9hR3ASIQGQdD4iNHuOgRdLI_7nRQZ_H4qodkfNC-JV_LfSOqGDBBI7S4VqvbMxubdK4yI1XKGOdHvD0qf8FDlrV8kPKXx--fxcBjZxbvns_2wvy77apkE5e-FVkej5wmGSHrDmH_UuvgOM-AYMMOSSfQF-z-_YHi_mUXc4_2hDKpzY2uCMBtwBMCo21UX7gSVpByPLsK3fnYvaP_RMs5Bcnyw7Fk_IDqY1lmbbjuWL5NHyQyxW9oJVTK1khmXSxMlZUr8EAhV-UWNSgEwLpf2cYwn3cebluQyhcdxhrdDbCWkkAdAie1myxMBeGxVhpLTt-JMA1WpfkZ7nY2GSX3VbAFeH4pyzfTSrgIOx2tvXQUC_wWSuk/4e3/otrlguRhTACTjGkAa3P76g/h9/h001.JRyhONDIS8r0B5Z092vdmgaOd2QDEYwtO0jQn5UhQRw) it would give “victims of revenge and deepfake pornography — many of whom are young girls — the ability to fight back.”

Some Context: I (36 F) am a fairly outspoken person but also a huge people pleaser. I often tone myself down to figure out how I can fit into a situation, which yes means I am not entirely authentic but I am working on it. The thought of people not liking my has plague my whole life and I go out of my way to make people like me. My now ex husband (40 M), lets call him Carter is similar in a lot of ways but his people pleasing goes so far that he will go completely silent and not talk to people for huge amounts of time and would only ever blow up with me. 

  
My dad lived in our basement at the time, my mom lived about an hour away and his dad and step mom (SMIL) lived 15 minutes away. We spent almost every weekend at my in laws house because we had a lot in common, had gotten over some early hurdles when they started dating and it was just a good time.

  
He proposed 2 times over our 10 years of dating and despite saying yes there seemed no rush to get married for either of us. In 2018 an old friend passed away and I spiraled, dying my hair, ready to quit my job, I just wanted to experience life and I felt stuck. 3 months later an ex boyfriend passed and I snapped too, or so I thought. Carter and I discussed wanting to move forward with getting married so we planned a BBQ to make it official and invited some friends and family to let them know we would be getting married a year from then. 

  
This is where things start to get hairy.

  
Everyone was happy for us and my mom and dad (separated) said they didn't have a lot financially but would help where they could. Carters dad and step mom also said they wouldn't be able to help financially but if there was anything they could do to help, they would. Although not contributing financially FIL insisted on inviting his siblings and their children despite Carter not being close with them and our attempt to keep the wedding small. This resulted in my needing to invite more of my family (I had originally planned on 1 cousin and 1 aunt because I have a massive family of well over 100 and I didn't want a large expensive lavish weeding.) Luckily my family was understanding that I couldn't accommodate everyone and we focused on the ones I grew up closest too and a few others. My parents did end up stepping up a little to help. My mom fell in love with a wedding dress that was way outside my budget and I wasn't budging so she paid for half, she also got party favors and desserts for us. My dad gave us a few thousand dollars that we knew he couldn't afford so we used some but gave most of it back.

  
We asked a few people to be a part of our wedding party and I started planning. I was not super set on anything. I was not the girl who grew up dreaming about the perfect wedding and I was more focused on keeping it cheap without looking cheap. During the planning the Best Man and his now wife decided to get married a few months before us (relevant I swear). Their wedding was thrown together by their family members and had some holes in the planning. The father of the groom who funded a huge portion (if not all of the wedding) was stuck manning the grill so my ex offered to take over so he could enjoy the wedding. I helped by keeping children entertained.

  
Leading up to our wedding I had chosen Brown for the guys and a soft pink for the girls in the wedding party. The Best Man complained that he had just bought a black one for his wedding and wanted to back out because he couldn't afford to buy another suite. Rather than argue or try to come up with options for him, I changed the guys colour to black. No big deal. 

  
A few weeks later my Bridesmaids were planning my bachelorette party and nothing was happening for my husband. I reached out to the best man and asked "" Have you guys started planning a stag for Carter?"" He flipped out and said ""I can't afford a bach party, I can't even afford a bottle of water."" I explained that we weren't expecting a trip to Vegas. Maybe a round of golf or go to a strip club. He just deserved for his friends to do something for him because he had done a lot for them. This went no where so I reached out to Carter's cousin who helped organize something that resulted in the Best Mans dad to take them all golfing then back to our house for poker, axe throwing and drinks. It really looked like a good time. Like I said Best Man dad paid for everything. 

  
At thins point Best man said he didn't think he should be best man and maybe just a groomsman. Our wedding wasn't super formal or traditional so the titles made no difference to anything. We get to the wedding day and not only was former best man not a groomsman, he didn't even show up or congratulate us because I was a bridezilla. There was one conversation about a bach party where he had a temper tantrum and aside from that I bent over backwards to accommodate him to my wedding. I have not spoken to the best man or his wife since the wedding.



Oh wait but there's more. Remember how I was mentioning our parents. Early in the process Carter and I were worried that his mom might attend. His mom was not present in his life, had serious issues with about a dozen or more guests and it was a legitimate concern. When we got ahold of her and told her about the wedding she opted out on her own accord and we showed her great appreciation.

  
My bridesmaids consisted of my best friend, my sister and his sister. The 3 of them and my mom went dress shopping. I invited my SMIL so she would feel included and when her daughter had gotten married in a different country the year before she was unable to attend so I felt like it was something she missed out on. She declined. We continued to spend almost every weekend at the in laws but I could feel something wasn't right. Conversations weren't being reciprocated, I was often left waiting for people alone. It was just off.

  
Carter and I thought it might because I wasn't trying to include her enough so I asked her to help me make a vail. She sews stuff for every holiday for gifts and this would take her maybe an hour and save me hundreds. She told me to go pick out a fabric and I asked her to come with me to the fabric shop to pick it out and she said sure. Months go by and we still haven't gone to the fabric store so I asked her to go with me on one of the weekends we were visiting. For reference, the fabric store was 5-10 minutes from their house. We could've done the errand in less than an hour. She told me to go get the fabric and she would ""throw something together for me"". I explained that I don't know the first thing about fabric and this would be a fun thing for us to do together and she agreed again. 

  
We are getting close to the date, about 3 or 4 weeks before the wedding and we still hadn't done it. I was having a stressful day because I still hadn't secured a DJ, the best man was being a pain in the ass and the SMIL wasn't helping me and I wasn't sure what to do but whine to my soon to be husband about it. Carter then decided to talk to his dad about it. Obviously emphasizing SMIL's part in my stress load and shit hit the fan. 

  
SMIL started calling me. I was at work and getting ready to go out with some friends so I declined her call and sent her message explaining I was busy getting ready for something and she lost it. I have lost the first half of the argument so I don't really remember how it started. I know she called me a bridezilla for making such a big deal out of something so small.  I didn't make a big deal about it, Carter, FIL and her did. She told me I wasn't family so I didn't have aright to have opinions about what was going on. For context Carter and I had been together 10 years, SMIL and FIL 5 years. I explained to her that I was the reason he and his dad were so close. I was the one suggesting we go over there all the time. I did so because I enjoyed SMIL's company. She continued to berate me and call me names so I told her she needed to lay off or she was going to drive a wedge between FIL and Carter. She took this as a threat. This was apparently me telling her I wouldn't let him spend time over there. I explained that he and I spend time together on weekends and if she and I are beefing we wouldn't be there as much. She accused me of trying to ruin FIL and Carter's relationship and saying she would never get in the way of that so how dare I? I explained that she had already driven a wedge between FIL and Carter's sister because she wont listen, is unable to respect boundaries and at this point sister in law was no contact with them. I had had enough but she continued to message me and I just responded with ""You're impossible"" then several messages just saying ""Bye"" Her last message to me was ""No problem you picked this fight so you could uninvite me. Like you said you can asked anyone. Your miserable not knowing if I'd come so you win be happy"" This resulted in a series of phone calls that involved all 4 of us and after being screamed at I finally went nuclear stating that SMIL better not show up and FIL better be there and I was definitely screaming like a banshee and losing my mind. I was so tired of something so stupid causing so much stress and it ruining everything. I had a feeling she would show up. The ceremony was in a public park only a 5 minute walk from their house so I couldn't do anything if she did.

  
We get to the wedding day and my bridesmaids noticed they were both there and decided to hide it from me. Honestly this was probably for the best because I was so mad I was ready to throw hands. I did not see her. They left before photos and Carter never even got a photo with his dad. I didn't even know they had been there until the reception when someone told me FIL had driven some of the cousins to the wedding and gotten in a minor collision in the parking lot.

  
The wedding went great. Had to kick out 1 guest for getting a little too drunk but it was a lovely evening. 

  
SMIL and I had 1 further interaction after this. FIL was in the hospital getting surgery early in the day. He got out of around 9 and called Carter around 10 am waking him up (he works nights) and gave him shit for not calling when he got out. Carter handled his dad and SMIL reached out to me to meet up. I wasn't hesitant but agreed, but as a precaution we met at a coffee shop and I recorded the conversation without letting her know.

  
I was anxious but went into the meeting somewhat open minded but if the wedding came up I wasn't leaving there without an apology or cutting things off for good. She started our conversation of with ""We could talk about the wedding but its in the past so lest move on. FIL is very disappointed that Carter couldn't be bothered to call him after his surgery and how I as a wife was responsible for making him be better at communicating with his family"" I hadn't seen either of them since the wedding and Carter had maybe seem his dad 3 times (its as if I predicted this would happen) I tried to explain to her that since the drama leading up to the wedding and how I was made to feel like I was not family, my opinions and feeling don't matter that it was no longer my responsibility and I would no longer be pushing Carter to make contact with his dad or not too. Now they will know that his actions are 100% his own. She accused me of being childish (30 years old at the time) I couldn't really get a word in so I stood up and said ""Have a good life"" and started to walk away. She yelled ""I should have known you couldn't have an adult conversation"" I yelled ""I shouldn't known you'd never be accountable for your actions and never saw or spoke to her again. I only ever saw FIL once, at a funeral and now that my marriage has ended I don't expect to ever see those toxic people again.

1irqurw,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1irqurw/attunement_going_wild/,"""Attunement"" going wild","Long rant/vent ahead, sorry

I'll try to write a short backstory first. Me (M49) and my Fiancee ""Aspen"" (F31) have been in an open relationship since we met six years ago. There have been challenges along the way but we've always faced them as a team and helped each other navigate things. At one point some odd three years ago she got involved with a guy that was clearly more than FWB but not ""in love"", but it ended before anything more developed. For the last 1 1/2 year I have been seeing my girlfriend (F29) ""Birch"" and things have become more complicated. This is the first time I have developed feelings for someone else and Aspen is having a hard time handling this. We've made progress and my and Birch's relationship has been able to develop during this to the point where we now love each other.

This isn't very much about Birch, though, but the backstory may prove to be useful. Because during all this hardships in dealing with anxiety, boundaries, jealousy and everything surrounding it, my and Aspen's relationship is being hurt. Well, not the relationship itself maybe, more in how we interact with each other. There is resentment, frustration and all those feelings that come from elongated discussions, fights and everything in between.

And now it has culminated in she storming out and sleeping at someone else and the culprit (to me) is the concept of attunement. Let me try to explain (while being very forward with this being my viewpoint, not the \*right\* viewpoint).

Like many in our position we read Polysecure, and in it there is a section with an acronym (HEART? I can't remember, sorry) with each letter being an important thing to think about when handling a poly relationship. This section was well written and the source for lots of interspection and fruitful discussion between us, but the section called ""Attunement"" is what I am focusing on now.

In short, if you haven't read it, attunement is about being mindful about your partners needs and wants, something inherently beautiful. For Aspen this became very significant - and I think it should be very significant - but I can't help but feel that it is being used against me. Let me explain with two examples (the latter being the one that led to her storming away):

1. In the car on our way home we talked about a subject, in that subject Aspen said something she felt was something sensitive and I missed it. I take full responsibility for missing this part or the importance of this part, my mind was on the subject at hand and it just didn't occur to me, not an excuse but an explanation. She got distraught and I asked her what she needs, and her reply was that she needs me to ""catch her"" in this feeling. She was on the brink of an anxiety attack and I tried to ask what she meant, what do you need me to do? This became an argument and I realized later in the discussion that this was an occasion where she would have wanted me to be ""attuned"" to her and take proper actions to meet her in her state.
2. I had a date with Birch this weekend (after having a wonderful valentines getaway with Aspen) and we ended the date back in our house with Aspen, played some games and went to be (Birch with me and Aspen in the guest room, as per the prior agreement between me and Aspen). The morning after was just coffee, breakfast and me suggesting that me and Birch play a video game and suggesting that Aspen join us in the sofa to feel included, this was for just 30 minutes until I was going to give Birch a ride to the train station. Before going away I noted how Aspen was being down and when I later got back from giving Birch a ride I said that I noted that she was down and asked her if the wanted to talk about it, no she didn't want to talk about it. Fine, I won't press her. I held her in the sofa, stroking her, asking her what she needs. She replied that this is one of those occasions where she doesn't want to tell me what to do and I should be proactive. This slowly turned into an disagreement and then a fight.

Now, if you're still reading (sorry), I want to say that I don't think ""being attuned"" isn't a valid need to have. I think it's a cornerstone of a loving relationship. I furthermore think we both \*are\* very attuned to each other in many aspects.

But, even so I don't think ""attunement"" should be an expectation or demand posed on your partner. I think it's fine to need it, cherish it and love it when you feel it, but it's also so wrong (in my head) to practically answer ""you should know what to do/say"" and then when I don't meet that need, it's a huge problem. Aspen has been clear about it not being something specific that I need to ""guess right"" just that I do \*something\* but I get stuck on this mystery box of instructions.

My need is clear communication, what do you need? I need to talk about X. Sure, let's talk about X. In my head this becomes ""What do you need?"" - ""You should know."" and then no more information.

I can admit to being stubborn or getting stuck in all the wrong places, but I just have this nagging feeling that her needs are just more important than my needs. And in this case we both have needs that are about the same thing - her being down and needing to land/talk about it. I want her to talk openly about her feelings and thoughts while (again, to me) she needs me to be ""attuned"" to her feelings and thoughts and be proactive about it. Again, I get the \*need\* for this, what I don't get is the black and white view that if am unable (or unwilling) to meet those needs, then this is a huge problem.

During the conflict I tried many times to open up, get closer to her (turning towards after conflict, polysecure) and was met with (almost) nothing. In the end, she still said her need is unmet and I got frustrated and she stormed away.

It's so frustrating and disheartening when these situations becomes a ""vs"" situation and both me and her won't budge. From my point of view (well duh) I feel I try my hardest to find a compromise, find a way to get closer and talk about the night before.

I'm just stuck in this feeling of I have to do something exactly right or it doesn't count at all. I am very open to being the asshole here and being stubborn, but I really needed to vent this and get someone elses view on this. Why is this such a struggle? What is your view on ""attunement"" and how it should be a part of a relationship, what is your view on my need for clear and open communication instead of \*only\* attunement?

I know most people have an order that they usually follow, but I'm really looking for reasons here and any evidence if possible.

1irqlxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/1irqlxd/blackberry_a_legacy_stock_thats_going_to_get/,BlackBerry: A Legacy Stock That’s Going To Get Re-Rated And Run,"BlackBerry is not a dead brand. It’s not a failed smartphone company. It’s not just another stock that spikes when retail traders pile in and then disappears.

It is a deeply entrenched, high-margin infrastructure software business that has gone completely unnoticed in the AI-driven rally. While every software stock remotely connected to AI, IoT, or automation trades at sky-high valuations, BlackBerry—which powers 255M+ vehicles and counting—still trades like a company with no future.

The reality is different. BlackBerry dominates real-time, safety-critical automotive systems with its QNX operating system, and it’s now layering on a SaaS-like business with IVY, a cloud-based vehicle data platform co-developed with AWS.

IVY allows automakers to process, analyze, and monetize vehicle sensor data in real time. This is exactly the kind of AI-adjacent, cloud-powered software business that should be trading at 10x revenue, yet the market assigns it zero value.

That will not last much longer.

* QNX is embedded in 255M+ vehicles and continues to expand at 20M+ per year.
* IVY has secured early adopters, including Foxconn’s MIH EV platform, Dongfeng, and Mitsubishi Electric.
* The cybersecurity division, generating $350M–$365M annually, is now stabilized and profitable.

Every other infrastructure software business with this kind of positioning has already been re-rated higher—this one just hasn’t caught up yet.

# The Trade: BlackBerry Gets Re-Rated in the Next 2–3 Quarters—Possibly as Soon as Earnings April 2nd

QNX is growing, IVY is ramping up, and cybersecurity has stabilized, yet the stock price still reflects none of this.

* If BlackBerry provides strong IVY guidance next earnings, the re-rating could start immediately.
* Even without IVY, QNX’s backlog alone justifies a higher multiple.
* Cybersecurity, previously a drag on performance, is now quietly generating cash.

This setup provides a margin of safety with significant upside.

Even if IVY takes time to scale, QNX alone is worth more than what the market is assigning to BlackBerry today.

If the market re-rates BlackBerry as an infrastructure software business, it trades at $12–$18 in the next 2–3 quarters. That does not include IVY guidance or it's potential impact on price, which could drive the stock much higher.

# QNX: The Operating System Running Inside 255M+ Vehicles

QNX is not an infotainment OS—it’s the real-time, safety-critical software running inside automotive systems.

* Installed in 255M+ vehicles, growing by 20M+ per year
* $815M backlog (+27% YoY) ensures forward revenue visibility
* Trusted by nearly every major automaker, including BMW, Toyota, Ford, GM, Volkswagen, Honda, Stellantis, Bosch, Continental, Magna, and Denso

QNX is embedded in ADAS, digital instrument clusters, telematics, and secure gateways—systems where failure is not an option. Automakers don’t replace this kind of software lightly, which is why QNX enjoys high retention and a long revenue tail.

As vehicles become more software-driven, QNX’s role is only growing.

* Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) require real-time OS solutions that QNX already dominates
* QNX Hypervisor enables multiple systems to run securely on a single chip, increasing its value per vehicle
* EVs and autonomous systems require low-latency, high-reliability computing—exactly what QNX provides

If QNX were valued like a strategic AI-driven infrastructure software provider, it would not be trading at 5x revenue.

A more appropriate 8–10x multiple puts QNX’s valuation at $2.5B–$3.5B alone.

Right now, the market is treating QNX like a legacy asset when it’s actually growing and gaining importance.

# IVY: The Unpriced SaaS Upside That Could Change the Entire Valuation

BlackBerry IVY is a co-developed vehicle data platform with AWS that allows automakers to process, analyze, and monetize in-car data.

* Foxconn’s MIH EV platform, Dongfeng Motors, and Mitsubishi Electric have already signed on
* IVY enables software-driven revenue streams for automakers (subscriptions, upgrades, real-time analytics)
* BlackBerry captures recurring revenue from these services

Right now, the market assigns IVY zero value because revenue has not yet scaled.

But automakers are moving toward Tesla-style in-car software features, usage-based pricing, and over-the-air upgrades.

If IVY becomes the data layer that enables this shift, BlackBerry’s valuation moves toward SaaS multiples instead of just embedded software.

And we will know a lot more by next earnings.

# Cybersecurity: No Longer a Drag, Now a Cash Generator

For years, BlackBerry’s cybersecurity business was bloated and uncompetitive.

* Then management sold off Cylance, cut unnecessary costs, and focused on high-trust, high-retention government and enterprise contracts.
* Cybersecurity now generates $350M–$365M annually with a $280M ARR & Margins have improved to 65%
* Trusted by NATO, Fortune 500s, and government agencies

This is not a high-growth business, but it is a stable, profitable enterprise software business that the market is ignoring.

Even at a conservative 2–4x revenue multiple, cybersecurity alone could be worth $700M–$1.2B.

Right now, the market is treating this business as worthless, which makes no sense.

# Market Mispricing: How Big Is the Upside?

BlackBerry is currently trading at \~5x sales, significantly below comparable infrastructure software businesses.

If the market re-rates BlackBerry as a legitimate infrastructure software provider, the stock is an easy double from here.

A reasonable valuation based on its components:

* QNX at 8–10x revenue → $2.5B–$3.5B
* Cybersecurity at 2–4x revenue → $700M–$1.2B
* IVY is completely unpriced—if it scales, it could be worth billions

**This pushes BlackBerry’s fair value toward $12–$18 in the next 2–3 quarters on the low end, $20+ on the high end if IVY scales.**

If IVY guidance is strong next earnings, that re-rating could start immediately.

# Final Thought: The Market Is About to Wake Up

This is not a meme stock revival.

It is an AI-adjacent, embedded infrastructure software business that has somehow escaped the AI stock rally.

That will not last much longer.

* QNX should not be trading like a no-growth legacy product
* IVY is being assigned zero value, despite real partnerships and revenue potential
* Cybersecurity is now a stable asset, not a liability

This stock is one strong IVY earnings guide away from a re-rating to juicy SAAS multiples. BlackBerry is almost certainly about to be priced like a great software company instead of a clown show. When that happens, it’s not trading anywhere near $5.69 anymore.

I’ve put together the above analysis of BlackBerry. I work on these memos for my own personal investments and want to start sharing them. Thought you degens might like them.

I'm going to be posting diligence on reddit regularly, but only on r/wallstreetbets for positions in my personal book. Follow me on directly if you want to read more.

**TLDR:** My analysis indicates BlackBerry is a high-margin software business that the market doesn't believe could operate a coffee cart at an airport. Their IOT businesses includes the dominant OS for automotive software and an emerging SaaS platform co-developed with AWS both of which should command high multiples. The stock trades at a massive discount to comparable AI-adjacent infrastructure software businesses. In a base case, the stock should trade at $12–$18 in the next 2–3 quarters and if IOT guidance is strong next earnings it can pop to 20+.",59,1739816301.0,BB_Stock,10,0.98,False

​In 1985, Marcy opened the first Garden Spot Nursery in Wallingford Center in Seattle. Five years later she opened a second seasonal location in Sunnyland Square where Cruising Coffee is now. After a few years, Marcy sold the Seattle Garden Spot Location and the Bellingham location moved down the street to the corner of Alabama and King Street. In January 2021, she turned the reins over to me and I have been loving working with Bellingham gardeners ever since. 

I grew up in Washington and moved to Bellingham to attend Western Washington University, where I double majored in Biology and English.

In Spring of 2012, I walked in looking for a job to help me get through college, something flexible where I could work outside and learn about plants, and quickly fell in love with the work, the people, and the science of gardening. I started as a cashier and knew very little about plants. After a few years, I became the plant receiver and worked behind the scenes processing orders. In more recent years, I have worked the sales floor, helping gardeners and playing with plants.

I am thinking about my veggie garden this year and dreaming of more tomatoes!
