I bought my partner a Flair and Eureka Mignon Notte as a gift a few years back, and want to get them a proper espresso machine.

They have been struggling to grind and pull shots consistently with the Flair, and they are becoming frustrated with using it.

Looking for a simple to use machine (probably standalone, as they have a frother, steamer, timer, scale, portafilter)

Price range is max $500, but lower the better.

We get along great and have tons of things in common from hobbies to views on life. We have hung out a few times outside of work. The first time was with another male coworker having drinks. The second time was with just her at a coffee shop. Third time was with a bunch of coworkers. This third time we hung out, she drove me which I really appreciated. When we left the event, she told me she likes another coworker and was wanting to ask him out. I figured at that moment it‚Äôs now or never. So, I told her how I felt about her. She let me down in a very sweet way and we were talking about it when she was taking me back to my car. From what she‚Äôs told me about what she looks for in a guy, he doesn‚Äôt really match what she looks for, but things can happen and change. I then kind of called her bluff and said ‚Äúyou should ask him out to dinner. I‚Äôm sure he will say yes. He‚Äôs a really cool and sweet guy.‚Äù She hesitated and said no with little explanation as to why. Well, I get home that night as she texted me to make sure I made it home safe. Going back a bit to that same night, I jokingly told her I would take her out for lunch and a day to just hangout and left it at that. She giggled and said sure. Not thinking anything more of it or not even really meaning it, I left it at that. Well, fast forward a few days later, she texted me early in the morning and asked if I still wanted to hangout. Not having anything else to do that day, I said sure. I went to go pick her up and we had a great day and talked a lot. At one point she went back to the night where we were out with our coworkers and she said she was saying weird stuff due to the drinks she had. She had one drink as did I. We then went shopping and I was helping her pick out clothes for her niece. She then asked me if I ever want kids one day. I told her yes and her face lit up, but nothing more. I have also met her family and they really seem to like me. At that time, we were at her house after work, watching tv and chilling with her dogs. That night, I was helping her bake a cake and talking with her family. It was a great night. The whole reason for this post is I am wondering if she really meant liking the other coworker or just trying to gauge my reaction? I am getting so many mixed signals and I really like her a lot.

I‚Äôve been where you are. The sweaty palms, racing heart, the constant feeling like everyone‚Äôs eyes are on you‚Äîeven if they aren‚Äôt. Anxiety in public places was ruining my life. Simple tasks like grocery shopping or meeting a friend for coffee felt like climbing Everest. I was at my breaking point, barely able to step outside my door some days.

But then, everything changed. I stumbled upon something that didn‚Äôt just manage my anxiety; it *transformed* it. I‚Äôm not talking about expensive therapy or medication that made me feel numb‚Äîthis was different.

For the first time in years, I felt calm in a crowd. I no longer had that looming sense of dread when I had to leave the house. My chest didn‚Äôt feel like it was going to cave in at the slightest social interaction.

If you‚Äôre tired of feeling trapped by your anxiety, if you‚Äôre done letting it control your life and dictate what you can or can't do, then you *need* to check this out. I wish I‚Äôd found it sooner, and I‚Äôm genuinely hoping it can help you like it helped me.

Here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîwhen I say it changed everything, I mean it. And if you‚Äôre serious about reclaiming your freedom, I can‚Äôt recommend this enough. Take the step I did, and see how much your life can improve.

üëâ [Discover the Anti-Anxiety Formula](https://www.anxietysupports.com/l/The-Anti-Anxiety-Formula) üëà

Trust me, if you‚Äôre tired of feeling anxious, this could be the turning point you‚Äôve been waiting for.

You don‚Äôt have to keep living in fear. You deserve to enjoy life outside the walls of your home. üíô

Mae adjusts her scarf dramatically as she sits across from Charles at a dimly lit coffee shop in Tallahassee. The air is thick with unspoken tension, and Mae‚Äôs latte remains untouched. Her eyes dart around nervously, then settle on Charles, who leans back in his chair with the calm detachment of a man who has seen this scene play out too many times.  

‚ÄúListen, Charles,‚Äù Mae begins, voice trembling slightly, ‚ÄúI stalked you down here because, well, I have no friends. Everyone keeps ghosting me, and I just‚Äî‚Äù she pauses for effect, lowering her voice, ‚Äú‚ÄîI need you to start validating me again. I‚Äôm willing to make some concessions.‚Äù  

Charles raises an eyebrow, intrigued but unsurprised. ‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll hear them. What can you do?‚Äù  

Mae straightens, adopting her most serious air. ‚ÄúFirst,‚Äù she says, ‚ÄúI will allow you to take the role of the smarter person in the relationship. But! I will maintain my intellectual aura so that people still see me as brilliant, which will, of course, reflect well on you. It‚Äôs a win-win.‚Äù  

Charles nods slowly, gesturing for her to continue.  

‚ÄúI will also need constant validation and praise,‚Äù Mae says quickly, ‚Äúand I must be reminded that everyone is jealous of me. Because they are, Charles. They are. And, of course, I need you to tolerate all of my friends‚Äîwhen I have them‚Äîand my ramblings. Especially when I spiral. And writhe. You have to be there for the writhing.‚Äù  

Charles sighs, leaning forward. ‚ÄúMae, I‚Äôm already aware of all of this. Let‚Äôs cut to the chase. What I *really* need to know is: are you going to clean the house? Are you going to change the sheets, do laundry, and clean the cat litter?‚Äù  

Mae hesitates, then nods solemnly. ‚ÄúYes, Charles, I will do all of these things. But you know how my dysphoria and anhedonia affect me. So, sometimes I‚Äôll be better at it than others. Sometimes I just‚Ä¶ won‚Äôt have the energy.‚Äù She looks down for a moment, then brightens. ‚ÄúOh! And you need to tell everyone that I‚Äôm a very good cook. It doesn‚Äôt really matter if this is true or not.‚Äù  

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù Charles says with a wave of his hand. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fair. Now let‚Äôs talk financials.‚Äù  

‚ÄúYes, yes,‚Äù Mae interrupts, leaning forward earnestly. ‚ÄúI will pay half the rent, and when we go out to eat, I‚Äôll pay for it. I‚Äôll also cover things around the house and volunteer to get the groceries.‚Äù  

Charles nods, satisfied. ‚ÄúPerfect. That‚Äôs non-negotiable.‚Äù  

‚ÄúBut wait!‚Äù Mae says, her voice rising slightly. ‚ÄúAre you still going to talk about Tif all the time? Because, Charles, that really *bothered* me.‚Äù  

Charles leans back in his chair, unbothered. ‚ÄúOf course I‚Äôm going to talk about Tif all the time. That‚Äôs non-negotiable. And yes, my mother Peggy will remain an ever-present figure in our lives.‚Äù  

Mae flinches but doesn‚Äôt argue. ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù she says finally, her voice resigned. ‚ÄúSeeing as I have literally no one else in my life, of course we can make it work.‚Äù

The streets of Los S√∫enos were still relatively quiet, but he knew that wouldn't last for long. As a police officer, he had seen his fair share of crime in the city, but the recent series of murders had everyone on edge. He had a feeling that today would be another long day...

As he pulled into the station, Mason was greeted by his partner, Detective Riley, who looked like he hadn't slept in days. ""Hey, Swan,"" Riley said as he sipped his own cup of coffee. ""You ready for another long day?""
""I suppose so,"" Mason replied, trying to hide his exhaustion. ""Any updates on the murders?""
Suddenly a female voice was heard over the intercom: ""Officer Swan, please come to the Chief's office""
Mason looked at Riley, who shrugged in response. ""Sounds like the Chief wants to see you,"" he said. Swan sighed and made his way to the Chief's office. He had a feeling he knew what this meeting was about.

As he entered the room, he saw the Chief sitting behind his desk, a stern expression on his face. ""Ah, Officer Swan,"" the Chief said, gesturing for him to take a seat. ""I need to talk to you about something.""
""What is it?""
The Chief leaned back in his chair and looked Swan straight in the eyes. ""We have reason to believe that these recent murders are the work of a serial killer,"" he said. Swan's heart sank. He had suspected as much, but hearing it confirmed was still jarring.
""Alright, what do you want for me to do?"" Swan said
""I'm assigning you to lead the case,"" the Chief replied. ""I need you and your team to work around the clock to find this serial killer before they strike again.""
""Great... am I free to choose personell?""
Swan said with hope
""Yes, you are,"" the Chief said. ""Pick the best team you can gather. I want this case solved as soon as possible.""
Swan replied: ""Thanks, Sir. Am I free?""
""Yes, you‚Äôre free to go,"" the Chief said. ""But keep me updated on your progress. I want regular reports on your investigation.""
""OK, thanks again""
""No problem,"" the Chief said. ""And Swan, don‚Äôt hesitate to call for backup if you need it. This killer is dangerous and we can‚Äôt take any chances.""
But Swan didn't heard him, he already got out of the Chief's office and thought from what to start, Mason's mind was racing as he walked back to his desk. He knew that finding a serial killer was no easy task, and the stakes were higher than ever before. He needed to think carefully and plan his next move. He sat down at his desk and began to review the files on the victims.
He saw that 2 people have been killed in 213 Park homes, the poorest hood in the city.Mason knew that he needed to get to the bottom of the murders and that his best bet was to speak to his old informant, Jose. He grabbed his jacket and headed out of the station, his next destination-213 Park. 

Mason arrived at Jose's small house. The windows were boarded up, and the front door was covered in graffiti. Despite the ominous surroundings, Mason  knocked on the door.
There was a muffled voice from the house
""Mason, you?""
""Yes, open up Jose""
A moment later, the door opened and Jose appeared, he was clearly annoyed. ""Mason... what do you want this time?""
""I want information, Mason answered shortly"".
""Fine, you better have cash then,"" Jose said.
""I do, get us some tea""
Jose led Mason into the cramped living room and motioned for him to sit down on the lumpy couch. ""Tea? Really?"" Jose said, but headed into the kitchen to prepare a cup of tea anyway.
Mason glanced around the room as he waited for Jose to return. The place was a mess, with empty beer bottles and dirty dishes strewn about. Despite the chaos, he knew that Jose had a reputation for being one of the best informants in the city.
Jose returned, and they they spent the next hour discussing the recent murders, with Mason asking Jose about any information or details he had heard on the street.

A hour later, they heard a knock, and a muffled voice ""open up, Amigo""!
Jose skin became pale, he said:
""S*it... Los Locos... they found out that I am informant""
Mason's heart began to beat 2 times harder, as Jose said it. Los Locos was a feared gang in the city, known for their ruthless tactics and violence. If they had found out about Jose's help to  police, it was a big trouble for both of them. ""Calm down,"" Mason said, trying to keep his voice stable ""We need to get out of here, now."" 
But the door was kicked open, and three gangsters rushed in the house.
Mason and Jose froze as the three gangsters burst into the house, brandishing knives and guns. But suddenly Jose took a shotgun, while Mason took his pistol, fired at bandits, killing one.The sound of gunfire filled the room as Jose and Mason responded to the attack. Jose fired off two shots with his shotgun, taking down another gangster while Mason used his pistol to kill the third. The room fell silent, except for the sound of their heavy breathing.
""I'ma call for a coroner""... here is your 500 dollars""
""Thanks""... 
""You can find me in my office"" Swan said
Yeah, ok.

At the office, Swan was thinking about information he got, he thought that the murders are religious, so he got his shotgun and driven to the cult, where he could get more info.

As he arrived at the camp, he was scared. The place was surrounded by tall fences and cameras, and the only entrance was guarded by two armed men.
""Hands up!"" Mason shouted
He immediately got greeted with heavy gun fire, and he even got shot in leg.
""F*CK""
Mason radioed for backup as he hid behind the bush, trying to avoid the bullets that were flying all around him: ""Bravo-3 to Adam-1, Shots fired, Send SWAT immediately!"". He could hear the cult members shouting to each other.

The SWAT team soon arrived and stormed the compound, killing the gunmen and arresting the members of the cult. The cult's leader, a man named John, was among those taken into custody. Special team searched John's House and they found knives that have blood stains on it, also he had the same fingerprints as ones found on corpses. It confirmed their suspicions that the cult leader was the prime suspect in the serial killings.

Later, Swan was invited to the local news agency, and after coming home he saw news about criminal catched, with him as the main detective. News said: ""In a significant development, the police have apprehended a suspect in connection with the recent serial killings that have shocked the city. Officer Mason Swan has been identified as the lead detective in the case, and he played a crucial role in bringing the suspect to justice."" Swan chuckled and putted the tea pot on, It was complete silence, so tired man fell asleep quickly, and the other day, he went to work as always. In office he got ready for work: Mason grabbed his coffee, still feeling the weight of exhaustion from the previous days. As he sat at his desk reviewing the case files, his Chief approached him. 

‚ÄúHi, Mason,‚Äù the Chief said, his demeanor a mix of seriousness and gratitude. ‚ÄúThe SWAT team leader wants to talk with you.‚Äù

Mason raised an eyebrow, curious. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúDavid Judge Beaumont. He‚Äôs been leading the team for a while now. Go on, he‚Äôs in the conference room,‚Äù the Chief directed.

Mason nodded and made his way to the conference room, where he found a tall, broad-shouldered man with a no-nonsense expression. Beaumont looked up as Mason entered, his blue eyes piercing.

‚ÄúOfficer Swan,‚Äù Beaumont extended a hand. ‚ÄúGood to finally meet you. First off, good work yesterday. You were the lead detective in taking down that cult.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, sir. I was just following the evidence,‚Äù Mason replied, shaking Beaumont‚Äôs hand firmly.

‚ÄúEvidence, sure, but it takes guts to act under fire. I‚Äôm here for a reason. We lost Operative Alabama during the raid, and I could use someone with your skills on D Platoon,‚Äù Beaumont said, his tone direct.

Mason felt a rush of adrenaline. ‚ÄúAre you asking me to join SWAT?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm saying. If you‚Äôre interested, it‚Äôd mean more intense missions, but you‚Äôd be part of a team that‚Äôs making significant headway against the worst elements in Los S√∫enos. What do you say?‚Äù

Mason thought for a moment. He had always wanted to be on a team like that, to have the opportunity to make a real difference. He looked at Beaumont, who seemed confident in his abilities and serious about the work.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm in. I‚Äôd like to help however I can,‚Äù Mason responded.

‚ÄúGood choice. Welcome aboard. I‚Äôll get the paperwork sorted out,‚Äù Beaumont said with a nod. ‚ÄúNow, we‚Äôve got a situation arising at the 4U gas station on Southern Vandrake. I want you to be ready. We‚Äôre putting a team together to handle it.‚Äù

There are times when the graphics look a bit ugly but there are also many parts where they look beautiful, but I still think they could have improved that.

I love it when fighting games break away from the genre and experiment with other genres, one of my favorite games is Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks

I would have loved it if the World Tour mode had moved even further away from the Street Fighter style of combat and made the gameplay more Hack And Slash and Beat Em Up style.

I would also have liked that instead of using a created Avatar we were using the original Street Fighter 6 characters like Ryu, Chun-Li or Juri in a Hack And Slash style gameplay. ",2,1732470177.0,StreetFighter,14,1.0,False

1gywmuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creativity/comments/1gywmuf/what_john_cleese_taught_me_about_creativity_as_a/,What John Cleese taught me about creativity as a route to happiness,"*John Cleese*¬†is a comedian, actor, writer and producer. His many achievements include being a founding member of the iconic comedy troupe¬†*Monty Python*¬†and co-writing and staring in¬†*Fawlty Towers*. His book,¬†*Creativity: A short and cheerful guide*, provides a glimpse into the mind of this creative genius.

Here‚Äôs one story¬†*John*¬†shares.¬†*If I wrote a sketch by myself in the evening, I'd often get stuck, and would sit there at my little desk, cudgeling my brains. Eventually I'd give up and go to bed. In the morning I‚Äôd wake up and make myself a cup of coffee. Then I'd drift over to the desk. Almost immediately, the solution to the problem I'd been wrestling with the previous evening became quite obvious to me! So obvious that I couldn't really understand why I hadn't spotted it the night before. But I hadn't.*

*John Cleese*¬†said,¬†*Learning from something or someone you admire is not stealing.*¬†So, I have permission to share a few of his ideas.

# Creativity is a skill

>Creativity is not a talent. It is a way of operating. -¬†*John Cleese*

Creativity isn‚Äôt an innate talent but a skill that can be developed with practice and the right mindset. It‚Äôs accessible to everyone, not just¬†*creative types*.

When young, I had no idea I could be creative.¬†*Maths*¬†was my thing. Now, I love building tools for colleagues, designing apps and writing. Creativity is a skill I‚Äôve learned.

# Open and closed modes

>The open mode is a relaxed, expansive and playful state of mind that is essential for creative problem solving. The closed mode is more linear, logical and focused. This is good for execution but bad for generating ideas. -¬†*John Cleese*

For creativity, it important to make time and space to enter the open mode.

Daily walks along my local canal and river provide space for me to come up with ideas.

# Embrace playfulness

>The most creative people have this childlike facility to play. -¬†*John Cleese*

Playfulness is a key ingredient in fostering creativity. Approaching problems with a sense of humour and curiosity often leads to innovative solutions.

I had an idea to repurpose the dried-out body of a frog I found in my garden. I placed the frog in a cup, peering over the edge, on a colleague‚Äôs desk. My colleague became aware of something staring at him. Naturally, he assumed it was plastic. Then he realised it wasn‚Äôt. Play was a big part of our office culture.

# Accept uncertainty

>Nothing will stop you from being creative so effectively as the fear of making a mistake. -¬†*John Cleese*

Creativity involves embracing uncertainty and resisting the urge to jump to conclusions. Staying with problems longer can lead to more original ideas. Risk and failure are part of the creative process.

I try to accept that there is little I directly control in life. I can control my attitude and the actions I take, but not whether this leads to a successful outcome. However, as the common refrain has it,¬†*The harder I work, the luckier I get.*

# Subconscious mind

>We don't know where we get our ideas from. What we do know is that we do not get them from our laptops. -¬†*John Cleese*

Often, the best ideas emerge when the conscious mind takes a break. Sleep on problems or take a step back to let the subconscious work on solutions.

When my older brother was studying for¬†*A Levels*, he played recordings of textbooks while he was asleep, on the basis it would sink in over night. He went on to get a degree, undertake a doctorate then became a professor. So, maybe, it worked.

I have been diagnosed with HH, GERD, Helicobacter pylori last year.



All of that started on my vacation, I got anxious because I was bloated most of the time, and that all put so much pressure that I started to feel a pulsation of my heart. At night, I felt my stomach ""working"" all night together with heath palpitations.



I went to the ER and immediately they told me I have a hiatal hernia.



I did a gastroscopy and took 3 antibiotics for 14 days.

I have had tinnitus for 3 years and with the worsening of GI problems, my tinnitus gets worse.



2.  Sometimes I get random dizziness when standing like my feet drop down and the floor is unsteady.



3. When I am lying down, I feel my heartbeat, and again, I feel like I am on a boat.

The world economy is booming. Crypto is hitting all time highs.

All you need is .01% of it to make $15,000 a month‚Ä¶

Here‚Äôs the blueprint on how to get your piece of the pie:

Look at where money is flowing.

* ‚Üí Real estate
* ‚Üí Stocks/crypto
* ‚Üí Consumer products

But only 3% of people actually invest...

That means if you want to get rich, you should own equity in a product business.

The best place to do this is Amazon.

You don't need to find customers...

You don't need a new product...

You don't need any followers...

There's already 200M daily shoppers buying the products you can sell.

Here's exactly how to get started:

# Choose a great market

The best markets to sell in are groups of people with a specific problem.

For example: women who love coffee, but deal with jitters from caffeine.

[ADHD Women](https://preview.redd.it/dzqmviobcp2e1.jpg?width=1006&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f8fd7c4dab7639951e18e01829610437ad35f2b)

From here, it's easy to find a popular product and tailor it for this market.

# Find a winning product

Once you find a problem to target...

Use [https://Kalodata.com](https://honeysyed.com/kalodata) (use prl for 10% discount) and jungle scout to find existing products that solve this.

You want to find a product people are already buying on TikTok & Amazon.

Here's an example

[Ashwagandha coffee](https://preview.redd.it/d2rhka7sdp2e1.jpg?width=1304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=648052c528645c59b289184ed5a0401b2931d0b6)

I found this Ashwagandha coffee on Kalodata and we can copy it.

* ‚Üí No crashes or jitters
* ‚Üí Organically roasted
* ‚Üí Mind, memory, and energy boost

These are unique benefits our customers look for and will make them buy from us over other coffee brands.

# Create your own brand

Go to pinterest and create a moodboard for your brand's vibe.

Then go to namelix to generate names/logos that fit this aesthetic.

Here's one for the coffee brand.

[Coffee Brand Moodboard](https://preview.redd.it/kbyml5ovdp2e1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fefea269185dbea1d39d525be49caf3eb7541e74)

# Create & launch your products

* Use Alibaba or Thomasnet to find the best manufacturers.
* Use [https://Helium10.com](https://honeysyed.com/helium10) to find the top keywords to target on Amazon.
* Use [sell.amazon.com](http://sell.amazon.com) to create your seller account and launch your listing.

# Here‚Äôs the math on this:

You pay $3.50/unit to the supplier.

You pay $5.10 for shipping.

You sell for $22/unit on Amazon.

After fees, that's $8.70 profit.

1,000 sales = $8,700 profit.

Cafe Mintar is the kind of place where you can grab a coffee, open your laptop, and dive into your work with focus and flair. The atmosphere strikes a perfect balance between ‚Äúrelaxed hangout‚Äù and ‚Äúproductive workspace,‚Äù making it ideal for everything from brainstorming sessions to knocking out that to-do list

The coffee is excellent‚Äîsmooth, strong, and clearly crafted with care. Whether you‚Äôre a flat white purist or someone who orders drinks with five words in the name, they‚Äôve got you covered. Bonus points for the baristas, who are warm, approachable, and somehow always seem genuinely interested in how your day is going.

The space itself is unpretentious and inviting. Think comfy chairs, eclectic art on the walls, and enough outlets to make every table feel like prime real estate. The WiFi is fast and reliable‚Äîperfect for emails, meetings, or whatever project needs your attention.

Conveniently located on Avenue du Parc, not far from Place des Arts and Parc Mont-Royal, it‚Äôs the perfect stop whether you‚Äôre gearing up for a day exploring the park or settling in for some serious productivity. The blend of central location and laid-back vibe makes it an easy choice for locals and visitors alike

Mintar‚Äôs charm is in its simplicity. It‚Äôs not trying to be the fanciest spot in Montreal, and that‚Äôs exactly what makes it work. Come for the coffee, stay for the focus-friendly atmosphere.",1,1732469453.0,codingincoffeeshops,0,1.0,False

1gywdi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Skeb/comments/1gywdi7/declined_for_offering_slightly_more_than_artists/,Declined for offering slightly more than artist's recommended amount?,"Sorry for the mouthful of a title! I'm kind of new to Reddit (lurked for many years without an account) and very new to Skeb, so I'm sorry in advance if this is a common scenario. I tried looking it up in this subreddit but I didn't see anyone discuss something like this. So I'd thought I'd at least ask to see if maybe this is an etiquette thing or if it's a one-time occurrence.

Anyways, I've been an active commissioner for more than a decade, but I just discovered skeb last month (I live under a rock, I know). I treat art commissions like I do going to coffee shops and such, which is to say I tend to add at least a little tip when I pay. It depends on how expensive it is, when I pay, if I can afford to, the rapport I have with the artist, etc. But that's how I've always done it, and for the most part, I've only ever been met with gratitude, if the tip is acknowledged at all. So anyways, since discovering skeb, I've taken this mindset with most of the requests I've sent--which is admittedly very few--adding 1k-2k more yen above the recommended price when I send requests, particularly if I really like the artist's work. For the most part, this hasn't been a problem, except for this one request.

This was an artist I've been eyeing for a little while that I decided to go ahead and commission for a two character piece; their recommended price had jumped by quite a bit since I'd last looked at them, and when I was looking at their skeb portfolio, they had a mixture of both two character pieces and solo character pieces. Since I wasn't sure how much to offer for the second character, I figured I'd tack on 2k more yen and then let the artist know they could increase the price if it wasn't enough. This artist has an average response rate of 1 day, so I figured if they didn't like the characters or if it wasn't enough money, they'd cancel it or appeal it. But my request has been pending for three days now.

In the meantime, I discovered this reddit and found people mentioning that you sometimes need to check twitter, since artists can't talk to you directly unless they use appeals. Today, I found tweets from around the time I submitted my request that I *think* are about mine, which basically say: ""Please don't offer more than the recommended price!! It stresses me out!""

I say ""think"" because the artist apologizes specifically for canceling, but my request is still pending. However, I know it's sometimes seen as rude to outright reject a request, so artists sometimes let the time expire instead. This artist only has 20 total pieces complete, though, and coupled with their one day average request response time, it seems odd to me that they've managed to maintain such a low average using the ""ignore"" method to get rid of requests they won't take--but maybe they've just never had to cancel a request before? Hard to say! 

Anyways, according to the other tweets, the artist doesn't seem to hate my request and will be fine if I just resubmit it for less money (although I'm not sure I will but that's a different discussion). The point of this long post was more about whether this is a part of skeb commissioning culture or just a particular artist's quirk. Everything I've seen here leads me to believe it's at the very least not uncommon to go a little above the recommended, especially if you're not sure about the characters, but have others experienced artists feeling pressured by tagging on extra money? I'm wondering if I should stick to the recommended amount from now on and add that ""if the pay is not enough, please feel free to increase it"" line to requests where I worry they're not high enough. I'm also happy to just tip them after the fact, since that's what the boost system is for anyway. Or maybe this is truly a one off scenario and I shouldn't let it influence me? If nothing else, I am curious what others have experienced. Thanks for reading all this if you made it this far! Have a good day!",1,1732469340.0,Skeb,4,1.0,False

""I worked on a show where the lead would deliberately eat huge amounts of raw garlic, onions, and canned tuna before kissing scenes as a messed-up power play over the actor he was partnered with for the scene.""
2. ""I lived in LA in the '90s. I worked on the fringes of the industry, but my company printed a lot of movie posters, so I saw a lot of folks when delivering proofs and such at different lots and offices. But where I ran into stuff was when I had a second part-time job at a popular clothing store, and the majority of the kids who worked there were struggling actors, writers, and creatives. There were a lot of TV shows outfitted by this clothing store, and people's party lives crossed over. The number of times I would be at house parties with a mountain of cocaine on a coffee table was mind-boggling, and it was usually 'a gif' given to one of those kids by someone in the industry (according to them).""
3. ""I was 20 or 21 and about to board a plane to film a low-budget shoot in Romania. As I was getting into the van to the airport, a producer came up to me with a blank envelope. He told me, 'Hey, I need you to give this to the producer when you get there.' I asked, 'What is it?' He said, '$25,000 in cash. Don't declare it at customs.' I was a kid, so I did it.""
4. ""The most messed-up thing is watching a 22-year-old production assistant climb into a big white box truck at the end of a 14-hour shoot at 1 a.m. and driving back from the boonies after crushing a few beers and a doing couple of bumps. I've heard of some bad accidents involving sleep-deprived grunts trying to break in.""
5. ""A very well-known pop star's uncle was offering information on said pop star for cash. Everything from baby pictures and videos to her whereabouts‚Äîyou name it, it all had a price. This happens more than you realize.""
6. ""Production assistant here. I had to sign so many NDAs about celebrities doing hard drugs between takes. The worst was watching them pressure young actresses into joining them. Some of these girls were barely 18.""
7. ""I worked on a movie set many years ago. Part of my job was to make sure the (very well-known) female star didn't steal wardrobe. Apparently, she would demand certain brands of clothing and shoes for costume fittings and then sneak them out of her trailer. About an hour after the fitting, I was getting ready to leave, and as I walked to my car, I saw her and her assistant come out of the trailer with 10 boxes of shoes. TEN! We're talking Gucci, Manolo Blahnik, Jimmy Choo, Louboutin‚Äîeasily $20,000 worth of shoes that she just decided to take home. Before I could say anything, she told me the director said it was okay. I knew that was a lie, but what could I do?""
8. ""I worked on a commercial shoot with bodybuilders. The producer asked the client on set if they wanted to oil up the bodybuilders. They gladly took up the offer and spent 30 minutes oiling up the bodybuilders, who had no choice but to take it, even though I could tell they weren't comfortable. At the time, everyone was laughing and joking around, including the bodybuilders, but looking back, it was pretty messed up to put them in that situation.""
9. ""I was a volunteer at TIFF, and an actress had overdosed in the bathroom. She was supposed to do a Q&A after the movie. Someone involved with the movie managed to get her functional enough to get through the Q&A before calling an ambulance.""
10. ""I used to seat audiences for a late show with a live audience. I would have to seat people by attractiveness: attractive people in the front, closer to the cameras, and less attractive people in the back where they can't be seen.""
11. ""I am a talent rep. It isn‚Äôt rare for us to occasionally get calls from clients on set about being asked to do things that weren‚Äôt originally included in the script but changed once the client got to set. Most of the time, it is either a stunt they are asking the client to do themselves instead of using the stunt performer or they are asking a female client to do nudity that wasn‚Äôt agreed to prior to shooting. Both are easy fixes. Normally, it is just calling the producer and telling them the client isn‚Äôt doing it, and they say okay, and the client finishes the shoot as planned. Every now and then, like under five times in 20 years, a client will call saying the production is asking them to do something wild. The most memorable time a client ever called me was when he was on set and they wanted him to manually bring an elephant to climax.""
12. [""I worked as an electrician on a reality show involving children. The kids figured out that the cameras couldn't follow them into the women's bathroom. When they got sick of the producers' bullcrap, they would occasionally go into the women's bathroom to take a break. The producers asked them to stop because they didn't want the kids discussing 'story' in there. The kids kept doing it because when you follow 10-year-olds around for 12-16 hours a day, they get sick of it (if you watch reality TV involving children, you are watching child labor law violations regularly). One of the producers brought me and another electrician into the women's bathroom while it was empty. With the way the room was set up, if you looked straight when you entered, you didn't see the stalls, or the mirrors. That wall ran the length of the stalls. He asked us to hang some lights and focus them away from the stalls.""](https://www.buzzfeed.com/kelsiehammond1/best-reality-shows)
13. ""One time I had an audition, and I had a zit on the side of my nose. The casting director just said, 'Come back when you get a bar of soap.'""
14. ""If you're on a show that travels, there are lots of instances of actors hooking up with the locals.""
15. And finally, ""I worked for an indie film company at the end of the dot-com boom. We were expanding rapidly, far beyond our means. The bosses had rented a huge multi-floor office space with tons of desks and computers, but very few employees‚Äîbecause there was very little work coming in the door. One day, some VC investors were coming to check us out. The bosses had us run around and put fake work on all the computer screens, used coffee cups, and jackets and sweaters on empty chairs.""

The first time I saw him, something felt off. Millbrook, Massachusetts had always been the kind of quiet town where everyone knew everyone, and newcomers stood out like sore thumbs. This guy? He blended in perfectly‚Äîalmost too perfectly.

I'm Michael Hartley, third-generation local and owner of the town's only hardware store. When the Victorian house at the end of Maple Street went from decades of abandonment to suddenly having a new owner, the entire town buzzed with speculation. But no one seemed as curious as me.

His name was Victor Strand. Mid-40s, impeccably dressed, always wearing dark colors that made him look like he'd stepped out of another century. He moved in during late October, when the New England autumn was painting everything in shades of rust and gold, and the nights grew long and cold.

I first met him when he came into my store, looking for some specific hardware. Black leather gloves, pale skin that seemed to have never seen sunlight, and eyes that were... unsettling. Dark. Calculating. They didn't just look at you; they seemed to look through you.

""I need some custom locks,"" he said, his voice smooth as silk but with an accent I couldn't quite place. European, maybe. ""Specific dimensions. Unusual specifications.""

As I helped him, I noticed he only came in during the late afternoon, just before sunset. And he always wore those dark glasses, even inside the store.

Little did I know then that Victor Strand would change everything about my quiet little town‚Äîand my life‚Äîforever.

The first disappearance happened three weeks after Victor Strand moved in. Mrs. Henderson's cat, a fat orange tabby named Marmalade that everyone in the neighborhood knew, vanished without a trace. Not exactly front-page news, but in Millbrook, even missing pets made waves.

Then came the rumors about blood at the local veterinary clinic. Dr. Sarah Chen, who'd been treating our pets for fifteen years, mentioned during our weekly poker game that someone had broken in and stolen their blood supplies. Twice.

""The weird thing is,"" she said, shuffling cards with practiced efficiency, ""they didn't take anything else. Not the drugs, not the equipment. Just the blood.""

I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. Maybe it was the way the streetlights near Strand's house kept burning out. Or how the newspapers he'd never collected were piling up on his porch during the day, only to vanish completely by nightfall‚Äîthough I'd never seen him pick them up.

One evening, I was closing up the store when I saw him walking with Jenny Miller, the young woman who worked at our local coffee shop. She looked... different. Dazed, almost. Like she was sleepwalking. The next day, she didn't show up for work.

When I drove past her apartment that night, I saw her through her window. She was pale, wearing a high-necked sweater despite the warm indoor heating. Her normally bright eyes looked hollow, and she kept touching her neck, like something was bothering her.

I started keeping a journal of everything I noticed about Victor Strand. The way he never cast a reflection in the store's security mirrors. How he seemed to move without making a sound. The fact that despite claiming to be renovating that old Victorian, no one ever heard construction noise during the day.

But the moment I knew‚Äîreally knew‚Äîsomething was terribly wrong was when I stayed late at the store one night to do inventory. Through the window, I saw him walking down Main Street with impossible grace. A stray cat crossed his path, and I swear to God, that animal took one look at him and ran like hell itself was chasing it.

Then he stopped, turned, and looked directly at me through the store window. His eyes glowed red in the darkness, like hot coals in a dead fire. And he smiled.

That's when I realized: Victor Strand wasn't just new in town.

He wasn't even human.

I'm not crazy. That's what I kept telling myself as I sat in my living room at 3 AM, surrounded by printouts from various websites about vampire lore. The blue light from my laptop cast strange shadows on the wall as I cross-referenced everything I'd observed about Victor Strand.

No reflections? Check. Aversion to sunlight? Check. Mysterious disappearances? Check. Strange power over others? After what I'd seen with Jenny Miller, definitely check.

But knowing something and proving it are two different things. And in a town like Millbrook, you can't just go around accusing newcomers of being vampires without concrete evidence. Not unless you want to end up being the local crackpot.

I decided to start gathering proof. First, I installed new security cameras at the store, making sure they had night vision capabilities. Then I bought a high-end digital camera with a telephoto lens. My neighbors probably thought I was developing a sudden interest in bird watching.

The first few nights of surveillance yielded nothing unusual. But on the fourth night, something happened that made my blood run cold.

Around midnight, I was parked across from Strand's house in my pickup, camera ready. A taxi pulled up, and out stepped Lisa Conway, the real estate agent who'd handled the sale of the Victorian. She walked up to Strand's door, her movements stiff and mechanical, just like Jenny's had been.

I raised my camera and started shooting. Through the lens, I watched as Strand opened the door. The porch light illuminated them both clearly. When Lisa stepped inside, I managed to capture the exact moment Strand turned to close the door. In my viewfinder, his eyes glowed like laser points, and his mouth was open in a smile that revealed teeth no human should have.

But the real shock came when I reviewed the photos at home. In every single shot, Strand was nothing but a blur. Even when Lisa was crystal clear, he appeared as a dark, distorted smudge. Except for those eyes. Those burning, red eyes.

The next morning, Lisa Conway didn't show up to work. Her assistant said she'd called in sick ‚Äì something about feeling weak and needing a few days off. I drove by her house that afternoon. All the curtains were drawn, and her car sat in the driveway, collecting fallen leaves.

I knew I had to do something. But what do you do when there's a vampire in your town? Call the police? The FBI? The local vampire hunters' union? If only it were that simple.

That night, I made two decisions. First, I would need weapons ‚Äì lots of them. Second, I needed allies. Because if what I suspected was true, Victor Strand wasn't just feeding on our town.

He was building an army.

My first stop was Father McKenna at St. Augustine's Church. If anyone would believe my vampire story, it would be a priest, right? Wrong. The moment I mentioned Strand's name, something changed in the old priest's face. Fear flickered in his eyes, and his hands started trembling.

""I'm sorry, Michael,"" he said, his Irish accent thicker than usual. ""I can't help you. Won't help you. Some battles aren't meant to be fought.""

That's when I noticed the bandage on his neck, partially hidden by his collar.

I left the church feeling sick. Even the clergy weren't safe. But I wasn't completely alone. Dr. Sarah Chen believed me ‚Äì probably because she'd been tracking the strange blood thefts and had her own suspicions.

""I've been testing samples,"" she told me in her office after hours, voice barely above a whisper. ""Blood from pets that survived encounters with... something. The cellular damage is unlike anything I've ever seen. It's like their blood was partially crystallized and then thawed.""

Sarah had converted her clinic's basement into a research lab. Microscopes, centrifuges, and medical equipment I couldn't name filled the space. On one wall hung what looked like medieval weapons ‚Äì wooden stakes, crosses, and bottles of what she claimed was blessed water from various religions.

""I've been preparing,"" she said, handling a stake with surprising familiarity. ""My grandmother in Taiwan used to tell me stories about jiangshi ‚Äì Chinese vampires. I always thought they were just stories to scare children. Now I'm not so sure.""

As we talked, the lights flickered. Sarah froze mid-sentence. Upstairs, something crashed.

""He knows,"" she whispered.

The basement door burst open. Victor Strand descended the stairs with inhuman grace, his face a mask of amusement. Jenny Miller and Lisa Conway flanked him, their eyes glazed and vacant.

""How fascinating,"" he purred, his accent more pronounced than ever. ""A hardware store owner and a veterinarian playing Van Helsing. I must admit, I'm rather impressed by your... initiative.""

Sarah lunged for the weapons, but Jenny moved with supernatural speed, pinning her against the wall. I reached for a cross, but Lisa's hand clamped around my wrist like an iron vise.

Strand walked between us, examining Sarah's research with casual interest. ""Quite thorough,"" he mused. ""You know, I usually just kill meddlesome locals, but you two... you show promise. Particularly you, Doctor. Your scientific curiosity, your preparation... you'd make an excellent addition to my family.""

He smiled, revealing those terrible fangs. ""So, what do you say? Care to advance your research from the inside?""

I struggled against Lisa's grip, watching helplessly as Strand moved toward Sarah, his eyes burning red in the fluorescent light of the basement lab. But Sarah wasn't looking at him.

She was looking at me, and her hand was slowly moving toward something on the shelf behind her.

We weren't done fighting. Not yet.

Time seemed to slow as Sarah's fingers inched toward the shelf. Strand was so focused on his grand villainous monologue that he didn't notice. Classic vampire ego ‚Äì they love to hear themselves talk.

""Your research could help us solve the daylight problem,"" Strand continued, pacing between us. ""Imagine it ‚Äì vampires walking freely in the sun. No more hiding. No more skulking in shadows.""

Sarah's hand closed around something. A spray bottle? She caught my eye and mouthed what looked like ""close them.""

I squeezed my eyes shut just as Sarah screamed, ""Get some sun, you parasitic bastard!""

A hissing sound filled the air, followed by unholy shrieks. I opened my eyes to see Strand and his minions recoiling, their skin smoking. Jenny's grip on Sarah loosened, and Lisa stumbled back from me, releasing my wrist.

""UV solution,"" Sarah gasped, shoving the bottle into my hands. ""Run!""

We bolted up the stairs, but I could already hear them recovering behind us. Sarah grabbed her car keys from her desk.

""The solution won't hold them long,"" she said as we raced to her car. ""It's diluted ‚Äì I wasn't sure of the concentration needed.""

We peeled out of the parking lot just as Strand emerged from the clinic, his face partially healed but still raw and blistered. In the rearview mirror, I saw him watching us leave, not pursuing. He didn't need to. In a town this small, there was nowhere to really run.

Sarah drove us to my house ‚Äì apparently vampires need an invitation to enter, and I'd never invited Strand in. As we barricaded ourselves inside, she explained more.

""I've been studying them for weeks,"" she said, pulling up files on her laptop. ""They're not just feeding here. Millbrook is an experiment. Strand's creating different types of vampires using varying amounts of his blood. Some can walk in dim sunlight, others are stronger at night. He's trying to breed a superior vampire race.""

""How do you know all this?""

Sarah's face darkened. ""Because he offered to turn me two weeks ago. Said he needed someone with medical knowledge. I pretended to consider it to buy time for my research.""

A rock crashed through my window, making us both jump. Outside, Lisa Conway stood on my lawn, her once-friendly face twisted into a snarl.

""Last chance,"" she called out, but it was Strand's voice coming from her mouth. ""Join us willingly, and I'll let you keep your minds. Refuse, and, well..."" She gestured at herself, demonstrating what would become of us.

I looked at Sarah. ""We need help.""

""I know someone,"" she said quietly. ""But you're not going to like it. Remember Charlie Young?""

My stomach dropped. Charlie Young was Millbrook's disgrace ‚Äì a washed-up horror movie effects artist who had a mental breakdown and started claiming monsters were real. Everyone avoided him now.

Turns out he wasn't so crazy after all.

""Make the call,"" I said, as more rocks began hitting my house.

We had until sunrise to figure out a plan. After that, Strand would make the choice for us.

Charlie Young lived in a converted school bus at the edge of town. The outside was painted with grotesque monsters that I'd always assumed were from his movie days. Now I wondered if they were portraits from life.

Sarah drove us there in her car, taking back roads to avoid Strand's patrols. The sun was rising, which meant we were temporarily safe ‚Äì though I kept thinking about Strand's experiments with daywalkers.

The bus door opened before we could knock. Charlie stood there in a ratty bathrobe, wild grey hair sticking out in all directions. His eyes were sharp though, clearer than I remembered.

""Finally,"" he said, stepping aside to let us in. ""Been wondering when someone would figure it out.""

The inside of the bus was a vampire hunter's dream ‚Äì or a madman's lair, depending on your perspective. Walls covered in newspaper clippings, surveillance photos, maps with red strings connecting different locations. Weapons everywhere: stakes, crossbows, bottles of holy water, UV lights.

""You knew about Strand?"" I asked.

Charlie laughed bitterly. ""Known about him for decades. He's old. Real old. The Victorian house? He owned it in the 1920s too, under a different name. Did the same thing ‚Äì moved in, started turning people slowly, building a nest.""

""What happened then?"" Sarah asked.

""Town burned the house down with him inside."" Charlie pulled out an old newspaper clipping. ""Course, fire doesn't kill the old ones. Just inconveniences them. He went underground, probably slept for a few decades. Now he's back, with new scientific ideas.""

""How do you know all this?""

Charlie pushed up his sleeve, revealing a mess of scar tissue on his forearm. ""Because I was there in the '20s. My grandfather was part of the group that burned the house. Strand got to him first, turned him. Made me watch as my own grandfather tried to rip my throat out. I was just a kid.""

Sarah and I exchanged looks. Charlie would have to be over a hundred years old if that were true.

""Vampire blood,"" he said, noting our confusion. ""Even if you fight off the turn, it changes you. Ages you slower. Gives you a real personal interest in killing these bastards.""

He walked to a cabinet and pulled out what looked like a modified cattle prod. ""Been waiting for someone else to notice what's happening. Can't fight him alone ‚Äì learned that the hard way last time he surfaced, in '73. Lost my wife then.""

A bang on the bus door made us all jump. Through the tinted windows, I could see Jenny Miller standing in the weak morning sun, wearing a hooded cloak.

""They followed us,"" Sarah whispered.

""No,"" Charlie said, checking his weapons. ""They've been watching me. Waiting. Strand knows I'm the only one in town who can really hurt him."" He tossed me the cattle prod. ""Blessed silver in the tip. Won't kill them, but it'll hurt like hell.""

Jenny's voice came through the door, but like Lisa before, it was Strand speaking: ""Charlie, Charlie, Charlie. Still hiding in your little bus? I owe you for '73, old friend. Why don't you introduce me to your new pets?""

Charlie pumped a shotgun that presumably wasn't loaded with normal shells. ""Three rules,"" he said. ""Don't let them touch you ‚Äì skin contact lets them into your mind. Don't look directly in their eyes. And whatever happens, don't stop moving. Ready?""

Sarah grabbed a crossbow from his wall. I gripped the cattle prod.

""One more thing,"" Charlie added, his face grim. ""If I turn... don't hesitate. Kill me.""

Then he opened the door.

The morning sun cast long shadows across Charlie's property as Jenny stumbled back from the door. She wasn't alone. Lisa Conway emerged from behind the bus, and behind her came three people I recognized from town: the mailman, a high school teacher, and the kid who worked at the gas station. All wearing hooded cloaks, all moving with that same unnatural grace.

Charlie's shotgun roared, spraying Lisa with what looked like holy water mixed with silver shavings. She screamed, her skin blistering, but kept coming.

Sarah fired her crossbow, pinning the mailman's cloak to a tree. When he yanked free, smoke rose where sunlight hit his exposed skin. These weren't full vampires yet ‚Äì Strand was still experimenting on them.

""The sun hurts them!"" I shouted, jabbing the cattle prod at Jenny as she lunged for me. The blessed silver connected with her arm, and the smell of burning flesh filled the air.

""They're just the welcome party,"" Charlie yelled back, reloading his shotgun. ""Where's Strand?""

As if summoned by his name, Victor Strand's voice echoed around us, seeming to come from everywhere and nowhere: ""Still the same brutal Charlie, I see. How many innocent people will you hurt trying to get to me?""

""They stopped being innocent when you turned them,"" Charlie snarled, firing another blast at the gas station kid who was climbing up the bus.

Sarah had backed herself against the bus, crossbow swinging between targets. ""They're herding us,"" she said. ""Pushing us toward the trees where it's darker.""

She was right. Each attack forced us to step back, away from the relative safety of the morning sun. Charlie seemed to realize it too.

""Inside!"" he commanded. ""Now!""

We retreated into the bus, slamming the door shut. Through the windows, we could see our attackers circling, their movements becoming more confident as clouds began rolling in.

""Convenient weather,"" Charlie muttered, pulling up some floorboards to reveal more weapons. ""He's gotten stronger. Couldn't control the weather in '73.""

He handed us each what looked like paintball guns. ""UV pellets,"" he explained. ""Homemade. Concentrated ultraviolet burst on impact. Won't kill them but‚Äî""

The bus rocked violently. Through the ceiling vent, I caught a glimpse of red eyes.

""They're on the roof,"" Sarah said, aiming her UV gun upward.

Metal groaned as vampire hands began peeling back the bus's roof like a sardine can. Charlie cursed, grabbing something that looked like a flare gun.

""Cover your eyes!"" he yelled, firing straight up.

An explosion of white light flooded the bus. Inhuman shrieks filled the air, followed by thuds as bodies fell from the roof.

When I could see again, Charlie was clutching his chest, breathing hard.

""Charlie?"" Sarah moved toward him.

""Stay back!"" he warned, pulling down his collar to reveal a bite mark. ""One of them got me when the roof went. I can... I can feel it starting.""

His eyes were already changing, the pupils expanding unnaturally.

""The cabinet behind you,"" he gasped. ""Red box. There's information... about Strand's first death. The house... the fire wasn't random. They knew... something...""

He convulsed, fangs beginning to extend.

""Go!"" he roared, his voice no longer human. ""I'll hold them off. Tenth floorboard from the door... everything you need...""

Sarah grabbed my arm, pulling me toward the emergency exit at the back of the bus. The last thing I saw was Charlie Young, vampire hunter, centenarian, and Millbrook's crazy old man, charging out the front door into a crowd of vampires, flare gun blazing.

Behind us, storm clouds blotted out the sun completely.

We ran.

We didn't stop running until we reached the abandoned paper mill on the outskirts of town. Sarah had packed Charlie's red box and whatever she could grab from under the tenth floorboard ‚Äì a leather-bound journal and a stack of yellowed photographs.

Lightning flashed outside as we barricaded ourselves in the mill's old office. The storm was directly overhead now, turning morning into night. Strand's doing.

""He's getting stronger by the hour,"" Sarah said, catching her breath. ""The weather control, the number of thralls he can manage at once...""

I opened Charlie's red box with trembling hands. Inside was a map of the original Victorian house from 1920, newspaper clippings, and a letter dated 1921. The paper was brittle, the ink faded, but still readable.

""Dear Charles,"" I read aloud. ""If you're reading this, I failed to stop him. The fire won't be enough. Strand isn't just any vampire ‚Äì he's one of the Originals. The house must burn, but more importantly, you must find the artifact. Without it, he can always return...""

The letter was signed ""Eleanor Young"" ‚Äì Charlie's grandmother.

Sarah was flipping through the journal. ""Look at this,"" she said, pointing to a sketch. It showed a medallion with intricate symbols. ""According to these notes, it's called the Ember of Night. It's what made Strand an Original. As long as he has it, he can't truly die.""

""That's why the fire didn't kill him,"" I realized. ""But where is it?""

Thunder shook the building. In the brief illumination from another lightning strike, I saw shapes moving outside the windows.

Sarah turned more pages. ""Charlie tracked the medallion. It's... oh God.""

""What?""

""It's in the house. When they burned it in 1920, the medallion fell into the old well in the basement. The well was filled in when they rebuilt. That's why Strand came back here. He's not just building an army ‚Äì he's been trying to excavate his own basement without anyone noticing.""

A slow clap echoed through the mill. We spun around to see Victor Strand standing in the doorway, impeccably dressed despite the chaos. Behind him stood Charlie, eyes now blood-red, face twisted in a mockery of his former self.

""Bravo,"" Strand said. ""You've done in one day what took Charlie decades to piece together. I must say, I'm impressed."" He stepped into the room, Charlie following like a puppet. ""Though I am sorry about the bus. I was hoping to take him intact, but he forced my hand. Just like his grandmother did.""

Sarah raised her UV gun, but Strand moved faster than thought. Suddenly he was behind her, one hand around her throat.

""Now then,"" he said conversationally, ""since you know my secret, let me share my plan. Yes, I'm excavating the well. Yes, I need the Ember. But not to maintain my immortality ‚Äì I have that already. No, I need it for something far more ambitious.""

His grip tightened on Sarah's throat. ""You see, with modern technology and the right application of the Ember's power, I can turn an entire town at once. No more slow conversion, no more hiding. Just a single moment of transformation. Beautiful, isn't it?""

I aimed my UV gun at his face. ""Let her go.""

Strand smiled. ""Michael, Michael. Always the protector. Tell me ‚Äì how many security cameras caught me without a reflection? How many photos showed me as a blur? Did you ever wonder why you could see me perfectly well in person?""

My blood ran cold as understanding dawned.

""You're already one of us,"" he said softly. ""Have been since that night in your store. You just haven't realized it yet.""

Sarah's eyes went wide as she looked at me ‚Äì really looked at me ‚Äì for the first time since that night.

I couldn't see my reflection in her glasses.

The realization hit me like a physical blow. All those nights watching Strand, documenting his movements ‚Äì he'd been watching me right back, waiting for his blood to work its way through my system. The headaches I'd been ignoring, the sensitivity to sunlight I'd blamed on stress, the way food had started to taste like ash...

""Don't fight it,"" Strand said, still holding Sarah. ""Embrace what you're becoming. The hunger you feel? That's power waiting to be claimed.""

He was right about the hunger. Now that I was aware of it, it was overwhelming. I could hear Sarah's heartbeat, smell her blood. My gums ached as fangs began to emerge.

""Michael,"" Sarah gasped. ""The journal. Page... forty-seven.""

Strand's grip tightened. ""Quiet.""

But I remembered what I'd seen in Charlie's notes. Page forty-seven had contained a single sentence, written in Eleanor Young's handwriting: ""The blood remembers what the mind forgets.""

Something clicked in my brain. Memories that weren't mine flooded in ‚Äì memories of blood, of fire, of a woman in 1920s dress holding up a medallion. Eleanor Young. I could see through Strand's eyes as she threw the Ember down the well, cursing it as the house burned around them.

""The blood,"" I whispered. ""You didn't just turn me. You made me your successor.""

Strand's smile widened. ""Very good. You're stronger than the others because you have more of my blood. I need someone to help me control them all when the great turning comes. Someone with intelligence, with drive. The others are mere drones, but you... you're like a son to me.""

Outside, more vampires were gathering. Jenny, Lisa, Charlie, and dozens of others ‚Äì half the town must have been turned by now. Their red eyes gleamed in the darkness.

""It's fitting that you should help me retrieve the Ember,"" Strand continued. ""Tonight, at midnight, my excavation finally reaches the well chamber. Together, we'll raise an army unlike anything this world has seen.""

The hunger was getting stronger. Part of me wanted to give in, to accept his offer. To be powerful. Special. Immortal.

Sarah must have seen my hesitation. ""Michael,"" she said softly. ""Remember the hardware store. Remember who you are.""

The hardware store. My father's before me, his father's before him. Three generations of serving this town, of helping neighbors, of being part of this community. The community Strand was destroying.

And suddenly I knew what Eleanor Young had discovered, what the journal meant. Strand's blood didn't just pass on vampirism ‚Äì it passed on memories, knowledge... and weaknesses.

I now knew exactly how to destroy him.

""You're right,"" I told Strand, letting my humanity slip away, embracing the monster he'd made me. ""We should do this together. Father.""

Sarah's face fell, but I silently prayed she'd trust me. Just a little longer.

Strand released her, opening his arms to embrace his prot√©g√©. His greatest creation. His biggest mistake.

Because now I knew his true weakness. And at midnight, beneath the Victorian house, one of us would die for the last time.

Midnight approached like an executioner. The storm Strand had summoned still raged, but now I could feel it too ‚Äì the electric connection between vampire and sky, between unnatural darkness and unnatural creatures. Power thrummed through my changing body as we descended into the excavated basement of the Victorian house.

Sarah came with us, surrounded by thralls. Strand thought he was keeping her as a hostage. He didn't realize she was part of my plan.

The excavation had revealed the original foundation, and there, in the center of the floor, was the well. Modern digging equipment had cleared away decades of dirt and stone. The ancient shaft disappeared into darkness below.

""Can you feel it?"" Strand asked, his eyes gleaming. ""The Ember calls to our blood.""

I could feel it ‚Äì a pulse of dark energy from deep below. The thralls arranged themselves around the well's circumference: Jenny, Lisa, Charlie, and the others, all moving in perfect synchronization. A circle of red eyes in the darkness.

""Now,"" Strand commanded, ""we begin.""

He pulled out an ancient scroll, the parchment crackling as he unrolled it. The words were in Latin, but thanks to his blood memories, I could understand them: an incantation to raise the Ember, to magnify its power a thousandfold.

As he began to chant, Sarah caught my eye. Her hand moved slightly, revealing the UV pellet gun hidden in her jacket. She'd reloaded it with something else from Charlie's supplies ‚Äì something I'd requested when we'd walked to the Victorian, whispered instructions passed during moments when Strand was distracted.

The well began to glow with a deep red light. Water started rising from its depths, but it wasn't water ‚Äì it was too thick, too dark. Blood. Decades of it, preserved by dark magic.

""Michael,"" Strand said, pausing his chant. ""Join me. Complete the circle.""

I moved to stand beside him at the well's edge. In the rising blood, I could see something glinting. The Ember of Night, pulsing like a malevolent heart.

""Together,"" Strand said, gripping my shoulder with one hand and reaching toward the Ember with the other.

I grabbed his wrist. ""Yes. Together.""

Then I pulled him close and whispered the same words Eleanor Young had spoken in 1920: ""The blood remembers.""

Strand's eyes widened as he realized his mistake. By giving me his blood, he'd given me access to all his memories ‚Äì including the true incantation Eleanor had used. Not to raise the Ember, but to bind it to its owner's life force.

""Now, Sarah!"" I shouted.

She fired her gun, but not at Strand. The pellet hit the rising blood, releasing its payload: my blood, drawn just hours ago, when I was halfway between human and vampire. The transitional blood hit the well's dark magic and reacted just as Eleanor's journals had predicted.

The effect was instantaneous. The blood in the well turned black and began to crystallize, trapping the Ember in a cage of frozen vampire blood. Strand screamed as the magic that had sustained him for centuries began to fail.

""If the Ember dies,"" he gasped, ""you'll die too. You're of my blood now!""

""Some things are worth dying for.""

The thralls were collapsing as their master's power faded. Sarah was already moving, grabbing Charlie's unresponsive body, helping others toward the stairs. She looked back at me one last time, and I nodded. She knew what to do next.

Strand's grip on my shoulder turned crushing. ""Then let's die together, 'son.'""

The crystallized blood exploded upward, encasing us both. I felt the vampire taint burning away, taking my life with it. But I saw something else too, in those final moments ‚Äì sunrise breaking through the storm clouds above. Light returning to Millbrook.

Strand's last scream was cut short as we both shattered like glass, the Ember's dark light finally fading after centuries of cursed existence.

They found us three days later, after Sarah led the authorities to the house. The official report called it a gas explosion. The survivors ‚Äì those Strand had turned ‚Äì remembered nothing of their time as thralls. Just a long, dark dream they couldn't quite recall.

The Victorian house was torn down, the well filled with concrete. Sarah made sure it was done right this time. She also took custody of Charlie's research, just in case.

You see, I didn't actually die that night. Not completely. Eleanor Young's journal had one final secret: a transitional vampire could survive the Ember's destruction if their human side was stronger than their vampire side. It took months to fully recover, and I'm not entirely human anymore ‚Äì can't handle strong sunlight, need regular transfusions, see things most people can't.

But I'm alive. Still running the hardware store, still helping my neighbors with loose hinges and stuck doors. Still watching the shadows, just in case.

Because that's the thing about small towns ‚Äì darkness may come, but light always returns.

I've found a used Silvia online for 200 euro, in a remote area that is approx 3 years old. It's about a 6 hour drive one way which I'm not willing to do just to look at it - but I can get it delivered and they have sent a video of it in action (no red flags seems to work üòÖ) but is it a big risk without being able to inspect first or are they as reliable as they seem.

I would eventually add a PID but am a bit worried about the learning curve etc coming from a relatively automated machine. I mainly do milk based drinks, 2 per day.

Just looking for some advice on whether its too much of a risk if the maintenance wasn't right etc?

Hi guys ,

My journey was full of ups and down , a lot of injuries and depression .

I was always thin and small , always anxious about my body.

Here‚Äôs my journey :

Up until 2014, I was a hyperactive kid, picky about food, and had a low-protein diet. I had skinny legs(North African genes), and did karate and played basketball. I always wanted to get bigger and stronger and have had abs for as long as I can remember.

I started calisthenics in 2015.

2015-2018:I focused on bodyweight calisthenics, training 6 days a week. My routine included upper body, lower body, and skills (handstands, human flags, muscle-ups, front lever, back lever). 

Upper Body: 5 sets of (10 dips, 5 pull-ups, and 10 push-ups) plus 10 sets of skill practice. Over time, I increased the reps and sets to up to 12 sets per workout.  
Lower Body: 5 sets of (10 jumping squats, 20 regular squats, 20 lunges, and 20 calf raises) plus 10 sets of skill practice. I gradually increased reps and sets to up to 12 sets per workout.

2018-2024: I realized I needed to build more mass since I was getting leaner, so I joined the gym.

2018-2024 Routine: Push / Pull / Legs / Rest / Push / Pull / Legs

Diet:
I stick to the same routine every day. 

Breakfast 1:
- 5 scrambled eggs

****
This is my personal journey, and there's still so much to learn. It took me 9 years to really understand my body, and I believe many people‚Äôs learning curve is shorter than mine. But the key is to enjoy the process and embrace the lessons, even from mistakes.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask!

1gywaxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/blueprint_/comments/1gywaxe/n_of_1_unbundling_longevity_mix_essential/,"N of 1: Unbundling Longevity Mix, Essential Capsules and Softgels","I've written a few times about starting to unbundle and move on from certain parts of Blueprint (post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/blueprint_/comments/1gtpeyt/thinking_of_dropping_longevity_mix_and_essential/) about Longevity Mix and Essential Capsules, and my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/blueprint_/comments/1gybal1/comment/lynrhn8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) about the Essential Softgels). People have asked me to write out the full details, which are below.

First, let me say that I love Blueprint and what Bryan is doing. He's testing on himself, and publishing the info, and helping thousands of people in the process. I've also happily spent thousands of dollars on his supplements over the months. I proudly own and tote around a Blueprint shaker! Even after moving away from these all-in-one supplements, I still intend on buying the Snake Oil olive oil (drizzled on lunch and dinner) and the Cocoa Powder (scoop in morning coffee with collagen), and will await new products and emails from him eagerly.   
  
Secondly, I eat really healthily and so while I might get certain nutrients from my diet, it doesn't mean you will. Just like how these supplements helped get me here, they might be most useful for people just starting out in their health journey. For quick reference, my diet typically is: 1/ Breakfast: greek yogurt, nuts and berries, protein shake. 2/ Lunch: green leafy salad with cruciferous veg, avocado, lean meat or fish, sauerkraut, olive oil and apple cider vinegar. 3/ Dinner: lean meat and roasted or steamed veg with olive oil. I rarely eat out, snack or drink alcohol, and so would be 90%+ adherence to this.   
  
Thirdly, I think Bryan has a really poor set of doctors around him. Don't forget, someone told him to (or at least oversaw him) consume [red wine with breakfast](https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-exec-bryan-johnson-used-to-drink-alcohol-for-breakfast-2023-8) daily...for longevity. I disagree with his stances on: daily antioxidants (they blunt gains from exercise, so I only take them on off days, Vitamin E builds up over time and can shorten lifespan), daily Metformin (blunts exercise gains, I take it when on vacation/off weeks only), Rapamycin (maybe it increases heart rate and blood glucose, but so do exercise...which no one suggests stopping) and others. 

With that, details below. Hope it helps some of you make your own informed decisions.

\--

**Longevity Mix**   
*(Blueprint link* [*here*](https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/products/longevity-blend-multinutrient-drink-mix-blood-orange-flavor)) 

Contains:  
Vitamin C  
Magnesium  
Creatine  
Glucosamine Sulfate  
Taurine  
Glycine  
L-Lysine  
Ashwagandha  
Glutathione  
L-Theanine  
Sodium Hyaluronic Acid 

What I'm replacing these with:

* [Shield by Renue](https://renuebyscience.com/products/nad-defender-liposomal-anti-inflammatory-formula) contains Vitamin C, CaAKG, Sodium Hyaluronic Acid in a superior liposomal format. More Vitamin C, a bit less Hyaluronic Acid, a lot less CaAKG (but its lipo) and it has some PEA too (not important to me): Cost $0.52 per day
* For the Amino Acids/Peptides: Creatine ($0.16 to replace the 2.5g), Taurine ($0.03), Glycine ($0.03) I take these in higher doses already via either powders (Bulk Supplements, these are the prices I quoted) or increasingly via 1g capsules (Nutricost, who have a 40% black friday sale on right now). I take enough protein from foods and shakes that I don't need to supplement with Lysine separately. 
* Magnesium: Nature's Bounty Magnesium Glycinate which are $0.07 per 120mg from Costco 
* Glucosamine Sulfate: [Costco's](https://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-glucosamine-&-chondroitin,-280-tablets.product.4000043309.html) Glucosamine and Chondroitin $0.08
* Ashwagandha and Theanine: I try to avoid herbal supplements due to contaminants, heavy metals, uncertain dosing, side effects and so on. I especially do not want Ashwagandha in the morning, due to its lowering effects on cortisol, which you want high in the morning. I also drink Green Tea most days. I don't supplement with these two.  
* Glutathione is poorly absorbed orally, and so I focus on the NAC precursor only.  

**Total Cost: $0.97 vs $1.55 per day**  
*You could probably find ways to add back in all the things I've skipped for the saved $0.70.*

**Essential Capsules**   
*(Blueprint link* [*here*](https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/products/essentials-capsules))

Contains:  
Vitamin D  
Vitamin E  
Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)  
Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)  
Vitamin B3 (Niacin)  
Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid)  
Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)  
Vitamin B7 (Biotin)  
Vitamin B9 (Folate)  
Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)  
Calcium  
Iodine  
Zinc  
Selenium  
Manganese  
Nicotinamide riboside¬†  
Broccoli Seed Extract  
Fisetin  
Luteolin  
CoQ10  
Probiotics  
Spermidine  
Boron  
Lithium

What I'm replacing these with:

* Vitamin D: [Costco](https://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-extra-strength-d3-50-mcg.%2C-600-softgels.product.11467951.html) 2,000 IU. $0.02 per day for the same dose (I take more)
* Vitamin E: I do not think people should supplement with a fat soluble antioxidant like Vitamin E, the data shows excess amounts can shorten lifespan. I use [Cronomoter](https://cronometer.com/#diary) occasionally to track my foods, and I get enough from diet (Vit E is high in olive oil, leafy veg, nuts, eggs etc).
* Vitamin B Complex: I will take half a dose (1 capsule per day) of Life Extensions [B Complex](https://www.lifeextension.com/vitamins-supplements/item01945/bioactive-complete-b-complex?srsltid=AfmBOooPkSuakvDpHAvV334nCJpIRQwoPg1fA6stsg7NS9UuckuQfw88). On Amazon that's $0.07 per day.
* Calcium: [Medical advice](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/calcium-supplements-should-you-take-them) is that people should not supplement with extra Calcium, due to calcium buildup in the arteries. I get enough Calcium from (grass fed) dairy.
* Iodine: I get enough in my diet (seafood and dairy)
* Zinc: I take quite a lot, and am tested regularly to ensure I'm in range. [Nutricost](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07735XF2K/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=A2YD2H3KGK1F4L&psc=1) (0.5 capsules per day). About $0.02 to cover the dose in the capsules.
* Selenium/Manganese: Careful you aren't getting too much already... 6oz of chicken and 1 egg is already the day's RDA for Selenium, and 2oz of nuts can contain the day's RDA of Manganese. When I've tested my blood for metals, I was high in both of these, so I'm happy to remove excess supplements from my diet. 
* Nicotinamide Riboside: I've tested my blood NAD levels twice, and in normal ranges I don't seem to need supplementation. Recent research by David Sinclair ([sigh](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.21.599604v1)) implies massive doses (3g of NMN) may be needed to see effects - and that's from one of the main NAD proponents. To cover my bases I take 50mg of Niacin (Cost $0.06), which gram for gram [raises blood NAD levels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_CY7LrFPwU) more effectively than either NR or NMN.
* Broccoli Seed Extract: This one really frustrated me...the Blueprint supplement contains Glucoraphanin but without the Myrosinase enzyme its only on average [5% bioavailable](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2021.648788/full). So I upgraded to one of the best supplements in this category, by Avmacol. Cost: $0.68, but only on off days...because, wait for the kicker, Sulforaphane itself is [anti-androgenic](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27499349/)! Again, <3 Bryan, but he needs to fire his doctors and advisors...as thousands of people are trying to achieve gains, and yet blindly blunting their success daily.
* Fisetin: Another doozy. I don't think people under 60 should accidentally take senolytics, especially not daily. Cell senescence is an important part of tissue regeneration, and it's only when senescence runs out of control when you get older that managing this via **occasional** use of senolytics makes sense. 
* Luteolin: Luteolin and Rutin supplement by [Horbaach](https://www.amazon.com/Horbaach-Luteolin-Complex-Rutin-Capsules/dp/B07HZ5RHP4/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2UBDWCQVG91T7&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.euSaj0kdYppq-PsO2LEf8cvyqpNUnoiPjydNG7xHo7QteTw5g0hHogKI9JpAHz5XJOig_b4CucOhiZjn2lPfoO7_obWF3tZYfLhtUlGYS3cLLosyKIXMd-F70O9_3cKnrsdteql2K0S7FZ7L9UDPRRh8cn8IZCK-gwRii89Eh3QqCaTzmy73lXJrL_U1tkbnzqlXE9osmzMwTv4bgkN5jqP66KeEo0Wkrv8BwTDsP794up5OgqPvl3hNmA7JKW4ciIAT587FW54sFH0ChLa9aC2B5CvQoy380sQj4Re-Rsw.L90Gwd9rbYEvbw3rWrqEau1o37rJa1BqvPBRh571-rE&dib_tag=se&keywords=Luteolin+%2B+Rutin&qid=1731897971&sprefix=luteolin+%2B+rutin%2Caps%2C219&sr=8-5). Rutin is a nice thing to add...its a polyphenol. $0.19 each (again, off days only...due to the blunting effects on exercise). 
* CoQ10: Good that it's the active/reduced form and not yet another anti-oxidant. I take a higher dose from [Swanson](https://www.amazon.com/Swanson-Ubiquinol-100-Milligrams-Sgels/dp/B00VZYYTKW?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1&psc=1). You could match the dose, at 0.5 softgels per day for $0.18.
* Probiotics: Not needed for me, I eat lots of fermented foods daily (yogurt, sauerkraut, kombucha etc).
* Spermidine: It has very poor oral bioavailability, so I get it from foods. It's in mushrooms, legumes, whole grains, aged cheese - which I also consume for the C15 benefits! 
* Boron: [Life Extension](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LLYDEM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) Boron. I take 6mg per day as I try to unbind my testosterone a bit more. Cost $0.05 for 3mg.
* Lithium: I don't think it would benefit me, but its only $0.10 to replace the 1mg via [Life Extension](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Extension-Vegetarian-Capsules-02403/dp/B088KQFT74/ref=sr_1_6?crid=3DNQUOC4N28AG&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.O6AzcU6mBzGcFrvd3WnTVzLVOlwZGJ7otOCYn5qcqL19OnmDPi6N5AxL1yLhFGxQ3BZIH9Fb9nXMelmXX8r-gdIkX5tNhzSjh_N54yl8mtc2-nULo9x5wubb8a3r6Q-pwhXYzdcfICIs7VzcnePieGemrxk3r6GBZdB5uSOFmkBTRWYEPI6p8FEBMCuBE6O_xAvRlZKcraqJxcknnnOitQSbruVi_Z1kK0XuoO0KrrztOAfqeVC7FZzK8oj0i0CtR1YbzsQsOT1vd2X1hpyBzVgl9RYVQc2aHLCc9VU9PoA.IKQnY6Qr84a3TydeWP7AaB8C1BPmcPrGq0TwwkTxSSk&dib_tag=se&keywords=1mg+lithium&qid=1731898015&sprefix=1mg+lithium%2Caps%2C215&sr=8-6) if you want to. 

**Total Cost: $0.87 vs $1.55 per day**  
*Depending on your stance on daily antioxidants, NAD precursors, lithium and your diet, you may not be able to replace this stack 1:1 at the same cost or lower.*

Same dose of K1, lower doses of the two K2 forms, but that‚Äôs fine for me.
* Astaxanthin: [Sports Research](https://www.sportsresearch.com/products/astaxanthin-12mg). $0.33 each, same dose as Blueprint, but as a superior branded ingredient.
* Lutein / Zeaxanthin: [Sports Research](https://www.amazon.com/Zeaxanthin-Absorption-Certified-Verified-Softgels/dp/B07DFRQFQT/ref=sr_1_18?crid=3L4QPPY95T4P1&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.4DpQr6bS5bdbWPOPMjj2R98ijHqh7sYcGoVAnAI8ApNiq8Rho8S4TnZEXlZfXr0MRgJAAop_YNpvvd1mbMq5BbtEFjokyvHuOT9lyM_3tS_-Q5NThdSy34c8n4R70UJV5mO7UGGudwAX1wuj65dFRhSTXM9CLHZMIcVA9ACLnK43kRnH7nkOQs4Pu2zAQJQqM4y2eshnpfhaS7i0KLEsu0yhLQoR6_kK4LCxqfJyWPCdw983Q28J6KyK_JpiJzrOgHthOpKCpFyLnSzMOPYASFEcLRZWFzBrr00JwTHoyBc.-1pqIEHLFD6MkmJyDj5cYybiYCADIHjH-897kwUA8kk&dib_tag=se&keywords=Lutein&qid=1731897495&sprefix=lutein%2Caps%2C230&sr=8-18) $0.16 each. More of each ingredient, and in a superior branded format.
* Lycopene: I'll just eat tomatoes occasionally. 

**Total Cost: $0.69 vs $1.55 per day**  
*Pretty sure you can buy a small tomato for $0.76 per day*

Overall this saves me around $775/year, and gives me more control over what, and in what dose, I'm consuming. It's more work to manage, and requires I maintain my healthy diet, so YMMV if you try to copy this - which I don't recommend. Instead, I wrote this up as a resource, allowing you to pick and choose the things that make the most sense for you, given your unique needs and wants.

CITIZENS HAPPILY DESCEND INTO ALL-OUT DEBAUCHERY!,"If you‚Äôre a citizen of Metropolis, you already know how the morning routine‚Äôs supposed to go: You wake up at 6AM. You take an environmentally conscious sub four-minute shower. You take a leak that, in terms of both color and smell, your urologist ranks in the 99th percentile. You wash your hands for at least 20 seconds. You head down to the kitchen. You throw on a pot of decaf. And you start making breakfast as hubby and the kids file in and sit down at the kitchen table. 

The kids dutifully acknowledge the alert on their phones reminding them that school starts at 8AM sharp and that truancy is a misdemeanor. The oldest boy catches a whiff of breakfast, which prompts him to ask the same thing he always asks: ‚ÄúMom, why can‚Äôt we have Sugar Frosted Sugar Squares like the kids in Gotham?‚Äù Which prompts you to say the same thing you always say: ‚ÄúBecause, sweetie, we don‚Äôt live in Gotham. And Superman would throw us in the gulag.‚Äù

But this morning, things are different. You wake up at God knows what hour. Your  shower leaves a carbon footprint large enough to rival a developing nation. You take a piss that has both the hue and redolence of Tang. You bypass the sink without so much as a second thought. You galavant your way down to the kitchen. And you splash a little coffee in your gin before firing up the stove. 

Hubby and the kids come barreling in moments later, eyes glued to screens displaying live footage of an 18 foot radioactive lab rat surrounded by a rabid crowd encouraging him to chug a concoction of Sprite and Malt Liquor. The oldest boy glances up just long enough to ask: ‚ÄúMom, why isn‚Äôt Superman putting a stop to this?‚Äù And you can barely keep the smile from forming on your lips as you answer: ‚ÄúBecause, sweetie, Superman isn‚Äôt in charge anymore. Oh and also: fuck that guy.‚Äù

I've wanted to write and publish a book for my entire life, but naturally when I get free time I don't actually write lol. 

IF I can open my laptop and the writing program I use, I will write. So it's a matter of building the habit of just getting the damn laptop OPEN, and once I have that inertia, I will do it. Ideally in the mornings first thing, since I work 9-5.

One idea is this: I can't make coffee until I've opened the laptop. I'm fully addicted to coffee so this is a great reward/consequence, but also I know that I could just make coffee anyway.

What I need is an external source of the reward/consequence - a game/app for desktop, a person that I'm intimidated/low key scared of, or??? A secret third thing??

1gyw3jg,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gyw3jg/new_jobpet_loss_advice/,New job/pet loss advice?,"I (24f) started a new job at the beginning of the month.  Last Monday, my dog of 12 years passed away very unexpectedly and it has been the worst pain my family and I have felt in a long time. This dog was also my sisters soul dog/best friend, and she was already not super mentally stable before this, so to say that hasn‚Äôt added to the stress and sadness, I‚Äôd be lying. Like to the point where she‚Äôs saying she‚Äôd rather not live on anymore, so I‚Äôve been trying to be as present with her as I can to support her (I still live at home, she lives nearby). 

New job is hybrid with a 4 in/1 WFH day schedule, and it‚Äôs a 2 hour commute each way (that alone has been more than miserable). I had been unemployed for a year, so I needed to accept this as it was the first offer I had gotten and a 20k pay increase from my last. My job previous to this was fully remote, which I am now longing for again because this new job and commute is miserable. Everything about it is miserable except for the coffee machine they have there. I‚Äôve been crying almost daily this whole month, and this past week has made me realize how badly I miss the flexibility of my old job. 

This past week I also finagled my way into working remote for the entire week, and took a half day Monday and Tuesday off. It‚Äôs not like I was just being lazy and wanted to WFH, I have been an absolute mess and couldn‚Äôt/still cannot fathom being around people, especially strangers who don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm going through. I got a talk from my boss and his boss about my attendance and the importance of being present in the office on Wednesday/Thursday this week, which I do understand because it‚Äôs the company policy, yada yada, but it really just put a bad taste in my mouth because I was visibly crying on both calls while thanking them for their flexibility during this traumatic week. I still am a wreck and don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to go into the office and function this upcoming week. Yes I know the distraction would be helpful for a lot of people, but I have hated this new job since day 1.

Now for the actual question I want advice on: should I ask for my old job back? I am 100% willing to take the pay cut and I miss/need that kind of remote flexibility with everything going on in my life. I regret accepting this current job offer so so so much to be honest. I know anxiety and stress is expected within the first few months of a new job, but this is a whole new level that I know for a fact I cannot sustain. I ended on ok terms with my previous employer, and say ‚Äúok‚Äù because I could only do 1 week instead of 2 due to the new job I was supposed to start (that fell through the cracks and then I was unemployed lol). Is that a dumb idea? I wouldn‚Äôt quit current job until I had an offer from old one, but I could really use some advice as I have no idea what path to take right now. Thank you in advance.

Just for further info, it's an older house that has been split into 3 apartments. I have no idea what is going on in the other apartments. Two years ago I stayed here for a few months in the fall-winter season, and I didn't see any roaches. Other kinds of bugs are always getting in though... spiders, rolly looking bugs in the shower, centipedes, leaf-looking bugs, actual CRICKETS. So I know there are holes somewhere. Due to work, my father spends a lot of time in the city in an environment with a lot of roaches... it's possible he brought it/some home.

(Design inspired by old concept art of Richard Watterson)

Gender: Male

Also known as: Dad (Berry), Uncle (Gumball and Anais), Mr. Uncle (Darwin), Bro (Richard), Stu (Patricia), Stu-pid (Office Goblin), Stugart, Stuttgart, Stubert, Stuwart with a W, Stuheart, Stew Art, Chicken Stew, Steward, Stewart, Stewie, Stuartson, Artstu, Trauts, Traits, Trout, Samuel, Mr. Monroe, Mr. Moron (Office Goblin), Boss (co-workers), Fenrisulfr, Toothpick, Laboradory Dog and Johnny What's-His-Name

Species: Dog

Age: 35

Friends: Lenny Smith, Karen, Charlie, Martha Miller, Jeff Benson, Phil

Enemies: Alison Sandra Gator (Post-divorce Ex), Nicole (rarely), Office Goblin, Mr. Chanax

Relatives: Berry (daughter), Patricia (ex-wife), Gumball (nephew), Darwin (adoptive nephew), Anais (niece), Nicole (sister-in-law), Richard (brother-in-law)

Occupation: Middle Manager/Regional Manager

Voice: Kerry Shale (Alex Jordan kinda fits him too)



Stuart Monroe is the father of Berry, the maternal uncle of Gumball, Darwin and Anais, brother-in-law of Nicole and Richard and ex-husband of Patricia. Although one of the squarest, most non-nonsense man in Elmore, everyone in the city finds him incredibly dull and forgettable, including his own family (Berry & Patricia cannot forget him,obviously, and the Wattersons do make an effort...often unsuccessfully). Stuart's most noticeable flaw is that, when he's dedicated to something, the whole world disappears to him (and he's workaholic, so that's not a great match). He works at Chanax Inc. as middle manager.

Most episodes featuring Mr. Monroe has him being kindhearted, optimistic and chill, until shenanigans happen and he loses his cool, becoming mostly jaded, snarky and/or distressed. By the final two seasons, he's pretty much tired of Elmore (*specially* with Chanax Inc). 



SPOILERS to the end of Stuart's character arc:

>!In his final episode in S6, he would finally burn out like Banana Barbara did, adopt the secret identity ""Fenrisulfr"", and plot to have the building of Chanax Inc. literally sent to space (only shareholders and bosses would've been there). The Wattersons attempt to stop him (also because Carmen's dad is part of the bosses), but fail because he's planned and predicted every scenario for the past 5 years. What he didn't predict is that Richard Watterson cannot be predicted, as he is chaos personified. They finally reach the upper levels to warn everyone, but they're laughed off (Carmen's dad believes them and accompanies them out, so...mission accomplished?). Back outside, Berry would talk to Stuart and ask him not to become like her and Patricia, because she NEEDS a role model in her life. Mr. Monroe would then go back to his senses and surrender himself to the authorities (one of the dumb cops finds Stuart's remote control, sets it off by mistake and, just like that, Chanax Inc. goes up in the air). Berry Monroe would then spend the final 10\~5 episodes of Season 6 living with the Wattersons. In this AU's Season 7, Stuart would be hired as a teacher at Elmore Junior High and become romantically involved with Mr. Small. Chanax Inc. would probably be back, without any explanation whatsoever, and have either Mr. Verde or Felicity Parham (like in the OG universe) as the middle manager.!<



Favorite hobbies: Reading non-fiction books, hard science fiction books and the daily newspaper; studying economy, politics, sociology, physics, geology, etc.; gardening; doing crosswords; doing taxes and knitting.

Favorite Movie genres: Sci-Fi (a massive ""Star Trek"" fan, as well as a Stellar Odyssey one, but less so)

Favorite TV shows/channels: Documentaries, TV News, Sci-Fi shows and Shopping Channel

Least Favorite TV shows: Trivia Shows

Conditions: Severe Myopia, hypertension, asthma, allergies, OCD, anxiety disorder, autism(?) and ""Sleepworking"".

Favorite drinks: Coffee (when it's work time, which is 23/7); Tea (when it's relaxing time, which is 1/7)

Favorite Music Genres: Classical, Blues, Jazz & Reggae

Halloween Costume: The Ghouls (Mad Scientist)

Weight: Literally light as a feather

Strenght: Weaker than a zooplankton

Intelligence: Second most intelligent member of the whole family (Anais is the first)



(Ever seen ""What We do in the Shadows""? He's basically Colin Robinson, but much MUCH less of a jerk. And much more of a woobie)



(Fun Fact: Both Berry and Stuart never interact with Richard's side of the family. This prevents both from appearing too much and overshadowing/being overshadowed by Granny Jojo, Louie and Frankie, narratively speaking. In Season 6, a Thanksgiving episode would have the family putting aside their differences for Richard's sake. >!Daniel, Mary and Patricia wouldn't be around though!<)(Although I think the same premise with Nicole's parents vs. Richard's, in the OG show we watch, would work pretty well)



\[TL;DR: Richard Watterson's foil; what Anais *could* grow up to be\]

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I‚Äôm looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I‚Äôm not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I‚Äôm very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific ‚Äútype‚Äù of person! I‚Äôm looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I‚Äôm not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn‚Äôt?) - I‚Äôm definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I‚Äôm a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I‚Äôm very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you‚Äôd be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I‚Äôve mentioned in my post, it‚Äôs up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on ‚Äúhey‚Äù or smalltalk responses.

While getting my drink, I had a nice interaction with the bartender. He smiled at me in a way that felt warm and interested. As he handed me the coffee, he complimented my smile, saying, ‚ÄúWow, you have a very nice smile.‚Äù I returned the compliment, and we flirted a little.

When I finished my drink, I brought the cup back to him and told him how delicious it was. This led to even more flirting, and then he said, ‚ÄúYou know what? Here is my Instagram. Write me if you want, and we can meet up.‚Äù He suggested a potential sexual encounter.

Now I‚Äôm unsure what to do. He‚Äôs 100% my type‚Äîvery attractive‚Äîbut I‚Äôm worried about the consequences. What if we meet and it doesn‚Äôt go well? Would it make things awkward for me to visit the sauna again in the future?

I‚Äôd love to hear your advice. How would you handle this situation?",7,1732467991.0,AskGaybrosOver30,18,0.67,False

1gyvrcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1gyvrcq/long_living_room_troubles/,Long living room troubles,"Hello - your help is highly needed please :-)

I recently moved into a house for the first time. I'm having troubles decorating the living room. I hope someone can give me good ideas/pointers. 

I'm single and have been for the last couple of years. (not looking to change that.) 
I (almost) also never get any visitors so this living room is 99,9% for myself - but I would still like to keep it nice and cozy, and being able to host guests from time to time.

[This is an overview of the living room](https://i.imgur.com/r7H4GIq.jpeg). It's 340 x 150 inches (865x383 cm.)

   
I want to use the living room to chill in. I like to listen to music and work/play on the computer. I also occasionally watch movies. I'm writing this to say that I don't think a classic setup with sofas pointed at each other would work here. 

My prolems are, that I tend to place all furniture against the wall and I decorate in an... *utilitarian style*. It tends to end up with cold rooms with lots of wasted space. 

I think the room is difficult to decorate because there's so many doors and windows. 

Right not I have just *thrown* my furniture into the room, just to test. I placed the speakers etc. first and then placed the sofa in the middle of the room. [1: It looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/zKIwVlY.jpeg) 

[2: Here it is a little bit closer](https://i.imgur.com/0Z84QKw.jpeg)

[3: And this is towards the opposite side](https://i.imgur.com/gqOQMAW.jpeg)

-- 

So my idea right now is to place the computer desk up towards the back of the sofa, and then in the empty end get a couple of chairs, move the coffee table up there and have a small cozy area. That way I can also enjoy listening to music from the computer if I want to. But I have my doubts if it will work/look nice or be weird.

--  

Another idea is to use the empty end for the desk and computer and have it separated from the ""cozy end"", and maybe place a couple of small armchairs behind the sofa pointing the other way (mostly for decoration and not for being used).

--  

I hope I make sense and that someone can see what I need and not what I'm trying to convey on my bad English. :-)

1gyvp73,https://www.reddit.com/r/PHCreditCards/comments/1gyvp73/newly_issued_bdo_cc_fraud/,Newly issued BDO CC fraud,"Ok before i start, oo na ang b0b0 ko sa ikkwento ko HAHA :(  
Ive had my bdo CC for almost 2 years, so nagpa-upgrade ako. I picked up my new card sa BDO ESTRADA BRANCH (Taft avenue 2nd floor. Tapat ng lasalle) YES name drop ng branch dahil sila ang suspetya ko

Hindi naman ako baguhan sa card. Im actually a content creator on tikt0k my niche is financial literacy. So 2 days after getting my new card, may nareceive akong alert from BDO about a 2 USD purchase from a coffee shop in the US. Gulat ako kasi never naman ako naka expeience ng ganto in 2 years of having a cc.

So inisip ko lahat ng mga possibleng cause bakit may parasite na nakapasok. Mind you, isang transaction palang nagagawa ko sa card which is a ‚Ç±152 coffee. Naalala ko bigla nung pinick up ko yung card ko sa bdo estrada eh pinaopen sakin nung teller. Ginawa ko naman syempre to see ano itsura ng card. Sitting inside the bank, while talking to the teller, i was also preoccupied answering urgent emails on my phone. At bigla ako sinabihan ni teller na ‚Äúmaam pahiram muna po, pipicturan ko lang‚Äù. Nag hesitate ako nung una. Kasi girl yan ang number 1 na wag na wag mong gagawin: Wag padaanin sa kamay ng iba ang card mo. Pero inisip ko din na ‚Äúok lang naman siguro. I can trust her naman since teller sya at mukhang marangal naman‚Äù. I was wrong lmao

after reading threads here on reddit and tiktok, ang daming nagsusupect na inside job yung unauathorized transactions nila. Yes the transactinwas made in the US BUT I JUST LEARNED RECENTLY THAT THE ‚Äúinside workers‚Äù can pass it on to an expert and they will do the rest.

apparently, and thankfully, test transaction palang yung ginawa sa card ko kaya 2x sila nag charge ng 1usd each.

what did i do after leaning about the unathorized transaction?

1. Locked my card in the bdo online app immediately
2. called customer service, asked them to block my card PERMANENTLY. 1 minute later, my card was blocked and they already issued a delivery of my new card
3. changed my bdo app password
4. Set the withdraw limit and other debit limits lower. In case magka fraud sa debit naman. Mas mahirap solusyonan pag debit
5. \[di ko pa nagagawa to bukas palang\] tatawagan ang bdo estrada branch at pag mumurahin. Char
6. bumili ng stickers for card details na anti scatch sa shopee

My tip if this happens to you is to stay calm and have presence of mind. Ibabalik  naman ng bangko yung pera basta alert ka at hindi tatanga tanga like me

ayoko pa sana ipablock yung card kasi gagamitin ko for airport lounge sa trip ko tomorrow kaso pucha para maka kain ng libreng siomai sa paggs eh makakabayad pa ng 50k fraud in the future",1,1732467722.0,PHCreditCards,3,1.0,False
1gyvocn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1gyvocn/the_habit_spiral_loss_of_control_or_unrealistic/,The Habit Spiral: Loss of Control or Unrealistic Ideal?,"Let‚Äôs imagine a person who used to drink a little too much from time to time. One day, this person decides to quit drinking because they feel that alcohol has too much influence on their actions.

At first, they successfully abstain from alcohol, but eventually, they give in and have a beer with a friend. Afterwards, they feel frustrated with themselves because they believe they‚Äôve broken their self-imposed ‚Äúvow.‚Äù However, it remains just one beer ‚Äì the person doesn‚Äôt come home drunk. Couldn‚Äôt this even be seen as progress? After all, it seems like they have the situation under control, doesn‚Äôt it?

Over time, though, drinking beer becomes a habit again until the person eventually decides to quit alcohol once more. This time, it works out well for a while: they feel good, free, and self-determined. Even when socializing with friends, they manage to stay strong and not drink beer. But eventually, they begin to miss the pleasure of having a beer and, after a long period of abstinence, give in once more. The old pattern starts all over again: they feel frustrated with themselves, guilty, and conflicted about their decision.

**The question is:**  
Does this person have an alcohol problem that they need to address seriously and completely give up alcohol?  
Or do they perhaps have an unrealistic ideal in mind, from which they need to free themselves and instead learn to accept who they are?

**Additional consideration:**  
What happens if we replace beer in this example with another habit ‚Äì such as morning coffee or a daily sweet treat? Would the answers to these questions change due to bias? Or would these habits need to be assessed in a different context?

What if, instead of beer, it was hard drugs like heroin, with the amount consumed being the same as in the beer scenario? Would that change our perspective on the answers to these questions?

  
How would you approach getting to the root of this problem? What criteria or standards should be applied to evaluate this behavior?",1,1732467668.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False
1gyvo0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsbCHardware/comments/1gyvo0k/are_there_any_power_strips_with_multiple_power/,Are there any power strips with multiple Power Delivery outlet capabilities or not so much?,"Howdy folks,

Hope all is well, I apologize if this isnt the right place to ask but Im not sure if theres a better sub.

I have a Dell laptop, and a few Powerbanks:

\-RavPower RP-PB043

\-Anker A1291

\-Pxwaxpy HX160Q1

\-The Ravpower Ive had for years (and bought for Quickcharging a Nintendo switch portable when I put one in the back of car when I was Lyft driving), I bought the Pxwaxpy for a powerbank for my ex since shed always use the Rav to charge hers, lol (relationship ended before Christmas, when she was going to get it), and I bought the Anker as basically backup battery for my laptop which is a Dell 7490 (so it can be charged through USB C).

Nonetheless, Ive been a bit of a nomad for a bit and hit up libraries or coffee shops to work on different things. Ill use a portable monitor with the laptop or possible a Vizio monitor/tv I grabbed from Goodwill haha. I have an Amazon power strip that has maybe 6 ac outlets or so and two usb ports for charging devices (which ill either use to charge my phone or possibly the powerbanks or whatever have you).

Now, Im curious about getting a power strip with possibly more usb outlets-which I have another one with me I'll use for AV gear with at least twice the amount of AC outlets and 4 usb charging ports.

Nonetheless, a part of me would love to grab a power strip with possibly more ports or at the least-possibly one that had more usb ports that could charge items faster (like as if it had MULTIPLE power delivery charging ports or something).

Tl;dr- Essentially, Im wondering if there is a power strip out there with multiple FAST charging USB ports or if theres possibly one with multiple power delivery level ports?

Yes Anker gives you a PD adapter so you can charge the 1291 faster-and I will test how much faster it can charge the Ravpower than the standard USB C cable-but I dont wanna have to lug around multiple PD adapters if I dont have to....

Does anyone know if something like that exists or not?",1,1732467648.0,UsbCHardware,1,0.67,False
1gyvnf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1gyvnf2/unsatisfactory_aeropress_results/,Unsatisfactory Aeropress results ,"Quick background: Got nerdy about good coffee during pandemic. Love high-quality specialty beans but dislike the fussiness and extra equipment required with pour-over and espresso brewing. So basically I love great coffee but I want to get there in the easiest/cheapest/least-fussy way possible. 

This brought me to the Clever Dripper, which I bought two years ago and has been my main method of brewing since then. I love it. No fancy goosenecks or espresso machines required, just good beans, good grinder and good water. 20g medium-fine to 300g water-in-first method, ~94¬∞C, 2:30 steep, ~30-40sec draw down. Makes a deliciously sweet brew with perfect balance between body and nuanced complexity. 

About 10 days ago I finally bought an Aeropress. Since then I‚Äôve been falling down the recipe rabbit hole. I‚Äôve tried at least 10 different recipes with varying grind size, water temps, ratios, by-pass, etc. I can‚Äôt seem to get the same wonderful balance I get from my Clever Dripper. The brews I am getting with my Aeropress aren‚Äôt horrible but they almost always turn out with a super heavy syrupy body which seems to drown out all the complexities of the beans I‚Äôm using. Either that, or I dial the recipes back so much that they feel kind of empty and under extracted. I‚Äôve yet to find that perfect balance that I get with my clever dripper. 

Anyone have any suggestions here??? I guess I‚Äôm just going to stick with my clever dripper!

Let me break down why Bitcoin Cash (BCH) could be the better choice for you:

1. Lower Transaction Fees

BTC: Average fees can range from $1 to $30 depending on network congestion. Imagine paying $10 to send $50‚Äîridiculous! üò¨

BCH: Transaction fees are consistently less than $0.01. Whether you‚Äôre sending $5 or $5,000, it‚Äôs cost-effective.

2. Faster Transactions

BTC: With 10-minute block times (or longer during busy periods), waiting for confirmations can feel like an eternity.

BCH: BCH transactions are processed much faster due to its larger block size and less congested network. Perfect for real-world use cases like buying coffee or sending payments instantly.

3. Scaled for Everyday Use

BTC: Due to its smaller block size (1MB), BTC struggles to handle a large volume of transactions, leading to delays and higher fees.

BCH: With an 8MB block size, Bitcoin Cash is designed to handle more transactions per second, making it a better fit for daily use.

4. Preserves the Original Vision of Bitcoin

Bitcoin Cash stays true to Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs vision of a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. BTC, on the other hand, has shifted toward being a ‚Äústore of value‚Äù like digital gold‚Äîgreat for hodling, not for spending.

5. Wider Adoption for Payments

BCH is being accepted by more merchants and payment processors worldwide. Its low fees and fast confirmations make it ideal for real-world transactions.

6. Decentralized and Secure

Just like BTC, Bitcoin Cash is decentralized and secure, leveraging the same proof-of-work consensus mechanism. You get the same security without the unnecessary costs.

The Bottom Line

Bitcoin Cash is simply more practical for everyday transactions. While BTC might be good for holding and speculation, BCH fulfills the original promise of cryptocurrency: fast, cheap, and reliable payments for everyone, everywhere.

So, next time you‚Äôre looking to send money or make a payment, give Bitcoin Cash (BCH) a try. It‚Äôs cryptocurrency the way it was meant to be. üåç‚ú®

1gyvizm,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1gyvizm/instant_coffee_power_trip/,Instant Coffee Power Trip,"I have ADD. When I was a teenager, I took medication, to keep me focused enough to function. Sometimes I would run out. These things happen. Given my issues with executive dysfunction, I needed to have something in place as a backup, just in case there was a problem with my prescription. 

Right about this time, in the 90s, a fancy brand of instant coffee came out, that had various flavors. Pretty good stuff. But definitely coffee. The same amount of caffeine as you‚Äôd expect. 

My dad was in the kitchen one day, when he saw me put a tin of said coffee in the cupboard. He asked me what it was and I told him. He perked up and said maybe he‚Äôll have some with breakfast in the morning. I told him that it was my emergency backup, for when I was out of medication. 

When I made it clear that it was something that my mom bought for me, he took on  this really weird demeanor and started talking with this overly elegant tone. He told me that technically, he earns the money in the family. So technically he bought it. Then he began declaring dramatically, how he was going to make an amazing cup of coffee for himself. 

He was carrying on, despite my protests and making a big deal about ‚Äúif there‚Äôs none left for you in an emergency, oh well!‚Äù This went in circles, with him being more and more insistent, that I had no right to claim anything in the house as actually mine. That he paid for everything. So if I hid it from him, that he‚Äôd trash my room looking for it and then throw it away and tell my mom not to buy any more for me, so I‚Äôd never have it again. Then he started wondering aloud, how many scoops of it he would put in his morning coffee, and how maybe there was enough to last him a few days. 

I was dreading the thought of being without medication and having no backup options. I was actually sobbing and begging him not to take this stuff from me. My dad actually liked black coffee, but it was like he just wanted to do this, just to try and make me feel powerless to stop him. The whole thing went late into the night, with me just asking him not to. We both yelled each other hoarse over it. 

The next morning, my dad used some of this coffee powder. But for some reason, he had it in his head, that it was just coffee flavoring. He probably added it with gusto, though there was still plenty of powder in the tin. Plus a little built in payback. As in, I didn‚Äôt have to do anything. 

My dad probably used about three servings of this powder in his coffee. Yes, he added it into his already strong, black coffee. He doesn‚Äôt drink a small cup either. He was wired, jittery, jumpy and he had the shits. He‚Äôs lucky he had a bathroom nearby. The funniest part, was that I‚Äôd forgotten all about this yelling match (because they were so common). I only found out about all this, because I was home after school and my mom was belly-laughing on the phone. 

My mom filled me in on the details. She also told me that my dad admitted that he could see why I was telling him not to add it to his coffee. He told my mom that he thought I was being selfish, when I was partially trying to tell him that it was flavored coffee and not coffee flavor. He thought it was weird that I was being so protective of vanilla powdered creamer. 

After his literally shitty day, he never came at me about the powdered coffee. He didn‚Äôt mention it for a while, but instead bought me one of every flavor and never touched the stuff again. All he said was that he sees why I kept it as a backup for my meds, and ‚ÄúThat stuff is no joke!‚Äù",6,1732467303.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False

A little backstory: I failed my Glucose 1hr miserably. As we all know, there‚Äôs a high anticipation to fail the Glucose 3hr. Between both tests, I decided to research many subgroups and fb pages to see what I can learn from all of you. So far, what I learned was:

1. Eggs suck
2. Everyone is different and what spikes one person may not spike someone else
3. Fairlife Core Power protein drinks are LIFE

After everything I learned, I changed my routine and diet. Went to my Glucose 3hr and PASSED ü§Ø My biggest fears throughout all of this was:

1. I don‚Äôt want to end up like my mom: uncontrolled diabetes, end stage renal failure, blind and wheelchair/bed bound at age 64. 
2. Having to take insulin and develop type 2 diabetes after birth 
3. Induction and Cesarean 

So I‚Äôve decided to stay on this lifestyle change and after birth continue on this journey for optimal health, post baby milk production and weightloss, to prevent further medical conditions. 

I created a diary and I wanted to share it with all of you. Tweak it if you need to depending on what spikes or doesn‚Äôt spike you. I promise eggs aren‚Äôt terrible, walking is important but CRUCIAL right after eating and a cup of coffee diluted with water won‚Äôt hurt the bebe.

I was looking forward to the IMAM Fall Exchange for *months*, and hoo boy did it not disappoint! Thanks to the coordinators for matching me with the magnificent u/mynameisnotbenny ! I am forever thankful and happy to have met someone who has grounded me and makes every conversation feel like a hot cup of tea with an old friend after a brisk walk through the forest. We have a good amount in common, but also vary in ways that make us our own, and I love hearing about these different interests and experiences! Incredibly kind, patient, sweet, and probably knows what I like better than I do, because what a delightful gift I‚Äôve been sent!

*The 2024 IMAM Exchange included:*

* **A medieval notecard**: Both pleasantly creepy and my kind of historical vibe
* **Botanical stickers**: That I‚Äôve already stuck onto my \~decorative office storage box\~ with select other cool stickers
* **Earth & Anchor Incense** \- Elderflower: This is the most lovely floral incense I‚Äôve ever encountered! It has such a light-scented smoke, like white petals drifting in a spring breeze. It burns quite long, too!
* **Hand-knit bookmark**: It‚Äôs very sentimental to me because of the pattern and color, but also HOW TALENTED is mynameisnotbenny for making this?? (I read a fair amount, so a bookmark is perfect)
* **Blood Moon Botanica**: *Ponderosa, Sepia Lace, Blood Moon*
* **Cardinal Scents**: *Morning Paper, Ghost Story, Gentle Reader*
* **Deconstructing Eden**: *√Åine, Chuseok, Coastal, Gr√°inne N√≠ Mh√°ille, Lighthouse, Pumpkin's Revenge, Season of the Witch*

*Note*: I have not tested all the scents, but upon a quick sniff of all of them, I am very pleased! My requests were all over the place (my partner is such a saint for having little direction and still nailing it!) but I had included aquatic, witchy, pumpkin, and greens as some of my preferences.  My love of Celtic & Korean cultures and cold, salty seas were also incorporated! All these houses are new to me, so I look forward to exploring them further - happy to provide any first impressions or reviews :)

Also included were some very tasty items I have stashed away in my secret snack drawer to nibble on when I feel like a special treat:

* **Tavernier Chocolates** \- The BrattleBar
* **Loon Chocolate** \- Maple Crunch bar
* **Loon Chocolate** \- Dark Chocolate Espresso Beans
* **Terra Nova Coffee** \- Red House

(I am a coffee and dark chocolate fiend so these really fit my taste!)

Without being too long-winded: I could not have asked for a more wonderful soul to have met and befriended! 100/10, would exchange again. Thank you, u/mynameisnotbenny!! You truly are a wonderful human to have in the world üíö",19,1732467145.0,Indiemakeupandmore,1,1.0,False

Parents and I have been bearing it so far. There are episodes everyday when he'd shout at me or my mother (I'm guessing he is in the early stages of becoming an incel) and coz we don't want him to turn violent, we'd just be silent. 

Today he hit me quite violently for a very silly reason. It is always the smallest of reasons for which he gets angry - less salt in food, rice being mushy, adding less sugar to coffee - things similar to that. He also gets angry when we don't listen to his advice or when his orders are not carried out immediately. To give context, he hasn't been working in the last 10 years, stays with parents, mother gives him money, zero social circle, no discipline in life - wakes up at whatever time he chooses,  keeps watching sports/movies/YouTube, eats whenever he is hungry, sleeps whenever he wants to. Initially he wanted to make a career change and quit his decent paying job. He wanted to get into creative fields. Months became years and he's not doing anything about his life. Zero girlfriends as well. He is living far from reality. Couple of my close friends suggested he has mental disorder and needs therapy but he thinks he's normal and gets violent whenever I bring up therapy. He weighs over 110 kg as of now.

After he hit me (on head, face, back, arms) and almost choked me, I was afraid to stay in the same house as him and called the police to lodge a domestic violence case. The police were swift to act, and warned him against anything. They also asked me if I wanted to go ahead and write a case. And they would take care of him. I didn't want anything of that sort. I was/am only hoping he won't hit/kill me. 

I want to know what will happen if I give a written case when he hits me again. I know he will because every 3 days he gets violently angry. Today was just too much and i replied back that he shouldn't get angry for silly reasons and he hit me. He's a violent person and he will definitely hit me/any family member for sure anytime in the future. 

Is there anyway to legally disown him - to not do anything with him anymore? As far my parents are concerned (both of them well educated), he is always violent and I should be careful to not say anything coz what will society say. Today too, my mother told I did a mistake in calling the police. I asked her what she'd say if he had killed me. She had no answer to that. 

The amount of mental, emotional and physical abuse this person has given me and my parents is immense. I want to erase him off my life. And I also want to stay away from parents coz they are enabling his behaviour. I agree they're old but not saying that he's in the wrong is making him to continue being the angry violent person. Is there a way I can get a stay order for my family to not contact me unless there is an emergency? 

I've lost precious years in trying to be the peace maker, and it has cost me a lot mentally and emotionally. A part of me is so broken it can't be fixed. 

I do not want any of my parents' assets/money. I only hope I can be able to live my life peacefully without emotional/physical abuse anymore. Please give legal advice. ",1,1732466815.0,LegalAdviceIndia,1,1.0,False

1gyv79t,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1gyv79t/harmony_of_the_seas_review/,Harmony of the Seas Review ,"My husband and I recently returned from a fantastic 7-day cruise on the Harmony of the Seas. Having previously sailed on the Odyssey OTS, NCL Prima, and Breakaway, we can confidently say that Harmony is our second favorite, with NCL Prima holding the top spot.

**The Cruise**


Our cruise took us to Roatan, Costa Maya, and Cozumel from Galveston. Despite sailing during a tropical storm, the captain skillfully navigated us to calmer waters.

**Staff**: The crew was fantastic, attentive, and fun. The entertainment staff, in particular, was a highlight.

**Entertainment**: We enjoyed the Grease show, ice skating performances, and game shows. Unfortunately, we weren't able to attend the diving show or comedy acts.

**Food**: The food was decent, but the upgraded steaks were exceptional. The drink package was well worth it, we drank coffees, juices, waters and alcohol throughout the cruise without a care in the world. 

**Cabin**: Although we normally sail with a balcony, we decided to try out an interior  room for this cruise. We were assigned a room with a  virtual balcony. While the virtual balcony was a nice touch, the constant ambient light was a bit annoying. The room felt really small, but we were able to keep it organized and didn‚Äôt spend a ton of time in there anyway.

**Public Spaces**: We spent a lot of time in the solarium, enjoying the hot tubs. A future addition of a pool would be a great improvement. While the ship offered plenty of activities, we missed the more intimate connection to the ocean found on previous cruises.

**App**: My app never worked properly for the full sailing, so I wasn‚Äôt able to use in app messaging, reserve shows or schedule dining. Thankfully, my husband‚Äôs worked, so we were still able to make necessary plans. 

**The Ports**


**Roatan**: We took a short walk to a monkey and sloth experience. While the experience was enjoyable, the port itself was a bit overwhelming.

**Costa Maya**: We took a short cab ride to the Krazy Lobster, they have a nice, free beach with a purchase. Great service and food. 

**Cozumel**: We rented a jeep and explored the island, stopping at various beaches and restaurants.

Overall, our Harmony of the Seas cruise was a wonderful experience. The ship's size and amenities were impressive, but we missed the more intimate connection to the ocean found on previous cruises.",14,1732466482.0,royalcaribbean,8,1.0,False

From a suburb on the east coast to a medium sized city on the west coast. I moved to my current location in 2020. I will have rent covered for one year, and then be on my own.

I don't require much support when I live at home. For a long time and to an extent still, if my father is away for a long time and isn't bringing me food, I simply don't eat anything for days. Over time, I mapped out many of the roads in my town so I know all the places I can drive to without going through stop lights or making left turns, which helped me a lot. There are a few paths around the house I developed where I pace and stim. I have a lot of little rituals, like running the coffee maker while pacing back and forth and then restarting it. The area aside from planes, distant cars, air conditioning, and the refrigerator is quiet. I keep all the blinds closed and am familiar with all of my things. There are a lot of things that helped me that took years to develop.  

I'm 23 and never held a job and can't make it past interview. The few times I've lived on my own I required significantly more support. Just imagining the ambiguous situations makes me spiral into becoming really upset very quickly. I genuinely don't know how I'm supposed to do this. One little thing would very very easily cascade into homelessness. Something as small as my neighbor being out of their apartment, a light shining into my room, everything just being too loud and too much would snowball into me losing everything. This all assumes I can get a job at all and that that job is something I can manage.

While I still have support before I move out, I want to seek a diagnosis as it could help at the extremes. Is it possible to get one in the Washington DC area in two months? 

Some other questions;

For those who struggle with independent living, how did you handle moving out?

 The Sawgrass SG1000 for sublimation (mostly for mousepads and some hard objects like coffee mugs, some other hard objects). This is around $1.5k.

1gyux09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teambuilding/comments/1gyux09/virtual_group_activities_that_do_well_for_team/,Virtual group activities that do well for team building,"Since this week's theme is virtual group and teambuilding activities, we'll talk more about it here. Virtual group activities offer a great way to maintain a bond with friends, family, or coworkers, no matter where they‚Äôre located. Here are some great virtual activities that can help bring people together (digitally).

* **Holiday-Themed Events -** If you‚Äôre looking to add some seasonal cheer to your gatherings, virtual holiday-themed events like Secret Santa or White Elephant gift exchanges where everyone opens gifts on camera is fun for everyone. For a creative challenge, try a gingerbread house decorating competition where everyone can share their sweet creations on screen!¬†
* **Arts and Crafts -** A virtual arts and crafts session brings out everyone‚Äôs inner artist. Think a guided paint and sip or pottery class. Send a small kit in advance or share a list of supplies beforehand. It‚Äôs a calming, hands-on way to create something special together, and everyone ends up with a keepsake from the experience.
* **Cooking and Baking Classes -** Nothing brings people together quite like food, and virtual cooking and baking classes are a fantastic way to share a meal, even remotely! Choose a recipe in advance, and either send out ingredient kits or let participants shop for ingredients themselves. Options like holiday cookies, pizza-making, or even cocktails are great choices.¬†
* **Virtual Escape Rooms -** For a bit of adventure, try a virtual escape room! Escape rooms are now available online, allowing teams to solve puzzles, uncover clues, and race against the clock to ‚Äúescape‚Äù from a themed room. It‚Äôs an exciting, high-energy activity that encourages teamwork and problem-solving, making it perfect for both friends and coworkers.¬†
* **Trivia Night -** Trivia nights are ideal for a dose of friendly competition. You can do them over Zoom with categories like pop culture, history, or even custom questions about your group. To add to the fun, offer small prizes for the top scorers or include bonus rounds for extra points. Trivia works well because everyone can play along easily, whether they‚Äôre on a laptop or phone.
* **Food and Drink Tastings -** Virtual tastings are a hit with groups who enjoy exploring flavors together. For a non-alcoholic option, try a hot chocolate or coffee tasting, where participants sample different types or flavors. For a more adult twist, wine and cheese tastings are popular, as are cocktail-making sessions.¬†
* **Meditation and Wellness Sessions -** For groups seeking relaxation and mindfulness, meditation or wellness sessions are a wonderful choice. Many instructors offer virtual classes that include guided meditation, breathwork, and simple stretches. Wellness sessions are a favorite with teams in high-stress environments, helping everyone recharge and focus.

These virtual group activities make it easy to stay connected and bond with your team from home. Drop a comment about what you like to do with your team! ",2,1732465779.0,Teambuilding,0,1.0,False

How would you make this? Looking for ratios mainly. I can handle the blueberry simple syrup myself. Make my own syrups for coffee/lattes at home. 

My thinking.

2 oz Tito's vodka 
1 oz st germain elderflower
1 oz fresh lemon juice or grapefruit would be good. 
1/2 oz blueberry syrup (homemade)

Shake with ice then strain into coup or on the rock. Garnish with lemon twist and blueberry skewer.

I (m/54) had been thinking for a while, that people always beat around the bush when dating instead of getting to the point and decided to do it differently. I was living in Boston for two months and had arranged to meet Lisa (not her real name, f/43) for the second time. She had her brown hair tied back in a ponytail, a great sense of humor and a nice smile. On our first date, we had talked for a long time and kissed goodbye.

That evening, I invited her to dinner at Legal Seefoods. She was wearing a pleated skirt down to her knee, a white turtleneck sweater and a blazer over it. When the waiter brought the aperitif, she looked at me mischievously and asked me what I had planned for the evening? Fine, I thought, if she wants to know. I said I'd text her, I didn't want to talk about it. She frowned and laughed. I took my cell phone and texted her ‚ÄúI plan to fuck you‚Äù. She choked on the margherita and turned bright red. I asked her if she wanted to order an appetizer. Then the next text message. ‚ÄúBefore dessert, I plan to ask you to go to the bathroom, take off your bra and bring it to me.‚Äù She bursted out laughing.

After the starter, the next message, ‚ÄúI'll take you home after dinner. If you offer me a coffee, I'll come with you.‚Äù A quiet smile, ‚Äúand then?‚Äù comes back. As I type, we talk about this and that. The main course arrives. Before I start eating I type the next message.

‚ÄúWhile you make coffee, I will kiss your neck and press myself against you. I caress your breasts and slide my hand under your chic black skirt.‚Äù

She reads while eating, chokes and coughs. ‚ÄúAnd then?‚Äù comes back.

‚ÄúWe'll have coffee in your living room.‚Äù Sending, humming. She laughs.

‚ÄúAnd then I'll fuck your brains out  on the sofa.‚Äù

She switches off her cell phone. We eat in silence, some shy looking in the eyes here and there. I say that the fish is delicious. Her hands shake a little as she cuts the potatoes. She orders another glass of white wine.

The waiter asks if we want dessert. We both want it and order it, but no coffee. We laugh at the waiter's joke. When he's gone, I say, ‚ÄúTime for the bathroom.‚Äù She blushes, gets up and leaves. She leaves her blazer where it is. When she comes back, she has red dimples. She walks tall and proud and is clearly not wearing a bra under her turtleneck. She has crumpled up the bra in her hand and presses it into my hand under the table.

Dessert arrives and we let each other taste it. The older man at the next table looks at her nipples poking through the sweater. I pay and we take a cab to her place.

The first time she came in front of the coffee machine was when I penetrated her with two fingers. Then the coffee was ready. We then went into the living room with the coffee and drank it on the sofa, kissed and a little later I took her from behind, her pumps still on, her skirt and sweater pushed up, her head pressed into the pillows. She was loud. Then we showered together before I took a cab to my hotel.

1gyuo7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianmedschool/comments/1gyuo7b/life_after_taking_mbbs/,Life after taking mbbs. ,"Ok so I‚Äôve come across a lot of views about how people are really confused about taking medical so here‚Äôs some first hand experience. 

I belong to a non medico family, i had zero experience about any of it. In 11th i took biology just because i liked the subject and slowly got inclined towards taking medical. A lot of people discouraged me, and tbh half of them were doctors themselves. I didn‚Äôt understand the depth of it and went for it. I‚Äôm currently in 2nd yr. And lemme tell you, it is not easy. But i can‚Äôt imagine myself doing anything else but this. 

First year was hell. Keeping all the fun in the hostel and with friends aside, study wise it was wayy too difficult for me. Everything was so fuxkin different than school, No spoon feeding at all. Teachers treat you like shit ngl. They disrespect you, they shout at you in front of everyone. I‚Äôve never got a punishment in my whole school life but boom the first week of college and i was sent out of the lecture hall by my anatomy HOD. Plus the books, the DH, the practicals they are all a lot to take in. The monthly tests, failing them miserably, sleepless nights, unlimited amount of tiredness, it just all makes it really difficult to survive. Plus the competition around really makes thing worse. The whole year went like this, then came prelims, i kinda died lmao. And then immediately after 2 weeks we had 1st professional exams. Now those 17 days were the worst. But somehow i managed to get distinction in all 3 subjects and the feeling of passing was surreal. 

Now whatever i said above was reality. But i would not change a single thing about it. I‚Äôm a whole different person. All this makes you stronger, confident, makes you learn how to deal with things in such a better way. You find a side of yourself you didn‚Äôt even know existed. The amount of happiness you get when you first hold a human heart in your hand, the rush you feel when you see the brain, it‚Äôs unmatchable. The late night study sessions, the happiness you get when you see 51/100 in your tests, again there‚Äôs nothing like it. 

Now when I‚Äôm in 2nd year, we have started with our postings and life feels so so so so much better. We are handling everything better, we aren‚Äôt afraid of getting shouted at, we are able to pull all nighters, we‚Äôve learnt to hoard coffee and find hot water and just gulp a spoonful in order to stay awake. When we go in hospitals, and see so much suffering, i couldn‚Äôt have asked to be in a better profession. It breaks my heart to see patients in so much trouble, and the thought to be able to help them one day just makes all these small troubles worth it. 

Ik I‚Äôm way too young to actually write about it, and ik there are wayy too many hardships that i have to face, but like i said, i wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. Yes this is difficult, but just tell me what‚Äôs not in today‚Äôs world? There‚Äôs nothing more noble than this and if you have to choose difficult anyways, then why not this. 

It doesn‚Äôt get easier, you just learn to deal with it. Don‚Äôt leave it just because its difficult. Take it because there is nothing more rewarding (in every way) than this.

1gyunj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/1gyunj3/dysguesia_foul_taste_in_mouth/,Dysguesia- foul taste in mouth,"Dysgeusia - foul taste as MS symptom?

I am recently diagnosed (just a couple weeks ago, first DMT 12/4) and am wondering about unusual symptoms I had years ago. I assume they are rare MS symptoms, but am very curious if others here have experienced.

Off and on, for maybe 1-2 years, I would get phases of an extremely foul taste in my mouth. It was hard to describe other than it just tasted disgusting. It was not a dry mouth or poor hygiene issue. It was faintly there all the time and would greatly intensify with eating or drinking. Made me not want to eat much during those times, as you can imagine. Would last a few days up to two weeks. 

Then, I once had a feeling on one side / tip of my tongue that it had been burned by coffee (I hadn‚Äôt), but the feeling lasted. And the weird part was that there was actually an intense red area where the ‚Äòburnt‚Äô part was. With a clear line of definition from scorching red part to normal part. Doc took a pic for the record but never pursued or followed up. I chocked it all up to strange perimenopause symptoms.

Now that I‚Äôve been diagnosed, my doctor seems to think those weren‚Äôt MS symptoms. But the dysguesia part to me feels like it very likely was. The way it came and went. And no other explanation for it?

I am so so curious if anyone else here has had this symptom. Not a lack of taste, but a constant, very foul or other specific taste sensation. Also the weird red tongue thing - so strange & no explanation for it‚Ä¶",2,1732465117.0,MultipleSclerosis,1,1.0,False

About an hour later, I made breakfast (sausage, biscuits, and eggs), and it seemed like our daughter was not really eating much other than the sausage. To incentivize her to eat all of her food, or at least more, I offered her a popsicle as a reward. I specifically bought these popsicles last night at the grocery store because they are 100% all-natural orange juice with no sugar added, and they‚Äôre packed with vitamin C, which is great for this time of year for her to have in her system.

Orders 2 venti decaf vanilla lattes with 4 Splenda at DT. Has loud truck. Always has a little cigar in his mouth at the window (or lights it). Always tips $1. 4/10.

Orders a venti mocha cookie crumble and a spoon. Sits in the Cafe and eats it. Always cleans up after himself. 9/10 (because the frap is a little annoying)

Places a mobile order for cafe, comes immediately to the DT. Always a laundry list of customizations. Very impatient, and super rude. I can smell her bad breath at the window. 1/10

Mobile Orders through the DT, never orders at the window. Very patient, super sweet, doesn't ask for anything extra, not even straws. 10/10

Always mobile orders the same thing. One day changed up the iced doppio to a hot coffee. Never comes to DT before his order is ready. 9.5/10 (because he left me scrambled with that hot drink that day and we didn't have a sticker so I didn't know it was his)

I don‚Äôt know what could be causing this problem. If anyone has any ideas, I‚Äôd appreciate it. Thank you very much.",1,1732464873.0,DeLonghi,1,1.0,False

I've drinking/making espresso for a while now, but over the last couple of months, I have started enjoying pour overs more . A V60 is my go to brewer for now.

Since I originally started with espresso, I currently own a Eureka Mignon espresso grinder. While it produces okay pour overs sometimes, I feel like it's quite inconsistent. And since it's not really designed with single dosing in mind, using it as such is getting kind of annoying. With all the Black Friday sales going on, I've been looking at getting a hand grinder.

I mainly drink fairly lightly roasted coffees (for example Tim Wendelboe and I've recently tried one from John Schot, which I really enjoyed as well). Often I'm trying to minimize any bitterness or roasty flavours. I also don't mind the coffee being more tea like and having less body.

The main focus for the grinder is obviously supposed to be pour overs, but ideally it'd be able to do espresso every now and again as well. Since I'm not the only person using the Eureka and quickly changing beans is kind of annoying as well.

A lot of the 1ZPresso grinders are on sale on Amazon (Germany) right now: Q (not Q2) for 90‚Ç¨, J for 110‚Ç¨, X-Ultra and X-Pro S for 130‚Ç¨. I've read that the new Q isn't supposed to be as good as the old one and that the X-Pro now uses the same burr as the X-Ultra, which is also supposed to not be as good anymore.

The Kingrinder K6 is also on sale for 90‚Ç¨, but to me it kind of looks cheaper built, than the 1ZPresso stuff.

My main question is, whether it makes sense to buy a cheaper hand grinder or if I should just save up a little more and get something like a Kinu or C40 for around 200‚Ç¨.

I'd love to hear your guys' thoughts on it.  
Sorry for the long post and thank you for any help :)",1,1732464868.0,pourover,26,0.67,False

I just saw this over on Facebook and wanted to share it with someone. It's just another example of why it is so easy to be a fan of / root for the guy. 

Steppin' In It is a roots band that has been a fixture in my Michigan town for decades (and all great dudes themselves from my experience).  They aren't well known nationally. They're not on anyone's 'hot list'. They're everyday working musicians who through their long career have made a living but not much beyond that. 

This morning they shared this picture from an old winter tour and the first person to comment was Billy from his personal account. Despite the whirlwind success he's had William still seems like a genuine decent everyday dude. Just hanging out on a Sunday morning, probably with a cup of coffee and a joint, checkin' in on his old buddies, offering support and encouragement. 

The music business needs more guys like him. ",34,1732464806.0,BillyStrings,6,0.93,False
