1m5qk2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1m5qk2j/my_pots_story_how_functional_neurology_alleviated/,My POTS Story & how functional neurology alleviated my intense flare,"It's been a year since I went to Neurologic Wellness Institute for functional neurology treatment for a flare that simply upended me. I can confidently say it played a significant role in my recovery. While yes, I still have POTS--this is no cure. But, I just finished my first ever 5k, which I never thought I'd be able to do. And I plan to run some more. So, going from bedridden to running a sub 30-min 5k is pretty huge.

**First, a little background**. I'm 28yrs old, non binary, and I've had POTS since the onset of my period at age 14. There's a chance I had it prior to this--I'd had a few fainting spells in grade school, but nothing like the series of syncope episodes from ages 14-15. It would happen in the middle of class, getting out of the shower, I'd even fallen down a few sets of stairs. Needless to say, my noodle had been knocked around quite a bit. Syncope would occur either upon standing after sitting for some time, or even while seated just by raising my arms if I were going for a wee stretch. The closest thing I could relate it to was almost like a mini seizure in the way of how I felt--loss of all control of body movement, the world would fade black and go numb, my hearing would deafen, felt small ticks in my body--but I would come to almost as soon as I'd go down. I don't really know if this is the typical experience of others, but thought I'd mention it.

After my body experienced enough of those episodes, I think it learned during the phase in pre-syncope what was about to happen and I'd get to a wall or sit down as fast as I could before hitting my head once again. Over the years, I noticed I'd go months without pre-syncope, then I'd get a flurry of them. On and off this would go, with only a handful of actual syncope episodes within the last 8 years. 

Then came March 2024. I had a moment of re-traumatization occur that brought me back to trauma I endured as a child. I'm a survivor of reoccurring childhood sexual assault that took place from the ages of 5-8yrs old, and I do believe this had triggered the POTS to eventually manifest. As a condition that is noted as a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, well, how could it not be related? After this moment in March 2024, I was swiftly and \*finally\* diagnosed with PTSD (after many misdiagnoses over the years of bipolar, BPD, depression, etc) which I kinda knew but felt almost validating to receive it from a psychotherapist. So, I focused on the effects of the PTSD episode and hadn't thought at all about how my POTS could be playing a roll. It was constant, unending flash backs. I'd wake up in the morning with intense anxiety and fear, sobbing. I couldn't close my eyes without getting pangs of guilt/shame/sadness/anxiety or seeing flashbacks. 

My nervous system was intensely dysregulated, so naturally this turned from a PTSD episode to a long-term POTS flare quite quick. The morning anxiety worsened as soon as I would sit up out of bed, triggering my heart rate to race uncontrollably. I don't identify as an anxious person, and was confused as to why bouts of anxiety would ravage my body/brain/all my senses multiple times throughout the day. I became extremely light and sound sensitive, to the point where going into a busy restaurant would send me into a full blown panic attack. I began wearing my loop earbuds everywhere I went. I live in Chicago, and I felt trapped by my surroundings, unsafe wherever I went solely based on my sensory sensitivities. I was being forced to move out of the apartment I lived in for 3 years, which was the most stable I'd ever been. My already hypermobile joints started subluxing 8-12 times a day, causing even more panic attacks as my lack of proprioception was thrown off. I couldn't exercise my stress away. Riding my bike for 15min felt like running a marathon. My relationship became strained. I stopped drinking, stopped going out late, stopped socializing. My life was unrecognizable. 

The more months that went on, the worse my POTS flare got. I was taking DHH-B for what I coined my ""body anxiety"". This helped me mentally prepare for mornings (sometimes would take the night before or morning of), was a helpful support for socializing, and helped take the edge off my trauma. I'm not a big pharma girlie ever since I was on mood stabilizers for years unnecessarily, so sought supplemental alternatives with my functional medicine doc. I also have never taken other drugs for POTS so don't have much more to say from that but don't dismiss the massive support they've given others. 

I started seeing a dance-movement therapist that helped with my lack of proprioception and move through my trauma using my body. The tools she taught me were monumental, and I still use those tools to this day. 

It wasn't until I moved into a 3-story walk up in July that my symptoms began to truly worsen. I was taking 2-3 LMNT packets a day (2000-3000mg of sodium) and was still experiencing dizzy spells and heart racing that would leave me fatigued for days. I could hardly walk up the stairs to my apartment without feeling like my heart would leap out of my chest. It wasn't until I stopped biking entirely that I knew this needed more support. Biking was my outlet, the closest I've ever felt to freedom. To be unable to bike the 15 minutes to work was devastating. To be fatigued and bedridden for the rest of the day after climbing the stairs to my apartment was unrealistic. I was desperate, and decided to call Neurologic Wellness Institute. 

I didn't believe what they said. How could these tests cure my flare? What would putting me on a tilt table 5x/week do? But when I called their office and discussed my experience the front desk person said, ""oh honey that does sound like POTS. We do specialize in this, and a lot of people see great improvement. We got a rare opening in just a few weeks, would you like to book that?"" A doctors office that really specializes in this? With a lot of experience in improvement? I felt gaslit my entire life by my experience from doctors of all specialties, and this front desk person validated it so simply. I started to tear up.

**The first day at Neurologic Wellness Institute** was a 4.5hr long appointment with every test under the sun. They're a chiropractor clinic with a specialization in neurology, and before you ask, I didn't get a single classic chiro adjustment. The day started with a QEEG scan of my brain, then we did eye movement testing, balance testing, cognitive tests, about 50-80 individual one-off tests with the doctor (couldn't tell ya what they were my memory is still shit lol), and finally a regular shmegular HR test from sitting to standing. No tilt table involved (they save that for the treatment side of things). 

They gave me my first formal diagnosis of POTS (big shocker), and noted two other things they found. My left eye has what they call convergence excess, as my left eye is constantly flicking inward as my brain believes I'm perpetually spinning. Another thing they found is that the left side of my body has pretty extreme proprioceptive issues. The convergence excess was actually quite emotional to learn, and I began to notice it worsened when my emotional state was heightened. The proprioceptive issues were known to me, but surprisingly validating to hear from a doctor. I felt incredibly cared for the entire day, and was shocked to see that the doctor sat and discussed my symptoms and results with me for over an hour at the end.

They asked me what I'd like to focus on during the intensive treatment. The POTS was #1, as my sensory issues, ""body anxiety"" and fatigue made my life unrecognizable. If I had the same insurance and the money to go back for more treatment, I would address the eye convergence excess, as I believe its a symptom of deeper neurological imbalance. 

Treatment began with visiting the office 5x/week for about an hour and a half, and would continue for 2 1/2 weeks. Time was split between the tech who would have me practice a few cognitive tests, then do a bunch of things that would downregulate my nervous system in preparation for tilt table treatment (compression boots, stomach heat pad + abdominal vibration tool, cold head pack, breath work, etc). Tilt table treatment was done in a dark room due to my light sensitivity (hallelujah) and worked by slowly raising the table up until my heart rate began to increase. The compression boots were kept on, as was the cold head pack if I felt it was necessary. The doctor would lower the table just slightly once the HR increased, then would do a bunch of things to lower my heart rate. I don't know the technical term for all of the tools, but she would give my tongue slight zaps as well as other parts of my face (I believe the vagus nerve was involved? can't remember), have me hum, do isometric bicep holds (we found the R side was most effective for me), etc. Then, once my HR went back down, she would raise the table up again and we'd repeat the cycle. The remaining time was spent doing neurofeedback with the QEEG machine (I opted into this treatment due to PTSD and cognition being a factor I wanted to address, and was an additional charge). 

I was skeptical. Would this really work? Would I really see improvement? I wasn't sure, but I was hopeful. I needed it to work. I wanted my life back. 

By the 2nd week, I went out dancing for the first time in months. I didn't drink but I socialized and danced in a way I never thought would be possible again. I was so happy I could cry. Would this last? 

By the end of the treatment, they went through all the testing once again. My brain scans significantly improved. My eye convergence, cognition and proprioception all improved. My heart rate was no longer in the POTS zone. I was in disbelief. I almost truly could not believe it. I had fallen into victim mentality for so long, identifying with this disability stronger than I ever had during the past few months, that I wasn't sure how to move forward no longer needing the crutches of my loop earbuds and my partner to drive me to every doctors appointment and shift at work. 

A year later, and I feel free. Yeah, my HR still gets into the POTS zone and I still drink a ton of electrolytes, but occasionally I have a coffee. Or a glass of wine. Or run a 5k (?!?!) And I'm definitely back to biking 50-100 miles a week. I feel me again. A different version of me, not quite totally ""healed"", but I feel free. 

I think it was worth it. And I would do it again if I could. I would never wish myself back into that place. I take my training seriously, as I want to maintain this level of fitness. I'm a slow runner, but I'm OK with that. I'm not getting injured as much as I had in the past \*knock on wood\*. My cognition still isn't the best, but I never did follow up neurofeedback (I wish I would), but I'm now getting my masters degree in Acupuncture which I never thought I'd be able to do. The summer heat still takes it out of me, and my trauma is still part of my past, but by god do I feel more me than I ever have. ",1,1753121886.0,POTS,1,1.0,False
1m5qj5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1m5qj5j/we_found_a_single_dead_german_roach/,We found a single dead German roach,"Hi all, I have moderate OCD which includes an intense aversion of bugs, roaches in particular. It is severe enough that I can’t google the topic because I can’t handle the pictures that come up with searches which is why I am here.


I have recently bought and moved into my first house. A few weeks into renovating the place I came across one single very dead German roach in a kitchen drawer. Dead enough to be a disintegrating exoskeleton at this point. Ever since then I get nauseated and sweaty in my kitchen, and it’s affecting my ability to eat in my home.


We had it pest inspected before purchase and it was all clear. My FIL has been in the crawl space recently and says he saw no evidence of pests either. We have been ripping out pieces of broken kitchen cabinet shelving and saw nothing there either. We’ve opened up the oven and microwave’s innards to super-deep clean, ripped up all the kitchen floors, pulled out appliances, and still have seen no pest signs along the way. The only other odd thing we found was a large pile of loose coffee grounds in the bottom of the cabinet below the same drawer. We are 1000% certain they were coffee grounds, we smell tested and put it in water. It looked like the previous homeowners had a coffee ground spill when moving things out and didn’t care to clean it, but I guess it could’ve been food stored by a pest? I have no idea if anything would do that with coffee grounds.


Please tell me I have nothing to worry about, or if I do, how to mitigate it ASAP and what else I can do. The OCD already has me in the habit of storing bread/dry goods in the freezer and we clean up after cooking right away. Even better, if there’s a way to know for certain whether I do or don’t have a problem without paying for a second-opinion pest inspection so soon I’m all ears.",0,1753121827.0,homeowners,0,0.5,False

1m5qhtz,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1m5qhtz/desert_son_part_v/,Desert Son Part V,"Im walking back into the Apple Valley air from the warehouse. I out did myself. Was able to get everything done and out by lunch. Even called the temp agency saying the job wasn’t a right fit for me. Now need to burn that bridge. They were a good cover. 

I get back in my car with the box of cloves and the candle I snatched from the disposition pallet. I just sit there for a moment, letting the silence thicken, trying to gather my thoughts.

I absentmindedly turn the key in the ignition and head toward the 15 freeway. I can’t believe I almost let a few scribbled lines on some boxes drag me back to everything I walked away from. I made it real clear to Thomas, I don’t take jobs that have anything to do with demons.

I flick the blinker on as I merge onto the onramp. I need to calm down. In all fairness, this wasn’t even real witchcraft. If anything, it looked like someone was dabbling in alchemy. Technically not witchcraft, but same ballpark as far as I’m concerned. Either way, I wasn’t paid to solve that. I was paid to get proof, and I got it.

Still, I can’t help but wonder, who’s using alchemy, and why? What’s the endgame?

I take the next exit and pull into a gas station. I grab the clipboard from the passenger seat and flip through the mold reports. Looks like every moldy shipment was signed off by the same guy. Jim Bear.

Says here he used to work in Non Con, the department for items too bulky or fragile for the conveyors.

I bet his name’s in the candle report too.

Just as I’m reaching for the next page, my phone rings. I answer without checking who it is.

“Hello?”

“Jamie! Just checking in. How’s it going?”

It’s Tommy.

How much do I tell him? I don’t want to tip my hand too early, I don’t even know how much he’s keeping from me. I hate thinking it, but I can’t rule it out.

“Is that doubt I hear in your tone, Thomas?” I say, trying to sound like I’m setting up for a punchline. “I got the proof of them ignoring protocol, and I have evidence of what might be causing it.”

“I knew you’d knock it out of the park. The client only wanted one of those, and you got both.” His voice is too smooth, like he’s testing me.

“Where do you want to meet up?” I ask, then follow up quick, “And am I getting paid on delivery, or do I have to wait for a check to clear?”

“I forgot you like things upfront. Usual spot. Coffee’s better this time of night anyway.”

When I take jobs, I have one rule. One I live and die by, trust nobody.

It stings not being able to trust Tommy. But this is a job. Personal feelings stay off the clock.

I pull into the café parking lot. With me are the mold report and the evidence box. I order two coffees and take my regular seat by the back window.

As I sip, my mind drifts, not to my mom, not to high school. This time, I think about my cousin. The one who grew up in my house. One day his mom dropped him off and never picked him up. After that, I called him my brother.

The last clear memory I have of him? I made him breakfast. It was a week after I turned eighteen. Mom had been committed to the state hospital, and we were staying with our grandparents. Once I knew I could go, I told him I had to leave. That Grandma would look after him, and Grandpa would make sure he had what he needed. I was gone before the coffee finished brewing.

I haven’t seen him since. I hoped I might at least run into him at the funeral home during Mom’s viewing. No luck. Maybe he left too.

I sigh and let the memory slip back into the dark.

The bell over the café door rings. I glance up. It’s Tommy. He’s holding an envelope with a noticeable bulge. That’s something, at least.

He walks over, we shake hands, and I motion for him to sit.

“For getting the evidence and the report, you earned a little bonus,” he says, sliding the envelope across the table.

I take it and hand over the box with the report on top.

“Thanks.”

“You’re not gonna count it? At least open it and pretend,” he says, almost whining. “Let me gloat for hooking you up.”

“This is why I don’t do business with friends,” I tell him. “I do the job, I get paid. If I count it in front of you, that’s disrespect. Like I think you’d stiff me.”

“I didn’t mean it like that,” he says, suddenly defensive.

“Then how did you mean it?”

He looks at me hard, like he’s weighing something.

“Look, you’ve been gone a long time. Nobody could get ahold of you. Things changed. The kind of jobs you want, they’re not easy to find anymore.”

“What are you talking about?” I ask, even though I don’t want to know.

“You fucked up big time when you left. That cousin of yours, the one you left at your grandparents, he sold your secrets. And not just to moody teens like you used to when you were one of them. He went to bad places. Talked to worse people. People you knew.”

I see the heat rising behind his eyes.

“Bullshit. He didn’t know anything I was doing.” The words taste bitter as they leave my mouth.

“Then why did he have a lighter!?” Tommy grabs the box and report, then stands. “I’ll call you in the morning.”

Fuck. I’m going to have to show my hand after all.

“Someone is using alchemy at that warehouse.” I just let it sit there.

Tommy sits back down and stares daggers at me. “What do you mean someone is using alchemy?”

Before there was chemistry, there was alchemy. Where witchcraft used herbs and shit for rituals, alchemy used them for their property makeups. Combine stuff and see what happens. Nine times out of ten, alchemists kill themselves breathing in poison they didn’t mean to make.

What makes alchemy as dangerous as witchcraft to me is that if one of those potions goes airborne, a lot of people could get hurt. At least with witchcraft, you're putting your own life on the line.

“I get paid to bring you evidence. I’m not paid to start spewing out theories.” I take a sip of my coffee and breathe deep, in and out. “That’s why I wasn’t going to say anything.”

“Cut the shit. You delivered and got paid. The job is done. We’re no longer speaking like we have a contract. Get me?” He punctuates the point by finally drinking the coffee I got for him when I arrived.

“Some guy named Jim Bear seems to be doing experiments. Either the boxes or the stuff in them has a mold. They get shipped with a demonic candle, and something in the wax accelerates the mold growth. Must happen when the wax heats up, even just a little.”

I can see in his eyes he’s struggling with what I’m saying. “You got all that from just one visit? Before you even clocked out for lunch, no less?”

“I used to be good at what I did, Tommy. I used to be able to step into a city and tell you how many demons influenced the population. What concoction the jackasses used to lure demons to them.” Son of a bitch. I can feel the flicker of pride trying to ignite. I better check myself. “I refuse to do that anymore. I won’t participate in it anymore.”

Tommy is quiet. Not a loss-for-words kind of quiet, but something heavier.

“Then help me expose these bastards. You made everyone think you were untouchable. Then finally, when your secret got out, everyone wanted to try and be ‘A Desert Son.’”

I didn’t even think about that. It was a stupid title I made up. Something to sound cool. Coyote said I needed a name people would remember. I didn’t think anyone would take it so serious.

“That’s dangerous and you know it.” I down the rest of my coffee and set the mug down a little too hard.

“Jaime, they already got your mom.”

**CHAPTER TWO**

DIFFERENT



  *“Legends never die,”* Dad told me once. *“They may perish physically, but they will forever carry on within us, motivating us to keep their legacy alive. We must make their fight worth it.”*

  I sit in the rocking chair across from him, my legs are barely long enough to reach the floor if I lean back.

  “How does a person create a legacy?” I ask him, my voice still infused by youthful innocence.

  “People who have a legacy have paid a price that not many people are willing to pay, no matter the outcome. They have a fire burning within them that is kindled only when the time is right,” he says, his steel-blue eyes locked into mine.

  His words hit me in a different way. One I will never forget.

  \*\*\*\*\*\*

  “Lainey!” I hear Dad’s voice from the hall. “We have to leave here in a few minutes.”

  I jolt in my desk chair, his voice piercing through the silence. I take a sip of coffee—cold.

  *Great. How long have I been sitting here?*

  Forcefully swallowing the coffee, I quickly start lacing my boots up and grabbing a green jacket out of the closet before Dad realizes I’ve been sitting around.

  I tie my hair up in a low ponytail, some pieces draping to the side of my face.

  “I’m ready. Sorry, it took a few more minutes,” I sigh, rushing to the kitchen to refill my thermos with coffee.

  “The truck’s warming up, your lunch is already packed. Oh, and make sure to take a coat just in case the weather acts up,” he says, walking out the door while putting his arms through his coat.

  “Okay, thanks.”

  I step out of the front door. The warm porch light gently illuminates the entrance. Moths frantically fly around the light, casting monstrous shadows on the wall. The sky is a calming gradient of deep blue, purple, and dark pink.

  I let the tips of my boots hang off the porch and take a few deep breaths, watching it float out in front of me in silver clouds, slowly dissipating after a few seconds.

  The taillights of the truck make the exhaust appear red as it floats away from the pipe.

  *Another day, alive and healthy.*

  I step into Dad’s white 2001 Chevrolet Silverado. The dashboard is lit in green and blue lights, and the heater is at full blast.

  The interior lights emphasize the sun-bleached streaks in Dad’s hair. He takes a sip of coffee from his thermos with the “Don’t Tread on Me” flag engraved into the steel. I got it for him last Christmas. I knew it would be a perfect gift. He puts the truck in gear and starts driving.

  As we’re going down the road, he looks over at me, speaking in his charming Texas accent, “So, why were you up at three in the morning scrolling through the news?”

  “Just had a weird dream and thought I’d stay up,” I say, repressing the urge to unload my mind.

  “Honey,” he says softly, glancing into the rearview mirror, “you can tell me anything. You know that, don’t you?”

  *What do I say? We all have secrets, right?*

  “I don’t know, Dad. Everything seems so different lately.”

  “Yeah,” he sighs, clenching his jaw. “I did not see this coming either.”

  I wonder about Mom. Mary Bwen Ledger. Dad has scarcely mentioned her name anymore. I stopped talking about her years ago because, when I do, the grief washes over his face all over again.

  *I have to mention her. I want to keep her alive, not just a memory.*

  My throat tightens. “I—I wonder what Mom would think right now.”

  He grips the steering wheel tighter, biting his lip. He just nods, not saying anything. There is nothing to say. The silence lingers between us, carrying our grief. Something breaks inside of me—for both of us. Barely noticeable tears run down his cheek.

  My world shattered with a single phone call.

  \*\*\*\*\*\*

  The phone rings while I’m completing some homework problems. Dad leans his elbows on the kitchen island, answering emails for work.

  “Can you get that, Lainey?” he says, the blue light from the computer reflecting fragments of the screen into his glasses.

  “Sure,” I say, lowering myself down from the chair.

  “Hello?”

  “This is Knoxville Police Dispatch. Is your father Wes Ledger?” an unfamiliar voice answers.

  My heart pounds harder in my chest. Something’s wrong.

  “Um—he—he is.”

  “May we speak with him?”

  I tap Dad on the shoulder, giving him the phone.

  He clears his throat. “Hello?”

  Voices whisper from the other end, but I can’t make out the words they are saying.

  His hands are shaking as he holds the phone. Then it plummets to the floor and he gets up quickly. “Lainey, we have to go. Your mom has been in a bad car wreck,” his voice rattles with each word.

  *What?*

  \*\*\*\*\*\*

  It happened so fast. Everything. The things that matter most to you are ripped away with no warning.

  I rub my eyes and look back up at the road, taking a sip of coffee. Dad reaches over, squeezing my hand.

  He knows how I feel. It is just too much to put into words.

  Rain starts tapping against the windshield, streaming down my window. I reach for my phone, pulling it out of my jacket, scrolling through my contacts until I stop at “Mom.”

  Phone number: 865-378-0981

  The phone icon at the top right corner of the screen stands out to me. I want to call her, but she will not answer.

  What I would give to talk to her right now. To tell her how much I love her.

  Click. Call.

  I slip it back into my pocket, feeling it vibrate through me. Then hang it up.

  Dad’s eyes flicker over.

  “Lainey,” his voice cracks and he swallows, “I do that too. I do that too.”

  The dotted white lines along the road blur into each other, taillights and headlights reflect into the raindrops, creating colorful streaks on the glass.

  A sign stands amidst the wet parking lot of a closed clinic. It is lit up, reflecting into the wet puddles on the pavement. The large lettering reads, “FREE Novira-26 Vaccination + $20.”

  “Ever since President Kessler announced Operation Warp Speed, they have given this out like candy. And to my knowledge, without proper testing too,” Dad says, looking over to the sign.

  The sign looks a bit *too cheerful*. Maybe the way it is lit up. I don’t know what it is about it, but it sends a chill down my spine.

  “Yeah,” I whisper, looking down from the window. “Nobody at my school has actually gotten really sick, just the common cold and flu.”

  “Makes me wonder,” Dad says, looking in the right mirror of the car back at the sign.

  \*\*\*\*\*\*

  We pull up to Linden High School, where I attend junior year. Kids are running with their hoods over their heads to get out of the rain and freezing wind. He pulls into a parking space and shifts the truck into park.

  He shifts in his seat, looking over at me, his eyes tinged with grief. “Be careful. I can’t lose you, too.”

  “You better stick around too,” I sniffle, trying to lighten the mood.

  They say time heals all wounds, but does it?

  “Love you, Dad,” I step out, pulling my heavy backpack from the floorboard, burdened with books.

  As I’m walking away, I stop, standing in the downpour, looking behind me. The truck sits there in the parking lot for a few seconds before it drives away, catching up with the red and white streaks of traffic blurring by.

  A piece of me goes with it.

  Maybe it’s just the bruise of loss.

  I don’t put my hood on my head. My wet hair sticks to my face, as drops run off of my lashes into the crevices of my lips.

  Everything is a blur around me. I’m not sure if it is the tears in my eyes or the rain. Kids scramble through the parking lot all around me as I stand there.

  The rain feels as if it belongs to me. 

Sometimes you need to be rained on to know how good the sunshine is.

  A burnt orange Kia pulls beside me and the window rolls down, revealing a blonde woman in her 40s. “You okay!?” she yells through the rain. “Do you need a ride!?”

  *I probably look crazy standing out here alone in the rain. I don’t care.*

  “No—no thank you!” I yell back, starting to run towards the doors.

  Walking in school feels like walking into a foreign land—dark, unknown, but somehow familiar. All the weird glances prick me like a thousand needles.

  *There she is. The girl who thinks everything is a Psy-Op.* I can hear it now. I can’t hear their whispers, but I feel their words—their intentions.

  *I’m not insane. I don’t care what they think.*

  “Lainey!” a familiar voice sounds through the chaos.

  She breaks through the crowd, wrapping her warm arms around me. Her hug offers an escape from reality.

  “Hey, Tessa,” I sigh, trying to surface a smile.

  “You are soaked. You okay?” she scans me, her green eyes stopping on mine.

  “Mmm-mm,” I gently nod. “Just had a rough morning.”

  My eyes are a little watery from a spiral of emotions. I carry myself to Algebra II class and sit next to Tessa. She leans forward, resting her head on her forearms, her wavy blonde hair concealing her face.

  Everything the teacher says just comes in as background noise. Zoning out of the world offers time to let my mind breathe.

  “Ms. Ledger? Can you come to the board and solve this word problem?” Mrs. Wize says.

  She carries an odd smirk across her face, like she is trying to prove something.

  “Umm, sure.” The chair screeches against the tile floor as I push it back, making the class break out in muffled giggles.

  I ignore them and approach the whiteboard, barely seeing my reflection in it. I glance toward the class for one second and then back to the word problem.

  My whole body is frozen. Thinking.

  Faint laughter comes from the class. They all lean back in their chairs, confident that I will fail.

  “It takes four seconds for the ball to hit the ground. Once it does, it bounces back up at 25% of its original height, making the second bounce go up by 200 feet,” I say, slowly turning around to the class, staring Mrs. Wize right in the eyes.

  Suddenly everything goes silent, then a boy shoots up with his hand on his desk. “She is cheating!” His voice echoes through the room. Then he starts to laugh a little, “She got a hold of the homework or something. There is just no way—”

  “That I could do this in my head?” I say, stopping him mid-sentence.

  “No,” he pauses. “There isn’t.”

  I walk closer to him, then lean over his desk. His eyes grow in his head the closer I get. “First of all, *Jason,*” I say, just loud enough for everyone to hear. “I have not gotten into the homework, and that is a ridiculous assumption. Second, what are the chances that I would even remember the answer?” My voice gets more intimidating. “Third, why not be proud of *your* classmate instead of thrusting *your* insecurities on someone else?”

  *Jason was never like this. He’s been—off in the last couple of weeks.*

  Nobody has the courage to look me in the eye. I don’t care. I don’t like being looked at anyways.

  I lower myself back into my chair next to Tessa, leaning my head back and taking a deep breath.

  “You did amazing, Lain,” she whispers.

  “Just not dealing with nonsense today, I guess,” I sigh, keeping my eyes closed.

  \*\*\*\*\*\*

  As we’re leaving class, Jason almost trips, then stands there for a second taking a breath.

  “You okay, Jay?” one of his buddies asks, patting him on the back.

  “Fine,” he swallows, pivoting toward the bathroom.

  A tinge of guilt weaves itself into my heart.

  *I should not have been that harsh on him.*

  “I will be right back, Tessa. Need to talk with Jason,” I say, leaving her side.

  I stand by the men’s bathroom, knocking on the door. “Jason!”

  Nothing.

  Knocking like this reminds me of my dream. A shiver runs down my spine, expanding through my body.

  “Jay!”

  I step through the door. “Jason?” My throat tightens with each word.

You're going to see me popping up in your feed a lot this week! This coming weekend I am going boots on ground for my first time with my friend Michele. We are two opposites but that's not a bad thing... We both have skills that are needed to achieve the goal. I have about $1,000 worth of money invested in this trip heading down south from Ohio, it's definitely not a short drive! 

Since I've posted before thinking that nobody is really chosen my search area, I have heard some people come out of the woodwork talking about how when they went there they were surprised at how many other people were gathered there doing the exact same thing... Difference between me and them is I'm not doing the exact same thing. They are going the wrong way... 

They think it's just going to be that easy.. they're going to get to the top and there they will find their joy. But maybe they should have done more research on what exactly Joy is? Besides Joy isn't the destination.. It's the journey. Spending all this time trying to reach the destination you forget to stop and smell the roses... 
If it is on your path, chances are you won't see it until you're on your way back and by that time, your eye will on the car. 

Although, I have a great goal... The trip alone is a godsend. I'm a 40-year-old mom with a toddler and a teenager. This trip is past due lol I can't wait to sit in 360 views watching clouds roll over my campsite like ocean waves 💕 But I think the real prize is seeing the stars because we don't get to see a lot of those up here. I remember 4 years ago randomly driving 12 hours and 21 minutes down to Georgia to go see an old friend anticipating bringing him back with me... 

I remember one night looking up in the sky and seeing what looked to be a big black rectangle in the mist of a million stars almost mirroring the camper.. The rectangle was not the same dark as the rest of the sky around it. I felt like we were being observed and it reminded me of a dream I once had, looking up into a dark rectangle in the sky to see beautiful colored bismuth. 

That's when I knew that this was more than just a little vacay or a little get away... I went inside and grabbed him to show him what I was seeing and it was still there!! It was proof that I was exactly where I was supposed to be in that moment in my life. 

I said get all your shit and get in the car.. brought him back up to Ohio and after 15 long years of thinking I was not capable, We quickly got pregnant and now... we have just the most beautiful baby boy. I named him Duncan because we were both runnin on Dunkin' and I met his dad on National Coffee Day. 

Point is.. that I followed my heart and my intuition when I jumped in that piece of s*** Volkswagen at 3am and wong it... And this coming weekend I'm going to do the exact same thing but only this time I'm going to bring back a treasure box... And if by chance I don't leave with the same treasure I went there for, I will come back more enlightened from my spiritual journey. 

I've been stuck in a house and in a funk for entirely too long. Fresh air is definitely overdue... 
Then after that I'm going to plan another trip even if I do find the box. I can't continue to do nothing.
Yes I have a job, Yes I have a family, And yes I have lots of friends. But when I gave up my business in April, it was to make room for More, to enter. 
I'm not old yet, I still have ambition and dreams... And this is a new chapter in my life!!

So look forward to seeing lots of pictures, new tik toks, and Maybe even YouTube videos? I will probably ghost hunt while I'm there, too.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **HNK Rijeka vs. PFC Ludogorets Razgrad: A Clash of Hungry Titans (With a Side of Rust)**

The UEFA Champions League Qualification stage has arrived, and this Tuesday’s showdown between HNK Rijeka and PFC Ludogorets Razgrad is a match that reads like a Netflix docu-series: *“Two Teams. One Dream. Zero Recent Success.”* Let’s break down the numbers, news, and why this game might end with both managers reaching for the same bottle of antacids.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You’ll Actually Enjoy

The odds tell a story of cautious optimism for Rijeka and a glimmer of hope for Ludogorets. Converting the decimal odds to implied probabilities (because math is the sport of champions):

* **Rijeka**: \~46.5% chance to win (average decimal odds \~2.15).
* **Ludogorets**: \~30.3% chance to win (average decimal odds \~3.3).
* **Draw**: \~31.7% chance (average decimal \~3.15).

The bookmakers are hedging heavily on a draw, which makes sense given Ludogorets’ home dominance (6-1-0 in their last seven home games) and Rijeka’s potential rust. The spread (Rijeka -0.25) suggests they’re slight favorites, but not by much—like a coffee order that’s “extra hot” but not quite on fire.

### Digesting the News: Rust, Glory, and a Touch of Drama

**HNK Rijeka**: Croatia’s kings of the 2024-25 league are coming off a title celebration that might’ve involved more confetti than training sessions. Their domestic season wrapped up in May, leaving them with a summer of… well, not much. Rijeka’s last competitive game was June 1, and their pre-season has been a mix of light friendlies and what appears to be a team-wide participation in a “How Long Can We Nap?” contest.

**PFC Ludogorets**: Bulgaria’s reigning champs are the Energizer Bunny of this tie. They’ve won six of their last seven home games, including a 5-1 thrashing of Beroe that left fans wondering if the opposition had accidentally walked into the wrong stadium. Their coach, Ivan Yurkov, is a tactical wizard wh

1m5qcmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/productbible/comments/1m5qcmp/the_best_handheld_vacuums/,The Best Handheld Vacuums,"Handheld vacuums are ideal for quick cleanups and tight spaces where full-size vacuums fall short. Whether you're dealing with crumbs between couch cushions, dirt in car seats, or pet hair on furniture, a good handheld vacuum offers the speed and flexibility to tackle messes with minimal effort.

After researching dozens of models across a range of performance and design factors, we’ve found that the **Ryobi 18V One+ Performance Hand Vacuum Kit** stands out as the best choice for most people. It combines powerful suction, a convenient battery system, and thoughtful features that make it more effective and easier to use than many competitors.

## 🏆 Best Overall Option: [Ryobi 18V One+ Performance](https://productbible.com/blog/best-handheld-vacuums#ryobi-18v-one)

The Ryobi 18V One+ Performance Hand Vacuum Kit is a standout option in the handheld vacuum category, offering a balance of power, versatility, and thoughtful design. While it may not have the sleekest look, its performance is where it truly shines. Equipped with strong suction and airflow that rivals or exceeds most of its competitors, it handled a variety of messes with ease, from fine debris like baking soda and glitter to bulkier items like cereal and birdseed. Though it has just one power mode, that single setting is comparable in strength to the “boost” modes found on other hand vacuums, without the tradeoff of a severely reduced battery life.

This model comes with two handy attachments: a crevice tool and a 360-degree pivoting brush. These tools are particularly useful for tackling pet hair on upholstery and for reaching tricky areas like car cup holders and tight corners. The brush attachment’s rotating design offers added flexibility, making it easier to clean awkward or hard-to-reach spaces without straining your hand or contorting your wrist.

Battery life is another area where the Ryobi impresses. It delivers a solid 18-minute runtime on a full charge, which is longer than many other models, especially those operating on high suction settings. The included battery also has a charge-level indicator, an uncommon but useful feature for managing power during cleaning tasks. Even better, it recharges in under an hour, compared to the multiple hours required by many competing models.

One of this vacuum’s most practical features is its oversized 2.8-cup dustbin. That’s roughly double the capacity of most handheld vacuums, reducing how often you’ll need to empty it. The bin is simple to open and the filter is washable, helping to keep long-term maintenance costs low and ensuring consistent performance over time.

Built with durability in mind, the Ryobi is constructed from thick plastic that held up well to drops during testing. It’s backed by a generous three-year warranty, and most parts and accessories are replaceable. The vacuum is also compatible with the full range of Ryobi’s 18V One+ batteries and tools, making it a smart investment if you already use other Ryobi products.

For those who already own a Ryobi 18V One+ battery and charger, there is a lower-cost version of this vacuum that omits the kit components. It offers the same performance but comes without attachments. This can be a great value option, though it tends to go out of stock just as frequently as the full kit. Availability in general can be an issue, as Ryobi products are sold exclusively through Home Depot, and both the kit and the tool-only versions have been known to sell out for extended periods.

The Ryobi isn’t without its downsides. Its design, while functional, may be uncomfortable for users with hand or wrist issues due to the battery’s weight distribution. It also doesn’t stand upright on its own, and its bulky form factor and neon-green color may not appeal to everyone. Replacement batteries are expensive, and while third-party options are available, using them voids the warranty. Ordering parts can be confusing, as Ryobi’s website lacks clear navigation for replacement components. Still, despite these quirks, the Ryobi 18V One+ Performance Hand Vacuum Kit remains one of the most effective and practical handheld vacuums available.

## 💸 Best Budget Option: [BLACK+DECKER Dustbuster Blast](https://productbible.com/blog/best-handheld-vacuums#blackdecker-dustbuster)

The BLACK+DECKER Dustbuster Blast Cordless Handheld Vacuum is a great choice if you need a simple, affordable solution for quick cleanups around the house. It’s designed for light-duty tasks like clearing up spilled snacks, dust, and dirt from hard surfaces. For occasional messes on countertops, floors, or window sills, it performs comparably to more expensive handheld vacuums without the added bulk or cost.

In performance, the Dustbuster Blast is a solid cleaner for everyday debris. It can handle basic messes like crumbs and coffee grounds with ease, and while it isn’t optimized for pet hair, its fold-over brush tool is surprisingly helpful on softer surfaces like cushions or car seats. That brush folds over the main crevice nozzle, keeping the tool compact while still offering a way to agitate stuck-on debris.

This vacuum is especially appealing because of how lightweight and user-friendly it is. Weighing just 2.4 pounds, it’s easy to pick up and move around. The weight distribution, with the motor and battery positioned in the center, makes it comfortable to maneuver without feeling front- or back-heavy. Its slim profile also makes it easier to store in tight spaces, and its relatively quiet operation is an added bonus.

Convenience is another strong point. The Dustbuster Blast has a trigger-style power control located underneath the handle, which allows for short bursts of suction only when needed. This design not only conserves battery life but also gives the user better control during spot cleaning. The battery itself holds a respectable charge and can last through several small cleanups before needing to be recharged.

The dustbin is easy to access and clean. It opens with a simple twist, making it straightforward to empty and rinse out as needed. Unlike more complex models that may require multiple steps or disassembly, the Dustbuster keeps maintenance to a minimum.

In terms of tools, it includes everything you need for basic use. The built-in crevice nozzle is ideal for reaching into narrow spaces like couch cushions or car seat gaps. The folding brush adds a little extra agitation for tougher debris, helping to loosen dust and hair that might otherwise stick to smooth surfaces.

There are a few limitations to keep in mind. This vacuum isn’t ideal for deep cleaning upholstery or removing embedded pet hair. Its smaller motor and lower suction can’t match the performance of higher-end models, particularly on fabric surfaces where debris tends to cling. But for everyday crumbs, dust, and surface-level dirt, the Dustbuster Blast remains a practical and budget-friendly pick.

Overall, the BLACK+DECKER Dustbuster Blast Cordless Handheld Vacuum is best suited for users looking for a low-cost, no-fuss option for small messes. While it may not deliver deep-cleaning power, it excels in portability, ease of use, and efficiency for light-duty jobs.

## 💎 Best Upgrade Option: [Dyson Car + Boat](https://productbible.com/blog/best-handheld-vacuums#dyson-car-boat)

The Dyson Car+Boat Handheld Vacuum is a high-powered option that blurs the line between handheld and stick vacuums. It’s essentially the handheld configuration of the Dyson V8 Stick Vacuum, offering exceptional suction and an above-average run time of up to 50 minutes, depending on the power mode selected. Its motorized brush attachment helps lift embedded dirt, making it one of the best performers in terms of raw cleaning ability. The dustbin is also generously sized, comparable to those found on larger vacuums in the category.

Where this vacuum truly excels is in its specialized design for mobile environments. The Car+Boat model comes bundled with a set of thoughtfully selected tools, including a mini motorized brush for removing ground-in debris, an extension hose for hard-to-reach spots, a combination tool for general use, and a crevice tool for precision cleaning. These accessories enhance its utility in cars and boats, allowing it to handle a range of surfaces and awkward angles that many handheld vacuums struggle with.

At 3.77 pounds, the vacuum is relatively lightweight, and its balanced design makes it easier to maneuver than it might appear. The hygienic dirt-ejection system lets users empty the bin without touching debris, and its filtration system helps trap fine dust and allergens, making it a more suitable option for users with mild sensitivities. It’s also powered by Dyson’s digital motor V7, delivering up to 100 Air Watts of suction, which is enough to lift heavier particles like sand and grit from carpets and floor mats.

In terms of runtime, the vacuum offers up to 50 minutes on a full charge, which is better than just about all other options and enough for most car or boat interiors. It doesn’t fade significantly in power during use, which is an improvement over some cheaper cordless models. However, because the unit relies on a non-removable battery, the vacuum must be docked and recharged between sessions rather than swapping in a spare battery, which may limit use for some.

The Car+Boat is best suited for users with very specific needs: those who want the raw suction power of a full-size vacuum in a compact form factor, and who frequently clean tight, enclosed spaces. Pet owners may also appreciate its motorized brush for pulling up hair from fabric and carpeted surfaces. It’s less appropriate for those seeking a lightweight tool for frequent, quick cleanups around the house, where more ergonomically friendly and less expensive models may offer better value.

---

Handheld vacuums have evolved from basic dustbusters into capable, efficient tools for targeted cleaning jobs. Whether it’s crumbs in kitchen corners, pet hair on upholstery, or debris between car seats, a good handheld vacuum can make everyday messes less of a hassle. What sets the best models apart is not just suction power, but thoughtful design, features like washable filters, intuitive dustbins, and versatile attachments all contribute to a more practical, enjoyable cleaning experience.

Ultimately, choosing the right handheld vacuum depends on your specific needs: portability, runtime, ergonomics, or compatibility with existing battery systems. While no model is perfect, the best ones strike a balance between performance and usability. With the right tool, keeping your home, car, or even boat tidy becomes quicker, easier, and less of a chore.",1,1753121425.0,productbible,0,1.0,False

I’ve been semi-following a few travel family influencer couples like aman.shai.xox. They share these polished, oh‑so‑perfect snapshots of family life: smiling kids in the mountains, gorgeous shots in Paris by the Louvre, coffee on a trail, etc etc. 

They position themselves as humble parents just like us: “taking our littles to the mountains,” “nothing beats being able to have a coffee while out on the trails”. But everything looks staged, curated, and free of real parenting chaos.

Meanwhile, they’re traveling business class, staying in luxury hotels all over the world, and posing in their multi million dollar home and fancy outfits. They pretend it’s just busy and tiring like any parent’s life but they clearly don’t sweat the small stuff like cleaning, cooking, paying bills, or budget travel. 

There’s such a disconnect. They say “you can do this too” but don’t mention the fact that most parents will never have their income or access to resources, cleaning help, etc. They gloss over toddler meltdowns in the lobby or spats with a spouse during stressful moments in their posts. Instead, it’s “Sure, it’s tough but it’s worth it,” and the feed is always radiant.

It doesn’t feel real or relatable. I’ve started unfollowing them seeing these staged, over‑positive glimpses just makes me feel worse about my own messy home and my exhausted, unfiltered life with a toddler.

(I am in a relationship now, just wanted to share this story.) To be honest, I do not find him ""that"" attractive. It was the first time I dated someone near my height, he was around 5'4. I met him on a dating app. Since I was desperate to be in a relationship, things went by fast. He moved to the city that I live in, and he applied where I worked and got the job.

We stayed in one apartment. We never made it official. We were just ""dating,"" but since we live together, we fugged once. Then there was a day where I was so tired from work AND college, and he was insisting that we have sex. I was so tired, and I really wanted to sleep instead because 9 hours at work and 4 hrs in school made me so tired. But still, he kept kissing me and touching me. I freaked out and got mad. It was around 11 at night and I packed my stuff and left to go back home. I felt like he was forcing me into sex even if I didnt want to.

Few months later, he messaged me asking how I am. He was trying to flirt through chat. But at that point, I was already disgusted at him. I told him to stop messaging me, but he still kept messaging. So I directly told him I am disgusted about how he looks and that I just forced myself to like him. I told him it was all a mistake and that I wish it never happened.

Then after like 6 months, I suddenly remembered him and wondered if he was still working in the company I worked for. I saw that he passed away 2 years ago. As I'm writing this, I checked his account and sadly his mom is still grieving. He told me how he was abused by his father and older brother that's why he was willing to move to my hometown. But when I pushed him away, he had to go home. And he died from food poisoning, after drinking coffee. His cousin told me how he died. I actually felt sad because... food poisoning? or his father did something? Idk. But I guess I wasnt wrong for not letting myself be SA when I didnt wanna have sex.

It freed me up to focus on actual work—no babysitting required.

I’ve been exploring AI agents lately, but last week was the test: I switched ChatGPT into “agent mode.” Here’s what it handled all on its own:

1. Inbox Cleanup – The agent sorted my unread emails, flagged the important ones, and drafted polite follow-ups.

2. Meeting Prep– It scanned my calendar, read through relevant documents on Drive, and summarized key points.

3. Mini Research Reports– Assigned it to compare three SaaS tools; it generated a bullet-point sheet with pros, cons, and pricing.

The result?

3 hours saved in just two days
Clean, ready‑to‑send follow‑ups
I stayed focused on strategy, not groundwork

It’s like having a virtual assistant that multitasks for you—even opens PDFs, drafts slides, cleans your schedule—while you sip coffee. OpenAI even warns not to trust it blindly for big stuff, but for day-to-day, it's a game-changer.


Curious for opinions:

1. What’s one small weekly chore you’d hand off to an AI agent?
2. Anyone tried “agent mode” yet—what surprised you most?
3. Would you let it schedule your meetings or draft that next email?

P.S. If you want help setting it up, I’ve got a quick-start guide—just DM me!

1m5q4hw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m5q4hw/why_choose_mixpresso_personal_coffee_maker_review/,Why Choose Mixpresso Personal Coffee Maker Review for Single Serve Coffee Lovers?,"The Mixpresso DCM-B-TM Personal Single Serve Coffee Maker has been my go-to companion for my daily coffee fix over the past few weeks. As someone who treasures a fast, reliable, and hassle-free brewing experience in the morning, I found myself intrigued by the compact and lightweight design of this coffee machine. Its accompanying 14oz travel mug seemed like a perfect match for my chaotic mornings when I barely have time to sit and enjoy my coffee at home.

**Compact Design and Portability**  
The size of this thing is an absolute lifesaver. It effortlessly fits on my crowded kitchen counter, competing for space with a toaster and a blender. I’ve also moved it to my office desk once or twice because it’s so portable and doesn’t demand much real estate. It’s made from sturdy materials, and despite its compact frame, it feels remarkably durable. I even took the plunge by tossing it into my car for a weekend trip. Let me tell you, it held up like a champ throughout the ride!  

Check [Mixpresso DCM-B-TM Personal Coffee Maker](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07457z312/) price on Amazon.

**Brewing Experience and Ease of Use**  
This coffee maker is as straightforward as it gets. All you need to do is slide the included travel mug into the base, add your coffee grounds and water, press a single button, and voilà: your coffee starts brewing. The automatic shut-off feature is the icing on the cake. I no longer worry about whether I’ve turned off the machine before rushing out the door. Cleaning is also really simple—pressing the button with no coffee grounds runs water through to rinse the machine. While washing, both the mug and the reusable filter are dishwasher safe, but sometimes I just give them a quick rinse by hand if I’m in a hurry.  

**Highlights**  
- Portable, lightweight design, perfect for small spaces.  
- Includes 14oz travel mug that fits most car cup holders.  
- Single-button operation with automatic shut-off.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
That said, I couldn’t ignore a few quirks while using the machine:  
- It’s incompatible with K-Cup pods; this isn’t a dealbreaker for me since I typically use coffee grounds, but if pod coffee is your thing, it might disappoint.  
- The machine occasionally splashes a bit when brewing, so I’ve learned to place a napkin under the unit to catch the drops.  
- While compact, the build might feel slightly plasticky for some users, which could impact long-term durability.  

**Flavor Quality**  
For a coffee maker of this size and price range, the flavor of the brew exceeded my expectations. Granted, it won’t rival the likes of high-end espresso machines, but it produces a dependable cup of coffee with minimal effort. I experimented with different grinds of coffee grounds and found that medium grounds work best with this machine for a well-balanced cup. The drip method ensures a flavorsome brew—no bitterness, just a smooth and satisfying experience.  

**Competing Products**  
If we’re comparing this device to others like the Keurig K-Mini or the Hamilton Beach Single Serve Coffee Maker, the Mixpresso stands out for its affordability and lighter build. However, Keurig’s machines offer compatibility with K-Cup pods and a wider array of brewing sizes, which might appeal to pod coffee fans. On the other hand, Hamilton Beach offers more flexibility with both pods and grounds but takes up slightly more counter space. The Mixpresso carves its niche with a focus on portability and simplicity, making it an excellent travel-friendly option.

**True Value**  
I’d call this machine a smart purchase for anyone seeking a quick and simplified brewing solution, especially if you appreciate a portable coffee maker that doubles as a travel mug companion. It won’t break the bank and delivers decent coffee without fuss. That being said, its minimal features are accompanied by a few small sacrifices; K-Cup compatibility and splash control might deter some users.

1m5q4ga,https://www.reddit.com/r/SiniStories/comments/1m5q4ga/my_hernia_surgery_recovery_isnt_going_as_planned/,My Hernia Surgery Recovery Isn’t Going As Planned,"I had a minor surgery last Thursday. Hernia repair. Nothing invasive, just laparoscopic. In and out.
St. Emory Medical wasn’t much to look at… stained tile, buzzing fluorescents, that waiting room stink of sweat and lemon-scented bleach… but the nurses were polite. The anesthesiologist cracked a joke about counting backwards from ten.
I remember the mask. The lights above me. The IV burning cold in my arm.

And then…



I woke up in the operating room.

Not the same one. Or maybe just… not the same anymore.

The lights overhead were red and pulsing, dimmer than they should’ve been. The lens covers were clouded and rust-ringed. The walls were lined with trays of used gauze and metal tools soaking in nothing.

The smell was what hit me hardest. Not infection… preservation. Something pickled and raw. Like blood that had been boiled and sealed.

My wrists were strapped down. Not with Velcro. With leather. Old, cracked, soaked-through.

There was movement beside me. A nurse. That’s what my brain told me first.

Short skirt, white uniform stained at the hem. Her stockings were stretched tight over pale thighs, clinging with friction like they’d been pulled on over damp skin. Her mask pressed hard against her mouth, but you could see the shape beneath… lips parted like she was always mid-breath.

Her hips swayed with each step, but nothing about her was inviting. Her body moved like a threat pretending to be a promise. Like someone imitating seduction from memory.

She leaned in close, her breath hot through the mask, brushing my ear like a secret.

Gloved fingers traced my collarbone, then slid down my chest… slow, deliberate, like she was reading me in braille.

She paused below my waist.

Not in hesitation.

In interest.

Her hand slipped under the gown.

The latex was cold at first, but it warmed as she moved… drawing soft circles, lower and lower.

Like she was studying me.

Claiming me.

All the while, she hummed a lullaby I didn’t know…

But somehow recognized.

Another nurse entered behind her… same uniform, darker stains. She moved like she wanted to be watched. Carried a surgical tray with both hands like it was a gift.

The tools weren’t clean. Not even close.

The scalpel had dried tissue curled around the tip. The clamp was rusted at the hinge, with a strip of tendon stretched across the mouth like jerky. One retractor had a wad of black hair snarled in the teeth. Gauze stuck to the tray beneath it all… stiff with blood, cracked at the folds.

The second nurse raised the tray and tilted her head, like she was showing me her favorite toy.

“You’re prepped,” she said.

“You’ll open so clean,” the first nurse whispered, as she traced a finger across my stomach.

Then I closed my eyes. Just for a second.



When I opened them again, the room was empty.

The restraints were undone. Still indented into my skin. No lights. No nurses.

But I wasn’t alone.

I sat up. My gown clung to my back with something warm and sticky. The air was colder than it should’ve been.

I stood.

The hallway outside looked like the same hospital… but peeled open. Linoleum curled off the floor like dried skin. The fluorescent lights buzzed in pulses like a heartbeat. The walls were yellow tile, but rotting, damp, slick.

Room 4 had a patient.

The floor was stained in perfect loops, like someone had bled in spirals. There was an IV bag still hanging, half-full of something black. The line dangled and twitched. A limbless torso lay on the bed, breathing through a rusted trach tube, its eyes fixed on me.

Room 6 was worse.

A woman sat upright in a padded chair. Her face twitched with every stitch. Her jaw was visibly broken… or just never set right. Her eyes wide and unblinking. She was sewing patterns into her own lap using long threads of human tendon. Her hospital gown was hiked around her waist so she could work. I couldn’t see all the designs… just that they were deep. Intentional. And still wet.

She smiled when she saw me.

Her teeth didn’t match.

Room 9 was the worst.

A man, maybe. Braced backward over an exam table, limbs locked in metal restraints. His body was twisted in impossible angles by some cruel brace mechanism, every joint forced in the wrong direction. His mouth hung open, but no sound came out.

A nurse stood behind the glass. One hand resting on her hip, the other slowly rubbing her inner thigh through the fabric. When she noticed me watching, she didn’t stop.

She shifted her stance like she wanted to be seen…

…and when she did, her skirt lifted… just enough to reveal it.

My name, carved into the pale skin of her upper thigh.

Letter by letter.

She traced over them with a gloved finger, never breaking eye contact.



I moved past a nurse’s station. One monitor was still on—showing a room I recognized.

My bedroom.

Me, sleeping.

Then static.



I blinked again and I was in recovery.

White lights. Warm blanket. Apple juice in a plastic cup.

“You scared us,” the nurse said. Her voice was sweet. Too sweet. “You were out a little longer than expected.”

I asked her how long. She just smiled.

Eventually, they said I was free to go. Discharged. A cab dropped me off outside my building like nothing happened. Like it was just a normal procedure.

But things felt wrong immediately.

The apartment looked normal. Same couch. Same coffee stain on the carpet.

But the scar was too long. Curved. Raised in a way that didn’t match the procedure.

The hallway outside my unit smelled like antiseptic and something sweet underneath. Not rot… sterilized rot. The fridge buzzed in a rhythm that was oddly familiar.

Later that night, I woke up to the sound of heels on tile pacing just outside my bedroom.

I got up to check the hallway… walked past the bathroom—and noticed the mirror was fogged.

I hadn’t taken a shower.

I decided to look up St. Emory Medical because I needed answers.

The website was gone.

I found an archived article—local paper. Said the hospital shut down two years ago. Unexplained deaths. Patient files vanished.

An anonymous source claimed some staff were doing things that didn’t follow medical procedures… extra incisions, strange scarring patterns, markings that didn’t show up on any charts.

My surgeon’s name was listed. Dr. Leyra. No trial. No charges. Just “location unknown.”

It’s been days. The apartment’s changing.

The tile behind the fridge has yellowed and cracked. The hallway smells stronger now… like bleach trying to cover something deeper.

The lights hum in a way I’ve only ever heard in one place.

And the door…

I haven’t opened it. Not since that night.

But I hear movement on the other side. Gurneys rolling. Heels on tile. Steel trays clattering like teeth.

I’m posting this now, while I still can. While the modem blinks and the laptop stays cool.

If you’re reading this… check your scar.

If it’s curved.

If it hums.

If you wake up and the walls are wet…

You’re already in it.

I absolutely hate what I have done to myself. I badly want to quit, not just for health reasons but I want my freedom back. I can’t even read 10 pages of a book or watch a movie without the vape it’s embarrassing 🤯 I have been planning to quit for a while now but always find some sad and stupid reason to keep going. Nicotine is not a joke and it is a powerful drug. My anxiety is through the roof and every time I hit the vape it just makes it worse and worse. I have also noticed that the vaping makes me very hungry all the time, I would eat and then an hour later I get hunger pangs and sugar cravings. It has destroyed my energy and I have no desire to do anything apart from laying on the couch. 

Well I said no more! I was big into cycling before and I bought a bike and went on a few rides. Holy crap I am out of shape. I want my freedom back, I want my energy and focus back to put towards things that matter.

1m5q28t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBalkans/comments/1m5q28t/still_thinking_about_the_balkan_guy_worth/,Still thinking about the balkan guy - worth reaching out?,"I don’t even know what I want to achieve with this post, but I just need to let it out. 

I (30 yo woman, Baltic) met a balkan guy (35 yo, Montenegrin) in spring while on a short getaway to another country he’s been working in. I fell something for him I’ve never felt for anyone before (despite being in longterm relationships for most of my adult life) and promised to come back. Bought the tickets in two months. We kept talking, with some conversations being quite steamy. I was supposed to stay at his place, and he promised he would spend time with me. However, as my flight date approached with only couple weeks being left, he started getting colder, until he said I won’t be able to stay with him. He still wanted me close to his place, but my ego was bigger and I booked a few days of my total stay on the the different side of the country. There was a lot of confusion from him, as I felt that he wanted me, but at the same time acted cold in some way. However, after we arrived, we still met a few times, had sex, went for coffee, talked about our lives and plans. And then he left to his country for summer while I was still in the country. 
I told him my real feelings on his way to the airport, as I only had courage to do so when I knew I’d probably never see him again. It quickly escalated in a negative way, as he said things that I took too emotionally. He expressed his wish to still stay in touch, but I quickly deleted all my messages to him and we never spoke again. 
Two months have passed since that day. I’ve been trying to talk to other guys, trying to forget him and go back to my usual life - I’m quite intelligent, some may say, even successful, quite decent looking and can easily get attention from the others, but I cannot even force myself to go on any dates, even with the guys who seem to be even better/more successful/better looking than this one, because I still cannot take this guy out of my head. My heart belongs to him, whether I want it, or not. You cannot imagine how many times I I’ve played our conversations and situations in my head, wishing I could have done things differently.

There are better days when I feel like moving on, but there are also days like this when I’m dying to text him. Especially now, when I know I’m gonna be back to that country in a few months. Hard not to have a hope in my heart to see him again. 

So I don’t know, maybe I’m just looking for an advice from balkan people - should I text him, or should I stop romanticizing a man who probably doesn’t want anything to do with me… 
Maybe it would feel more real if people from the same place as him would shake me up. Or maybe, some of you will be able to understand my sense of longing for him :))

Anyway, thank you for those who read it and for those who choose to be kind. 💕",2,1753120793.0,AskBalkans,1,0.75,False

I’m 6 weeks off the pill and had my first own period some weeks ago and today is my cycle day 20. Everything is quite okay, I’ve experienced a lot of nausea and headache, some mood swings, dropped some weight and discovered that I have a libido (😅). But oh my, my digestion feels so off. While I had my first own period I did clearly had the period poop. But now, on day 20, I have kind of the same, although my food habits hasn’t changed. I do have some few signs that I might be ovulating these days, but is there something called ovulation poop? 🥲 I feel like I won’t even grab a coffee on the run, because my stomach is weird and I have the feeling that I might need a restroom in seconds.

1m5q134,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m5q134/my_hernia_surgery_recovery_isnt_going_as_planned/,My Hernia Surgery Recovery Isn’t Going As Planned,"I had a minor surgery last Thursday. Hernia repair. Nothing invasive, just laparoscopic. In and out. St. Emory Medical wasn’t much to look at… stained tile, buzzing fluorescents, that waiting room stink of sweat and lemon-scented bleach… but the nurses were polite. The anesthesiologist cracked a joke about counting backwards from ten. I remember the mask. The lights above me. The IV burning cold in my arm.

And then…

I woke up in the operating room.

Not the same one. Or maybe just… not the same anymore.

The lights overhead were red and pulsing, dimmer than they should’ve been. The lens covers were clouded and rust-ringed. The walls were lined with trays of used gauze and metal tools soaking in nothing.

The smell was what hit me hardest. Not infection… preservation. Something pickled and raw. Like blood that had been boiled and sealed.

My wrists were strapped down. Not with Velcro. With leather. Old, cracked, soaked-through.

There was movement beside me. A nurse. That’s what my brain told me first.

Short skirt, white uniform stained at the hem. Her stockings were stretched tight over pale thighs, clinging with friction like they’d been pulled on over damp skin. Her mask pressed hard against her mouth, but you could see the shape beneath… lips parted like she was always mid-breath.

Her hips swayed with each step, but nothing about her was inviting. Her body moved like a threat pretending to be a promise. Like someone imitating seduction from memory.

She leaned in close, her breath hot through the mask, brushing my ear like a secret.

Gloved fingers traced my collarbone, then slid down my chest… slow, deliberate, like she was reading me in braille.

She paused below my waist.

Not in hesitation.

In interest.

Her hand slipped under the gown.

The latex was cold at first, but it warmed as she moved… drawing soft circles, lower and lower.

Like she was studying me.

Claiming me.

All the while, she hummed a lullaby I didn’t know…

But somehow recognized.

Another nurse entered behind her… same uniform, darker stains. She moved like she wanted to be watched. Carried a surgical tray with both hands like it was a gift.

The tools weren’t clean. Not even close.

The scalpel had dried tissue curled around the tip. The clamp was rusted at the hinge, with a strip of tendon stretched across the mouth like jerky. One retractor had a wad of black hair snarled in the teeth. Gauze stuck to the tray beneath it all… stiff with blood, cracked at the folds.

The second nurse raised the tray and tilted her head, like she was showing me her favorite toy.

“You’re prepped,” she said.

“You’ll open so clean,” the first nurse whispered, as she traced a finger across my stomach.

Then I closed my eyes. Just for a second.
 

When I opened them again, the room was empty.

The restraints were undone. Still indented into my skin. No lights. No nurses.

But I wasn’t alone.

I sat up. My gown clung to my back with something warm and sticky. The air was colder than it should’ve been.

I stood.

The hallway outside looked like the same hospital… but peeled open. Linoleum curled off the floor like dried skin. The fluorescent lights buzzed in pulses like a heartbeat. The walls were yellow tile, but rotting, damp, slick.

Room 4 had a patient.

The floor was stained in perfect loops, like someone had bled in spirals. There was an IV bag still hanging, half-full of something black. The line dangled and twitched. A limbless torso lay on the bed, breathing through a rusted trach tube, its eyes fixed on me.

Room 6 was worse.

A woman sat upright in a padded chair. Her face twitched with every stitch. Her jaw was visibly broken… or just never set right. Her eyes wide and unblinking. She was sewing patterns into her own lap using long threads of human tendon. Her hospital gown was hiked around her waist so she could work. I couldn’t see all the designs… just that they were deep. Intentional. And still wet.

She smiled when she saw me.

Her teeth didn’t match.

Room 9 was the worst.

A man, maybe. Braced backward over an exam table, limbs locked in metal restraints. His body was twisted in impossible angles by some cruel brace mechanism, every joint forced in the wrong direction. His mouth hung open, but no sound came out.

A nurse stood behind the glass. One hand resting on her hip, the other slowly rubbing her inner thigh through the fabric. When she noticed me watching, she didn’t stop.

She shifted her stance like she wanted to be seen…

…and when she did, her skirt lifted… just enough to reveal it.

My name, carved into the pale skin of her upper thigh.

Letter by letter.

She traced over them with a gloved finger, never breaking eye contact.




I moved past a nurse’s station. One monitor was still on—showing a room I recognized.

My bedroom.

Me, sleeping.

Then static.




I blinked again and I was in recovery.

White lights. Warm blanket. Apple juice in a plastic cup.

“You scared us,” the nurse said. Her voice was sweet. Too sweet. “You were out a little longer than expected.”

I asked her how long. She just smiled.

Eventually, they said I was free to go. Discharged. A cab dropped me off outside my building like nothing happened. Like it was just a normal procedure.

But things felt wrong immediately.

The apartment looked normal. Same couch. Same coffee stain on the carpet.

But the scar was too long. Curved. Raised in a way that didn’t match the procedure.

The hallway outside my unit smelled like antiseptic and something sweet underneath. Not rot… sterilized rot. The fridge buzzed in a rhythm that was oddly familiar.

Later that night, I woke up to the sound of heels on tile pacing just outside my bedroom.

I got up to check the hallway… walked past the bathroom—and noticed the mirror was fogged.

I hadn’t taken a shower.

I decided to look up St. Emory Medical because I needed answers.

The website was gone.

I found an archived article—local paper. Said the hospital shut down two years ago. Unexplained deaths. Patient files vanished.

An anonymous source claimed some staff were doing things that didn’t follow medical procedures… extra incisions, strange scarring patterns, markings that didn’t show up on any charts.

My surgeon’s name was listed. Dr. Leyra. No trial. No charges. Just “location unknown.”

It’s been days. The apartment’s changing.

The tile behind the fridge has yellowed and cracked. The hallway smells stronger now… like bleach trying to cover something deeper.

The lights hum in a way I’ve only ever heard in one place.

And the door…

I haven’t opened it. Not since that night.

But I hear movement on the other side. Gurneys rolling. Heels on tile. Steel trays clattering like teeth.

I’m posting this now, while I still can. While the modem blinks and the laptop stays cool.

If you’re reading this… check your scar.

If it’s curved.

If it hums.

If you wake up and the walls are wet…

You’re already in it.

I am hoping to salvage the concrete tops and not have to buy new ones. I do not know what they were treated/sealed with in the past but they feel like bare concrete to the touch, and like the sealer has worn off over time.

I have some questions:

1. Can they be sanded or polished down to remove the stains, and be resealed? If I sand them down what should I use? What should I reseal them with? Will sanding them down reveal a porous surface that isn’t finish quality?
2. If they can’t be sanded to remove the stains, can I treat them with an epoxy or stain to cover up the stains?

And I kept my chocolate hidden like any normal person who had younger siblings, yes I ate a few and saved the rest for later and even gave my mom one. The next day while my mom was drinking coffee she asked for one Toblerone and I gave her normal, but at the first I joked about eating them all (which me and my mom do ALL THE TIME and she knows I’m joking) I ended up giving her some and I took one for myself, my younger sister saw MY MOTHER eating it and she kept telling me to give my younger sister some and I said no. Because I bought my younger sister her OWN chocolate bar, my sister didn’t even see ME eating the chocolate she only saw my mother. My mom kept telling me to give my younger sister no, i’m a little selfish I know but MY SISTER ALWAYS TAKE EVERYTHING I HAVE FROM ME!!! WHENEVER I ORDER I GET HER SOME TOO!!!

My mom kept pushing me to give her and she something among the lines “but whatever you want with you want with your money but don’t eat it infront of them” (my younger siblings) my sister didn’t even know I was EATING she only noticed MY MOM NOT ME!!!! My mom said also “don’t make me give mine to her” I didn’t say anything but in my head I was like I don’t care give it to her your the one offering. She gave my younger sister a triangle and OFFERED my younger brother who doesn’t even know what’s going and she said no because he literally saw my crash tf out (not like screaming no I’m not that disrespectful to my mom) and HE my younger brother in like 5th grade said no because he obviously saw me refuse to give anyone and said “because it’s hers” referring to me. After that my mom got mad at me and made me cry out of anger because I always cry whenever I’m angry and have been giving me the silent treatment ever since yesterday and it’s making me feel guilty, I feel like a ghost in the house she asked my older brother to do the things that she usually asks me to do like get the remote or put her lunch to pour her coffee which I noticed and actually made me guilty and I just cried and I think I will cry myself to sleep too. I don’t know if I’m in the wrong here and I did throw a fit over chocolate, yes. Please help me and I really hope you understand the situation from my perspective. ",0,1753120615.0,AITAH,1,0.5,False

Another nurse entered behind her… same uniform, darker stains. She moved like she wanted to be watched. Carried a surgical tray with both hands like it was a gift.

The tools weren’t clean. Not even close.

The scalpel had dried tissue curled around the tip. The clamp was rusted at the hinge, with a strip of tendon stretched across the mouth like jerky. One retractor had a wad of black hair snarled in the teeth. Gauze stuck to the tray beneath it all… stiff with blood, cracked at the folds.

The second nurse raised the tray and tilted her head, like she was showing me her favorite toy.

“You’re prepped,” she said.

“You’ll open so clean,” the first nurse whispered, as she traced a finger across my stomach.

Then I closed my eyes. Just for a second.



When I opened them again, the room was empty.

The restraints were undone. Still indented into my skin. No lights. No nurses.

But I wasn’t alone.

I sat up. My gown clung to my back with something warm and sticky. The air was colder than it should’ve been.

I stood.

The hallway outside looked like the same hospital… but peeled open. Linoleum curled off the floor like dried skin. The fluorescent lights buzzed in pulses like a heartbeat. The walls were yellow tile, but rotting, damp, slick.

Room 4 had a patient.

The floor was stained in perfect loops, like someone had bled in spirals. There was an IV bag still hanging, half-full of something black. The line dangled and twitched. A limbless torso lay on the bed, breathing through a rusted trach tube, its eyes fixed on me.

Room 6 was worse.

A woman sat upright in a padded chair. Her face twitched with every stitch. Her jaw was visibly broken… or just never set right. Her eyes wide and unblinking. She was sewing patterns into her own lap using long threads of human tendon. Her hospital gown was hiked around her waist so she could work. I couldn’t see all the designs… just that they were deep. Intentional. And still wet.

She smiled when she saw me.

Her teeth didn’t match.

Room 9 was the worst.

A man, maybe. Braced backward over an exam table, limbs locked in metal restraints. His body was twisted in impossible angles by some cruel brace mechanism, every joint forced in the wrong direction. His mouth hung open, but no sound came out.

A nurse stood behind the glass. One hand resting on her hip, the other slowly rubbing her inner thigh through the fabric. When she noticed me watching, she didn’t stop.

She shifted her stance like she wanted to be seen…

…and when she did, her skirt lifted… just enough to reveal it.

My name, carved into the pale skin of her upper thigh.

Letter by letter.

She traced over them with a gloved finger, never breaking eye contact.



I moved past a nurse’s station. One monitor was still on—showing a room I recognized.

My bedroom.

Me, sleeping.

Then static.



I blinked again and I was in recovery.

White lights. Warm blanket. Apple juice in a plastic cup.

“You scared us,” the nurse said. Her voice was sweet. Too sweet. “You were out a little longer than expected.”

I asked her how long. She just smiled.

Eventually, they said I was free to go. Discharged. A cab dropped me off outside my building like nothing happened. Like it was just a normal procedure.

But things felt wrong immediately.

The apartment looked normal. Same couch. Same coffee stain on the carpet.

But the scar was too long. Curved. Raised in a way that didn’t match the procedure.

The hallway outside my unit smelled like antiseptic and something sweet underneath. Not rot… sterilized rot. The fridge buzzed in a rhythm that was oddly familiar.

Later that night, I woke up to the sound of heels on tile pacing just outside my bedroom.

I got up to check the hallway… walked past the bathroom—and noticed the mirror was fogged.

I hadn’t taken a shower.

I decided to look up St. Emory Medical because I needed answers.

The website was gone.

I found an archived article—local paper. Said the hospital shut down two years ago. Unexplained deaths. Patient files vanished.

An anonymous source claimed some staff were doing things that didn’t follow medical procedures… extra incisions, strange scarring patterns, markings that didn’t show up on any charts.

My surgeon’s name was listed. Dr. Leyra. No trial. No charges. Just “location unknown.”

It’s been days. The apartment’s changing.

The tile behind the fridge has yellowed and cracked. The hallway smells stronger now… like bleach trying to cover something deeper.

The lights hum in a way I’ve only ever heard in one place.

And the door…

I haven’t opened it. Not since that night.

But I hear movement on the other side. Gurneys rolling. Heels on tile. Steel trays clattering like teeth.

I’m posting this now, while I still can. While the modem blinks and the laptop stays cool.

If you’re reading this… check your scar.

If it’s curved.

If it hums.

If you wake up and the walls are wet…

You’re already in it.

1m5pwxb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m5pwxb,👜 [Review] Kelly 25 Sellier in Bleu Saphir Epsom with Palladium Hardware from the brand new Pandabag high-tier factory ✨,"Alright fam… grab a coffee (or a champagne flute 🥂) because we need to talk about *her*. This is the Kelly 25 Sellier in Bleu Saphir Epsom with Palladium hardware, and she’s from the **brand new, high-tier Pandabag factory**—yes, a new factory for my high-tier Hermes obsessed sisters in arms!

And let me just say it upfront while the name may be adorable 🐼: Pandabag did ***not*** come to play. They came to set a new standard.

# 💙 Meet Bleu Saphir: The Sophisticated It Girl

This shade? Breathtaking. Bleu Saphir is that girl you spot across the room at a soirée—the one whose elegance makes you straighten your posture without realizing. It’s a rich, velvety blue with incredible depth. Under sunlight, she sparkles like a sapphire gemstone, while in dim lighting, she shifts to a moody, almost inky midnight. She’s classy, but never cold. Luxurious, but not loud.

# ✨ Sellier Structure: Crisp, Sharp, Perfect

As a Sellier, she’s **tailored to perfection**. The edges are razor sharp—so precise you could balance a Cartier ring on them. Her boxy, structured shape holds beautifully thanks to the Epsom leather, which has just enough texture for scratch resistance while still keeping things lightweight. This isn’t a slouchy “throw me anywhere” bag. She’s a power piece, and she knows it.

# 🔥 Hardware & Details: Luxe Down to the Last Screw

This is where Pandabag flexes its high-tier status:

\- The Palladium hardware? Flawless. Mirror-bright, zero dullness, and the weight feels **exactly right**. Every turn lock click is that satisfying Hermès-level **snick**.

\- The stitching? Tight, even, and perfectly aligned with no skipped or loose threads. The angled corners are smooth and reinforced—no puckering or pulling.

\- The sangles and clochette are slim, elegant, and cleanly cut. Even the glazing is smooth and consistent—no uneven edges or bleeding color.

# 📦 Packaging: She Arrived Like Royalty

Let’s talk unboxing. The dust bag is thick and soft; the hardware came fully protected with flawless plastic (no residue!), and even the tissue paper felt luxurious. It’s clear Pandabag understands presentation matters just as much as construction. This was not a “toss it in a box” situation.

# 💭 Final Thoughts: The Bar Has Been Raised

Bleu Saphir isn’t just a bag. She’s an **event**. Every detail—from the crisp Sellier silhouette to the impeccable hardware—exudes high-tier craftsmanship. This is the kind of piece that stops people mid-sentence when you walk into a room.

***And if this Kelly is any indication of what Pandabag is capable of… the rest of the factory world needs to watch their backs.***

# 🎉 Dream Bags Incoming!

We’re beyond excited to launch Pandabag’s high-tier lineup  to our community. ✨ These are not entry-tier bags. These are high-tier, obsession-worthy pieces made for collectors who want it all: perfect materials, hardware that sings, and finishes that rival **you know who.**

Your body works hard to keep everything running smoothly—but sometimes it needs a little help to reset. That’s what got me interested in **yerba mate**.

Instead of going down the rabbit hole of crash detoxes or sugary cleansing drinks, I wanted something natural. I started drinking yerba mate regularly, and it honestly changed how I feel: more energized, less bloated, and just more balanced overall.

Turns out, yerba mate is packed with **saponins**—plant compounds known to support digestion, liver function, and inflammation. It’s also naturally energizing, but without the crash I usually get from coffee or energy drinks.

Here’s what yerba mate can support:

* ✅ **Flushes toxins** through hydration and kidney function
* ✅ **Supports your liver** with antioxidants
* ✅ **Aids digestion** and helps your body absorb nutrients better
* ✅ **Reduces inflammation** (a big one for me)
* ✅ **Boosts your immune system** over time

I put together a post that breaks down the science and tradition behind it, especially how it’s used in Paraguay, where people drink it cold (tereré) with herbs. If you’re curious:

👉 [Yerba Mate Cleanse](https://drinkteko.com/blogs/yerba-mate-%F0%9F%8C%BF-health-wellness/yerba-mate-cleanse)

1m5ptgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheArchivistsLedger/comments/1m5ptgr/i_run_a_support_group_for_problems_that_dont/,I run a support group for problems that don't exist - Log 041 ‑ 07?/?1/?0?5,"You know those community center bulletin boards with the tear-off phone number tabs? The ones advertising guitar lessons and dog walking services that nobody ever calls? 

**That's how this whole thing started.**

I was twenty-eight, unemployed for the third time in two years, and living in my mom's basement while she ""*gave me space to figure things out.*"" The unemployment office required proof I was actively seeking work, so I'd print out dozens of job applications every week and fill them out at the Riverside Community Center. Free WiFi, free coffee, and nobody bothered you as long as you looked busy.

One Tuesday, while waiting for my laptop to boot up, I noticed someone had torn off every single tab from a flyer advertising ""*Addiction Recovery Support Group - All Welcome.*"" Every tab except one, hanging by a thread.

I don't know why I took it. Maybe I was curious about what addiction felt like, having something you wanted so badly it controlled your life. The closest I'd come was checking my phone every thirty seconds, but that hardly seemed worth a support group.

The flyer said Tuesdays at 7 PM, Room 3B. I was there anyway, so why not?

Room 3B turned out to be a storage closet filled with folding chairs and cleaning supplies. No support group. No people. Just me, standing in a janitor's closet holding a piece of paper.

""Excuse me?"" A woman appeared behind me, mid-forties, worried expression. ""Are you here for the meeting?""

I held up the flyer. ""I think there's been a mistake.""

""Oh."" She looked disappointed. ""I saw the flyer too. I thought... well, I hoped maybe...""
We stood there awkwardly. She seemed nice enough, though a quick glance at a lopsided dress and mismatching socks urged me on.

""What were you hoping to get help with?"" I asked.

She laughed, but not like anything was funny. ""*You'll think I'm crazy.*""

""Try me.""

""*I'm addicted to buying umbrellas,*"" she said. ""*Not using them. Buying them. I have over three hundred umbrellas in my apartment. I can't stop.*""

I waited for the punchline. When it didn't come, I said, ""*That's... specific.*""

""*I know it sounds ridiculous. That's why I need help. My husband left me last month. He said I chose umbrellas over him.*"" Her eyes filled with tears. ""*Maybe he was right.*""

Here's the thing about unemployed twenty-eight-year-olds living in their mom's basement, you don't get many opportunities to be useful. To be needed. This woman was asking for help, and for the first time in months, I felt like maybe I could provide it.

""Well,"" I said, ""I'm not qualified to run a support group, but I've got time. Want to talk about it?""

We spent two hours in that storage closet. Her name was Margaret. She'd bought her first umbrella during a rainstorm twelve years ago, and somehow it had spiraled from there. She described the rush of finding a new umbrella style, the guilt afterward, the promises to stop that she couldn't keep.

*It sounded exactly like addiction to me.*

""Same time next week?"" I asked as we packed up the chairs.

She nodded eagerly. ""*Should we make flyers?*""

I wasn't sure why I said yes. Maybe because Margaret looked hopeful for the first time all evening. Maybe because I had literally nothing else to do with my Tuesday nights.

We made flyers.

""**Support Group for Unique Dependencies - All Welcome, No Judgment - Tuesdays 7 PM, Room 3B**""

I figured we'd get a few people with shopping problems or maybe some internet addicts. Normal stuff.

The next Tuesday, Margaret brought a man named David who was ""*addicted to buying left shoes.*"" Only left shoes. He had over a thousand of them, all different styles, all utterly useless without their partners.

The week after that, a woman named Susan joined us. She was addicted to apologizing. Not just saying sorry too much; she literally could not stop apologizing for things that had nothing to do with her. Strangers' bad days, weather, traffic, her presence in rooms.

""*I'm sorry,*"" she said, walking into our storage closet. ""*I'm sorry I'm late. I'm sorry the chairs look uncomfortable. I'm sorry the lighting is dim. I'm sorry you had to wait.*""

""Susan,"" I said gently, ""you're two minutes early.""

""*I'm sorry.*""

By month two, we had eight regular members. Pretty soon, I'd convinced the community center to give us an actual meeting room.

People started bringing friends. Word spread. Our little support group for ""*unique dependencies*"" grew to fifteen people, then twenty, then thirty. I had to start keeping a waiting list. People kept showing up, but almost no one ever left. A handful moved away or missed a meeting or two, yet they always drifted back, drawn, they said, to the only place that “*understood*.” Alongside my waiting list, I kept a neat column marked **DEPARTED**, but it was always a single blank line. So more people came.

And the addictions got stranger.

Marcus was addicted to counting things in prime numbers. Not counting in general, specifically counting in primes. He'd been fired from three jobs because he couldn't complete tasks that required him to count beyond 97.

Linda was addicted to collecting voicemails from wrong numbers. She'd changed her number seventeen times trying to stop, but somehow the wrong numbers always found her.

James was addicted to closing circles. Not drawing them - closing them. If he saw an incomplete circle anywhere, he had to complete it. He'd been arrested twice for ""*vandalizing*"" incomplete graffiti.

I started researching their conditions online. I couldn't find anything. These weren't recognized addictions. They weren't in any psychology textbooks. They didn't match any known behavioral patterns.

But the people were real. Their suffering was real. And somehow, our group was helping them.

Margaret had gone from buying three umbrellas a week to buying one every two weeks. David had managed to throw away fifty left shoes. Susan could get through entire sentences without apologizing.

*I felt proud. Useful. Like I'd finally found something I was good at.*

**That's when I noticed the pattern.**

It started with small details. Marcus mentioned he'd never had trouble with numbers until he'd found a piece of paper under his car windshield with prime numbers written on it. Linda's wrong number calls had started the day after someone left a voicemail on her work phone that was clearly meant for someone else, except when she'd tried to return the call, the number was disconnected.

James said his circle obsession began after he'd found a perfectly round stone with a small chip in it, sitting on his doorstep. He'd kept the stone, unable to throw it away, and within days was compulsively completing circles everywhere.

""Where did you find your first umbrella?"" I asked Margaret during one session.

She thought about it. ""*It was in my car,*"" she said slowly. ""I'd gone to the grocery store, and when I came back, there was this beautiful blue umbrella in my back seat. I thought maybe I'd bought it and forgotten, but I checked my receipt...""

""*It wasn't on there,*"" I finished.

She stared at me. ""*How did you know?*""

I didn't answer. I couldn't. Because I was starting to realize something that made my stomach turn.

**Every single person in our group had found something.** A trigger object that had appeared in their life without explanation, right before their addiction started.

And I was the only one who hadn't found anything.

I was also the only one who wasn't addicted to anything. 

Yet.

That night, I drove home thinking about what I'd discovered. The evidence was too consistent to ignore. Someone or something was planting these trigger objects. But why? What was the point of creating such specific, bizarre addictions?

I parked in my mom's driveway and sat in the dark for a while, trying to make sense of it all. Finally, I got out of the car and headed for the front door.

That's when I saw it.

Sitting on the porch step, perfectly centered like it had been placed there deliberately, was a small notebook. Black leather cover, no writing on the front. I picked it up and opened it.

The pages were blank except for the first one, which had a single line written in neat handwriting,

""***Document everything.***""

*I should have thrown it away. I should have recognized it for what it was, my trigger object, the thing that would start my own addiction.*

Instead, I took it inside and began to write.

I documented Margaret's progress with her umbrellas. David's left shoe count. Susan's apology frequency. Marcus's prime number incidents. Every detail of every session, every breakthrough, every setback.

At first, I told myself it was for their benefit. Good record-keeping would help me be a better group leader. *The notebook made me feel professional, legitimate.*

But after a week, I realized I couldn't stop writing in it.

*Not wouldn't. Couldn't.*

If I went more than a few hours without documenting something about the group, my hands would start shaking. My vision would blur. I'd break out in cold sweats until I picked up the notebook and wrote something, anything, about our members.

I started attending their individual daily activities, following them to work, to stores, to their homes. Always with the notebook, always writing. Margaret buying umbrellas. David sorting left shoes. Susan apologizing to a fire hydrant.

They didn't seem to mind. In fact, they seemed to expect it.

""*Aren't you going to write that down?*"" Susan would ask when she caught herself starting to apologize.

""*Make sure you get the exact count,*"" Marcus would say when he was tallying prime numbers.

It was like they knew. Like they understood that documenting their addictions was my addiction.

The group kept growing. Thirty, forty, fifty members. People came from other cities, other states. Word was spreading about our ""*unique support group*"" and the people we helped with ""*impossible addictions.*""

But I was starting to notice something else. Something that should have terrified me but instead filled me with a strange sense of completion.

The people who got better, really better, not just managing their dependencies, they didn't stay better for long.

Margaret had thrown away all her umbrellas six months ago. Last week, I saw her at a department store, buying five new ones. When I asked her about it, she just smiled.

""*I realized I don't want to get better,*"" she said. ""*This is who I am now. This is who we all are.*""

She was right. None of them really wanted to recover. They wanted to be understood, accepted, documented.

They wanted their addictions to matter to someone.

And I wanted, needed, to be that someone.

I've been running the group for two years now. We have over one hundred members. People drive hours to attend. We've had to rent the entire community center.

I document everything. Every session, every relapse, every small victory that turns into a bigger defeat. The notebook never runs out of pages, I flip to the back and there are always more blank sheets waiting. And sometimes I think back to that one blank line, DEPARTED.

**Only one person ever tried to leave permanently.**

Her name was Rachel. She'd joined us eight months ago with an addiction to collecting expired coupons. She'd filled three storage units with them, coupons for stores that had closed, products that were discontinued, deals that had expired years before she'd even found them.

Rachel had been making real progress. She'd started throwing away batches of coupons, had even closed one of the storage units. But then she announced she was moving to another state. A fresh start, she said. She wanted to leave the group behind entirely.

I remember documenting her final session in detail. How nervous she seemed. How she kept looking at the exits. How she said she felt like something was watching her.

That was three weeks ago.

Last Tuesday, I flipped through my notebook looking for her entry, planning to write about her successful recovery. But I couldn't find her name anywhere. Not in the member list, not in my session notes, not even in my initial documentation.

*It was like Rachel had never existed.*

I called the storage unit facility where she'd kept her coupons. They had no record of anyone named Rachel. I searched online for any trace of her. Nothing. I even drove to the address she'd given me, the apartment building manager swore the unit she'd supposedly lived in had been vacant for over a year.

But I remembered her. I could see her face, hear her voice talking about her expired Blockbuster coupons.

So I wrote about her anyway, filling page after page with every detail I could remember. But as I wrote, the words seemed to fade. By the time I finished writing, the ink looked pale, ghostly.

*By the next morning, those pages were completely blank.*

I haven't mentioned Rachel to the other group members. Something tells me they wouldn't remember her either. Conversations outside the group never seem to get that deep.

My mom thinks I've finally found my calling. ""*You're helping so many people,*"" she says proudly.

She's right, in a way. I am helping them. I'm helping them embrace their addictions, accept them, celebrate them. I'm showing them that their bizarre dependencies make them special, not broken.

In return, they're helping me with mine.

Because I've realized something about addiction, something that none of the psychology textbooks mention: *the most powerful addiction isn't to substances or behaviors.*

*It's to being needed.*

And I've never needed anything more than I need to keep documenting these people and their beautiful, impossible addictions.

Even though I know, deep down, that none of this is real. That whatever force is creating these trigger objects, whatever entity is manufacturing these dependencies, it's not doing it randomly.

It's doing it for me. To feed my addiction.

Which means I'm not really helping anyone.

**I'm the reason they can't get better.**

So I'm telling you. About the support group, about the addictions, about the notebook that controls what I write.

I'm telling you because I can't stop myself.

And because I need you to know, if you ever find a small object that doesn't belong to you, something that appears without explanation in your car or on your doorstep or in your pocket.

*Don't pick it up.*

*Don't bring it inside.*

*Don't let it start your story.*

Unless you want to end up like me, addicted to something that feeds on my need, serving something that grows stronger with each person trapped.

Our next meeting is Tuesday at 7 PM.

You should come. You'll have a reason by then.

And I'll be there, notebook in hand, ready to document whatever new addiction walks through the door with you.

Because this is what I am now.

**The keeper of impossible addictions.**

This is the most important work I've ever done, and it's not going to stop.

I just opened to a new page. There's already writing there, in that same neat handwriting...",1,1753120249.0,TheArchivistsLedger,0,1.0,False

I generally say yes, but I'm realizing what that feels like for me is a forgetfulness over what I even like to eat.  

For example, I was volunteering at an aid station for a trail run this weekend, the race was 100miles, so the aid station was open from 4pm to 8am.  I'd need to bring coffee and some food with me for the overnight shift.  I couldn't even brainstorm what would make a decent option in terms of snack foods.  My friend ended up bringing cheese and crackers, some blueberries, pretzels and hummus, and a couple Reese's cups.  I was like oh right, I like those things too.  When I took a break I ran to the store and grabbed those exact same snacks. (Funnily enough, I didn't end up eating any of them...)

I also try to meal plan and prep for a few days at a time, and I'm having a hard time even thinking of things to cook or prep.  I can't easily brainstorm meals/foods I like.  It feels like a fog or something when I'm trying to do that task.  Obviously I can do it, it just feels harder to access that file in my brain.

It seems every time I think I have remembered the worst incident, another one pops up but I truly think this takes the cake.

I was 19 (I'm 50 now) and forced to live at home during college; I was a beyond standout student and was denied my first choice of college because it wasn't within a commutable distance.

My parents purchased a car that was ostensibly mine that I used for commuting/daily driving. I say ostensibly because it wasn't titled in my name. 

One day I came home and my father was beaming. He said he wanted to talk to me. He let me know that he had decided to officially title the car in my name because I had proven I was responsible and had continued to get excellent grades while in college. I remember feeling like it was one of the best days of my life when we went to the DMV and did the title transfer. I owned my car, *and* my father was proud of me.

A month or so later, I was home with my mother when two IRS agents showed up. My father was at work. Long story short, my parents were in hot water with the IRS and had not responded to many contact attempts. They were there to impound my car as collateral.

I was shocked. As my mother was offering them coffee (?!?), I was telling them it was my car and I had nothing to do with this. I pulled out the title to prove it. They did not care. I saw there was a tow truck in the driveway and they had started hooking it up.

I begged the agents to let me get some personal belongings from the car, which they did. Then, I watched my car get towed away.

It all hit me like a ton of bricks. Everything he had said to me was a lie. He knew this was coming. He transferred the title to try to protect a piece of his property, not because he was proud of me. 

This is the kind of person my father was. He's been dead a long time now. My mother implied it was my fault he had a stroke. She also blames me for the decision to withdraw life support because she thinks he might have lived, despite the fact that she outright refused to make a decision (forcing me to) and the second and third opinions we got indicated there was a 0% chance of recovery.

# The Game Has Changed - Making Money While You Sleep Is Real

Picture this: You wake up on a Tuesday morning to find your phone buzzing with sales notifications. While you were sleeping, your online business made $847. Your kids need breakfast, so you handle that first. The business keeps running itself.

This isn't some get-rich-quick fantasy. Real people are building autopilot ecommerce stores that generate serious cash with barely any daily work. We're talking about people making $10,000 to $50,000 monthly while working fewer hours than part-timers at coffee shops.

The secret? Dropshipping combined with smart automation tools that actually work now.

# Why Dropshipping is Exploding Right Now

The numbers tell the whole story. The global dropshipping market hit $365.67 billion in 2024. By 2030, experts predict it will reach $1.25 trillion.

That's massive growth. But here's what makes this moment special.

AI tools finally work for regular people. You don't need to be a tech wizard anymore. The software handles product research, marketing, and customer service. What used to take teams of people can now run automatically.

Smart entrepreneurs are cashing in. They're not working harder - they're working smarter.

# What Makes Autopilot Stores Different

# The Old Way Was Broken

Traditional ecommerce meant buying inventory upfront. You'd invest thousands in products that might not sell. You'd spend weeks building a website from scratch. You'd handle shipping, returns, and customer complaints all day long.

That model required huge time investments and financial risks most people couldn't handle.

# The New Way Changes Everything

Autopilot stores flip the script completely. You sell first, then your suppliers ship directly to customers. No inventory. No storage costs. No shipping headaches.

The automation handles the boring stuff. Your store runs itself while you focus on what matters to you.

# How These Money-Making Machines Actually Work

# Ready-to-Launch Store Systems

Starting from zero is the hardest part of any business. Autopilot store providers solve this by giving you complete, ready-to-go websites.

These aren't basic templates. They come with payment systems already connected. The product catalogs are pre-loaded with trending items. The design looks professional from day one.

AI tools scan market data to pick winning products. They build collections customers actually want to buy. You skip months of research and guesswork.

# Automatic Order Processing

When someone buys from your store, here's what happens next. The order goes straight to your supplier. They package and ship the product with your branding. The customer gets exactly what they ordered.

You never touch the product. You never visit a post office. The entire fulfillment process runs without you.

Established dropshipping platforms handle this automatically. They save store owners 10+ hours every week on order processing alone.

# Marketing That Runs Itself

Most businesses fail because they can't get customers. Autopilot stores solve this with pre-built marketing systems.

Ad campaigns launch on day one with proven creatives. AI writes blog posts that drive organic traffic. Social media content gets generated and scheduled automatically.

The marketing works while you sleep. New customers find your store every day without your direct involvement.

# Your Step-by-Step Launch Blueprint

# Step 1 - Pick Your Winning Niche

Don't guess what people want. Use Google Trends to spot real demand. Look for products people search for consistently, not just temporary fads.

Contact business advisors if you need help choosing. Many platforms offer free consultations to help you pick profitable niches.

The best niches combine your interests with market demand. When you care about the products, marketing feels natural instead of forced.

# Step 2 - Choose Your Platform Partner

Not all turnkey providers are equal. Look for all-in-one platforms that handle every piece of the puzzle.

Your ideal platform provides pre-set payment systems. The product catalogs should be pre-loaded and ready to sell. You need access to product databases for future additions.

Don't settle for partial solutions. Find platforms that handle business launch, marketing, and order shipping completely.

# Step 3 - Launch Without Fear

Most people overthink the launch phase. They spend weeks tweaking colors and fonts instead of opening for business.

Launch with what you have. The platform's support team can help with questions. Perfect stores don't make money - live stores do.

Your first goal is getting that first sale, not winning design awards.

# Step 4 - Activate Full Automation

This is where the magic happens. Set up automated order processing so purchases flow straight to suppliers. Enable automatic packing and shipping systems.

Your logistics provider should handle everything. Orders ship from suppliers directly to customers using your business name.

The dropshipping model means you never handle inventory. Your job is managing the systems, not the products.

# Step 5 - Launch Traffic Generation

Outsource marketing services for hands-off promotion. Use pre-made ad creatives instead of starting from scratch.

Implement AI-generated blog posts for organic search traffic. Schedule social media content to run automatically.

Traffic generation should work without daily management. Set it up once, then let it run.

# Step 6 - Handle Customer Communication

This might be your only hands-on task. Respond to customer emails as they come in.

Most automated stores only need 2-4 hours weekly for customer service. The systems handle everything else automatically.

Good customer service builds repeat buyers. This is where personal attention pays off.

# Step 7 - Scale and Optimize

Reinvest profits into scaling winning products. Expand to new channels like Amazon and eBay.

Use sales data to identify top performers. Double down on what works. Cut products that don't sell.

Scaling happens naturally when the foundation is solid.

# Real Success Stories From Regular People

# The Freelance Graphic Designer

Mike worked long hours designing logos and brochures for small businesses. The irregular income stressed him out, especially during slow months.

He started a dropshipping store selling digital art supplies and design tools. Using automated marketing and pre-selected products, Mike built a consistent income stream.

Six months later, his store generates $22,000 monthly. He spends just 3 hours weekly reviewing product suggestions and answering customer emails.

The steady income lets him be pickier about freelance clients. He only takes projects he enjoys now.

# The Part-Time College Professor

Dr. Jennifer taught evening business classes while raising two kids. Her academic schedule was packed, but the pay wasn't enough for her family's needs.

She noticed her students constantly asking about productivity tools and study aids. Jennifer launched a store targeting college students with organizational products.

Her monthly profits hit $31,000 within eight months. The business runs automatically during her teaching hours. She dedicates 4 hours weekly to the store, mostly approving new products and reviewing sales reports.

The extra income paid off her student loans and funded family vacations she couldn't afford before.

# The Restaurant Manager

Carlos managed a busy restaurant chain location for years. The long hours and weekend work were burning him out, but he needed the steady paycheck.

His passion for cooking led him to start a dropshipping store focused on professional kitchen gadgets and specialty cooking tools.

Now he earns $19,500 monthly from his automated store. The income stability let him negotiate better hours at the restaurant. He spends just 2 hours weekly managing the business, mainly responding to customers and adding seasonal products.

Carlos plans to leave restaurant management completely once his store income doubles.

# Why This Works Better Than Other Side Hustles

# No Inventory Nightmare

Traditional product businesses require huge upfront investments. You buy inventory hoping it sells. Unsold products become expensive paperweights.

Dropshipping eliminates inventory risks completely. You only pay suppliers after customers pay you. No storage costs. No spoiled products.

# Location Independence

Your store runs from anywhere with internet. Take that family vacation without losing income. Move to a cheaper city without changing businesses.

The automation means your income isn't tied to your physical location or daily presence.

# Scalable Income Potential

Most side hustles trade time for money directly. More hours equals more income. There's always a ceiling.

Automated stores scale differently. More customers don't require proportionally more work. The systems handle increased volume automatically.

# Common Mistakes That Kill Profits

# Picking Oversaturated Markets

Everyone wants to sell phone cases and fidget spinners. These markets are crowded with competitors fighting over scraps.

Research market demand before committing. Use tools like Google Trends to find growing niches with room for new players.

# Skipping the Automation Setup

Some people try to run everything manually to save money. They end up working 60-hour weeks for minimum wage profits.

Automation costs money upfront but saves massive time later. Pay for systems that work without you.

# Ignoring Customer Service

Automated doesn't mean abandoned. Customers still need help with orders, returns, and questions.

Budget 2-4 hours weekly for customer communication. Good service creates repeat buyers and positive reviews.

# Choosing Unreliable Suppliers

Your reputation depends on product quality and shipping speed. Cheap suppliers can destroy your business with defective products and slow delivery.

Research supplier reviews and test orders before committing. Reliable suppliers cost slightly more but protect your brand.

# The Technology That Makes This Possible

# AI Product Research

Modern AI tools analyze market trends, competition levels, and profit potential automatically. They identify winning products before human researchers spot them.

These tools process massive amounts of data in minutes. Manual research would take weeks to match their insights.

# Automated Ad Creation

AI generates ad copy, selects images, and optimizes campaigns for maximum return on investment. The technology learns what works and improves performance over time.

You get professional-level advertising without hiring expensive agencies or learning complex platforms.

# Smart Inventory Management

Backend systems track supplier stock levels and automatically remove out-of-stock items from your store. They add new trending products based on market data.

Your catalog stays fresh and available without manual updates.

# Customer Service Automation

Chatbots handle basic questions like order status, shipping times, and return policies. Complex issues get routed to humans automatically.

Customers get instant answers to simple questions. You handle only problems that need personal attention.

# Investment Requirements and Realistic Timelines

# Starting Costs

Most autopilot store platforms charge $29-199 monthly for access to their systems and support. Some require setup fees of $500-2000 for premium features.

Marketing budgets vary widely. Start with $500-1000 monthly for advertising. Scale up as profits grow.

Total startup costs typically range from $1000-5000 for serious beginners.

# Timeline to Profitability

Realistic expectations matter. Most successful stores take 3-6 months to reach consistent profitability.

Month 1-2: Store setup, product selection, initial marketing launch. Month 3-4: Optimization based on early sales data, scaling winning products. Month 5-6: Consistent profit generation, expansion planning.

Some stores hit profitability faster. Others take longer. Success depends on niche selection, marketing quality, and market conditions.

# Income Potential

Conservative estimates for well-run stores:

* Months 1-3: $0-2,000 monthly profit
* Months 4-6: $2,000-8,000 monthly profit
* Months 7-12: $8,000-25,000 monthly profit

Top performers exceed these numbers significantly. Income scales with reinvestment and optimization efforts.

# Legal and Tax Considerations

# Business Structure Setup

Register your business properly from the start. Most dropshippers choose LLC structures for liability protection and tax benefits.

Consult with business attorneys and accountants. Proper setup prevents expensive problems later.

# Tax Planning

Dropshipping income is taxable business revenue. Track expenses like platform fees, advertising costs, and professional services.

Set aside 25-30% of profits for taxes. Quarterly estimated payments prevent year-end surprises.

# International Regulations

Selling across borders involves customs, duties, and international shipping regulations. Your platform should handle compliance automatically.

Research requirements for your target markets. Some countries have specific restrictions on certain product categories.

# Building Long-Term Wealth

# Reinvestment Strategies

Successful store owners reinvest 50-70% of profits back into growth. They expand product lines, test new marketing channels, and improve automation systems.

Short-term thinking kills long-term wealth. Build systems that compound over time.

# Multiple Income Streams

Smart entrepreneurs launch multiple stores in different niches. Diversification protects against market changes and seasonal fluctuations.

Start with one store. Add others once the first one runs smoothly.

# Exit Planning

Profitable automated stores become valuable business assets. They sell for 2-4 times annual profit to investors seeking passive income.

Build with exit value in mind. Document systems and maintain clean financial records.

# Your Action Plan for This Week

# Research Phase (Day 1-2)

Spend 30 minutes daily on Google Trends. Screenshot 5 potential niche ideas. Research competition levels and profit margins for each option.

Contact 3 platform providers for consultations. Compare features, costs, and support quality.

# Decision Phase (Day 3-4)

Narrow down to your top niche choice. Consider your interests, market size, and competition levels.

Select your platform partner. Look for free trials or money-back guarantees to reduce risk.

# Launch Phase (Day 5-7)

Set up your test store using the platform's onboarding process. Import products and configure payment systems.

Launch your first marketing campaigns with small budgets. Start collecting data immediately.

Enable all available automation features. The goal is hands-off operation from day one.

# The Reality Check

Building passive income takes work upfront. The ""autopilot"" part comes after you build solid foundations.

Most people quit during the setup phase. They want instant results without investing time in learning the systems.

Success requires patience and persistence. The entrepreneurs making $20,000+ monthly put in focused effort for 3-6 months first.

But here's the payoff: Once your systems work, they create income while you sleep, travel, or spend time with family.

The freedom to work on your terms makes the initial effort worthwhile.

# Why Most People Never Start

Fear stops more dreams than failure ever will. People research endlessly without taking action. They wait for perfect conditions that never come.

The platforms offer free trials because they know something important. The hardest part isn't learning the technology - it's clicking ""start"" while Netflix and comfort call your name.

But here's what successful store owners know: A year from now, you'll wish you had started today.

The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is right now.

Your automated store is waiting. The only question is whether you'll build it or keep wondering what might have been.

The choice is yours.

  A savage kick to Princess Bettina of Abaddon's back severed her spinal cord.  
  
  A blessing.  
  
  The searing pain that had been clawing through her entire being faded below her waist to pinpoints of pressure, then tingles, then . . .  
  
  Nothing.  
  
  Blessing. She'd long since stopped begging for her life, knew she'd never leave this field of poppies alive.  
  
  The four winged monsters who'd dragged her here had plans for her: as much agony as possible before her death.  
  
  Just as their kind had delivered to her sorceress mother twenty years before.  
  
  Though half demon, Bettina was weak in body, hopeless at fighting. She'd depended on her Sorceri power for protection-the one that these Vrekeners had siphoned from her as easily as they'd snatched the clothes from her body.  
  
  No longer could she open her swollen eyes. Her last sight? The leader standing over her, brandishing a scythe, his eyes frenzied. His claw-tipped wings had blocked the light of a low yellow moon. The scythe's blade wasn't fashioned out of metal, but of black flame. . . .  
  
  Yet Bettina could still hear, was still aware. In the distance, a new age band played in an outdoor arena. Young mortals danced and sang-  
  
  The force of one kick jostled her over onto her belly. Her mauled face shoved against crushed poppies. The leader played with her as a hawk would a mouse, ravaging the meat from its bones. His followers jeered and doused her with bottles of spirits.  
  
  Menacing yells, steel-toed boots, the blistering sting of alcohol.  
  
  Ah, gods, she was too aware. She tried desperately to lose herself in memories of a boy with smiling blue eyes and sun-kissed hair.  
  
  He doesn't know how much I love him. So many things I wish I'd done-  
  
  Her upper body exploded with even more pain, as if to compensate for the numbness in her fractured legs. She could perceive her broken ribs jutting from her skin. Her mangled arms draped limply across the ground where they'd fallen when she'd last tried to protect her head. . . . Anguish multiplied.  
  
  Or perhaps the Vrekeners' blows rained down more swiftly. The kill was near.  
  
  All she'd wanted was to go to a party with her mortal college friends. She'd been excited, happy to fit in with them, or to appear to-as a halfling, she'd never fit in before. Little did she know that she'd already drawn her enemy's notice with her sorcery. She'd never intentionally used it-  
  
  Over all other pain, she perceived the heat of that burning scythe descending ever closer to her. Hotter, hotter, scorching.  
  
  Alcohol on her skin, the black flame . . .  
  
  Bettina choked on a sob. They planned to burn her?  
  
  Suddenly she felt weightless. This is what dying feels like?  
  
  No, she was traveling. Summoned? Dear gods, yes, the demon in her had been summoned across realms. Naked, powerless, sightless, she slipped from that field in the mortal world to her home plane of Abaddon.  
  
  In a flash, the poppies were replaced by cold marble, a balm on what was left of her skin. That awareness returned. I'm lying on the floor of my castle's court, broken, wearing only my blood and the Vrekeners' rank liquor. The courtiers still gossip and laugh. Can't they see me?  
  
  She tried to scream for help; blood bubbled up over her lips. Can't scream, can't move. She could only listen. A conversation between her godfather Raum-the Grand Duke of the Deathly Ones-and another was already under way.  
  
  ""Now you've done it, Raum. "" It was Caspion the Tracker. The demon she secretly loved. ""Tina hates being summoned with that medallion. "" Not at present! ""She considers it a leash. ""  
  
  Her guardians had insisted on it, a condition of her leaving Abaddon.  
  
  ""Ha! It probably makes her feel more like a demon,"" Raum said in a gruff tone, knowing that wasn't true. They'd had words over his use of the mystical medallion. ""Besides, she told me she was coming home from college by month's end. ""  
  
  ""You know time moves differently in the mortal realm,"" Caspion said, amusement lacing his words. ""And more, she said she was very busy but would try to visit-""  
  
  Bettina heard a courtier gasp. They've seen me. Murmurs rose to a furor.  
  
  From the front of the court, Caspion demanded, ""What is it?"" Closer by, he asked, ""Who is this pitiful creature? No, no, this isn't Tina. It can't be!"" A touch on her forehead . . . a sucked in breath of recognition . . . a roar of grief. ""Bettina!""  
  
  Raum bellowed, ""What has happened?""  
  
  ""Tina, wake up!"" Caspion commanded her. ""Ah, gods, stay with me. Stay. ""  
  
  For him, she managed to slit open one eye. His curling blond hair hung over his harried face. His own eyes had gone from midnight blue to black, signaling his emotion. They even started watering as he gazed over her injuries.  
  
  She saw a shining hero of old. Her beloved Cas.  
  
  He yanked off his warm coat, covering her. ""A physic!"" he yelled into the crowd. ""Now!""  
  
  Others gathered around her. She heard Raum stomping closer. ""Who's done this to my little Tina?"" Something broke directly. No doubt from his fist. ""Damn you, tell me! Who's hurt her?""  
  
  She tried to answer, parting her lips. . . . Her jaw must be broken.  
  
  Another anguished roar. Oh, Cas.  
  
  Visibly making an effort to control himself, he said, ""You hang on and stay with me. ""  
  
  There's nowhere else I'd rather be than with you.  
  
  ""I'll get you through this, Tina. I swear it. You're going to be all right,"" he said, his voice thick. ""Don't leave me. ""  
  
  Bettina felt the tiniest sliver of hope, something to fight for. Surely Cas returned her feelings, saw her as more than a little sister.  
  
  ""Will she live?"" Raum bit out. ""She's not hardy like a demoness, not strong like we are. ""  
  
  She hadn't been a true demon before. Now she was no longer a true sorceress. They took my root power. My soul.  
  
  A male she didn't recognize asked, ""Has she frozen into her immortality?"" The physic?  
  
  Cas answered, ""She was on the cusp. Maybe by now . . . ""  
  
  ""We need a Sorceri healer. If we act quickly, the princess could recover,"" the physic said, but hastily qualified his statement: ""Her body could recover from this. ""  
  
  What did that mean?  
  
  Raum ordered, ""Find Tina's godmother! Don't return from the Sorceri plane without Morgana!"" Coming into Bettina's line of vision, Raum yelled to Cas, ""I should never have let her go! I was too lenient! Things will change in Abaddon!"" His eyes were glinting, his voice choked up. The crusty old warrior was at a loss. He began ramming his horns against a stone wall, roaring to everyone, ""Heed my words! We return to olden ways!""  
  
  Free of the attack, Bettina's body started trying to regenerate, nerves sparking to life once more. Pain erupted all over her, blistering waves of it.  
  
  Even in the midst of her escalating agony and lingering horror, the words olden ways struck fear in her heart.  
  
  Prince Trehan Daciano shot awake in the middle of the day, bolting upright from his pallet of furs.  
  
  He gazed around in confusion, seeing his usual surroundings-shelves of books, weapons, his sideboard with carafes of mead-laced blood.  
  
  Though he'd experienced no nightmare, sleep had been snatched from him, replaced by a marked unease. With each moment, he grew even more on edge, a feeling like . . . like emptiness settling in his chest.  
  
  Like dread. So different from his usual numbness.  
  
  Brows drawn, he rose, tracing across the spacious room to one of the curtained balconies.  
  
  These grand apartments had once been the royal library. Centuries ago, he'd moved in and never moved out, haunting this place until no other member of the family would enter.  
  
  Time and history seeped from these familiar stones. He knew every cra  
g and groove as well as he knew his own grim reflection. Like these stones, I quietly endure the ages.  
  
  Drawing back the thick curtain, he gazed outside. From this height, Trehan could survey far into the Realm of Blood and Mist, the secreted lands of the mighty Dacians.  
  
  The royal city below was still at this hour. Only the sound of Dacia's bubbling blood fountains could be heard.  
  
  Across from his residence stood the majestic black stone castle, the heart of the realm-abandoned without a king. How many of his kinsmen had perished trying to seize that keep? How much deceit and murder surrounded it?  
  
  The warring houses of the royal family had once boasted hundreds of members each-now dwindled down to a handful.  
  
  For an immortal family, they knew death so well.  
  
  Trehan was the last born to the House of Shadow, the assassin arm of the family. Though he was a potential contender for the crown-along with four of his lethal cousins-he had no real aspiration to seize it. A quiet loner by nature, he loathed spectacle and attention, was content to blend into the shadows.  
  
  He only wanted to perform his duty. For nearly a millennium, he'd been the enforcer of law, a merciless assassin.  
  
  As his long-dead father had oft told him, ""You are the sword of the kingdom, Trehan. Dacia will be your family, your friend, your mistress, the grand love of your life. That is your lot, Son. Want for nothing else. And you will never be disappointed. ""  
  
  Trehan had once foolishly entertained secret hopes, but he'd eventually embraced his father's teachings. As was logical.  
  
  I want for nothing. This was his lot, to await down here in the earth until Mother Dacia needed his sword. To strike, execute, then return.  
  
  So why this unaccountable restlessness? This sudden . . . frustration?  
  
  It was similar to that niggling feeling of some task forgotten. Except this feeling had teeth, gnawing at his chest.  
  
  And why should Trehan have a sense of something left undone? He always did everything that was expected of him. Ever cold, ever rational Trehan couldn't explain this.  
  
  What have I left undone? Rubbing a palm over his chest, Trehan crossed to one of countless bookshelves. He selected a recently acquired explorer's narrative, adjourning to his favorite seat before the fire, planning to lose himself in tales of life outside this mountain, of emotions he never felt, and interactions he never experienced.  
  
  Not on this day.  
  
  After rereading the same page a dozen times, he closed the tome, staring into the flames as he struggled to identify the hollow ache in his dormant heart.  
  
  His fingers tightened on the book, sinking into the cover. Gods damn it, what have I left undone?  
  
  Yet the dread only mounted. Then came one word, a whisper in his mind. . . .  
  
  Protect.  
  
  The Plane of Abaddon,  
  
  Demonarchy of the Deathly Ones  
  
  THREE MONTHS LATER  
  
  Bettina, you don't understand,"" Caspion muttered as he gazed out into the night. He clutched the balcony rail with one hand and a silver mug of demon brew with the other. ""I've done something that I can't undo, something that even I can't talk my way out of. ""  
  
  Bettina stood beside him at the rail, drink in hand as well. ""Oh, for gold's sake, what could possibly be so bad?""  
  
  Bad was recovering for months from a savage beating, then returning to ""olden ways. ""  
  
  Bad was being offered up as a tournament prize by one's godparents.  
  
  ""Can you not relax, Cas? Enjoy the night and tell me what worries you. "" Though her apartments in one of Castle Rune's great spires were now a sort of jail, the view couldn't be beaten.  
  
  Her balcony circled the entire spire and was elevated above the fog that swathed the medieval town of Rune below. From here, she and Caspion could see the tops of the giant moonraker trees that stretched from the marsh five hundred feet into the air. Bats jagged in front of the waxing moon.  
  
  The setting was as romantic as she could have hoped. Sidling closer to Cas, she basked in the warmth emanating from his big warrior's body. But he exhaled wearily, taking a drink from his mug, his troubled gaze fixed below him.  
  
  As an adult death demon, Cas could see in the dark, could even penetrate Rune's infamous fog bank. What was he watching for? Why was he nervous?  
  
  She hated seeing her soon-to-be lover in this condition. His eyes were bloodshot, his golden hair disheveled. Fatigue was etched into his normally flawless face.  
  
  ""Surely my predicament must be worse than yours. "" She was about to be married off to whichever ""suitor"" prevailed in the upcoming tournament for her hand. Unless I seduce Cas tonight . . . ""Did you get caught bedding another nobleman's daughter?"" she asked, biting back her jealousy. Caspion was legendary for his conquests.  
  
  ""If only that was all. "" He downed his brew.  
  
  So Bettina drained her mug as well, coughing as she finished. She'd never had more than a few sips of this potent concoction before tonight, preferring lighter Sorceri wines. But she was on a mission, would do anything to achieve it.  
  
  ""Easy, girl,"" Cas said with a ghost of his usual heartbreaking grin. ""That drink gains on you with each drop. ""  
  
  Eyes watering, she forced a smile. ""It tastes so . . . different. "" Like fermented ghoul urine, I imagine.  
  
  Bettina knew that this brew left one relatively sober up to a tipping point, beyond which sudden drunkenness ensued. Then one became tore up from the floor up, as her snarky new servant would say.  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  Hey, as long as Cas was drunk with her. ""I'd love some more, darling. Let's go back inside. "" Back to my softly lit apartments and cozy settee.  
  
  ""A final cup, then,"" he muttered, turning toward her sitting area.  
  
  Inside her spire, all twelve rooms were filled with imported silks and antiques, adorned with flame chandeliers of the finest crystal. Everything was luxurious, polished splendor.  
  
  Well, everything except the small, dented copper bell on her coffee table. . . .  
  
  After pouring them another round, Cas sank down on the settee, raking his fingers through his curling hair.  
  
  She joined him there, gazing at his handsome visage and muscled frame with a sigh of appreciation.  
  
  Standing more than six and a half feet tall, he towered over her five-and-a-half-foot height. His eyes were a hypnotic blue, turning stormy black with strong emotions. His proud horns were the ideal size, curving back along his fair head like a Grecian wreath. He kept them polished; they glinted like amber in the candlelight of her room.  
  
  He had sublime features-a strong chin, broad cheekbones, and full, kissable lips. She could only imagine how incredible those lips would feel against her own. They'd never kissed, had never touched beyond a hug.  
  Shed fallen for Caspion from the moment shed first seen him ten years ago, when shed been only twelve. Her beloved sire, King Mathar, had just died, and she and Raum had been presiding over Abaddons royal court. Or at least Raum had been presiding, reluctantly.  
  
  Just three years older than Bettina, Cas had come striding into the chamber, dashing in his armor. All conversation had stopped, the crowd parting as hed offered a bound bounty-one of her realms most feared foes.  
  
  He didnt present it to Raum. But to her.  
  
  Shed still been in the depths of grief, feeling all alone, like a hornless Sorceri imposter who would never belong among the martial Abaddonae. But then a ray of sun had caught Caspion, highlighting those blond locks, setting his eyes aglow. Like a sign.  
  
  And shed known that her life would never be the same.  
  
  Besides the fact that they were both orphans, theyd had little in common. Shed been a wealthy royal, treated like a fragile porcelain doll; hed been found in an alley as a downy-horned toddler and had grown up begging in the streets. Shed been filled with self-doubt, wondering how a peculiar halfling like her could ever be queen; hed been bold and brash, determined to make his mark, to earn the respect of the Abaddonae.  
  
  And yet the unlikeliest of friendships had blossomed. After that first day, shed followed Caspion everywhere.  
  
  In the years to come, hed routinely sneaked her offplane, teleporting her to the world of mortals so they could discover those new lands together. Hed eventually taken her on his less dangerous bounty hunts, while shed marveled at his talent in tracking his prey.  
  
  Theyd shared each others secrets: his continual sexual dalliances; her modern ideals and fears about assuming the crown once she came of age and was wed.  
  
  Yet after all theyd been through together, Cas still considered her his best friend and nothing more. Perhaps this was because her looks werent on par with his-or demonic in the least. Her features were most often described as ""elfin. "" One problem: she wasnt an elf.  
  
  Maybe her breasts were just too small. She glanced down, briefly glaring at them.  
  
  Didnt matter. For all her physical shortcomings, tonight she would attempt to change her friendship with Cas, to elevate it.  
  
  In preparation, shed extinguished the chandeliers and lit a few candles throughout the rooms. Shed procured several jugs of demon brew, then dismissed the guards stationed outside her door.  
  
  And shed dressed for the occasion.  
  
  ""Wont you tell me whats going on, my darling?"" she asked, edging closer. ""You always trust me with your secrets. You know Ill keep them forever. ""  
  
  ""My problem doesnt concern you,"" he said, absently rubbing his throat. ""It mustnt. ""  
  
  ""Hmm. Very well. "" Shed try another tack. ""You havent complimented me on my outfit. "" Bettina had grown accustomed to the jeans, sandals, and T-shirts shed worn during her two-semester stint at college, but in Abaddon, shed returned to dressing as her foremothers had.  
  
  In other words, shed clad herself in provocative clothes, plaited her dark hair into wild, disordered braids, and donned as much gold jewelry as her body could carry.  
  
  As was the Sorceri way, she also wore a mask. The scarlet silk was a thin band around her eyes, making their color stand out-champagne-brown irises circled with a ring of black. According to her godmother, Morgana, her wide eyes were her best feature.  
  
  But now Cas barely spared a glance at her red lace-up bodice or her skimpy black skirt with slits up to her hips. The thigh-high boots encasing her legs in soft leather evoked no reaction. He said nothing about the gold armlets winding up each arm, the matching collar around her neck, or the diadem perched upon her head.  
  
  A master goldsmith, Bettina had created each of the pieces in her workshop-adding a surprise design modification. She was secretly proud of her skill.  
  
  ""Very pretty,"" he said in a distracted tone, glancing in her direction. ""You grow prettier with each year. ""  
  
  Shed read in a womens magazine that a male who liked you wanted to watch you all the time. Youd catch his eyes on you constantly.  
  
  Sometimes Cas didnt look at her at all. When he did, sometimes he didnt seem to see her.  
  
  No, I must snare his attention! One of two fates awaited her, depending on the outcome of her mission tonight.  
  
  If she succeeded in seducing Cas, she would wed her hearts desire and be forever protected by the only male shed ever loved. They would become king and queen of the Deathly Ones and live out their eternal lives together.  
  
  If she failed with her demon, a tournament would begin for her hand-and for the crown of Abaddon. Bettina had seen the caliber of contestants beginning to file into Rune.  
  
  Swilling demon lords who already had dozens of brutalized wives.  
  
  Snakelike Cerunnos who would expect her to feed their spawn-with her flesh.  
  
  A troll that wasnt an anatomical match for her.  
  
  She knew none of them desired her; they only wanted the throne. Reminded of her prospects, she laid her hand on Cass thigh, saying in a breathy murmur, ""Its been so lonely without you here these past few weeks. "" She edged even closer. ""You still wont confess where in the Lore you went off to?""  
  
  ""Doesnt concern you,"" he said, but shed known him long enough to know she was wearing him down.  
  
  ""Please talk to me, Cas. "" She twirled the ends of her bodice laces, trying to draw his attention to her diminutive-but expertly displayed-breasts. ""Take my mind off my fate. ""  
  
  ""And that is another worry I contend with. "" He clenched his mug until the handle bent. ""How could your godparents do this to you?""  
  
  Though Raum and Morgana, the Queen of Sorceri, were lifelong foes of each other, they agreed on one thing: Bettinas need for a husband/protector/king. But since they couldnt agree on a particular male-or even a particular species-theyd decided to host this tournament.  
  
  Searching only for the strongest champion in the Lore, theyd opened it to all creatures.  
  
  Olden ways. Abaddon had once been known for blood sport within its notorious Iron Ring-and for virgins offered up as prizes.  
  
  Bettina knew her two guardians loved her; they meant well. She also knew how fortunate she was to have them in her life. Halflings born of two hostile species were often shunned by both.  
  
  ""I agreed to all their terms, Cas. "" She remembered that fateful conversation. Shed been sobbing, telling them, ""Yes, yes, Ill do anything. Just get me my power back!"" Sinister and destructive as it might be.  
  
  Cas scoffed. ""Agreed? You mean they manipulated you. ""  
  
  If Bettina ever got famous enough in the Lore to earn a trailing name-like Maksimillia the Butcher or Lothaire the Enemy of Old-it would probably be Bettina the Pushover. Maybe Bettina the Easy Mark.  
  
  ""Always, they get their way with you!""  
  
  Not always. Last year, shed stunned everyone-including herself-and defied her guardians in order to attend a mortal design college. Ever since she was young, shed been obsessed with fashion and jewelry creation, the Sorceri love of gold and garb running deep in her. Shed consumed every book on the subject and had been hungry to learn more and hone her craft.  
  
  Far from the prying eyes of Castle Rune, Bettina had been a carefree Lorean, blending with humans, enjoying freedom, new friends, and even her own flat with electricity and modern amenities! No longer had she been a halfling freak among hardy demons-shed been a design geek, immersed in a tribe of them.  
  
  One night had changed her entire life. She swallowed, tamping down that memory. ""I wasnt exactly in a position to resist my guardians again. ""  
  
  The first-and last-time shed defied them, shed been punished to within an inch of her life.  
  
  Itd taken her two months to convalesce; being part Sorceri and on the cusp of immortality meant she had healed fully-but slowly. The only thing that had gotten her through it?  
  
  Caspion.  
  
  Each day, hed sat at her bedside, entertaining her with tales of his debauched companions, a randy pack of young demon males.  
  
  And ea  
ch night hed hunted her attackers relentlessly. Sixty days of hardly eating or sleeping.  
  
  But a month ago, Raum had ordered an exhausted Cas off the trail, promising that a cadre of soldiers would take over. Bitterly disappointed, Cas had vanished, returning only last night.  
  
  Now he took another drink. ""Why in the gods names didnt you wait for me to come back before you agreed to something like this tournament?""  
  
  Because my godparents pushed so hard. Because I feel unwhole without my power. Because they withheld the worst details of this medieval fiasco.  
  
  ""I had little recourse. "" And even less now. In fact, Bettina had only one move available to her: seduce Caspion. Only a virgin could be offered up for the tournament. ""And besides, I had no idea when you would return since you left me no word. "" Over the years, hed disappeared from time to time, going on his more perilous hunts-or benders or attending orgies or whatever else he and his wild friends did.  
  
  ""Whats done is done, Cas. The fact remains that unless I come up with a way out of this tournament before the start tomorrow night, Im going to be married off to a stranger by the end of next week. ""  
  
  His voice barely above a whisper, he said, ""Im going to be dead by the end of the night. ""  
  
  Chills raced over her. ""You cant say something like that, then not explain. Arent we friends?""  
  
  ""So many things Ive wanted to do,"" Cas said, his eyes distant. ""So many things Ive never even begun. ""  
  
  Shed felt the exact same way in that field of poppies.  
  
  He finally faced her. ""Remember when we were going to travel the rest of the worlds? See every single demonic plane in the Lore?""  
  
  ""We can still do that. ""  
  
  ""No, Tina. "" He ran a palm down the leg of his black pants. ""Ive broken one of their laws. They will send him. Straight from the Realm of Blood and Mist. ""  
  
  ""Who?"" Bettina demanded. Shed never heard of this realm. ""Who do you think will hurt you?""  
  
  Who could? Caspion was an adult demon male, now fully immortal. He was also a talented swordsman. Shed watched him train for countless hours. Even now his ever-present sword glinted proudly from the sheath at his side.  
  
  So why was his expression one of obvious dread? Shed never seen the stalwart Cas like this.  
  
  He suddenly looked his age: a young twenty-five. ""They have a secret kingdom, hidden from the Lore. . . . ""  
  
  Oh, yes, he was on the verge of telling all. ""Go on, darling. ""  
  
  ""Their people rarely leave-and then only in a cloaking mist that makes them invisible. Though most otherlanders are forbidden within, I had a powerful friend, a sponsor of sorts, so I was allowed inside. "" He paused for a long drink. ""But once an otherlander enters, he cant ever leave-except upon pain of death. Yet I did. I couldnt stay in that place any longer, one just as primitive as Abaddon. Here, at least Im free to roam where I will! And my sponsor . . . he changed. Drastically. So I escaped, never thinking their killer could find me on our plane, but I sense him. Already I sense him in Abaddon. ""  
  
  ""Tell me who is looking for you!""  
  
  Staring past her, he muttered, ""The Prince of Shadow. The most soulless bastard Ive ever met. He comes in the mist, an assassin without equal. To be targeted by him is to be as good as dead. ""  
  
  ""No! Well fight this male. Ill sic the entire army on him, place a bounty on his head! What type of Lorean is he?""  
  
  ""The kind our army cant fight. Ah, Tina, I shouldnt have left here, should never have gone there to begin with! I was just so godsdamned frustrated, after failing over and over. . . . Now the last thing Ill see is a crescent moon. ""  
  
  ""My darling, youre not making any sense,"" she said, desperate to stop this assassin. She would gut any foe of his with her new blade-the secret one shed designed to slip into her gold collar. ""Let me repay all your kindness to me, Cas. I can help you now. ""  
  
  ""Without your power?""  
  
  How matter-of-factly he spoke about that, while she suffered chills. ""Then Salem can help. "" Salem, her new ""servant. ""  
  
  Once a phantom warrior, able to solidify his body at will, hed been cursed to be a sylph-an invisible spirit, an air elemental. He could possess just about anything-a raven, a pillow, a clock. She would order him to keep an eye out for this mysterious assassin.  
  
  Instead of always spying on me. Did Morgana and Raum actually expect her to believe that Salem was a mere domestic? Shed barely shooed the sylph out of her rooms before Cas had arrived tonight. ""Salems telekinesis is surprisingly powerful-""  
  
  ""No one can help me. "" Cas stood unsteadily, unfolding his tall form. ""I must go, meet with some friends. Settle my accounts. Tell no one of this, Tina, or you betray my trust. ""  
  
  Shooting to her feet, she cried, ""Please dont leave. "" He could be going to his death!  
  
  ""My cards have been dealt. At least no one can say I didnt pay what I owed. "" He gave a bitter laugh, as if at an inside joke.  
  
  She grabbed his brawny arm. ""Then return here tonight. ""  
  
  He shrugged. ""Maybe. ""  
  
  ""No, not maybe. "" Recalling his many conquests and his love of females, she glanced up at him from under her lashes, licking her lips. ""Come back to me, and Ill welcome you with open arms, Caspion. ""  
  
  He groaned. ""Youre still a virgin, and the future queen of Abaddon. Id have to wed you to bed you. ""  
  
  ""Okay! Youd make an incredible king. ""  
  
  ""Really? The Abaddonae welcoming the guttersnipe orphan as ruler?""  
  
  Some of the old guard Deathly Ones held him in low esteem because hed been a foundling with no land or family name, but . . . ""Youve been making such strides, Cas. ""  
  
  She alone knew how much he yearned for acceptance. Though he reveled hard-he worked harder, accumulating wealth with each bounty.  
  
  He gave her a sad smile. ""You know I cant have you. ""  
  
  For half a decade, shed assured herself that he hesitated because of the difference in their stations. All she had to do was help him see his own worth.  
  
  Or maybe he simply needed to sow his wild oats before settling down.  
  
  Chapter 3  
  
  After all, who could possibly adore him more than she did? Though he must have guessed her feelings long before now, she finally confessed to his face, ""But I . . . I love you, Cas. ""

I'm sitting here trying to get work done and it's chilly and rainy outside. I'm not sure exactly why the nostalgia is hitting, but it feels like a good day to be young and full of excitement. Reminds me of a road trip with my then girlfriend, now wife, randomly stopping at a cute little cafe to get hopped up on coffee. I don't think it was raining that day but the feeling is the same - day by day, anything is possible and anything can be an adventure.

I often say how as a very functional autistic alcoholic, alcohol improved my life dramatically, and it did, but something about this rainy nostalgia feeling is extremely sober and relaxing.",4,1753119571.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False
1m5ph83,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1m5ph83/fourth_grave_beneath_my_feet_novel_read_online/,Fourth Grave Beneath My Feet Novel Read online Free," I sat watching the Buy From Home Channel with my dead aunt Lillian and wondered what my life would’ve been like had I not just eaten an entire carton of Ben & Jerry’s Chocolate Therapy with a mocha latte chaser. Probably about the same, but it was something to think about.  
  
  A midmorning sun filtered through the blinds and cut hard streaks of light across my body, casting me in an ultra-cool film noir effect. Since my life had definitely taken a turn toward the dark side, film noir fit. It would have fit even better if I weren’t wearing Star Wars pajama bottoms and a sparkly tank top that proudly proclaimed EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY. But I just didn’t have the energy that morning to change into something less inappropriate. I’d been having lethargy issues for a few weeks now. And I was suddenly a tad agoraphobic. Ever since a man named Earl tortured me.  
  
  It sucked.  
  
  The torture. Not his name.  
  
  My name, on the other hand, was Charlotte Davidson, but most people called me Charley.  
  
  “Can I talk to you, pumpkin cheeks?”  
  
  Or pumpkin cheeks, one of the many pet names involving the fall fruit that Aunt Lillian insisted on calling me. Aunt Lil had died sometime in the sixties, and I could see her because I’d been born the grim reaper, which basically meant three things: One, I could interact with dead people—those departed who didn’t cross over when they died—and usually did so on a daily basis. Two, I was super-duper bright to those in the spiritual realm, and the aforementioned dead people could see me from anywhere in the world. When they were ready to cross, they could cross through me. Which brought me to three—I was a portal from the earthly plane to what many refer to as heaven.  
  
  There was a tad more to it than that—including things I had yet to learn myself—but that was the basic gist of my day job. The one I didn’t actually get paid to do. I was also a PI, but that gig wasn’t paying the bills either. Not lately, anyway.  
  
  I rolled my head along the back of the sofa toward Aunt Lil, who was actually a great-aunt on my father’s side. A thin, elderly woman with soft gray eyes and pale blue hair, she was wearing her usual attire, as dead people rarely changed clothes: a leather vest over a floral muumuu and love beads, the ensemble a testament to her demise in the sixties. She also had a loving smile that tilted a bit south of kilter. But that only made me adore her all the more. I had a soft spot for crazy people. I wasn’t sure how the muumuu came into play, with her being so tiny and all—she looked like a pole with a collapsed tent gathered about her fragile hips—but who was I to judge?  
  
  “You can absolutely talk to me, Aunt Lil.” I tried to straighten but couldn’t get past the realization that movement of any kind would take effort. I’d been sitting on one sofa or another for two months, recovering from the torture thing. Then I remembered that the cookware I’d been waiting for all morning was up next. Surely Aunt Lil would understand. Before she could say anything, I raised a finger to put her in pause mode. “But can our talk wait until the stone-coated cookware is over? I’ve been eyeing this cookware for a while now. And it’s coated. With stone.”  
  
  “You don’t cook.”  
  
  She had a point. “So what’s up?” I propped my bunny-slippered feet on the coffee table and crossed my legs at the ankles.  
  
  “I’m not sure how to tell you this.” Her breath hitched, and she bowed her blue head.  
  
  I straightened in alarm despite the energy it took. “Aunt Lil?”  
  
  She tucked her chin in sadness. “I—I think I’m dead.”  
  
  I blinked. Stared at her a moment. Then blinked again.  
  
  “I know.” She sniffled into the massive sleeve of her muumuu, and the love beads shifted soundlessly with the movement. Inanimate objects in death carried an eerie silence. Like mimes. Or that scream Al Pacino did in The Godfather: Part III when his daughter died on those steps. “I know, I know.” She patted my shoulder in consolation. “It’s a lot to absorb.”  
  
  Aunt Lillian died long before I was born, but I had no idea if she knew that or not. Many departed didn’t. Because of this doubt, I’d never mentioned it. For years, I’d let her make me invisible coffee in the morning  
s or cook me invisible eggs; then she’d go off on another adventure. Aunt Lil was still sowing her wild oats. A world traveler, that one. And she rarely stayed in one place very long. Which was good. Otherwise, I’d never get real coffee in the mornings. Or the twelve other times during the day I needed a java fix. If she were around more often, I’d go through caffeine withdrawal on a regular basis. And get really bad headaches.  
  
  But maybe now that she knew, I could explain the whole coffee thing.  
  
  I was curious enough about her death to ask, “Do you know how you died? What happened?”  
  
  According to my family, she’d died in a hippie commune in Madrid at the height of the flower power revolution. Before that, she really had been a world traveler, spending her summers in South America and Europe and her winters in Africa and Australia. And she’d continued that tradition even after her death, traveling far and wide. Passport no longer needed. But no one could really tell me how she died exactly. Or what she did for a living. How she could afford to do all that traveling when she was alive. I knew she’d been married for a while, but my family didn’t know much about her husband. My uncle thought he might’ve been an oil tycoon from Texas, but the family had lost contact, and nobody knew for certain.  
  
  “I’m just not sure,” she said, shaking her head. “I remember we were sitting around a campfire, singing songs and dropping acid—”  
  
  I used every ounce of strength I had to keep the horror I felt from manifesting in my expression.  
  
  “—and Bernie asked me what was wrong, but since Bernie had just done a hit of acid himself, I didn’t take him seriously.”  
  
  I could understand that.  
  
  She looked up at me, her eyes watering with sorrow. “Maybe I should have listened.”  
  
  I put an arm around her slight shoulders. “I’m so sorry, Aunt Lil.”  
  
  “I know, pumpkin head.” She patted my cheek, her hand cool in the absence of flesh and blood. She smiled that lopsided smile of hers, and I suddenly wondered if she’d perhaps dropped one hit too many. “I remember the day you were born.”  
  
  I blinked yet again in surprise. “Really? You were there?”  
  
  “I was. I’m so sorry about your mother.”  
  
  A harsh pang of regret shot through me. I wasn’t expecting it, and it took me a moment to recover. “I—I’m sorry, too.” The memory of my mother’s passing right after I’d been born was not my favorite. And I remembered it so clearly, so precisely. The moment she parted from her physical body, a pop like a rubber band snapping into place ricocheted through my body, and I knew our connection had been severed. I loved her, even then.  
  
  “You were so special,” Aunt Lil said, shaking her head with the memory. “But now that you know I’m a goner, I have to ask, why in tarnation are you so bright?”  
  
  Crap. I couldn’t tell her the truth, that I was the grim reaper and the floodlights came with the gig. She thought I was special, not grim. It just sounded so bad when I said it out loud. I decided to deflect. “Well, that’s kind of a long story, Aunt Lil, but if you want, you can pass through me. You can cross to the other side and be with your family.” I lowered my head, hoping she wouldn’t take me up on my offer. I liked having her around, as selfish as that made me.  
  
  “Are you kidding?” She slapped a knee. “And miss all the crap you get yourself into? Never.” After a disturbing cackle that brought to mind the last horror movie I’d seen, she turned back to the TV. “Now, what’s so groovy about this cookware?”  
  
  I settled in next to her and we watched a whole segment on pans that could take all kinds of abuse, including a bevy of rocks sliding around the nonstick bottom, but since people didn’t actually cook rocks, I wasn’t sure what the point was. Still, the pans were pretty. And I could make low monthly payments. I totally needed them.  
  
  I was on the phone with a healthy-sounding customer service representative named Herman when Cookie walked in. She did that a lot. Walked in. Like she owned the place. Of course, I was in her apartment. Mine was cluttered and depressing, so I’d resorted to loitering in hers.  
  
  Cookie was a large woman with black hair spiked every which way and no sense of fashion whatsoever, if the yellow ensemble she was wearing was any indication. She was also my best friend and receptionist when we had work.  
  
  I waved to her, then spoke into the phone. “Declined? What do you mean declined? I have at least twelve dollars left on that puppy, and you said I could make low monthly payments.”  
  
  Cookie bent over the sofa, grabbed the phone, and pushed the end-call button while completely ignoring the indignant expression I was throwing at her. “It’s not so much declined,” she said, handing the phone back to me, “as canceled.” Then she took the remote and changed the channel to the news. “I’ve put a stop to any new charges on your Home Shopaholic store card—”  
  
  “What?” I thought about acting all flustered and bent out of shape, but I was out of shape enough without purposely adding to the condition. In reality, I was a little in awe of her. “You can do that?”  
  
  The news anchor was talking about the recent rash of bank robberies. He showed surveillance footage of the four-man team, known as the Gentlemen Thieves. They always wore white rubber masks and carried guns, but they never drew them. Not once in the series of eight bank robberies, thus their title.  
  
  I was in the middle of contemplating how familiar they looked when Cookie took hold of my wrist and hefted me off her sofa. “I can do that,” she said as she nudged me toward the door.  
  
  “How?”  
  
  “Simple. I called and pretended to be you.”  
  
  “And they fell for it?” Now I was officially appalled. “Who did you talk to? Did you talk to Herman, because he sounds super cute. Wait.” I screeched to a halt before her. “Are you kicking me out of your apartment?”  
  
  “Not so much kicking you out as putting my foot down. It’s time.”  
  
  “Time?” I asked a little hesitantly.  
  
  “Time.”  
  
  Well, crap. This day was going to suck, I could already tell. “Love the yellow,” I said, becoming petty as she herded me out of her apartment and into mine. “You don’t look like a giant banana at all. And why did you cancel my favorite shopping channel in-store credit card? I only have three.”  
  
  “And they’ve all been canceled. I have to make sure I get paid every week. I’ve also funneled all of your remaining funds out of your bank account and into a secret account in the Cayman Islands.”  
  
  “You can funnel money?”  
  
  “Apparently.”  
  
  “Isn’t that like embezzling?”  
  
  “It’s exactly like embezzling.” After practically shoving me past my threshold, she closed the door behind us and pointed. “I want you to take a look at all this stuff.”  
  
  Admittedly, my apartment was a mess, but I still didn’t know what that had to do with my card. That card was a tool. In the right hands—like, say, mine—it could make dreams come true. I looked around at all the boxes of super-cool stuff I’d ordered: everything from magical scrubbing sponges for the everyday housewife to two-way radios for when the apocalypse hit and cell phones became obsolete. A wall of boxes lined my apartment, ending in a huge mountain of superfluous products in one specific area of the room. Since my apartment was about the size of a Lego, the minute amount that was left was like a broken Lego. A disfigured one that hadn’t survived the invasion of little Lego space aliens.  
  
  And there were more boxes behind the wall of boxes we could actually see. I’d completely lost Mr. Wong. He was a dead guy who lived in the corner of my living room, perpetually hovering with his back to the world. Never moving. Never speaking. And now he was lost to the ecology of commerce. Poor guy. His life couldn’t have been exciting.  
  
  Of course, it didn’t help that I’d also moved out of my offices and brought all my files and office equipment to my apartment. My kitchen, actually, making it completely useless for anything other than file storage. But it had been a necessary move, as my dad had betrayed me in the worst way possible�  
��he’d had me arrested as I lay in a hospital bed after being tortured by a madman—and my offices had been above his bar. I had yet to discover what possessed my own father to have me arrested in such an outlandish and hurtful manner. He’d wanted me out of the PI biz, but his timing and modus operandi needed work.  
  
  Sadly, the bar was only about fifty feet north of my apartment building, so I would have to avoid him when coming and going from my new work digs. But since I hadn’t actually left the apartment building in over two months, that part had been easy. The last time I left was to clear out my offices, and I’d made sure he was out of town when I did so.  
  
  I surveyed all the boxes and decided to turn the tables on Cookie. To play the victim. To blame the whole thing on her. I pointed at an Electrolux and gaped at her. “Who the hell left me unsupervised? This has to be your fault.”  
  
  “Nice try,” she said, completely unmoved. “We’re going to sort through all of this stuff and send back everything except what you’ll actually use. Which is not a lot. Again, I would like to continue collecting a paycheck, if that’s not too much to ask.”  
  
  “Do you take American Express?”  
  
  “Oh, I canceled that, too.”  
  
  I gasped, pretending to be appalled. With a determined set to her shoulders, she led me to my own sofa, took boxes off it, piled them on top of other boxes, then sank down beside me. Her eyes shimmered with warmth and understanding, and I became instantly uncomfortable. “Are we going to have the talk again?”  
  
  “I’m afraid so.”  
  
  “Cook—” I tried to rise and storm off, but she put a hand on my shoulder to stop me “—I’m not sure how else to say that I’m fine.” When she looked down at Margaret, who sat nestled inside my hip holster, my voice took on a defensive edge. “What? Lots of PIs wear guns.”  
  
  “With their pajamas?”  
  
  I snorted. “Yes. Especially if they’re Star Wars pajamas and your gun just happens to resemble a blaster.”  
  
  Margaret was my new best friend. And she’d never funneled money out of my bank account like some other best friends who shall not be named.

Charley, all I’m asking is that you talk to your sister.”  
  
  “I talk to her every day.” I crossed my arms. Suddenly everyone was insisting that I seek counseling when I was fine. So what if I didn’t want to step out of my apartment building? Lots of people liked to stay in. For months at a time.  
  
  “Yes, she calls and tries to talk to you about what happened, about how you’re doing, but you shut her down.”  
  
  “I don’t shut her down. I just change the subject.”  
  
  Cookie got up and made us both a cup of coffee while I stewed in the wonders of denial. After I came to the realization that I liked denial almost as much as mocha lattes, she handed me a cup and I took a sip as she sat next to me again. My eyes rolled back in ecstasy. Her coffee was so much better than Aunt Lil’s.  
  
  “Gemma thinks that maybe you need a hobby.” She looked around at the boxes. “A healthy hobby. Like Pilates. Or alligator wrestling.”  
  
  “I know.” I leaned back and threw an arm over my eyes. “I considered writing my memoirs, but I can’t figure out how to put seventies porn music into prose.”  
  
  “See,” she said, elbowing me. “Writing. That’s a great start. You could try poetry.” She stood and rummaged through my box-covered desk. “Here,” she said, tossing some paper at me. “Write me a poem about how your day is going, and I’ll get started on these boxes.”  
  
  I put the coffee cup aside and sat up. “For real? Couldn’t I just write a poem about my ultimate world domination or the health benefits of eating guacamole?”  
  
  She rose onto her toes to look at me from behind one of my more impressive walls. “You bought two electric pressure cookers? Two?”  
  
  “They were on sale.”  
  
  “Charley,” she said, her tone admonishing. “Wait.” She dipped down then popped back up. “These are awesome.” I knew it. “Can I have one?”  
  
  “Abso-freaking-lutely. I’ll just take it out of your pay.”  
  
  This could work. I could pay her through my Buy From Home purchases, though that might not help her keep her lights on or continue to have running water. But she’d be happy, and wasn’t happiness the most important thing in life? I should write a poem about that.  
  
  “You do realize that to use any of this stuff, you have to actually go to the grocery store.”  
  
  Her words shoved me deeper into the pit of despair often referred to as buyer’s regret. “Isn’t that what Macho Taco express delivery is for?”  
  
  “You’ll have to buy food and spices and crap.”  
  
  “I hate going to the grocery store.”  
  
  “And you’ll have to learn to cook.”  
  
  “Fine,” I said, letting a defeated breath slip through my lips. I had a fantastic flair for the dramatics when needed. “Send back everything that involves any kind of food preparation. I hate to cook.”  
  
  “Do you want to keep the Jackie Kennedy commemorative bracelet?”  
  
  “Do I have to cook it?”  
  
  “Nope.”  
  
  “Then it stays.” I lifted my wrist and twirled the bracelet. “Look how sparkly it is.”  
  
  “And it goes so well with Margaret.”  
  
  “Totally.”  
  
  “Pumpkin butt,” Aunt Lil said.  
  
  I looked up from my Jackie Kennedy commemorative bracelet. Now that she knew she was dead, I would never have to go through that surge of panic at the prospect of her insisting on cooking for me for two weeks straight. I almost starved to death the last time. I held up the bracelet. “Do you think this bracelet is too much?”  
  
  “Jackie goes with anything, dear. But I wanted to talk to you about Cookie.”  
  
  I looked in Cookie’s direction and frowned in disappointment. “What has she done now?”  
  
  Aunt Lil sank down beside me and patted my arm. “I think she should know the truth.”  
  
  “About Jackie Kennedy?”  
  
  “About me.”  
  
  “Oh, right.”  
  
  “What in the world does this monstrous machine do?” Cookie asked from somewhere near the kitchen. A box appeared out of nowhere, hovering unsteadily over a mountain of other boxes.  
  
  I smiled in excitement. “You know how sometimes we order coffee and it comes with that incredible foam on top?”  
  
  “Yeah.”  
  
  “Well, that machine does the magic foam trick.”  
  
  Her dark head popped up. “No.”  
  
  “Yes.”  
  
  She looked at the box lovingly. “Okay, we can keep this. I’ll just have to carve some time out of my schedule to read the instructions.”  
  
  “Don’t you think she should know?” Aunt Lil continued.  
  
  I nodded. She had a point. Or she would have if Cookie didn’t already know. “Cook, can you come here a sec?”  
  
  “Okay, but I’m working out a system. It’s in my head. If I lose it on the way over, I won’t be held accountable.”  
  
  “I can’t make any promises.”  
  
  She sauntered over, shaking another box at me, a disturbing kind of joy in her eyes. “Do you know how long I’ve wanted a salad spinner?”  
  
  “People actually want those?”  
  
  “You don’t?”  
  
  “I think that was one of those four A.M. purchases where I’d lost all sense of reality. I don’t even know why anyone would want to spin a salad.”  
  
  “Well, I do.”  
  
  “Okay, so, I have some bad news.”  
  
  She sat in a chair that catty-cornered the sofa, a wary expression on her face. “You got bad news since you’ve been sitting here?”  
  
  “Kind of.” I tilted my head discreetly to my side, indicating a presence.  
  
  Cookie frowned.  
  
  I did it again.  
  
  She shrugged in confusion.  
  
  With a sigh, I said, “I have news about Aunt Lillian.”  
  
  “Oh. Oh!” She looked around and questioned me with a quirk of her brows.  
  
  I gave a quick shake of my head. Normally, Cookie would play along, pretending she could see Aunt Lil as well, but since Aunt Lil had finally caught on to the fact that she could walk through walls, I didn’t think that would be appropriate. I put a hand on hers and said, “Aunt Lil has passed away.”  
  
  Cookie frowned.  
  
  “She’s gone.”  
  
  She shrugged in confusion. Again.  
  
  “I knew she’d take it hard,” Aunt Lil said by my side. She sniffled into her sleeve again.  
  
  I wanted so badly to roll my eyes at Cookie. She was not getting my hints. I’d have to try harder. “But you know how I can see the departed?”  
  
  A dawning emerged on Cook’s face as she realized Aunt Lil had caught on at long last.  
  
  I patted her hand. Really hard. “She’s here with us now, just not as you will remember her.”  
  
  “You mean—?”  
  
  “Yes,” I said, interrupting before she could give anything away. “She has passed.”  
  
  Cookie finally grasped the entire concept. Not just a little corner of it. She threw a hand over her mouth. A weak squeak slipped through her fingers. “Not Aunt Lil.” She doubled over and let sobs rack her shoulders.  
  
  Subtle.  
  
  “I didn’t think she’d take it this hard,” Aunt Lil said.  
  
  “Neither did I.” I looked on in horror as Cookie acted out that scene from The Godfather. It was even more eerie from this close proximity. “It’s okay,” I said, patting her head. Really hard. She glared through her fingers. “Aunt Lil is with us incorporeally. She sends her love.”  
  
  “Oh, yes,” Aunt Lil said with a delirious nod. “Send her my love.”  
  
  “Aunt Lil,” Cookie said, straightening and looking beside me. Only on the wrong side.  
  
  I nodded in Aunt Lil’s direction again, and Cookie corrected her line of sight.  
  
  “Aunt Lil, I’m so sorry. We’ll miss you so much.”  
  
  “Aw, isn’t she the sweetest thing? I always liked her.”  
  
  With a smile, I took Aunt Lil’s hand into mine. “I always liked her, too. Until about fifteen minutes ago.”  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  I decided a shower was not out of  
the question and hopped in as Cookie took inventory and Aunt Lil decided to see what Africa looked like from her new perspective. I wondered if she’d ever figure out how long she’d been dead. I certainly wasn’t going to tell her.  
  
  Hot water was one of the best therapies in the world. It washed away stress and soothed nerves. But Rottweilers were even better. Ever since a gorgeous Rottie by the name of Artemis had died and become my guardian—against what, I had no idea—I found my showers more challenging than usual. Mostly because Artemis loved showers, too. She didn’t come around that often, but the minute I turned on the water, there she was.  
  
  “Hey, precious,” I said as she tried to catch a stream of water in her mouth.  
  
  She barked playfully, the loud yelp echoing off the walls of the tub. I reached down and rubbed her ears. The water ran straight through her, so she was dry to the touch, but she tried so hard to catch the thick droplets on her tongue.  
  
  “I know how you feel, girl. Sometimes the things we want most seem completely out of our reach.”  
  
  When she jumped up on me, her stubby tail wagging with delight, her weight sent me crashing against the tile wall. I clutched on to the showerhead to keep my balance, then let her lick my neck before another stream of water captured her attention. She dived for it, almost knocking my feet out from under me. I totally needed a shower mat. And shaving my legs with a Rottweiler chasing every splash of water known to man was like taking my life into my own hands, but it had to be done.  
  
  After semi-successfully shaving my legs with minimal blood loss, I turned off the water and nuzzled her to me. She licked my left ear, her front teeth scraping the lobe and causing goose bumps to spread over my skin, and I laughed out loud. “Oh, thank you. I needed that ear cleaned. Thank you so much.”  
  
  With another yelp, she realized fun time was over. The wonderful world of waterworks had stopped, so she dived through the exterior wall and disappeared. I wondered if it was wrong that I took showers with a dog.  
  
  I dried my hair and pulled it into something that resembled a ponytail, dressed in jeans and a white pullover with a zippered collar, then inspected myself in the mirror. No idea why. I’d only change back into my pajamas in a couple of hours anyway. Why did I get dressed? Why did I bother? Why did I shower, for that matter?  
  
  I pumped a dollop of lotion onto my palm and rubbed my hands together as I examined the nasty scar on my cheek. It was almost gone. On anyone else, it would have remained a constant reminder of events better left forgotten. But being the grim reaper had its benefits. Namely, quick healing and minimal scarring. Nary a shred of visible evidence to support the reasoning behind my sudden case of mild agoraphobia. I was so stupid.  
  
  I took the lotion I’d been rubbing into my hands and smeared it across the mirror. White streaks distorted my face. A definite improvement.  
  
  Growing more annoyed with myself by the second, I strolled to the window to see if my traitorous father was at work yet. He seemed to be coming in later and later. Not that I cared. Any man who would have his own daughter arrested while she lay dying in a hospital bed after being tortured almost to death didn’t deserve my concern. I was just curious, and curious was way on the other side of concern. But instead of seeing my father’s tan SUV, I caught sight of one Mr. Reyes Farrow, and my breath stilled in my chest. He was leaning against the back of Dad’s bar, arms folded at his chest, one booted foot leveraged against the building.  
  
  And he was out.  
  
  I knew he would be, but I had yet to see him. He’d been in prison for ten years for a crime he didn’t commit. The cops caught on when the guy he’d supposedly killed tied me up and tortured me. I was glad he’d been freed, but to get there, Reyes’d used me as bait, so we were once again at an impasse. I was mad at him for using me as bait. He was mad at me for being mad at him for using me as bait. Our relationship seemed to hinge on these impasses, but that’s what I got for falling in lust with the son of Satan. If only he weren’t so deliciously and dangerously hot. I had such a thing for bad boys.  
  
  And this particular bad boy had been dipped in a lake of beauty when he was born. His arms corded with muscles across a wide chest; his full mouth, too sensual for my peace of mind, sat in a grim, moody line; his dark hair, forever in need of a trim, curled at his neck and tumbled over his forehead. And I could just make out his thick lashes as they fanned across his cheeks.  
  
  A man walked past him and waved. Reyes nodded, but then he must have felt me watching him. He looked down in thought then up directly at me. His angry gaze locked on to mine, held it for a long, breathless moment, and then slowly, with deliberate purpose, he dematerialized, his body transforming into smoke and dust until there was nothing left of it.  
  
  He could do that. He could separate from his physical body, and his incorporeal essence—something I could see as easily as I saw the departed—could go anywhere in the world it wanted to. That didn’t surprise me in the least. What surprised me was the fact that, while incorporeal, no one else could see him. But that man had waved. He’d seen Reyes standing there and waved. That meant his physical body had been leaning against that brick wall.  
  
  That meant his physical body had dematerialized, had vanished into the cool morning air.  
  
  Impossible.  
  
  2  
  
  Doing nothing is hard.  
  
  You never know when you’re done.  
  
  —T-SHIRT  
  
  It took every ounce of strength I had to tear myself away from the window, wondering if Reyes Farrow had just dematerialized his human body. Then another thought hit: What the hell was he doing out there? And then another: Why was he so angry? It was my turn to be angry. He had no reason to be. And I would have told him that very thing if I’d felt any incentive to leave my apartment and hunt him down. But my apartment was cozy. The thought of leaving it just to get in a fight with the son of evil incarnate made about as much sense as flying ants. Where was the logic in that? Ants were scary enough without giving them the ability to fly.  
  
  I walked into my living room, shaken and disoriented. “Reyes Farrow was outside. Just leaning against the bar. Watching the apartment.”  
  
  Cookie jumped up. She gaped at me for about ten seconds before hurdling the couch and stumbling into my bedroom, nearly crashing through the window. She was almost agile where men were concerned. I didn’t have the heart to tell her she’d have had a better view from the living room, from pretty much right where she’d been sitting. Nor did I have the heart to tell her that he was already gone.  
  
  “He’s not there,” she said, her voice agitated and panicked.  
  
  “What?” I asked, pretending to be surprised. I hurried over and peeked out the curtains. Sure enough, he was gone. “He was there a minute ago.” I scanned the entire area.  
  
  She frowned at me. “You knew he was gone.”  
  
  I cringed, ashamed. “Sorry. You were just so into your gymnastics routine, I didn’t want to break your concentration. Do you know how hard it would be to explain to the cops if you’d crashed through the window and plummeted to your death?” I refocused on the spot where Reyes had been standing. “But I swear, if that man is tailing me—”  
  
  “Hon, you have to go somewhere to be tailed. This would be more like stalking.”  
  
  She had a point. One that I could throw in his face if I were ever going to speak to him again.  
  
  I bowed my head as Cookie continued to search the parking lot in the hopes that he would show up again. I could hardly blame her.  
  
  “While we’re on the subject, I think he dematerialized his human body.”  
  
  She jumped in surprise. “I thought that was impossible. Are you sure?”  
  
  “No.” I walked back into my cluttered living room, because another thought hit. Freaking ADD. “So, be honest. How broke am I?”  
  
  Cookie drew in a deep breath and followed me. She regarded me with a sad expression before answering. “On a scale of one to ten, you’re not on it. You’re more like a negative twelve.”  
  
  “Crap.” I studied my Jackie Kennedy commem  
orative bracelet with a great and terrible weight on my chest, then opened the clasp. “Here, send this back, too.”  
  
  She took it. “Are you sure?”  
  
  “Yeah. I was only pretending it went well with Margaret, anyway. Now, if it were black with skulls on it…”  
  
  “Sadly, I don’t think Jackie wore skulls all that often. You know, we still have a couple of clients who owe us.”  
  
  “Really?” This was promising. I wound around boxes to Mr. Coffee. He was the only action I’d been getting lately.  
  
  “Yep.”  
  
  When she hesitated, I knew something was up. I refreshed my cup and questioned her with a quirk of my brows. “Like who?”  
  
  “Like Mrs. Allen.”  
  
  “Mrs. Allen?” I stirred in creamer and fake sweet stuff. “She pays me in cookies. I’m not sure how that will help with the bills.”  
  
  “True, but she didn’t pay us the last time you found PP.”  
  
  PP, otherwise known as Prince Phillip, was Mrs. Allen’s rabid poodle. She should have called him Houdini. That dog could escape a locked bank vault. But actually, Cookie was wrong. Guilt had me biting my lip as I stirred, averting my gaze.  
  
  She gasped. “Mrs. Allen paid you?”  
  
  “Kind of.”  
  
  “And you didn’t share?”  
  
  “Well—”  
  
  “An entire plate of cookies, and you didn’t share? After I did all the legwork?”  
  
  My jaw fell open. “The legwork? You walked over to the window and spotted him by the Dumpster.”  
  
  “Yes, and I walked—” She crisscrossed her fingers to demonstrate a walking motion, which I found humorous. “—to the window with my legs.”  
  
  “Yes, but I was the one who chased that vicious little shit seventeen blocks.”  
  
  “Three.”  
  
  “And then he bit me.”  
  
  “He has no teeth.”  
  
  “Gums hurt, too.” I rubbed my arm absently, remembering the horror of it all.  
  
  “He’s a poodle. How hard can he gum?”  
  
  “Fine, next time you can chase him down.”  
  
  After exhaling loudly, she said, “What about that Billy Bob guy? He still owes us money.”

Coincidentally I came across an article recently which talked about the ""Gen Z Stare"" which described exactly what I had been noticing, making me realise it might be more common than just an observational bias I had (which still might be the case).

There was a graduate team I hired where they were all perfectly smart young people. However from the moment I met them nearly every every time I spoke to them, it was like they just had this blank expression on their faces. Then I started to notice it more, when meeting through friends, or in shops, pubs, coffee shops.

I totally get it when the person is a teenager, but in 20-somethings it strikes me as bizarre. It was definitely not something I saw often in other people my age when I was in my twenties (although it existed). It could also be that I'm older (millennial) and they interact with me differently, but at a distance I've noticed the same while they interact with others closer in age.

Has anyone else noticed this same kind of behaviour? It made me wonder if it was related to difference in upbringing, maybe online culture which existed to a lesser extent as I was growing up, or more recent times where we were all locked up in our homes meaning social interaction suffered.",68,1753119437.0,AskUK,112,0.69,False

  My father always said the way to learn the job you want is to spend every second watching someone do it.  
  
  “To get the job at the top, you’ve got to start at the bottom,” he told me. “Become the person the CEO can’t live without. Be their right-hand man. Learn their world, and they’ll snatch you up the second you finish your degree.”  
  
  I had become irreplaceable. And I’d definitely become the Right Hand. It just so happened that in this case, I was the right hand that most days wanted to slap the damn face.  
  
  My boss, Mr. Bennett Ryan. Beautiful Bastard.  
  
  My stomach clenched tightly at the thought of him: tall, gorgeous, and entirely evil. He was the most self-righteous, pompous prick I’d ever met. I’d hear all of the other women in the office gossip about his escapades and wonder if a nice face was all it took. But my father also said, “You realize early in life that beauty is only skin-deep, and ugly goes straight to the bone.” I’d had my fair share of unpleasant men in the past few years, dated a few in high school and college. But this one took the cake.  
  
  “Well, hello Miss Mills!” Mr. Ryan stood in the doorway to my office that served as an anteroom to his. His voice was laced with honey, but it was all wrong . . . like honey left to freeze and crack on ice.  
  
  After spilling water on my phone, dropping my earrings into the garbage disposal, being rear-ended on the interstate, and having to wait for the cops to come and tell us what we both already knew—that it was the other guy’s fault—the last thing I needed this morning was a grumpy Mr. Ryan.  
  
  Too bad for me he didn’t come in any other flavor.  
  
  I gave him my usual. “Good morning, Mr. Ryan,” hoping he would give me his usual curt nod in return.  
  
  But when I tried to slip past him, he murmured, “Indeed? ‘Morning,’ Miss Mills? What time is it in your little world?”  
  
  I stopped and met his cold stare. He was a good eight inches taller than me, and before working for him I’d never felt so small. I’d worked for Ryan Media Group for six years. But since his return to the family business nine months ago, I’d taken to wearing heels I used to consider circus height just so I could approach him near eye level. Even so, I still had to tilt my head to look up at him, and he clearly relished it, hazel eyes flashing.  
  
  “I had a bit of a disaster morning. It won’t happen again,” I said, relieved that my voice came out steady. I had never been late, not once, but leave it to him to make a thing of it the first time it happened. I managed to slip past him, put my purse and coat in my closet, and power up my computer. I tried to act like he wasn’t standing in the doorway, watching every move I made.  
  
  “‘Disaster morning’ is quite an apt description for what I’ve had to deal with in your absence. I spoke to Alex Schaffer personally to smooth over the fact that he didn’t get the signed contracts when promised: nine a.m., East Coast time. I had to call Madeline Beaumont personally to let her know we were, in fact, going to proceed with the proposal as written. In other words, I’ve done your job and mine this morning. Surely, even with a ‘disaster morning’ you can manage eight a.m.? Some of us get up and start working before the brunch hour.”  
  
  I glanced up at him, antagonizing me, glaring, arms crossed over his broad chest—and all because I was an hour late. I blinked away, very deliberately not staring at the way his dark tailored suit stretched across his shoulders. I had made the mistake of visiting the hotel gym during a convention the first month we worked together and walked in to find him sweaty and shirtless next to the treadmill. He had a face that any male model would kill for and the most incredible hair I’ve ever seen on a man. Freshly fucked hair. That’s what the girls downstairs called it, and according to them, it earned its title. The image of him wiping his chest with his shirt was forever burned into my brain.  
  
  Of course, he’d had to ruin it by opening his mouth: “It’s nice to see you finally taking an interest in your physical fitness, Miss Mills.”  
  
  Asshole.  
  
  “I’m sorry, Mr. Ryan,” I said with just a hint of bite. “I understand the burden I placed on you by making you manage a fax machine and pick up a telephone. As I mentioned, it won’t happen again.”  
  
  “You’re right, it won’t,” he replied, cocky smile firmly in place.  
  
  If only he would keep his mouth shut, he’d be perfect. A piece of duct tape would do the trick. I had some in my desk that I’d occasionally pull out and fondle, hoping someday I could put it to good use.  
  
  “And just so you don’t allow this incident to slip your memory, I’d like to see the full status tables for the Schaffer, Colton, and Beaumont projects on my desk by five. And then you’re going to make up the hour lost this morning by doing a mock board presentation of the Papadakis account for me in the conference room at six. If you’re going to manage this account, you’re going to prove to me that you know what the hell you’re doing.”  
  
  My eyes widened as I watched him turn  
away, slamming his office door behind him. He knew damn well that I was ahead of schedule with this project, which also served as my MBA thesis. I still had months to finish my slides once the contracts were signed . . . which they weren’t—they hadn’t even been fully drafted. Now, with everything else on my plate, he wanted me to put together a mock board presentation in . . . I looked at my watch. Great, seven and a half hours, if I skipped lunch. I opened the Papadakis file and got down to it.  
  
  As everyone began filtering out for lunch, I remained glued to my desk with my coffee and a bag of trail mix I’d bought from the vending machine. Normally I’d bring leftovers or leave with the other interns to grab something, but time was not on my side today. I heard the outer office door open and looked up, smiling as Sara Dillon walked in. Sara was in the same MBA internship program at Ryan Media Group that I was, though she worked in accounting.  
  
  “Ready for lunch?” she asked.  
  
  “I’m going to have to skip it. This is the day from hell.” I looked at her apologetically, and her smile turned into a smirk.  
  
  “Day from hell, or boss from hell?” She took a seat on the edge of my desk. “I heard he was on a bit of a rampage this morning.”  
  
  I gave her a knowing look. Sara didn’t work for him, but she knew all about Bennett Ryan. As the youngest son of company founder Elliott Ryan, and with a notoriously short fuse, he was a living legend in the building. “Even if there were two of me, I wouldn’t be able to get this finished in time.”  
  
  “You sure you don’t want me to bring you back something?” Her eyes moved in the direction of his office. “A hit man? Some holy water?”  
  
  I laughed. “I’m good.”  
  
  Sara smiled and left the office. I’d just finished off the last of my coffee when I bent down, noting a run in my stockings. “And on top of everything else,” I began, hearing Sara return, “I’ve already snagged these. Actually, if you’re going somewhere there’s chocolate, bring me back fifty pounds, so I can eat my feelings later.”  
  
  I glanced up and saw that it wasn’t Sara standing there. My cheeks flushed red and I pulled my skirt back down.  
  
  “I’m sorry, Mr. Ryan, I—”  
  
  “Miss Mills, since you and the other office girls have plenty of time to discuss problematic lingerie, in addition to putting together the Papadakis presentation, I need you to also run down to the Willis office and retrieve the market analysis and segmentation for Beaumont.” He straightened his tie, looking at his reflection in my window. “Do you think you can manage that?”  
  
  Did he just call me an “office girl”? Sure, as part of my internship I often did some basic assistant work for him, but he knew damn well I had worked for this company for years before receiving a JT Miller scholarship to Northwestern. I was four months away from getting my business degree.  
  
  Getting my degree and getting the hell out from under you, I thought. I looked up to meet his blazing eyes. “I’ll be happy to ask Sam if she—”  
  
  “It wasn’t a suggestion,” he cut me off. “I’d like you to pick them up.” He gazed at me for a moment with a clenched jaw before turning on his heel and storming back to his office, pulling the door closed roughly behind him.  
  
  What the fuck was his problem? Was slamming doors like a teenager really necessary? I grabbed my blazer from the back of the chair and began making my way to our satellite office a few buildings down.  
  
  When I returned, I knocked on his door but there was no response. I tried the knob. Locked. He was probably having a late-afternoon quickie with some trust fund princess while I ran around Chicago like an insane person. I shoved the manila folder through the mail slot, hoping the papers scattered everywhere and he’d have to get down and sort them himself. Would serve him right. I rather liked the image of him on his knees on the floor, gathering scattered documents. Then again, knowing him, he would call me into that sterile hellhole to clean it up while he watched.  
  
  Four hours later I had the status updates complete, my slides mostly in order, and I was almost hysterically laughing with how awful this day was. I found myself plotting a very bloody and drawn-out murder of the kid at The Copy Stop. A simple job, that’s all I had asked. Make some copies, bind some things. Should have been a piece of cake. In and out. But no. It had taken two hours.  
  
  I raced down the darkened hall of the now-empty building, the presentation materials clutched haphazardly in my arms, and glanced at my watch. Six twenty. Mr. Ryan was going to have my ass. I was twenty minutes late. As I experienced this morning, he hated late. “Late” was a word not found in the Bennett Ryan Dickhead Dictionary. Along with “heart,” “kindness,” “compassion,” “lunch break,” or “thank you.”  
  
  So there I was, running through the empty halls in my stilt-like Italian pumps, racing to the executioner.  
  
  Breathe, Chloe. He can smell fear.  
  
  As I neared the conference room, I tried to calm my breathing and slowed to a walk. Soft light shone from beneath the closed door. He was definitely in there, waiting for me. Carefully, I attempted to smooth my hair and clothing while tidying the bundle of documents in my arms. Taking a deep breath, I knocked on the door.  
  
  “Come in.”  
  
  I walked into the warmly lit space. The conference room was huge; one wall was filled with floor-to-ceiling windows that gave a beautiful view of the Chicago cityscape from eighteen stories up. Dusk darkened the sky outside, and skyscrapers speckled the horizon with their lighted windows. In the center of the room stood a large heavy wood conference table, and facing me from the head of the table was Mr. Ryan.  
  
  He sat there, suit jacket hanging on the chair behind him, tie loosened, crisp white shirtsleeves rolled up to his elbows, and chin resting on his steepled fingers. His eyes were boring into mine, but he said nothing.  
  
  “I apologize, Mr. Ryan,” I said, my voice wavering with my still labored breathing, “The print job took—” I stopped. Excuses wouldn’t help my situation. And besides, I wasn’t going to let him blame me for something I had no control over. He could kiss my ass. With my newfound bravery in place, I lifted my chin and walked over to where he sat.  
  
  Without meeting his gaze, I sorted through my papers and placed a copy of the presentation on the table before us. “Are you ready for me to begin?”  
  
  He didn’t respond aloud, his eyes piercing my brave front. This would be a lot easier if he wasn’t so gorgeous. Instead, he gestured toward the materials before him, urging me to continue.  
  
  I cleared my throat and began my presentation. As I moved through the different aspects of the proposal, he stayed silent, staring directly at his copy. Why was he so calm? His temper tantrums I could handle. But the eerie silence? It was unnerving.  
  
  I was leaning over the table, gesturing toward a set of graphs, when it happened.  
  
  “Their timeline for the first milestone is a little ambi—” I stopped midsentence, my breath caught in my throat. His hand pressed gently into my lower back before sliding down, settling on the curve of my ass. In the nine months I had worked for him, he had never intentionally touched me.  
  
  This was most definitely intentional.  
  
  The heat from his hand burned through my skirt and into my skin. Every muscle in my body tensed, and it felt like my insides were liquefying. What the hell was he doing? My brain screamed at me to push his hand off, to tell him to never touch me again, but my body had other ideas. My nipples hardened, and I clenched my jaw in response. Traitor nipples.  
  
  While my heart pounded in my chest, at least half a minute passed, and neither of us said anything as his hand moved down to my thigh, caressing. Our breathing and the muted noise of the city below were the only sounds in the still air of the conference room.  
  
  “Turn around, Miss Mills.” His quiet voice broke the silence and I straightened my back, eyes facing forward. Slowly I turned, his hand skimming across me and sliding to my hip. I could feel the way his hand spread from his fingertips  
on my lower back all the way to where his thumb pressed against the soft skin just in front of my hipbone. I looked down to meet his eyes, which looked intently back at me.  
  
  I could see his chest rising and falling, each breath deeper than the last. A muscle twitched in his sharp jaw as his thumb began to move, slowly sliding back and forth, his eyes never leaving mine. He was waiting for me to stop him; there had been plenty of time for me to shove him away, or simply turn and leave. But I had too many feelings to sort out before I could react. I had never felt this way, and I had never expected to feel this about him. I wanted to slap him, and then pull him up by his shirt and lick his neck.  
  
  “What are you thinking?” he whispered, eyes somehow both mocking and anxious.  
  
  “I’m still trying to figure that out.”  
  
  With those eyes still locked to mine, he began to slide his hand lower. His fingers ran down my thigh, to the hem of my skirt. He moved it up so his fingertips traced the strap of my garter belt, the lace edge of one thigh-high stocking. A long finger slipped beneath the thin fabric and pulled it down slightly. I sucked in a sharp breath, feeling suddenly like I was melting from the outside in.  
  
  How could I let my body react like this? I still wanted to slap him, but now, more than that, I wanted him to keep going. The heavy ache between my legs was building. He reached the edge of my panties and slipped his fingers under the fabric. I felt him slide against my skin and graze my clit before pushing his finger inside me, and I bit my lip trying, unsuccessfully, to stifle my groan. When I looked down at him, beads of sweat were forming on his brow.  
  
  “Fuck,” he growled quietly. “You’re wet.” His eyes fell closed and he seemed to be waging the same internal battle I was. I glanced down at his lap and could see him straining against the smooth fabric of his pants. Without opening his eyes, he withdrew his finger and fisted the thin lace of my panties in his hand. He was shaking as he looked up at me, fury clear in his expression. In one quick movement he tore them off, the rip of the fabric echoing in the silence.  
 He pulled my hips roughly, lifting me up onto the cold table and spreading my legs in front of him. I gave an involuntary groan as his fingers returned, sliding between my legs and pushing into me again. I despised this man in a singularly sharp way, but my body was betraying me; I craved more of what he was doing. Damn if he wasn’t good at this. His weren’t the gentle loving touches I was accustomed to. Here was a man used to getting what he wanted, and it turned out that right now, what he wanted was me. My head fell to the side as I leaned back on my elbows, feeling my impending orgasm approaching fast.  
  
  To my absolute horror I actually whimpered, “Oh, please.”  
  
  He stopped moving, pulling his fingers back and holding them in a fist before him. I sat up, grabbing his silk tie and pulling his mouth roughly against mine. His lips felt as perfect as they looked, firm and smooth. I’d never been kissed by someone who clearly knew every single angle and dip and teasing move to make me almost completely lose my mind.  
  
  I bit his lower lip as my hands made quick work down to the front of his pants, whipping his belt free of the loops. “You better be ready to finish what you started.”  
  
  He made a low, angry noise deep in his throat and took my blouse in his hands, ripping it open, the silver buttons skittering across the long conference table.  
  
  He slid his hands up my ribs and over my breasts, thumbs slipping back and forth across my taut nipples, his dark stare fixated on my expression the entire time. His hands were big, and rough almost to the point of pain, but instead of wincing or backing off, I pushed into his palms wanting more, and harder.  
  
  He growled, fingers tightening. It occurred to me I might bruise, and for a sick moment I hoped I did. I wanted a way to remember this feeling, of being completely sure of what my body wanted, entirely unleashed.  
  
  He leaned close enough to bite my shoulder, whispering, “You fucking tease.”  
  
  Unable to get close enough, I quickened my pace on his zipper, shoving his pants and his boxers to the floor. I gave his cock a hard squeeze, feeling him pulse against my palm.  
  
  The way he hissed my last name—“Mills”—should have sent a rush of fury through me, but I only felt one thing right now: pure, unadulterated lust. He forced my skirt up my thighs and pushed me back on the conference table. Before I could utter a single word, he took hold of my ankles, grabbed his cock, and took a step forward, thrusting deep inside me.  
  
  I couldn’t even be horrified by the loud moan I let out—he felt better than anything.  
  
  “What’s that?” he hissed through clenched teeth, his hips slapping against my thighs, driving him deep inside. “Never been fucked like this before, have you? You wouldn’t be such a tease if you were being properly fucked.”  
  
  Who did he think he was? And why the hell did it turn me on so much that he was right? I had never had sex anywhere but on a bed, and it never felt like this.  
  
  “I’ve had better,” I taunted.  
  
  He laughed, a quiet mocking sound. “Look at me.”  
  
  “No.”  
  
  He pulled out just as I was about to come. At first I thought he was actually going to leave me this way, until he grabbed my arms and yanked me up off the table, lips and tongue pressing against mine.  
  
  “Look at me,” he said again. And, finally, with him no longer inside me, I could. He blinked once, slowly, long dark lashes brushing against his cheek, and then said, “Ask me to make you come.”  
  
  His tone was all wrong. It was almost a question, but his words were just like him—all bastard. I did want him to make me come. More than anything. But I’d be damned if I’d ever ask him for anything.  
  
  I dropped my voice and stared back at him. “You’re an asshole, Mr. Ryan.”  
  
  His smile told me that whatever he’d needed from me, he got. I wanted to slam my knees up into his balls, but then I wouldn’t get more of what I really wanted.  
  
  “Say please, Miss Mills.”  
  
  “Please, go fuck yourself.”  
  
  The next thing I felt was the cold window against my breasts, and I groaned at the intense contrast in temperature between it and his skin. I was on fire; every part of me wanted to feel his rough touch.  
  
  “At least you’re consistent,” he snarled into my ear before biting my shoulder. He kicked at my feet. “Spread your legs.”  
  
  I parted my legs and without hesitation he pulled my hips back and reached between us before thrusting forward into me.  
  
  “You like the cold?”  
  
  “Yes.”  
  
  “Devious, filthy girl. You like being watched, don’t you?” he murmured, taking my earlobe between his teeth. “You love that all of Chicago can look up here and see you getting fucked, and you loving every minute of it with your pretty tits pressed against the glass.”  
  
  “Stop talking, you’re ruining it.” Though he wasn’t. Not even close. His gravelly voice was doing wicked things to me.  
  
  But he just laughed in my ear and probably noticed the way I shivered at the sound. “You want them to see you come?”  
  
  I groaned in response, unable to form words with each repeated thrust into me, pressing me further against the glass.  
  
  “Say it. You want to come, Miss Mills? Answer me or I’ll stop and make you suck me off instead,” he hissed, driving himself deeper and deeper inside me with every thrust.  
  
  The part of me that hated him was dissolving like sugar on my tongue, and the part that wanted everything he had to give me was growing, hot and demanding.  
  
  “Just tell me.” He leaned forward, sucked my earlobe between his lips and then gave it a sharp bite. “I promise I’ll give it to you.”  
  
  “Please,” I said, closing my eyes to shut out everything else and just feel him. “Please. Yes.”  
  
  He reached around, moving his fingertips across my clit with the perfect pressure, the perfect rhythm. I could feel his smile press into the back of my neck, and when he opened his mouth and pressed his teeth to my skin, I was done for. Warmth spread down my spine, around my hips, and between my legs, jerking me back into him. My hands slammed against the glass, my entire body quaking from the orgasm that was rushing over me, leaving me gasping for air. When it finally subsided, he pulled out and spun me around to face him, ducking his head to suck my neck, my jaw, my lower lip.  
  
  “Say thank you,” he whispered.  
  
  I dug my hands into his hair and tugged hard, hoping I could get some reaction out of him, wanting to see if he was in control or delusional. What are we doing?  
  
  He groaned, leaning into my hands and kissing up and down my neck, pressing his erection into my stomach. “Now make me feel good.”  
  
  I released one hand and brought it down to his cock and began stroking him. He was heavy, and long, and perfect in my palm. I wanted to tell him, but I’d be damned if I ever let him know how amazing he felt. Instead, I pulled away from his lips, staring at him with hooded eyes.  
  
  “I’m going to make you come so hard you forget that you’re supposed to be the world’s biggest asshole,” I growled, sliding down the glass before slowly taking his entire cock in my mouth and back against my throat. He tensed and let out a deep moan. I looked up at him, his palms and forehead resting on the glass, his eyes closed tight. He looked vulnerable, and he looked gorgeous in his abandon.  
  
  But he wasn’t vulnerable. He was the biggest jerk on the planet and I was on my knees in front of him. No fucking way.  
  
  So instead of giving him what I knew he wanted, I stood up, pulled my skirt back down, and met his eyes. It was easier now, without him touching me and making me feel things he had no business doing.  
  
  The seconds ticked by, neither of us looking away.  
  
  “What the fuck do you think you’re doing?” he rasped. “Get on your knees and open your mouth.”  
  
  “Not a chance.”  
  
  I pulled the front of my buttonless shirt together and walked out, praying my shaky legs wouldn’t betray me. />  
  Grabbing my purse from my desk, I threw my blazer on, trying desperately to fasten the button with my trembling fingers. Mr. Ryan still hadn’t come out, and I ran to the elevator praying to God it would get there before I had to face him again.  
  
  I couldn’t even let myself think about what happened until I was out of there. I’d let him fuck me, give me the most amazing orgasm of my life, and then I’d left him with his pants around his ankles in the company conference room with the worst case of blue balls known to any man. If this was someone else’s life I would be high-fiving them so hard. Too bad it wasn’t.  
  
  Shit.  
  
  The doors opened and I entered, quickly pushing the button and watching as each floor counted down. As soon as the elevator reached the lobby I raced out and down the hall. I briefly heard the security guard say something about working late, but I just waved and sped past him.  
  
  With each step the ache between my legs reminded me of the events of the last hour. As I reached my car I unlocked it with the remote, pulled open the door, and collapsed into the safety of the leather seats. I looked up at myself in the rearview mirror.  
  
  What in the fuck was that?  
  
  Two  
  
  Christ. I am so fucking screwed.  
  
  I’d been staring at my ceiling since I woke up thirty minutes ago. Brain: a mess. Dick: hard.  
  
  Well, hard again.  
  
  I scowled at the ceiling. It didn’t matter how many times I’d jerked off after she left me last night, it never seemed to go away. And though I didn’t think it was possible, it was worse than the hundreds of other times I’d woken up this way. Because this time, I knew what I was missing. And she hadn’t even let me come.  
  
  Nine months. Nine fucking months of morning wood, jacking off, and endless fantasies about someone I didn’t even want. Well, that wasn’t completely true. I wanted her. I wanted her more than any woman I’d ever seen. The big problem was I also hated her.  
  
  And she hated me too. I mean, she really hated me. In all my thirty-one years, I had never met someone who pushed my buttons like Miss Mills.  
  
  Just her name made my dick twitch. Fucking traitor. I stared down at where I tented my sheets. This stupid appendage got me into this mess to begin with. I rubbed my hands across my face and sat up.  
  
  Why couldn’t I just keep it in my pants? I’d managed for almost a year. And it had worked. I kept my distance, bossed her around, hell, even I’ll admit I’d been a bastard. And then I just lost it. All it took was one moment, sitting in that quiet room, her smell all around me and that fucking skirt, her ass in my face. I snapped.  
  
  I was sure that if I just had her once, it would be disappointing and the wanting would be over. I’d finally have some peace. But here I was, in my bed, hard, as if I hadn’t come in weeks. I looked at the clock, and it had only been four hours.  
  
  I took a quick shower, scrubbing myself roughly as if to remove any trace of her left from last night. This was going to stop, this had to stop. Bennett Ryan didn’t act like some horny teenager, and I certainly did not fuck around in my office. The last thing I needed was a clingy woman ruining everything. I couldn’t allow Miss Mills to have this control over me.  
  
  Everything was so much better before I knew what I was missing. For as awful as that was, this was million times worse.  
  
  I was making my way into my office when she walked in. The way she left last night, practically sprinting out the door, I figured one of two scenarios awaited me. Either she would be making eyes at me, thinking that last night meant something, that we meant something. Or she’d have my ass.  
  
  If word got out about what we’d done, not only could I lose my job, but I could lose everything I’d worked for. And yet, as much as I hated her, I couldn’t see her doing something like that. If there was one thing I’d learned about her, it was that she was trustworthy and loyal. She might be a hateful shrew, but I didn’t think she would throw me to the lions. She had worked for Ryan Media Group since college and was a valued part of the company for a reason. Now she was only months from obtaining her MBA and would have her pick of jobs when she was ready. No way would she jeopardize that.  
  
  But I’ll be damned if she didn’t completely ignore me. She walked in wearing a knee-length trench coat. It shielded whatever was beneath, but did a fantastic job showing off those amazing legs.  
  
  Oh shit . . . if she was wearing those shoes, there was a good chance . . . No, not that dress. Please, for the love of God, not that dress. I knew for a fact there was no way I had the willpower for that shit today.  
  
  I glared at her as she hung her jacket in her closet and sat down at her desk.  
  
  Well, fuck me running, that woman really was the biggest tease in the entire world.  
  
  It was the white dress. With a neckline that dipped down to accentuate the soft smooth skin of her neck and collarbone, and white fabric clinging perfectly to those gorgeous tits, the dress was the bane of my existence, my heaven and hell wrapped in one delicious package.  
  
  The hem fell just below her knees and it was the sexiest thing I had ever seen. It wasn’t provocative in any way, but there was something about the cut and that goddamn virginal white that had me hard practically all day. And she always left her hair down when she wore it. One of my recurring fantasies was of taking all of the damned pins out of her hair before I grabbed a handful and fucked her.  
  
  God, she pissed me off.  
  
  When she still didn’t acknowledge me, I turned and stormed into my office, slamming the door behind me. Why was she still affecting me this way? I’d never had anyone or anything distract me from work, and I hated her for being the first.  
  
  But part of me relished the memory of her victorious expression as she turned and left me gasping and practically begging her to suck me off. The girl had a spine made of steel.  
  
  I bit back a grin and focused instead on hating her.  
  
  Work. I would just focus on work and stop thinking about her. I walked over to my desk and sat down, trying to direct my attention to anything but thoughts of how amazing those lips felt around me last night.  
  
  Not conducive, Bennett.  
  
  I flipped open my laptop to check my schedule for the day. My schedule . . . shit. The bitch had the most up-to-date version in her computer. Hopefully I wasn’t missing any meetings this morning, because I was not calling Ice Queen in here until I absolutely had to.  
  
  As I was going over a spreadsheet, a knock came at my door. “Come in,” I called out. A white envelope was slammed down onto my desk. I looked up to see Miss Mills staring down at me with a defiantly crooked eyebrow. Without an explanation, she turned and walked out of my office.  
  
  I glared at the envelope, panicked. Likely it was a formal letter detailing my conduct and indicating her intent to file a harassment suit. I expected letterhead and her scribbled signature at the bottom of the page.  
  
  What I didn’t expect was a sales receipt from an online clothing store . . . charged to the company credit card. I shot up out of the chair and raced out of my office after her. She was headed for the stairwell. Good. We were on the eighteenth floor, and nobody, besides maybe the two of us, ever used the stairs. I could scream at her all I wanted and no one would be the wiser.  
  
  The door closed with a heavy clang and her heels echoed their way down the stairs just in front of me.  
  
  “Miss Mills, where in the hell do you think you’re going?”  
  
  She continued walking without turning back to look at me. “We’re out of coffee,” she hissed. “So as your office girl, I’m going down to the café on fourteen to retrieve some. Can’t have you missing out on your caffeine fix.”  
  
  How could someone so hot be such a bitch? I caught up to her on the landing between floors and grabbed her arm, pushing her against the wall. Her eyes narrowed contemptuously at me, her teeth clenched in a hiss. I whipped the receipt up in front of her face as I glared back at her. “What is this?”  
  
&n  
bsp; She shook her head. “You know, for such a pompous know-it-all, you really are a stupid son of a bitch sometimes. What does it look like? It’s a receipt.”  
  
  “I can see that,” I growled through my teeth, crumpling the paper into my clenched fist. I pressed the sharp tip of it into the delicate skin just above her breast and felt my cock twitch when she gasped and her eyes dilated. “Why are you making clothing purchases on your company credit card?”  
  
  “Some bastard tore my blouse.” She shrugged her shoulders and then leaned her face closer to me and whispered, “And my panties.”  
  
  Well, fuck.  
  
  I took a deep breath through my nose and threw the paper to the floor, leaning forward and pressing my lips against hers and digging my fingers into her hair, pinning her body against the wall. My dick throbbed against her abdomen as I felt her hand mirror my own and grip my hair, fisting it roughly.  
  
  I pulled her dress up along her thighs and groaned into her mouth as my fingers once again found the lace edge of her thigh highs. She did this to torment me, she had to. I felt her tongue run over my lips as my fingertips brushed the warm and wet material of her panties. I clenched my hold around the fabric and gave it a rough tug.  
  
  “Make a note to order another pair then,” I hissed and then pressed my tongue between her lips and into her mouth.  
  
  She groaned deeply as I thrust two fingers inside of her, and if it was possible, she was even wetter than she’d been last night. Seriously fucked-up situation we have going on here. She broke away from my lips with a gasp as I fucked her hard with my fingers, my thumb rubbing vigorous circles on her clit.  
  
  “Get your cock out,” she said. “I need to feel you in me. Now.”  
  
  I narrowed my eyes at her, trying to hide the effect her words had on me.  
  
  “Say please, Miss Mills.”  
  
  “Now,” she said more urgently.  
  
  “Bossy much?”  
  
  She gave me a look that would shrivel the dick off a lesser man and I laughed in spite of myself. Mills could hold her own. “Good thing I’m feeling generous.”

1m5pf2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1m5pf2t/what_are_realistic_and_unrealistic_26f/,What are realistic and unrealistic [26F] texting/time together expectations early on in dating?,"Just got ghosted by a guy [30M] I was talking to for two weeks after I asked if we could spend more time together. There's a sort of recurring theme in my dating life where I get told (directly or indirectly) that I'm too needy. My friends are no help because obviously they're always on my side. 

One thing that comes up is texting. A lot of the guys I try to date will only send one reply every 24 hours during the week day. Not like one conversation a day but they'll take the time to reply once in the evening. Waiting for a reply all day tends to make me anxious and it's hard for me to personally understand why, if you like someone, you wouldn't want to talk to them. But I know women text more so maybe I just lack perspective. Even if I'm busy in clinic, in the OR, on nights, etc. I'm still pretty good about responding to my texts when I like someone. Just because I feel like that shows consideration. 

I used to just not say anything but I've been trying to communicate my thoughts more. When I ask if they can try to text more often because I like having that communication and I'm just personally a chit-chatty person, they tell me that's just how they are and they have no desire to text me more. With the most recent man, I expressed that it made me sad but that I could try to adjust to his communication style. Then, the next issue of time together came up. I'm unfortunately out of the city during the weekday for medical rotations this month so we could only spend time together Friday through Sunday. 

The first date was fine, we grabbed drinks and spent the evening together. Then the next weekend he mentioned going to watch a film at the theater and when I met up with him he decided he wanted to sit in a park and then we just went to his apartment and watched a movie. Then the next weekend he said we could spend the morning together and then get dinner in the evening but the day of he said he had to cancel dinner because of a family event that came up but we could spend like 2 hours getting a coffee but then he wanted to take a nap and go play a sports game with his friend. I asked about Sunday but every Sunday for he spends it with his mother. I was sad but tried to hide it (admittedly probably not that well). I later asked if we could spend more time together because I felt sad we could only spend 2 hours a week with one another. Then he ghosted me. 

I'm not that sad that I've lost him specifically because I was sensing some incompatibilities anyways but I would like perspective on what are realistic texting and time spent together expectations as I'm getting dejavu from this all. And in the future, should I keep these to myself or communicate them. Because communicating my wants is going really poorly for me. I just get told ""no"" or told I'm too needy or ghosted. I just want perspective. If I'm wrong and asking for too much from others, I want to grow and be better. But then again maybe I'm not asking for too much? Maybe these are the wrong men?

## Key features Analysis

The defining characteristics of Baileys contribute significantly to its popularity and premium pricing.

**Alcohol Content:** Baileys Irish Cream typically has an alcohol content of 17% ABV (alcohol by volume). This moderate alcohol level makes it approachable for a wide range of consumers, contributing to its mass-market appeal without sacrificing the warmth and complexity typically associated with alcoholic beverages.

**Ingredients:** The core ingredients of Baileys include Irish whiskey, fresh Irish dairy cream, and a proprietary cocoa extract. The quality and source of these ingredients heavily influence its price. The Irish whiskey provides the base spirit and contributes to the liqueur's depth of flavor, while the fresh dairy cream imparts its signature smoothness and richness. The secret cocoa extract adds a delightful chocolatey note that balances the whiskey and cream.

**Production Process:** Baileys utilizes a unique homogenization process that blends the whiskey and cream without separation. This advanced technology ensures the consistent texture and flavor profile that consumers expect. The manufacturing process involves rigorous quality control measures, ensuring the highest standards of ingredients and production.

**Packaging & Branding:** Baileys utilizes iconic and instantly recognizable packaging, typically featuring a cream-colored bottle with distinct lettering. This branding reinforces its image as a premium product. Packaging sizes vary, including standard 750ml bottles, smaller individual serving sizes, and larger formats for parties. The investment in premium bottle design and branding contributes to its perceived value and price point.

**Shelf Life:** Baileys has a relatively long shelf life compared to other cream-based liqueurs. The alcohol content and manufacturing process creates a product that can be stored, unrefrigerated, for up to two years from the date of manufacture, although refrigeration after opening is recommended. This longevity reduces waste and makes the product a convenient option for consumers.

1m5paij,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1m5paij/common_poster_staring_at_me/,Common Poster Staring at me,"Common poster staring at me (Part 1)

It came into our shop like any other work related poster. Smiling faces and an employee actively doing something to remind us what a good worker is. Or a poster job advertisement about growth, opportunity and teamwork.

It didn’t seem like it would be menacing or distracting by any means.

It was a bald white man organizing a fuel filter on a parts rack. His teeth glistening white, his complexion shined with his bald head, his hands were clean (about the only thing off, mechanics hands are rarely clean), and his outfit looked new & pressed (another thing that  was definitely a falsehood).

It came in a week before Halloween. We weren’t suppose to decorate anything in or around the checkin work desk. (We were told it would distract from what we were selling and we had to keep it professional).

I came in early, 7am (my shift is normally 930am). My boss was putting up the bald white man work poster while I was sipping my morning coffee from my favorite tin thermos (it was my grandmothers and it gave me comfort).

Jim (Boss)- “I am being told the new policies, new tablets with new system will be in tomorrow around noon. So expect delays on the work orders. We will have to do old fashion paper.”

Me (Kimberly) - “I need help more than anything. They just seem like they don’t want to stay and work anymore.”

Jim - “It is coming Kim. Too much weirdos and druggies these days. Hard to keep a straight face with all the stories I’ve been hearing why they are quitting and such.”

Me- “ I can’t do it all on my own. We are down to three and the night guy is shifty. Always taking about how he is being stared at. “

Jim- “yeah, I will look into that later. We got corporate coming in later today. So if you need anything I will be in the head office next to the fuel island.”

We normally would start with small talk and bullshit for 10-15 minutes but when corporate was coming same day Jim was cleaning dust off old cans and window sills.

The new poster in my work station was probably the most crisp looking one yet. Most of my shift was normal until I had to get off later at 830pm because the night guy was showing up late.

Me-“Dammit Bobby, this is the second time this week! You know I have to look after my elderly neighbor Jacky and her dog Pooch. She is going to rip into tonight because we are supposed to watch old reruns of the price is right and jeopardy.”

Bobby- “Listen now, I’m sorry and I know that isn’t enough but I haven’t been sleeping right. Starting to think there is a curse or sickness going around. Anyways I’m going to try to do better. I gotcha, see you tomorrow Kim.”

I got to my neighbor Jacky’s house to be visited by her dog Pooch at the front door. Jacky didn’t wait to watch her reruns, she couldn’t be upset at me because she was fast asleep in her favorite lazy boy chair with a quilt she knitted a month prior. I decided to go to the kitchen and pantry to see if she needed groceries, she drank through milk like a teenager practicing thru football hell week. So I already knew that was on the list. With the milk in my hand, I sipped the last of it she always kept for me or the neighborhood cats. I jokingly said “meow” after I got to the last drop and my phone rang. 

Strange Voices came from it.
- “You got it sweetheart, keep ped…”static*
- “You’ll never make it if you keep that attitude…” static* “Somethings down there, way…” static*
Me - “Hello? Who is buttdailing me!?” I laughed.
Me - “ok, bye…”
 
I tapped the red end button softly. Thinking about how my father used to say those exact words. “You got it sweetheart!”, when it was the most important to me and most memorable. That was meaningful to me, “you got it.”

The next morning was great, the boss and I were now more relaxed that corporate came thru and did what they normally do. 

“Chatter, Correct and Complex, The triple C’s that bother you and me.” - Jim laughed and grinned tightly. Exhaling a weight off his round stomach and bold shoulders.

We both knew what it met… 
More work, less pay and the old “atta boy!” after you change a slight disorganized display or answer a certain email review. Corporate lived for reviews, they thought those were answers to problems and commission is payroll.

It was 5 days until Halloween and somebody’s kid’s candies will be under my desk because of dad tax. That was the highlight of the week for me. Everything else went smoothly except some unruly customers that didn’t want to pay for their repairs.

At night though, Bobby didn’t show. It was 9pm and I called him several times. At least six text messages and 3 voicemails. I was getting sick of this shit. 

The poster, I could’ve sworn it moved. At least the eyes. When I laughed it up with Jim this morning, I might have thought it smiled more… like it was laughing at our dark sense of humor. Every shop makes bad jokes but no one goes unnoticed or disregarded. It felt like I was missing something, someone, or… Nevermind it’s getting late. My neighbor Jacky has her sister over so I’m okay to not show. I closed shop and called Jim, he was as upset as I was and said he would call around tomorrow.

On the drive home I was aggravated, I was speeding home and I just sick of the day to day.
Blue and Red Light appeared behind me, I pulled over on the I-20 next to my exit (only a few miles from home, so close.)

Officer Dan - “Oh it’s Kimberly, dude you know how fast you were going?”

Me - “Dan, just tell me and give me my damn ticket! I’m trying to make it home!”

Officer Dan - “You’ll never make it if you keep that attitude.”

Dans radio played static and made a series of beeps.

GREYSCALE


```

My life is in greyscale.
Grey days.
Black nights.
Depression and suicidal thoughts
crackle like static through a broken speaker.

I wear the facade
smiles stitched from borrowed color,
laughter timed like a metronome.
Just enough to blend in.
Just enough to not unravel.

Since you left,
the world burst into neon
too loud, too bright, too wrong.
A fever dream of glittering nights
and spinning signs,
where nothing makes sense
and everything pretends to matter.

Time bends sideways.
Memories smear like wet paint on glass.
I live between pixels
grainy, flickering frames of
what was,
what might’ve been,
what I lie to myself still could be.

Reality slurs.
Nothing aligns.
Conversations loop like broken VHS.
My thoughts glitch in the static.

I chase fantasy like oxygen.
Touch. Chaos. Distraction.
Late-night strangers, glitter-streaked lips.
Candlelit tea parties,
girls in loud makeup bleeding color into the dark beneath club strobes.
Lies worn in velvet, eyeliner, and walks between scene clubs.

Nights spent with those living
mirrorball lives in hollow rooms,
doing anything to catch the light.
To feel.
To burn.

Because in this greyscale life,
truth slices like glass,
and silence booms like thunder.

So I lie:
That I’m healing.
That this is joy.
That I’m not screaming beneath the shimmer.
That I’m not still waiting
for someone to love the wreckage.

So I drift through the blur
among glamorous ghosts
in fluorescent dive bars,
where glitter masks grief,
and every laugh echoes empty.

Hope casts its silhouette
on the shell I inhabit 
a reanimated frame,
drenched in artificial noise and synthetic light,
still reaching for anything
that proves
I’m alive.

02 February  

I awoke to the sounds of owls on my balcony. They come here often, perhaps they recognize me as their own. It was 11:40 pm when I woke up, half an hour late than I would have liked to.... but rather insignificant for my purposes. I peeked out the window, the sky was clear. Meaning I wouldn't have to go back to my slumber tonight. I went to the balcony, to set up my camera, but when I opened the door, my body shook violently from the cold air outside. In my excitement I had forgotten to bring my coat, an all to common occurrence for me. I often seem to forget the fact that I am not in the humid Mumbai anymore, but in the freezing foothills of the Himalayas.  

  

I had moved here a couple years ago, got get away from the glitz and glamour of society. I had always preferred to be left in my own company. But the need to make something of myself overwhelmed my wish to be alone when I approached my mid-twenties. I saw an opportunity in the rising demand of national and international companies to get custom software for their various purposes. I assembled a team of similar minded computer programmer and formed a company. One which become one of the largest IT companies in India. After a while, about 7 year later, A different passion took over me, a passion for photography, astrophotography specifically. I sold my shares of the company to my partner and left Mumbai. I needed to quite and isolated place, as the bright city lights would block any and all light except the moon from space. This place that I was looking for happened to be a lone town amidst the foothills of the Himalayas, Sundarbagh.   

  

Currently, I grabbed my coat as quickly as I could, not wanting to lose anymore time before the sun rose. I got my camera and attached it to the end of my telescope. I got on my laptop and started the long process of tracking the moon and capturing many photographs in order to stich together a full view of the moon. It was nothing I hadn't done a dozen times before. In fact, today I was working on my project to capture the whole cycle of the moon. I was early in the project... 5 days in. The last 4 days had gone exceptionally well, and I expected this to turn out similarly. I set everything up and went to make some coffee. This was my daily routine. As I wanted to capture photographs of various celestial bodies, I had to be present when they were. The locals called me Nishachar or one who stays up in the night. I did not know it was to mock me or just a nickname.  

  

When I got back with my coffee, I saw that my computer had crashed. I set aside my coffee and scrambled to get too my chair. I restarted my computer to see that perhaps it had saved the first few images and that I did not have to start over again. It had saved some images, a minute or two of footage. Towards the end I found that the camera had stopped tracking the moon and instead had lagged slightly behind the moon. Since these images were pretty much unusable, I went to delete them, but Suddenly a sense a curiosity took over me and I decided to  look through them. They were what I had expected. But then I noticed a little smudge... perhaps a distant galaxy. But that was impossible, I knew the night sky of this region like the back of my hand. I knew of all the galaxies that my telescope could capture and had captured a good number of them, but this seeming popped out of the sky.  

  

I was overtook with excitement. Had I discovered a new galaxy that was perhaps hidden from us because of the brightness of the moon? I was already thinking of names for it. Then the voice of reason inside my head chimed in. I should not get excited, perhaps it was a smudge on the lens, an optical illusion? I went to check the lens and got my various book in order to find out if it was a trick of the light or an already discovered galaxy. What I wouldn't have given have an internet connection at that instant. Yet after hours of shifting through the pages, I could not find anything. The sun had already begun to rise up, and there was no prospect of getting more pictures at this point. I also had to buy groceries, I had barely enough left. I deiced that today I should buy groceries and other things. I would spent the whole next night capturing picture of this object, and then the day after tomorrow, I would go contact the nearest observatory, the 3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope or 3.6m DOT and try to get access to their large telescope.  

  

03 February  

The next afternoon I found myself in my bed trying to force myself to sleep. I felt too excited to sleep, But I knew if I didn't sleep now, I would inevitably fall asleep at the most crucial moment. I had made this mistake enough times to know that it was extremally important to sleep now. I set my alarm to 9:00 and closed my eyes, searching for sleep. I woke up at 8:45, before the alarm, I got myself a coffee quickly and opened the balcony doors. The cold wind blew across my scarcely dressed body but I barely felt it. I attached my camera to my telescope and configured it to that spot that I had the object in yesterday. To my surprise, it was gone. I felt like I had been cheated. This was an error after all... still I looked near the spot. I could find nothing. I was sad, but felt like I shouldn't waste the night. So I went to focus my camera on the moon. I still had a project after all. But as I shifted my telescope, I saw something that I could never had anticipated. the object seemed to have moved. it was closer to the moon than the previous night, but the moon was in a completely different portion of the sky than yesterday.  

  

This ruled out the possibility that this was a distant galaxy, since this was not physically feasible for a distant galaxy. I now had to play the guessing game again. It could be possible that this was a comet, since it had a kind of tail. but in order for it to cover such great distance, either it would have to be very close to the earth, or moving with a great speed. I was delighted with this discovery. I started to flip through pages of my books to find if this comet was already discovered. I left the camera running. After some time, when I went to check the pictures my camera had caught, I found that the laptop had once again crashed. I immediately tried rebooted the computer, but to no avail. The computer wouldn't respond. The machine was pretty old, and being in the cold  winds of the Himalayas hadn't done it any favors. I usually kept backup of every night of footage, but in my excitement I had forgotten yesterday.  

  

I decided that the best course of action would be to contact the people at 3.6 m DOT, and inquire about it. I ran towards my phone, but suddenly stopped, remembering that it was closed today and that there would be no one on the other end at this time. I had memorized their schedule, since I often found myself trying to contact them. I also needed to fix my laptop. But a laptop repair would take time, and I didn't know if I would get another chance to capture the object, if it was a comet. I decided that I would take my old laptop to try and get the data back, and in the meantime, buy another laptop. I was still full of energy, because I had just woken up one and half hours ago, but I had to wait for daytime to do anything. If only my owl friends were of any use.  

  

06 February  

The last three days have been quite eventful. So much so that I didn't have time to update my journal. I am currently sitting in the town library, and contemplating if I am crazy or not. Let me try to jot down everything that has occurred while my memory is still fresh.  

  

I was awake the whole night, when the clock struck 9:00, I knew that the observatory was open. I called immediately. A familiar voice answered the phone, it was my friend, he worked at the observatory. We had met a few years back in Mumbai. Our passion for astrophotography and space brought us together. He was a native of Sundarbagh and suggested the place when I expressed my desire to move to a quite place to pursue astrophotography. He was also a big fan of folklore, another trait we shared. Since he was brought up in Sundarbagh, he was quite familiar with the local folklore, a topic which would often fuel our discussion for hours. He didn't sound very excited when I called, I was a bit a of an annoyance. I asked him if they had captured a comet or something like it the day before yesterday and if they had any idea of what it was. He replied that they had a technical difficulty that day and couldn't capture anything. I was disappointed, but I was hopeful as my friend reassured that they would try to capture it that night.   

  

I prepared to make my journey into town, my home was a little isolated and on a slight hill. I got my laptop and money. The town had not computer store, So I had to travel several kilometers to the nearest city to get to the store. I arrived home late at night, though I had been awake for about 24 hours, I still had some energy left. I connected my laptop to my camera and focused on the moon. I started looking near the moon. I had some trouble finding the object, but I did find it at last. I was looking at the images being captured when I realized something, the tail of the object had reversed. Furthermore, the object seemed to slow down. Just then, my computer crashed.... again. I panicked, and  got up and on the balcony, detached the camera from the telescope and looked through it with my own eyes. focusing on the space near the moon, I tried to find the object but was unsuccessful. It just disappeared.   

  

At this point, a suspicion popped into my mind. Can it be that the camera was malfunctioning? perhaps it had some fault in its software, it was a digital camera after all. I was still determined to capture the object on camera. Restarting the computer I found that the images had not yet been saved in the hard disk and were lost. I tried multiple times that night to capture the object, But was ultimately unsuccessful.  

  

The sun arose the next day, I arose six hours later, about 12 o'clock. Today I made plans to meet my friend at the observatory, and also find books on comets. I had books on galaxies, stars, planets, nebulas etc., but not comets. I arrived at about 4pm at the observatory, an hour before closing. Meeting my friend I inquired about the object. He said that they found no such thing the previous day, or the previous week. They captured what they had expected, nothing out of the ordinary. My friend seemed a little anxious, so I asked him what was eating him. He told that in Sundarbagh, he had often heard of the legend of the 'Krishtarakam' or the dark star. He was caught up in his work, so he suggested that I visit the nearby library to read about it. The library was not for off, and had a adjacent hotel. When I went to pick up the recovered data of my old laptop, I heard on the radio that there was a chance of a storm to occur that night. It would take me at least 2 hours to get to Sundarbagh in a cab, like I came here in the afternoon, but since no cab driver in his right mind would choose to travel when a storm is forecasted, I had to stay the night here. I checked into the hotel near the library, and since I had no appetite for sleep,  I decided to read about the folklore that my friend told me about, the Krishtarakam.   

  

I entered the library and got to the folklore section. There was a huge bookshelf in front of me, filled with tons of books. It would be impossible for me to look through all of them. Just then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a book, labeled 'Famous folklores of Sundarbagh'. What a coincidence, As I flipped through the pages, I read about all types of demons and monsters. Some I already knew about thanks to my friend and neighbours. I spent hours looking though them. Halfway through the book, I found the legend of Krishtarakam. At this point I had completely forgotten that I came here to read about this in the first place. The legend fascinated me, and I have tried my best to remember every detail and recall the legend below.  

  

Long ago, when Sundarbagh was know as a home to the saint of ancient India, there was a learned saint, known as Amritnath. He had a hunger for knowledge which granted him immense knowledge and power. His fellow saint started noticing something odd about him. Every night Amritnath would say a prayer to the moon. This new practice bothered and confused the other saints and they set out to find what was the meaning behind it. They found that Amritnath believed that the moon held the ultimate power of the universe and whoever held that power controlled the universe. They found that Amritnath had planned to take this alleged power for himself and rule the universe. While the other saints found it absurd, they also recognized that Amritnath was power-hungry, and that someone as powerful and knowledgeable as him would lead to no good result. So the other saints caught him by surprise and trapped his soul in a huge black rock and flung the rock to space. Now Amritnath wanders the darkness of space, every year getting very close to the moon in the winter months, but missing his target. The legend tells that Amritnath waits for a host, a host who can be enchanted by the mystery of the Krishtarakam. Amritnath would then try to take control of his body, using his powers to change the world around the host in order to draw him closer, to make the host bridge the mental gap between them and take control of the body to act on his sinister plan once again.  

  

As soon as I finished reading, my mind got filled with excitement. I could see why the object reminded my friend of this, the familiarity is uncanny. And I believed that in fact, this legend was the local people's way of describing a phenomenon that they had been seeing for centuries, perhaps even millennia. I now had historical proof that the object was in fact, real. At least it was proof to me.  

  

I got up and went to my hotel room. Just before I entered my room, a staff member approached me and told me that there was a call for me. I went to the front desk to pick up the call, it was my friend. I hadn't told him where I was going to stay, but seeing as this was the only hotel in the area, he must have guessed that I had checked in here. He told me that at the observatory, they had just captured an image of an unidentified object near the moon. I was ecstatic and asked him if I could come to the observatory. He stopped me saying that the weather was getting worse and that I should stay in the hotel. HE wasn't wrong, in a few minutes the winds turned and blew with great velocity. The sky that was shining with thousands of stars some time ago was now covered with clouds. I slept soundly that day.  

  

The next day when I woke up, the weather was fine, but looked like it could worsen, so I wasted no time and got a cab. After reaching home, I decided that my first course of action should be to check the recovered data on the hard drive. I connected the hard drive to my computer and stated to look through the pictures of 2nd and 3rd February. The pictures were there on the hard drive, to my relief. But there was something off, the object was nowhere to be seen. I looked through every single image but could find nothing. I felt as if someone was playing a prank on me. But there was not much to be sad about, the observatory had captured the object the previous day. I went to call the observatory, since it was now about 10 am. But to my disappointment, I found that my phone was not working. On asking the neighbours, I found that the telephone line had been cut, presumably due to the bad weather. I felt a sense of emergency. for the past few days, ever since I discovered the object, I had been feeling a kind of paranoia or uncertainty, and it was at an all time high right then. I rushed to the cab that had taken me here and said to the driver that I urgently had to go back. The driver was confused, but he did not deny me.  

  

After I reached the observatory, I found my friend outside the building. he looked distressed. I asked what was the matter, and he said that the observatory was struck by lightning the previous night and that the storage room was completely destroyed. Seeing the building behind him, there was not a doubt in my mind about the fact he just told me. I asked him if the footage of the object had survived. He looked puzzled and said that they did not capture anything like that the previous day and even if they had, it would have been destroyed. I thought he was joking with me and asked him about the phone call. He said that he did not make any such call. Without saying anything more, I rushed towards the hotel I had stayed at the previous night. The receptionist greeted me. I inquired about the phone call made yesterday for me. She said that they received no calls for tenets that day, and proceeded to show me a written log of phone calls, she wasn't lying. At this point the mystery and confusion had started taking its toll on me and I felt my chest racing. For some reason I went into the library. I sat down and started recording everything in my journal, this journal. I have a terrible feeling that someone is deliberately causing these events; but who? Who can change things already done? I don't know, I may never know. I feel that I have done something that I don't yet understand.  

  

I am leaving this journal in the library for now. If I return, I will continue this entry. If not, this for someone else to find. ",2,1753119032.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1m5p6tj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m5p6tj,Color for wall cabinet/bookshelf (and other suggestions welcome),"Hello! We bought our home six months ago and the main living area has been a work in progress. We’ve gotten several things for free/second hand/repurposed.

Bookshelf/cabinet: I’d like to buy a large cabinet with a bookshelf top (see samples photos 6-9) for the wall where the desk is currently, which will be removed. We want a piece with deep cabinets at the bottom for toys/etc storage and a combo of books, knick-knacks and bins on top. The space is 90” wide and door height is 82”.

What color, whether wood or white, should we go with? You’ll notice we have a mix of wood in the room already. Any ideas on a specific cabinet to go with? Our walls and ceilings are Swiss Coffee color. We’d like to spend under $1000. I’ve also been perusing FB marketplace and such. Needs to be ready to go, we don’t have the energy to refinish or paint.

Any other design advice for the room in general/ things you would do?

Things to note:

•	⁠we have a second matching green chair coming. •	⁠we need to lower the painting on the green wall and install a wall sconce (see last photo) and have a bar wall sconce coming for above the tv. Those placements were existing. •	⁠we have a 3 week old baby and two dogs. I will never have a high design home, but trying to not lose my vision completely. The dog kennel end table was challenging for me to accept lol. I like a comfy and functional mid-century feel. Our house was built in 1960. •	⁠we went with a smaller rug as the room gets a lot of traffic with the entry door and garage door on the other end of the room.

A Saltwater Owner’s Perspective,"I was lucky enough to win a Beatbot AquaSense 2 Ultra during the giveaway, and I couldn’t be more appreciative. Now that it’s had time to settle into my L kidney shaped saltwater pool, I wanted to share how it’s been going, and honestly, it’s awesome.

From the moment it hit the water and started mapping like it was planning a heist, I knew I had something special. It handles walls, corners, and even makes determined runs at my layered wedding cake style steps, something every other robot has given up on entirely. After a windy day, I’d usually be out there skimming and muttering to myself. But with Beatbot? I just stand back with an iced coffee and admire the hustle.

If a friend asked me whether it’s worth it, I’d say absolutely. It doesn’t wander randomly, it actually thinks before it moves, and it’s the first cleaner I’ve owned that truly feels like it knows my pool. Add in the 3-year warranty, and it feels like a solid investment, especially compared to the short lived bots I’ve dealt with before.

It’s even made me laugh. One afternoon I watched it take five determined cracks at the steps, pausing halfway up like it was rethinking its life choices before trying again. It didn’t make it, but I respected the effort. And the built in floodlights? Total vibe after dark.

For other saltwater pool owners, I have noticed a little rust forming on the charging contacts, likely from the salt and other metals in the water. But I keep a rag nearby and give it a quick wipe now and then, easy fix, nothing to worry about.

Big thanks again to the Beatbot team. I never thought a pool robot would have personality, but this one kind of does and it’s made pool ownership way more enjoyable.

  REYES STOOD on the roof of his Budapest fortress, five stories up, his feet balanced precariously on the highest ledge. Above him, moonlight seeped red and yellow from the sky, blood mixed with fickle gold, dark mixed with light, wounds freshly cut in the endless expanse of black velvet.  
  
  He gazed down at the gloomy, waiting void beneath him, the taunting ground opening its arms as if begging to embrace him. Thousands of years, and I'm still reduced to this.  
  
  Frigid wind blustered, ruffling his hair in every direction, tickling his bare chest, the hated butterfly etched up onto his neck and the remembered lifeblood splattered there. Not his blood, though. No, not his, but his friend's. Every stroke of hair against that phantom evidence of life and death was like kindling thrown into the fire of his blazing guilt.  
  
  So many times he'd come here, wishing for things that could never be. So many times he'd prayed for absolution, relief from his daily torment and the demon inside him responsible. . . relief from his utter dependence on self-mutilation.  
  
  His prayers had never been answered. Would never be answered. This was what he was, what he would always be. And his agony would only increase. Once an immortal warrior to the gods, he was now a Lord of the Underworld, possessed by one of the many spirits formerly locked inside dimOuniak. From favor to dishonor, beloved to despised. From happiness to constant misery.  
  
  He ground his teeth. Mortals knew dimOuniak as Pandora's box; he knew it as the source of his eternal downfall. He and his friends had defiantly opened it all those centuries ago; now he and his friends were the box, each holding a demon inside himself.  
  
  Jump, his demon beseeched.  
  
  His demon: Pain. His constant companion. The tempting whisper in the back of his mind, the dark entity that craved unspeakable evil. The supernatural force he battled every damned minute of every damned day.  
  
  Jump.  
  
  ""Not yet. "" A few more seconds of anticipation, of knowing most of his bones would shatter on contact. He grinned at the thought. The razor-sharp bone shards would cut his injured, swollen organs and those organs would burst like water balloons; his skin would rip from the excess fluid and this time the lifeblood that drained would be his own. Agony, such blissful agony, would consume him.  
  
  For a little while, anyway.  
  
  Slowly his smile faded. Within days - hours, if he failed to hurt himself badly enough - his body would heal itself, totally and completely. He would wake up, whole again, Pain once more a commanding force inside his mind, too loud to be denied. But oh, for those few blessed ticks of the clock before his bones began to realign, before his organs began to weave back together and his skin to reconnect, before blood once more pumped through his veins, he would experience nirvana. The ultimate paradise. Rapture of the sweetest kind. He would writhe in the exquisite pleasure the pain brought with it - his only source of pleasure. The demon would purr with utter contentment, so drunk on the sensation it was unable to speak, and Reyes would experience such blissful peace.  
  
  For a little while. Always, only, a little while.  
  
  ""I do not need another reminder about how fleeting my peace is,"" he muttered to drown the depressing thought. He knew how quickly time passed. A year sometimes felt like nothing more than a day. A day sometimes felt like nothing more than a minute.  
  
  ""The Darkest Pleasure""  
  
  And yet, both were sometimes infinite to him. Just one of the many contradictions of life as a Lord of the Underworld.  
  
  Jump, Pain said. Then, more insistently, Jump! Jump!  
  
  ""I told you. Just a few seconds more. "" Once again Reyes glanced at the ground. Jagged rocks winked in that bleeding moonlight, the clear puddles surrounding them rippling in the wind. Mist rose like ghostly fingers, summoning him closer, wonderfully closer. ""Plunging a blade into your enemy's throat kills him, yes,"" he told the demon, ""but then it's over, done, and you have nothing left to anticipate. ""  
  
  Jump! A snarled command, impatient and needy, a child throwing a tantrum.  
  
  ""Soon. ""  
  
  Jumpjumpjump!  
  
  Yes, sometimes demons really were like whiny human children. Reyes shoved a hand through his tangled hair, a few strands ripping from his scalp. He knew of only one way to shut his other half up. Obedience. Why he'd even tried to resist and savor the moment, he didn't know.  
  
  Jump!  
  
  ""Maybe this time you'll be sent back to hell,"" he muttered. A man could wish, anyway. Finally, he splayed his arms. Closed his eyes. Leaned. . . ""Come down from there,"" he heard a voice say from behind him.  
  
  Reyes's eyelids popped open at the unwelcome intrusion, and he stiffened. He rebalanced but didn't turn. He knew why Lucien was here, and he was too ashamed to face his friend. While the warrior understood what he dealt with because of his demon, there would be no understanding what he'd done.  
  
  ""That's the plan, coming down. Leave and I'll see that it gets done. ""  
  
  ""You know what I meant. "" There was no hint of laughter in Lucien's voice. ""I need to talk to you. ""  
  
  The dewy scent of roses suddenly saturated the air, thick and lush and so unexpected in the late-winter night that Reyes would have sworn he'd been transported to a spring meadow. A human would have found the aroma hypnotic, lulling, almost drugging, and would have done anything the warrior asked. Reyes merely found it annoying. After thousands of years together, Lucien should have known the fragrance held no power over him.  
  
  ""We'll talk tomorrow,"" he said tightly.  
  
  Jump!  
  
  ""We'll talk now. Afterward, you may do whatever you please. ""  
  
  After Reyes admitted his newest crime? No, thanks. Guilt, shame and grief might bring emotional pain, but none would soothe his demon in a  
ny way. Only physical suffering offered relief, which was why Reyes had always guarded his emotional well-being so diligently.  
  
  Yes, and you've done such a great job at it.  
  
  He ran his tongue over his teeth, unsure who had whispered that sarcastic little gem. Himself or Pain. ""I'm in a bad place right now, Lucien. ""  
  
  ""As are the others. As am I. ""  
  
  ""You, at least, have a woman to comfort you. ""  
  
  ""You have friends. You have me. "" Lucien, keeper of the demon of Death, was tasked with escorting human souls to the hereafter, whether the hereafter was heaven or the deepest fires of hell. He was stoic, ever calm - most of the time. He'd become their leader, the man every warrior residing in this Budapest fortress turned to for guidance and aid. ""Talk to me. ""  
  
  Reyes didn't like to deny his friend, but he told himself it was better that Lucien did not learn the terrible thing he'd done.  
  
  Even as Reyes thought it, he recognized the lie for what it was: a shameful lack of courage on his part. ""Lucien,"" he began, only to stop. Growl.  
  
  ""The tracking dye has worn off and no one knows where Aeron is,"" Lucien said. ""No one knows what he's doing, if he's the one who slaughtered those humans in the States. Maddox said he called you right after Aeron escaped the dungeon. Then Sabin told me you left Rome and the Temple of the Unspoken Ones in a hurry. Want to tell me where you went?""  
  
  ""No. "" Truth. He didn't. ""But you may rest assured Aeron is no longer able to slaughter humans. ""  
  
  There was a pause, the rose scent intensifying.  
  
  ""How do you know for sure?"" The question possessed a bite.  
  
  Reyes shrugged.  
  
  ""Why don't I tell you what I think happened?"" Where Lucien's tone had been sharp before, it was now threaded with expectation. And fear? ""You went after Aeron, hoping to protect the girl. ""  
  
  The girl. Aeron had kidnapped the girl. Aeron had been ordered by the new gods, the Titans, to murder the girl. Reyes had taken one look at the girl and allowed her to invade his most private thoughts, color his every action and reduce him to a lovesick fool.  
  
  With only a glance she had changed his life, and not for the better. And yet, the fact that Lucien refused to say her name pissed Reyes off royally. Reyes desired that girl more than he desired a hammer to the skull. For Pain, that was saying something.  
  
  ""Well?"" Lucien prompted.  
  
  ""You're right,"" Reyes said through tight lips. Why not admit it? he suddenly thought. His emotions were in turmoil and remaining quiet had only roused them further. More than that, his friends could not hate him any more than he hated himself. ""I went after Aeron. ""  
  
  The admission hung in the air, as heavy as shackles, and he paused.  
  
  ""The Darkest Pleasure""  
  
  ""You found him. ""  
  
  ""I found him. "" Reyes squared his shoulders. ""I also. . . destroyed him. ""  
  
  Rocks crumbled under Lucien's boots as he stalked forward. ""You killed him?""  
  
  ""Worse. "" Still, Reyes did not turn. He peered down longingly at the still-waiting ground. ""I buried him. ""  
  
  The pounding of footsteps ceased abruptly. ""You buried him but did not kill him?"" Confusion drifted from Lucien's voice. ""I do not understand. ""  
  
  ""He was about to kill Danika. I could see the torment in his eyes and knew he did not want to do it. I cut him down to slow him and he thanked me, Lucien. Thanked me. He begged me to stop him permanently. He begged me to take his head. But I couldn't do it. I raised my sword, but I just couldn't do it. So I had Kane collect Maddox's chains and bring them to me. Since Maddox no longer needs them, I used them to lock Aeron underground. ""  
  
  Reyes had once been forced to shackle Maddox to a bed every night, cursed to stab his friend in the stomach six hated times, knowing the warrior would awaken in the morning and Reyes would have to kill him all over again. Some friend I am.  
  
  After hundreds of years, Maddox had come to accept the curse. Restraining him, however, had been a necessity. As the keeper of Violence, Maddox tended to attack without warning. Even his friends. And as strong as the warrior was, he would have rent man-made metal in seconds. So they'd commandeered links forged by the gods, links no one, not even an immortal, could open without the proper key.  
  
  Like Maddox, Aeron had been - was - helpless against them. In the beginning, Reyes had resisted using them on his friend, not wanting to take even more of the warrior's freedom. Sadly, as with Maddox, employing them had become a necessity.  
  
  ""Where is Aeron, Reyes?"" Underneath the question was a command laced with the authority of a man used to getting what he wanted, when he wanted. A man who ensured there were severe consequences for any type of delay.  
  
  Reyes wasn't frightened. He simply hated to disappoint this warrior he loved like a brother. ""That, I will not tell you. Aeron doesn't wish to be freed. "" And even if he did, I do not think I would free him.  
  
  There lay the crux of Reyes's guilt.  
  
  Another pause slithered between them, this one strained and expectant. ""I can find him on my own. You know I can. ""  
  
  ""You have already tried and failed or you would not be here. "" Reyes knew that Lucien could flash into the spirit world and follow a person's unique psychic trail. Sometimes, though, the trail faded or became tainted.  
  
  Reyes suspected Aeron's was tainted, as the warrior was not the man he used to be.  
  
  ""You're right. His trail ends in New York,"" Lucien admitted darkly. ""I could continue my search, but that would take time. And time is something none of us can spare right now. Already two weeks have passed. ""  
  
  How well Reyes knew that, for he'd felt every day of those weeks like a noose tightening around his neck, one worry stacking upon another. Hunters, their greatest enemy, were even now searching for Pandora's box, hoping to use it to suck the demons out of each and every warrior, destroying man and locking away beast.  
  
  If the warriors wished to survive, they had to find the box first.  
  
  Chaotic as life now was, Reyes was not ready to end his permanently.  
  
  ""Tell me where he is,"" Lucien said, ""and I'll bring him to the fortress. I'll bolt him inside the dungeon. ""  
  
  Reyes snorted. ""He escaped once. He could escape again. Even from Maddox's chains, I'm thinking. His bloodlust gives him a strength I've never encountered before. Better he stay where he is. ""  
  
  ""He's your friend. He's one of us. ""  
  
  ""He's warped now, and you know it. Most of the time, he is not aware of his own actions. He would kill you if given the chance. ""  
  
  ""Reyes - ""  
  
  ""He'll destroy her, Lucien. ""  
  
  Her. Danika Ford. The girl. Reyes had seen her only a few times, talked to her even less, but still, he craved her with every ounce of his being. Something he didn't understand. He was dark, she was light. He was anguish, she was innocence. He was wrong for her in every way, and yet, when she looked at him, his entire world felt right.  
  
  He knew beyond any doubt that the next time Aeron reached her, the warrior would savagely murder her. There would be no stopping him. Not again. Aeron had been ordered to kill Danika - and her mother and her sister and her grandmother - and was as helpless against the gods and their powers as everyone else. He would do it.  
  
  Reyes's temper flared and he had to glance at the rocks below to calm himself. Aeron had resisted the gods' dark task at first. He was - No. He had been a good man. But with every day that had passed, his demon had grown stronger, louder inside his head, until finally it overtook his mind. Now Aeron was the demon inside him. He was Wrath. He obeyed. He slew. Until those four women were destroyed, he would live only to hunt and kill.  
  
  Except, inside Danika's temporary apartment those fourteen days, four hours and fifty-six minutes ago, there had been a small part of Aeron that had known the crimes he committed. A small part that hated who and what he had become and desired death above all things. Desired an end to the torment. Why else would Aeron have asked Reyes to kill him?  
  
  ""The Darkest Pleasure""  
  
  And I refused him. Reyes couldn't bring himself to hurt another warrior  
. Not again. Still. What kind of monster left his friend to suffer? A friend who had fought for him, killed for him? Loved him?  
  
  There had to be a way to save both Aeron and Danika, he thought for what, the thousandth time? He'd spent countless hours pondering, but still did not see a solution.  
  
  ""Do you know where the girl is?"" Lucien demanded, cutting into his musings.  
  
  ""No, I do not. "" Truth. ""Aeron found her, I found Aeron, and that's when we fought. She ran. I didn't follow her afterward. She could be anywhere by now. "" Best that way. He knew it, but he was still desperate to know her location, what she was doing. . . if she lived.  
  
  ""Lucien, man, what's taking so damn long?""  
  
  At the second intrusion, Reyes finally turned. Paris, keeper of Promiscuity, now stood beside Lucien. Both men were facing him, eyes narrowed. Beams of crimson moonlight fell around them but not on them, as if those colored rays were afraid to touch the evil that even hell itself had been unable to contain.  
  
  Immortal that he was, Reyes saw them clearly, gaze cutting expertly through the darkness.  
  
  Paris was tall, the tallest of the group, with multicolored hair, pale otherworldly skin and eyes so pure a blue not even the most fanciful poetry would do them justice. Human women found him mesmerizing, irresistible, constantly throwing themselves at him and begging for a single touch. A heated kiss.  
  
  Lucien, though mated now, was not so lucky. Human women stayed far away from him. His face was hideously scarred, grotesque even, giving him the appearance of a bedtime monster found only in fairy tales. Didn't help that he had mismatched eyes - a brown one that saw the natural world and a blue one that saw the spiritual world - and both promised death would soon come knocking.  
  
  Both men were corded with the kind of muscle mass only hours of daily physical exertion could provide. They were loaded down with weapons and ready to fight at any moment of any day. They had to be.  
  
  ""I don't recall deciding to throw a party up here,"" Reyes said.  
  
  ""Well, old age will wipe your memory like that,"" Paris replied. ""Remember, we need to discuss our next plan of action? Among other things. ""  
  
  He sighed. The warriors did what they wanted, when they wanted, and no biting remark would stop them. He knew that firsthand, because he was the exact same way. ""Why aren't you out researching Hydra's hiding places?""  
  
  Lush lips better suited for a woman thinned into a mulish line. Paris's eyes flashed the kind of agony Reyes usually saw staring back at him from his own mirror, replaced all too soon by the warrior's usual irreverence.  
  
  ""Well?"" Reyes prompted when there was no answer.  
  
  Finally his friend said, ""Even immortals need coffee breaks. ""  
  
  There was obviously more to the story than that, but Reyes didn't press. I am not the only man with secrets. Several weeks ago the warriors had split up to search for Hydra, a cranky half snake, half woman. . . thing who was guarding some of King Titan's favorite ""toys. "" Those toys - weapons, really - were supposed to lead them to Pandora's box. So far, they'd only managed to snag one. The Cage of Compulsion. They had only the barest of clues about the locations of the others.  
  
  ""Yes, but when faced with extinction, coffee breaks lose their importance. And yes, I realize I need to do more for our cause. I will. After. ""  
  
  Paris shrugged. ""I'm doing what I can. The U. S. is a huge damn place and studying it from afar is almost as difficult as navigating its lands amidst all those people. "" Each of the warriors had traveled to different countries to ferret out clues about the box, had no success and had quickly returned to learn what they could from here. Without switching his attention from Reyes, Paris asked Lucien, ""Did he tell you where Aeron is or what?""  
  
  One of Lucien's black brows arched toward his hairline. ""No. He didn't. ""  
  
  ""Told you he'd be difficult. "" Paris frowned. ""He hasn't been himself for weeks. ""  
  
  Reyes could say the same about Paris, he realized as he noticed lines of fatigue and stress around the usually optimistic man's eyes. Perhaps he should press Paris for answers. Clearly, something had happened to his friend. Something major.  
  
  ""We're running out of time, Reyes. "" Accusation coated Paris's words. ""Cooperate. Help us. ""  
  
  ""Hunters are more determined than ever to end us,"" Lucien added. ""Humans have discovered the Unspoken Ones' temple, limiting our access yet increasing that of the Hunters. We've only found one artifact out of four, but all are supposedly needed to locate the box. ""  
  
  Reyes arched a brow, mimicking Lucien's earlier expression. ""You think Aeron can help with any of that?""  
  
  ""No, but we do not need discord among us. Nor do we need the distraction of worrying about him. ""  
  
  ""You can stop worrying,"" Reyes said. ""He doesn't want to be found. He hates who and what he is and he hates us seeing him like that. I swear to you, he's content where he is or I would not have left him. ""  
  
  ""The Darkest Pleasure""  
  
  The door to the roof burst open and Sabin, keeper of Doubt himself, stalked through, dark hair dancing in the breeze.  
  
  ""For fuck's sake,"" the man said, throwing up his arms. ""What the hell's going on?"" He spotted Reyes and comprehension instantly dawned. He rolled his eyes. ""Damn, Pain, you sure know how to spoil a meeting. ""  
  
  ""Why aren't you researching Rome?"" Reyes asked him. Had everyone stopped working in the half hour he'd been on the roof?  
  
  Gideon, keeper of Lies, was close at Sabin's heels and prevented the warrior from answering with a sober, ""My, my, how fun this looks. ""  
  
  In Gideon speak, ""fun"" meant boring. The man couldn't utter a single truth without experiencing debilitating pain. Pain, exactly what I need. If only Reyes simply had to lie to receive it, how easy life would have been.  
  
  ""Shouldn't you be helping Paris research the States?"" Reyes demanded. He didn't bother waiting for an answer. ""This is starting to feel like a damned circus. Can't a man do a little sulking and self-mutilation in private?""  
  
  ""No,"" Paris said, ""he can't. Stop stalling, and stop changing the subject. Give us the answers we want or, I swear to the gods, I'm coming up there and laying a big wet one right on your mouth. My boy is hungry and looking to feed. He thinks you'll do just fine. ""  
  
  Reyes didn't doubt Promiscuity wanted to bed him, but he knew Paris, and knew the warrior preferred women.  
  
  Get rid of them. Reyes studied his newest guests. Gideon was dressed entirely in black, with hair dyed electric blue, eyebrows pierced in several places, the silver studs gleaming, and charcoal-rimmed eyelashes. Humans found him cut-your-heart-out scary.  
  
  Sabin wore all black, as well, but his brown hair, brown eyes and square, guileless face didn't make him look as if he would kill anyone who approached him - and laugh while doing it.  
  
  Both men were stubborn to their very cores.  
  
  ""I need time to think,"" Reyes said, hoping to play on their sympathy.  
  
  ""There's nothing to think about,"" Sabin replied. ""You will do what's right because you're an honorable warrior. ""  
  
  Aren't you? Perhaps you are as weak as the human girl you desire. Why else would you hurt those who love you like this?  
  
  Ouch, he thought, cringing. He was weak. He was - ""Sabin,"" Reyes growled as realization set in. ""Stop sending doubts into my mind. I have enough of my own. ""  
  
  The warrior shrugged sheepishly, not even trying to deny it. ""Sorry. ""  
  
  ""Since our meeting is clearly not canceled,"" Gideon said, ""I'm not heading into the city, not visiting Club Destiny, and not screwing a few screams of pleasure out of a human female. "" He disappeared behind the door a second later, shaking his head in exasperation.  
  
  ""Don't cancel the meeting,"" Reyes told the others. ""Just. . . start without me. "" He glanced over his shoulder, his gaze starting in the sky and falling slowly. Night's sinister canvas still waited, beckoning him to finally leap. ""I'll be down in a few. ""  
  
  Paris's lips twitched. ""Down. Funny. Maybe I'll meet you down there and we can play Hide-the-Pancreas again. Forcing you to completely regenerate rather than simply heal always amuses me  
. ""  
  
  Even Lucien grinned at that.  
  
  ""Oh, oh, I wanna play! Can I hide his liver this time?""  
  
  At the sound of Anya's sultry voice, Reyes stifled a groan.  
  
  The white-haired goddess of Anarchy rushed through the doorway and threw herself into Lucien's now-open arms, her strawberry fragrance drifting on the ever-increasing wind. The pair cooed and cuddled like lovesick idiots for an eternity, lost in each other, the world around them forgotten.  
  
  It had taken Reyes a while to warm to the woman. She belonged in Olympus, home to the very beings he reviled - strike one. She left chaos in her wake, something as natural to her as breathing - strike two. But in the end, she had aided every warrior here, and had blessed Lucien with a happiness Reyes could only imagine.  
  
  Sabin coughed.  
  
  Paris whistled, though the sound of it was strained.  
  
  A pang of envy tightened Reyes's chest, squeezing at the heart that would soon stop beating. The heart he wished he did not possess. Without one, he would not have wanted Danika even though he knew he couldn't have her.  
  
  Didn't matter, he supposed. She would never want him in return. Most women did not appreciate his particular brand of pleasure and sweet, angelic Danika would hate it more than most. Even being near him had terrified her.  
  
  Perhaps, though, he could have won her over, seduced her, softened her toward him. Perhaps. . . but he refused to even try. The women he bedded always succumbed to his demon, became drunk on it, addicted to its predilections. They developed their own need for pain, lashing out and hurting everyone around them.  
  
  ""Someone gather the others,"" Reyes said, sarcasm dripping from the words and hopefully hiding his inner agony. ""We'll make this a reunion. "" What was Danika doing right this second? Who was she with? A man? Was she cuddling against him as Anya was cuddling against Lucien? Was she dead, buried as Aeron was buried? His hands curled into fists, his nails elongating into claws, slicing skin and stinging beautifully.  
  
  ""The Darkest Pleasure""  
  
  ""You can shut it, Painie,"" Anya said, facing him. She burrowed her head in the hollow of Lucien's neck, blue eyes peeking through thick strands of pale hair. ""You're wasting Lucien's time, and that seriously irritates me. ""  
  
  Bad things happened when Anya was irritated. Wars, natural disasters. Reyes's weapons left in the rain to rust. ""He and I have already spoken. He has the information he desired. ""  
  
  ""Not all of it,"" Lucien said.  
  
  ""Tell him or I'll push you,"" Anya said. ""And then I swear to the gods - bastards that they are! - that while you're recovering and unable to stop me I'll find your little girlfriend and mail you one of her fingers. ""  
  
  Just the thought caused a red haze to curtain his eyes. Danika. . . hurting. . . Do not react. Do not allow fury to swamp you. ""You will not touch her. ""  
  
  ""Watch your tone,"" Lucien told him, tightening his grip on his woman.  
  
  ""You don't even know where she is,"" Reyes said more calmly, marveling at how protective the once stolid Lucien was.  
  
  Anya smiled a secret smile.  
  
  ""Anya,"" he warned.  
  
  ""What?"" she asked, all innocence.  
  
  ""Aeron needs to be with us,"" Lucien said.  
  
  ""Aeron is no longer up for discussion,"" Reyes growled. ""You weren't there. You didn't see the torment in his eyes. You didn't hear the pleading in his tone. I did what I had to do, and I'd do it again. "" He spun away from his friends. Glanced down. The puddles were now undulating fiercely against the jagged rocks lining the ground. They were still beckoning.  
  
  Deliverance, they whispered.  
  
  Just for a little while. . . .  
  
  ""Reyes,"" Lucien called.  
  
  Reyes jumped.

CHAPTER TWO  
  
   
  
  ""ORDER'S UP. ""  
  
  Danika Ford caught the two steaming plates that slid across the silver warmer. One a greasy hamburger, hold the onions. The other a chili dog with extra cheese. Both were overflowing with heart-attack-in-the-making fries and wafting delicious scents to her nose, making her mouth water and her stomach rumble.  
  
  Last thing she'd eaten had been a bologna sandwich before bed last night. The bread had been crusty and the meat ripe. Sadly, she would have paid good money for another crusty, overripe sandwich just then. If she'd had any money, that is.  
  
  Three more hours till her shift ended, then she could eat again. Three feet-throbbing, backbreaking, limb-shaking hours. She wouldn't last. Don't be a princess. Chin up. Game on. You're a Ford. Built for strength and all that jazz.  
  
  Despite the pep talk, her gaze fell to the plates. She swiped her tongue over her lips. Maybe a nibble. What could it hurt? No one would know.  
  
  Her arm rose before she could stop it, her fingers reached. . .  
  
  ""I think she's stealing one of my fries,"" she heard a man whisper.  
  
  Another whispered back, ""What'd you expect from someone like her?""  
  
  Danika froze. For a moment, her appetite was forgotten and a million emotions swept through her. Sadness, frustration and embarrassment were the front-runners. This is what my life has become. From sheltered daughter to woman-on-the-run in a single bleak night. From well-respected artist to take-whatever's-dished waitress.  
  
  ""Like to say I'm surprised, but. . . ""  
  
  ""Check your wallet when we leave. ""  
  
  Embarrassment edged ahead of the other two. She didn't have to see the men to know they were watching her with hard, judging eyes. Three times they'd come to eat at Enrique's and all three times they'd given her self-esteem a good workout. It was weird, too. They never said anything harsh, always smiled and thanked her when she brought them something, but they just couldn't mask the distaste shining in their eyes.  
  
  She'd dubbed them the Bird Brothers, so badly did she want to flip them off.  
  
  Don't bring attention to yourself, her common sense piped up. These days, it was the only rule she lived by.  
  
  ""I better not catch you trying to sneak food again,"" her boss snapped. Enrique was the owner, as well as the short-order cook. ""Now, hurry up. Their food's getting cold. ""  
  
  ""Actually, it's too hot. They might burn themselves and sue. "" The plates were obscenely warm against her cold skin - skin she hadn't been able to warm in weeks. Even now, in the heat of the diner, she wore a sweater she'd purchased for $3. 99 at the thrift shop down the street. But to her consternation, the burn from the plates never seeped inside her.  
  
  Surely something good would happen to her soon. Weren't good and evil supposed to balance each other out? Once, she had thought so. Had believed happiness waited around every corner. Sadly, Danika now knew better.  
  
  Behind her, past the wall of windows that provided a mocking view into the pulsing heart of L. A. 's nightlife, cars whizzed and people strolled, carefree and laughing. Not too long ago, that was me.  
  
  Danika had taken the job here, working as many hours as possible, because Enrique paid her under the table, no social security number required. Cash, no taxes deducted. She could disappear at a moment's notice.  
  
  Was her mother living like this? Her sister? Her granny - if she was still alive?  
  
  ""The Darkest Pleasure""  
  
  Two months ago, the four of them had decided to take an extended vacation in Budapest, her grandpa's favorite city. Magical, he'd always said. After he died, they'd gone to celebrate his memory and finally say goodbye.  
  
  Biggest. Mistake. Ever.  
  
  They'd soon found themselves kidnapped and locked away. By monsters. Real, honest-to-God monsters. Creatures the Boogeyman probably searched his closet for before daring to go to bed. Creatures who sometimes looked human and sometimes didn't. Every so often, Danika had caught a glimpse of fangs, claws and skeletal faces underneath their human personas.  
  
  In a moment of luck, she and her family had been rescued. But she'd been captured again, only to be released unharmed. Unharmed but warned: Run, hide. You'll be hunted soon. If you're found, you and your family are dead.  
  
  So each of them had run. They'd split up, hoping they would be harder to find that way. They'd hidden, shadows their new best friends. Danika had first traveled to New York, the city that never slept, trying to lose herself in the crowds. Somehow, the monsters had found her. Again. But once more she'd managed to escape them, hitching nonstop to L. A. , each day making just enough money to survive and pay for self-defense lessons.  
  
  In the beginning, she and her family had maintained contact every day by calling and leaving disposable cell-phone numbers with trusted friends. Then Danika's grandmother had gone silent. No more calls.  
  
  Had she been found by the monsters? Killed?  
  
  Last time Danika had heard from her, her granny had arrived in a small town in Oklahoma. She had friends there, had known better than to travel anywhere familiar, but at her age had probably grown weary of running. Yet even those friends had not heard from her in weeks; Grandma Mallory had gone to the market and simply never returned.  
  
  Thinking about her beloved grandmother and the pain the woman might have endured caused grief and sorrow to well up inside Danika's chest. She couldn't call her mom or her sister and ask if they'd heard anything. They, too, had stopped checking in. For everyone's safety, her mom had said during their last conversation. Calls could be traced, cell phones confiscated and used against them.  
  
  Her eyes burned and her chin trembled. No. No! What are you doing? She couldn't think about her family now. ""What if"" would paralyze her.  
  
  ""You're wasting time,"" Enrique said, tugging her from her dark musings. ""Shake your ass like I told you. Your customers are waiting and if they send back their food 'cause it's cold, you're going to pay for it. ""  
  
  She wanted to throw the plates at him, but ""No attention!"" was screaming inside her head, so she just smiled and pivoted on her heels, ratty sneakers squeaking. Chin high, back straight, she marched toward the table with dread congealing in her stomach. Both men watched her with those hard eyes. They were clearly middle-class with their inexpensive clothes and average haircuts. Tanned and buff as they were, they could have been construction workers. If so, they hadn't come straight from a job. They were clean, their jeans and T-shirts unstained.  
  
  One had a toothpick sticking out from between his teeth and was rolling it from one side of his mouth to the other, the motions faster and faster the closer she came. Her hands were shaking from fatigue, but she managed to set the plates in front of each man without accidentally dumping the food in their laps. A lock of inky hair escaped her ponytail and fell down her temple.  
  
  Hands finally free, she hooked the strands behind her ear. BB - before Budapest - she'd had long blond hair. AB - after Budapest - she'd chopped it to shoulder length and dyed it black to alter her appearance. Another crime to lay at the monsters' door.  
  
  ""Sorry about the fry. "" Despite their clear disdain for her, these men were good tippers. ""I wasn't trying to eat it, just to keep it on the plate. "" Liar. God, she never used to lie.  
  
  ""Don't worry about it,"" Bird One said, unable to mask the slight twinge of irritation in his voice.  
  
  Don't send the food back. Please don't send the food back. She couldn't afford the cut in her pay. ""Can I get you anything else?"" Their cups were almost full, so she left them in place.  
  
  ""We're fine,"" Bird Two replied. Again, polite enough words but uttered in an unmistakably waspish tone. He waved one of the paper napkins and settled it on his lap.  
  
  She caught a glimpse of a small figure eight tattooed on the inside of his wrist. Surprising. Had anyone asked her to bet, she would have put big money on a dark-haired female with a bloody hatchet coming out of her back.  
  
  ""Well, holler if you need anything. "" She forced herself to smile, knowing she probably resembled a feral wolf. ""I hope you enjoy your m  
eal. "" Just as she was about to move away -  
  
  ""When do you take a break?"" Two asked abruptly.  
  
  Uh, what now? He wanted to know when she went on break? Why? She doubted he'd asked for romantic reasons, since he was still watching her with mild distaste. ""I, uh, don't. ""  
  
  ""The Darkest Pleasure""  
  
  He popped a fry in his mouth, chewed, then licked his grease-smeared lips. ""How about taking one tonight?""  
  
  ""Sorry. Can't. "" Keep smiling. ""I have other tables. "" She should have added: Maybe next time. Encouragement might have softened him at tip time. But the words clumped together in her throat, forming a hard knot. Go, go, go.  
  
  Pivot. They disappeared from view. Her smile - gone. Six quick strides and she reached Gilly, the only other waitress on duty tonight, who stood in front of the drink counter, filling three plastic cups with different sodas. Though Danika should've been checking on the patrons she'd used as an excuse only seconds before, she needed a moment to fortify her composure.  
  
  ""God save me,"" she muttered. She flattened her hands on the bar and leaned forward, cocking her hip. Thankfully, a half wall blocked her from the customers' view.  
  
  ""He won't. "" Gilly, a sixteen-year-old runaway - eighteen if anyone asked - flashed Danika a tired grimace of sympathy. They'd both been working fourteen-hour days. ""He's already given up on us, I think. ""  
  
  Such pessimism seemed wrong in someone so young. ""I refuse to believe that. "" Lying must have become second nature to her. Danika wasn't sure God cared anymore, either. ""Something wonderful could be days away. "" Yeah. Right.  
  
  ""Well, my something wonderful was that the Bird Brothers sat in your section again. ""  
  
  ""Who are you kidding? They smile at you as if you're the Sugar Plum Fairy and they smirk at me as if I'm the Wicked Witch of the West. I have no idea what I did to them or why they keep coming back for more of me. "" Second time they'd come in, she'd feared they meant to pull her back into the nightmare she'd just escaped. But they'd never revealed a monstrous side, so she'd eventually relaxed.  
  
  Gilly laughed. ""Want me to shank them for you?""  
  
  ""Now, Gilly, that would be a travesty. Shanking's a felony and cuffs are so not a good look for you. ""  
  
  The girl's smile slowly melted away. ""Don't I know it,"" she muttered.  
  
  Part of Danika wanted to tell her to go home; life with her mom couldn't be this bad. The other part admitted that life with Gilly's mom could indeed be much, much worse. The terrible things Danika had seen on these darkened streets, even in the short time she'd been here. . . women with deadened eyes selling their bodies. Beatings. Drug overdoses. Whatever Gilly's mother had done to drive the teenager to the streets had to have been severe.

We have two good friends who we will be living with, but I’d still like to find friends who have been through similar experiences to help guide me through this process, as my boyfriend already is established with his friends and has family here too. 

My hobbies include: reading, going to the gym, playing ACNH/ any other switch games, coffee, watching basketball (Kings 😭💜) , watching movies, hiking, baking, finding new recipes to cook, true crime and finding new experiences to explore. I’m pretty much an open book & am willing to try anything that looks exciting!

You can’t enter a single gift shop, motel, or museum without gaudy flyers advertising our “ghost tours” being shoved into your periphery on every kiosk.

Most of the stories are relegated to Lake Spectral, the biggest of the town’s lakes, but I’ve always felt a much deeper connection to Lullaby Lake, mostly because my Uncle Chung-Ho (all names in this story changed for privacy) ran the summer camp there, and I lived near it for my whole childhood.

But after my brother was born, dad got a job in Seattle, and we moved away for a while, only returning after I was sixteen.

The small town now thoroughly bored me. Staying at home wasn’t an option. Dad was always at work and mom moved back to Korea. So, having nothing better to do, my brother Ken was like a little gnat hovering around my head. Always asking me stupid questions or just generally invading my personal space.

I needed a summer job, and the local ‘haunted’ roller rink wasn’t hiring. Uncle Chung-Ho threw me a lifeline, though. Offered to let me be a lifeguard for the late afternoon shift. Even let me stay in a cabin in the camp so I could be my own man.

There were ghost stories about Lullaby, of course. Before I’d moved away there were rumors floating around school about kids who walked into the lake to find lost toys and then, themselves, became lost. When thinking back on those stories at the time, I wondered if it was a way to warn kids about the dangers of the lake. Drowning deaths weren’t uncommon in a lakeside town.

The first few weeks of the job were easy. The kids who grow up around the lakes already know how to swim, so I only really had to worry about the visitors.

A couple kids needed help sometimes. Nothing serious took place. A few fights over toys resulted in tears, and I had to break up violent water gun battles, but it was a chill experience overall.

I even got to spend an almost intoxicating amount of time with the other lifeguard, Bethany, without my kid brother trying to butt in. She was another Spectral Lakes native. Once, when I was on-duty, she hung out with me despite her shift being over. I kept fidgeting with my whistle as she talked and scarcely dared to look at her blue-green eyes.

“You’re lucky you started this year. Last year sucked bad,” she said. She pulled at her black pony-tail.

I watched a couple kids try to climb up on the giant log bobbing against the rope marking off the safe swimming area. They managed to gain holding on the slippery surface before the log slowly rotated, sending the kids laughing and splashing to their doom.

“What happened?” I asked. The whistle’s lanyard was tight around my fingers.

“A kid drowned. Snuck in after hours on a dare.” She adjusted herself on the wood camp chair. The peeling paint stuck to the bottoms of her forearms. “The morning lifeguard found him. He quit after.”

“Oh.” My finger went white, its circulation cut off. I untangled it from the lanyard. “Must have been awful to see.”

A few kids on the shore were trying to skip rocks, but kept throwing them way too close to the swimming area. I blew the whistle and got them to stop.

“Yeah. He told me the kid must have died the night before, but something was really weird about the body.”

I took a tentative glance at her. Her eyes looked far off, past the pine trees on the other side of the lake.

“What?” I asked.

“There were bruises around his ankles. Police said that his feet must have gotten tangled in debris.” A mosquito buzzed near her thigh. She didn’t seem to notice. “But that lifeguard told me they looked more like hand marks.”

“Chung-Ho never told me,” I said, brows raised. 

She shrugged. “Didn’t wanna scare you off, prolly.” She smiled at me. It was simple, almost put-on in order to lighten the mood. But still. I glanced away from her, cheeks red. 

It was good that I did. I noticed something. 

A blur of orange lurked under the water, near the border rope. A few brown fingers showed their tips above the surface before sinking down.

I jumped from the tower, grasping my rescue buoy and diving into the lake.

The water was freezing. I shouldn’t have focused on that in such a life-or-death moment, but I was used to the temperatures of Washington lakes, and this was unusually cold for a summer day.

I grabbed at the orange blur before me, fingers closing in on swimsuit material. I got a grip around a small arm with my other hand and dragged it up to the surface.

The kid emerged in a huff. I propped her up on the buoy and quickly towed her to land. She hacked up the water in her lungs, thankfully not having enough in there that she needed any more help with.

The other kids stopped what they were doing and watched with mouths agape.

“Mr. Choi? Is she okay!?” asked a friend of hers.

“HA! Katie can’t swim!” jeered one of the asshole kids.

Katie’s red eyes bloomed with scared tears. 

“You okay?” I asked.

“My Barbie’s gone… I dropped her and tried to get her back. She’s gone forever!” Before a fresh batch of wails erupted from her.

I looked down. Could have sworn her ankles looked red, too. But before I could get a better look, Bethany descended on her, waves of comforting words coming from her lips as she put an arm ‘round Katie’s shoulder.

”Do you want a Sonic popsicle? I got one in the freezer,” offered Bethany.

Katie wiped at her red eyes and gave a nod as she wheezed.

I reported the incident to her parents and my Uncle. After what felt like hours of my Uncle and I calming down her hysterical mother over the phone, it was twilight on the lake. I went to my little cabin (which wasn’t much more than a small bedroom and bath), and slipped out of my swim trunks.

”Oh, shit,” I said as I put my lifeguard gear away. 

My whistle was missing. It was a cheap little thing, but Uncle Chung-Ho was cheap about replacing stuff. I walked back out to the lake to comb the shore for it, but it was getting real dark and I figured I’d just find it in the morning, so I stopped.

After dinner, I settled into bed and felt a wave of exhaustion overtake me. I got a text from Ken about how he ate Takis that day and liked them. For some reason he kept using my dad’s phone to update me on random things.

Usually I’d play gatcha games or something before I slept, but I could barely keep my eyes open, so I just let myself drift off.

\---

I felt cold water all around me. My eyes seemed frozen shut, so my body just floated in blackness for a while.

I kicked my legs, hoping to get my head above water, but I had no idea where I was going, and there was something wet and slimy curled around my ankle. I screamed in surprise. Even after kicking vigorously, it just stayed firmly in place, as if it’d been tied there to anchor me to the lakebed. 

Lakebed. That was it. It must be a lake plant, and if it was, it was growing from the bed. So the opposite direction would be my ticket out of the water.

I tried to calm myself and bend down to pull away the weeds, but knew my breath wasn’t going to last much longer. My heartbeat thumped in my ears. The rubbery weed was tough to tear through, and my fingers refused to bend right in the cold. I kept trying to force my eyes to open, but they wouldn’t. The darkness grew more oppressive as air leaked from my lungs.

I felt around for the body of the weed and pulled myself down it like a reverse climbing rope. The sandy lakebed was under my fingertips. My nails dug into the roots, grains getting stuck under them. I tried planting my feet on the sand and pulling it out, but nothing seemed to work.

Things were getting desperate now. The more effort I used, the more breath left my body. The water around me started to feel like a vice pushing and crushing me inward even as my nerves numbed. My joints started to refuse my brain’s orders. I grew listless, consciousness fading. I begin to feel impossible things in my last moments.

I thought I could smell my mom’s cooking. But it was just water pouring into my nose. I heard her laugh. But it was just bubbles rushing into my ears and bloodstream.

In the still waves, my limp body floated for minutes. I thought I was dead. But I still heard a weak heartbeat through it all. Every pulse of blood in my limbs felt like a needle jamming life into a block of ice.

Something touched me. It was almost like hair. Or one of those sheer fabrics that people use to wrap bouquets. The thing gently washed across my shin, then again at my feet. Then it was gone. And I heard my whistle.

I knew it was my whistle, because my brother had banged it up and it never sounded quite right after that. But there it was, its sound echoing through the water. And that sound, somehow, got me to move.

I could move. It was impossible, but I could, despite my body being weighed down by the lake’s water that now filled it. The weed relaxed, freeing my leg. And next, I finally could open my eyes.

It was still extremely dark, but I could make out some of what was around me. I saw the awful weed that’d trapped me here. I saw the lakebed scattered with plantlife and litter. And at my feet was the most surprising thing. The toy Katie had lost.

It was a Barbie doll with a fabric mermaid tail. The fins must have been what brushed me earlier. Her painted face looked up at me, smile wide but eyes sad, like she missed her owner.

I picked her up. Despite the exceptionally more serious situation I was currently in, I somehow felt like I needed to return her to Katie. She didn’t want to be here.

The whistle screamed again. I turned my head to face the sound. It came from deeper in the lake. The lakebed curved downward into a darker valley.

I decided to follow the whistle. 

My lungs were full of water, and my feet walked on the lakebed like I was a spaceman on the surface of Mars. So clearly, this was a dream. *Why should I worry about getting to the surface now? May as well see where this goes.*

I tread through the ice-cold environment. The valley went deeper and deeper, through areas the moonlight struggled to pierce. Still, I wandered, guided by that eerie sound. 

To the left I saw an old toy diving ring. To my right, a sunk fishing dinghy. I stepped on a broken bottle as I walked, cursing to myself. My words were garbled as bubbles erupted from my mouth. A trail of blood floated up from my heel. Still, I kept walking.

Soon it was too dark to see. I stopped then. The full brunt of what was happening here was at the edge of crashing down on my psyche. 

A light was visible in the distance. Cold and blue. 

I walked toward it. 

I heard the whistle again. It was followed by a choir of whispering laughs.

Dark shapes were outlined in the light. Man-made structures. I couldn’t make them out yet…

The Barbie in my hand hadn’t changed expression, it was a doll, I told myself. But somehow, she looked scared. It’s stupid to admit, but I hugged her close to give myself even an ounce of comfort as that blue light grew brighter.

Amongst those dark shapes, I thought I saw something white moving. Flitting from one shape to the other. I strained my eyes to see more, but my sight, despite the light getting brighter, was blurring more and more.

The feeling of drowning began to overtake me again. I clutched the doll as I bent forward. I coughed violently, as if trying to hack the whole lake out of my lungs.

Darkness pressed in on my vision. The whistle’s cry cut off prematurely.

The last thing I saw before blackness overtook me was a white face highlighted in blue.

\---

I woke up with a lot more coughing. It felt like it took a half hour before I could properly breathe again. My bed was soaked, like I’d sweated out all the soda I’d drank yesterday. 

When I got the chance to look up, I noticed my door was unlocked. I quickly locked it and stumbled to the bathroom.

What a terrible night. I shoved my bedsheets into a bag. They really needed to be washed.

I walked out of my cabin and headed for the laundry. The lake was as beautiful as ever in the morning light, but I felt a sudden aversion when looking at it that I’d never experienced before.

Yawning, I continued down the shoreline in my sandals (which I could hardly feel with how numb my feet were), when a speck of hot pink caught my eye. 

A mermaid Barbie perched on the sand. Water lapped up at her fins. She smiled, her stiff plastic arms pointed up at the sky.

And beside her, almost dissolved amongst the sand, were bloody footprints leading out of the water.

I looked down at my foot. Blood had pooled at the bottom of my sandal.

\---

I didn’t want to go to my shift that day. I used the first aid station to patch up my cut foot, but I kept shivering whenever I caught even a glimpse of the lake now.

Of course, I didn’t tell Uncle Chung-Ho the real reason I didn’t wanna do it. I just blamed it on my injury.

”Well you can still walk, can’t you?” He said to me while I nervously stood in his office. “You can use your eyes? You can swim?” He gave me a look.

I shrugged.

”I could have used that cabin of yours to store more tubes. Now I gotta keep them in the cafe. You know how hard it is for me to make coffee when there’s 50 giant rubber inflatable donuts in there?”

”You said that kids don’t want coffee anyway, so the cafe’s only needed for the adult camp season.”

”Yeah, and who in here’s an adult?” He gave me another look as he pointedly unscrewed the lid of his thermos and took a long gulp of decaf. He wiped his chin and raised his brows. ”The least you can do for me is do your job with a little cut on your foot.”

”Yeah, yeah…” My eyes fixed themselves on the patchy carpet before I dared to speak the next words. “But... you know... hazard pay would be nice...”

Chung-Ho glared at me with the concentrated power only an uncle could. “Noah. Remember what happened right before you moved away?”

I shrugged, trying to figure out where this was going.

“The fancy playground I’d *just bought* went missing! The whole thing! I got it with a loan I’m still trying to pay off. Now you want to get paid? You don’t want me to go bankrupt, do you?”

I shrugged again, regretting saying anything about getting paid. The memory of that incident came back to me now. On reflection, it was really weird. The whole playground was stolen, the only bits remaining being some leftover screws and wagon wheel tracks that went straight into the lake. Police said there was only evidence of a singular thief, and that he’d worked through the night disassembling it and bringing the pieces onto a boat.

“No, Uncle Chung-Ho. I don’t want that. I was just joking.”

“Jokes should be funny, Noah.”

I walked out of his office, wincing even as I stepped lightly. 

\---

Already feeling sufficiently emasculated by the way I’d hugged that doll last night, I was desperate to hide my trembling when I took over Bethany’s shift later that day.

I failed.

”You alright, Noah?” She asked, looking me up and down after she’d descended the lifeguard tower.

”It’s kind of cold today, huh?” I responded, pressing my shivering hands to my sides.

”Not… really.” Bethany unwrapped a fresh popsicle, which was already dripping.

“Princess Seafoam!!” A sudden squeal mercifully ended the conversation. Katie spotted the Barbie poking out of my tote and immediately gave the doll what would have been a bone-breaking hug if it had been alive.

“Uh, yeah. I found it on the beach this morning,” I said, shifting my weight away from my cut foot.

”THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!” Said Katie, who jumped up and down. She wore her campground clothes, not her swimsuit. Probably not in the mood to get into Lullaby. I sympathized. 

“If you hadn’t saved her, she was gonna get taken by the weeds!” Katie said, shaking her head and petting the doll’s hair.

*Weeds?* I wondered, heart thumping. “What do you mean?”

“Lullaby weeds take toys down deep.” she said matter-of-factly. “Maybe the lake likes to play with them. I dunno.”

Before I could ask anything else, she ran off towards her cabin.

”Good on ya. That mermaid coulda drowned.” Bethany said. My shivers ceased as I looked at her warm smile. I climbed up the lifeguard tower with a salute.

There were a lot of kids out today. Coupled with the fear from last night’s... dream, it made the job much more stressful than usual. My whistle being gone, I almost lost my voice from yelling so much. My eyes kept darting from kid to kid, trying to make sure every head dipped underwater for a normal amount of time.

Bethany decided to stay with me again. I liked the company. But when she talked with me or tried to show me some videos on her phone, I kept my eyes on the water.

There was even a moment when she reached up and tugged on my trunks to get my attention, then offered me a Powerpuff Girls popsicle. I just smiled and accepted it without turning my head.

It took all my strength to keep this up, but I couldn’t let myself get distracted. Whenever I glanced away from the swimmers, my thoughts flashed back to the feeling of water surging up my nostrils and the heaviness that came with waterlogged lungs. I imagined finding the bodies of children floating up to the surface.

Shit. There. A kid way out was bobbing his head out of the water silently, barely able to gasp as he desperately whirled his arms.

Bethany immediately followed my gaze and leapt to her feet.

Before I could move, she said: “I got this. You played the hero yesterday.” She grabbed my rescue buoy and made a graceful dive into the water. 

I called everyone out of the lake. A mass of kids gave disappointed signs and made their way to the shore.

In the span of several tense seconds, Bethany swam over to the drowning kid. But before she could reach him, he sank under the water and didn’t come back up. Bethany saw him go down and took a deep breath, following after him.

Seconds passed.

And then more.

Then more. 

Something was wrong. I jumped forward, but somehow my trunks had caught fast on a nail head. My body lurched down, the threads broke, and I painfully landed at the base of the lifeguard tower. My shoulder ached. For a second I wondered if it was dislocated. I spat sand out of my mouth and stumbled to my feet before managing a beeline towards the water.

My shoulder crying in protest, I swam as fast as I could to the spot both of them had disappeared. 

Just before I went down, Bethany breached the water, gasping and sputtering. Her face was awash in fear.

“I can’t find him!”

I pulled goggles over my eyes and dove. Terror sunk its claws into me as the water overtook my head. I tried my best to push it all away as I frantically searched for the boy.

He’d been wearing black swim trunks, which were frustratingly hard to spot in a lake.

I went deeper until I found the silty bottom.

There. In the weeds.

A pale face shone between the green strands. Small bubbles of air burbled from its open mouth. Its lips were blue.

Muscles aching for air, I tore through the weeds until the boy’s small body was free. Propping him under my arm, I propelled myself off of the lakebed and shot towards the surface.

The next few minutes were some of the worst of my life.

Bethany called for Uncle Chung-Ho and the ambulance. While we waited for help, it was up to us to get this kid breathing again.

We’d screamed at the kids on the shore to go back to their cabins, but they didn’t move, just staring in horror at their friend’s blue skin.

CPR training forced itself to the front of my mind. All of my energy went into compressions. I didn’t want to break the kid’s sternum, but the water just wasn’t coming out.

I sang to myself, using it to keep time on the compressions while calming my own heart from stopping.

Every second felt agonizing.

His eyes didn’t move under his lids.

This was my fault.

I hadn’t been paying enough attention.

I was so overtaken by fear that I almost didn’t notice when he started coughing.

The kid retched out dirty lake water, turning on his side as bile burst from his throat and onto the warm dirt.

Seeing the color return to his face, I started to cry.

\---

My uncle congratulated me warmly. He was proud I’d saved another kid’s life.

I felt cold. Two close calls in a row was two too many.

Bethany didn’t talk much after the kid was handed over to EMTs. I could tell she was in a shock. Probably felt horrible that she had almost let him drown. She went home looking pale.

As I got back into my cabin’s bed, the sheets now clean and dry, I rubbed my sore shoulder while I waited for the pain meds to kick in. 

I wondered if it was possible for me to sleep after all that had happened. I slipped out of bed to make sure my door was locked. I stood there for a moment. Looked out my windows at the lake.

I closed the blinds.

My phone buzzed.

“wow im playing mario now. hes cool. i like the turtles -Ken” 

How much access did Dad let this kid have to his phone, anyway?

The rest of my messages were filled with notifications for new events in my gatcha games, so I tried to get my mind off of things by playing them a bit. But while my character rode around in search of pngs to gamble for, I soon slipped out of consciousness, the relaxing music taking me deep into the fathoms below.

\---

That blue light again.

I saw it before me. 

I was back under the waves, toes dug into the sand of the lakebed, standing right where I’d drifted off the night before. The sudden feeling of water seeping through every nook and cranny of my being flooded my senses.

I shuddered, which caused ripples of water to disturb the sand, pushing it back in gentle eddies.

The whistle sounded again. Much closer. The blue light and blackened shapes beckoned.

So I walked towards them. One plodding step at a time. And then, the shapes finally crystallized into identifiable architecture.

This was a little town. Well, not an actual sunken town. I’d seen pictures of those on the internet before and they were a lot bigger than this. Made up of normal buildings. This was something different. It almost looked like it’d been built here. Under the water. Not flooded.

There were several small buildings. Some with doorways barely taller than my legs. And all of them were ramshackle. Structures made of driftwood hammered together with clumsy hands. The biggest ‘buildings’, if you could call them that, were made from the hulls of upside-down boats. A few were modern speedboats and the like, but a lot were much older. Like an 1800s logging raft. Or a fishing dinghy. Doorways were carved out of them, and they were all decorated in some form or fashion.

One little hut had tiny shells stuck around the doorframe. Smooth large stones made for tiny pathways between houses. Another structure was lined with fishing nets braided into curious patterns. The bones of various fish stuck out of a boat’s hull like a gruesome mohawk.

Some of these buildings had large, misshapen balloon-like things tied to them, which floated a distance from the light so I couldn’t make out exactly what they were.

Lost toys were placed around as if this was their home. An old porcelain doll covered in lake moss stood at a shop counter as if she was preparing to sell her wares. Her hair floated in a cloud around her but the lack of a current made it as still as a picture.

I saw plastic construction toys near one hut. Broken G.I. Joes stuck in the sand like a battalion ready to shoot me. A chipped tea set with a lake crab curled under a teacup.

The source of the blue light was a large old fisherman’s lantern. The kind that’d be used to ward sailors from the lakeshore at night.

It illuminated the centerpiece of the little town. A playground. This was the only piece that wasn’t makeshift. It was a whole Costso playground with a slide and everything that was somehow sunk in the middle of the lake. 

This was Uncle Chung-Ho’s.

I started when I realized that someone was inside it.

Tiny white hands gripped the bars. I couldn’t identify the face of their owner. It was wreathed in darkness. A pink beaded bracelet circled one wrist.

My heartbeat was in my ears. Water clogged my throat. I tried to speak. No bubbles came forth this time. There wasn’t any air left in my lungs to produce them.

“Who--are--?” I managed. But I sounded too garbled to be anywhere understandable.

The hands moved. Slowly, they uncurled from the playground bars and slunk back into the gloom. Then, with a kind of unsteady, waving motion, one hand appeared again under the blue light.

It held my whistle.

I breathed lake water in and out. Each breath was longer and more painful than any on land. I stepped closer to the hand, though every nerve told me to run away. Where would I run to? This was a dream. It had to be. I needed to find out who was haunting it.

My fingers touched the ice-cold metal of the whistle.

The hand didn’t move. I couldn’t pull the whistle from its frozen fingers. And the closer I looked at them, the more I could see that they were swollen.

The hand pulled itself closer to its body. I was moved with it. A face appeared in the gloom, motes of silt floating about the dead skin.

All I could do was watch while bloated, misshapen lips pulled themselves over small teeth as a whispering girl’s voice pried itself in the folds of my brain.

“*Stop saving them*.”

\---

I awoke at the edge of the lake. 

It was just before dawn. The lake was completely quiet. I stood there for a moment, in shock, watching the water crawl up to touch my feet, as if beckoning me back down with it. Up... and back... up... and...

In the early morning light, it was hard to discern anything. But I started to see little shapes in the waves, gently swaying with the tide, bobbing up and pulling me back.

They looked like children’s fingers.

I staggered back from the shoreline as the full brunt of everything I’d been through hit me. I threw up silty water, my stomach’s contents making a mess of the beach chairs beside my cabin.

“S-son of a bitch...” I said between retches. 

All the water was finally out of my body, but I still felt the slimy pond algae mucking up my throat and nose. I retreated into my cabin and drank a few cans of soda to try and wash it down, then gargled a bottle of mouthwash. I showered and scrubbed every last part of myself I could find.

I still felt nasty inside. I sensed silt inside the crannies of my bloodstream. Sand in between the joints of my bones. It was like the lake itself had infected me totally.

I sat in the corner of my room next to my heater, my blanket pulled over my shivering body. Nothing warmed me up.

The hands of the clock ticked by. Lunchtime was coming soon. The first group would be heading to the lake for free time after they ate, where Bethany would watch them.

I thought of the whispered words I’d heard last night, and burst out of my cabin, heading for my Uncle’s office.

It took several lies to get him to shut down swimming that day. I insisted I’d seen teenagers sneak onto the property and throw used needles onto the beach. I also reasoned it was a good idea to keep the kids out of the water for now, out of respect for the incidents yesterday.

My uncle agreed, and announced the news over the PA system to the disappointment of the kids. He was impressed with my maturity, he said.

I didn’t feel noble. Just scared. 

Uncle told me he’d ask the janitors to take care of things when they came tonight. Didn’t know what I’d say to him when they didn’t find anything. How would I keep this up for even a few more days? Would I have to pollute the lake myself?

I said my goodbyes and started back to my cabin. 

On the way, I saw Bethany walk away from the lake dressed in her lifeguard swimsuit and a pair of sweatpants. I caught her eye and she sidled up to me.

”Bummer about the lake. We’re still gonna get paid, right?” she asked.

“You are. I get paid with food and shelter.”

”Is that legal?”

”According to Choi family law.”

She chuckled. But I could tell her heart wasn’t in it. She looked distracted. 

“By the way. Since you’re not doing anything right now…”

I stood up straight, my fingers tangling up with one another.

”…Could you do something for me?”

”What?”

”I need to restock the popsicle freezer. Your uncle doesn’t want to bother with it right now. But you’ve seen how much the kids like it. I mean, a dessert freezer right by the lake? It’s just so perfect, right, Noah?”

I gave a half-smile. “Is this request really for the kids, or just you?”

”Come on. I’ll pay you back.” She grinned. “Chung-Ho wants me to stay on-site even if I’m not ‘working’.”

I didn’t have a reason to stay at the camp anyway. The kids wouldn’t be swimming. Plus, getting away from it felt like a good idea, if only to try and stay sane. No excuses, I suppose…

”Alright. I’ll be back later.”

Bethany beamed. “Cool. And make sure to get SpongeBob ones.”

”Aye aye, captain.”

I didn’t have a car, but Spectral Lakes was small, so walking wasn’t a challenge. But my foot still ached, and it took about a half hour to get to the nearest crummy corner store. I leisurely scanned the shelves looking for ugly cartoon popsicles.

My phone buzzed in my pocket. I took it out and glanced at the screen.

”See u soon! -Ken”

My head tilted in confusion. What did he mean? I didn’t remember plans for him to come to the camp today.

Might have been a mistake. Or an old text that finally went through. I picked out a bunch of popsicles and swept them into my basket. I then was faced with the dilemma of how I was gonna keep them from melting in the long walk back. Hm. I added a bundle of ice to the order. Then a cooler. Then despaired at the state of my finances.

That’s when another text came.

”ur not here :( o well. beth is waching me -Ken”

Okay, so that first text wasn’t a mistake. Something about this made me start to feel nervous. My brother was at camp being watched specifically by a lifeguard, not one of the counselors. I didn’t like the sound of that. Did my dad drop him off with my uncle? If so, he wouldn’t be swimming today, right? Even if Bethany was watching him, she knew the lake was closed. She wouldn’t break the rules.

I tried to shake off my anxiety, but it wouldn’t go. The shivering feeling from yesterday started again. I had to go back. Now.

I left my filled up basket at the door to the chagrin of the shopkeeper and ran down the road towards the camp. 

Why was it so far away?

As I sprinted, the cut on my foot opened up again. My footsteps trailed blood as I went, but I didn’t care. My panic was rising and drowning out every other feeling.

One car stopped when it saw me and a concerned woman poked her head out the window, asking if I was okay. I managed to convince her to drive me to the camp, insisting it was an emergency.

She nodded, shocked, and we drove the remaining five minutes. She asked if she needed to call 911, but I told her it was a family matter.

I made a beeline for the lakeside. My head swiveled around like an owl as I tried to find Ken. I didn’t see him or Bethany anywhere.

My trembling fingers tried to type on my phone.

”Ken, where are you?”

My dad texted back: “I dropped him off with your friend Bethany. They’re going for a swim.”

My heart dropped.

I looked out on the water. The swimming area was empty, save for a single toy floating on the surface. Ken’s boat.

I waded into the water. This was something I’d done the past few nights, even if I hadn’t been conscious of it.

I knew where Ken was. I had to go get him.

My fingers pierced the water as I dove. I went deeper and deeper, pressure popping my ears. The lake that was inside me felt like it responded to being back in the water. Currents carried me to the lakebed. Air bubbled out of me. The lake took over, and darkness encompassed my mind.

\---

I stood where I’d appeared last night. A good distance away from the underwater town. The blue light remained there like a star in the deep lake. I charged forward through the muck, my steps disturbing the silt and flinging it up into the stillness.

I thought I could hear something in the town ahead. A choir of whispers. A giggle.

My muscles strained against the pressure as I urged them to go faster. I almost stepped on that broken bottle again. Biting my lip, I picked it up and hid it behind my back.

As the forms of the little buildings finally came into focus, I saw something that made my blood run even colder.

In front of the sunken playground was Bethany. She had a smile on her face and sat cross-legged on the lakebed. A teacup touched her lips as she mimed drinking from it. Her eyes looked almost glazed over.

It was horrifying. But the thing she played with was even more so.

Across from Bethany sat the corpse of a little girl. It was wrapped in lakeweed, which drifted about her swollen white face like tendrils of living hair. Her eyes were gone, picked clean by lake scavengers. Flesh sloughed off of her body like smeared dough. 

What was left of her mouth pulled into a mockery of a smile. A giggle traveled through the water as her adipocere-laced hands poured ‘tea’ into Bethany’s cup.

”Where’s Ken!?” I screamed at the two of them as best I could. Somehow my words carried in the water, despite my empty lungs. It almost felt like the lake itself carried my intention.

Bethany and the corpse’s heads turned to face me, wreathed in cold blue light.

“He’s not ready to play yet.” Bethany said. She stood up and placed herself in front of the corpse protectively.

”Bethany, what—what are you doing?”

She was quiet.

”I need my brother! Where IS HE?” I yelled.

Bethany’s ponytail spread out around her head in the gloom. It almost looked like a dark halo.

”My sister is lonely,” she said simply.

For the first time, I noticed, even through the layers of decomposition, that her and the corpse shared several traits. The black hair, the sharp brows, and… matching beaded bracelets.  

“How long has she been down here?” I whispered.

The corpse’s vacant eye sockets stared at me.

”We’re twins,” was all Bethany said.

I thought I could feel tears on my face, but the only indication of their existence was a bit of salt in the thousands of gallons of freshwater around me.

”Please. Where’s Ken?” I begged.

“He’s staying. He doesn’t want to leave. It’s nice here.” Bethany’s face was still.

”Why don’t *you* stay and keep her company!?” I yelled. “Keep my brother out of it!”

Bethany didn’t answer. Instead, the piercing whisper of the corpse’s words dug into my brain.

“She brings me new friends.”

The sentence sent a violent shiver down my spine. 

In the shadowy doorways of the huts, I glimpsed the wavering, twisting forms of other small bodies. Watching me.

There was a boy with weeds tangling his feet. He carried the handles of a jumprope. A girl with a fish darting between her empty ribs slowly pushed a toy car back and forth. 

The ‘balloons’ I thought I’d seen last night weren’t that at all. The bodies of more children were there, floating upside down with weeds around their necks like a hanging seen from the lake’s reflection. They drifted in the water. Whispered to one another. Used the weed to pull themselves downward to the lakebed like I’d done the first night I’d been drowned. 

They moved silently, all drawing closer to me while hugging toys desperately to their chests as if those were the last bits of humanity left to them.

The freshest body was a boy with a campground wristband on his arm. 

I couldn’t move. Or even think. 

That’s when I heard a whistle blow.

I looked around for the source of the noise. It came from the largest hut, made from the hull of a wooden boat.

I moved past Bethany, who grabbed my wrist and pulled me to face her.

”It’s too late,” she said. “Go home, Noah. Live. I like you.”

Her pale face moved closer to mine. Cold fingers touched my chin. Numb lips closed over my own.

I wrenched out of her grasp, squeezing so hard on her wrist that I heard a ‘crack’ resound in the darkness. She cried out and fell to her knees.

I didn’t look back, charging into the large hut and gasping at the sight within.

Ken lay on a bed of weeds. He was still, eyes bleary, but I could see a whistle tucked between his teeth. 

I hovered over him, my face twisted in pain, looking for any sign of life.

In the perfect stillness of the lake bottom, there were only two things I could hear. My own heartbeat.

And Ken’s.

I hugged him. Then propped him up against my side and swam out of the boat.

Tens of dead eyes watched us. I quickly swam up, kicking my legs as fast as they would go.

Hundreds of little fingers closed in around my vision. I swam harder and harder. The water filling me weighed me down, but my heart gave life, if even a little, and I just outpaced the corpses.

That’s when I felt the weeds begin to wrap themselves around us. The girl’s whisper slunk into my thoughts.

“Please don’t go.”

I wielded the broken bottle like a hunted cat swipes its claws. The glass tore away at the weeds one after the other. In my desperation, I cut my own legs, but it was worth it as we broke free and kept traveling upward.

“Noah...!”

Bethany’s fingers closed around my ankle. I cut them, too.

I only glanced behind me for a second, but in that glimpse, I saw Bethany reach out for me again, and miss, desperately trying to reach us even as her wrist flopped at her side and blood bloomed from her other hand. Her face was twisted in pain and fear.

When the corpses realized that their intended prey was escaping their grasp, they instead moved to the easier prey.

They needed *someone* to stay with them.

All I heard was a gurgling scream slowly fading away behind me as I swam up.

My brother and I burst from the surface of the lake. We were a good distance from shore, and it took some time for me to finally propel us onto it. The entire time, we got lighter and lighter as we coughed out the lake.

As soon as we touched the dirt, we crawled as far as we could manage before rolling onto our backs, gulping down the precious pine-scented air.

The sight of the sunlight no longer filtered through cold water warmed my shivering body. I turned to look at Ken, who I could tell felt the same. He started to cry, and I hugged him. I patted his back to help him out as the remnants of the depths dribbled from his mouth. Flashbacks of when I burped him as a baby came to mind. That protective feeling of holding my newborn brother mirrored my current emotions as clearly as the reflections on the lake’s surface.

“Thank God, thank God...” I said into his hair as I held him close.

He started to try and speak.

”I f-found your whistle…”

“I know. You did good.”

“I knew it was yours cause I broke it...”

“Yeah. That’s okay.”

“I didn’t wanna be down there.”

“I know. You’re out now. You’ll be okay.”

“They--they didn’t have Takis down there. I think it would have sucked.”

I laughed. “Yeah, buddy. You’re right.”

\---

All I told Uncle Chung-Ho the next day was that I was bored of the job and needed something that paid. He grumbled about it but I was let off the hook. Though, he did ask me a few times if I knew where Bethany went. She wouldn’t answer his calls. I told him I hadn’t heard from her either.

There was an investigation to find her, but nothing ever came up in the years that followed.

Ken doesn’t swim anymore, but besides that, he bounced back from what happened really well. He even started getting real good at biking. Resilience of youth, I guess.

I’m in college now, and decided to study in Korea. Stay with my mom and her family for a while.

Even now I can feel the lake when I’m across the world. I can sense the eddies of the sand move in the ripples of water. I listen to the lapping against the shoreline. Bethany’s laugh when she plays with her sister.

Sometimes I can hear when Ken throws old toys into Lake Lullaby.

He hopes it likes them.",10,1753118636.0,nosleep,1,0.92,False
1m5p2u7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1m5p2u7/explore_if_the_oxo_brew_9_cup_coffee_maker_review/,Explore if the OXO Brew 9 Cup Coffee Maker review lives up to expectations!,"The OXO 8710100 Brew 9 Cup Stainless Steel Coffee Maker made its way into my kitchen a few months ago, and I've been putting it through its paces ever since. As someone who insists on a good cup of coffee to kickstart my day, I was intrigued by the promise of precision brewing and a sleek design. While my experience with it has leaned positive overall, there are a few quirks that deserve attention. This is no ordinary drip coffee maker—it’s more like the coffee enthusiast's attempt at creating a barista-level experience at home.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing to catch my eye was the metallic finish and modern design. The combination of silver stainless steel and black elements gives it a premium, understated aesthetic that fits well in any kitchen. It’s a bit on the bulky side, though, measuring 8.3”D x 15”W x 17.2”H, taking up significant counter space. The double-wall stainless steel thermal carafe is not just functional; it adds to the overall esteem of its design while keeping coffee hot for hours. However, its weight—coming in at 10.5 pounds—makes moving it around a bit cumbersome. Though it feels sturdy and well-made, I did notice a tendency for fingerprints to smudge the steel surface, which requires frequent cleaning to maintain its pristine appearance.

**Precision Brewing Technology**  
Brewing coffee with this machine felt like stepping into a science experiment, but in the best way possible. The BetterBrew precision technology optimizes brewing time and temperature, keeping it between 197.6°F and 204.8°F, which coffee aficionados will recognize as the ideal range for perfect flavor extraction. What truly impressed me was the internal mixing tube. Every cup, from first to last, came out with consistent richness—no more bitter, bottom-of-the-pot sludge! The Rainmaker showerhead evenly disperses water across the coffee grounds, a feature I didn’t know I needed until I tasted the difference. However, despite these advanced features, the programmable dial interface came across as a bit dated. While it’s simple to set the wake-up timer or cup capacity (up to nine cups), the lack of a touchscreen felt like a missed opportunity in 2023.

**Ease of Use**  
Operating this coffee maker was unusually straightforward for a product with advanced features. The fully automatic mode allows you to set it up and walk away—a blessing when juggling a busy morning. Features like the freshness timer, which lets you know how long the coffee has been sitting, and the pause-and-pour option make it user-friendly for everyone, even for tech-averse individuals like my parents. Cleaning it, however, is where things get slightly frustrating; the carafe's narrow mouth doesn’t allow for easy hand-washing unless you’re blessed with smaller-than-average hands or own a long-handled brush. 

**Perks**  
- Temperature-controlled brewing ensures consistent flavor.  
- Programmable settings with wake-up timer simplify mornings.  
- Thermal carafe keeps coffee hot without burning it.  

**Critiques**  
- Fingerprints smudge the stainless steel exterior.  
- The carafe’s narrow mouth makes cleaning tedious.  
- On the heavier and bulkier side, limiting portability.  

**Target Audience**  
Given its features and the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) certification, this coffee maker is clearly aimed at anyone serious about brewing excellent coffee at home. This would not be my first recommendation for someone who just wants a simple machine to brew a standard pot. It makes sense more for individuals who value the intricacies of controlling temperature, brewing time, and flavor retention. I could also see it appealing to households where multiple coffee drinkers prefer different cup strengths thanks to its adjustability. However, its premium features come with a slight learning curve, so it might not be ideal for beginners.

**Product Contenders**  
Having also tested the Technivorm Moccamaster, I’d say the OXO Brew coffee maker holds up in terms of water temperature precision and flavor preservation. However, the Technivorm offers faster brewing and less complicated maintenance. On the other hand, machines like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew allow for more flexibility with K-Cup compatibility. The OXO Brew stands out with its thermal carafe, which doesn’t scorch coffee like warming plates used by competitors. However, it struggles to justify its size and weight compared to lighter, compact models like the Bonavita Connoisseur.

**Money’s Worth**  
The price positioning of this coffee maker is within the mid-to-premium range for home brewers. Its features—like SCA certification and precision temperature control—are undoubtedly value-adding for true coffee enthusiasts. That said, for those who just want a quick daily caffeine fix, the detailed brewing specifics may not justify the expenditure. From my perspective, it’s more of an investment for individuals who value premium coffee-making as a ritual rather than just necessity. You’re paying for quality, not frills, but whether it fits your budget or not depends heavily on how seriously you take your cup of coffee.

1m5p2eb,https://v.redd.it/4gh4ilwnh9ef1,[Breville Bambino] Bottomless Portafilter looks like a crime scene,"I've been using this Breville Bambino for a few years but been making a lot more lattes lately. I saw this bottomless Portafilter from Amazon recommended here, and figure I would give it a shot. I was hoping that it could help me get a better sense of how my pulls were.

As you can see, it looks like a coffee version of The Shining. I'm wondering if it's just because of how the Bambino works, which seems to be pulling the shots way too fast, (is it just it very good ?) or if I have a grind issue, or what. 

The espresso also tastes a lot more bitter through this Portafilter than the one that came with it.

Can we come back from this?","My boyfriend (32M) and I (29M) have been together for nearly a decade, since I was 18 and he was 21, and we’ve lived together in Chicago for most of that time. He’s the love of my life, my best friend, the person I want to come home to every day. But for the last few years, I’ve been stuck in a cycle of feeling sexually invisible to him, and it’s killing me.

Two years ago, I found out he’d been sexting other men, on Grindr, Sniffies, elsewhere. Not once, but regularly, over the course of years. As far as I know, he never physically cheated. But emotionally, it felt like betrayal. I confronted him, we both cried, he was remorseful, and I chose to stay.

The problem is that I don’t think I ever really recovered. And I don’t know if *we* have either. Our sex life now is basically non-existent unless I initiate, and even then, it often feels like he’s dissociating, focused on my pleasure, but not really present. He’s affectionate, with hugs, forehead kisses, and cuddles but it all feels desexualized. I can’t remember the last time he looked at me like he was aroused by me.

I’ve tried to tell him how unwanted I feel, how it’s chipped away at my body image and my self-worth. But whenever I bring it up, we fight. He says I’m obsessed with the past, that I overanalyze everything, that he’s not that same person anymore. Sometimes he’ll say “I love you. I want a future with you. Why isn’t that enough?” But it’s difficult when you’re sleeping next to someone who barely touches you unless asked and even then, it feels like a favor.

He’s been warmer since, more affectionate than usual, but not in a way that feels erotic or intimate. And I don’t know how much longer I can carry this quiet grief. I’ve even considered suggesting we open the relationship, but I don’t think he’s open to that. And I’m not sure I am either. I don’t want to hook up with guys I don’t know very well. I want to feel wanted. Ideally by *him.*

I’ve been trying to take care of myself by working out more, dressing better, trying to reconnect with the parts of me that used to feel attractive and sexy. But the damage runs deep. He used to make me feel beautiful, like I was the most important thing in the world to him. Now, I just feel like a convenient burden.

Our life together otherwise feels like it’s great. We’re both doing well in our careers, he’s a doctor and I’m an accountant. We spend most of our time together and genuinely enjoy it. We’re close with each other’s families. Sometimes I talk to his mom more than he does. We go on little dates a few times a week. We both go out of our way to make each other’s lives easier: picking up chores, buying coffee, covering bills in full that we’d otherwise split without being asked. He’s my best friend in the truest sense. And that’s what makes this so painful. I admire him so deeply. I can’t understand how someone I love so much, and who says he loves me and that his world revolves around me, could hurt me like this and still not appear to want to fix it.

So what do I do? How do I repair this without begging for scraps of affection? Is this something couples actually come back from? Or am I clinging to someone who’s already checked out? Has anyone *actually* rebuilt trust and desire after something like this?",1,1753118589.0,askgaybros,3,1.0,False

1m5p1ha,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1m5p1ha/the_accused_by_john_grisham_read_online_free/,The Accused by John Grisham Read online Free:,"Chapter 1  
  
  The accused was a wealthy man by the name of Pete Duffy, and his alleged crime was murder. According to the police and the prosecutors, Mr. Duffy strangled his lovely wife in their attractive home on the sixth fairway of a golf course where he, the accused, was playing golf that day, alone. If convicted, he would spend the rest of his life in prison. If acquitted, he would walk out of the courtroom a free man. As things turned out, the jury did not find him guilty, or not guilty.  
  
  This was his second trial. Four months earlier, the first trial had ended suddenly when Judge Henry Gantry decided it would be unfair to continue. He declared a mistrial and sent everyone home, including Pete Duffy, who remained free on bond. In most murder cases, the accused cannot afford to post a bond and stay out of jail while waiting on a trial. But because Mr. Duffy had money and good lawyers, he had been free as a bird since the police found his wife’s body and the State accused him of killing her. He had been seen around town—dining in his favorite restaurants, watching basketball games at Stratten College, attending church (with greater frequency), and, of course, playing lots of golf. As he waited on his first trial, he seemed unconcerned with the prospect of a trial and the possibility of prison. Now, though, facing his second trial, and with a new eyewitness ready to be used by the prosecution, Pete Duffy was rumored to be very worried.  
  
  The new eyewitness was Bobby Escobar, a nineteen-year-old illegal immigrant who was working at the golf course on the day Mrs. Duffy was murdered. He saw Mr. Duffy enter his home at about the same time she died, then hurry away and resume his golf game. For a lot of reasons, Bobby did not come forward until the first trial was underway. Once Judge Gantry heard Bobby’s story, he declared a mistrial. Now, with Bobby ready to testify, most of the folks in Strattenburg, who had been closely watching the Duffy case, were expecting a guilty verdict. It was almost impossible to find someone who believed Pete Duffy did not kill his wife.  
  
  And it was also difficult to find a person who did not want to watch the trial. A murder trial in the Strattenburg Courthouse was a rare event—indeed, murder was rare in Stratten County—and a large crowd began gathering at 8:00 a.m., just after the front doors of the courthouse opened. The jury had been selected three days earlier. It was time for the courtroom drama to begin.  
  
  At 8:40, Mr. Mount got his eighth-grade class quiet and called the roll. All sixteen boys were present. Homeroom lasted for only ten minutes before the boys went off to first period Spanish with Madame Monique.  
  
  Mr. Mount was in a hurry. He said, “Okay, men, you know that today is the first day of the Pete Duffy trial, round two. We were allowed to watch the first day of the first trial, but, as you know, my request to watch the second trial was denied.”  
  
  Several of the boys hissed and booed.  
  
  Mr. Mount raised his hands. “Enough. However, our esteemed principal, Mrs. Gladwell, has agreed to allow Theo to watch the opening of the trial and report back to us. Theo.”  
  
  Theodore Boone jumped to his feet, and, like the lawyers he watched and admired, walked purposefully to the front of the room. He carried a yellow legal pad, just like a real lawyer. He stood by Mr. Mount’s desk, paused for a second, and looked at the class as if he were indeed a trial lawyer preparing to address the jury.  
  
  Since both of his parents were lawyers, and he had practically been raised in their law offices, and he hung out in courtrooms while the other eighth graders at Strattenburg Middle School were playing sports and taking guitar lessons and doing all the things that normal thirteen-year-olds tend to do, and since he loved the law and studied it and watched it and talked about little else, the rest of his class was quick to yield to Theo when discussing legal matters. When it came to the law, Theo had no competition, at least not in Mr. Mount’s eighth-grade homeroom.  
  
  Theo began, “Well, we saw the first day of the first trial four months ago, so you know the lineups and the players. The lawyers are the same. The charges are the same. Mr. Duffy is still Mr. Duffy. There is a different jury this time around, and, of course, there is the issue of a new eyewitness who did not testify during the first trial.”  
  
  “Guilty!” yelled Woody from the back of the room. Several others chimed in and added their agreement.  
  
  “All right,” Theo said. “Show of hands. Who thinks Pete Duffy is guilty?”  
  
  Fourteen of sixteen hands shot upward with no hesitation whatsoever. Chase Whipple, a mad scientist who took pride in never agreeing with the majority, sat with his arms folded across his chest.  
  
  Theo did not vote, but instead became irritated. “This is ridiculous! How can you vote guilty before the trial has started, before we know what the witnesses will say, before anything happens? We’ve talked about the presumption of innocence. In our system, a person charged with a crime is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. Pete Duffy will walk into the courtroom this morning completely innocent, and will remain innocent until all the witnesses have testified and all the proof is before the jury. The presumption of innocence, remember?”  
  
  Mr. Mount stood in a corner and watched Theo at his best. He had seen this before, many times. The kid was a natural on his feet, the star of the Eighth-Grade Debate Team, of which Mr. Mount was the faculty adviser.  
  
  Theo pressed on, still pretending to be indignant at his classmates’ rush to judgment. “And proof beyond a reasonable doubt, remember? What’s the matter with you guys?”  
  
  “Guilty!” Woody yelled again, and got some laughs.  
  
  Theo knew it was a lost cause. He said, “Okay, okay, can I go now?”  
  
  “Sure,” Mr. Mount replied. The bell rang loudly and all sixteen boys headed for the door. Theo darted into the hallway and raced to the front office where Miss Gloria, the school’s secretary, was on the phone. She liked Theo because his mother had handled her first divorce, and because Theo had once given her some unofficial advice when her brother was caught driving drunk. She handed Theo a yellow release form, signed by Mrs. Gladwell, and he was off. The clock above her desk gave the time as exactly 8:47.  
  
  Outside, at the bike rack by the flagpole, Theo unlocked his chain, wrapped it around the handlebars, and sped away. If he obeyed the rules of the road and stayed on the streets, he would arrive in front of the courthouse in fifteen minutes. But, if he took the usual shortcuts, and raced through an alley or two, and cut across a backyard here and another one there, and ran at least two stop signs, Theo could make it in about ten minutes. On this day, he did not have time to spare. He knew the courtroom was already packed. He would be lucky to get a seat.  
  
  He flew through an alley, got airborne twice, then darted through the backyard of a man he knew, an unpleasant man, a man who wore a uniform and tried to act as though he were a real officer of the law when in fact he was little more than a part-time security guard. His name was Buck Boland, (or Buck Baloney, as some people whispered behind his back), and Theo saw him occasionally hanging around the courthouse. As Theo flew across Mr. Boland’s backyard, he heard a loud, angry voice. “Get outta here, kid!” Theo turned to his left just in time to see Mr. Boland throw a rock in his direction. The rock landed very close by, and Theo pedaled even harder.  
  
  That was close, he thought. Perhaps he should find another route.  
  
  Nine minutes after leaving the school, Theo wheeled to a stop in front of the Stratten County Courthouse, quickly chained his bike to the rack, and sprinted inside, up the grand staircase and to the massive front doors of Judge Gantry’s courtroom. There was a crowd at the door—spectators in a line trying to get in, and TV cameras with their bright lights, and several grim-faced deputies trying to keep order. Theo’s least favorite deputy in all of Strattenburg was an old grouchy man named Gossett, and, as luck would have it, Gossett saw Theo trying to e  
ase his way through the crowd.  
  
  “Where do you think you’re going, Theo?” Gossett growled.  
  
  It should be obvious where I’m going, Theo thought quickly to himself. Where else would I be going at this moment, at the beginning of the biggest murder trial in the history of our county? But being a wise guy would not help matters.  
  
  Theo whipped out his release from school and said, sweetly, “I have permission from my principal to watch the trial, sir.” Gossett snatched the release and glared at it as if he might have to shoot Theo if his paperwork didn’t measure up. Theo thought about saying, “If you need some help, I’ll read it for you,” but, again, bit his tongue.  
  
  Gossett said, “This is from school. This is not a pass to get inside. Do you have permission from Judge Gantry?”  
  
  “Yes, sir,” Theo said.  
  
  “Let me see it.”  
  
  “It’s not in writing. Judge Gantry gave me verbal permission to watch the trial.”  
  
  Gossett frowned even harder, shook his head with great authority, and said, “Sorry, Theo. The courtroom is packed. There are no more seats. We’re turning people away.”  
  
  Theo took his release and tried to appear as if he might burst into tears. He backtracked, turned around, and headed down the long hallway. When Gossett could no longer see him, he ducked through a narrow door and bounced down a utility staircase, one used only by the janitors and service technicians. On the first floor, he eased along a dark, cramped corridor that ran under the main courtroom above, then stepped nonchalantly into a break room where the courthouse employees gathered for coffee, doughnuts, and gossip.  
  
  “Well, hello, Theo,” said lovely Jenny, by far Theo’s favorite clerk in the entire courthouse.  
  
  “Hello, Jenny,” he said with a smile as he kept walking across the small room. He disappeared into a utility closet, came out the other side onto a landing which led to another hidden staircase. In decades past, this had been used to haul convicts from the jail to the main courtroom to face the wrath of the judges, but now it was seldom used. The old courthouse was a maze of cramped passageways and narrow staircases, and Theo knew every one of them.  
  
  He entered the courtroom from a side door next to the jury box. The place was buzzing with the nervous chatter of spectators about to see something dramatic. Uniformed guards milled about, chatting with one another and looking important. There was a crowd at the main door as people were still trying to get in. On the left side of the courtroom, in the third row behind the defense table, Theo saw a familiar face.  
  
  It was his uncle, Ike, and he was saving a seat for his favorite (and only) nephew. Theo wiggled and darted down the row and wedged himself into a tight spot next to Ike.  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  Ike Boone had once been a lawyer. In fact, he had once been in the same offices as Theo’s parents. The three Boones had survived a rocky partnership until Ike ran afoul of the law and got himself into trouble, big trouble. So much trouble that the State Bar Association revoked his license to practice law. Now, he worked as an accountant and tax adviser to several small businesses in Strattenburg. He had no family to speak of and was generally an unhappy old man. He liked to think of himself as a loner, a misfit, a rebel who dressed like an old hippie and wore his long, white hair pulled back into a ponytail. On this day he was wearing typical Ike attire—ancient sandals with no socks, faded jeans, a red T-shirt under a checkered sports coat with frayed sleeves.  
  
  “Thanks, Ike,” Theo whispered as he settled into his place.  
  
  Ike smiled and said nothing. He was to Theo’s right. To Theo’s left was an attractive middle-aged woman he had never seen. As Theo looked around, he noticed several lawyers seated among the spectators. His own parents claimed to be far too busy to waste time watching the trial, though Theo knew they were keenly interested in it. His mother was a well-respected divorce lawyer with lots of clients, and his father handled real estate transactions and never went to court. Theo would one day be a great courtroom lawyer, one who stayed away from divorce and real estate. Or, he might be a great judge like his pal Henry Gantry. He couldn’t decide, but he had plenty of time. He was only thirteen.  
  
  The jury box was empty, and because Theo had watched so many trials he knew that the jurors were not brought into the courtroom until everyone else was settled. There was a large square clock on the wall far above the judge’s bench, and at 8:59, the prosecutors appeared from a side door with their usual air of great importance. They were led by Jack Hogan, a veteran who had been hounding criminals in Strattenburg for many years. In the first trial four months earlier, Theo had been greatly impressed with Mr. Hogan’s courtroom skills, and for weeks afterward Theo had considered becoming a prosecutor, the man the entire town would turn to when a horrible crime had been committed. Mr. Hogan was surrounded by several of his younger prosecutors and investigators. They made quite a team.  
  
  Across the aisle, the defense table was deserted—not a single member of the Pete Duffy trial team was present. Just behind it, though, in the first row, Theo could see Omar Cheepe and his sidekick, Paco, a couple of thugs hired by the defense to investigate things and cause trouble. As the clock ticked and the crowd settled in, it seemed odd, at least to Theo, that only half the lawyers were present and ready to go. Judge Gantry believed in being prompt, and when nothing happened at 9:00 a.m. sharp, the crowd stared at the clock—9:05, then 9:10. Finally, at 9:15, the defense team entered the courtroom and took seats. It was led by Clifford Nance, a well-known trial lawyer, who, at that moment, looked pale and perplexed. He leaned over the bar and huddled with Omar Cheepe and Paco, and it was apparent that something was wrong.  
  
  There was no sign of Pete Duffy, who should have been sitting at the defense table next to Clifford Nance.  
  
  Omar Cheepe and Paco suddenly left the courtroom.  
  
  At 9:20, a bailiff stood and yelled, “All rise for the Court.” As he did so, Judge Henry Gantry entered from behind his bench, his black robe flowing after him. The bailiff went on, “Hear ye, hear ye, the Criminal Court of the Tenth District is now in session, The Honorable Henry Gantry presiding. Let all who have matters come forth. May God bless this court.”  
  
  “Please be seated,” Judge Gantry said, and the crowd, still in the process of rising, suddenly fell back again.  
  
  Judge Gantry glared at Clifford Nance and took a deep breath. All eyes followed his, and Mr. Nance looked even paler. Finally, Judge Gantry said, “Mr. Nance, where is the defendant, Peter Duffy?”  
  
  Clifford Nance slowly got to his feet. He cleared his throat, and when he finally spoke his rich voice sounded scratchy and defeated. “Your Honor, I do not know. Mr. Duffy was scheduled to be in my office this morning at 7:00 a.m. for a pretrial meeting, but he did not show. He has not called, faxed, e-mailed, or texted me or anyone on my staff. We have called his phone numbers many times but got nothing. We’ve gone to his home, but no one is there. We are, at this moment, searching for him, but it appears as though he has vanished.”  
  
  Theo listened in disbelief, as did everyone in the courtroom. A deputy stood and said, “Your Honor, if I may?”  
  
  “Proceed,” said Judge Gantry.  
  
  “This is the first we’ve heard of this. Had we been notified earlier, we could have begun a search.”  
  
  “Well, start looking now,” Judge Gantry said angrily. He was obviously upset at the absence of Pete Duffy. He rapped his gavel and said, “We’ll be in recess for an hour. Please tell the jurors to make themselves comfortable back there.” And with that, Judge Gantry disappeared through a door behind his bench.  
  
  For a moment or two the spectators sat in stunned disbelief, as if they might see Pete Duffy walk in any moment now if they simply kept waiting. Then there were whispers and light chatter, then movements as several stood and began milling about. No one left, though, because no one wanted to take the chance of losing a seat. Surely, Pete Duffy would arrive any minute, apologize for being late, blame it on a flat tire or something, and the trial would go on.  
  
  Ten minutes  
passed. Theo watched the lawyers slowly ease toward the center of the courtroom and engage in hushed conversations. Jack Hogan and Clifford Nance huddled as if to compare notes, both men frowning gravely.  
  
  “What do you think, Ike?” Theo asked softly.  
  
  “Looks like he skipped out.”  
  
  “What does this mean?”  
  
  “It means a lot of things. Duffy put up some real estate to secure his bond, to guarantee his appearance in court, so that property will be forfeited and he’ll lose it. Of course, if he has indeed skipped out, he’s not too worried about property here because he’ll spend the rest of his life on the run. He’ll be a fugitive, until they catch him.”  
  
  “Will they catch him?”  
  
  “They usually do. His face will be everywhere—all over the Internet, on Wanted posters in the post office and every police station in the country. It will be difficult to avoid capture, but there have been some famous cases of fugitives who are never caught. They usually get out of the country and go to South America or some place. I’m surprised. I didn’t think Pete Duffy had the guts to make a run for it.”  
  
  “Guts?”  
  
  “Sure. Think about it, Theo. The guy killed his wife and got lucky when the first trial ended in a mistrial. He knew that would not happen again, so he was looking at a lifetime in prison. Me, I’d rather take my chances on the run. He’s probably buried some money somewhere. Got himself some new papers, a new name, maybe a pal who’s helping. Knowing Duffy, he’s probably got some young woman hooked into his scheme. Pretty smart move if you ask me.”  
  
  Ike made it sound like a real adventure, but Theo wasn’t so sure. As the clock approached 10:00 a.m., he gazed at the empty chair where the defendant was supposed to be and found it impossible to believe that Pete Duffy had jumped bond, skipped town, and was now prepared to live the life of a fugitive.  
  
  Omar Cheepe and Paco reappeared and huddled with Clifford Nance. From the way they shook their heads, whispered urgently, and exchanged hard looks, it was obvious the situation had not improved. Pete Duffy was nowhere to be found.  
  
  A bailiff rounded up the lawyers and herded them into Judge Gantry’s chambers for another meeting. Several deputies were telling jokes near the jury box. The noise level was rising as the crowd grew restless and frustrated.  
  
  “I’m getting kind of bored, Theo,” Ike said. A few others had left the courtroom.  
  
  “I might hang around,” Theo said. His only other option was to return to school, empty-handed, and suffer through classes. The release from the principal plainly stated that Theo was excused from school until 1:00 p.m., and he did not want to return any sooner, trial or no trial.  
  
  “Are you stopping by this afternoon?” Ike asked. It was a Monday, and the Boone family rituals required Theo to stop by Ike’s office every Monday afternoon for a visit.  
  
  “Sure,” Theo said.  
  
  Ike smiled and said, “See you then.”  
  
  After he was gone, Theo weighed the pros and cons of the situation. He was disappointed that the biggest criminal trial in the recent history of Strattenburg had evidently been sidetracked, and that he would not get the chance to watch Jack Hogan and Clifford Nance go toe-to-toe like two gladiators. But, he was also relieved that Bobby Escobar would not be forced to testify and point the finger of guilt at Pete Duffy. Theo had played a big role in bringing Bobby to the attention of Judge Gantry during the first trial, and Theo knew that Duffy’s lawyers and his thugs, especially Omar Cheepe and Paco, were keeping an eye on him. Theo preferred not to have the attention.  
  
  In fact, as the clock ticked and the crowd waited, Theo decided that the sudden disappearance of Pete Duffy was a good thing, at least for him. Selfishly, he was pleased.  
  
  Two men behind Theo were having a disagreement. In low voices, they were arguing over the fact that Duffy had been allowed to post a bond. The first man said: “I’ll bet Gantry takes some heat for this. If he had denied bail, Duffy would have been locked up while he waited for his trial, the same as every other defendant charged with murder. No one gets bail in a murder case. Gantry caved in because Duffy has money.”  
  
  The second man said: “I doubt it. Why not allow a defendant to post bail and get out? He’s innocent until proven guilty, right? Why lock up a guy before he’s convicted? Murder or otherwise? You can’t punish a guy just because he has money. Duffy’s bail was a million dollars. He put up some property and nobody complained, until now, anyway.”  
  
  Theo tended to side with the second guy. The first one responded: “Until now? That’s the whole point. Bail is supposed to secure his appearance in court. Guess what? He’s not here. AWOL, flew the coop, over the wall, we’ll never see him again because Gantry granted bail.”  
  
  “They’ll find him.”  
  
  “I’ll bet they don’t. He’s probably in Mexico City right now, getting his face worked on by some plastic surgeons who got rich re-doing the eyes and noses of drug lords. I’ll bet they never find Pete Duffy.”  
  
  “I’ll bet you twenty bucks he’s back here in thirty days, in jail.”  
  
  “You got it, twenty bucks.”  
  
  There was a rustle of activity and the bailiffs sprang to attention. The lawyers streamed out of Judge Gantry’s chambers and took their places. The spectators scurried for their seats and became silent. “Remain seated,” a bailiff barked. Judge Gantry assumed his position on the bench. He rapped his gavel loudly and said, “Order. Bring in the jury, please.”  
  
  It was 11:00 a.m. The jurors filed into the courtroom and took their seats in the jury box. When they were in place, Judge Gantry looked sternly at Clifford Nance and said, “Mr. Nance, where is the defendant?”  
  
  Nance rose slowly and replied, “Your Honor, I do not know. We have had no contact with Mr. Duffy since ten thirty last night.”  
  
  Judge Gantry looked at Jack Hogan and said, “Mr. Hogan.”  
  
  “Your Honor, we have no choice but to move for a mistrial.”  
  
  “And I have no choice but to grant one.” Judge Gantry then turned and addressed the jury. “Ladies and gentlemen, it appears as though the defendant, Mr. Peter Duffy, has disappeared. He has been free on bond, awaiting this trial, and, well, he has evidently vanished. The sheriff’s department is conducting a search and the FBI has been notified. Without a defendant, we cannot proceed at this time. I apologize for the inconvenience, and, once again, I thank you for your willingness to serve. You are dismissed.”  
  
  One of the jurors slowly raised her hand and asked, “But, Judge, what if they find him this afternoon, or tomorrow?”  
  
  Judge Gantry seemed surprised by a question coming from the jury box. “Well, I suppose it depends on how he is found. Let’s say they catch him at a border, trying to sneak out of the country, then he’ll be brought back here to face additional charges. That would certainly affect his strategy at trial, so he would be entitled to a delay. But let’s suppose he’s found somewhere around here and has a valid excuse for not showing up this morning. In that case, I would revoke his bond, or bail, put him in jail, and reschedule the trial as soon as possible.”  
  
  This satisfied the juror and Theo as well.  
  
  “Court is adjourned,” Judge Gantry said, and pecked his gavel once again.  
 Theo waited and waited, and finally left when a bailiff was turning off the lights. He had no place to go but school, and he biked in that general direction. Two blocks away from the courthouse, a black Jeep Cherokee eased alongside Theo. Its passenger window came down, and Paco’s swarthy head leaned out. He smiled but said nothing.  
  
  Theo braked and they passed. Why would they be following him?  
  
  He was rattled and made the quick decision to duck through an alley and cross a backyard. He was half looking over his shoulder when a large man stepped in front of him and grabbed the handlebars of his bike. “Hey, kid!” he growled, now face-to-face with Theo.  
  
  It was Buck Baloney, breathing fire and ready for war. “Stay outta my yard, okay?” he growled, still gripping the handlebars.  
  
  “Okay, okay, sorry,” Theo said, afraid of getting slapped.  
  
  “What’s your name?” Buck hissed.  
  
  “Theodore Boone. Let go of my bike.”  
  
  Buck was dressed in an ill-fitting and cheap uniform with the words All-Pro Security stitched on the sleeves. And, he had a rather large pistol on his belt.  
  
  “Stop cutting across my yard, you understand?”  
  
  “I got it,” Theo said.  
  
  Buck let go, and Theo sped away without getting shot. Suddenly, he was excited about returning to school, and to the safety of his classroom.  
  
  Chapter 3  
  
  Theo checked in at the front office and returned his release form. His classmates were in fourth period Chemistry, and Theo wanted to avoid walking in late. Instead, he went to Mr. Mount’s tiny office, down the hall from his classroom. The door was open, and, luckily, Mr. Mount was at his desk, eating a sandwich and watching the local news on his laptop.  
  
  “Have a seat,” Mr. Mount said, and Theo sat in the only other chair in the office.  
  
  “So I guess you know,” Theo said.  
  
  “Oh, yes. It’s all over the news.” Mr. Mount slid his laptop over a few inches so Theo could have a better look. The sheriff was talking to a gang of reporters. He was saying that there was no sign of Mr. Duffy. They had searched his home and found nothing. Both of his vehicles, a Mercedes sedan and a Ford SUV, were locked and parked in the garage. Evidently Mr. Duffy had played golf, alone, late Sunday afternoon and was seen leaving the course by a caddy. He was in his golf cart and headed in the general direction of his home on the sixth fairway, the same route the caddy had seen him take many times after playing a round. At 10:30 on Sunday night, Pete Duffy spoke by phone to Clifford Nance, and, according to Nance, agreed to meet with his defense team at 7:00 a.m. sharp for a lengthy prep session.  
  
  Pete Duffy lived two miles east of town in a fairly new development called Waverly Creek, an upscale residential community designed around three golf courses and meant to offer its residents a lot of privacy. Entry and exit were monitored twenty-four hours a day by guards at gates, with surveillance cameras recording everything. The sheriff was positive Pete Duffy had not left Waverly Creek during the night through one of the gates. “There are some gravel roads leading in and out, and I suppose that’s where he went,” the sheriff speculated. It was obvious the sheriff had little patience with reporters.  
  
  He went on to say there was no indication, yet, of how Pete Duffy fled. On foot, bike, scooter, four-wheeler, golf cart—they had not been able to determine that. But, there was no record of Duffy owning a scooter, motorcycle, or other type of vehicle that required registration.  
  
  In response to random and thoughtless questions, the sheriff explained that (1) there was no evidence of an accomplice involved in the Duffy escape; (2) there was no suicide note, in the event he jumped from a bridge or some other dramatic stunt; (3) there was no evidence of foul play, as if an intruder, for some unknown reason, wanted to eliminate Duffy the night before he was to stand trial; and (4) so far, they had found no witness who laid eyes on Duffy after the caddy saw him drive away with his golf clubs.  
  
  The sheriff finally had enough and excused himself. The news station switched back to the studio, where a couple of anchors launched into a windy summary of what little had just been said by the sheriff.  
  
  “So where is he?” Mr. Mount asked, chewing on his sandwich.  
  
  “I can’t believe he would take off in the middle of the night on foot and through the woods,” Theo said. “What’s your theory?”  
  
  “An accomplice. Duffy is not the outdoor type, not a man who understands the woods and what it takes to survive. I’ll bet he slipped away from his house, after midnight when his neighbors were sound asleep, used a bicycle because he didn’t want to make noise, and rode a mile or two down a trail where his accomplice was waiting. They tossed the bike in the trunk of the car, or the back of a pickup, and away they went. He wasn’t due in court until 9:00 a.m., so they had a head start of seven or eight hours.”  
  
  “You’re really into this, aren’t you?” Theo asked, amused.  
  
  “Sure. And you’re not?”  
  
  “Of course, but I haven’t given it as much thought as you. Where is he right now?”  
  
  “Far away. The cops have no idea what kind of vehicle they’re driving, so they’re home free until more clues pop up. He could be anywhere.”  
  
  “You think they’ll catch him?”  
  
  “Something tells me they will not. This might be the perfect escape, especially if he has an accomplice.”  
  
  Mr. Mount was in his midthirties and, at least in Theo’s opinion, was by far the coolest teacher at the school. His father was a judge and his older brother was a lawyer, and he often talked of leaving the classroom and going to law school. He sponsored the Eighth-Grade Debate Team. Theo was his star, and so the two had developed a close friendship. As they watched the news on the laptop, both minds were spinning wild scenarios about what had happened to Pete Duffy. How had he really managed to disappear?  
  
  “I guess we’ll discuss this in Government tomorrow,” Theo said.  
  
  “Are you kidding? This town will talk of nothing else for the next two days.”  
  
  The bell rang and Theo was suddenly ready to leave. Lunch was only a twenty-minute break and there was no time to waste. The halls were instantly crowded as five sections of eighth graders hurried from their classrooms, to their lockers, and to the cafeteria.  
  
  The Strattenburg Middle School had been modernized a few years earlier, and one of the more popular improvements was the new lockers. They were wide and deep, and made of wood instead of the old noisy metal boxes that had lined the halls for decades. Keys were not needed because each locker had an entry panel similar to the keypad of a phone. Punch in your five- or six-digit secret code, and the door clicked open.  
  
  Theo’s pass code was Judge (58343), in honor of his beloved dog. He pulled open the door, and immediately knew something was wrong. Several things were missing. Theo occasionally suffered asthma attacks, which required him to use an inhaler. He kept one in his pocket at all times, and he kept a three-pack of reserves in his locker. These were gone, as was a blue and red Minnesota Twins cap he kept on a hook in case it rained. Two unused notepads were missing. His books were there, stacked on top of each other. He froze for a moment, staring into the locker to make sure he wasn’t dreaming, then glanced around to see if anyone (the thief?) might be watching. No one seemed to be paying attention to him. He shifted his books, poked around, and finally came to the conclusion that his locker had been broken into. He had been robbed!  
  
  Small-time thievery happened occasionally. The new lockers, though, with their advanced security system, had virtually eliminated such break-ins. He looked down the hall and up to a spot above a large wall clock. There was an empty bracket where a security camera had once been installed. The camera was gone because the school was in the process of updating its video-monitoring system.  
  
  Theo wasn’t sure what to do. If he reported the theft, he would spend the next hour or so in the principal’s office filling out paperwork. And, worse still, he would have to deal with a hundred nosy questions from his friends and classmates. As he walked to the cafet  
eria, he decided to wait, to think about it, to try and figure out how someone could learn his code and break in his locker. He could always report it tomorrow.  
  
  He paid two dollars for a bowl of spaghetti, a piece of cold bread, and a bottle of water. He sat with Chase and Woody, and the conversation quickly turned to the Duffy trial and disappearance. As they talked, Theo could not help but survey the cafeteria. It was filled with eighth graders, none of whom was wearing his Twins cap. As far as Theo knew, he was the only Twins fan in Strattenburg.  
  
  During Mr. Mount’s study hall that afternoon, Theo gave a quick description of what he’d seen in court that morning, then they watched the local news as the Duffy story continued to dominate every conversation in town. Still no sign of the fugitive. An FBI agent was interviewed and asked the community for leads. So far, they had no clues into his disappearance. Much was being made of the one million dollar bond he had posted to remain free on bail, and this led to several stories about his financial situation. A former business partner claimed to know Duffy well, and offered the opinion that he “. . . always kept a lot of cash . . .” stashed away in secret places. This juicy bit of gossip sent the local reporters into a frenzy.  
  
  After school, Theo checked his locker again, and things appeared to be fine. Nothing else had been taken. He thought about changing his pass code, but decided to wait. Changing the code was no simple matter because all codes were registered with the principal’s office. The school maintained the right to open any locker at any time, for good cause, but this was seldom done. On at least one prior occasion, Theo had failed to properly close his locker, and the following day was puzzled to find its door shut, but unlocked. This was not uncommon in the seventh and eighth grades because the closing mechanism required a student to press and hold the Close button for a full three seconds. Twelve- and thirteen-year-olds can get in a hurry, or get distracted, and fail to hold the button long enough.  
  
  By the time Theo left the building and walked to his bike, he had convinced himself that his locker had been vandalized, but not broken into. He vowed to be more vigilant.  
  
  Theo soon had another problem. He unchained his bike, wrapped the chain around his handlebars as always, and pushed off. Instantly, he realized his front tire was flat. He got off his bike, examined the tire, and found a small gash where someone had punctured the sidewall.  
  
  Theo was in the midst of an unlucky run with his bike tires. In the previous three months, he had collected two nails, a piece of glass from a soft drink bottle, a jagged piece of metal, and he had punctured two front tires on account of reckless riding. His father was not happy with this and when the subject of the cost of bike tires came up over dinner, things were tense.  
  
  This latest puncture, though, was no accident. Someone had deliberately stuck a sharp object into his tire.  
  
  He waited until his friends rode away, then began the humiliating journey downtown, pushing his bike along streets that now seemed much longer, wondering who would do such a thing to him, and trying to put this latest act of vandalism in the context of a day that had not gone well. The excitement of the trial had vanished; Omar Cheepe and Paco had followed him as he rode to school; Buck Baloney had almost hit him with a rock and then caught him the second time he dashed through his backyard; someone had vandalized his locker; and now this—a slashed bike tire that would cut deeply into his savings account.  
  
  Theo couldn’t help but take an occasional glance over his shoulder, certain that eyes were watching.  
  
  Gil’s bike shop was downtown, three blocks from the courthouse, on a narrow street lined with small mom-and-pop stores. There was a cleaners, a shoe shop, photo lab, bakery, a knife sharpener that owed Ike money for tax services, and a couple of delis. Theo took pride in knowing every owner. Gil was one of his favorites—a short, round man with an awesome belly that was always partially hidden by a thick work apron covered in dirt and grime. Gil sold bikes and he loved to repair them. His shop was jam-packed with models of every size and color, with the smaller ones hanging from large hooks in the ceiling and the fancier mountain bikes lined up in the front windows.  
  
  Theo rolled his through the front door, thoroughly defeated by the day. Gil was sitting on a stool by the back counter, drinking coffee. “Well, well,” he said. “Look who’s back.”  
  
  “Hey, Gil,” Theo said. “Another flat tire.”  
  
  “What happened?” Gil asked as he rolled himself off the stool and waddled over.  
  
  “Looks like sabotage.”  
  
  Gil lifted the handlebars, spun the front tire until he found the hole in it, and exhaled a soft whistle. “You make somebody mad?”  
  
  “Not that I know of.”  
  
  “Small penknife, I’d say. Certainly no accident. Can’t do anything with it. Theo, you gotta have a new one.”  
  
  “I was afraid of that. How much?”  
  
  “You should know the price better than me. Eighteen bucks. You want me to send the bill to your dad?”  
  
  “No, he’s fed up with me and my bike tires. I’ll pay for this one, but I can’t swing eighteen dollars today.”  
  
  “How much can you pay now?”  
  
  “I can give you ten tomorrow, and the rest in a couple of weeks. You have my word, Gil. I’ll even sign a promissory note.”  
  
  “I thought you were a lawyer, Theo.”  
  
  “Sort of.”  
  
  “Well, then, you need to do some more research. A person has to be eighteen years old before he can enter into a valid contract, including a promissory note.”  
  
  “Sure, sure, I know that.”  
  
  “Let’s just do an old-fashioned handshake deal. Ten bucks tomorrow, and the other eight bucks in two weeks.” Gil extended his dirty and chubby right hand, and Theo shook it.  
  
  Fifteen minutes later he was flying down Park Street, happy to be so mobile again, but still wondering if the day could get any worse. He was also debating about how much of his bad luck should be reported to his parents. The farther he got away from his vandalized locker, the less important it seemed. Theo could live with those losses, irritating as they were. The slashed tire was another story because it involved a weapon.  
  
  As he approached the law offices of Boone & Boone, Theo suddenly had a frightening thought. What if the same person had robbed his locker, then slashed his tire as well?

The kind of love where you share playlists, toothbrushes, and silent stares that say more than words ever could. He was warm. Solid. The kind of man who knew how I took my coffee and remembered the names of my coworkers. I really thought he was it. One night, I was folding laundry while he was in the shower. His jacket was heavier than usual. I reached into the inside pocket and pulled out a folded piece of paper, soft at the creases like it had been opened and reread a hundred times. It was a letter. In his handwriting. It started with: “I don’t know how to say this out loud, so I’ll write it down instead…” My stomach sank. It wasn’t to me. It was to someone named Aaron. He wrote about how he couldn’t live a lie forever. About how he was sorry for walking away. About how loving Aaron had been the realest thing he’d ever felt. I froze. I read it three times. Part of me wanted to scream. Part of me wanted to cry. But mostly? I felt sad. Not for me — but for him. For living in a cage for so long. For loving someone he felt he had to leave behind. He came out of the shower, smiling like nothing was wrong. I handed him the letter without a word. His face went white. And then he just said, “I never meant to hurt you. I just didn’t know how to be myself and be loved.” I didn’t yell. I didn’t throw anything. I just said, “Go be with him.” He moved out the next week. Months passed. And then I got a postcard.

No return address. Just a photo of two hands intertwined, with a note:
“Thank you for setting me free.”

It's also scalable. You can **grow muscle with minimal equipment** from the comfort of your garage or living room.

# 👥 Who This Is For (And Who It’s Not)

This isn’t for bodybuilders chasing trophies. It’s for men who want to **gain muscle after 50**, boost energy, and feel less like a rusted lawn chair.

If you’ve had injuries, hate gyms, or just want to **train safely at home**, this hits the mark. It's especially suited for guys over 60 who still want to feel capable—but without wincing through their workouts.

You will need dumbbells (up to 50 lbs), a flat bench, and a chin-up bar. That’s it. It all boils down to a **home workout for seniors** that respects your schedule and your knees.

# 🧪 Doug Was Keen to Give it a Go ...

Let me introduce you to **Doug H**, a former coworker from my health copywriting days who now runs a small boat repair shop near Oxnard.

Doug's in his early 60s, spends hours crouched over fiberglass hulls, and used to joke that the only muscle he still had left was in his coffee-pouring arm.

We reconnected over email last year, and he mentioned he was sick of feeling “soft and creaky.”

His knees bugged him after long days, his shoulders ached from years of manual labor, and gym culture just made him feel out of place.

So [I sent him the Old Man, Young Muscle program](https://theworldhealth.org/old-man-young-muscle-official) link and said, “No pressure—but I think this is exactly what you're looking for.”

Three weeks later, he texted: *“I’m sore in places I forgot I had. This thing is sneaky.”* 😄

Doug stuck with it, doing three sessions a week between client appointments. The **low-impact strength workouts** suited him perfectly—nothing jarring, just focused, strategic training that didn’t flare up his joints.

His only gripe? He wished the guide came in a more visual format. Doug's a visual learner, and flipping through PDFs on his phone wasn’t ideal in a dusty workshop.

But even with that minor hiccup, he swears he’s never felt stronger, more mobile, or more confident on the job. He’s even back to climbing into boats without bracing on the rail first.

Watching Doug reclaim his strength without pushing his body too far? Honestly, it made me believe in the plan even more.

# 📘 What About Version 2?

Doug later tried the second version too, which adds cable-based moves for variety and a few extra techniques. It builds on the first plan, not replaces it.

That one’s also laid out in a **PDF format**, and it expands the training style a bit for those who already know the ropes. Think of it as the sequel for the newly re-energized.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Phillies vs. Red Sox: A Rivalry That’s Less “Classical” and More “Clash of the ERA”**

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, and anyone still wearing “I ♥ NY” shirts in Philadelphia (shame on you), it’s time for the latest chapter in the storied, yet oddly unstoried, rivalry between the Philadelphia Phillies and Boston Red Sox. Buckle up, because this game is less *Field of Dreams* and more *Field of Calculated Risk*.

**Parsing the Odds: When Math Meets Mayhem**  
Let’s start with the numbers. The Phillies (-211) are the favorites, which translates to a 68.3% implied probability of winning. For context, that’s about the same chance of correctly guessing a stranger’s favorite color on your third attempt. The Red Sox (+191) offer a 33.3% chance, which is roughly the odds of surviving a casual game of Jenga hosted by a toddler. The total runs line sits at 8.5, but SportsLine’s model thinks we’re in for a *full-on feast* of 10 runs. If you’re betting Under, may I suggest investing in a time machine?

On the mound, Zack Wheeler (2.36 ERA, 154 Ks) vs. Walker Buehler (6.12 ERA, 7.3 K/9) is a mismatch so stark it makes a clown car look balanced. Wheeler is the real deal—a Cy Young contender with the ERA of a man who’s never met a batter he didn’t respect. Buehler, meanwhile, has an ERA that makes a leaky faucet look efficient. The Red Sox’s starting pitching right now is like a sieve that’s been told it’s “筛”-mazing.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Streaks, and the Eternal Struggle of Trea Turner**  
The Phillies’ Bryce Harper is on a two-game HR streak, which is less “hot” and more “controlled explosion.” Shortstop Trea Turner has hits in seven of his last 10 games, including three straight, which is about the same level of consistency as a coffee addict on their third cup. The Red Sox, meanwhile, are riding an 8-2 run, and their left fielder Jarren Duran is a statistical behemoth with 25 do

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Yankees vs. Blue Jays: A Slugfest of Stalwarts and Slight Edges**  
The New York Yankees (55-44) and Toronto Blue Jays (58-41) collide in a battle of AL titans, where home-run artillery meets batting-average wizardry. Let’s unpack this matchup with the precision of a stathead and the humor of a guy who once bet his lunch money on a horse named “Rainbow Rocks.”

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Batting Titles

The moneyline is a dead-even 1.93 for both teams, implying a 51.8% chance to win—about as exciting as a tie in chess if these rosters played that. The spread favors the Yankees (-1.5) but only just, while the total is set at a frugal 9.5 runs. Given the Yankees lead MLB in home runs (155) and slugging (.455), versus Toronto’s 12th-ranked run-scoring but best-in-baseball .260 average, this feels like a clash between a sledgehammer (NYY) and a Swiss Army knife (TOR).

Key stat to note: The Yankees win 58.1% of games they’re favored in, while the Blue Jays thrive as underdogs (56.6% win rate). Translation? New York’s “we’re the best” attitude translates to results, but Toronto’s “we’ll take it when we can get it” mindset is oddly effective.

---

### Digesting the News: Health, History, and Home-Run Hysteria

No major injury updates mar this matchup—phew! Aaron Judge (.353 BA, 36 HRs) is operating at MVP levels, a human missile launcher who’s basically a power hitter in human form. The Yankees’ offense? It’s like a buffet where every dish is “all-you-can-eat HRs.” Conversely, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. (.278 BA, 13 HRs) is having a solid but underwhelming season, which is like saying a luxury car is “solid” even if it’s missing a few spark plugs.

On the mound, Carlos Rodon (Yankees) vs. Kevin Gausman (Blue Jays) is a classic “ace vs. ace” duel. Rodon’s 2024 campaign was derailed by injuries, but he’s looked sharp in 2025, mixing a deadly sinker with the charm of a grumpy coffee barista. Ga

She has a good amount of friends who are riders from the studio, most around her age, that will hang out outside of class. In the fall, she did invite me to an outing for her birthday with a few other members.

1m5ov5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1m5ov5j/an_abundance_of_katherines_by_john_green/,An Abundance of Katherines by John Green:,"The morning after noted child prodigy Colin Singleton graduated from high school and got dumped for the nineteenth time by a girl named Katherine, he took a bath. Colin had always preferred baths; one of his general policies in life was never to do anything standing up that could just as easily be done lying down. He climbed into the tub as soon as the water got hot, and he sat and watched with a curiously blank look on his face as the water overtook him. The water inched up his legs, which were crossed and folded into the tub. He did recognize, albeit faintly, that he was too long, and too big, for this bathtub—he looked like a mostly grown person playing at being a kid.  
  
  As the water began to splash over his skinny but unmuscled stomach, he thought of Archimedes. When Colin was about four, he read a book about Archimedes, the Greek philosopher who’d discovered that volume could be measured by water displacement when he sat down in the bathtub. Upon making this discovery, Archimedes supposedly shouted “Eureka!” 3 and then ran naked through the streets. The book said that many important discoveries contained a “Eureka moment. ” And even then, Colin very much wanted to have some important discoveries, so he asked his mom about it when she got home that evening.  
  
  “Mommy, am I ever going to have a Eureka moment?”  
  
  “Oh, sweetie,” she said, taking his hand. “What’s wrong?”  
  
  “I wanna have a Eureka moment,” he said, the way another kid might have expressed longing for a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle.  
  
  She pressed the back of her hand to his cheek and smiled, her face so close to his that he could smell coffee and makeup. “Of course, Colin baby. Of course you will. ”  
  
  But mothers lie. It’s in the job description.  
  
  Colin took a deep breath and slid down, immersing his head. I am crying, he thought, opening his eyes to stare through the soapy, stinging water. I feel like crying, so I must be crying, but it’s impossible to tell because I’m underwater . But he wasn’t crying. Curiously, he felt too depressed to cry. Too hurt. It felt as if she’d taken the part of him that cried.  
  
  He opened the drain in the tub, stood up, toweled off, and got dressed. When he exited the bathroom, his parents were sitting together on his bed. It was never a good sign when both his parents were in his room at the same time. Over the years it had meant:  
  
  1. Your grandmother/grandfather/Aunt-Suzie-whom-you-never-met-but-trust-me-she-was-nice-and-it’s-a-shame is dead.  
  
  2. You’re letting a girl named Katherine distract you from your studies.  
  
  3. Babies are made through an act that you will eventually find intriguing but for right now will just sort of horrify you, and also sometimes people do stuff that involves baby-making parts that does not actually involve making babies, like for instance kiss each other in places that are not on the face.  
  
  It never meant:  
  
  4. A girl named Katherine called while you were in the bathtub. She’s sorry. She still loves you and has made a terrible mistake and is waiting for you downstairs.  
  
  But even so, Colin couldn’t help but hope that his parents were in the room to provide news of the Number 4 variety. He was a generally pessimistic person, but he seemed to make an exception for Katherines: he always felt they would come back to him. The feeling of loving her and being loved by her welled up in him, and he could taste the adrenaline in the back of his throat, and maybe it wasn’t over, and maybe he could feel her hand in his again and hear her loud, brash voice contort itself into a whisper to say I-love-you in the very quick and quiet way that she had always said it. She said I love you as if it were a secret, and an immense one.  
  
  His dad stood up and stepped toward him. “Katherine called my cell,” he said. “She’s worried about you. ” Colin felt his dad’s hand on his shoulder, and then they both moved forward, and then they were hugging.  
  
  “We’re very concerned,” his mom said. She was a small woman with curly brown hair that had one single shock of white toward the front. “And stunned,” she added. “What happened?”  
  
  “I don’t know,” Colin said softly into his dad’s shoulder. “She’s just—she’d had enough of me. She got tired. That’s what she said. ” And then his mom got up and there was a lot of hugging, arms everywhere, and his mom was crying. Colin extricated himself from the hugs and sat down on his bed. He felt a tremendous need to get them out of his room immediately, like if they didn’t leave he would blow up. Literally. Guts on the walls; his prodigious brain emptied out onto his bedspread.  
  
  “Well, at some point we need to sit down and assess your options,” his dad said. His dad was big on assessing. “Not to look for silver linings, but it seems like you’ll now have some free time this summer. A summer class at Northwestern, maybe?”  
  
  “I really need to be alone, just for today,” Colin answered, trying to convey a sense of calm so that they would leave and he wouldn’t blow up. “So can we assess tomorrow?”  
  
  “Of course, sweetie,” his mom said. “We’ll be here all day. You just come down whenever you want and we love you and you’re so so special, Colin, and you can’t possibly let this girl make you think otherwise because you are the most magnificent, brilliant boy—” And right then, the most special, magnificent, brilliant boy bolted into his bathroom and puked his guts out. An explosion, sort of.  
  
  “Oh, Colin!” shouted his mom.  
  
  “I just need to be alone,” Colin insisted from the bathroom. “Please. ”  
  
  When he came out, they were gone.  
  
  For the next fourteen hours without pausing to eat or drink or throw up again, Colin read and reread his yearbook, which he had received just four days before. Aside from the usual yearbook crap, it contained seventy-two signatures. Twelve were just signatures, fifty-six cited his intelligence, twenty-five said they wished they’d known him better, eleven said it was fun to have him in English class, seven included the words “pupillary sphincter,” 4 and a stunning seventeen ended, “Stay Cool!” Colin Singleton could no more stay cool than a blue whale could stay skinny or Bangladesh could stay rich. Presumably, those seventeen people were kidding. He mulled this over—and considered how twenty-five of his classmates, some of whom he’d been attending school with for twelve years, could possibly have wanted to “know him better. ” As if they hadn’t had a chance.  
  
  But mostly for those fourteen hours, he read and reread Katherine XIX’s inscription:  
  
  Col,  
  
  Here’s to all the places we went. And all the places we’ll go. And here’s me, whispering again and again and again and again: iloveyou.  
  
  yrs forever, K-a-t-h-e-r-i-n-e  
  
  Eventually, he found the bed too comfortable for his state of mind, so he lay down on his back, his legs sprawled across the carpet. He anagrammed “yrs forever” until he found one he liked: sorry fever. And then he lay there in his fever of sorry and repeated the now memorized note in his head and wanted to cry, but instead he only felt this aching behind his solar plexus. Crying adds something: crying is you, plus tears. But the feeling Colin had was some horrible opposite of crying. It was you, minus something. He kept thinking about one word—forever—and felt the burning ache just beneath his rib cage.  
  
  It hurt like the worst ass-kicking he’d ever gotten. And he’d gotten plenty.  
  
  two  
  
  It hurt like this until shortly before 10 P. M. , when a rather fat, hirsute guy of Lebanese descent burst into Colin’s room without knocking. Colin turned his head and squinted up at him.  
  
  “What the hell is this?” asked Hassan, almost shouting.  
  
  “She dumped me,” answered Colin.  
  
  “So I heard. Listen, sitzpinkler,5 I’d love to comfort you, but I could put out a house fire with the contents o  
f my bladder right now. ” Hassan breezed past the bed and opened the door to the bathroom. “God, Singleton, what’d you eat? It smells like—AHHH! PUKE! PUKE! AIIIIEEE!” And as Hassan screamed, Colin thought, Oh. Right. The toilet. Should have flushed.  
  
  “Forgive me if I missed,” Hassan said upon returning. He sat down on the edge of the bed and softly kicked Colin’s prostrate body. “I had to hold my nose with both fugging hands, so Thunderstick was swinging freely. A mighty pendulum, that fugger. ” Colin didn’t laugh. “God, you must be in some state, because (a) Thunderstick jokes are my best material, and (b) who forgets to flush their own hurl?”  
  
  “I just want to crawl into a hole and die. ” Colin spoke into the cream carpet with no audible emotion.  
  
  “Oh, boy,” Hassan said, exhaling slowly.  
  
  “All I ever wanted was for her to love me and to do something meaningful with my life. And look. I mean, look,” he said.  
  
  “I am looking. And I’ll grant you, kafir,6 that I don’t like what I’m seeing. Or what I’m smelling, for that matter. ” Hassan lay back on the bed and let Colin’s misery hang in the air for a moment.  
  
  “I’m just—I’m just a failure. What if this is it? What if ten years from now I’m sitting in a fugging cubicle crunching numbers and memorizing baseball statistics so I can kick ass in my fantasy league and I don’t have her and I never do anything significant and I’m just a complete waste?”  
  
  Hassan sat up, his hands on his knees. “See, this is why you need to believe in God. Because I don’t even expect to have a cube, and I’m happier than a pig in a pile of shit. ”  
  
  Colin sighed. Although Hassan himself was not that religious, he often jokingly tried to convert Colin. “Right. Faith in God. That’s a good idea. I’d also like to believe that I could fly into outer space on the fluffy backs of giant penguins and screw Katherine XIX in zero gravity. ”  
  
  “Singleton, you need to believe in God worse than anyone I ever met. ”  
  
  “Well, you need to go to college,” Colin muttered. Hassan groaned. A year ahead of Colin in school, Hassan had “taken a year off” even though he’d been admitted to Loyola University in Chicago. Since he hadn’t enrolled in classes for the coming fall, it seemed his one year off would soon turn into two.  
  
  “Don’t make this about me,” Hassan said through a smile. “I’m not the one who’s too fugged up to get off the carpet or flush my own puke, dude. And you know why? I got me some God. ”  
  
  “Stop trying to convert me,” Colin moaned, unamused. Hassan jumped up and straddled Colin on the floor and pinned his arms down and started shouting, “There is no God but God and Muhammad is His Prophet! Say it with me, sitzpinkler! La ilaha illa-llah!”7 Colin started laughing breathlessly beneath Hassan’s weight, and Hassan laughed, too. “I’m trying to save your sorry ass from hell!”  
  
  “Get off or I’m going there quite soon,” Colin wheezed.  
  
  Hassan stood up and abruptly moved to serious mode. “So, what’s the problem exactly?”  
  
  “The problem exactly is that she dumped me. That I’m alone. Oh my God, I’m alone again. And not only that, but I’m a total failure in case you haven’t noticed. I’m washed up, I’m former. Formerly the boyfriend of Katherine XIX. Formerly a prodigy. Formerly full of potential. Currently full of shit. ” As Colin had explained to Hassan countless times, there’s a stark difference between the words prodigy and genius.  
  
  Prodigies can very quickly learn what other people have already figured out; geniuses discover that which no one has ever previously discovered. Prodigies learn; geniuses do. The vast majority of child prodigies don’t become adult geniuses. Colin was almost certain that he was among that unfortunate majority.  
  
  Hassan sat down on the bed and tugged at his stubbly second chin. “Is the real problem here the genius thing or the Katherine thing?”  
  
  “I just love her so much,” was Colin’s answer. But the truth was that, in Colin’s mind, the problems were related. The problem was that this most special, magnificent, brilliant boy was—well, not. The Problem itself was that He didn’t matter. Colin Singleton, noted child prodigy, noted veteran of Katherine Conflicts, noted nerd and sitzpinkler, didn’t matter to Katherine XIX, and he didn’t matter to the world. All of a sudden, he wasn’t anyone’s boyfriend or anyone’s genius. And that—to use the kind of complex word you’d expect from a prodigy—blew.  
  
  “Because the genius thing,” Hassan went on as if Colin hasn’t just professed his love, “is nothing. That’s just about wanting to be famous. ”  
  
  “No, it’s not. I want to matter,” he said.  
  
  “Right. Like I said, you want fame. Famous is the new popular. And you’re not going to be America’s fugging Next Top Model, that’s for goddamned sure. So you want to be America’s Next Top Genius and now you’re—and don’t take this personally—whining that it hasn’t happened yet. ”  
  
  “You’re not helping,” Colin muttered into the carpet. Colin turned his face to look up at Hassan.  
  
  “Get up,” Hassan said, reaching a hand down. Colin grabbed it, pulled himself up, and then tried to let go of Hassan’s hand. But Hassan gripped tighter. “Kafir, you have a very complicated problem with a very simple solution. ”  
  
  three  
  
  “A road trip,” Colin said. He had an overstuffed duffel bag at his feet and a backpack stretched taut, which contained only books. He and Hassan were sitting on a black leather couch. Colin’s parents sat across from them on an identical couch.  
  
  Colin’s mother shook her head rhythmically, like a disapproving metronome. “To where?” she asked. “And why?”  
  
  “No offense, Mrs. Singleton,” Hassan said, putting his feet up on the coffee table (which you were not allowed to do), “but you’re sort of missing the point. There is no where or why. ”  
Think of all you could do this summer, Colin. You could learn Sanskrit,” said his dad. “I know how you’ve been wanting to learn Sanskrit. 8 “Will you really be happy just driving around aimlessly? That doesn’t seem like you. Frankly, it seems like quitting. ”  
  
  “Quitting what, Dad?”  
  
  His dad paused. He always paused after a question, and then when h e did speak, it was in complete sentences without ums or likes or uhs—as if he’d memorized his response. “It pains me to say this, Colin, but if you wish to continue to grow intellectually, you need to work harder right now than you ever have before. Otherwise, you risk wasting your potential. ”  
  
  “Technically,” Colin answered, “I think I might have already wasted it. ” Maybe it was because Colin had never once in his life disappointed his parents: he did not drink or do drugs or smoke cigarettes or wear black eyeliner or stay out late or get bad grades or pierce his tongue or have the words “KATHERINE LUVA 4 LIFE” tattooed across his back. Or maybe they felt guilty, like somehow they’d failed him and brought him to this place. Or maybe they just wanted a few weeks alone to rekindle the romance. But five minutes after acknowledging his wasted potential, Colin Singleton was behind the wheel of his lengthy gray Oldsmobile known as Satan’s Hearse.  
  
  Inside the car, Hassan said, “Okay, now all we have to do is go to my house, pick up some clothes, and miraculously convince my parents to let me go on a road trip. ”  
  
  “You could say you have a summer job. At, like, a camp or something,” Colin offered.  
  
  “Right, except I’m not going to lie to my mom, because what kind of bastard lies to his own mother?”  
  
  “Hmm. ”  
  
  “Well, although, someone else could lie to her. I could live with that. ”  
  
  “Fine,” said Colin. Five minutes later, they double-parked on a street in Chicago’s Ravenswood neighborhood, and jumped out of the car together. Hassan burst into the house with Colin trailing. In the well-appointed living room, Hassan’s mom sat in an easy chair, sleeping.  
  
  “Hey, Mama,” said Hassan. “Wake up. ” She jolted awake, smiled, and g reeted both of the boys in Arabic. Colin answered in Arabic, saying, “My girlfriend dumped me and I’m really depressed, and so Hassan and I are going to go on a, a, uh, vacation where you drive. I don’t know the word in Arabic. ”  
  
  Mrs. Harbish shook her head and pursed her lips. “Don’t I tell you,” she said in accented English, “not to mess with girls? Hassan is a good boy, doesn’ t do this ‘dating. ’ And look how happy he is. You should learn from him. ”  
  
  “That’s what he’s going to teach me on this trip,” Colin said, although nothing could have been further from the truth. Hassan barreled back into the room carrying a half-zipped duffel bag overflowing with clothes. “Ohiboke, 9 Mama,” he said, leaning down to kiss her cheek.  
  
  Suddenly a pajama-clad Mr. Harbish entered the living room and in English said, “You’re not going anywhere. ”  
  
  “Oh, Dad. We have t o. Look at him. He’s all screwed up. ” Colin stared up at Mr. Harbish and tried to look as screwed up as he possibly could. “He’s going with or without me, but with me at least I can watch out for him. ”  
  
  “Colin is a good boy,” Mrs. Harbish said to her husband.  
  
  “I’ll call you every day,” Hassan added. “We won’t even be gone long. Just until he gets better. ”  
  
  Colin, now completely improvising, had an idea. “I’m going to get Hassan a job,” he said to Mr. Harbish. “I think we both need to learn the value of hard work. ”  
  
  Mr. Harbish grunted in agreement, then turned to Hassan. “You need to learn the value of not watching that awful Judge Judy, for starters. If you call me in a week and have a job, you can stay wherever you want as long as you want, as far as I’m concerned. ”  
  
  Hassan seemed not to notice the insults, only meekly mumbling, “Thanks, Dad. ” He kissed his mother on both cheeks and hurried out the door.  
  
  “What a dick,” Hassan said once they were safely inside the Hearse. “It’s one thing to accuse me of laziness. But to malign the good name of America’s greatest television judge—that’s below the belt. ”  
  
  Hassan fell asleep around one in the morning and Colin, half-drunk on well-creamed gas station coffee and the exhilarating loneliness of a freeway in nighttime, drove south on I-65 through Indianapolis. It was a warm night for early June, and since the AC in Satan’s Hearse hadn’t worked in this millennium, the windows were cracked open. And the beautiful thing about driving was that it stole just enough of his attention—car parked on the side, maybe a cop, slow to speed limit, time to pass this sixteen-wheeler, turn signal, check rearview, crane neck to check blind spot and yes, okay, left lane—to distract from the gnawing hole in his belly.  
  
  To keep his mind occupied, he thought of other holes in other stomachs. He thought of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, assassinated in 1914. As he looked down at the bloody hole in his middle, the Archduke had said, “It is nothing. ” He was mistaken. There’s no doubt that the Archduke Franz Ferdinand mattered, although he was neither a prodigy nor a genius: his assassination sparked World War I—so his death led to 8,528,831 others.  
  
  Colin missed her. Missing her kept him awake more than the coffee, and when Hassan had asked to drive an hour back, Colin had said no, because the driving kept him going—stay under seventy; God, my heart racing; I hate the taste of coffee; so wired though; okay, and clear of the truck; okay yes; right lane; and now just my own headlights against the darkness. It kept the loneliness of crushlessness from being entirely crushing. Driving was a kind of thinking, the only kind he could then tolerate. But still, the thought lurked out there, just beyond the reach of his headlights: he’d been dumped. By a girl named Katherine. For the nineteenth time.  
  
  When it comes to girls (and in Colin’s case, it so often did), everyone has a type. Colin Singleton’s type was not physical but linguistic: he liked Katherines. And not Katies or Kats or Kitties or Cathys or Rynns or Trinas or Kays or Kates or, God forbid, Catherines. K-A-T-H-E-R-I-N-E. He had dated nineteen girls. All of them had been named Katherine. And all of them—every single solitary one—had dumped him.  
  
  Colin believed that the world contained exactly two kinds of people: Dumpers and Dumpees. A lot of people will claim to be both, but those people miss the point entirely: You are predisposed to either one fate or the other. Dumpers may not always be the heartbreakers, and the Dumpees may not always be the heartbroken. But everyone has a tendency. 10  
  
  Perhaps, then, Colin ought to have grown accustomed to it, to the rise and fall of relationships. Dating, after all, only ends one way: poorly. If you think about it, and Colin often did, all romantic relationships end in either (1) b reakup, (2) divorce, or (3) death. But Katherine XIX had been different—or had seemed different, anyway. She had loved him, and he had loved her back, ferociously. And he still did—he found himself working the words through his mind as he drove: I love you, Katherine. The name sounded different in his mouth when spoken to her; it became not the name with which he had been so long obsessed, but a word that described only her, a word that smelled like lilacs, that captured the blue of her eyes and the length of her eyelashes.  
  
  As the wind rushed in through the cracked windows, Colin thought of Dumpers and Dumpees and of the Archduke. In the back Hassan grunted and sniffled as if he were dreaming he was a German shepherd, and Colin felt the ceaseless burning in his gut, thinking, This is all so CHILDISH. PATHETIC. YOU’RE EMBARRASSING. GET OVER IT GET OVER IT GET OVER IT. But he did not quite know what “it” was.  
  
  Katherine I: The Beginning (of the Beginning)  
  
  Colin’s parents never considered him to be anything but normal until one June morning. Twenty-five-month-old Colin sat in a high chair, eating a breakfast of indeterminate vegetative origin while his father read the Chicago Tribune across their small kitchen table. Colin was skinny for his age, but tall, with tight brown curls that erupted from his head with an Einsteinian unpredict  
ability.  
  
  “Three deed on West Side,” Colin said after swallowing a bite. “No want more greenies,” he added, referring to his food.  
  
  “What’d ya say, bud?”  
  
  “Three deed on West Side. I want french fries please thank you. ” 11  
  
  Colin’s dad flipped the paper around and stared at the large headline above the fold on the front page. This was Colin’s first memory: his dad slowly lowering the paper and smiling at him. His dad’s eyes were wide with surprise and pleasure, and his smile was uncontainable. “CINDY! THE BOY IS READING THE PAPER!” he shouted.  
  
  His parents were the sort of parents who really, really enjoyed reading. His mom taught French at the prestigious and expensive Kalman School downtown, and his dad was a sociology professor at Northwestern University, just north of the city. So after three died on the West Side, Colin’s parents began to read with him, everywhere and always—primarily in English but also from French-language picture books.  
  
  Four months later, Colin’s parents sent him to a preschool for gifted children. The preschool said that Colin was too advanced for their school and anyway, they didn’t accept children who weren’t yet fully potty-trained. They sent Colin to a psychologist at the University of Chicago.  
  
  And so the periodically incontinent prodigy ended up in a small, windowless office on the South Side, talking to a woman with horn-rimmed glasses, who asked Colin to find patterns in strings of letters and numbers. She asked him to flip polygons. She asked him which picture did not fit with the rest of the pictures. She asked him an endless string of wonderful questions, and Colin loved her for it. Up until that time, most of the questions Colin had been asked centered around whether or not he had pissed himself, or whether he could please eat one more bite of the miserable greenies.  
  
  After an hour of questions, the woman said, “I want to thank you for your extraordinary patience, Colin. You’re a very special person. ”  
  
  You’re a very special person. Colin would hear this a lot, and yet—somehow—he could never hear it enough.  
  
  The horn-rimmed-glasses woman brought his mom into the office. As the professor told Mrs. Singleton that Colin was brilliant, was a very special boy, Colin played with wooden alphabet blocks. He gave himself a splinter rearranging p-o-t-s into s-t-o-p—the first anagram he remembered making.  
  
  The professor told Mrs. Singleton that Colin’s gifts must be encouraged but not pushed, and she warned, “You shouldn’t have unreasonable expectations. Children like Colin process information very quickly. They show a remarkable ability to focus on tasks. But he’s no more likely to win a Nobel Prize than any other reasonably intelligent child. ”  
  
  That night at home his father brought him a new book—The Missing Piece by Shel Silverstein. Colin sat down on the couch beside his dad and his small hands flipped through the big pages as he read it quickly, pausing only to ask whether “lookin’ ” was the same as “looking. ” Colin emphatically pushed the book cover shut when he finished reading.  
  
  “Did you like it?” his dad asked.  
  
  “Yup,” Colin said. He liked all books, because he liked the mere act of reading, the magic of turning scratches on a page into words inside his head.  
  
  “What was it about?” his dad asked.  
  
  Colin placed the book in his dad’s lap and said, “This circle is missing a piece. The missing piece is shaped like a pizza. ”  
  
  “Like a pizza or a pizza slice?” Smiling, his dad placed his big hands on top of Colin’s head.  
  
  “Right, Daddy. A slice. So the circle goes looking for his piece. He finds a lot of wrong pieces. Then he finds the right piece. But then he leaves it behind. Then it ends. ”  
  
  “Do you sometimes feel like a circle missing a piece?” his dad wondered.  
  
  “Daddy, I am not a circle. I am a boy. ”  
  
  And his dad’s smile faded just a bit—the prodigy could read, but he could not see. And if only Colin had known that he was missing a piece, that his inability to see himself in the story of a circle was an unfixable problem, he might have known that the rest of the world would catch up with him as time passed. To borrow from another story he memorized but didn’t really get: if only he’d known that the story of the tortoise and the hare is about more than a tortoise and a hare, he might have saved himself considerable trouble.  
  
  Three years later, he enrolled in first grade—for free, because his mom taught there—at the Kalman School, merely one year younger than most of his classmates. His dad pushed him to study more and harder, but he wasn’t the kind of prodigy who goes to college at eleven. Both Colin’s parents believed in keeping him on a semi-normal educational track for the sake of what they referred to as his “sociological well-being. ”  
  
  But his sociological being was never all that well. Colin didn’t excel at making friends. He and his classmates just didn’t enjoy similar activities. His favorite thing to do during recess, for instance, was to pretend to be a robot. He’d walk up to Robert Caseman with a knees-locked gait, his arms swinging stiffly. In a monotone voice, Colin would say, “I AM A ROBOT. I CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTION. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO THE FOURTEENTH PRESIDENT WAS?”  
  
  “Okay,” said Robert. “My question is, Why are you such a tard, Colon Cancer?” Even though Colin’s name was pronounced like call in, Robert Caseman’s favorite game in first grade was calling Colin “Colon Cancer” until Colin cried, which usually didn’t take very long, because Colin was what his mother called “sensitive. ” He just wanted to play robot, for God’s sake. Was that so wrong?  
  
  In second grade, Robert Caseman and his ilk matured a bit. Finally recognizing that words can never hurt, but sticks and stones can sure break bones, they invented the Abdominal Snowman. 12 They would order him to lie on the ground (and for some reason he’d agree), and then four guys would take a limb apiece and pull. It was a kind of drawing-and-quartering, but with seven-year-olds tugging it wasn’t fatal, just embarrassing and dumb. It made him feel like no one liked him, which, in fact, no one did. His single consolation was that one day, he would matter. He’d be famous. And none of them ever would. That’s why, his mom said, they made fun of him in the first place. “They’re just jealous,” she said. But Colin knew better. They weren’t jealous. He just wasn’t likable. Sometimes it’s that simple.

Chapter Three: By All Accounts

 

Wednesday morning, Leila walked through the halls of the Harmony Hillside. The book club meeting was more fun than she could’ve imagined. Laura from down the street brought some extra bottles of wine and the girls drank them down within an hour. The rest of the meeting was spent laughing until they cried at the others' predictions. Leila, in fact, laughed the hardest; her sides were still sore. Camilla had suggested, jokingly, that the love triangle would end with Olivia (the protagonist) getting with her elderly, bald, handlebar-mustached gardener, as opposed to the handsome, brooding, and tall Frenchman or her adorable, romantic, well-meaning childhood best friend. This joke had the group practically rolling on the ground.

Leila did suspect that Brenda caught on to the fact she had read ahead, when she wine-drunkenly misspoke and disclosed some details she shouldn't have known a bit too well. As she pushed her cart through the blue halls, she smiled thinking of Camilla’s joke and debated to herself about how she should go about throwing Brenda off her trail until the rest of the club caught up. 

Nonetheless it was an issue for next week; as of now she had already managed the kitchen cleanup, the second floor changing of sheets and wiping counters, she was halfway down the third floor. The cart she wheeled was filled with old sheets and towels. It towered nearly a foot above her, blocking her sight of the rest of the hallway but she knew these halls better than her own apartment, she didn't need to see much at all to do her job. Four doors down, eight more to go on this floor. She entered room 308. The client was out for the day, not checking out just yet, so she just checked the bathroom, finding a towel on the ground, she picked it up, throwing it into her cart and fetching a bright- still warm from the dryer- new one, and hung it neatly on the rack. She checked under the sink and there was more than enough toilet paper, she left that be. Going out into the main segment of the room, the client- who she would've guessed was a couple, given away by the male trousers dropped onto the pair of shoes on the ground, and a bra that was flung all the way across the room, hanging off of a chair. She left these items as-is and folded the rustled sheets, praying to not feel any wet spots on them. There were some paper cups, half filled with water and one with coffee on the nightstand, she threw these away along with some seemingly used napkins and set out three more cups in their place. Looking around the room, it looked halfway decent aside from the clothes strewn about. Halfway decent indeed, Leila often remarked how she was paid halfway decent so halfway decent would be how she worked. 

She closed the door behind her as she re-entered the hall. She pushed her cart to the next room, she knocked and called “Housekeeping!” and waited a bit. No response, so she tried the door, locked. She held an ear to the door. She’d worked this job long enough to know no response didn't always mean empty: some folks weren’t always awake by the time she came by. Some folks were in the bathrooms with the water running too loud, others listened to music in some headphones. Some folks just couldn't hear. Some folks even made a game of it: not answering on purpose so she’d walk in, and they'd be laid out, private parts to the door, pleasuring themselves or waiting for her to join in. Some folks plain didn’t like answering but were quick to get angry if she barged in to do her job.

She heard a voice in the room, it seemed oddly distant, or rather quiet for the tone of the speech. It was muffled and she couldn't make out the words. It sounded like the radio, a political speech, the news, something of the sort. It wouldn't be the first time a client left a radio running while they were out, so she knocked again, ear still to the door. A small tumble came from within the room, then a “I’m in here!” a voice that sounded like a man ripped from sleep. Some more shuffling movements could be heard but this was enough to confirm she did not need to clean the room as of yet. She didn’t say a thing and continued down the hall.

Within room 309, the man was recovering from his startled fall from the wooden chair. His sleep was usually troubled, but the details were starting to fade now. Overall, the night went better than expected. He was usually haunted by night terrors, or sleep paralysis. He’d had this problem since childhood. Originally, it’d been frightening, he’d wake up from the paralysis feeling terrified the whole day, swearing he thought his life was coming to an end. In the bouts of paralysis, he never saw any creature or being like many said they did; he just lay in the darkness, unable to move no matter how badly he wanted to, as he felt something approaching. He didn't know what it was or what it could’ve looked like. All he knew was that it was getting closer, right outside the door, or coming down the hall, it had bad intentions, and he had no chance against it. But living with the issue so long, he found a way out of it, a method to cheat his way out of danger. When he was fourteen or fifteen or so, he learned that despite how awake and real it felt, he was actually still asleep during the paralysis, and if he was asleep: he could wake up.

He found that the reason most people, including himself, couldn't move or act during the terror was that they focused on body parts much too large. When one is in fear, he learned, they aim to move their arms to defend themselves, their entire body to get out of the bed, and their legs to run. But this was the wrong approach altogether, there was no chance his body would let him move these, no matter how much effort he put into it, so he figured he must trick his body. He was asleep, there was no real danger, and though he was still frightened by some approaching horror, the real enemy was his own body. So rather than these massive large limbs and motions people try to control, while the intruder got closer and closer, he would try to move the tips of his fingers, just a twitch, or even his tongue, on good days he could even focus on the things that are touching him, and those little movements were enough for his brain to separate the real sensation of moving and the still-dreaming state he was in, and he would wake up, breaking the sleep paralysis and thrusting him, relievingly, back to the real world.

But there was no paralysis last night, he figured it could've been because he slept in a chair rather than a bed, he didn't slip very deep into sleep. The cassette still played in the boombox, he had rigged the tape so that both sides played the same audio, therefore making it replay itself over and over, until he stopped it. He clicked it off, wiping sleep from his eyes and coughing into his elbow. *Hungry*, his stomach reminded him, but he walked to the bathroom to freshen up first. He saw a tube of toothpaste came new next to the sink- he was glad as he had forgotten his own. He brushed without looking up from the sink, coughing every couple brushstrokes.

 It usually took him a bit to wake up in the morning, but his adrenaline pushed all sleep and tiredness from his mind. *Eight days*, he told himself. He spit the last of the toothpaste out. His eyes were careful not to rise from the sink. He knew his reflection well, but he felt nervous to look into the mirror, he didn’t want to take the chance. He washed his face with the cold tap water, he felt the stubble like tiny bristles scrubbing his hands back. He coughed once more, hands on the side of the sink to settle himself. In his peripheral he could see his reflection, hunched over the sink just as he was, but he avoided looking at it- like a dog avoiding eye contact with a competing male. He huffed to himself and walked out the bathroom, as he flicked the switch, he could've sworn he saw the darkness jump out at him quicker than he had turned off the light. As he closed the bathroom door behind him, he felt a jump in his stomach, the hair on the back of his neck rising. It added a bit of pep to his exiting steps. 

As he stood in the curtain-muffled morning light, he shook his head at his own paranoia. He stood beside his still unslept-on bed, pulling the small snub-nose from the briefcase before setting the briefcase on the ground. He placed the gun on the nightstand, beneath the dirty yellow lamp. He got to his knees, clearing his throat as he did so, and reached under the bed. He pulled the bowl to him, he examined the rippling water, dipping a finger in it. He hadn't even slept in the bed, he reminded himself, before grumbling and pushing it back underneath. As he stood, his stomach called to him: *hungry*. He sat back in the chair, atop the stain, and produced a bag of homemade granola bars. He hit play on the cassette player and bit into the first bar. It strained his jaw, and broke like cement, powdery with hard chunks throughout.

The crunching of the bar made hearing the cassette impossible. He pulled the old newspaper from his back pocket. It was dated February 1976, he read through the headlines: New York City avoids bankruptcy when President Gerald R. Ford signed a $2.3 billion loan, beside it was: *John D. Ehrlichman found guilty of Watergate cover-up; sentenced to 30 months to 8 years in jail*, then *ABC, CBS, and NBC agree to create a 'family hour,' an early evening time slot free of violence and sex*, and off in the right corner *Priest dies in freak accident in Louisiana slum.* The man's eyes squinted over that headline. He read it again, shook his head, then read the fine print beneath it: *In a bizarre and tragic incident, Father Mark Kirkland, has reportedly passed away due to self-inflicted overeating. The 65-year-old clergyman, known for his jovial nature and love of community, was found unresponsive in the rectory of St. Louis Cathedral in New Orleans. Authorities believe that Father Kirkland succumbed to complications from consuming an excessive amount of food during a local party. Local doctors believe the priest may have been suffering from some psychosis-based eating disorder in his old age and stressful career. The unbelievable incident has left the local community in shock, with parishioners and neighbors expressing disbelief and grief over the loss of a beloved figure known for his homely smile and generous spirit. The church has announced plans for a memorial service to honor Father Kirkland's contribution to the community, highlighting his commitment to charitable causes and his enduring faith.* The man shook his head and audibly announced “What a world.” before flipping to the next page of the newspaper and taking another jaw-straining bite of the granola bar.

When he finished the bar, his stomach no longer called for food, he figured it was less because he’s full and more because it didn't want any more of the bars that sat like a brick in his belly now. Checking his watch, it was only eleven AM, he exhaled, and the puff turned into a cough. He stood from his chair, wiping crumbs off his shirt and they landed atop the stain on the floor. A fly zipped past him and circled the crumbs. Looking around the room, he figured he saw the shadows jump out of sight as he turned his head; something or things just narrowly avoiding his gaze, but he saw their aftereffects, just quick enough to not be seen directly. The cassette played, the only noise in the room, giving a ghostly effect, for the voice that played was the voice of the priest that died in New Orleans, just two weeks ago.

Matt shuddered, he was tempted to shut the cassette off, listening to the voice of a dead man was ghastly, unnatural, but he couldn’t. He changed clothes as the recording repeated “-us… Amen. Heavenly Father, in your sovereign reign and boundless-” Laying now in bed, looking up at the beige ceiling, he breathed in and out slowly, hands resting on his stomach, waiting, but nothing ever did come that day.",2,1753118068.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

But let's see what the community has to say... Sorry this will be a long one.

I broke up with my boyfriend of 1.5 years two weeks ago. He is still living in my house and is about to move out in a couple days, and I'm really sad. Let me start from the beginning.

I met Jake (fake name) in a super weird way. I'm an astrologer and psychic (just bare with me if you don't believe in this stuff) who had been on a journey of self-love and healing for 6 years after an amicable divorce with my best friend. I was learning who I really was, and was typically enjoying my single hood. It was lonely at times, but I was learning so much about life, myself, the healing and psychic arts, and making a business out of it. My corporate job was booming too. Life was pretty good. I had a few small 1 - 3 month relationships every year or two, but really didn't focus on men for most of these years. I was living my best life with my girlfriends and group hangs. Everyone I hang out with is also psychic with their own side specialties (hypnosis, energy healing, counseling, etc), so I get a lot of support from them in this realm. I had many readings from my friends about the next man who was coming. A lot of what they said was spot on. He'd be really into the ocean, I'd meet him around red bricks, he'd be extremely masculine but like a runner's body, would be tall, help around the house, have 2 kids, etc. When I met Jake and we got to know each other, I met him at a cafe that had red bricks on the walkway, he was extremely masculine and muscular but in a thinner way, used to live in Florida and swim far out to the buoys each day, was 5'11"" tall, he built all kinds of stuff for me around my house, had 2 grown kids, etc. 

So before meeting him, I'm minding my own damn business and living in peace. One Friday night I'm laying in bed and just hear the words ""Online Dating"" in my ear. I knew it was Spirit, as it talks to me like that, like a thought in my head, but an idea that isn't my own. And I just blurted out ""F#ck that"" (lol). Online dating had not been kind to me, and I had deactivated my Facebook dating profile years earlier. So I rolled over and tried going back to sleep. I couldn't. So I huffed and reactivated the profile, updated a couple things like pictures and what I was looking for, and posted. Within 5 minutes Jake and I matched and we immediately started talking. I was super nervous because I ususally go for more cute nerdy guys, but Jake was the typical hot jock looking guy. Way too cool for me... But what's funny is this was the exact weekend I had been looking at in my astrological chart a year or two earlier for possibly meeting someone special. So....interesting. When we got to know each other a little bit I asked him for his chart details, I plugged them in, and immediately saw our compatibility was higher than anyone I'd ever put in my app. Even higher than my ex husband who I never fought with. But I did see a lot of past life and karmic energy in our composite chart. I told him we'd have a lot of chemistry but it would also trigger the hell out of both of us if we dated. Boy was I right...

I'm a pretty quiet person. A healer, a listener, gentle, kind. Everyone says I'm the nicest person they know...and most of my boyfriends tell me years later they messed up by letting me go, and apologize. So here's to my surprise when I start officially dating Jake and everything turns into a trigger and a fight, and I'm the constant asshole according to him.

The first time was a month into knowing each other and we finally slept together. I have a lot of watery energy in my chart, so I like sensual slow and loving love making...at least at first until I'm warmed up. The first time he went pretty rough and hard, and I didn't say anything. I did not finish. The second time he did the same thing and I tried to guide him to what I wanted (like I've done with literally every other boyfriend I've ever had with no problem) and he flipped out. Immediately stopped, got off the bed, put on his clothes, and walked out of the room while yelling. Saying that he's been with a lot of women and he's made them all cum, it was my problem and I needed to stop bossing him around like he didn't know what he was doing. Wtf? That should have been my first red flag to just end things right there. But yay past life crap that needs to be resolved...if you know, you know...trauma bonds. I'm almost 40 years old and this is the first one I've encountered. I understand now how women get trapped in abusive relationships and can't or don't leave for a long time.

So this was like almost a weekly or bi-weekly occurrence for most of our relationship. I am so exhausted you guys... The sex got better over time and he did apologize and do things slower for me at times. In the beginning he also said he didn't know if he was ready for a relationship (guys, I know...I feel dumb too. Being psychic sadly doesn't always help yourself...it's about reading the heart of the client that let's you in...not as easy to do for yourself, so we still be doing stupid human things and messing our lives up lol. It's hard to get around our own emotions to see the logical steps). 

I stayed because he was SO weird like me and into the occult and spirituality and ancient Christianity and the same politics and 'conspiracy theories' and alternative health. Literally everything aligned with what I believed and did, and that is SO hard to find. But he had also had a really dark past. Almost his entire family died when he was 14 years old, and that left him incredibly scarred. He turned to drugs and got into crime. In his early 20's he got a felony for stealing back money he had leant to a friend but the friend wouldn't give it back to him, so he broke into his place to get it. He became an alcoholic and was in jail a few more times. But 7 years before he met me he finally got sober, went to AA for a long time, and got deeply into spirituality. But I can see his past and the darkness there was never fully purged. 

For the most part, he was kind to me. Him being 'super masculine', he wasn't huge into cuddling or making out or holding hands, but he would if I initiated it. I never initiated sex because he intimidated the f#ck out of me. And he got mad at me for this. So I attempted it a few times even though it felt weird as hell. I'd never felt weird to initiate with anyone else, so wtf was that? And the few times I did attempt, he usually said he wasn't in the mood. So I was almost constantly sad and definitely very confused. Gosh, seriously why did I stay? Wtf???

When I would bring up how I feel or things I wanted or needed, he would take it as an attack and often end up yelling at me, and then I'd cry. A couple times he even said I was acting like an asshole and wanting to change him when he accepted me for who I was and never tried to change me, even though I did things that annoyed him all the time. He just didn't bring it up. Again...never been yelled at by any previous boyfriends/husband in the last 20 years and definitely never been called an asshole by anyone in my life. So again, wtf?

He said it was normal to fight and yell in relationships and it happened in all of his past ones. It happens on tv (I'm not trying to have a toxic tv relationship, my dude...). He said I was way too sensitive. And I started to believe him. So I stuck it out, even though these fights would destroy my heart and I'd not be able to sleep. Completely wreck me for 24-48 hours every time, whereas he would immediately fall into a peaceful sleep.

So anyway, this is the (very long...sorry) setup to what happened in the last month and a half. 

In the middle of May I was unexpectedly let go from my job in Tech. First time in my professional career being fired. It was because the company was being sold and restructured, so nothing was my fault. But still, terrifying. I went into survival mode. Spent every waking moment updating my portfolio, resume, and applying to relevant jobs. My friends in the industry were scared for me because they said it had taken them 4 months to a year to find a job. Well, guess my manifestation abilities are pretty on-point, because I got a new job within 3 weeks with a Fortune 50 company and making more money too.

Jake suggested I also sell my house to take all the profits (I bought it for cheap during Covid) and pay off all my debt. I thought this was an amazing idea. So I contacted a realtor and got the process rolling. Within 4 days my house was under contract. Again...amazing manifestation? Because my realtor said the market had seriously slowed down and all of his other properties were just sitting. 

Oh, I should also take a moment to say he paid for all of our dates for the first 6 months. He also had a roommate in a city about an hour away, but his new job was closer to me, so about 6 months into the relationship he sort of just moved in with me without asking. And never paid me rent because the new job wasn't bringing in anything. His furniture was still at the other place, and I found out his roommate wasn't making him pay rent there if he wasn't staying there....so he was living for free. He was extremely frustrated because he has always had money apparently, until he met me, and then he was broke. To the point I stupidly leant him a couple thousand dollars over the next year and also co-signed a used truck for him so he could lower his monthly payments (dumb, I know, but thought we were on the marriage track). He's agreed to pay me back and we even have it in a contract, so we'll see I guess. I'm doing great monetarily after my house sells, so whatever...

So back to the present, I start l looking for a new place to rent, and only had a month to do it before the buyers take over my property! I took the two weeks before my new job started to drive all over the city looking at places, taking videos of the walkthrough, and showing Jake after work. You can't imagine how stressed I was. Job loss, job interviews, new job offer, onboarding, selling house, finding new place. And then Jake, even though he wouldn't be paying any rent until his money got better, was still super picky and kept turning down the places I liked. I was beyond stressed at this point. I have a full house of stuff I need to move, and know I needed a few weeks of wiggle room to move everything over to a new place. So I was running out of time fast. He wouldn't sign a lease for anything he didn't see in person, and his only day off was Wednesdays. And the places he did see in person were either already off the market by the time I tried to apply, or he hated them. I was between a rock and a hard place. He said he was nervous to sign a lease with me too and had to think about it because we had been having problems (ugh...), and if he could just live with me without being on the lease, he'd think about signing one a few months into it. I was like no...I could get found out and get evicted because of breach of contract. He fought me on that too and said people do it all the time. I'm sorry...in luxury townhomes where everyone is looking at you all the time? He called me a ""square"" that follows all the rules. Well...maybe but my life has been abundant because of it. 

He kept pushing so much that I eventually just broke and said we need to break up. Him not wanting to sign a lease with me for a rental where he wouldn't even be responsible for paying the rent (I'd write that into the contract), after I had already co-signed a car loan for him...it just hit me as all kinds of wrong and hypocritical. I felt betrayed. I felt like he had been coasting off of me for our entire relationship, belittling my needs, letting me cry and calling me too sensitive, and finally after a year and a half still not knowing if he saw a future with me....I had to finally stand up for myself and put an end to the bullshit. 

I don't think I'm an a\*hole for any of that. But AITA for not communicating I was going to talk to a realtor and just sprung it on him that I was selling my house? And within a week we broke up because of the drama, and then only had 3 weeks to get a roommate because he would not be living with me...? Was this enough time? I thought he would be living with me, but that turned sideways...because of his actions imo. I cried for days after breaking up with him. When things are good they're REALLY good, but when they're bad they're really bad. I was in love...or trauma bonded. I don't know. But I did NOT want to leave him. And he did not want to leave me. He is still calling me babe weeks after the breakup.

A few days ago he said the person he was going to live with had a black mold problem in their house. He came to me and begged me, asking to live with me in my luxury townhouse for a couple months until he found something else. The same townhouse he saw in person that he originally didn't like because there were a couple marks on the walls and the rooms were smaller than he liked. He said he would immediately give me $800 that night for rent. Wtf where did this money come from all of a sudden? When I held tight to my boundaries of him being an ex, and not just a friend I would help out, I said no I couldn't let him do that. He got mad and called me heartless. I was incredibly hurt and walked away. 

Another thing I didn't tell you? I'm letting him walk away with a lot of my stuff to help him out because his job still isn't paying very well yet. I'm giving him my gourmet coffee maker, my entire bedroom queen furniture set, my iPad that he's been using for work, the car I co-signed, and the $2,000+ he still hasn't paid me back yet. And I'm heartless...

Wtf petty potatoes... I feel like such a dumbass. I'm a great girl. I'm smart. But I feel I royally messed up with this guy. Let our karmic paths get too deep without learning the lesson early on (my karmic lesson in my chart is codependency and giving too much, letting others control me. I'm learning independence and boundaries), and now I feel like I'm buried under an avalanche of shit. But even then, I feel guilty for stressing him out and making him find somewhere else to live so quickly. He could have even gone back to his old roommate where his furniture is, but he said they got a yappy dog that hates him and craps everywhere, and he didn't want to live there either. So...sorry dude. You could have kept leeching off me (lol) and lived in luxury, but your attitude and pickiness has you now living in either shit or black mold AND having to pay $1,000 a month for it. 

But still, AITA for the timing of it? Lol...Jesus. He's stressed tf out now trying to get everything out by this week into a place he hates and can't really afford.",0,1753118056.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,6,0.33,False
1m5oroo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m5oroo,The 1994 Lotus Esprit S4 Turbo: The Enduring Underdog of Analog Exotics,"Among ‘90s analog exotics, the Lotus Esprit S4 Turbo often flies under the radar—but for those who know, it’s something special. By 1994, Lotus had refined the Esprit for nearly two decades. Originally penned by Giorgetto Giugiaro in the '70s, its iconic wedge shape evolved over time, and the S4 marked the first major restyling under designer Julian Thompson. The design softened just enough for the ‘90s, with integrated bumpers, a fixed rear wing, and more ergonomic updates inside.

The S4 also signaled a maturity in the platform. It retained Lotus’s signature 2.2L Type 910 inline-four engine but made the most of it with a Garrett turbo, charge cooler, and well-matched gearing. Power officially hit 264 hp, but the torque and light curb weight (\~2,900 lbs) delivered performance that could humiliate heavier, thirstier rivals. 0–60 in about 4.6 seconds, with a top speed of 168 mph—numbers that still raise eyebrows for a four-cylinder from 30 years ago.

Unlike modern performance cars, the Esprit doesn’t throw lap times at you or insulate you from the road. It demands your attention—rewarding finesse over force, momentum over brute power. And because Lotus didn’t overproduce these (only about 625 S4s made it to the U.S. between 1993–1995), they remain genuinely rare on the roads and at cars and coffee events.

Thoughtful upgrades for longevity and performance include: aluminum radiators and tanks, a rebuilt turbo, upgraded manifold, upgraded exhaust, improved cooling systems, and even a race-spec suspension with poly bushings and AP Racing brakes. Some upgrades included gaudy aftermarket flares or unnecessary power mods—they’re reliability and drivability improvements that address well-known Lotus quirks while respecting the car’s original character.

There’s no denying that Esprits require care. Deferred maintenance can tank their reputation. But for someone who understands what they are—beautiful, imperfect, deeply involving—cars like this one are increasingly hard to find. And with fewer clean, sorted S4s remaining, values are finally ticking upward, especially as enthusiasts start to re-evaluate 1990s analog cars in a sea of digital performance.

Here’s a deeper look at this one, including gallery and spec sheet:

For anyone who's owned or driven an S4 or SE: what’s been your experience? Do you think this generation of Esprit will ever get the collector recognition it deserves—or will it always be the underdog next to Ferraris and 911s?",1,1753117965.0,GatewayCCNewArrivals,0,1.0,False

She wasn’t physically abusive, but mentally? She destroyed me in ways I’m still untangling in therapy today. She made me feel like loving her was a burden I owed her and even then, it was never enough.

[[Explore Top Rated 17 inch laptop sleeve on Amazon.]](https://site.rediys.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=17 inch laptop sleeve)

## Key Features Analysis

The best 17-inch laptop sleeves differentiate themselves through a combination of durable materials, thoughtful design, and practical features. The following are key aspects to consider when evaluating different options.

**External Material:** The external material is the first line of defense against the elements and everyday wear and tear.High-quality sleeves utilize water-resistant or waterproof fabrics like ballistic nylon, durable polyester, or even premium leather. A robust material will ensure your laptop stays dry and protected from scratches and minor impacts.

Quality sleeves boast exteriors made of tightly woven ballistic nylon which is known for its abrasion resistance and ability to withstand harsh conditions.Other sleeves opt for durable polyester with a water-resistant coating, providing reliable protection against spills and light rain. Premium options may feature genuine leather, offering a refined look and a degree of water resistance when properly treated.

**Internal Padding:** Adequate internal padding is essential for cushioning the laptop against shocks and vibrations. Look for sleeves with thick foam padding or shock-absorbing materials like memory foam or specialized impact-resistant polymers. The padding should cover all sides of the laptop,including the corners,for maximum protection.

High-end laptop sleeves incorporate memory foam padding that conforms to the shape of the laptop, providing custom-fit protection. Some sleeves employ egg-crate foam for enhanced shock absorption, while others use strategically placed impact-resistant polymers to safeguard vulnerable areas. Corner padding is also essential in protecting the corners of the laptop.

**Closure Mechanism:** The closure mechanism should securely hold the laptop in place while allowing for easy access. Zippers are the most common option, but look for high-quality zippers that are durable and smooth to operate. Magnetic closures and velcro flaps are also available, offering different levels of security and convenience.

Look for zippers made from durable materials like YKK, known for their reliability and smooth operation.Magnetic closures provide a sleek and secure option, while velcro flaps offer a simple and adjustable option. The closure mechanism should be designed to prevent accidental openings and ensure the laptop stays securely inside.

**Additional Storage:** Many laptop sleeves include additional storage compartments for accessories such as chargers, cables, mice, and pens. these compartments can be zippered pockets, elastic loops, or padded pouches. The size and configuration of the storage space should be considered based on your specific needs and the amount of accessories you typically carry.

Some sleeves feature multiple zippered pockets of varying sizes to accommodate different accessories. Elastic loops are useful for organizing cables and pens, while padded pouches provide extra protection for fragile items like mice. The location and accessibility of these compartments should also be considered for maximum convenience.

**Size and Fit:** The size and fit of the sleeve is crucial for ensuring your laptop is securely protected.Measure your laptop's dimensions (length, width, and thickness) and compare them to the sleeve's internal dimensions.The sleeve should fit snugly without being too tight, allowing for easy insertion and removal of the laptop.

A sleeve that is too small will be arduous to close and may put pressure on the laptop, while a sleeve that is too large will not provide adequate protection and may allow the laptop to shift around during transport. look for sleeves that are specifically designed for 17-inch laptops and that provide precise internal dimensions.

**Carrying Options:** Some laptop sleeves include carrying handles or detachable shoulder straps for added convenience. These features make it easier to transport the laptop without having to carry it in your hands or inside a larger bag.

These compartments help you keep your accessories organized and within easy reach, preventing clutter and simplifying your workflow. This is notably useful for professionals who need to have their essential accessories readily available.

consider a busy workday at a coffee shop. Without a sleeve with storage compartments,your accessories might be scattered around your workspace,creating a disorganized and chaotic surroundings.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions about 17-inch laptop sleeves will help provide clarity and confidence in their purchasing decision.

**Are all 17-inch laptop sleeves truly the same size?**
no, not all 17-inch laptop sleeves are created equal in size. While they are generally designed to fit laptops with 17-inch screens, the actual internal dimensions can vary slightly between manufacturers and models. It's essential to check the specific internal dimensions of the sleeve against your laptop's external dimensions to ensure a proper fit. A sleeve that is too small may strain the laptop, while one that is too large may not provide adequate protection.

**How do I properly clean my laptop sleeve?**
The cleaning method depends on the material of your laptop sleeve. For fabric sleeves (like nylon or polyester),you can usually spot clean with a damp cloth and mild soap.Avoid using harsh chemicals or bleach, as these can damage the material. Leather sleeves require special leather cleaners and conditioners to maintain their appearance and prevent cracking. Always check the manufacturer's instructions for specific cleaning recommendations.

**What is the difference between water-resistant and waterproof?**
Water-resistant materials can repel water to some extent, providing protection against light rain or spills. However, they are not completely impervious to water and may allow moisture to penetrate over time or with prolonged exposure. Waterproof materials, conversely, are completely impermeable to water, providing maximum protection against heavy rain or submersion. When choosing a laptop sleeve, consider the level of water protection you need based on your typical usage and environment.

1m5ooap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1m5ooap/deep_by_kylie_scott_read_online_free/,Deep by Kylie Scott Read online free:," I was pregnant.  
  
  ""Fuck.""  
  
  The word echoed around and around the small bathroom, bouncing off the white-tiled walls and beating at my head. This shit shouldn't be happening to me. I didn't break laws or do drugs. Not since that blip after Dad left. I was studying hard for my degree in psychology and I behaved. Mostly. But those definite neat pink lines stood loud and proud in the pregnancy test's little window, taunting me, the evidence irrefutable even when I squinted or crossed my eyes.  
  
  ""Fuck.""  
  
  Me as someone's mom. No.  
  
  What the hell was I going to do?  
  
  I sat on the edge of the bathtub in my plain black underwear, covered in goose bumps. Outside, a barren limb swayed in and out of view, buffeted by the wind. Beyond it lay the endless gray of a February Portland sky. Screw it all. All of my plans and dreams, my whole life, changed at the say of a stupid plastic stick. I was only twenty-one, for goodness sake, not even in a relationship.  
  
  Ben.  
  
  Ah, man. We'd barely talked in months, what with me doing my best to avoid any situation where he might be present. Things had been a little awkward ever since I threw him out of my hotel room in Vegas minus his pants. I'd been done with him. Finished. Kaput.  
  
  My uterus apparently did not agree.  
  
  We'd had sex once. Once. A secret that I'd long since decided to take to my grave. Him never telling anyone was a given. But still, his penis went in my vagina one time only, and I'd watched him roll the condom on, god damn it. Me lying spread out on the California king-size, trembling with excitement, and he'd just kind of smiled. There'd been this warmth in his eyes, a gentleness. Given the obvious tension running through his big body, it'd seemed so strange and yet wondrous. No one had ever looked at me that way, as if I meant everything.  
  
  An unwelcome warmth filled my chest at the memory. It'd been so long since I'd thought of him with anything other than ugh.  
  
  At any rate, apparently someone had diddled away their shift at the prophylactics factory and here we were. Pregnant. I stared unseeing at my skinny jeans, lying discarded on the floor. Sure, they'd fit. As in, I could wiggle up the zip halfway and the button was out of the question. The pressure they inflicted upon my belly was a definite no go.  
  
  Things were changing so fast. I was changing.  
  
  Normally, I had more going on in the back than up front. But for the first time in my life, I actually had the makings of a rack. Not enough boobage to get me a job at Hooters or anything, but still. And as much as I'd like to believe that god had finally answered my teenage prayers, when you added up all the evidence, it wasn't likely. I had a person growing inside of me. A little baby bean-shaped thing made from equal parts of me and him.  
  
  Mind-boggling.  
  
  What I'd wear tonight was, however, the least of my worries. If only I could get out of going. He'd be there, all six foot five-worth of rugged rock star. Just the thought of seeing him turned me inside out, filling me with nerves. My stomach dived, nausea rolling through me. Puke rushed up, filling my throat and making me gag. I only just made it to the toilet in time to lose what little I'd had for lunch. Two Oreos and half a banana, going, going ... gone in a hot rush.  
  
  Yuck.  
  
  I groaned loudly and wiped my mouth with the back of my hand, flushed the toilet and staggered over to the sink. Whoa. The girl in the mirror looked spectacularly crappy, face too pale and long blond hair hanging in straggly wet strands. What a hot mess. I couldn't even bring myself to meet my own eyes.  
  
  That I'd dropped the pregnancy test didn't even occur to me until I stood on it. My heel pressed down, grinding of its own accord. Plastic cracked and splintered, the noise strangely satisfying. I just stamped on it, over and over, trampling the bastard, pounding it into the scuffed wooden floor. God yeah, the good vibes just flowed. The first test soon met the same fate. I didn't stop until I was panting and only wreckage remained on the floor. That felt so much better.  
  
  So I'd been knocked up by a rock star.  
  
  Big deal.  
  
  Deep breath. Okay.  
  
  I would handle this like an adult, pull myself together and go talk to Ben. We'd been friends at one time. Sort of. I could still talk to him about stuff. Specifically, stuff relating to our progeny arriving in, oh ... seven or so months.  
  
  Yes, I could, and I would.  
  
  Just as soon as I'd finished throwing my tantrum.  
  
  \*  
  
  ""You're late. Get in here,"" said my sister, Anne, grabbing my hand and dragging me through the doorway. Not that I'd been lurking outside, skulking and hesitating. Much.  
  
  ""Sorry.""  
  
  ""I thought you were going to bail on me. Again."" She gave me a quick, affectionate squeeze, then stole my coat off my shoulders. It got thrown onto a nearby chair already overflowing with other jackets. ""Everyone else is already here.""  
  
  ""Great,"" I mumbled.  
  
  True enough, there was a goodly amount of noise happening within the multimillion-dollar Pearl District loft. Anne and I didn't come from money. Quite the contrary. If it hadn't been for her encouraging me to go for scholarships and supporting me financially by paying for books, etcetera, I'd never have made it to college. Last year, however, my normally sensible and subdued sister had somehow found herself shacked up with rock 'n' roll royalty.  
  
  I know, right? How it all happened still confused me, somewhat. Between the two of us, I'd always played the role of the bubbly one. Whenever Anne got down, I'd pick her back up again, fill the  
spaces in the conversations and keep right on smiling through the rain. Yet here she was, high on life and crazy in love, truly happy for the first time in just about forever. It was wonderful.  
  
  Details regarding their whirlwind romance ranged from vague to none. But just before Christmas, she and Malcolm Ericson, the drummer for Stage Dive (about the biggest rock band ever), had tied the knot. I was now counted as part of the band's extended entourage. To be fair, they'd embraced me wholeheartedly from the start. They were good people. It was just the thought of seeing him reducing me to a jittering, nervous wreck with super enhanced puking abilities.  
  
  ""You'll never guess what happened."" Anne linked her arm with mine, towing me toward the crowded dinner table.  
  
  Toward my doom.  
  
  A crowd of about seven sat around it with drinks in hand, laughing and chatting. I think it was The National playing quietly on the sound system. Candles flickered and small twinkling party lights hung overhead. My mouth watered despite my queasy stomach, what with all the delicious foodie scents filling the air. Wow, Anne and Mal had really gone all out for the occasion of their two-month wedding anniversary. Suddenly, my black tights and pale blue tunic (a loose-knit fabric which in no way hugged or hindered the waistline) seemed insufficient. Though it was hard to go for glamour with a plastic bag in your pocket just in case you needed to hurl.  
  
  ""What happened?"" I asked, dragging my feet ever so slightly.  
  
  She leaned in and whisper-hissed theatrically, ""Ben brought a date.""  
  
  Everything stopped. And I do mean everything. My lungs, my feet ... everything.  
  
  A flicker of a frown crossed Anne's face. ""Liz?""  
  
  I blinked, slowly coming back to life. ""Yeah?""  
  
  ""You okay?""  
  
  ""Sure. So, um, Ben brought a date?""  
  
  ""Can you believe it?""  
  
  ""No."" I really couldn't. My brain had stalled, same as everything else. There'd been no date in my plans for speaking with Ben tonight.  
  
  ""I know. First time for everything I guess. Everyone's slightly weirded out, though she seems nice enough.""  
  
  ""But Ben doesn't date,"" I said, my voice sounding hollow somehow, as if it were an echo coming from far away. ""He doesn't even believe in relationships.""  
  
  Anne cocked her head, smiling ever so slightly. ""Lizzy, you don't still have a crush on him, do you?""  
  
  ""No."" I barked out a laugh. As if. He'd disabused me of such idiotic notions, in Vegas. ""So much no my cup is overflowing and the no is spilling onto the floor.""  
  
  ""Good."" She sighed happily.  
  
  ""Lizzy!"" A booming loud voice rang out.  
  
  ""Hey, Mal.""  
  
  ""Say hello to your Aunt Elizabeth, son."" My new brother-in-law thrust a black-and-white puppy straight at me. A wet little tongue swiped my lips, and warm panting puppy breath, ripe with the scent of dog biscuits, filled my face. Not good.  
  
  ""Whoa."" I leaned way the hell back, trying to breathe through the urge to yet again heave. Pregnancy was the best. ""Hi, Killer.""  
  
  ""Give him to me,"" said Anne. ""Not everybody wants to French kiss the dog, Mal.""  
  
  The blond, heavily tattooed man grinned, handing the fur baby over. ""But he's a great kisser. I taught him myself.""  
  
  ""Unfortunately, that's true."" Anne tucked the pup under an arm, giving him a scratch on the head. ""How are you? You said you'd been feeling sick, the other day on the phone.""  
  
  ""All better,"" I lied. Or partly lied. After all, I definitely wasn't sick.  
  
  ""Did you go to the doctor?""  
  
  ""No need.""  
  
  ""Why don't I make an appointment tomorrow, just in case?""  
  
  ""Not necessary.""  
  
  ""But--""  
  
  ""Anne, relax. I'm telling you I'm not sick."" I gave her my brightest smile. ""I promise, I'm fine.""  
  
  ""All right."" She placed the pup on the ground and pulled out a chair in the middle of the table. ""I saved you a place next to me.""  
  
  ""Thanks.""  
  
  And so it was (with me trying not to barf while wiping dog spit off my face) that I saw him again. Ben, sitting opposite, staring straight at me. Those dark eyes ... I immediately looked down. He didn't affect me. He didn't. I just wasn't ready to face up to this. Wherein this equaled him and me and that room and Vegas and the consequences that were currently growing in my belly.  
  
  I couldn't do it, not yet.  
  
  ""Hey, Liz,"" he said, deep voice calm, casual.  
  
  ""Hey.""  
  
  Yeah. I was so over him. The date thing had thrown me, but now I was back on track. I just had to compartmentalize any unhelpful lingering feelings, file them away for never.  
  
  I took a step closer, daring a peek only to find him watching me warily. He threw back some beer then set the bottle down, swiping his thumb across his mouth to catch a stray drop. In Vegas, he'd first tasted of beer, lust, and need. The most dizzying mix. He had beautiful lips, perfectly framed by his short beard. His hair had grown out of the shaved on the sides and longish on top cool hipster cut, and honestly, he looked kind of shaggy, wild.  
  
  And big, though he always looked big.  
  
  A silver ring pierced one side of his nose and he had on a green plaid shirt, top button open to showcase his thick neck and the edge of a black rose tattoo. Any money blue jeans and black boots were below. Apart from Vegas at the wedding, and then later that night in my room, I'd never seen him out of jeans. Let me assure you, there's nothing bad about the man naked. Everything was as it should be and then some. In fact, he'd looked a lot like a dream come true.  
  
  My dream.  
  
  I swallowed hard, ignoring my perky nipples while firmly pushing the memory back down where it belonged. Buried among the Hannah Montana song lyrics, Vampire Diary character histories, and other useless and potentially damaging information collected over the years. None of it mattered anymore.  
  
  The room had gone quiet. How awkward.  
  
  Ben tugged at the collar of his shirt, shifting in his seat.  
  
  Why the hell was he staring at me? Maybe because I was still staring at him. Shit. My knees gave out and I collapsed into the chair with an ever so dainty thud. I kept my eyes cast down because down was safe. So long as I didn't look at him or this date of his, I'd be fine and dandy. Dinner couldn't last for more than three, four hours max. No worries.  
  
  I half raised a hand in greeting. ""Hi, everyone.""  
  
  Hey's and hi's and variations of both floated back.  
  
  ""How have you been, Liz?"" asked Ev, from further down the table. She was seated beside her husband, David Ferris, Stage Dive's lead guitarist and songwriter.  
  
  ""Great."" Crap. ""You?""  
  
  ""Good.""  
  
  I sucked in a deep breath and smiled. ""Excellent.""  
  
  ""You been busy with school?"" She pulled out a hair tie and bundled her blond hair up into a rough ponytail. God bless the girl. At least it wasn't just me keeping it casual. ""We haven't seen you since Christmas.""  
  
  ""Yeah, busy."" Puking and sleeping mostly. Gestating. ""School and stuff, you know.""  
  
  Normally I'd have an interesting story to tell from my psych studies. Today, nada.  
  
  ""Right."" Her husband slipped an arm around her shoulders and she turned to smile at him, eyes all lovelorn and our conversation forgotten.  
  
  Which worked for me.  
  
  I rubbed the toe of my boot back and forth against the floor, looking left and right and anywhere but straight ahead. I toyed with the hem of my tunic, winding a loose thread tight around my finger until it turned purple. Then I loosened it. It probably wasn't good for the bean, somehow. As of tomorrow, I needed to start studying up on this baby stuff. Get the facts, because getting rid of the bean ... it just wasn't for me.  
  
  The date tittered at something he said and I felt a stab of pain inside. Probably gas.  
  
  ""Here."" Anne filled the glass in front of me with white wine.  
  
  ""Oh. Thanks.""  
  
  ""Try it,"" she said with a smile. ""It's sweet and kind of crisp. I think you'll like it.""  
  
  My stomach tipped upside down just at the thought. ""Later maybe. I drank some water right before I arrived. So ... yeah, I'm not rea  
lly thirsty just yet.""  
  
  ""All right."" Her eyes narrowed as she gave me a that-was-weird smile. All too soon it morphed into a flat, unhappy line. ""You look a little pale. Are you okay?""  
  
  ""Absolutely!"" I nodded, smiled, and turned to the woman on my other side before Anne could grill me further on the subject. ""Hi, Lena.""  
  
  ""Lizzy. How you been?"" The curvy brunette held hands with her partner, Jimmy Ferris, the lead singer of Stage Dive. He sat at the head of the table, resplendent in an undoubtedly handmade suit. When he saw me he gave me one of the chin tips the guys seemed to specialize in. It said it all. Or at least it said it all when all they wanted to say was Hey.  
  
  I nodded back at him. And all the while I could feel Anne hovering at my side, bottle of wine still in hand and big-sisterly concern growing by the moment, pawing at the ground and getting ready to pounce. I was so screwed. Anne had pretty much raised me from the age of fourteen, when our dad left and our mom checked out on us--one day just went to bed and didn't get up again. Now and then Anne's need to nurture still got a little out of control. What she'd have to say about the bean didn't bear thinking about. It wouldn't be pretty.  
  
  But one problem at a time.  
  
  ""All good, Lena,"" I said. ""You?""  
  
  Lena opened her mouth. Whatever she'd been about to say, however, was lost beneath the sudden thrashing of drums and insanely loud wailing of guitars. It basically sounded like hell was spilling forth all around us. Armageddon had come a-knocking.  
  
  ""Babe,"" Anne hollered at her husband. ""No death metal during dinner! We talked about this.""  
  
  Said ""babe,"" Malcolm Ericson, paused his head banging at the top of the table. ""But, Pumpkin--""  
  
  ""Please.""  
  
  The drummer rolled his eyes and, with the flick of a finger, silenced the storm raging through the sound system.  
  
  My ears rang on in the quiet.  
  
  ""Christ,"" muttered Jimmy. ""Time and a place for shit like that. Try never when I'm around, yeah?""  
  
  Mal looked down the length of his nose at the dapper man. ""Don't be so judgy, Jim. I think Hemorrhaging Otter would make a wonderful warm-up act.""  
  
  ""Are you fucking serious? That's their name?"" asked David.  
  
  ""Delightfully inventive, no?""  
  
  ""One way to put it,"" said David, nose wrinkled in distaste. ""And Ben already picked a warm-up act.""  
  
  ""I didn't even get a vote,"" grumped Mal.  
  
  ""Dude."" Ben shoved an irritated hand through his hair. ""You'll all want to hang with your women. I'll need some people around after the show I can chill and have a beer with, so I went ahead and chose. Suck it up.Bitter grumbling from Mal.  
  
  Ev just shook her head. ""Wow. Hemorrhaging Otter. That's certainly unique.""  
  
  ""What do you think, babe?"" Jimmy turned to Lena.  
  
  ""That's disgusting. I think I'm going to throw up."" The woman swallowed hard, her face going gray. ""I mean, I think I really am.""  
  
  Huh. And also, ugh, I knew that feeling.  
  
  ""Shit."" Jimmy started rubbing her back with frantic motions.  
  
  Without a word, I pressed my spare plastic puke bag into her hand. Solidarity among sisters, etcetera.  
  
  ""Thanks,"" she said, happily too preoccupied to ask why I'd had it in my pocket in the first place.  
  
  ""She had some stomach bug before Christmas."" With his spare hand, Jimmy filled Lena's glass with water and passed it to her. ""Keeps messing with her.""  
  
  I froze.  
  
  ""I thought it had gone,"" said Lena.  
  
  ""You're going to have to go to the doctor. Enough excuses, we're not that busy."" Jimmy planted a soft kiss on the side of her face. ""Tomorrow, yeah?""  
  
  ""Okay.""  
  
  ""Sounds wise,"" said Anne, patting my rigid shoulder.  
  
  Holy hell.  
  
  ""You've been sick too, Lizzy?"" asked Lena.  
  
  ""You should both try some green tea with ginger in it,"" a voice reported from the other side of the table.  
  
  Female.  
  
  Damn, it was her. His date.  
  
  ""Ginger creates warmth and helps to settle an upset stomach. What other symptoms did you have?"" she asked, causing me to immediately sink down in my seat.  
  
  Ben cleared his throat. ""Sasha's a naturopath.""  
  
  ""I thought you said she was a dancer,"" said Anne, her face screwing up ever so slightly.  
  
  ""A burlesque performer,"" the woman corrected. ""I do both.""  
  
  Yeah, I had nothing.  
  
  A chair scraped against the floor, and then Sasha was standing, peering down at me. Any hopes of avoiding and/or ignoring her presence fled the scene. Bettie Page hair done a vibrant blue, very cool. Christ, did she have to look like she actually had a clue? A bimbo I could handle, but not this. The woman was beautiful and smart, and I was just a dumb kid who'd gone and gotten herself knocked up. Cue the violins.  
  
  I smiled grimly. ""Hi.""  
  
  ""Any other symptoms?"" she repeated, gaze moving between me and Lena.  
  
  ""She's been tired a lot too,"" said Jimmy. ""Passes out in front of the TV all the time.""  
  
  ""True."" Lena frowned.  
  
  ""Lizzy, you said you'd missed some school, didn't you?"" asked Anne.  
  
  ""Some,"" I admitted, not liking the direction this grilling was taking. Time for a smooth segue. ""Anyway, how are the plans for the tour going? You guys must all be so excited. I'd be excited. Have you started packing yet, Anne?""  
  
  My sister just blinked at me.  
  
  ""No?"" Maybe a sudden outburst of verbal diarrhea wasn't the answer.  
  
  ""Hold up. Have you been sick, Liz?"" Ben asked, his deep voice softening ever so slightly. Though maybe that was just my imagination.  
  
  ""Um...""  
  
  ""Maybe you got the same bug Lena's got,"" he said. ""How much school have you missed?""  
  
  My throat closed tight. I couldn't do it. Not here and now in front of everyone. I should have fled for the Yukon rather than come here tonight. No way was I ready for this.  
  
  ""Liz?""  
  
  ""No, I'm fine,"" I wheezed. ""All good.""  
  
  ""Um, hello,"" said Anne. ""You said you'd been nauseous for the last few weeks. If I hadn't been away I'd have dragged you to the doctor's way back.""  
  
  And thank god she'd been on her second honeymoon with Mal in Hawaii. To have found out about the bean with Anne in attendance would have been up there with watching the four horseman of the apocalypse riding into town. Terror, tears, chaos--all of these things and more. Definitely not my idea of a good time.  
  
  The date, Sasha, fixed her inquiring gaze to the ever so subtly still gagging Lena.  
  
  ""Did anyone else get this?"" she asked.  
  
  ""I don't think so."" Anne looked up and down the table, taking in the various shaking of heads. ""Just Lena and Lizzy.""  
  
  ""We've been fine,"" said Ev.  
  
  ""Weird,"" said Anne. ""Liz and Lena haven't been around each other since the wedding. That's over two months ago now.""  
  
  Murmurs of agreement.  
  
  My heartbeat raced. Mine and the bean's both.  
  
  ""Well, I think they should both take a pregnancy test,"" announced Sasha, retaking her seat.  
  
  A moment's stunned silence.  
  
  ""What?"" I spluttered, panic coursing through me. Not here, not now, and sure as fuck not this way. Bile burned my throat, but I swallowed it back down, fumbling for the second puke bag.  
  
  Ben's brow wrinkled and there were startled coughs and gasps from others.  
  
  But before anyone could comment, a strange screechy noise came from Lena.  
  
  ""No,"" she cried, voice very high and very determined. ""No, I am not. You take that back.""  
  
  The back-rubbing by Jimmy went berserk. ""Baby, calm down.""  
  
  She didn't. Instead, she pointed a shaking finger at the now very unwelcome stranger in our midst. ""You have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. I don't know, maybe you've taken a hit to the head from one of those big fancy dancing fans lately or something. Whatever. But you ... you couldn't be more wrong.""  
  
  ""Okay, let's calm down a little."" Ben raised his hands in protest.  
  
  Sasha kept quiet.  
  
  ""Lizzy?"" My sister's fingers dug into my shoulder, bruisingly tight. ""There's no chance, right? I mean, you know better than that. You wouldn't be so stupid.""  
  
  My mouth opened, but nothing came out.  
  
  Suddenly, Lena clutched at her belly. ""Jimmy, in your car outside my sister's wedding. We didn't use anything.""  
  
  ""I know,"" he said quietly, perfect face white as snow. ""Time we fucked against the door, night before you left. We forgot then too.""  
  
  ""Yeah.""  
  
  ""Your tits have been really sensitive."" With one hand, Jimmy scrubbed at his mouth. ""And you were complaining your dress wouldn't do up the other day.""  
  
  ""I thought it was just pie.""  
  
  They both stared at one another while everyone looked on. I was pretty damn certain they'd long since forgotten they had an audience for all these intimate details. As dinner entertainment went, this had turned into one hell of a drama, and oh god, the horror of it. My head started to turn in dizzy circles.  
  
  ""Lizzy?"" Anne asked again.  
  
  Okay, this wasn't good. I really and truly shouldn't have come. But how the hell was I to know Ben would bring along a gynecological psychic? The edges of my vision blurred, my lungs working overtime. I couldn't get enough air. Not to sound paranoid, but I bet that Sasha bitch had stolen it all. Never mind. The important thing was not to panic.  
  
  Maybe I should jump out a window.  
  
  ""Liz,"" a voice said. A different one this time, deep and strong.  
  
  However I'd imagined me and Ben having this talk, it was nothing like this. Not tonight, before I'd even processed it myself. Time to go.  
  
  ""Lizzy?""  
  
  Also, wow, if this was the result of having great sex then I was so never going there again. Not even for mediocre sex. Nothing. I might even rule out masturbation, just in case. You couldn't be too careful. Random attack sperm could be anywhere, just waiting to get a girl into trouble.  
  
  I stumbled to my feet, sweaty hands on the table to steady myself. ""I should go.""  
  
  ""Hey."" A big hand cupped my chin. Lines had appeared between Ben's brows, beside his mouth. But you could only see the hint of them behind his beard, the implication. The man was not happy, and fair enough. ""It's okay, Liz. We'll get this sorted--""  
  
  ""I'm pregnant.""  
  
  A pause. ""What?""  
  
  ""I'm pregnant, Ben.""  
  
  The ensuing silence echoed in my ears, an endless gray noise like something out of a horror movie.  
  
  Ben stood bent over the table, breathing heavy. I guess I'd looked to him for strength, but now he seemed every bit as strung out as me.  
  
  ""You're pregnant?"" Anne's voice cut the silence. ""L  
izzy, look at me.""  
  
  I did, though it wasn't easy. My chin didn't seem inclined to go in the desired direction, and who could blame it?  
  
  ""Yes,"" I said. ""I am.""  
  
  She went horribly still.  
  
  ""I'm sorry.""  
  
  ""How could you? Oh god."" For a moment she squeezed her eyes shut, then opened them again. ""And why were you telling him?""  
  
  ""Good question."" Ever so slowly, Mal rose from his seat and started walking down the other side of the table. ""Why'd she tell you, Benny?""  
  
  ""Liz and I need to talk."" Ben's gaze skipped to Mal, his hand falling from my face. ""Man.""  
  
  ""You didn't,"" said Mal, his voice low and lethal as the tension in the room took an entirely new turn for the worse.  
  
  ""Calm down.""  
  
  ""Told you stay away from her. Didn't I? She's my girl's kid sister for Christ's sake.""  
  
  Ben stood tall. ""I can explain.""  
  
  ""Shit,"" muttered David.  
  
  ""No. No, you can't, Benny. I fucking asked you to leave her alone, bro. You promised me she'd be off-limits.""  
  
  Past Ben, David Ferris got to his feet, as did Jimmy at the end of the table. It was all happening so fast.  
  
  Ben's date, Sasha, the burlesque dancer with the blue hair, seemed to finally understand the shit storm she'd unleashed with her most excellent announcement. Perhaps she wasn't so psychic after all. ""We should leave. Ben?""  
  
  He didn't even look at her, his gaze glued to Mal.  
  
  ""You're like a brother to me, Benny. One of my closest friends. But she's my little sister now. Tell me you didn't go there.""  
  
  ""Mal, man--""  
  
  ""Not after you gave me your word. You wouldn't do that, not to me.""  
  
  ""Dude, calm down,"" said David, moving up to try and get between the two. ""Let's talk about this.""  
  
  Ben was almost a head taller than Mal, definitely bigger, stronger. It didn't matter. With a battle cry, Mal launched himself at the man. They fell together onto the floor, rolling and wrestling, fists flying. It was a mess. I jumped to my feet, mouth hanging open. Someone screamed, a woman. The rich copper scent of blood hit the air and the urge to hurl was almost overwhelming, but there wasn't time for that.  
  
  ""No!"" I yelled. ""Don't, please.""  
  
  I'd done this, so it was up to me to fix it. I got a knee up on the table before hands grasped my arms, holding me back no matter how I fought.  
  
  ""Mal, no!""  
  
  David and Jimmy tore Mal off of Ben, dragging the struggling man back across the room.  
  
  ""I'm going to fucking kill you,"" Mal hollered, his face a mixture of reds from fury and blood. ""Let me go!""  
  
  More blood dripped from beneath Ben's nose, trailing down his chin. But he made no move to stop it. Slowly, the big man got to his feet, and the look on his face tore me in two.  
  
  ""You said you wouldn't chase after her.""  
  
  ""He didn't,"" I shouted, still standing on one foot with a knee on the table and Anne's hand on my arm. ""He didn't want anything to do with me. I chased after him. It was all me. I'm sorry.""  
  
  Silence fell and I was surrounded by stunned faces. And a couple of still-bleeding ones.  
  
  ""I practically stalked him. He never stood a chance.""  
  
  ""What?"" Mal scowled, one eyelid swelling at an alarming rate.  
  
  ""It's my fault, not Ben's. I'm the one who did it.""  
  
  ""Liz."" With a heavy sigh, Ben hung his head.  
  
  The fingers on my arm gave a small tug. I turned to face my sister.  
  
  ""Explain this to me.""  
  
  CHAPTER ONE  
  
  FOUR MONTHS AGO  
  
  Good girls don't fall for rock stars. It just isn't done.  
  
  ""Pumpkin! PUUUMP-KIN!""  
  
  ""Oh god."" My sister, the aforementioned Pumpkin, giggled.  
  
  I just gaped. It seemed to be my go-to look of the day.  
  
  Lord knows, I'd been wearing it ever since letting myself into Anne's apartment this morning. Because I lived on campus, we'd starting doing brunch every Sunday morning since moving to Portland a few years back. It was our sisterly thing. But instead of standing ready to serve the bacon and eggs this morning, I'd found, Anne was fast asleep on top of a tattooed stud on the sofa. Both of them mostly clothed, thank god.  
  
  But, wow, what a revelation. I mean, I didn't even know Anne dated. I'd thought me dragging her along to the occasional party on campus was the sum total of her social life.  
  
  ""C'mon, woman,"" said Mal, her brand-spanking-new boyfriend. ""We can't be late to practice or Davie'll get his panties in a wad. You have no idea what drama queens guitarists can be. I swear, last week he threw a total hissy fit just 'cause he broke a string. Started screaming and throwing shit at people. True story.""  
  
  ""That is not a true story,"" admonished Anne, shaking her head. ""David is a perfectly nice guy. Stop trying to scare Lizzy.""  
  
  ""No-o-o."" Mal gave her big innocent puppy eyes, even going so far as to bat his eyelashes. ""You think I would lie to Lizzy, my sweet little future sister-in-law?""  
  
  Anne just shook her head. ""Are we going in or what?""  
  
  ""Can't believe you doubted me, Pumpkin.""  
  
  We followed the manic blond drummer into a big old building down by the river. As good a place for a loud rock band to practice as any. The only neighbors were industrial buildings, abandoned for the weekend. Inside wasn't any warmer, but at least we were out of the bone-chilling October wind. I stuffed my hands into the pockets of my gray woolen coat, nervous now that we were actually about to meet them. My sole interactions with the rich and famous started this morning with Mal. If the rest of the band was anything like him, I'd never keep up.  
  
  ""As if anyone could doubt me. That hurt bad,"" he said. ""Apologize.""  
  
  ""Sorry.""  
  
  Mal smacked a noisy kiss on her cheek. ""You're forgiven. Later.""  
  
  Stretching his fingers and rotating his wrists, the man bounded off toward the stage assembled at one end. Instruments, amps, and other sound gear covered it and the surrounding area, with roadies and sound techs busy amid it all.  
  
  It was fascinating, this, him, and my whole damn morning. Mal and Anne seemed so in tune with each other. Perhaps Anne and I had been a touch too hasty in our dismissal of romantic love and affection. So it hadn't worked out for our parents. Hell, those two had pretty much made a mockery of commitment and marriage. Mal and Anne might yet make a far better case study.  
  
  Fascinating.  
  
  ""He's borderline insane by the way,"" I said quietly. ""So manic.""  
  
  ""Yeah. Isn't he great?"" She grinned.  
  
  I nodded, because anyone who could make her smile so bright clearly must be. The light of hope in her eyes, the happiness, it was beautiful.  
  
  And the man in question? None other than Malcolm Ericson, drummer for worldwide renowned rock group Stage Dive, had somehow shacked up with my sister. My quiet, calm, color-within-the-lines-or-else sister. Anne was being vague about the details, but the facts remained the same. Her new boyfriend stunned me stupid. Perhaps someone had slipped something into my coffee back on campus. It would certainly explain all of the crazy.  
  
  ""Can't believe you told him about me crushing on him when I was a kid."" Ever so gently, Anne elbowed me in the side.  
  
  I grunted in pain.  
  
  ""Thanks for that,"" she said.  
  
  ""You're welcome. What else are sisters for?""  
  
  We wandered toward the couple of women sitting on storage boxes at the back of the hall. So cool, getting to see the band practice. Anne had truly been the psycho fan, plastering her bedroom wall with posters of Stage Dive. Mostly of Mal, making today's dating revelation all the more holy hell. But if anyone deserved some amazing, mind-blowing good to come their way, it was my sister. I couldn't begin to tell you how much she'd given up to get us this far.  
  
  The blond woman smiled in greeting as we got closer, but the curvy brunette just kept playing with her cell.  
  
  ""Hello, fellow Stage Dive groupies and hanger-onners. How is your Sunday morning?"" the blonde asked.  
  
  ""Good,"" said Anne. ""How are you feeling, Mrs. Ferris?""  
  
  ""I am feeling very, very married, tha  
nk you for asking. How are you and Mal doing?""  
  
  ""Ah, good. All good."" Anne joined them, sitting on one of the boxes. ""This is my sister, Lizzy. She goes to school at PSU. Lizzy this is Ev, David's wife, and Lena, Jimmy's...""  
  
  ""Assistant. Hi."" Lena gave me a small smile and chin tip.  
  
  ""Hi."" I waved.  
  
  ""Nice to meet you,"" said Ev. ""Anne, quickly before they start playing. Tell me the story of you and Malcolm. I still haven't heard how you got together, exactly. But Lauren mentioned he basically invaded your apartment.""  
  
  Back at her apartment, I'd overheard an odd argument between her and Mal. Something about them having an ""agreement."" When I questioned her she'd basically told me to butt out, in her own sweet way. I could only take her word that all was well, and try not to worry. Still, the question and Anne's reaction to it interested me greatly. I ever so subtly shuffled a little closer.  
  
  The whites of Anne's eyes flashed. ""Ah, well, we met at your place the other night and hit it off.""  
  
  ""That's it?"" asked Ev.  
  
  ""Yes, that's pretty much it."" Anne's smile wavered only slightly. ""What is this, Ev, a grilling?""  
  
  ""Yes, this is a grilling. Give me more information, please?""  
  
  ""He's really great and yes, he kind of moved himself in with me. But I love having him there. He's wonderful, you know?""  
  
  So they weren't going to get any more out of her than I had. No big surprise. Anne tended to be tight lipped, a private person.  
  
  The girls kept on talking.  
  
  Up on the stage only the band members now remained, the rest moving off to the side to play with various bits of equipment. They stood gathered around Mal and his drum kit, deep in conversation. So this must be the band. Jeans and T-shirts seemed to be the go-to, scruffy cool hairdos and lots of tats. One of them stood a good half a head taller than the rest, and the rest were not tiny. This guy must be a giant. And it'll sound crazy, but there was just something about the way he stood, the solidity of him. Mountains had never seemed so strong and imposing. Big boots several feet apart and a hand wrapped high around the neck of his bass guitar as if he might swing it club style at any moment to subdue some stray bear. The thick width of his shoulders and the ink on his muscular arms made my fingers itch with the need to explore. It couldn't have been healthy, but I'm pretty damn sure my heart skipped a beat. Every inch of me vibrated with some sort of hyper, crazy sexual tension courtesy of his presence. Never before had just the sight of a man made me go so gaga.

1m5omyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1m5omyz/help_with_weird_space/,Help with weird space,"Hi, everyone! So I have a bit of a weird space in my new living room, between the couch and the armchair. The previous owners had a similar set up, but with a bookshelf dividing the space (last two pictures). I think it worked for them because they had an L shaped couch that didn't get lost behind the bookshelf, and a much smaller dinning table. I have tried to look for something similar, but eventually decided against it as it would hide the couch and anyone seating on it, plus I don't like the look of the books from the other side. 

I also have considered a smaller bookshelf, to create a sort of reading nook, but it's impossible to find one that isn't taller than the couch or much smaller. Now, I was thinking about putting a floor lamp there and maybe a small coffee table between them, but that still doesn't feel quite right, so I come to you looking for ideas. Or maybe it would look fine as it is, with some art on the wall behind it? Thank you all in advance and have a lovely day! 

P.S.: Also, if anyone feels up for it, ideas for the corner next to the window, behind the couch, would be much appreciated!

Bookshelf/cabinet:
I’d like to buy a large cabinet with a bookshelf top (see samples photos 5-8) for the wall where the desk is currently, which will be removed. We want a piece with deep cabinets at the bottom for toys/etc storage and a combo of books, knick-knacks and bins on top. The space is 90” wide and door height is 82”. 

What color, whether wood or white, should we go with? You’ll notice we have a mix of wood in the room already. Any ideas on a specific cabinet to go with? Our walls and ceilings are Swiss Coffee color. We’d like to spend under $1000. I’ve also been perusing FB marketplace and such. Needs to be ready to go, we don’t have the energy to refinish or paint.

Any other design advice for the room in general/ things you would do?


Things to note:
- we have a second matching green chair coming.
- we need to painting on the green wall and install a wall sconce (see last photo) and have a bar wall sconce coming for above the tv. Those placements were existing. 
- we have a 3 week old baby and two dogs. I will never have a high design home, but trying to not lose my vision completely. The dog kennel end table was challenging for me to accept lol. I like a comfy mid-century feel. Our house was built in 1960.
- we went with a smaller rug as the room gets a lot of traffic with the entry door and garage door on the other end of the room.

Dunkin and Starbucks are more money of course, but still cheaper than the local shops and deliver a better product. Every time I get iced coffee from a local shop it’s always hot or lukewarm coffee poured over ice so the ice melts and waters it down or theres not just enough ice to begin with, or the straw is made of paper or something else dumb that ruins it.

So i left iloilo for 7 years and returned thinking it’d be lowkey. Instead, Iloilo  decided to turn into a walking Pinterest board while i was gone. these places helped me cope. or maybe they made me worse. hard to tell, but the vibes are immaculate. anyway, here’s the list before I ghost everyone and become folklore.

madge cafe – sip that native coffee like it’s laced with backstory. brewed old-school in kettle pots older than your family drama. 
every cup = flashback. 

kapehan sa solo and molo plaza – the Iloilo starter pack for main characters in their emotionally unstable, book-reading, iced coffee era. Sip strong coffee like it’s a coping mechanism at Kapehan sa Molo, then wander to Molo Plaza to stare at stone Greek goddesses who look like they’ve seen your worst decisions and aren’t surprised. Perfect for soft breakdowns in colonial architecture and quietly falling in love with someone who reads Jose Rizal for fun.

esplanade – the enchanted path where plot twists unfold and character development gets cardio. sunsets hit different here—like the city’s apologizing for your bad taste in people. go forth, fair traveler. the river won’t fix your life, but it will make your reflection look 12% deeper than you actually are.
bonus: great lighting for IG stories with vague captions like “learning to let go"".

book latte – It’s giving: part café, part library, all soft chaos. Come act like a tortured poet (who should probably do laundry) and subtly flex on the guy reading Murakami.

sm rooftop samgyup – solo grilling is peak villain origin story. up there, it’s windy, chaotic, and the view of the city screams season finale energy. flip meat like you flip situationships. don’t look around. you’re the moment.

calle real – heritage core. old buildings, pastel panic, and thrift stores with clothes that probably lived more lives than you. the streets are vintage, the energy is cinematic, and the fishball? spiritual.
extra point if you stare into traffic mid-bite like you just realized you are the red flag.

ILOMOCA – perfect for pretending to process abstract art while actually processing your breakup from 3 years ago.
Walk slow. Breathe deep. Gaslight yourself into calling it healing.

muelle loney port view – go here at dusk and stare at docked ships like you’re waiting for someone who’s never coming back. perfect for a dramatic windblown scene and soft crying in silence.

maritime museum – aka the place where you stare at ancient boats and realize you, too, have no direction. Set inside a colonial building that looks like it knows your secrets, this museum has ship models, old maps, and navigation tools that have seen more action than your situationship. It’s free, airconned, and filled with just enough guilt and grandeur to make you feel smart for once. Come in for “history.” Stay because you're emotionally shipwrecked and the lighting makes your breakdowns look aesthetic.

anyway, before you stage an intervention or send me unsolicited self-help podcasts—relax. I’m not spiraling (at least not publicly). I’m just writing in character, channeling the collective energy of every mysterious tita, art student, and emotionally wrecked stranger I’ve side-eyed on a plaza bench.

Iloilo didn’t break me, it just handed me enough ambiance to process my own lore like a tragic side character with great lighting. These aren’t just places; they’re healing spots for the emotionally unstable but self-aware. 

enjoy the list. romanticize responsibly. or don't. who cares.

Whether it's tagging a mod when things go sideways, avoiding off-topic rants (**save it for therapy**, not Violet’s burner), or keeping posts ad-free (Ray cannot support your Etsy.)

Thanks for sticking around and helping this space evolve into something Jody might actually join voluntarily

This are the new rules:

1. Great, you made Wendy cry 

> When you think everyone is being an asshole, that's because maybe you are the asshole. Be nice.

2. Ray can't support this post

> Share the love for Mom, not your side hustle. Keep posts on topic and ad-free.

3. Get off the cross, we need the wood  
     
> While many of us have personal experiences with addiction, this subreddit is not a space for personal therapy or emotionally charged venting. Let's keep discussions respectful, inclusive, and focused on the show.

4. Save it for Marjorie's coffee group  

> Off topic, unrelated.

5. Not in front of the sub, Bonnie  

> No hate nor harassment.

6. Violet wouldn't post that  

> Low effort posts, over posted topics/memes

7. Mods aren't psychic  

> See something off? Tag a mod. We can't fix what we don't know about.

8. Jill's burner accounts aren't welcome

> No fake accounts, vote manipulation, or shady behavior

9. Adam banned spoiler shots at the bar  

> The spoiler flair exists for a reason, please use it.

1m5ojcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1m5ojcf/explore_best_electric_kettle_aroma_awk1810sd_and/,Explore Best Electric Kettle AROMA AWK-1810SD and Is It Worth It,"A kettle is such a simple thing, but the AROMA AWK-1810SD made me reconsider what I thought I needed from one. My mornings usually involve juggling multiple tasks—brewing tea, prepping breakfast, and tackling emails all at the same time. Having tested this electric kettle is like finding a helpful assistant in the kitchen. The first time I switched it on, I was impressed by how quickly it boiled water, thanks to the extra-high 1500-watt power. It's almost ridiculously fast. One moment you're filling it with water, and by the time you're back from grabbing a mug, it's ready.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Whoever designed this electric kettle deserves an applause for blending good looks and functionality. Made of stainless steel, it feels both sturdy and modern. It’s not overly bulky, which is important since counter space is always a premium in my kitchen. The cordless pouring design is a true gem—no more awkwardly tilting the kettle around to serve. It just lifts off smoothly, making it perfect for hosting or those lazy ""serve-yourself"" moments when everybody in the family wants their cup of tea differently. I also appreciated the built-in removable tea filter, especially when I’m brewing loose-leaf tea. It’s not something I thought I’d need until I used it.

**Ease of Use and Programmable Features**  
What's the deal with programmable kettles? I used to think they were just a fancy word for ""more buttons to press,"" but the digital controls on this one are intuitive and oddly satisfying. You can customize the temperature to fit whatever you're making—be it delicate teas, instant coffee, or even boiling water for instant noodles. I mean, who knew exact temperature control could geek me out like this? The Keep Warm mode is another feature that’s particularly handy. I once got caught up in a long work call, and my water stayed at the perfect temperature for an hour. That saved me the annoyance of reheating, so huge thumbs up there.  

[Check AROMA AWK-1810SD price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b09zkhhky8/)  

**Performance in Everyday Use**  
Over the few weeks I’ve been using it, this electric kettle has proven to be consistent. Rapid boiling, as promised, is truly a thing. It doesn’t mess around when it comes to boiling water quickly, even when it’s filled to its 1.7-liter capacity. Of course, the automatic shut-off gave me peace of mind. I’ve had moments where I was paranoid about whether I remembered to turn off the stove; with this kettle, no such worry exists. One neat surprise? It’s incredibly quiet compared to some kettles, which seem like they’re auditioning for a role in a jet engine factory. 

**Boons**  
- Robust stainless steel build with a sleek, polished look  
- Cordless design ensures hassle-free and smooth serving  
- Digital controls allow precise temperature customization  
- Rapid boiling saves time during busy schedules  
- Keep Warm feature is perfect for multitaskers and forgetful tea drinkers  

**Caveats**  
- Fingerprints smudge easily on the stainless steel exterior and can take away from the tidy look  
- Slightly challenging to clean the inside, especially where the edges are curved  
- The LED glow around the buttons doesn’t turn off when plugged in, which could annoy some people  

**Product Contenders**  
Let’s talk about competitors because, surely, this can’t be the only kettle out there. One of the more popular models I compared with it was the Hamilton Beach 1.7L. That one, while solid, lacked some of the sleek aesthetics and programmable features I got used to here. Its main selling point was simplicity, but honestly, being without a Keep Warm mode felt like stepping back in time. Another competing product was the Cuisinart CPK-17, which does have similar temperature control options. However, with a higher price tag and some bulkier dimensions, I still prefer the compact and efficient design of the AROMA model. If speed and cost-efficiency matter to you, this kettle has an edge. 

**Worth Every Penny**  
Electric kettles like this are tricky—do you really need to spend extra for bells and whistles? Turns out, here, you might. While it’s not the cheapest option, it offers fantastic value for its features. Rapid boiling means it saves me time every day, and honestly, time can be priceless when I’m rushing to get on with the day. And then there’s the flexibility offered by things like Keep Warm and programmable digital control, which make it far more than your average kettle. Added convenience for the price? I’ll take that trade any day.

I’m working on a novella about a 17-year-old girl with a strange gift...she can sense when people are near death. After her mother’s suicide, she moves to a foggy coastal town where a lighthouse keeper helps the dying… and something darker is watching from the rocks.

It’s literary, atmospheric, and a little strange - think *Kafka on the Shore* meets *The Ocean at the End of the Lane*. This is the first few chapters. Would love any reads, reactions, or thoughts!

Thanks for reading

**Chapter 1: Calla**

The bus to Meridian Bay smelled of salt and diesel, carrying seventeen-year-old Calla Thorne away from everything she'd ever known. Calla pressed her forehead against the window, watching California's coastline blur past in shades of gray that matched her mood perfectly. In her backpack, nestled between a change of clothes and her mother's suicide note, was a single cassette tape labeled ""For Difficult Mornings"" in her mother's careful handwriting.

She had listened to it exactly once, three days after the funeral. It contained the same song recorded seventeen times: ""The Way You Look Tonight,"" sung by her mother in the kitchen on some forgotten Sunday morning. Each version slightly different—sometimes humming the bridge, sometimes adding words that weren't in the original. By the seventh repetition, Calla understood that her mother had been practicing for something she would never perform.

The other passengers dozed or stared at their phones with the  exhaustion of people traveling toward uncertainty. Calla noticed the old woman three rows up had been holding her breath for longer intervals over the past hour. Not consciously—just the way people do when their bodies are rehearsing for something final. The businessman with the coffee stain on his tie kept touching his left arm in a way that suggested his heart was sending him messages he wasn't ready to receive.

Calla had learned not to mention these observations to anyone. Dr. Martinez had called it ""hypervigilance stemming from trauma,"" prescribing pills that made the world feel wrapped in cotton but never quite silenced the frequency she seemed tuned to—the one that broadcast endings before they happened.

The bus shuddered to a stop in Meridian Bay just as the sun began its descent into the Pacific. Through the scratched window, Calla could see a town that looked like it had been assembled from the spare parts of other, more decisive places. A coffee shop with hand-painted signs sat next to a hotel with half its letters missing. New construction jutted up against buildings that seemed to be slowly returning to the sea.

She shouldered her backpack and stepped onto cracked pavement that smelled of salt and something else—something like the moment before music begins, when the conductor raises his baton and the entire orchestra holds its breath.

The address on the folded paper in her pocket led her three blocks inland to a narrow house painted the color of sea glass. Mrs. Chen, her father's cousin's friend's mother-in-law, had offered her a room for the summer in exchange for ""light household duties and good company."" Calla suspected Mrs. Chen was the type of person who collected strays—broken people and injured birds and plants that everyone else had given up on.

The house smelled like jasmine tea and old wood. Mrs. Chen was exactly as Calla had imagined: tiny and efficient, with hands that moved like small birds when she spoke. She showed Calla to a room on the second floor that contained a single bed, a desk facing the window, and a bookshelf filled with novels in three different languages.

""You eat dinner at six,"" Mrs. Chen said, not asking if Calla would be hungry. ""The library stays open until nine on weekdays. The beach is good for walking when your thoughts are too loud.""

Calla unpacked her few belongings, placing the cassette tape on the windowsill where the evening light could touch it. From her window, she could see the town spreading out toward the water, and beyond that, a lighthouse standing like a white exclamation point against the darkening sky.

She walked to the library as the streetlights began to flicker on, noticing a silver-blue cat watching her from across the street. Its eyes caught the light like diamonds, and for a moment, she had the strange feeling it was evaluating her somehow. When she blinked, it had disappeared into the shadows between buildings.

The library was smaller than the ones she'd known in the city, but there was something about the way the light spilled from its windows that reminded her of safety. Inside, the silence had weight and texture, like the inside of a seashell.

The librarian was perhaps thirty, with the kind of face that suggested they had read every book in the building and had thoughtful opinions about all of them. They looked up as Calla entered, and for a moment, something passed between them—recognition, perhaps, though they had never met.

""First time in Meridian Bay?"" the librarian asked, their voice carrying the cadence of someone who already knew the answer.

""Yes."" Calla found herself moving toward the music section without conscious decision. ""I'm staying for the summer.""

""Ah."" The librarian returned to their work, but Calla sensed she was still being observed. ""The classical collection is on the third shelf. Jazz is mixed in with folk, I'm afraid. Previous librarian believed genres were artificial boundaries—said Coltrane and Chopin were having the same conversation, just in different languages."" They paused, considering something. ""Turns out she wasn't wrong. Music doesn't really care about our filing systems.""

Calla ran her fingers along the spines of CDs and vinyl records that looked like they had been loved by many hands. She selected a recording of Chopin nocturnes—not because she ly wanted to hear them, but because the case had a small crack in the plastic that reminded her of everything beautiful and broken in the world.

As she settled into a chair near the window, she noticed an elderly man at a corner table, reading the same page of a book for the third time. His breathing had the shallowness that meant his body was preparing to let go, probably within the week. He looked peaceful, which was something.

Calla put on the headphones and let Chopin fill the spaces in her head where her mother's voice used to live. Outside, the lighthouse beam swept across the water in steady intervals, and for the first time since arriving in Meridian Bay, she allowed herself to think that perhaps she had found a place where endings could be beautiful rather than tragic.

She did not yet know that someone else in town made his living shepherding those endings, or that something else entirely fed on the moments when death came as a surprise. All she knew was that the music was lovely, the library felt safe, and tomorrow she would begin the work of learning how to live in a world where her mother's voice existed only on cassette tape, singing the same song seventeen different ways.

The snail appeared on the windowsill just as the last movement ended, leaving a silver trail that caught the library's fluorescent light like a signature on something important.

 **Chapter 2: The Lighthouse Keeper**

Thomas Hale had been tending the Meridian Bay lighthouse for seven years, though he'd been shepherding the dying for much longer—since he was fourteen, when his mother passed. Most days it felt like seven lifetimes. The lighthouse itself was automated—had been since the late eighties—but the Coast Guard still required someone to maintain the equipment and file reports about weather conditions and marine traffic. What they didn't require, and what Thomas never mentioned in his reports, was his other job: shepherding the dying.

It wasn't something he'd chosen or trained for. It simply was, the way some people were naturally good with children or had perfect pitch. Animals found him when their time was near. So did people, though they rarely understood why they felt compelled to climb the winding path to the lighthouse in their final days.

Thomas kept a journal of these encounters—not out of morbidity, but because someone should remember. The entries were brief, factual: ""June 12th - Harbor seal, old male, kidney failure. Stayed with him two hours by the north rocks. Three snails appeared afterward, perfect spiral formation."" The snails were something he'd never quite understood, but they came after every peaceful death, as if nature needed to sign its name to something well done.

This Tuesday morning started like most others. Coffee at 5:47 AM, exactly three minutes before sunrise. Weather report filed by 6:15. Equipment check completed by 6:30. Then the walk around the lighthouse grounds, looking for any animals that might have sought him out during the night.

 He found the cat near the generator shed.

It was a tabby he'd seen around town—belonged to the Hendersons, if he remembered correctly. The cat looked up at him with eyes that held that  quality of resignation that meant the end was close. Not today, probably not tomorrow, but soon.

 ""Hello there,"" Thomas said softly, crouching down. The cat approached without hesitation, as they always did, and settled against his legs with a purr that sounded like distant thunder.

Thomas sat on the damp grass and let the cat arrange itself in his lap. This was the part that never got easier—the waiting. He'd learned to recognize the signs: the stillness that came over animals in their final hours, the way their breathing shifted from effort to acceptance. But this cat wasn't there yet. It had simply come to introduce itself, to establish the connection that would matter when the time came.

 As he sat there, Thomas became aware of being watched.

It was a feeling he'd grown accustomed to over the past few months, though he'd never been able to identify its source. A presence at the edge of his vision, gone whenever he turned to look directly. He'd begun to wonder if the isolation was affecting him more than he'd realized. Lighthouse keepers had gone mad before—it was practically a job requirement in the old stories.

 The cat stirred in his lap, its purr faltering for a moment. Animals were sensitive to things humans couldn't perceive. Thomas had learned to trust their instincts.

 ""You feel it too, don't you?"" he murmured, stroking the cat's head. ""Something's different lately.""

The sensation of being observed intensified, and Thomas found himself scanning the tree line that bordered the lighthouse property. Nothing moved except the branches in the morning breeze, but the feeling persisted—a weight of attention that made his skin crawl.

The cat suddenly went rigid, its claws digging into Thomas's jeans. For a moment, the world seemed to hold its breath. Even the ever-present sound of waves against the rocks below seemed muffled, distant. The lighthouse beam, in its steady rotation, seemed to slow—each sweep taking impossibly long, the light itself growing thick like honey. Thomas watched his own shadow stretch and bend in ways that defied the beam's angle, reaching toward something he couldn't see. Then, as quickly as it had come, the sensation passed. The light resumed its normal pace, shadows fell where they should, and the cat relaxed, began purring again.

Thomas looked around once more, seeing nothing unusual, but the unease remained. He'd experienced something similar three times in the past month, always in the presence of a dying animal. A wrongness in the air, as if something was watching not just him, but the act of dying itself.

He stayed with the cat until it decided to leave, which it did with the abrupt decisiveness cats were known for. It walked to the edge of the lighthouse clearing, turned back to look at him once—a promise, he knew, that it would return when the time was right—then disappeared into the underbrush.

Thomas spent the rest of the morning updating his log and checking the lighthouse lens assembly. The work was methodical, soothing, but he couldn't shake the feeling that something fundamental had shifted. The very air around the lighthouse felt charged, expectant.

At noon, he walked into town for supplies. Meridian Bay was small enough that everyone knew everyone, at least by sight. Thomas nodded to the usual faces: Mrs. Patterson walking her ancient poodle, Jake from the bait shop heading to lunch, the new girl from the library selecting produce at the farmer's market with the care of someone for whom every dollar mattered.

He'd noticed her the day before, walking past the lighthouse path around sunset. Young, maybe seventeen or eighteen, with the kind of careful posture that suggested she was carrying more weight than should be visible. There was something familiar about her, though he was certain they'd never met. Perhaps it was simply that she had the look of someone who understood that the world contained more sorrow than most people were willing to acknowledge.

 As he paid for groceries, Mrs. Patterson approached with her usual concern for his well-being.

 ""Thomas, dear, you're looking tired. Are you sleeping enough out there all by yourself?""

 ""I'm fine, Mrs. Patterson. Just a busy few days.""

""Well, you know you're always welcome for dinner. Harold makes enough pot roast for an army."" She paused, studying his face with the intensity of someone who'd raised six children and recognized trouble when she saw it. ""You haven't been having those... visits... more frequently, have you?""

Mrs. Patterson was one of the few people in town who knew about his gift, having sought him out herself when her husband was dying two years prior. She never spoke about it directly, but she understood.

 

""A few,"" Thomas admitted. ""Nothing unusual.""

But even as he said it, he knew it wasn't entirely true. Something was unusual. Something was watching him, following him, drawn to the same moments of transition that had become his responsibility to shepherd. And whatever it was, it didn't feel benevolent.

 That evening, as the automated light began its nightly rotation, Thomas sat on the lighthouse gallery and opened his journal to a fresh page. He wrote the date, then paused, pen hovering over paper. How do you record a feeling? How do you document the sensation of being hunted by something you can't see?

 Finally, he wrote: ""Tuesday, June 15th - Tabby cat, early stages. Something else present, watching. Unknown presence growing stronger.""

 He closed the journal and looked out over the water, where the lighthouse beam swept across waves that reflected starlight like scattered diamonds. Somewhere in town, he knew, people were living their ordinary lives, unaware that their deaths might be attended by something other than the gentle shepherd they'd grown accustomed to.

 A snail made its way slowly across the gallery railing, leaving a silver trail that caught the lighthouse beam. Thomas watched it with something approaching relief. Whatever was stalking him, the snails still came after the peaceful deaths. Nature's small blessing was still intact.

For now.

**Chapter 3: Cassandra**

 The Meridian Bay Public Library became Calla's sanctuary over the next three days, a refuge that felt more like home than anywhere she'd lived since her mother's death. She arrived each morning at nine, when the librarian—who had introduced themselves simply as River—unlocked the heavy wooden doors that still bore the original brass hardware from the building's construction in 1923. The library had been built during the town's brief prosperity as a lumber port, its stone foundation and cedar shingles designed to withstand the coastal storms that could turn the Pacific into a wall of gray fury.

Mrs. Chen seemed to understand this need for refuge without requiring explanation. Each morning, she packed Calla's lunch in a brown paper bag that always contained something unexpected - a thermos of soup that tasted like comfort, a piece of fruit that was perfectly ripe, a cookie wrapped in wax paper with a fortune written in Mrs. Chen's careful handwriting: ""Today you will discover something that has been waiting for you to find it.""

River had the  quality of someone who understood that libraries were meant for more than books. They moved through the stacks with the quiet efficiency of a priest tending an altar, reshelving returns and straightening displays with an attention to detail that bordered on reverence. The building itself seemed to respond to their care - dust motes spiraling in shafts of sunlight, the old wooden floors creaking a gentle welcome to each visitor, the very air holding the accumulated wisdom of decades spent in the service of knowledge.

When River spoke, which wasn't often, their voice carried the slight rasp of someone who spent most of their time in comfortable silence. They had a way of appearing at exactly the moment when Calla needed a new book, materializing beside her chair with an armload of volumes that somehow matched her mood perfectly. Poetry when she felt restless, memoirs when she needed to remember that other people had survived impossible losses, scientific texts when she wanted to lose herself in facts that couldn't argue with her grief.

The library's collection reflected the eclectic tastes of a century's worth of librarians and donors. Maritime histories sat next to feminist manifestos, their spines worn smooth by countless hands. Children's picture books shared shelf space with graduate-level treatises on marine biology, creating a democracy of knowledge that suggested all curiosity was equally valid. The fiction section sprawled across three rooms, organized not by alphabet but by what River called ""emotional geography"" - books that belonged together because they spoke to similar hungers, similar forms of loneliness.

""You're reading about death,"" River observed on Thursday afternoon, noting the stack of books Calla had accumulated over the past few days: Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, Joan Didion, mythology texts about psychopomps and guides between worlds. The afternoon light slanted through the tall windows, casting everything in a golden haze that made the dust motes look like tiny spirits dancing in the air.

""I suppose I am."" Calla didn't look up from her notebook, where she'd been copying down passages that resonated with something deep in her chest. Her handwriting had become smaller, more careful, as if she were transcribing sacred texts that required precision. ""Is that strange?""

""Not ly. Death is one of the most popular subjects in any library—people just disguise it as biography, history, medicine, religion."" River sat down across from her, their movements careful and deliberate. The chair they chose was one of the library's originals, a solid oak piece that had been reupholstered so many times it had developed a patina of comfort that spoke to generations of readers seeking solace. ""The question is whether you're reading about death or reading about grief. They're cousins, but they don't live in the same house.""

Calla considered this, looking up from her notebook for the first time in an hour. Her eyes felt dry from reading, and she blinked several times to refocus on River's face. There was something in their expression that suggested they spoke from experience, a quality of careful attention that came from having navigated their own relationship with loss.

""What's the difference?""

""Death is universal. Grief is personal."" River traced a pattern on the table with their finger—spirals, Calla noticed, like the trails snails left behind. The table itself was scarred with decades of use, its surface marked by coffee rings and pen marks and the invisible residue of countless conversations about books that had changed people's lives. ""Death follows rules—biological, inevitable, surprisingly punctual. Grief is jazz improvisation played by someone who's never learned to read music.""

The metaphor settled into the space between them like dust finding its place in afternoon light. Calla could hear the truth in it—death as clockwork, grief as chaos pretending to have rhythm. She thought of her mother's final weeks, how Calla had been able to predict the approaching end with scientific precision while remaining completely unprepared for the aftermath, the way grief moved through her like weather she couldn't forecast.

There was something in River's tone that suggested they spoke from experience. Calla found herself studying their face, noting the way they held their mouth when discussing difficult subjects—as if words had weight and needed to be balanced carefully before being released into the world. Their hands were ink-stained, she noticed, not from pens but from the kind of old printing that came from handling books that had been printed decades ago, when ink was still wet enough to leave traces.

""Which one are you here for?"" River asked.

The question should have felt intrusive, but it didn't. Perhaps it was the library's atmosphere—the way centuries of seekers had come here with questions they couldn't ask anywhere else—or perhaps River had the gift of making personal inquiries feel like natural conversation. The building itself seemed to encourage honesty, its stone walls thick enough to hold secrets, its windows positioned to catch light without revealing too much of the interior to passersby.

Calla found herself answering honestly, the words coming out before she could second-guess them. ""Both, I think. My mother died three months ago. Suicide."" The word still felt sharp in her mouth, like swallowing glass, but it came easier here than it had anywhere else. ""I keep thinking if I understand death better, I might understand why.""

River nodded, unsurprised. They had the  stillness of someone who had heard many confessions in this place, who understood that libraries were secular cathedrals where people came to wrestle with questions that had no easy answers. ""Suicide complicates grief. Makes it feel like a song that ends mid-phrase—you keep waiting for the resolution that never comes.""

""Yes."" Calla felt something loosen in her chest, a tension she hadn't realized she was carrying. ""Exactly like that.""

They sat in comfortable silence for a while, surrounded by the library's quiet—not empty silence, but full silence, weighted with the presence of thousands of stories waiting to be discovered. The building held its breath around them, afternoon light shifting through the windows as the sun moved across the sky. Outside, she could hear the distant sound of waves against the harbor walls, a rhythm so constant it had become part of the town's heartbeat.

Through the windows, afternoon fog was beginning to roll in from the ocean, softening the edges of the visible world. Meridian Bay had a relationship with fog that bordered on the mystical—it appeared and disappeared according to its own logic, sometimes revealing views that seemed impossible, sometimes concealing landmarks that should have been obvious. The fog transformed the town into something dreamlike, a place where ordinary rules seemed negotiable.

""There's an old man who comes in every Tuesday and Friday,"" River said eventually, their voice dropping to match the library's reverent quiet. ""Harold Morrison. Retired professor. He always sits at the corner table, reads the same book.""

Calla looked toward the corner table, where the elderly man she'd noticed on her first day was indeed reading, his breathing still carrying that shallowness she'd learned to recognize. He wore the same cardigan he'd worn every day she'd seen him, a brown wool garment that had been carefully mended at the elbows. His reading glasses caught the afternoon light, creating small prisms that danced across the open pages.

""What book?"" she asked.

""Neruda's poetry. The same collection, for three years now. Never checks it out, never reads anything else."" River's voice dropped slightly, as if they were sharing something sacred. ""His wife used to read it to him. She died four years ago. Cancer.""

""He comes here to remember her.""

""Or to say goodbye."" River studied Calla's face with an intensity that made her suddenly self-conscious. Their eyes held the same quality of careful observation she'd noticed in Mrs. Chen, as if they were accustomed to seeing things that others might miss. ""You noticed something about him, didn't you? The first day you came in.""

Calla's pulse quickened. She'd learned to be careful about her observations, to keep them vague enough that people could dismiss them as intuition rather than something more specific. The pills Dr. Martinez had prescribed sat unused in her backpack for a reason—she'd discovered that the cotton-wrapped world they created was worse than the sharp clarity of knowing too much.

""He seems... tired,"" she said carefully, choosing words that could mean anything or nothing.

""Tired how?""

The question hung in the air between them like incense, heavy with implication. Calla found herself caught between the truth and the safer lie she'd been telling for years. River waited without pressure, their expression neutral but attentive, as if they understood that some answers couldn't be rushed.

Outside, the fog had thickened enough to muffle the sounds of the town, creating a cocoon of silence around the library. Even the seagulls seemed quieter, their cries distant and dreamlike. The afternoon light took on the quality that came with coastal fog, softer and more diffuse, as if the world had been wrapped in gauze.

""The way people get when they're preparing to stop,"" Calla said finally, the words coming out in a rush before she could reconsider them. ""When their bodies are getting ready to let go.""

River didn't look surprised. Instead, they nodded slowly, as if she'd confirmed something they'd already suspected. Their reaction was so calm, so accepting, that Calla wondered if she'd finally found someone who might understand what it meant to carry knowledge that no one wanted to hear.

""How long?"" River asked, their voice gentle but matter-of-fact.

""Soon. Days, maybe a week.""

""And you've always been able to sense this?""

Calla nodded, waiting for the familiar sequence: disbelief, concern, suggestions for therapy, the careful distance that people maintained when confronted with something they couldn't categorize. Instead, River leaned back in their chair and smiled—not the indulgent smile adults gave children with overactive imaginations, but the recognition smile of someone meeting a kindred spirit.

""There are more of us than you might think,"" River said quietly. ""People who see the spaces between what is and what's coming. Who feel the world's pulse a few beats ahead of everyone else."" They paused, their expression growing more thoughtful. ""My gift is different from yours—I see the spaces between what is and what's coming. Not death itself, but the moments when reality becomes... negotiable. When choices could tip either direction.""

""Us?""

""Sensitives. Oracles. Cassandras."" River's smile turned rueful, tinged with the sadness that came from understanding both the gift and the burden. ""People cursed to know things they can't change.""

The word hit Calla like a physical blow, resonating in her chest like a struck bell. Cassandra. She'd read about her in one of her mythology books just that morning—the Trojan princess blessed with prophecy but cursed never to be believed. The parallel was so obvious she wondered why she'd never made the connection before. All those years of trying to warn people, of being dismissed as traumatized or oversensitive or simply wrong, suddenly made sense in the context of an ancient curse that turned gift into burden.

""You think I'm like her?""

""I think you know things you wish you didn't know. I think you've tried to warn people and been dismissed as traumatized or oversensitive. I think you came to Meridian Bay because you're tired of being the only one in the room who can hear the orchestra tuning up.""

River's words settled into the space around them like dust motes finding their places in shafts of sunlight. For the first time since her mother's death, Calla felt the possibility that she might not be broken or crazy or suffering from elaborate grief delusions. There was a word for what she was, a tradition, a community of people who had carried similar burdens throughout history.

""Is there a way to make it stop?"" she asked, though she wasn't sure she really wanted to know the answer.

""Would you want it to?""

Calla started to say yes, then hesitated. The ability to sense approaching death was terrible, but it was also the last connection she had to her mother—the thing that had made her special in her mother's eyes, even if no one else believed it existed. Giving it up would mean losing the final thread that connected her to the person who had understood her best.

""I don't know,"" she admitted.

""Good answer."" River stood, gathering the books Calla had been reading with the careful reverence of someone who understood that knowledge was sacred, regardless of how difficult it might be to bear. ""Truth is, gifts like yours don't come with off switches. But they do come with volume controls. Understanding changes the frequency—doesn't make it go away, just makes it more bearable to live with.""

As River moved away to reshelve the books, Calla found herself looking again at Harold Morrison. He turned a page without reading it, his attention focused somewhere beyond the printed words. She could see the exact moment when his breathing shifted—not stopping, but changing rhythm, like a clock winding down. The afternoon light caught his reading glasses again, creating small rainbows that danced across the poetry he was no longer really seeing.

She pulled out her phone and did something she'd never done before: she texted the library's main number with a message for River. ""Should call Harold Morrison's family tonight. Just in case.""

River's phone buzzed in their pocket. They read the message, looked at Calla with an expression that mixed sorrow and recognition, then walked quietly to the reference desk and made a phone call. Calla couldn't hear the words, but she could see the careful concern in River's posture, the way they spoke in the tone reserved for difficult conversations that might save someone from unexpected grief.

When River returned, they sat down beside her rather than across from her, a gesture of solidarity that felt more significant than any words could have been.

""Harold's daughter lives in San Francisco. She's been meaning to visit."" River's voice was gentle, carrying the weight of someone who understood the delicate balance between hope and acceptance. ""I suggested this weekend might be a good time.""

""You believe me.""

""I believe that some people are born with their ears tuned to frequencies most others can't access. I believe that gifts like yours exist for a reason, even when that reason feels more like punishment than blessing.""

Outside, the fog had thickened, turning the world beyond the library windows into something soft and indistinct. A silver-blue cat appeared briefly on the windowsill, its diamond-bright eyes meeting Calla's for just a moment before it padded away. The elderly man continued his careful reading, unaware that his time was being measured in days rather than years, unaware that a seventeen-year-old girl across the room was carrying the weight of his approaching ending.

""There are things in this town,"" River said quietly, their voice taking on the quality of someone sharing a secret that had been kept for generations, ""that you should know about. Things that might help you understand why you're here, why your gift led you to this place.""

""What kind of things?""

River glanced around the empty library, then leaned closer. The afternoon light had shifted again, creating pools of shadow between the stacks that seemed deeper than they should have been. ""The kind that exist in the spaces between what people can see and what they're willing to believe. Meridian Bay sits on a threshold, Calla. Between the ordinary world and something else entirely—like a doorway that only opens when someone with the right key walks by.""

""Something else like what?""

""Like a place where warnings echo when they go unheard. Where the weight of unheeded prophecy gathers until it becomes something more than memory."" River paused, studying her face with the intensity of someone trying to gauge whether she was ready for a truth that would change everything. ""Are you ready to learn about the Mirror Coast?""

The words hit Calla like recognition—not because she'd heard them before, but because they felt like coming home to a place she'd never been. Outside, a snail appeared on the library window, leaving its silver trail against the glass like a signature on something important. The trail caught the afternoon light, creating patterns that looked almost like writing in a language she'd never learned but somehow understood.

""Yes,"" she said, her voice steady despite the way her heart was racing. ""I'm ready.""",1,1753117373.0,Wattpad,1,1.0,False

Secondly, Amy knew how to swim, and very well so. If she had fallen in, she wouldn’t have died instantly, it’s water not concrete. She would have screamed for help, and someone on the ship would have heard her. It’s worth noting that the balcony door in her cabin was open. Even if no one heard her screams, she could have potentially swum to shore, it wasn’t that far.

Lastly, even if, for some reason, she couldn’t swim or lost consciousness and drowned, her body would likely have been found shortly after. The ship was near the port, not out in the middle of the ocean. Her body would’ve washed ashore or been discovered during the search some hours later.

I’m working on a novella about a 17-year-old girl with a strange gift...she can sense when people are near death. After her mother’s suicide, she moves to a foggy coastal town where a lighthouse keeper helps the dying… and something darker is watching from the rocks.

It’s literary, atmospheric, and a little strange - think *Kafka on the Shore* meets *The Ocean at the End of the Lane*. This is the first few chapters. Would love any reads, reactions, or thoughts!

Thanks for reading

**Chapter 1: Calla**

The bus to Meridian Bay smelled of salt and diesel, carrying seventeen-year-old Calla Thorne away from everything she'd ever known. Calla pressed her forehead against the window, watching California's coastline blur past in shades of gray that matched her mood perfectly. In her backpack, nestled between a change of clothes and her mother's suicide note, was a single cassette tape labeled ""For Difficult Mornings"" in her mother's careful handwriting.

She had listened to it exactly once, three days after the funeral. It contained the same song recorded seventeen times: ""The Way You Look Tonight,"" sung by her mother in the kitchen on some forgotten Sunday morning. Each version slightly different—sometimes humming the bridge, sometimes adding words that weren't in the original. By the seventh repetition, Calla understood that her mother had been practicing for something she would never perform.

The other passengers dozed or stared at their phones with the  exhaustion of people traveling toward uncertainty. Calla noticed the old woman three rows up had been holding her breath for longer intervals over the past hour. Not consciously—just the way people do when their bodies are rehearsing for something final. The businessman with the coffee stain on his tie kept touching his left arm in a way that suggested his heart was sending him messages he wasn't ready to receive.

Calla had learned not to mention these observations to anyone. Dr. Martinez had called it ""hypervigilance stemming from trauma,"" prescribing pills that made the world feel wrapped in cotton but never quite silenced the frequency she seemed tuned to—the one that broadcast endings before they happened.

The bus shuddered to a stop in Meridian Bay just as the sun began its descent into the Pacific. Through the scratched window, Calla could see a town that looked like it had been assembled from the spare parts of other, more decisive places. A coffee shop with hand-painted signs sat next to a hotel with half its letters missing. New construction jutted up against buildings that seemed to be slowly returning to the sea.

She shouldered her backpack and stepped onto cracked pavement that smelled of salt and something else—something like the moment before music begins, when the conductor raises his baton and the entire orchestra holds its breath.

The address on the folded paper in her pocket led her three blocks inland to a narrow house painted the color of sea glass. Mrs. Chen, her father's cousin's friend's mother-in-law, had offered her a room for the summer in exchange for ""light household duties and good company."" Calla suspected Mrs. Chen was the type of person who collected strays—broken people and injured birds and plants that everyone else had given up on.

The house smelled like jasmine tea and old wood. Mrs. Chen was exactly as Calla had imagined: tiny and efficient, with hands that moved like small birds when she spoke. She showed Calla to a room on the second floor that contained a single bed, a desk facing the window, and a bookshelf filled with novels in three different languages.

""You eat dinner at six,"" Mrs. Chen said, not asking if Calla would be hungry. ""The library stays open until nine on weekdays. The beach is good for walking when your thoughts are too loud.""

Calla unpacked her few belongings, placing the cassette tape on the windowsill where the evening light could touch it. From her window, she could see the town spreading out toward the water, and beyond that, a lighthouse standing like a white exclamation point against the darkening sky.

She walked to the library as the streetlights began to flicker on, noticing a silver-blue cat watching her from across the street. Its eyes caught the light like diamonds, and for a moment, she had the strange feeling it was evaluating her somehow. When she blinked, it had disappeared into the shadows between buildings.

The library was smaller than the ones she'd known in the city, but there was something about the way the light spilled from its windows that reminded her of safety. Inside, the silence had weight and texture, like the inside of a seashell.

The librarian was perhaps thirty, with the kind of face that suggested they had read every book in the building and had thoughtful opinions about all of them. They looked up as Calla entered, and for a moment, something passed between them—recognition, perhaps, though they had never met.

""First time in Meridian Bay?"" the librarian asked, their voice carrying the cadence of someone who already knew the answer.

""Yes."" Calla found herself moving toward the music section without conscious decision. ""I'm staying for the summer.""

""Ah."" The librarian returned to their work, but Calla sensed she was still being observed. ""The classical collection is on the third shelf. Jazz is mixed in with folk, I'm afraid. Previous librarian believed genres were artificial boundaries—said Coltrane and Chopin were having the same conversation, just in different languages."" They paused, considering something. ""Turns out she wasn't wrong. Music doesn't really care about our filing systems.""

Calla ran her fingers along the spines of CDs and vinyl records that looked like they had been loved by many hands. She selected a recording of Chopin nocturnes—not because she ly wanted to hear them, but because the case had a small crack in the plastic that reminded her of everything beautiful and broken in the world.

As she settled into a chair near the window, she noticed an elderly man at a corner table, reading the same page of a book for the third time. His breathing had the shallowness that meant his body was preparing to let go, probably within the week. He looked peaceful, which was something.

Calla put on the headphones and let Chopin fill the spaces in her head where her mother's voice used to live. Outside, the lighthouse beam swept across the water in steady intervals, and for the first time since arriving in Meridian Bay, she allowed herself to think that perhaps she had found a place where endings could be beautiful rather than tragic.

She did not yet know that someone else in town made his living shepherding those endings, or that something else entirely fed on the moments when death came as a surprise. All she knew was that the music was lovely, the library felt safe, and tomorrow she would begin the work of learning how to live in a world where her mother's voice existed only on cassette tape, singing the same song seventeen different ways.

The snail appeared on the windowsill just as the last movement ended, leaving a silver trail that caught the library's fluorescent light like a signature on something important.

 **Chapter 2: The Lighthouse Keeper**

Thomas Hale had been tending the Meridian Bay lighthouse for seven years, though he'd been shepherding the dying for much longer—since he was fourteen, when his mother passed. Most days it felt like seven lifetimes. The lighthouse itself was automated—had been since the late eighties—but the Coast Guard still required someone to maintain the equipment and file reports about weather conditions and marine traffic. What they didn't require, and what Thomas never mentioned in his reports, was his other job: shepherding the dying.

It wasn't something he'd chosen or trained for. It simply was, the way some people were naturally good with children or had perfect pitch. Animals found him when their time was near. So did people, though they rarely understood why they felt compelled to climb the winding path to the lighthouse in their final days.

Thomas kept a journal of these encounters—not out of morbidity, but because someone should remember. The entries were brief, factual: ""June 12th - Harbor seal, old male, kidney failure. Stayed with him two hours by the north rocks. Three snails appeared afterward, perfect spiral formation."" The snails were something he'd never quite understood, but they came after every peaceful death, as if nature needed to sign its name to something well done.

This Tuesday morning started like most others. Coffee at 5:47 AM, exactly three minutes before sunrise. Weather report filed by 6:15. Equipment check completed by 6:30. Then the walk around the lighthouse grounds, looking for any animals that might have sought him out during the night.

 He found the cat near the generator shed.

It was a tabby he'd seen around town—belonged to the Hendersons, if he remembered correctly. The cat looked up at him with eyes that held that  quality of resignation that meant the end was close. Not today, probably not tomorrow, but soon.

 ""Hello there,"" Thomas said softly, crouching down. The cat approached without hesitation, as they always did, and settled against his legs with a purr that sounded like distant thunder.

Thomas sat on the damp grass and let the cat arrange itself in his lap. This was the part that never got easier—the waiting. He'd learned to recognize the signs: the stillness that came over animals in their final hours, the way their breathing shifted from effort to acceptance. But this cat wasn't there yet. It had simply come to introduce itself, to establish the connection that would matter when the time came.

 As he sat there, Thomas became aware of being watched.

It was a feeling he'd grown accustomed to over the past few months, though he'd never been able to identify its source. A presence at the edge of his vision, gone whenever he turned to look directly. He'd begun to wonder if the isolation was affecting him more than he'd realized. Lighthouse keepers had gone mad before—it was practically a job requirement in the old stories.

 The cat stirred in his lap, its purr faltering for a moment. Animals were sensitive to things humans couldn't perceive. Thomas had learned to trust their instincts.

 ""You feel it too, don't you?"" he murmured, stroking the cat's head. ""Something's different lately.""

The sensation of being observed intensified, and Thomas found himself scanning the tree line that bordered the lighthouse property. Nothing moved except the branches in the morning breeze, but the feeling persisted—a weight of attention that made his skin crawl.

The cat suddenly went rigid, its claws digging into Thomas's jeans. For a moment, the world seemed to hold its breath. Even the ever-present sound of waves against the rocks below seemed muffled, distant. The lighthouse beam, in its steady rotation, seemed to slow—each sweep taking impossibly long, the light itself growing thick like honey. Thomas watched his own shadow stretch and bend in ways that defied the beam's angle, reaching toward something he couldn't see. Then, as quickly as it had come, the sensation passed. The light resumed its normal pace, shadows fell where they should, and the cat relaxed, began purring again.

Thomas looked around once more, seeing nothing unusual, but the unease remained. He'd experienced something similar three times in the past month, always in the presence of a dying animal. A wrongness in the air, as if something was watching not just him, but the act of dying itself.

He stayed with the cat until it decided to leave, which it did with the abrupt decisiveness cats were known for. It walked to the edge of the lighthouse clearing, turned back to look at him once—a promise, he knew, that it would return when the time was right—then disappeared into the underbrush.

Thomas spent the rest of the morning updating his log and checking the lighthouse lens assembly. The work was methodical, soothing, but he couldn't shake the feeling that something fundamental had shifted. The very air around the lighthouse felt charged, expectant.

At noon, he walked into town for supplies. Meridian Bay was small enough that everyone knew everyone, at least by sight. Thomas nodded to the usual faces: Mrs. Patterson walking her ancient poodle, Jake from the bait shop heading to lunch, the new girl from the library selecting produce at the farmer's market with the care of someone for whom every dollar mattered.

He'd noticed her the day before, walking past the lighthouse path around sunset. Young, maybe seventeen or eighteen, with the kind of careful posture that suggested she was carrying more weight than should be visible. There was something familiar about her, though he was certain they'd never met. Perhaps it was simply that she had the look of someone who understood that the world contained more sorrow than most people were willing to acknowledge.

 As he paid for groceries, Mrs. Patterson approached with her usual concern for his well-being.

 ""Thomas, dear, you're looking tired. Are you sleeping enough out there all by yourself?""

 ""I'm fine, Mrs. Patterson. Just a busy few days.""

""Well, you know you're always welcome for dinner. Harold makes enough pot roast for an army."" She paused, studying his face with the intensity of someone who'd raised six children and recognized trouble when she saw it. ""You haven't been having those... visits... more frequently, have you?""

Mrs. Patterson was one of the few people in town who knew about his gift, having sought him out herself when her husband was dying two years prior. She never spoke about it directly, but she understood.

 

""A few,"" Thomas admitted. ""Nothing unusual.""

But even as he said it, he knew it wasn't entirely true. Something was unusual. Something was watching him, following him, drawn to the same moments of transition that had become his responsibility to shepherd. And whatever it was, it didn't feel benevolent.

 That evening, as the automated light began its nightly rotation, Thomas sat on the lighthouse gallery and opened his journal to a fresh page. He wrote the date, then paused, pen hovering over paper. How do you record a feeling? How do you document the sensation of being hunted by something you can't see?

 Finally, he wrote: ""Tuesday, June 15th - Tabby cat, early stages. Something else present, watching. Unknown presence growing stronger.""

 He closed the journal and looked out over the water, where the lighthouse beam swept across waves that reflected starlight like scattered diamonds. Somewhere in town, he knew, people were living their ordinary lives, unaware that their deaths might be attended by something other than the gentle shepherd they'd grown accustomed to.

 A snail made its way slowly across the gallery railing, leaving a silver trail that caught the lighthouse beam. Thomas watched it with something approaching relief. Whatever was stalking him, the snails still came after the peaceful deaths. Nature's small blessing was still intact.

For now.

**Chapter 3: Cassandra**

 The Meridian Bay Public Library became Calla's sanctuary over the next three days, a refuge that felt more like home than anywhere she'd lived since her mother's death. She arrived each morning at nine, when the librarian—who had introduced themselves simply as River—unlocked the heavy wooden doors that still bore the original brass hardware from the building's construction in 1923. The library had been built during the town's brief prosperity as a lumber port, its stone foundation and cedar shingles designed to withstand the coastal storms that could turn the Pacific into a wall of gray fury.

Mrs. Chen seemed to understand this need for refuge without requiring explanation. Each morning, she packed Calla's lunch in a brown paper bag that always contained something unexpected - a thermos of soup that tasted like comfort, a piece of fruit that was perfectly ripe, a cookie wrapped in wax paper with a fortune written in Mrs. Chen's careful handwriting: ""Today you will discover something that has been waiting for you to find it.""

River had the  quality of someone who understood that libraries were meant for more than books. They moved through the stacks with the quiet efficiency of a priest tending an altar, reshelving returns and straightening displays with an attention to detail that bordered on reverence. The building itself seemed to respond to their care - dust motes spiraling in shafts of sunlight, the old wooden floors creaking a gentle welcome to each visitor, the very air holding the accumulated wisdom of decades spent in the service of knowledge.

When River spoke, which wasn't often, their voice carried the slight rasp of someone who spent most of their time in comfortable silence. They had a way of appearing at exactly the moment when Calla needed a new book, materializing beside her chair with an armload of volumes that somehow matched her mood perfectly. Poetry when she felt restless, memoirs when she needed to remember that other people had survived impossible losses, scientific texts when she wanted to lose herself in facts that couldn't argue with her grief.

The library's collection reflected the eclectic tastes of a century's worth of librarians and donors. Maritime histories sat next to feminist manifestos, their spines worn smooth by countless hands. Children's picture books shared shelf space with graduate-level treatises on marine biology, creating a democracy of knowledge that suggested all curiosity was equally valid. The fiction section sprawled across three rooms, organized not by alphabet but by what River called ""emotional geography"" - books that belonged together because they spoke to similar hungers, similar forms of loneliness.

""You're reading about death,"" River observed on Thursday afternoon, noting the stack of books Calla had accumulated over the past few days: Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, Joan Didion, mythology texts about psychopomps and guides between worlds. The afternoon light slanted through the tall windows, casting everything in a golden haze that made the dust motes look like tiny spirits dancing in the air.

""I suppose I am."" Calla didn't look up from her notebook, where she'd been copying down passages that resonated with something deep in her chest. Her handwriting had become smaller, more careful, as if she were transcribing sacred texts that required precision. ""Is that strange?""

""Not ly. Death is one of the most popular subjects in any library—people just disguise it as biography, history, medicine, religion."" River sat down across from her, their movements careful and deliberate. The chair they chose was one of the library's originals, a solid oak piece that had been reupholstered so many times it had developed a patina of comfort that spoke to generations of readers seeking solace. ""The question is whether you're reading about death or reading about grief. They're cousins, but they don't live in the same house.""

Calla considered this, looking up from her notebook for the first time in an hour. Her eyes felt dry from reading, and she blinked several times to refocus on River's face. There was something in their expression that suggested they spoke from experience, a quality of careful attention that came from having navigated their own relationship with loss.

""What's the difference?""

""Death is universal. Grief is personal."" River traced a pattern on the table with their finger—spirals, Calla noticed, like the trails snails left behind. The table itself was scarred with decades of use, its surface marked by coffee rings and pen marks and the invisible residue of countless conversations about books that had changed people's lives. ""Death follows rules—biological, inevitable, surprisingly punctual. Grief is jazz improvisation played by someone who's never learned to read music.""

The metaphor settled into the space between them like dust finding its place in afternoon light. Calla could hear the truth in it—death as clockwork, grief as chaos pretending to have rhythm. She thought of her mother's final weeks, how Calla had been able to predict the approaching end with scientific precision while remaining completely unprepared for the aftermath, the way grief moved through her like weather she couldn't forecast.

There was something in River's tone that suggested they spoke from experience. Calla found herself studying their face, noting the way they held their mouth when discussing difficult subjects—as if words had weight and needed to be balanced carefully before being released into the world. Their hands were ink-stained, she noticed, not from pens but from the kind of old printing that came from handling books that had been printed decades ago, when ink was still wet enough to leave traces.

""Which one are you here for?"" River asked.

The question should have felt intrusive, but it didn't. Perhaps it was the library's atmosphere—the way centuries of seekers had come here with questions they couldn't ask anywhere else—or perhaps River had the gift of making personal inquiries feel like natural conversation. The building itself seemed to encourage honesty, its stone walls thick enough to hold secrets, its windows positioned to catch light without revealing too much of the interior to passersby.

Calla found herself answering honestly, the words coming out before she could second-guess them. ""Both, I think. My mother died three months ago. Suicide."" The word still felt sharp in her mouth, like swallowing glass, but it came easier here than it had anywhere else. ""I keep thinking if I understand death better, I might understand why.""

River nodded, unsurprised. They had the  stillness of someone who had heard many confessions in this place, who understood that libraries were secular cathedrals where people came to wrestle with questions that had no easy answers. ""Suicide complicates grief. Makes it feel like a song that ends mid-phrase—you keep waiting for the resolution that never comes.""

""Yes."" Calla felt something loosen in her chest, a tension she hadn't realized she was carrying. ""Exactly like that.""

They sat in comfortable silence for a while, surrounded by the library's quiet—not empty silence, but full silence, weighted with the presence of thousands of stories waiting to be discovered. The building held its breath around them, afternoon light shifting through the windows as the sun moved across the sky. Outside, she could hear the distant sound of waves against the harbor walls, a rhythm so constant it had become part of the town's heartbeat.

Through the windows, afternoon fog was beginning to roll in from the ocean, softening the edges of the visible world. Meridian Bay had a relationship with fog that bordered on the mystical—it appeared and disappeared according to its own logic, sometimes revealing views that seemed impossible, sometimes concealing landmarks that should have been obvious. The fog transformed the town into something dreamlike, a place where ordinary rules seemed negotiable.

""There's an old man who comes in every Tuesday and Friday,"" River said eventually, their voice dropping to match the library's reverent quiet. ""Harold Morrison. Retired professor. He always sits at the corner table, reads the same book.""

Calla looked toward the corner table, where the elderly man she'd noticed on her first day was indeed reading, his breathing still carrying that shallowness she'd learned to recognize. He wore the same cardigan he'd worn every day she'd seen him, a brown wool garment that had been carefully mended at the elbows. His reading glasses caught the afternoon light, creating small prisms that danced across the open pages.

""What book?"" she asked.

""Neruda's poetry. The same collection, for three years now. Never checks it out, never reads anything else."" River's voice dropped slightly, as if they were sharing something sacred. ""His wife used to read it to him. She died four years ago. Cancer.""

""He comes here to remember her.""

""Or to say goodbye."" River studied Calla's face with an intensity that made her suddenly self-conscious. Their eyes held the same quality of careful observation she'd noticed in Mrs. Chen, as if they were accustomed to seeing things that others might miss. ""You noticed something about him, didn't you? The first day you came in.""

Calla's pulse quickened. She'd learned to be careful about her observations, to keep them vague enough that people could dismiss them as intuition rather than something more specific. The pills Dr. Martinez had prescribed sat unused in her backpack for a reason—she'd discovered that the cotton-wrapped world they created was worse than the sharp clarity of knowing too much.

""He seems... tired,"" she said carefully, choosing words that could mean anything or nothing.

""Tired how?""

The question hung in the air between them like incense, heavy with implication. Calla found herself caught between the truth and the safer lie she'd been telling for years. River waited without pressure, their expression neutral but attentive, as if they understood that some answers couldn't be rushed.

Outside, the fog had thickened enough to muffle the sounds of the town, creating a cocoon of silence around the library. Even the seagulls seemed quieter, their cries distant and dreamlike. The afternoon light took on the quality that came with coastal fog, softer and more diffuse, as if the world had been wrapped in gauze.

""The way people get when they're preparing to stop,"" Calla said finally, the words coming out in a rush before she could reconsider them. ""When their bodies are getting ready to let go.""

River didn't look surprised. Instead, they nodded slowly, as if she'd confirmed something they'd already suspected. Their reaction was so calm, so accepting, that Calla wondered if she'd finally found someone who might understand what it meant to carry knowledge that no one wanted to hear.

""How long?"" River asked, their voice gentle but matter-of-fact.

""Soon. Days, maybe a week.""

""And you've always been able to sense this?""

Calla nodded, waiting for the familiar sequence: disbelief, concern, suggestions for therapy, the careful distance that people maintained when confronted with something they couldn't categorize. Instead, River leaned back in their chair and smiled—not the indulgent smile adults gave children with overactive imaginations, but the recognition smile of someone meeting a kindred spirit.

""There are more of us than you might think,"" River said quietly. ""People who see the spaces between what is and what's coming. Who feel the world's pulse a few beats ahead of everyone else."" They paused, their expression growing more thoughtful. ""My gift is different from yours—I see the spaces between what is and what's coming. Not death itself, but the moments when reality becomes... negotiable. When choices could tip either direction.""

""Us?""

""Sensitives. Oracles. Cassandras."" River's smile turned rueful, tinged with the sadness that came from understanding both the gift and the burden. ""People cursed to know things they can't change.""

The word hit Calla like a physical blow, resonating in her chest like a struck bell. Cassandra. She'd read about her in one of her mythology books just that morning—the Trojan princess blessed with prophecy but cursed never to be believed. The parallel was so obvious she wondered why she'd never made the connection before. All those years of trying to warn people, of being dismissed as traumatized or oversensitive or simply wrong, suddenly made sense in the context of an ancient curse that turned gift into burden.

""You think I'm like her?""

""I think you know things you wish you didn't know. I think you've tried to warn people and been dismissed as traumatized or oversensitive. I think you came to Meridian Bay because you're tired of being the only one in the room who can hear the orchestra tuning up.""

River's words settled into the space around them like dust motes finding their places in shafts of sunlight. For the first time since her mother's death, Calla felt the possibility that she might not be broken or crazy or suffering from elaborate grief delusions. There was a word for what she was, a tradition, a community of people who had carried similar burdens throughout history.

""Is there a way to make it stop?"" she asked, though she wasn't sure she really wanted to know the answer.

""Would you want it to?""

Calla started to say yes, then hesitated. The ability to sense approaching death was terrible, but it was also the last connection she had to her mother—the thing that had made her special in her mother's eyes, even if no one else believed it existed. Giving it up would mean losing the final thread that connected her to the person who had understood her best.

""I don't know,"" she admitted.

""Good answer."" River stood, gathering the books Calla had been reading with the careful reverence of someone who understood that knowledge was sacred, regardless of how difficult it might be to bear. ""Truth is, gifts like yours don't come with off switches. But they do come with volume controls. Understanding changes the frequency—doesn't make it go away, just makes it more bearable to live with.""

As River moved away to reshelve the books, Calla found herself looking again at Harold Morrison. He turned a page without reading it, his attention focused somewhere beyond the printed words. She could see the exact moment when his breathing shifted—not stopping, but changing rhythm, like a clock winding down. The afternoon light caught his reading glasses again, creating small rainbows that danced across the poetry he was no longer really seeing.

She pulled out her phone and did something she'd never done before: she texted the library's main number with a message for River. ""Should call Harold Morrison's family tonight. Just in case.""

River's phone buzzed in their pocket. They read the message, looked at Calla with an expression that mixed sorrow and recognition, then walked quietly to the reference desk and made a phone call. Calla couldn't hear the words, but she could see the careful concern in River's posture, the way they spoke in the tone reserved for difficult conversations that might save someone from unexpected grief.

When River returned, they sat down beside her rather than across from her, a gesture of solidarity that felt more significant than any words could have been.

""Harold's daughter lives in San Francisco. She's been meaning to visit."" River's voice was gentle, carrying the weight of someone who understood the delicate balance between hope and acceptance. ""I suggested this weekend might be a good time.""

""You believe me.""

""I believe that some people are born with their ears tuned to frequencies most others can't access. I believe that gifts like yours exist for a reason, even when that reason feels more like punishment than blessing.""

Outside, the fog had thickened, turning the world beyond the library windows into something soft and indistinct. A silver-blue cat appeared briefly on the windowsill, its diamond-bright eyes meeting Calla's for just a moment before it padded away. The elderly man continued his careful reading, unaware that his time was being measured in days rather than years, unaware that a seventeen-year-old girl across the room was carrying the weight of his approaching ending.

""There are things in this town,"" River said quietly, their voice taking on the quality of someone sharing a secret that had been kept for generations, ""that you should know about. Things that might help you understand why you're here, why your gift led you to this place.""

""What kind of things?""

River glanced around the empty library, then leaned closer. The afternoon light had shifted again, creating pools of shadow between the stacks that seemed deeper than they should have been. ""The kind that exist in the spaces between what people can see and what they're willing to believe. Meridian Bay sits on a threshold, Calla. Between the ordinary world and something else entirely—like a doorway that only opens when someone with the right key walks by.""

""Something else like what?""

""Like a place where warnings echo when they go unheard. Where the weight of unheeded prophecy gathers until it becomes something more than memory."" River paused, studying her face with the intensity of someone trying to gauge whether she was ready for a truth that would change everything. ""Are you ready to learn about the Mirror Coast?""

The words hit Calla like recognition—not because she'd heard them before, but because they felt like coming home to a place she'd never been. Outside, a snail appeared on the library window, leaving its silver trail against the glass like a signature on something important. The trail caught the afternoon light, creating patterns that looked almost like writing in a language she'd never learned but somehow understood.

""Yes,"" she said, her voice steady despite the way her heart was racing. ""I'm ready.""",1,1753117319.0,fantasywriters,0,1.0,False

I’m working on a novella about a 17-year-old girl with a strange gift...she can sense when people are near death. After her mother’s suicide, she moves to a foggy coastal town where a lighthouse keeper helps the dying… and something darker is watching from the rocks.

It’s literary, atmospheric, and a little strange - think *Kafka on the Shore* meets *The Ocean at the End of the Lane*. This is the first few chapters. Would love any reads, reactions, or thoughts!

Thanks for reading

**Chapter 1: Calla**

The bus to Meridian Bay smelled of salt and diesel, carrying seventeen-year-old Calla Thorne away from everything she'd ever known. Calla pressed her forehead against the window, watching California's coastline blur past in shades of gray that matched her mood perfectly. In her backpack, nestled between a change of clothes and her mother's suicide note, was a single cassette tape labeled ""For Difficult Mornings"" in her mother's careful handwriting.

She had listened to it exactly once, three days after the funeral. It contained the same song recorded seventeen times: ""The Way You Look Tonight,"" sung by her mother in the kitchen on some forgotten Sunday morning. Each version slightly different—sometimes humming the bridge, sometimes adding words that weren't in the original. By the seventh repetition, Calla understood that her mother had been practicing for something she would never perform.

The other passengers dozed or stared at their phones with the  exhaustion of people traveling toward uncertainty. Calla noticed the old woman three rows up had been holding her breath for longer intervals over the past hour. Not consciously—just the way people do when their bodies are rehearsing for something final. The businessman with the coffee stain on his tie kept touching his left arm in a way that suggested his heart was sending him messages he wasn't ready to receive.

Calla had learned not to mention these observations to anyone. Dr. Martinez had called it ""hypervigilance stemming from trauma,"" prescribing pills that made the world feel wrapped in cotton but never quite silenced the frequency she seemed tuned to—the one that broadcast endings before they happened.

The bus shuddered to a stop in Meridian Bay just as the sun began its descent into the Pacific. Through the scratched window, Calla could see a town that looked like it had been assembled from the spare parts of other, more decisive places. A coffee shop with hand-painted signs sat next to a hotel with half its letters missing. New construction jutted up against buildings that seemed to be slowly returning to the sea.

She shouldered her backpack and stepped onto cracked pavement that smelled of salt and something else—something like the moment before music begins, when the conductor raises his baton and the entire orchestra holds its breath.

The address on the folded paper in her pocket led her three blocks inland to a narrow house painted the color of sea glass. Mrs. Chen, her father's cousin's friend's mother-in-law, had offered her a room for the summer in exchange for ""light household duties and good company."" Calla suspected Mrs. Chen was the type of person who collected strays—broken people and injured birds and plants that everyone else had given up on.

The house smelled like jasmine tea and old wood. Mrs. Chen was exactly as Calla had imagined: tiny and efficient, with hands that moved like small birds when she spoke. She showed Calla to a room on the second floor that contained a single bed, a desk facing the window, and a bookshelf filled with novels in three different languages.

""You eat dinner at six,"" Mrs. Chen said, not asking if Calla would be hungry. ""The library stays open until nine on weekdays. The beach is good for walking when your thoughts are too loud.""

Calla unpacked her few belongings, placing the cassette tape on the windowsill where the evening light could touch it. From her window, she could see the town spreading out toward the water, and beyond that, a lighthouse standing like a white exclamation point against the darkening sky.

She walked to the library as the streetlights began to flicker on, noticing a silver-blue cat watching her from across the street. Its eyes caught the light like diamonds, and for a moment, she had the strange feeling it was evaluating her somehow. When she blinked, it had disappeared into the shadows between buildings.

The library was smaller than the ones she'd known in the city, but there was something about the way the light spilled from its windows that reminded her of safety. Inside, the silence had weight and texture, like the inside of a seashell.

The librarian was perhaps thirty, with the kind of face that suggested they had read every book in the building and had thoughtful opinions about all of them. They looked up as Calla entered, and for a moment, something passed between them—recognition, perhaps, though they had never met.

""First time in Meridian Bay?"" the librarian asked, their voice carrying the cadence of someone who already knew the answer.

""Yes."" Calla found herself moving toward the music section without conscious decision. ""I'm staying for the summer.""

""Ah."" The librarian returned to their work, but Calla sensed she was still being observed. ""The classical collection is on the third shelf. Jazz is mixed in with folk, I'm afraid. Previous librarian believed genres were artificial boundaries—said Coltrane and Chopin were having the same conversation, just in different languages."" They paused, considering something. ""Turns out she wasn't wrong. Music doesn't really care about our filing systems.""

Calla ran her fingers along the spines of CDs and vinyl records that looked like they had been loved by many hands. She selected a recording of Chopin nocturnes—not because she ly wanted to hear them, but because the case had a small crack in the plastic that reminded her of everything beautiful and broken in the world.

As she settled into a chair near the window, she noticed an elderly man at a corner table, reading the same page of a book for the third time. His breathing had the shallowness that meant his body was preparing to let go, probably within the week. He looked peaceful, which was something.

Calla put on the headphones and let Chopin fill the spaces in her head where her mother's voice used to live. Outside, the lighthouse beam swept across the water in steady intervals, and for the first time since arriving in Meridian Bay, she allowed herself to think that perhaps she had found a place where endings could be beautiful rather than tragic.

She did not yet know that someone else in town made his living shepherding those endings, or that something else entirely fed on the moments when death came as a surprise. All she knew was that the music was lovely, the library felt safe, and tomorrow she would begin the work of learning how to live in a world where her mother's voice existed only on cassette tape, singing the same song seventeen different ways.

The snail appeared on the windowsill just as the last movement ended, leaving a silver trail that caught the library's fluorescent light like a signature on something important.

 **Chapter 2: The Lighthouse Keeper**

Thomas Hale had been tending the Meridian Bay lighthouse for seven years, though he'd been shepherding the dying for much longer—since he was fourteen, when his mother passed. Most days it felt like seven lifetimes. The lighthouse itself was automated—had been since the late eighties—but the Coast Guard still required someone to maintain the equipment and file reports about weather conditions and marine traffic. What they didn't require, and what Thomas never mentioned in his reports, was his other job: shepherding the dying.

It wasn't something he'd chosen or trained for. It simply was, the way some people were naturally good with children or had perfect pitch. Animals found him when their time was near. So did people, though they rarely understood why they felt compelled to climb the winding path to the lighthouse in their final days.

Thomas kept a journal of these encounters—not out of morbidity, but because someone should remember. The entries were brief, factual: ""June 12th - Harbor seal, old male, kidney failure. Stayed with him two hours by the north rocks. Three snails appeared afterward, perfect spiral formation."" The snails were something he'd never quite understood, but they came after every peaceful death, as if nature needed to sign its name to something well done.

This Tuesday morning started like most others. Coffee at 5:47 AM, exactly three minutes before sunrise. Weather report filed by 6:15. Equipment check completed by 6:30. Then the walk around the lighthouse grounds, looking for any animals that might have sought him out during the night.

 He found the cat near the generator shed.

It was a tabby he'd seen around town—belonged to the Hendersons, if he remembered correctly. The cat looked up at him with eyes that held that  quality of resignation that meant the end was close. Not today, probably not tomorrow, but soon.

 ""Hello there,"" Thomas said softly, crouching down. The cat approached without hesitation, as they always did, and settled against his legs with a purr that sounded like distant thunder.

Thomas sat on the damp grass and let the cat arrange itself in his lap. This was the part that never got easier—the waiting. He'd learned to recognize the signs: the stillness that came over animals in their final hours, the way their breathing shifted from effort to acceptance. But this cat wasn't there yet. It had simply come to introduce itself, to establish the connection that would matter when the time came.

 As he sat there, Thomas became aware of being watched.

It was a feeling he'd grown accustomed to over the past few months, though he'd never been able to identify its source. A presence at the edge of his vision, gone whenever he turned to look directly. He'd begun to wonder if the isolation was affecting him more than he'd realized. Lighthouse keepers had gone mad before—it was practically a job requirement in the old stories.

 The cat stirred in his lap, its purr faltering for a moment. Animals were sensitive to things humans couldn't perceive. Thomas had learned to trust their instincts.

 ""You feel it too, don't you?"" he murmured, stroking the cat's head. ""Something's different lately.""

The sensation of being observed intensified, and Thomas found himself scanning the tree line that bordered the lighthouse property. Nothing moved except the branches in the morning breeze, but the feeling persisted—a weight of attention that made his skin crawl.

The cat suddenly went rigid, its claws digging into Thomas's jeans. For a moment, the world seemed to hold its breath. Even the ever-present sound of waves against the rocks below seemed muffled, distant. The lighthouse beam, in its steady rotation, seemed to slow—each sweep taking impossibly long, the light itself growing thick like honey. Thomas watched his own shadow stretch and bend in ways that defied the beam's angle, reaching toward something he couldn't see. Then, as quickly as it had come, the sensation passed. The light resumed its normal pace, shadows fell where they should, and the cat relaxed, began purring again.

Thomas looked around once more, seeing nothing unusual, but the unease remained. He'd experienced something similar three times in the past month, always in the presence of a dying animal. A wrongness in the air, as if something was watching not just him, but the act of dying itself.

He stayed with the cat until it decided to leave, which it did with the abrupt decisiveness cats were known for. It walked to the edge of the lighthouse clearing, turned back to look at him once—a promise, he knew, that it would return when the time was right—then disappeared into the underbrush.

Thomas spent the rest of the morning updating his log and checking the lighthouse lens assembly. The work was methodical, soothing, but he couldn't shake the feeling that something fundamental had shifted. The very air around the lighthouse felt charged, expectant.

At noon, he walked into town for supplies. Meridian Bay was small enough that everyone knew everyone, at least by sight. Thomas nodded to the usual faces: Mrs. Patterson walking her ancient poodle, Jake from the bait shop heading to lunch, the new girl from the library selecting produce at the farmer's market with the care of someone for whom every dollar mattered.

He'd noticed her the day before, walking past the lighthouse path around sunset. Young, maybe seventeen or eighteen, with the kind of careful posture that suggested she was carrying more weight than should be visible. There was something familiar about her, though he was certain they'd never met. Perhaps it was simply that she had the look of someone who understood that the world contained more sorrow than most people were willing to acknowledge.

 As he paid for groceries, Mrs. Patterson approached with her usual concern for his well-being.

 ""Thomas, dear, you're looking tired. Are you sleeping enough out there all by yourself?""

 ""I'm fine, Mrs. Patterson. Just a busy few days.""

""Well, you know you're always welcome for dinner. Harold makes enough pot roast for an army."" She paused, studying his face with the intensity of someone who'd raised six children and recognized trouble when she saw it. ""You haven't been having those... visits... more frequently, have you?""

Mrs. Patterson was one of the few people in town who knew about his gift, having sought him out herself when her husband was dying two years prior. She never spoke about it directly, but she understood.

 

""A few,"" Thomas admitted. ""Nothing unusual.""

But even as he said it, he knew it wasn't entirely true. Something was unusual. Something was watching him, following him, drawn to the same moments of transition that had become his responsibility to shepherd. And whatever it was, it didn't feel benevolent.

 That evening, as the automated light began its nightly rotation, Thomas sat on the lighthouse gallery and opened his journal to a fresh page. He wrote the date, then paused, pen hovering over paper. How do you record a feeling? How do you document the sensation of being hunted by something you can't see?

 Finally, he wrote: ""Tuesday, June 15th - Tabby cat, early stages. Something else present, watching. Unknown presence growing stronger.""

 He closed the journal and looked out over the water, where the lighthouse beam swept across waves that reflected starlight like scattered diamonds. Somewhere in town, he knew, people were living their ordinary lives, unaware that their deaths might be attended by something other than the gentle shepherd they'd grown accustomed to.

 A snail made its way slowly across the gallery railing, leaving a silver trail that caught the lighthouse beam. Thomas watched it with something approaching relief. Whatever was stalking him, the snails still came after the peaceful deaths. Nature's small blessing was still intact.

For now.

**Chapter 3: Cassandra**

 The Meridian Bay Public Library became Calla's sanctuary over the next three days, a refuge that felt more like home than anywhere she'd lived since her mother's death. She arrived each morning at nine, when the librarian—who had introduced themselves simply as River—unlocked the heavy wooden doors that still bore the original brass hardware from the building's construction in 1923. The library had been built during the town's brief prosperity as a lumber port, its stone foundation and cedar shingles designed to withstand the coastal storms that could turn the Pacific into a wall of gray fury.

Mrs. Chen seemed to understand this need for refuge without requiring explanation. Each morning, she packed Calla's lunch in a brown paper bag that always contained something unexpected - a thermos of soup that tasted like comfort, a piece of fruit that was perfectly ripe, a cookie wrapped in wax paper with a fortune written in Mrs. Chen's careful handwriting: ""Today you will discover something that has been waiting for you to find it.""

River had the  quality of someone who understood that libraries were meant for more than books. They moved through the stacks with the quiet efficiency of a priest tending an altar, reshelving returns and straightening displays with an attention to detail that bordered on reverence. The building itself seemed to respond to their care - dust motes spiraling in shafts of sunlight, the old wooden floors creaking a gentle welcome to each visitor, the very air holding the accumulated wisdom of decades spent in the service of knowledge.

When River spoke, which wasn't often, their voice carried the slight rasp of someone who spent most of their time in comfortable silence. They had a way of appearing at exactly the moment when Calla needed a new book, materializing beside her chair with an armload of volumes that somehow matched her mood perfectly. Poetry when she felt restless, memoirs when she needed to remember that other people had survived impossible losses, scientific texts when she wanted to lose herself in facts that couldn't argue with her grief.

The library's collection reflected the eclectic tastes of a century's worth of librarians and donors. Maritime histories sat next to feminist manifestos, their spines worn smooth by countless hands. Children's picture books shared shelf space with graduate-level treatises on marine biology, creating a democracy of knowledge that suggested all curiosity was equally valid. The fiction section sprawled across three rooms, organized not by alphabet but by what River called ""emotional geography"" - books that belonged together because they spoke to similar hungers, similar forms of loneliness.

""You're reading about death,"" River observed on Thursday afternoon, noting the stack of books Calla had accumulated over the past few days: Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, Joan Didion, mythology texts about psychopomps and guides between worlds. The afternoon light slanted through the tall windows, casting everything in a golden haze that made the dust motes look like tiny spirits dancing in the air.

""I suppose I am."" Calla didn't look up from her notebook, where she'd been copying down passages that resonated with something deep in her chest. Her handwriting had become smaller, more careful, as if she were transcribing sacred texts that required precision. ""Is that strange?""

""Not ly. Death is one of the most popular subjects in any library—people just disguise it as biography, history, medicine, religion."" River sat down across from her, their movements careful and deliberate. The chair they chose was one of the library's originals, a solid oak piece that had been reupholstered so many times it had developed a patina of comfort that spoke to generations of readers seeking solace. ""The question is whether you're reading about death or reading about grief. They're cousins, but they don't live in the same house.""

Calla considered this, looking up from her notebook for the first time in an hour. Her eyes felt dry from reading, and she blinked several times to refocus on River's face. There was something in their expression that suggested they spoke from experience, a quality of careful attention that came from having navigated their own relationship with loss.

""What's the difference?""

""Death is universal. Grief is personal."" River traced a pattern on the table with their finger—spirals, Calla noticed, like the trails snails left behind. The table itself was scarred with decades of use, its surface marked by coffee rings and pen marks and the invisible residue of countless conversations about books that had changed people's lives. ""Death follows rules—biological, inevitable, surprisingly punctual. Grief is jazz improvisation played by someone who's never learned to read music.""

The metaphor settled into the space between them like dust finding its place in afternoon light. Calla could hear the truth in it—death as clockwork, grief as chaos pretending to have rhythm. She thought of her mother's final weeks, how Calla had been able to predict the approaching end with scientific precision while remaining completely unprepared for the aftermath, the way grief moved through her like weather she couldn't forecast.

There was something in River's tone that suggested they spoke from experience. Calla found herself studying their face, noting the way they held their mouth when discussing difficult subjects—as if words had weight and needed to be balanced carefully before being released into the world. Their hands were ink-stained, she noticed, not from pens but from the kind of old printing that came from handling books that had been printed decades ago, when ink was still wet enough to leave traces.

""Which one are you here for?"" River asked.

The question should have felt intrusive, but it didn't. Perhaps it was the library's atmosphere—the way centuries of seekers had come here with questions they couldn't ask anywhere else—or perhaps River had the gift of making personal inquiries feel like natural conversation. The building itself seemed to encourage honesty, its stone walls thick enough to hold secrets, its windows positioned to catch light without revealing too much of the interior to passersby.

Calla found herself answering honestly, the words coming out before she could second-guess them. ""Both, I think. My mother died three months ago. Suicide."" The word still felt sharp in her mouth, like swallowing glass, but it came easier here than it had anywhere else. ""I keep thinking if I understand death better, I might understand why.""

River nodded, unsurprised. They had the  stillness of someone who had heard many confessions in this place, who understood that libraries were secular cathedrals where people came to wrestle with questions that had no easy answers. ""Suicide complicates grief. Makes it feel like a song that ends mid-phrase—you keep waiting for the resolution that never comes.""

""Yes."" Calla felt something loosen in her chest, a tension she hadn't realized she was carrying. ""Exactly like that.""

They sat in comfortable silence for a while, surrounded by the library's quiet—not empty silence, but full silence, weighted with the presence of thousands of stories waiting to be discovered. The building held its breath around them, afternoon light shifting through the windows as the sun moved across the sky. Outside, she could hear the distant sound of waves against the harbor walls, a rhythm so constant it had become part of the town's heartbeat.

Through the windows, afternoon fog was beginning to roll in from the ocean, softening the edges of the visible world. Meridian Bay had a relationship with fog that bordered on the mystical—it appeared and disappeared according to its own logic, sometimes revealing views that seemed impossible, sometimes concealing landmarks that should have been obvious. The fog transformed the town into something dreamlike, a place where ordinary rules seemed negotiable.

""There's an old man who comes in every Tuesday and Friday,"" River said eventually, their voice dropping to match the library's reverent quiet. ""Harold Morrison. Retired professor. He always sits at the corner table, reads the same book.""

Calla looked toward the corner table, where the elderly man she'd noticed on her first day was indeed reading, his breathing still carrying that shallowness she'd learned to recognize. He wore the same cardigan he'd worn every day she'd seen him, a brown wool garment that had been carefully mended at the elbows. His reading glasses caught the afternoon light, creating small prisms that danced across the open pages.

""What book?"" she asked.

""Neruda's poetry. The same collection, for three years now. Never checks it out, never reads anything else."" River's voice dropped slightly, as if they were sharing something sacred. ""His wife used to read it to him. She died four years ago. Cancer.""

""He comes here to remember her.""

""Or to say goodbye."" River studied Calla's face with an intensity that made her suddenly self-conscious. Their eyes held the same quality of careful observation she'd noticed in Mrs. Chen, as if they were accustomed to seeing things that others might miss. ""You noticed something about him, didn't you? The first day you came in.""

Calla's pulse quickened. She'd learned to be careful about her observations, to keep them vague enough that people could dismiss them as intuition rather than something more specific. The pills Dr. Martinez had prescribed sat unused in her backpack for a reason—she'd discovered that the cotton-wrapped world they created was worse than the sharp clarity of knowing too much.

""He seems... tired,"" she said carefully, choosing words that could mean anything or nothing.

""Tired how?""

The question hung in the air between them like incense, heavy with implication. Calla found herself caught between the truth and the safer lie she'd been telling for years. River waited without pressure, their expression neutral but attentive, as if they understood that some answers couldn't be rushed.

Outside, the fog had thickened enough to muffle the sounds of the town, creating a cocoon of silence around the library. Even the seagulls seemed quieter, their cries distant and dreamlike. The afternoon light took on the quality that came with coastal fog, softer and more diffuse, as if the world had been wrapped in gauze.

""The way people get when they're preparing to stop,"" Calla said finally, the words coming out in a rush before she could reconsider them. ""When their bodies are getting ready to let go.""

River didn't look surprised. Instead, they nodded slowly, as if she'd confirmed something they'd already suspected. Their reaction was so calm, so accepting, that Calla wondered if she'd finally found someone who might understand what it meant to carry knowledge that no one wanted to hear.

""How long?"" River asked, their voice gentle but matter-of-fact.

""Soon. Days, maybe a week.""

""And you've always been able to sense this?""

Calla nodded, waiting for the familiar sequence: disbelief, concern, suggestions for therapy, the careful distance that people maintained when confronted with something they couldn't categorize. Instead, River leaned back in their chair and smiled—not the indulgent smile adults gave children with overactive imaginations, but the recognition smile of someone meeting a kindred spirit.

""There are more of us than you might think,"" River said quietly. ""People who see the spaces between what is and what's coming. Who feel the world's pulse a few beats ahead of everyone else."" They paused, their expression growing more thoughtful. ""My gift is different from yours—I see the spaces between what is and what's coming. Not death itself, but the moments when reality becomes... negotiable. When choices could tip either direction.""

""Us?""

""Sensitives. Oracles. Cassandras."" River's smile turned rueful, tinged with the sadness that came from understanding both the gift and the burden. ""People cursed to know things they can't change.""

The word hit Calla like a physical blow, resonating in her chest like a struck bell. Cassandra. She'd read about her in one of her mythology books just that morning—the Trojan princess blessed with prophecy but cursed never to be believed. The parallel was so obvious she wondered why she'd never made the connection before. All those years of trying to warn people, of being dismissed as traumatized or oversensitive or simply wrong, suddenly made sense in the context of an ancient curse that turned gift into burden.

""You think I'm like her?""

""I think you know things you wish you didn't know. I think you've tried to warn people and been dismissed as traumatized or oversensitive. I think you came to Meridian Bay because you're tired of being the only one in the room who can hear the orchestra tuning up.""

River's words settled into the space around them like dust motes finding their places in shafts of sunlight. For the first time since her mother's death, Calla felt the possibility that she might not be broken or crazy or suffering from elaborate grief delusions. There was a word for what she was, a tradition, a community of people who had carried similar burdens throughout history.

""Is there a way to make it stop?"" she asked, though she wasn't sure she really wanted to know the answer.

""Would you want it to?""

Calla started to say yes, then hesitated. The ability to sense approaching death was terrible, but it was also the last connection she had to her mother—the thing that had made her special in her mother's eyes, even if no one else believed it existed. Giving it up would mean losing the final thread that connected her to the person who had understood her best.

""I don't know,"" she admitted.

""Good answer."" River stood, gathering the books Calla had been reading with the careful reverence of someone who understood that knowledge was sacred, regardless of how difficult it might be to bear. ""Truth is, gifts like yours don't come with off switches. But they do come with volume controls. Understanding changes the frequency—doesn't make it go away, just makes it more bearable to live with.""

As River moved away to reshelve the books, Calla found herself looking again at Harold Morrison. He turned a page without reading it, his attention focused somewhere beyond the printed words. She could see the exact moment when his breathing shifted—not stopping, but changing rhythm, like a clock winding down. The afternoon light caught his reading glasses again, creating small rainbows that danced across the poetry he was no longer really seeing.

She pulled out her phone and did something she'd never done before: she texted the library's main number with a message for River. ""Should call Harold Morrison's family tonight. Just in case.""

River's phone buzzed in their pocket. They read the message, looked at Calla with an expression that mixed sorrow and recognition, then walked quietly to the reference desk and made a phone call. Calla couldn't hear the words, but she could see the careful concern in River's posture, the way they spoke in the tone reserved for difficult conversations that might save someone from unexpected grief.

When River returned, they sat down beside her rather than across from her, a gesture of solidarity that felt more significant than any words could have been.

""Harold's daughter lives in San Francisco. She's been meaning to visit."" River's voice was gentle, carrying the weight of someone who understood the delicate balance between hope and acceptance. ""I suggested this weekend might be a good time.""

""You believe me.""

""I believe that some people are born with their ears tuned to frequencies most others can't access. I believe that gifts like yours exist for a reason, even when that reason feels more like punishment than blessing.""

Outside, the fog had thickened, turning the world beyond the library windows into something soft and indistinct. A silver-blue cat appeared briefly on the windowsill, its diamond-bright eyes meeting Calla's for just a moment before it padded away. The elderly man continued his careful reading, unaware that his time was being measured in days rather than years, unaware that a seventeen-year-old girl across the room was carrying the weight of his approaching ending.

""There are things in this town,"" River said quietly, their voice taking on the quality of someone sharing a secret that had been kept for generations, ""that you should know about. Things that might help you understand why you're here, why your gift led you to this place.""

""What kind of things?""

River glanced around the empty library, then leaned closer. The afternoon light had shifted again, creating pools of shadow between the stacks that seemed deeper than they should have been. ""The kind that exist in the spaces between what people can see and what they're willing to believe. Meridian Bay sits on a threshold, Calla. Between the ordinary world and something else entirely—like a doorway that only opens when someone with the right key walks by.""

""Something else like what?""

""Like a place where warnings echo when they go unheard. Where the weight of unheeded prophecy gathers until it becomes something more than memory."" River paused, studying her face with the intensity of someone trying to gauge whether she was ready for a truth that would change everything. ""Are you ready to learn about the Mirror Coast?""

The words hit Calla like recognition—not because she'd heard them before, but because they felt like coming home to a place she'd never been. Outside, a snail appeared on the library window, leaving its silver trail against the glass like a signature on something important. The trail caught the afternoon light, creating patterns that looked almost like writing in a language she'd never learned but somehow understood.

""Yes,"" she said, her voice steady despite the way her heart was racing. ""I'm ready.""",1,1753117284.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

I’m working on a novella about a 17-year-old girl with a strange gift...she can sense when people are near death. After her mother’s suicide, she moves to a foggy coastal town where a lighthouse keeper helps the dying… and something darker is watching from the rocks.

It’s literary, atmospheric, and a little strange - think *Kafka on the Shore* meets *The Ocean at the End of the Lane*. This is the first few chapters. Would love any reads, reactions, or thoughts!

Thanks for reading 

  
**Chapter 1: Calla**

The bus to Meridian Bay smelled of salt and diesel, carrying seventeen-year-old Calla Thorne away from everything she'd ever known. Calla pressed her forehead against the window, watching California's coastline blur past in shades of gray that matched her mood perfectly. In her backpack, nestled between a change of clothes and her mother's suicide note, was a single cassette tape labeled ""For Difficult Mornings"" in her mother's careful handwriting.

She had listened to it exactly once, three days after the funeral. It contained the same song recorded seventeen times: ""The Way You Look Tonight,"" sung by her mother in the kitchen on some forgotten Sunday morning. Each version slightly different—sometimes humming the bridge, sometimes adding words that weren't in the original. By the seventh repetition, Calla understood that her mother had been practicing for something she would never perform.

The other passengers dozed or stared at their phones with the  exhaustion of people traveling toward uncertainty. Calla noticed the old woman three rows up had been holding her breath for longer intervals over the past hour. Not consciously—just the way people do when their bodies are rehearsing for something final. The businessman with the coffee stain on his tie kept touching his left arm in a way that suggested his heart was sending him messages he wasn't ready to receive.

Calla had learned not to mention these observations to anyone. Dr. Martinez had called it ""hypervigilance stemming from trauma,"" prescribing pills that made the world feel wrapped in cotton but never quite silenced the frequency she seemed tuned to—the one that broadcast endings before they happened.

The bus shuddered to a stop in Meridian Bay just as the sun began its descent into the Pacific. Through the scratched window, Calla could see a town that looked like it had been assembled from the spare parts of other, more decisive places. A coffee shop with hand-painted signs sat next to a hotel with half its letters missing. New construction jutted up against buildings that seemed to be slowly returning to the sea.

She shouldered her backpack and stepped onto cracked pavement that smelled of salt and something else—something like the moment before music begins, when the conductor raises his baton and the entire orchestra holds its breath.

The address on the folded paper in her pocket led her three blocks inland to a narrow house painted the color of sea glass. Mrs. Chen, her father's cousin's friend's mother-in-law, had offered her a room for the summer in exchange for ""light household duties and good company."" Calla suspected Mrs. Chen was the type of person who collected strays—broken people and injured birds and plants that everyone else had given up on.

The house smelled like jasmine tea and old wood. Mrs. Chen was exactly as Calla had imagined: tiny and efficient, with hands that moved like small birds when she spoke. She showed Calla to a room on the second floor that contained a single bed, a desk facing the window, and a bookshelf filled with novels in three different languages.

""You eat dinner at six,"" Mrs. Chen said, not asking if Calla would be hungry. ""The library stays open until nine on weekdays. The beach is good for walking when your thoughts are too loud.""

Calla unpacked her few belongings, placing the cassette tape on the windowsill where the evening light could touch it. From her window, she could see the town spreading out toward the water, and beyond that, a lighthouse standing like a white exclamation point against the darkening sky.

She walked to the library as the streetlights began to flicker on, noticing a silver-blue cat watching her from across the street. Its eyes caught the light like diamonds, and for a moment, she had the strange feeling it was evaluating her somehow. When she blinked, it had disappeared into the shadows between buildings.

The library was smaller than the ones she'd known in the city, but there was something about the way the light spilled from its windows that reminded her of safety. Inside, the silence had weight and texture, like the inside of a seashell.

The librarian was perhaps thirty, with the kind of face that suggested they had read every book in the building and had thoughtful opinions about all of them. They looked up as Calla entered, and for a moment, something passed between them—recognition, perhaps, though they had never met.

""First time in Meridian Bay?"" the librarian asked, their voice carrying the cadence of someone who already knew the answer.

""Yes."" Calla found herself moving toward the music section without conscious decision. ""I'm staying for the summer.""

""Ah."" The librarian returned to their work, but Calla sensed she was still being observed. ""The classical collection is on the third shelf. Jazz is mixed in with folk, I'm afraid. Previous librarian believed genres were artificial boundaries—said Coltrane and Chopin were having the same conversation, just in different languages."" They paused, considering something. ""Turns out she wasn't wrong. Music doesn't really care about our filing systems.""

Calla ran her fingers along the spines of CDs and vinyl records that looked like they had been loved by many hands. She selected a recording of Chopin nocturnes—not because she ly wanted to hear them, but because the case had a small crack in the plastic that reminded her of everything beautiful and broken in the world.

As she settled into a chair near the window, she noticed an elderly man at a corner table, reading the same page of a book for the third time. His breathing had the shallowness that meant his body was preparing to let go, probably within the week. He looked peaceful, which was something.

Calla put on the headphones and let Chopin fill the spaces in her head where her mother's voice used to live. Outside, the lighthouse beam swept across the water in steady intervals, and for the first time since arriving in Meridian Bay, she allowed herself to think that perhaps she had found a place where endings could be beautiful rather than tragic.

She did not yet know that someone else in town made his living shepherding those endings, or that something else entirely fed on the moments when death came as a surprise. All she knew was that the music was lovely, the library felt safe, and tomorrow she would begin the work of learning how to live in a world where her mother's voice existed only on cassette tape, singing the same song seventeen different ways.

The snail appeared on the windowsill just as the last movement ended, leaving a silver trail that caught the library's fluorescent light like a signature on something important.

 **Chapter 2: The Lighthouse Keeper**

Thomas Hale had been tending the Meridian Bay lighthouse for seven years, though he'd been shepherding the dying for much longer—since he was fourteen, when his mother passed. Most days it felt like seven lifetimes. The lighthouse itself was automated—had been since the late eighties—but the Coast Guard still required someone to maintain the equipment and file reports about weather conditions and marine traffic. What they didn't require, and what Thomas never mentioned in his reports, was his other job: shepherding the dying.

It wasn't something he'd chosen or trained for. It simply was, the way some people were naturally good with children or had perfect pitch. Animals found him when their time was near. So did people, though they rarely understood why they felt compelled to climb the winding path to the lighthouse in their final days.

Thomas kept a journal of these encounters—not out of morbidity, but because someone should remember. The entries were brief, factual: ""June 12th - Harbor seal, old male, kidney failure. Stayed with him two hours by the north rocks. Three snails appeared afterward, perfect spiral formation."" The snails were something he'd never quite understood, but they came after every peaceful death, as if nature needed to sign its name to something well done.

This Tuesday morning started like most others. Coffee at 5:47 AM, exactly three minutes before sunrise. Weather report filed by 6:15. Equipment check completed by 6:30. Then the walk around the lighthouse grounds, looking for any animals that might have sought him out during the night.

 He found the cat near the generator shed.

It was a tabby he'd seen around town—belonged to the Hendersons, if he remembered correctly. The cat looked up at him with eyes that held that  quality of resignation that meant the end was close. Not today, probably not tomorrow, but soon.

 ""Hello there,"" Thomas said softly, crouching down. The cat approached without hesitation, as they always did, and settled against his legs with a purr that sounded like distant thunder.

Thomas sat on the damp grass and let the cat arrange itself in his lap. This was the part that never got easier—the waiting. He'd learned to recognize the signs: the stillness that came over animals in their final hours, the way their breathing shifted from effort to acceptance. But this cat wasn't there yet. It had simply come to introduce itself, to establish the connection that would matter when the time came.

 As he sat there, Thomas became aware of being watched.

It was a feeling he'd grown accustomed to over the past few months, though he'd never been able to identify its source. A presence at the edge of his vision, gone whenever he turned to look directly. He'd begun to wonder if the isolation was affecting him more than he'd realized. Lighthouse keepers had gone mad before—it was practically a job requirement in the old stories.

 The cat stirred in his lap, its purr faltering for a moment. Animals were sensitive to things humans couldn't perceive. Thomas had learned to trust their instincts.

 ""You feel it too, don't you?"" he murmured, stroking the cat's head. ""Something's different lately.""

The sensation of being observed intensified, and Thomas found himself scanning the tree line that bordered the lighthouse property. Nothing moved except the branches in the morning breeze, but the feeling persisted—a weight of attention that made his skin crawl.

The cat suddenly went rigid, its claws digging into Thomas's jeans. For a moment, the world seemed to hold its breath. Even the ever-present sound of waves against the rocks below seemed muffled, distant. The lighthouse beam, in its steady rotation, seemed to slow—each sweep taking impossibly long, the light itself growing thick like honey. Thomas watched his own shadow stretch and bend in ways that defied the beam's angle, reaching toward something he couldn't see. Then, as quickly as it had come, the sensation passed. The light resumed its normal pace, shadows fell where they should, and the cat relaxed, began purring again.

Thomas looked around once more, seeing nothing unusual, but the unease remained. He'd experienced something similar three times in the past month, always in the presence of a dying animal. A wrongness in the air, as if something was watching not just him, but the act of dying itself.

He stayed with the cat until it decided to leave, which it did with the abrupt decisiveness cats were known for. It walked to the edge of the lighthouse clearing, turned back to look at him once—a promise, he knew, that it would return when the time was right—then disappeared into the underbrush.

Thomas spent the rest of the morning updating his log and checking the lighthouse lens assembly. The work was methodical, soothing, but he couldn't shake the feeling that something fundamental had shifted. The very air around the lighthouse felt charged, expectant.

At noon, he walked into town for supplies. Meridian Bay was small enough that everyone knew everyone, at least by sight. Thomas nodded to the usual faces: Mrs. Patterson walking her ancient poodle, Jake from the bait shop heading to lunch, the new girl from the library selecting produce at the farmer's market with the care of someone for whom every dollar mattered.

He'd noticed her the day before, walking past the lighthouse path around sunset. Young, maybe seventeen or eighteen, with the kind of careful posture that suggested she was carrying more weight than should be visible. There was something familiar about her, though he was certain they'd never met. Perhaps it was simply that she had the look of someone who understood that the world contained more sorrow than most people were willing to acknowledge.

 As he paid for groceries, Mrs. Patterson approached with her usual concern for his well-being.

 ""Thomas, dear, you're looking tired. Are you sleeping enough out there all by yourself?""

 ""I'm fine, Mrs. Patterson. Just a busy few days.""

 ""Well, you know you're always welcome for dinner. Harold makes enough pot roast for an army."" She paused, studying his face with the intensity of someone who'd raised six children and recognized trouble when she saw it. ""You haven't been having those... visits... more frequently, have you?""

Mrs. Patterson was one of the few people in town who knew about his gift, having sought him out herself when her husband was dying two years prior. She never spoke about it directly, but she understood.

 

""A few,"" Thomas admitted. ""Nothing unusual.""

But even as he said it, he knew it wasn't entirely true. Something was unusual. Something was watching him, following him, drawn to the same moments of transition that had become his responsibility to shepherd. And whatever it was, it didn't feel benevolent.

   That evening, as the automated light began its nightly rotation, Thomas sat on the lighthouse gallery and opened his journal to a fresh page. He wrote the date, then paused, pen hovering over paper. How do you record a feeling? How do you document the sensation of being hunted by something you can't see?

   Finally, he wrote: ""Tuesday, June 15th - Tabby cat, early stages. Something else present, watching. Unknown presence growing stronger.""

 He closed the journal and looked out over the water, where the lighthouse beam swept across waves that reflected starlight like scattered diamonds. Somewhere in town, he knew, people were living their ordinary lives, unaware that their deaths might be attended by something other than the gentle shepherd they'd grown accustomed to.

 A snail made its way slowly across the gallery railing, leaving a silver trail that caught the lighthouse beam. Thomas watched it with something approaching relief. Whatever was stalking him, the snails still came after the peaceful deaths. Nature's small blessing was still intact.

For now.





**Chapter 3: Cassandra**

 The Meridian Bay Public Library became Calla's sanctuary over the next three days, a refuge that felt more like home than anywhere she'd lived since her mother's death. She arrived each morning at nine, when the librarian—who had introduced themselves simply as River—unlocked the heavy wooden doors that still bore the original brass hardware from the building's construction in 1923. The library had been built during the town's brief prosperity as a lumber port, its stone foundation and cedar shingles designed to withstand the coastal storms that could turn the Pacific into a wall of gray fury.

Mrs. Chen seemed to understand this need for refuge without requiring explanation. Each morning, she packed Calla's lunch in a brown paper bag that always contained something unexpected - a thermos of soup that tasted like comfort, a piece of fruit that was perfectly ripe, a cookie wrapped in wax paper with a fortune written in Mrs. Chen's careful handwriting: ""Today you will discover something that has been waiting for you to find it.""

River had the  quality of someone who understood that libraries were meant for more than books. They moved through the stacks with the quiet efficiency of a priest tending an altar, reshelving returns and straightening displays with an attention to detail that bordered on reverence. The building itself seemed to respond to their care - dust motes spiraling in shafts of sunlight, the old wooden floors creaking a gentle welcome to each visitor, the very air holding the accumulated wisdom of decades spent in the service of knowledge.

When River spoke, which wasn't often, their voice carried the slight rasp of someone who spent most of their time in comfortable silence. They had a way of appearing at exactly the moment when Calla needed a new book, materializing beside her chair with an armload of volumes that somehow matched her mood perfectly. Poetry when she felt restless, memoirs when she needed to remember that other people had survived impossible losses, scientific texts when she wanted to lose herself in facts that couldn't argue with her grief.

The library's collection reflected the eclectic tastes of a century's worth of librarians and donors. Maritime histories sat next to feminist manifestos, their spines worn smooth by countless hands. Children's picture books shared shelf space with graduate-level treatises on marine biology, creating a democracy of knowledge that suggested all curiosity was equally valid. The fiction section sprawled across three rooms, organized not by alphabet but by what River called ""emotional geography"" - books that belonged together because they spoke to similar hungers, similar forms of loneliness.

""You're reading about death,"" River observed on Thursday afternoon, noting the stack of books Calla had accumulated over the past few days: Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, Joan Didion, mythology texts about psychopomps and guides between worlds. The afternoon light slanted through the tall windows, casting everything in a golden haze that made the dust motes look like tiny spirits dancing in the air.

""I suppose I am."" Calla didn't look up from her notebook, where she'd been copying down passages that resonated with something deep in her chest. Her handwriting had become smaller, more careful, as if she were transcribing sacred texts that required precision. ""Is that strange?""

""Not ly. Death is one of the most popular subjects in any library—people just disguise it as biography, history, medicine, religion."" River sat down across from her, their movements careful and deliberate. The chair they chose was one of the library's originals, a solid oak piece that had been reupholstered so many times it had developed a patina of comfort that spoke to generations of readers seeking solace. ""The question is whether you're reading about death or reading about grief. They're cousins, but they don't live in the same house.""

Calla considered this, looking up from her notebook for the first time in an hour. Her eyes felt dry from reading, and she blinked several times to refocus on River's face. There was something in their expression that suggested they spoke from experience, a quality of careful attention that came from having navigated their own relationship with loss.

""What's the difference?""

""Death is universal. Grief is personal."" River traced a pattern on the table with their finger—spirals, Calla noticed, like the trails snails left behind. The table itself was scarred with decades of use, its surface marked by coffee rings and pen marks and the invisible residue of countless conversations about books that had changed people's lives. ""Death follows rules—biological, inevitable, surprisingly punctual. Grief is jazz improvisation played by someone who's never learned to read music.""

The metaphor settled into the space between them like dust finding its place in afternoon light. Calla could hear the truth in it—death as clockwork, grief as chaos pretending to have rhythm. She thought of her mother's final weeks, how Calla had been able to predict the approaching end with scientific precision while remaining completely unprepared for the aftermath, the way grief moved through her like weather she couldn't forecast.

There was something in River's tone that suggested they spoke from experience. Calla found herself studying their face, noting the way they held their mouth when discussing difficult subjects—as if words had weight and needed to be balanced carefully before being released into the world. Their hands were ink-stained, she noticed, not from pens but from the kind of old printing that came from handling books that had been printed decades ago, when ink was still wet enough to leave traces.

""Which one are you here for?"" River asked.

The question should have felt intrusive, but it didn't. Perhaps it was the library's atmosphere—the way centuries of seekers had come here with questions they couldn't ask anywhere else—or perhaps River had the gift of making personal inquiries feel like natural conversation. The building itself seemed to encourage honesty, its stone walls thick enough to hold secrets, its windows positioned to catch light without revealing too much of the interior to passersby.

Calla found herself answering honestly, the words coming out before she could second-guess them. ""Both, I think. My mother died three months ago. Suicide."" The word still felt sharp in her mouth, like swallowing glass, but it came easier here than it had anywhere else. ""I keep thinking if I understand death better, I might understand why.""

River nodded, unsurprised. They had the  stillness of someone who had heard many confessions in this place, who understood that libraries were secular cathedrals where people came to wrestle with questions that had no easy answers. ""Suicide complicates grief. Makes it feel like a song that ends mid-phrase—you keep waiting for the resolution that never comes.""

""Yes."" Calla felt something loosen in her chest, a tension she hadn't realized she was carrying. ""Exactly like that.""

They sat in comfortable silence for a while, surrounded by the library's quiet—not empty silence, but full silence, weighted with the presence of thousands of stories waiting to be discovered. The building held its breath around them, afternoon light shifting through the windows as the sun moved across the sky. Outside, she could hear the distant sound of waves against the harbor walls, a rhythm so constant it had become part of the town's heartbeat.

Through the windows, afternoon fog was beginning to roll in from the ocean, softening the edges of the visible world. Meridian Bay had a relationship with fog that bordered on the mystical—it appeared and disappeared according to its own logic, sometimes revealing views that seemed impossible, sometimes concealing landmarks that should have been obvious. The fog transformed the town into something dreamlike, a place where ordinary rules seemed negotiable.

""There's an old man who comes in every Tuesday and Friday,"" River said eventually, their voice dropping to match the library's reverent quiet. ""Harold Morrison. Retired professor. He always sits at the corner table, reads the same book.""

Calla looked toward the corner table, where the elderly man she'd noticed on her first day was indeed reading, his breathing still carrying that shallowness she'd learned to recognize. He wore the same cardigan he'd worn every day she'd seen him, a brown wool garment that had been carefully mended at the elbows. His reading glasses caught the afternoon light, creating small prisms that danced across the open pages.

""What book?"" she asked.

""Neruda's poetry. The same collection, for three years now. Never checks it out, never reads anything else."" River's voice dropped slightly, as if they were sharing something sacred. ""His wife used to read it to him. She died four years ago. Cancer.""

""He comes here to remember her.""

""Or to say goodbye."" River studied Calla's face with an intensity that made her suddenly self-conscious. Their eyes held the same quality of careful observation she'd noticed in Mrs. Chen, as if they were accustomed to seeing things that others might miss. ""You noticed something about him, didn't you? The first day you came in.""

Calla's pulse quickened. She'd learned to be careful about her observations, to keep them vague enough that people could dismiss them as intuition rather than something more specific. The pills Dr. Martinez had prescribed sat unused in her backpack for a reason—she'd discovered that the cotton-wrapped world they created was worse than the sharp clarity of knowing too much.

""He seems... tired,"" she said carefully, choosing words that could mean anything or nothing.

""Tired how?""

The question hung in the air between them like incense, heavy with implication. Calla found herself caught between the truth and the safer lie she'd been telling for years. River waited without pressure, their expression neutral but attentive, as if they understood that some answers couldn't be rushed.

Outside, the fog had thickened enough to muffle the sounds of the town, creating a cocoon of silence around the library. Even the seagulls seemed quieter, their cries distant and dreamlike. The afternoon light took on the quality that came with coastal fog, softer and more diffuse, as if the world had been wrapped in gauze.

""The way people get when they're preparing to stop,"" Calla said finally, the words coming out in a rush before she could reconsider them. ""When their bodies are getting ready to let go.""

River didn't look surprised. Instead, they nodded slowly, as if she'd confirmed something they'd already suspected. Their reaction was so calm, so accepting, that Calla wondered if she'd finally found someone who might understand what it meant to carry knowledge that no one wanted to hear.

""How long?"" River asked, their voice gentle but matter-of-fact.

""Soon. Days, maybe a week.""

""And you've always been able to sense this?""

Calla nodded, waiting for the familiar sequence: disbelief, concern, suggestions for therapy, the careful distance that people maintained when confronted with something they couldn't categorize. Instead, River leaned back in their chair and smiled—not the indulgent smile adults gave children with overactive imaginations, but the recognition smile of someone meeting a kindred spirit.

""There are more of us than you might think,"" River said quietly. ""People who see the spaces between what is and what's coming. Who feel the world's pulse a few beats ahead of everyone else."" They paused, their expression growing more thoughtful. ""My gift is different from yours—I see the spaces between what is and what's coming. Not death itself, but the moments when reality becomes... negotiable. When choices could tip either direction.""

""Us?""

""Sensitives. Oracles. Cassandras."" River's smile turned rueful, tinged with the sadness that came from understanding both the gift and the burden. ""People cursed to know things they can't change.""

The word hit Calla like a physical blow, resonating in her chest like a struck bell. Cassandra. She'd read about her in one of her mythology books just that morning—the Trojan princess blessed with prophecy but cursed never to be believed. The parallel was so obvious she wondered why she'd never made the connection before. All those years of trying to warn people, of being dismissed as traumatized or oversensitive or simply wrong, suddenly made sense in the context of an ancient curse that turned gift into burden.

""You think I'm like her?""

""I think you know things you wish you didn't know. I think you've tried to warn people and been dismissed as traumatized or oversensitive. I think you came to Meridian Bay because you're tired of being the only one in the room who can hear the orchestra tuning up.""

River's words settled into the space around them like dust motes finding their places in shafts of sunlight. For the first time since her mother's death, Calla felt the possibility that she might not be broken or crazy or suffering from elaborate grief delusions. There was a word for what she was, a tradition, a community of people who had carried similar burdens throughout history.

""Is there a way to make it stop?"" she asked, though she wasn't sure she really wanted to know the answer.

""Would you want it to?""

Calla started to say yes, then hesitated. The ability to sense approaching death was terrible, but it was also the last connection she had to her mother—the thing that had made her special in her mother's eyes, even if no one else believed it existed. Giving it up would mean losing the final thread that connected her to the person who had understood her best.

""I don't know,"" she admitted.

""Good answer."" River stood, gathering the books Calla had been reading with the careful reverence of someone who understood that knowledge was sacred, regardless of how difficult it might be to bear. ""Truth is, gifts like yours don't come with off switches. But they do come with volume controls. Understanding changes the frequency—doesn't make it go away, just makes it more bearable to live with.""

As River moved away to reshelve the books, Calla found herself looking again at Harold Morrison. He turned a page without reading it, his attention focused somewhere beyond the printed words. She could see the exact moment when his breathing shifted—not stopping, but changing rhythm, like a clock winding down. The afternoon light caught his reading glasses again, creating small rainbows that danced across the poetry he was no longer really seeing.

She pulled out her phone and did something she'd never done before: she texted the library's main number with a message for River. ""Should call Harold Morrison's family tonight. Just in case.""

River's phone buzzed in their pocket. They read the message, looked at Calla with an expression that mixed sorrow and recognition, then walked quietly to the reference desk and made a phone call. Calla couldn't hear the words, but she could see the careful concern in River's posture, the way they spoke in the tone reserved for difficult conversations that might save someone from unexpected grief.

When River returned, they sat down beside her rather than across from her, a gesture of solidarity that felt more significant than any words could have been.

""Harold's daughter lives in San Francisco. She's been meaning to visit."" River's voice was gentle, carrying the weight of someone who understood the delicate balance between hope and acceptance. ""I suggested this weekend might be a good time.""

""You believe me.""

""I believe that some people are born with their ears tuned to frequencies most others can't access. I believe that gifts like yours exist for a reason, even when that reason feels more like punishment than blessing.""

Outside, the fog had thickened, turning the world beyond the library windows into something soft and indistinct. A silver-blue cat appeared briefly on the windowsill, its diamond-bright eyes meeting Calla's for just a moment before it padded away. The elderly man continued his careful reading, unaware that his time was being measured in days rather than years, unaware that a seventeen-year-old girl across the room was carrying the weight of his approaching ending.

""There are things in this town,"" River said quietly, their voice taking on the quality of someone sharing a secret that had been kept for generations, ""that you should know about. Things that might help you understand why you're here, why your gift led you to this place.""

""What kind of things?""

River glanced around the empty library, then leaned closer. The afternoon light had shifted again, creating pools of shadow between the stacks that seemed deeper than they should have been. ""The kind that exist in the spaces between what people can see and what they're willing to believe. Meridian Bay sits on a threshold, Calla. Between the ordinary world and something else entirely—like a doorway that only opens when someone with the right key walks by.""

""Something else like what?""

""Like a place where warnings echo when they go unheard. Where the weight of unheeded prophecy gathers until it becomes something more than memory."" River paused, studying her face with the intensity of someone trying to gauge whether she was ready for a truth that would change everything. ""Are you ready to learn about the Mirror Coast?""

The words hit Calla like recognition—not because she'd heard them before, but because they felt like coming home to a place she'd never been. Outside, a snail appeared on the library window, leaving its silver trail against the glass like a signature on something important. The trail caught the afternoon light, creating patterns that looked almost like writing in a language she'd never learned but somehow understood.

""Yes,"" she said, her voice steady despite the way her heart was racing. ""I'm ready.""

1m5ocus,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddardCritics/comments/1m5ocus/psychedelics_and_the_law_my_story_long_post/,Psychedelics and “the law” + my story (long post),"Every so often, I see a comment somewhere in the LoA sphere along the lines of ""EIYPO is exactly what I experienced on my last mushroom trip!"" or ""LSD made me realize that my imagination is God!""

Psychedelics are a potent tool that can easily be misused, and while my own relationship to them has overall been healthy (they’ve been a great source of healing and inspiration), they did unfortunately influence my interest in the law.  One day about six years ago, after a strong trip, I googled ""does imagination create reality"", which landed me on the Neville Goddard subreddit.

From there, I read Mitch Horowitz's *One Simple Idea*, which runs through the history of New Thought, and then downloaded several New Thought books to my e-reader.  I knew that the arguments for the law in these books were either specious or nonexistent; that is, the authors would make grand assertions about the nature of reality supported by poor or *no* argumentation.  I also knew that the law could be used (and was being used in the NG sub) to blame people for their own misfortunes, with no acknowledgment of systemic inequality or forces beyond individual control.

Still, I was intrigued by the beliefs, just as I'd been intrigued by religion as an agnostic atheist.  But maybe that comparison is not quite correct.  I was also dazzled by the prospect of achieving my wildest dreams, maintaining perfect health until death, etc., and since some of the concepts vaguely overlapped with my psychedelic experiences, I kept reading despite having noted the baselessness and flaws.

In time, after consuming so much New Thought material, I noticed there was one thing that I couldn't shake:  Neville Goddard *implored* his audience to try his methods, which made him seem steadfastly confident in them.  He said, “If the law does not work, its knowledge will not comfort you, and if it is not true, you must discard it.""  Why not try a method that is so simple and pleasant and which I could just discard when it yields no results?

Of course, that's when the coincidences rolled in.  They were such minor coincidences and so hit-and-miss that I’m too embarrassed to list them even in this anonymous forum, but suffice it to say they were free-coffee-level blips.  I was partially sucked in.

Meanwhile, my frequent use of one strong psychedelic in particular was catapulting me into otherworldly states.  Rather than simply enjoy the awe and beauty of these experiences as I'd done in previous years, I ruminated on whether such worlds could be entered and altered at will, the way Neville described.  I didn’t believe it, but the thought kept returning:  *What if mastering small manifestations is the gateway to something larger?*

Then something tragic happened that I won't detail here, and in my newly vulnerable state, I wondered whether SATS scenes could fix the situation.  My practice of the law intensified, and I also spent more time in the NG sub scanning for success stories.  By the time some months had passed and it became clear that the tragedy was unfixable, my habits had changed.  Switching back to minor goals and free-coffee-level manifestations, I continued to immerse myself in pleasant imaginative scenes at night and felt the growing strain of cognitive dissonance during the day.

Thankfully, logic pulled me back to earth.  There was simply no correlation between my imagination and experiences.  Thinking back on my own life, I’d often achieved success while full of doubt or even while imagining scenes of failure, and all my successful impostor syndrome-riddled friends were the same.  And the ridiculous state of the NG sub signaled that no one was achieving consistent results with this so-called law.  

My rational mind regained control and untangled the chaotic web of Neville’s teachings and legacy:  The solipsism, the circular reasoning, the anecdotal cherry-picking, the exploitation of so many cognitive biases; all marks of an untenable belief structure, all things that I'd abhorred before I'd ever indulged this ""one simple idea"" of imagination-as-God.

And yet, even still, as years passed, I continued to waste time in online LoA spaces and some New Thought books here and there.  I didn’t believe in the law but continued to hold it at arm’s length in case the missing key revealed itself.  Finally, this subreddit appeared in a Google search and broke the fixation once and for all.

I'm not sure why I'm sharing my story, but hopefully it helps someone!  It seems that most people tried LoA because they desired something in particular, and I sometimes wonder whether anyone else tried it just because they were curious about New Thought beliefs or were led to it as a result of intense altered states, whether from psychedelics, an NDE, meditation, or anything else.  

I also want to urge others who may enjoy psychedelics to **keep your rationality intact and let reason be your guidepost**.  Our minds are incredibly powerful and beautiful, but no, they do not create reality.  The mysteries of life are deeper than that and cannot be summed up in one “law”, hence why advancement in human knowledge comprises slow academic processes of repeated experimentation, model-building, dialectical discourse, critical analysis, etc.  Those processes in themselves are a beautiful unfolding.

While it’s not common, when I do see references to psychedelics in LoA spaces, I wince.  I'm concerned that for some people, intense and/or transcendent experiences tend to cause hasty jumps to conclusions about the nature of reality.  But subjective experience, whether ordinary or sublime, is not a placeholder for the rigorous, methodical nature of arriving at knowledge.  That's one of the major points that believers need to realize, no matter how they arrived at this groundless belief system.",3,1753117069.0,NevilleGoddardCritics,1,1.0,False

As a coffee enthusiast, I consider my morning brew a ritual, and this pack of 128 Keurig K-Cups has certainly earned its spot in my daily routine. However, while it’s been satisfying overall, there are some noteworthy considerations.

**Smooth and Consistent Brew**

The medium roast flavor these pods deliver consistently impresses me. There's something comforting about knowing I can wake up, pop one of these K-Cups into my Keurig, and have a smooth, aromatic cup of coffee within minutes. I appreciated the distinctively rich yet balanced flavor—it doesn’t lean too bitter or overpowering. It’s one of those coffees that pairs just as well with breakfast as it does with a quiet afternoon break. Whether you're into black coffee or prefer a splash of milk and sugar like my coworker does, it caters to a wide range of palates.

[Check Folgers K Cups 025500206561 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b082394xrg/)

**Ease of Use and Convenience**

Single-serve coffee options like these Keurig-compatible pods have revolutionized how I approach busy mornings. On especially hectic days, having a quick and mess-free way to brew a fresh cup of coffee is a lifesaver. No grinding beans, no messy filters—just push a button, and you’re good to go. My partner even commented on how ideal they are for working from home because the brewing process is virtually silent, so no distractions during conference calls.

**Highlights**

- Rich, smooth medium roast flavor perfect for various preferences  
- Convenient single-serve pods designed for Keurig coffee makers  
- Versatile option suitable for morning routines or midday boosts  

**Packaging and Freshness**

I found the packaging convenient as it comes in four 32-count boxes, keeping the pods neatly organized while maintaining freshness. It’s worth mentioning that the aroma when you open the package is just heavenly—trademark Folgers. However, I did notice that the pods themselves lack additional flavor seals, making it essential to store them in a cool and dry place. For someone like my sibling, who only drinks coffee occasionally, this might mean the last few pods lose some of their initial vibrancy.

**Negatives**

- Could benefit from extra freshness seals for occasional drinkers  
- Limited to Keurig machines, reducing flexibility  
- Larger storage space required due to bulk packaging  

**Tailored to Coffee Lovers**

This product feels perfect for households or offices that value consistency and speed in their coffee routines. With 128 pods, it’s well-suited for fulfilling the caffeine needs of multiple users without frequent repurchasing. I could see it saving money in the long run for heavy coffee drinkers who previously relied on cafés. That said, if you thrive on variety, the single flavor might leave you craving something more adventurous.

**Alternative Offerings**

When stacked against other brands, such as Dunkin’ Donuts Original Blend K-Cups or Starbucks Pike Place Roast pods, Folgers K-Cups hold their own remarkably well. Where Dunkin’s offering leans sweeter and Starbucks may come across as a bit heavier, Folgers maintains a middle ground—smooth yet full-bodied. While it lacks Starbucks’ branding allure, these pods are definitely a more budget-friendly choice. However, those who prefer darker roasts might find Starbucks or even Peet’s Coffee pods a better fit for their preferences.

**Bang for the Buck**

When considering the cost-to-quality ratio, these pods offer a commendable value for regular coffee drinkers who don’t fancy overly complex flavors. Splurging on specialty blends might make sense for a special occasion, but for a workhorse product that nails the essentials, Folgers fits the bill. Its medium roast balances flavor and drinkability extremely well, making it a worthwhile investment over time.

Asking for a friend.,"A friend of mine, whom I fell out of touch with, but was very close to me, has been struggling bad recently. She just lost her job, and her rental lease is also coming to an end in two weeks. Losing her job also means that she lost health insurance benefits. Her confidence is shaken; she feels completely restless and is just not in the right frame of mind. Her parents are dependent on her, and she's just lost all interest in living. No hobbies interest her. It's even difficult to talk to her because of how broken and lonely she feels. She's lost the spark in her eyes. And she appears smaller, like physically smaller, somehow. I am an old-time friend, so she finally opened up to me. ""There's no job, and there's no house. Pretty sure it won't get worse than this. Even if I am not here tomorrow, who'd even notice?"" - her exact words. I have sponsored a couple of therapy sessions for her to help her with the situation practically. But she's one of the few people who know that I practice, and has asked me to help her. 

I have been doing protection magick for her. Come waxing phase, I will also prepare a small protection spell jar and a little protection oil in a rollerball jar for her. But, given how disturbing her situation has become, I am considering doing a road opener or a blockbuster spell for her. I am usually very confident about my spell jars, but I am not sure if a road-opener or a block-buster should be contained safely in a jar. Moreover, the place we live at, abre camino herb is impossible to find. The only few road opener oils I saw at a few online stores do not come from trustworthy sources. 

Here's a list of road opener herbs/EOs that I found - Orange, Cinnamon, Coffee, Lemongrasss, Basil, Lemon Balm, Mint, Parsley, Garlic, Rosehip, Rosemary, Frankincense. I have most of these handy. But I am not able to conjure up a spell. 

I am also unsure if a blockbuster helps her more, or road opener does. She'd need immediate job offers/prospects, and a shelter, and whatever it is that's weighing so heavily on her heart needs to go away. 

I can sense a mental block, and her overwhelmed feelings, but I am seriously drawing a blank on what exactly to do to help her situation. 

Please help me with your best road-opener and block-buster spells, and any advice on how do I protect her while doing these spells. Thank you so much! ",2,1753117009.0,Spells,1,1.0,False

I’m exploring a new side project idea – creating a simple “Buy Me a Coffee” style platform built on Solana. The goal is to let creators receive small tips or support from their audience, but with a faster, cheaper, and decentralized payment system.

Key ideas I have in mind:

No crypto knowledge required for supporters – they can pay with fiat (credit card), and it gets converted to SOL behind the scenes.

Direct payouts to creators’ wallets with negligible fees (thanks to Solana’s low fees).

Open-source and simple, with a focus on mobile-first experience.

Optional NFT-based memberships (like premium supporters get unique badges or tokens).


I’m curious:

1. Would you use something like this instead of Buy Me a Coffee or Patreon?


2. What features would be a must-have for you?


3. Should I keep it extremely simple (just tips), or add membership tiers and paywalls?

Hey Reddit. Long-time lurker, Long-time poster. I don’t know where else to put this, but I figure if anyone will believe me, it’s you weirdos.

I’m a night shift security guard at a car dealership off a dead stretch of highway outside [REDACTED] County. It’s not on Google Maps. Trust me, I’ve looked. GPS just says “No Signal” once you get about two miles in.

The place is called Morrow Motors. That’s what it says on the faded neon sign, anyway. The funny thing is, I never applied for the job. I just… got an email one day. No sender. Subject line just said “You’re Hired. Start Tonight.” I was broke and desperate. The address was close enough. I figured it was some private lot, no big deal.

First red flag? No coworkers. Not even a manager. Just a clipboard on a desk in the trailer out front with a sticky note:

“Observe. Do not intervene. Keep the gates locked. DO NOT ENTER SHOWROOM AFTER 3:33AM.”

So, obviously, I immediately wanted to enter the showroom after 3:33AM. But that came later.

⸻

Night 1:

Quiet. Too quiet. The lot is full of cars—classic Mustangs, Ferraris, a few cars that look like concept models that don’t exist. Some are covered in dust, some look freshly waxed. All have tags on the dash that say “IN TRANSIT.”

I walked the perimeter, checked the gates. Nothing weird. But around 2:40AM, the radios in the showroom started playing something. Not music. It was a recording—scratchy, like a wax cylinder.

It sounded like someone speaking backwards. Then something whispered through the lot: “Not for you…”

Thought it was the wind. I wrote it off.

⸻

Night 3:

I brought a buddy. I know, I broke protocol, but I needed someone to see it.

We sat in the trailer, drinking gas station coffee and watching the cameras. Around 3:15AM, all the showroom lights flickered on. No one had touched the switch.

One of the cars—a 1958 Plymouth Fury—rolled by itself out into the lot. I don’t mean it coasted. I mean the lights came on, it revved up, and it moved.

My friend bolted. Can’t blame him. I stayed because I needed the money. Plus, something about the whole place pulled at me. Like deja vu, but more rotten.

⸻

Night 5:

3:33AM.

Screw it. I went in.

The showroom was ice cold. My breath fogged up immediately, even though it was July.

The cars inside were breathing. I swear on my life—they pulsed. Inhale. Exhale. A low mechanical groan with each “breath.”

Then I saw it.

In the back of the showroom, behind a glass wall that wasn’t there before, was something… wrong.

It looked like a car, but it was alive. Like a muscle car built from veins and bone. Its hood rose and fell like a ribcage. The headlights tracked me like eyes. And inside the driver’s seat was a figure.

It looked exactly like me. But it was older. Decomposed. Like I’d been left in a trunk for decades.

I ran. I haven’t been back in the showroom since.

⸻

The Deliveries:

Starting night 7, flatbeds began arriving around 4AM. No drivers. Just the trucks. They back in perfectly, engines off. They unload the cars, then drive off into the woods.

One night I followed the tire tracks. They go about 50 feet… and vanish. No turn. No trail. Just dirt.

And the cars they deliver? Some have blood on the license plates. Others have plates from places that don’t exist. One had a plate that said “BABEL-00.”

⸻

Today:

I woke up with a note under my pillow.

“Test Drive Coming Soon. Keys Are In Your Pocket.”

They were. I didn’t put them there.

⸻

I’m writing this now because I think I’m being… groomed. Like the lot is choosing me. Preparing me.

Every night, the reflection in the glass looks a little less like me. Last night, my reflection smiled—but I didn’t.

If you ever see Morrow Motors, keep driving.

And whatever you do—

Never buy what’s “in transit.”",5,1753116735.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

I did a lot of journaling and meditations so below is a copy and paste from my journals during fasting.

  
Why did I do the 72 hr fast? I am very active and go to the gym 5x per week. Below are the benefits based on my research that I wanted to achieve for myself:

1. Ketosis - using body fat as fuel
2. Autophagy - cellular clean up for my body to remove dysfunctional damaged cell and pathogens
3. Increase HGH - human growth hormone. 
4. Increase level of stem cell production
5. Lower inflammation

  
What Happened and What To Expect:

Day 1 - First 24 hrs

* **What Happens to our Body:** Depleting leftover glucose and beginning an increase in ketones
* **What Happened:** Only drank water with electrolytes, green tea, ginger tea, black coffee and lemon juice. I kept myself busy by doing my normal strength training (Chest and Back Day) when I woke up at 4am, went to the sauna for 20 minutes, walk the baby dog and cleaned the house for an hour. Slept for 7:23.
* **What Motivated me to keep going:**  At 3pm or at 20 hr mark, my stomach was growling and my brain was tricking me to eat. Instead of eating, I drank more iced green tea and iced ginger tea. I also kept walking in the walking pad while watching my favorite TV show.

Day 2 - 24 to 48 hrs

* **What Happens to our Body:** Further increase in HGH, 95% of energy from Ketones and reduction in hunger
* **What Motivated me to keep going:**  I have only maxed out in the past at the 45 hr mark. I kept my eyes on the prize and really wanted to reach 72 hrs. At this point, my mind was negotiating with myself and rationalizing that I needed to stop and eat. I occupied myself by doing lots of walks in my walking pad, did meditations and read all the successful stories in this subreddit (tip: I ignored the negative posts in this subreddit). 

Day 3 - 48 to 72 hr

* **What Happens to our Body:** Immune function increase and stem cell production increase.
* **What Happened:** I only slept 6:11 because I kept dreaming that my fast was already completed at 72 hr mark when it was not. I kept dreaming of the food that I was planning to eat and woke up several times. When I woke up, I went to the gym to do Chest and Back at 4am using machines only, walk the baby dog and made an appointment to get a haircut to keep myself busy. I also started to prepare the food that I will eat after the 72 hr mark. I prepared chicken broth with egg whites and onions.
* **What Motivated me to keep going:**  At this point, I was already very happy as I reached a milestone of exceeding 48 hr when my max before was 45 hr. I was not hungry at this point and occupied myself by walking on my walking pad while working and watching TV. I also did lots of meditations (I used Calm and listened to the 30 day meditation for beginners course)

1m5o47x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m5o47x,Our cat Daisy is extremely human-avoidant and will not let anyone touch her. Full context in post:,"My boyfriend has two cats— he had the first (Daphne) for a year and then adopted another (Daisy). He said that he pet Daisy when she was a kitten, but I think when she got in her “crazy kitten terrorist” stage he got overwhelmed and didn’t give her the affection she needed. Daisy took to Daphne immediately and they’re great together to this day (they are now 4 and 5 years old.) But Daisy WILL NOT let you touch her. She is so incredibly put off by humans. She would like come around my boyfriend and sometimes sleep on his bed with Daphne before I came to live here, but would not let him touch her. She still will come out and chill around him— not sit on the couch or that close; more like just on the tower in the same room and etc— but is super skittish, if he gets up and moves she’s OUT. She’s playful and normal (and we’ve taken her to the vet; no health issues/pain) on her own (we have cat cameras lol). But she wants nothing to do with humans. She also really loves to hide and hid from me for a long long time. Apparently she would hide before I even got in the picture. 

Since I’ve been here I’ve been slowly working with her and after MONTHS and months of daily slow and mindful attention on my part she’s finally let me come close enough to give her Churus. I’ve pet her twice in the two years I’ve been here and those were absolute anomalies — 99% of the time she will hiss and run away FAST if you even put your hand near her. And I know not to put it directly straight on towards her, I’ll try to slowly put my hand by her side, or on the surface she’s sitting on, never right in her face. Even after Churu time (and now she’ll lick my fingers afterwards as well), when she’s done she’ll move away from me dramatically fast, let alone if she even senses that I want to try and give her pets. She’s also gotten to the point where if I move extremely slow and talk to her in baby voice (my bf never did that and he also has a loud voice even if he’s just talking to her nicely— which obviously cats do not like, but he doesn’t know that), she’ll sit near me at a safe distance, and sometimes even lay down like a loaf and close her eyes or slow blink, and a few times has actually shown me her belly (I almost cried lmao). But it’s just wild. I love her no matter what but I just wish she’d get to experience love and pets— one of the two times I actually pet her she purred 🥹. 

We’ve tried fluoxetine and CBD, pheromone collar, then spray, and now have two diffusers. I just don’t know what to do, and I refuse to give up on her. 

Side notes because they’ll probably be asked: - Yes she is fixed, they did that before he even adopted her I’m pretty sure (she has the clipped ear, he got her from a woman who rescues and takes care of cat colonies and such, but she was the normal baby kitten age when he got her.) 
- She has had peeing/marking behaviors since before I got here; she uses the box for pooping but has some select spots she marks, which no amount of “fixes”/things we’ve looked up to help, have helped.
- I did bring my own cat to the house when I moved in, and I know he is a stressor to her. But I REALLY do not think that is the issue—this extreme shyness and avoidance has been present LONG before he got here, and has not gotten any worse towards us humans; she just doesn’t like him. 
- She does not over groom or do anything harmful to herself
- She is very playful and loves all of her little toys when she is alone, and even plays with her big sister.

Any experience or ideas are so very appreciated 🙏

I am concerned about parking mostly, I don’t mind some crowds. I am used to national forests, but parks seem like a whole new level. We have already secured lodging. 

1) is 7:30/8 AM early enough to arrive at hoa on a Tuesday in July? We have a 4.5 hour drive, but still trying to beat the bulk of attendees. I am most worried about this stop as it is so popular (for good reason!🤩)

2) on a Tuesday evening should I be concerned about cape flattery? We have the option to go in the late afternoon or for around sunset. 

3) I have acquired an America the beautiful pass, I already have a NW forest pass, and discovery pass. We plan to get a Makah recreation pass for flattery from La Push the day of. Should I be aware of any other permits needed? Is the Makah permit something we should acquire early (limited tickets?)?

4) Marymere falls or Sol Duc falls? We only have time for one. How early should we arrive?

1m5nzx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1m5nzx6/does_the_hario_v60_drip_station_enhance_your/,Does the Hario V60 Drip Station Enhance Your Coffee Brewing Ritual?,"Hario V60 is one of those accessories I didn’t think I needed until I had it on my counter. As someone who loves brewing my morning coffee manually, the elegance and functionality of this drip station took my coffee game up a notch. The acrylic stand is not only visually impressive, with its clear design that melds flawlessly with nearly any setup, but it’s also thoughtfully made for efficiency. It's perfectly tailored for use with V60 drippers, and trust me, if you're into pour-over, this is the kind of upgrade that feels like a treat every single day.

**Design and Build Quality**  
From the moment I unboxed it, the craftsmanship of this drip station caught my eyes. The acrylic material feels durable despite its lightweight design, and the transparent construction gives it an almost futuristic look. It seamlessly integrates into any brewing corner. For someone who cherishes both form and function, the Hario V60 Drip Station balances the two beautifully. The dimensions, 5.9 x 5.4 x 8.4 inches, make it compact enough to fit even limited countertop spaces without sacrificing usability. This was particularly great for my small kitchen, where every inch counts.

**Ease of Use**  
Setting it up was a breeze because there’s no assembly required, which is blessedly straightforward for those of us who aren’t fans of overly complicated instructions. It's a single-piece design, minimizing hassle. Its exact compatibility with the V60 coffee drippers was a huge plus. I slid my dripper into place, and that’s it—it fits snugly, providing a reliable foundation for my morning brewing routine. I also noticed that it makes clean-up remarkably simple. Since it's a clear material, keeping it sparkly clean became a no-brainer; you can spot every speck that doesn't belong.

**Favorable Attributes**  
- Enhances brewing efficiency and elevates the aesthetic of coffee-making.  
- Strong compatibility with all V60 drippers, reducing any chance of a mismatch.  
- Compact, lightweight construction optimizes space without feeling flimsy.  

[Check Hario V60 price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b00a4zgcki/)  

**Performance in Brewing**  
One of the most satisfying aspects of this product is its ability to streamline the brewing process. The drip tray underneath caught all the tiny spills I tend to make, saving me additional clean-up time. It also felt sturdy during use—no wobbles or spills while pouring, which could wreck my coffee. The height of the station is perfectly balanced, allowing you to pair it with a range of mugs, carafes, or decanters. I tried it with my taller decanter one morning, and it didn’t feel cramped, nor did the flow get obstructed.

**Care Requirements**  
Although I loved everything about the station’s usability, it’s worth noting that it isn’t dishwasher compatible. Handwashing is recommended to preserve the clarity of the acrylic. I wasn’t particularly thrilled about this since it's another thing to manually clean, especially when my sink is already loaded with all my coffee tools. However, cleaning is quick—just some soap, water, and a wipe-down, and it’s good as new again.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Not dishwasher safe, which may be inconvenient for heavy users.  
- Acrylic material, despite being sturdy, is prone to minor scratches if handled carelessly. 

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this drip station to popular alternatives like the Kalita Wave Drip Station, the standout advantage here is the superior compatibility with Hario’s V60 drippers. While the Kalita setup offers similar stability and quality, it leans more towards users who enjoy broader versatility with other drippers. On the other hand, the plastic models from no-name brands may be cheaper, but they often lack the refinement and durability this product provides. For me, the Hario option wins in style and specialized usage, though I admittedly still admire Kalita’s build quality.

**Money's Worth**  
Is it costly for an accessory? Perhaps a tad. However, considering how effortlessly it elevates the coffee-making process, I’d say it earns its keep. The premium design and well-thought-out features make every penny count for serious V60 users like myself. I wouldn’t call it “essential” for those new to manual brewing, but enthusiasts who appreciate their gear will see the value immediately.

To be my littleself and experience a forever childhood 

I want to share all of the little things my partner does for me that i appreciate more than anything.because love is in the little things even the ""everyday"" things

-He calms my thoughts and soothes my soul just by him leaning into me while we sit on the couch so we're close together
-he plays with my hair something so small but its something ive always loved
-while he drives us places he places a loving reassuring hand on my leg as he does.i always feel safe in the car with him because of it.(i grew up having angry car rides with screaming parents so i always tend to feel anxious and tense in cars.i didnt even need to tell him this because he just began doing this from the first car ride with him.hes such a caring individual 
-he taps/squeezes my hand three times while holding hands to say he loves me if we're in happy silence.
-he lulls me to sleep.he does the same thing each time and hes so sweet for it. He places my head on his chest and kisses my forehead and squeezes me tight and then relaxes into me .i sleep the best i ever do when im with him
-when he wakes up in the morning before me he slinks out of bed quietly and makes coffee for us then gives me my coffee first after having cuddles.
-when i drift off to sleep he gently lowers my head off of his chest without waking me so he can get in his sleep position. I feel him doing it and its a little thing that truly solidifys just how thoughtful he is of the people he loves.
-he helped me get better with eating by feeding me soft foods to slip me into littlespace and then moved on to ""normal"" foods,now i can eat happily next to him without getting anxious around food
-he reads me nighttime stories even when we are apart.he'll call me just so i get better sleeps by hearing him read to me
-he writes me little task sheets that help me stick to a target and motivate me to be and do good
-he is patient and understanding to me and how i am,i am an emotional person but he loves me for me and holds space for me to express all of my emotions even if i cry about silly things that are non issues and he soothes me and will talk me through it

These are just some of the hundreds of things he does and i think about how truly grateful i am to have such nuturing person as my partner and my dadda all in one person.

I would love to hear about little things anyone else  loves that their partner/cg does for them that you notice and are appreciative of

1m5nysq,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1m5nysq/discover_if_nostalgia_retro_3in1_breakfast/,Discover If Nostalgia Retro 3-in-1 Breakfast Station Lives Up to the Hype!,"**Testing the Nostalgia BST3RR Retro 3-in-1 Breakfast Station**

I’ve been using the Nostalgia BST3RR Retro 3-in-1 Breakfast Station for a little over a month now, and I genuinely find it both practical and quirky. Combining a coffee maker, a griddle, and a toaster oven in one compact design, this boldly red appliance packs a punch when it comes to convenience. Although it’s perfect for small kitchens or dorm setups, it's not without its quirks—some worth embracing and others you might want to consider before buying.

**Design and Build Quality**

The vibrant retro red finish immediately caught my eye—it’s a statement piece on any counter. The 11.75"" depth and 19.25"" width make it sizable but surprisingly space-efficient for what it offers. Stainless steel accents on the dropdown door and knobs give it a durable feel, although the plastic components, like the coffee pot handle, don’t feel as premium. Its manual operation reminds me of the simplicity of older appliances, which I appreciate as someone who grew up watching my grandparents use similar devices.

**Upsides**

- Unique 3-in-1 functionality saves countertop real estate.
- Retro design adds flair to any space, especially in vintage-style kitchens.
- Non-stick griddle clearly simplifies cleaning.
- The coffee maker’s reusable filter cuts down on disposable waste.
- Toast, cook, and brew—all at the same time.  

**Using the Coffee Maker**

The 3-cup coffee maker works decently for its small scale and brews a robust cup in a few minutes. Mornings are less chaotic knowing my coffee is ready while I'm scrambling eggs. I loved the glass carafe it comes with; however, pouring can be a little messy if you're heavy-handed like me. My partner appreciated the reusable filter—a win for sustainability and fewer midweek trips to buy coffee filters!  

**Performance of the Griddle**

Cooking breakfast on the non-stick griddle has been my favorite part. There’s something satisfying about frying up pancakes next to sizzling strips of bacon while sipping my freshly brewed coffee (again, brewed by the same device). It evenly heats eggs, sausages, and hashbrowns, but I noticed bacon grease tends to linger unless cleaned soon after cooking. A glass lid lets me cover food to prevent mess but also doesn’t fit snugly, which could've locked steam in better.

**[Check Nostalgia BST3RR price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b07wfhz8rm/)**  

**Toaster Oven Functionality**

The toaster oven is hands-down versatile. While toasting bread, I’ve also experimented with heating small frozen pizzas and reheating desserts. It can hold four slices of bread comfortably or prepare individual sandwiches. I did experience uneven toasting occasionally; for example, bagels came out darker on one side compared to the other. Still, the control knobs let me manage toasting intensity with relative ease.

**Less Favorable Aspects**

- Plastic components, such as the coffee carafe handle, feel a bit cheap.
- The coffee maker's pouring spout could be improved for cleaner dispensing.
- Uneven heating in the toaster oven for thicker foods.
  
**Who’s It For?**

This multi-functional appliance seems tailor-made for minimalists, college students, or anyone living in a small apartment. For someone like me (a classic small-space dweller), the convenience of cooking an entire breakfast ensemble on one device makes mornings incredibly manageable. I also imagine it being a lifesaver in a dorm room, especially since making coffee, toast, and eggs without needing additional gadgets is a big deal.

**Competitors in the Market**

While there aren’t many direct competitors offering such a unique blend of breakfast-making tools in one package, a few toaster ovens include features like air fryers or convection heating. The main competitor I’ve encountered is a retro-inspired toaster oven paired with a separate hot plate or coffee maker, but these setups are often bulkier. What makes the Retro 3-in-1 standout is its seamless integration of features. On the flip side, other brands might excel in durability, as this product isn't necessarily built for long-term abuse.

**Smart Spending**

For what this machine offers at its price point, I’d call it an excellent value proposition. It’d be hard to find three individual appliances with solid functionality that still collectively occupy less than 20” of counter space. While it’s not perfect in every regard, the cost-to-functionality balance is definitely in its favor. As long as you aren’t expecting professional-grade performance, this is a fantastic appliance to meet everyday breakfast needs.

My husband (M30) and I (F27) are moving to Frisco from out of state and could really use some insight from locals! We’ve been touring apartments and are leaning toward the Frisco Square area — it seems a bit more walkable than other spots, which is a big plus since we’ll be sharing one car. We liked that there are restaurants, coffee shops, and things to do nearby. (No kids, if that’s relevant!)

These are the places we’re currently considering:

Berkshire Pullman (WillowBridge) – Frisco Square


Remy Apartments (Equity) – Frisco Square

MIRRA Apartments (Toll Brothers) – Frisco Square

Cadence at Frisco Station (Greystar) – near The Star

Jefferson Parkhouse (ZRS) – kind of in the middle of nowhere but not a far drive to Frisco Square, the Star, etc. 

If you’ve lived in or toured any of these, I’d love to hear your thoughts! Especially curious about how the WiFi works. I WFH full-time and noticed a few of these use “community WiFi” instead of letting you set up your own. Also curious about how you’ve felt about safety, cleanliness, building management, etc.

We live in a big city and have access to lots of activities, and we are both the kind of people who have no problem going new places and trying new things alone. It got me wondering what other people do as a special ""treat"" to get out of the house. It doesn't need to be expensive or fancy, but doesn't need to be free, either! 
Of course checking out a new restaurant/coffee shop is an easy answer, as well as going for a walk or to a park, but what are your less conventional solo activities when you have a free day? I'd also be curious what kind of setting you live in - rural, big city, suburbs?

It's meant to help expats in Stockholm connect in small, guided groups so it's easier to build genuine connections and make friends that actually last (not just quick chats at events or another “let’s grab coffee sometime” that never happens).

How it works is that each person will be matched into a small group (maximum 6) based on what they'd like to connect on. You'll be in a private Discord group, and I’ll be personally facilitating the group to help break the ice, keep things going, and make it easier to meet up offline.

I couldn't seem to see clearly from grief, and so I didn’t notice the strange child sitting at the kitchen table at first. I just groped my way to the coffee pot. Then my brain registered her, but I was so deep in my intense post-break-up anguish that it didn’t seem noteworthy.

I hope this will be the last break up of my life- I don’t think I can survive anything like this again. Not that I’ll be looking for relationships any time soon, I’m past forty anyway- closer to fifty. People think youngsters have a tempestuous romantic life and by our age group we are more mature and less impulsive- but the pain of broken love is worse at this age, as it is tainted with hopelessness and the closer march of death. The love of my life. We were so happy, everything was incredible, incredibly easy. We had made plans for aging together.

And then it was over.

“Hello” said the child.

I shrieked, and dropped the glass coffee pot. It shattered into a zillion pieces.

My sudden fear wasn’t from the child’s presence- as I mentioned, I had already noticed her sitting there, waiting for me. It was because that only now, looking at her- it- I just realised it was disfigured.

“I heard you come in” said the child.

Of course. It was blinded- two terrible black holes where eyes should be. The face was turned towards me- it would have been staring straight at me if it could see. A golden fringe of hair hung just above the bleeding dark holes in her face.

“Wha-“ I gasped.

“I’m hungry” it said, matter-of-factly. “And I don’t drink coffee.”

I took a step back, and screamed as broken glass pierced my arch.

The child frowned. “Did you step on the glass?”

I bent down and picked out the shard lodged in my arch. Blood poured freely out, splattering the twinkling glass on the floor. I reached out unsteadily and grabbed a kitchen towel to staunch the wound.

“I probably shouldn’t move until you sweep this mess up” said the child. “But I am hungry. Can you get me something to eat before that?”

“Who are you? What are you doing here?” The pain in my foot helped me focus and cleared the fog in my brain.

“I’m your child of course, silly billy. Can’t you recognize me?”

“What- but we don’t have a child-“

“Of course you did. Me. And I’ll be with you forever.” The blind child smiled at me, a terrible sharp-toothed grin. “I’m not going anywhere.” The child raised its frail arms. “Can you carry me please? I want to be close to you.”

I limped towards it, leaving a trail of blood. It looped its surprisingly heavy body on my back and neck.

“Ok, go”.

Joking aside, I love my 9Barista. It makes consistent shots of espresso, but I have two issues with it: I like light roast coffees, which the 9Barista isn't great for as the pressure isn't variable, nor is there preinfusion. The other issue is pulling back to back shots is a chore and doing this every morning before work for myself and my fiance is tiresome (using a hand grinder also contributes to this).

So with that said, I have a bunch of questions. Feel free to answer any: what is your workflow like on the 58+2? Would you say it's easier to pull back to back shots? Does it take long for the heating element to work? How much force is required to actually push the lever down? What's maintenance like? Do you have trouble brewing medium and light roast coffees? Most importantly, if you've had it for a while, is there anything you really dislike about it?
