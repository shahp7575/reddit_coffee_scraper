On Saturday I confronted him about it because he did it again and he claimed it wasn‚Äôt him but his phone doing it so I asked to see his phone and yeah he had turn it off but wouldn‚Äôt tell me why. 
I‚Äôve been with that question since but he doesn‚Äôt say anything‚Ä¶ so last night I decided to go thru his phone (for the very first time ever since we got together, it was a boundary I didn‚Äôt want to cross since is his privacy but felt like I had to choice‚Ä¶ not proud about it). Anyways, I found a text from a girl saying ‚Äúat my work they play this song and makes me think of you‚Äù so immediately it got my attention; I went thru the texts and on one of the occasions that he turned off his location; he went over to her house to buy weed. 
Today I asked him what he was doing that specific day and he said he was just at work; I told him I knew he was lying but he kept denying it. 
My issue is not only with him lying now, but also that he‚Äôs smoking again when he had already quit and that I don‚Äôt know who this girl is‚Ä¶

Disclaimer: I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of coffee taste or I have yet to have super well made espresso to appreciate it enough.

But matcha, and well curated loose leaf tea? I have such a wonderful tea collection now it brings me such joy every morning and afternoon to make myself a cup



Hojicha powder

Hojicha loose leaf (wow so yummy sweetened with a jujube date)

Jasmine pearls

Genmaicha (that nuttiness!)

Matcha (wow you can really notice the difference with higher grades!! I love sweetening it with an earl grey lavender syrup, it tastes like cereal milk!)



I‚Äôm slowly creating a list of my favorite brands so that I have a consistent collection. So far, ippodo ummon and sayaka are my fave for matcha. Hojicha I have yet to find a great brand, I‚Äôm going to try Ocha next time. My loose leaf tea I get from a shop in my local Chinatown.

This hobby / addiction is about to make me broke haha, I calculated if I drink a cup every day (at least of the matcha) it‚Äôs around $300 a quarter üòÖ but it‚Äôs sooo worth it. I love the ritual of making it and the taste.

I like games and play on Xbox and PlayStation. Space Marine 2 and Destiny and helldivers 2 are my go-to games. I enjoy shooters and action games and the occasional city builder or rts on pc. Any recommendations are welcome. 

I like cooking and so far I haven't gotten sick or made someone else sick so you can say I'm like the Gordon Ramsay of cooking something edible. I do look at recipes in terror and sometimes actually cook them. Looking for cool chatters and maybe we can play games. Or not. Who knows.

here‚Äôs some context: 
there was this person that i saw in one of my classes around two years ago, i thought they were cute and dressed really nice but never thought much about them. when i was leaving class i saw them walking out from across the campus and we locked eyes (we were around 50 feet away, they were blurry but we both slowed down when we looked so i could tell). After that I never paid them much mind until one day i was exhausted and falling asleep in class, after class i went straight to the train and got on a random seat and was staring out the window. when i looked out another train was passing and they were right next to me on the train riding next to mine - they avoided my eyes but its common courtesy not to stare at someone on the train so i looked away after a while and they‚Äôre train passed mine. 

after a while i decided it was a very film esque moment but i just decided to drop it. i start changing where i take the train for ease of transportation and safety. i realize that they take the train there too. i speak to them once there and compliment their outfit, they‚Äôre receptive and nice but the convi doesn‚Äôt go far. after a while i start to take notice of them and i think they take notice of me. we were in a large class and i wanted to make a new friend (esp one that i see so often) but im a shy nervous person so it takes a while for me to talk to people especially first. after a while i realize they didn‚Äôt pay me much mind so i try not to bother them either but they‚Äôre my type, dress nice and seem kind so ofc i develop a bit of a crush (also just needed some eye candy for class). 

after a while i notice that they‚Äôre very anal retentive. they do the same thing the same time at the same pace all of the time. get up slowly, pack their bag slowly and leave out the same door. i noticed though that when we started kind of circling around each other sometimes they would change their routine a bit to match mine- leaving out the door i did, matching my pace or a pace behind me, just putting themselves in my space in a way. but at this point i had talked to them first twice and they hadn‚Äôt so much as waved hello ‚Äî im extremely shy as well but at that point it was a pride thing. once they entered the station with another person (one of the times they broke routine) and instead of standing where they usually stand on the train they stood right behind me which admittedly freaked me out and they stayed there until they‚Äôre friend called them away by asking what they were doing. 

after a semester of this back and forth. staring at one another when the others not looking, taking the train together, just being in each others space constantly - i didn‚Äôt know their name, their age, or anything about them. 
so the next semester i leave for study abroad and decide to put them in the back of my mind, though they did pop up once or twice. when i came back i was enjoying my summer but two weeks before school i could not get them out of my head. it was driving me to the point of distraction and at that point i decided - i needed to know their name.

now‚Ä¶ HERES WHERE IT GETS WEIRD:
i thought that the knowing was better than not knowing so i just decided to go through the class roaster and do a linkedin/ ig search. i go through 3-5 times and can‚Äôt decide a name i feel matches them and can‚Äôt find a trace of them on the internet. i decided i can‚Äôt do it anymore and pick a random name from the list. the name didn‚Äôt match them but i just needed something - i didn‚Äôt expect to see this person again. school starts and i decide for a shortcut instead of using one train to get to school id transfer trains and i, as a coffee addict, leave home a little early so i can get coffee and a nice seat in my lecture hall. so i was in a place i didn‚Äôt need to be, at a time i didn‚Äôt need to be there and one day as im waiting for the train.
the train arrives and i get on and who do i see other than this person a bit across from me on the train? i freak out and my stomach starts hurting hurting so i text my friend - she tells me to talk to them talk to them and acknowledge how crazy it is that they‚Äôre there because for a solid 2-3 weeks before they were all i could think about( & im not the obsessive type, study abroad and all i had going on when i came back i had more than enough on my mind without this kid being on it too!) 

my stomach was killing so i didn‚Äôt have the guts to go to them and said if i see them again i will speak to them. i freak out about it and continue with my week. next  week on the train again - the train arrives and my stomach starts hurting, i brush it off and get on. when i get off who do i see on the platform? them. then i decide now or never and i talk to them. we walk and talk so i ask their name and guess what their name is? the random name i picked out of a list of 100-150 kids in the class. as we talk i don‚Äôt feel nervous we vibe and split ways. 

we don‚Äôt see each other for around 2 weeks from this but i know when they pass me because every time they do my stomach starts hurting - a symptom that i‚Äôve only gotten with them - if im a station away i can tell when they‚Äôre near and when they leave because id get a random stomach pain. so imagine my surprise that the next time i see them, they glance at me and walk right past. i don‚Äôt mess with any of that so the next time i see THEM i glance and walk past (even though i think they tried talking to me). since then i haven‚Äôt seen them but they‚Äôre on my mind. i‚Äôm a firm believer in if you‚Äôre thinking of someone they‚Äôre thinking of you too so they must be thinking of me. 

its so insane because it‚Äôs been half a semester and i have yet to see them but they‚Äôre always on my mind. i even wrote a letter to try to say goodbye to them and remove their energy but when i wrote about letting go so i can find another (im ready for a relationship) i felt this very odd wave of something in my body akin to jealousy or discomfort.

What are everyone‚Äôs thoughts? 

if you got this far thanks for reading! I‚Äôm deleting this soon because this just feels so personal but i wanted some other opinions on the situation. Is there something spiritual going on or am i entering psychosis? ‚ù§Ô∏èsending love‚ù§Ô∏è",1,1741844606.0,spirituality,2,1.0,False

‚Ä¢Wonderful with cooking and baking (my grandma taught me how to cook and bake)
‚Ä¢Gardening and farm experience but it's been awhile so I'll need to brush up on my skills
‚Ä¢Christian- I strive to be a Proverbs 31 woman (I used to be a practicing Wiccan but I want to exchange that for Christianity)
‚Ä¢Wants kids someday
‚Ä¢Wishes to be a stay at home wife/mom
‚Ä¢Educated in mental health so very good at reading people and what they may need (will be putting my future husband's needs above all else, especially mentally and emotionally and of course physically)
‚Ä¢Believes that men should be the ones to lead and take charge as their woman follows them
‚Ä¢Dreams of being able to pack my future man lunches to take to work with little notes in them
‚Ä¢Positive outlook on life (will be your number one supporter)

‚Ä¢Wants a stay at home wife to take care of the house and children
‚Ä¢A good sense of humor
‚Ä¢Will lift me up with support and not tear me down


Here's a little about what I look forward to:
I'll get up early while he still sleeps and get his lunch ready, pack a little note in there. If it's cold out, I'll throw his coat or jacket in the dryer for a few minutes to make sure he's nice and toasty, get his morning coffee ready in a thermos and a quick homemade breakfast like biscuits and gravy or protein pancakes with banana slices and chocolate chips so he can feel full until lunch, sigh it's the dream. Not to mention when he gets home from work, having dinner ready like my grandma's recipe for homemade chicken and dumplings or my secret recipe for pot roast with blackberry cobbler and vanilla ice cream for dessert. Having him settle on the couch and relax while I clean up the kitchen and load the dishwasher, coaxing him to get in the shower so he can clean off all the grime from the day and throwing the towel in the dryer so it's nice and warm for when he gets out.

I am not perfect by any means and I don't expect you to be either. What I do expect is good communication skills and for you to be honest about your intentions and feelings. I have some red flags, ask about them after we've introduced ourselves to each other. I'd rather not air my dirty laundry out in public. Ideally I'd love to live in the country or a small town and have a little homestead. I dream about that kind of stuff like feeding the chickens and gathering their eggs and making homemade meals and desserts from scratch with grandma's recipe. I'm also happy to live in the city as long as I can maintain my dream of having a cozy home and packing my man's lunch. Please don't waste my time.

1ja4xc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Informal_Effect/comments/1ja4xc3/gabriels_monologue_the_empty_stage/,Gabriel‚Äôs Monologue: The Empty Stage,"**Background: this is an excerpt from Monologues from the Black Book, a society set in the future.**


*The curtains in Gabriel's city flat, near the US Capitol, were perpetually drawn, shielding him from the city's harsh light. His high-profile government role had ended, leaving him adrift and without direction. Seeking solace in the muted gloom, a mirror to his aimless inner world, he retreated to the shadows, avoiding social gatherings and human contact, preferring the company of his own dark and unsettling thoughts.*


‚ÄúThe rain outside is a constant, rhythmic drumming, like the beat of a heart that's slowly giving up. Just like mine, I suppose. Empty. That's the word that keeps echoing in my head. Empty. This room, this city, this life... it all feels hollow. Like a stage set after the actors have left, the lights dimming, the applause long faded.


I keep replaying the moments in my mind, the ones where I could have... should have... said something, done something. But the words always caught in my throat, choked by fear and self-doubt. And now, she's gone. To him. To Victor. And who can blame her? He offers her something I never could. Power. Protection. A twisted kind of love, maybe, but love nonetheless.


*Empty takeout containers littered the small kitchen, a testament to his neglect of self-care. He ate only when hunger became unbearable, and even then, it was a mechanical act, devoid of pleasure. He would pace his room for hours, a restless energy fueled by anxiety and despair. The rhythmic sound of his footsteps echoed in the silence, a lonely counterpoint to his inner monologue.*


I'm left with the echoes of my own failures. The empty hookups, the desperate attempts to fill the void, they all seem so pointless now. Like trying to patch a dam with tissue paper. I thought I was being strong, walking away, giving her space. But all I did was push her further into his arms.


They say absence makes the heart grow fonder. But for me, it just made the emptiness grow larger, a gaping maw that threatens to swallow me whole. I see her face in every crowd, hear her voice in every whisper of the wind. A ghost haunting my every waking moment.


*Stacks of unopened mail lay scattered on the coffee table, a symbol of his detachment from the outside world. He had lost interest in the mundane details of life and would spend hours scrolling through social media, a hollow attempt to connect with others, but the faces on the screen only amplified his loneliness. Alternatively, he would stare at a blank computer screen, the cursor blinking, mocking his inability to create.*


I know I should move on. Find someone else. Build a life. But how can I, when my heart is still tethered to her, a broken kite caught in the branches of a dead tree? I'm trapped in this cycle of longing and regret, a self-fulfilling prophecy of my own making.
Maybe I'm just weak. Maybe I'm just not meant for love. Maybe I'm destined to wander this desolate landscape, a ghost among the living, forever haunted by the memory of what could have been.


*A single, melancholy song played on repeat, its mournful melody echoing through the empty rooms. It was a soundtrack to his despair, a constant reminder of his pain. Even in his deepest despair, he would sometimes clutch a pen and paper, attempting to translate his pain into words. The act of writing was a desperate attempt to find meaning in his suffering.*


But even in this darkness, the deepest I've ever known, a flicker of hope remains. A tiny ember glowing in the ashes of my despair. I'll find a way to heal. I'll learn to live with the emptiness. I'll find a purpose beyond this aching void. I have felt just the same in my life. I truly believe there comes a point, perhaps briefly, where there is no shame in begging. To admit with the core of your being that you need someone, like a levy breaking. Even if it comes to little, the water flows, instead of being stagnant. I'll find a purpose beyond this aching void.


I'll write. I'll pour my pain into words, shape my sorrow into art. And maybe I'll find a way to turn this darkness into something beautiful. Or at least something that makes sense.‚Äù",1,1741843742.0,Informal_Effect,0,1.0,False

Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.

Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!

Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.

Saves us millions.

Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.

But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.

But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.

The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.

What's the difference?

You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.

So you'll just work us to death?

We'll sure try.

Wow! That blew my mind!

""What's the difference?""

How can you say that?

One job forever?

That's an insane choice to have to make.

I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.

But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?

Why would you question anything? We're bees.

What do you think, buzzy-boy?

Are you bee enough?

I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.

Hey, Honex!

Dad, you surprised me.

You decide what you're interested in?

Well, there's a lot of choices.

But you only get one.

Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?

Son, let me tell you about stirring.

You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.

You get yourself into a rhythm.

It's a beautiful thing.

You know, Dad, the more I think about it,

maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.

You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?

That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.

Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!

Barry, you are so funny sometimes.

I'm not trying to be funny.

You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

You're gonna be a stirrer?

No one's listening to me!

Wait till you see the sticks I have.

I could say anything right now.

I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

Let's open some honey and celebrate!

Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!

I'm so proud.

We're starting work today!

Today's the day.

Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.

Yeah, right.

Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

Is it still available?

Hang on. Two left!

One of them's yours! Congratulations!

Step to the side.

What'd you get?

Picking crud out. Stellar!

Wow!

Couple of newbies?

Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

Make your choice.

You want to go first?

No, you go.

Oh, my. What's available?

Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.

Any chance of getting the Krelman?

Sure, you're on.

I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

Wax monkey's always open.

The Krelman opened up again.

What happened?

A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.

Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!

Oh, this is so hard!

Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.

Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?

Barry!

All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...

What happened to you?

Where are you?

I'm going out.

Out? Out where?

Out there.

Oh, no!

I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.

You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

Another call coming in.

If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.

Hey, guys.

Look at that.

Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

Sign here, here. Just initial that.

Thank you.

OK.

You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.

So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.

Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.

Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!

That's awful.

And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!

 All right, launch positions!

Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

Black and yellow!

Hello!

You ready for this, hot shot?

Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

Wind, check.

Antennae, check.

Nectar pack, check.

Wings, check.

Stinger, check.

Scared out of my shorts, check.

OK, ladies,

let's move it out!

Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!

All of you, drain those flowers!

Wow! I'm out!

I can't believe I'm out!

So blue.

I feel so fast and free!

Box kite!

Wow!

Flowers!

This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.

Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

Roses!

30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

Stand to the side, kid.

It's got a bit of a kick.

That is one nectar collector!

Ever see pollination up close?

No, sir.

I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.

See that? It's a little bit of magic.

That's amazing. Why do we do that?

That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

Cool.

I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?

Copy that visual.

Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.

Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?

Affirmative.

That was on the line!

This is the coolest. What is it?

I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

It smells good.

Not like a flower, but I like it.

Yeah, fuzzy.

Chemical-y.

Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.

My sweet lord of bees!

Candy-brain, get off there!

Problem!

Guys!

This could be bad.

Affirmative.

Very close.

Gonna hurt.

Mama's little boy.

You are way out of position, rookie!

Coming in at you like a missile!

Help me!

I don't think these are flowers.

Should we tell him?

I think he knows.

What is this?!

Match point!

You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!

Yowser!

Gross.

There's a bee in the car!

Do something!

I'm driving!

Hi, bee.

He's back here!

He's going to sting me!

Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!

He blinked!

Spray him, Granny!

What are you doing?!

Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.

I gotta get home.

Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.

Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

Ken, could you close the window please?

Ken, could you close the window please?

Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.

Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

What was that?

Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!

That is diabolical.

It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

What's number one? Star Wars?

Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.

No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.

When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.

I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.

Wait! Stop! Bee!

Stand back. These are winter boots.

Wait!

Don't kill him!

You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!

Why does his life have less value than yours?

Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?

I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.

My brochure!

There you go, little guy.

I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.

 Put that on your resume brochure.

My whole face could puff up.

Make it one of your special skills.

Knocking someone out is also a special skill.

Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?

Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

You could put carob chips on there.

Bye.

Supposed to be less calories.

Bye.

I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.

All right, here it goes.

Nah.

What would I say?

I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.

I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.

Oh, I can't do it. Come on!

No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.

How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good.

Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

Hi!

I'm sorry. You're talking.

Yes, I know.

You're talking!

I'm so sorry.

No, it's OK. It's fine.

I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed.

Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.

This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!

I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me.

And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.

That was a little weird. I'm talking with a bee.

Yeah.

I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!

I just want to say I'm grateful.

I'll leave now.

Wait! How did you learn to do that?

What?

The talking thing.

Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.

That's very funny.

Yeah.

Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

Anyway... Can I... get you something?

Like what?

I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?

I don't want to put you out.

It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

It's just coffee.

I hate to impose.

Don't be ridiculous!

Actually, I would love a cup.

Hey, you want rum cake?

I shouldn't.

Have some.

No, I can't.

Come on!

I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

Where?

These stripes don't help.

You look great!

I don't know if you know anything about fashion.

Are you all right?

No.

He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.

He finally gets there.

He runs up the steps into the church.

The wedding is on.

And he says, ""Watermelon?

I thought you said Guatemalan.

Why would I marry a watermelon?""

Is that a bee joke?

That's the kind of stuff we do.

Yeah, different.

That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this?

He's been talking to humans.

What? Talking to humans?!

He has a human girlfriend. And they make out!

Make out? Barry!

We do not.

You wish you could.

Whose side are you on?

The bees!

I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.

Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?

I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!

Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked

your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop.

I remember that.

What right do they have to our honey?

We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!

Even if it's true, what can one bee do?

Sting them where it really hurts.

In the face! The eye!

That would hurt.

No.

Up the nose? That's a killer.

There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.

Hive at Five, The Hive's only full-hour action news source.

No more bee beards!

With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Chung.

Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.

And I'm Jeanette Ohung.

A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally!

Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, classy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.

Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from The Hive. I can't do this""?

Bees have never been afraid to change the world.

What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.

We were thinking of stickball or candy stores.

How old are you?

The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century.

You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.

It's a common name. Next week...

He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots...

Next week...

Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em.

Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live.

Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish.

In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness!

It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

Honey, her backhand's a joke!

I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

Quiet, please.

Actual work going on here.

Is that that same bee?

Yes, it is!

I'm helping him sue the human race.

Hello.

Hello, bee.

This is Ken.

Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.

Why does he talk again?

Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working.

But it's our yogurt night!

Bye-bye.

Why is yogurt night so difficult?!

You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!

Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.

Frosting...

How many sugars?

Just one. I try not to use the competition.

So why are you helping me?

Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.

Those are great, if you're three.

And artificial flowers.

Oh, those just get me psychotic!

Yeah, me too.

Bent stingers, pointless pollination.

Bees must hate those fake things!

Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.

Maybe this could make up for it a little bit.

This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.

I guess.

You sure you want to go through with it?

Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty!

It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.

What have we gotten into here, Barry?

It's pretty big, isn't it?

I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day.

You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?

Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.

What's the matter?

I don't know, I just got a chill.

Well, if it isn't the bee team.

You boys work on this?

All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.

All right. Case number 4475,

Superior Court of New York,

Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session.

Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively?

A privilege.

Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world?

I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.

Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.

If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean.

I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches!

Talking bee!

How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?

They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids!

Mr. Benson?

Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives.

Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys!

I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are!

I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!

Call your first witness.

So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.

I suppose so.

I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!

Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.

Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.

I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?

No.

I couldn't hear you.

No.

No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.

You mean like this?

Bears kill bees!

How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away.

So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. Where have I heard it before?

I was with a band called The Police.

But you've never been a police officer, have you?

No, I haven't.

No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.

Oh, please.

Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

That's not his real name?! You idiots!

Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.

Thank you. Thank you.

I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.

I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?

Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!

This isn't a goodfella.

This is a badfella!

Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!

Order in this court!

You're all thinking it!

Order! Order, I say!

Say it!

Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side.

Are we doing everything right, legally?

I'm a florist.

Right. Well, here's to a great team.

To a great team!

Well, hello.

Ken!

Hello.

I didn't think you were coming.

No, I was just late I tried to call, but... the battery.

I didn't want all this to go to waste,

so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.

Oh, that was lucky.

There's a little left. I could heat it up.

Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby.

That's where I usually sit. Right... there.

Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill.

You think I don't see what you're doing?

I know how hard it is to find the right job. We have that in common.

Do we?

Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.

That's just what I was thinking about doing.

Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

I'm going to drain the old stinger.

Yeah, you do that.

Look at that.

You know, I've just about had it with your little Mind Games.

What's that?

Italian Vogue.

Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

A lot of ads.

Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?

Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here!

I love the smell of flowers.

How do you like the smell of flames?!

Not as much.

Water bug! Not taking sides!

Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat!

This is pathetic!

I've got issues!

Well, well, well, a royal flush!

You're bluffing.

Am I?

Surf's up, dude!

Poo water!

That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings!

Kenneth! What are you doing?!

You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it!

We need to talk! He's just a little bee!

And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time!

Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life?

 No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them!

Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...

My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster!

Goodbye, Ken.

And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man!

I'm sorry about all that.

I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it!

I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it.

Oh, well.

Are you OK for the trial?

I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.

We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers...

Yeah.

Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over.

Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees.

You got the tweezers?

Are you allergic?

Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know.

What exactly is your relationship to that woman?

We're friends.

Good friends?

Yes.

How good? Do you live together?

Wait a minute... Are you her little... bedbug?

I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children?

Yeah, but...

So those aren't your real parents!

Oh, Barry...

Yes, they are!

Hold me back!

You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson?

He's denouncing bees!

Don't y'all date your cousins?

Objection!

I'm going to pincushion this guy!

Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit!

Order! Order!

The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way!

Adam, stay with me.

I can't feel my legs.

What Angel of Mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks?

I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please!

The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed Turn Against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery.

Hey, buddy.

Hey.

Is there much pain?

Yeah.

I... I blew the whole case, didn't I?

It doesn't matter. What matters is

you're alive. You could have died.

I'd be better off dead. Look at me.

They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it.

What was it like to sting someone?

I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then...and then ecstasy!

All right.

You think it was all a trap?

Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this.

What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world.

What will the humans do to us if they win?

I don't know.

I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad.

Adam, they check in, but they don't check out!

Oh, my.

Could you get a nurse to close that window?

Why?

The smoke.

Bees don't smoke.

Right. Bees don't smoke.

Bees don't smoke!

But some bees are smoking.

That's it! That's our case!

It is? It's not over?

Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.

Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can.

And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.

Mr. Flayman.

Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

Where is the rest of your team?

Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time.

I actually heard a funny story about...

Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?

They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.

I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case!

Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion.

But you can't! We have a terrific case.

Where is your proof?

Where is the evidence?

Show me the smoking gun!

Hold it, Your Honor!

You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun.

What is that?

It's a bee smoker!

What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.

Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, ""Smoking or non?"" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps?

Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?

What are we gonna do?

He's playing the species card.

Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!

Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees!

The court finds in favor of the bees!

Vanessa, we won!

I knew you could do it! High-five!

Sorry.

I'm OK! You know what this means?

All the honey will finally belong to the bees.

Now we won't have to work so hard all the time.

This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.

You'll regret this.

Barry, how much honey is out there?

All right. One at a time.

Barry, who are you wearing?

My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.

What if Montgomery's right?

What do you mean?

We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.

Congratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?

First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.

Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop.

We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine.

We're all aware of what they do in the woods.

Wait for my signal. Take him out.

He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine.

And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...

But it's just a prance-about stage name!

...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.

Can't breathe.

Bring it in, boys!

Hold it right there! Good.

Tap it.

Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups and there's gallons more coming!

I think we need to shut down!

Shut down? We've never shut down.

Shut down honey production!

Stop making honey!

Turn your key, sir!

What do we do now?

Cannonball!

We're shutting honey production!

Mission abort.

Aborting pollination and nectar detail.

Returning to base.

Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there.

Oh, yeah?

What's going on? Where is everybody?

Are they out celebrating?

They're home.

They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in.

I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.

At least we got our honey back.

Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't?

It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it.

This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now...

Now I can't.

I don't understand why they're not happy.

I thought their lives would be better!

They're doing nothing. It's amazing.

Honey really changes people.

You don't have any idea what's going on, do you?

What did you want to show me?

This.

What happened here?

That is not the half of it.

Oh, no. Oh, my.

They're all wilting.

Doesn't look very good, does it?

No.

And whose fault do you think that is?

You know, I'm gonna guess bees.

Bees?

Specifically, me.

I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.

It's not just flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.

Why? Come on, it's my turn.

How is the plane flying?

I don't know.

Hello?

Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there?

The Pollen Jocks!

They do get behind a fellow.

Black and yellow.

Hello.

All right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop.

Where? I can't see anything. Can you?

No, nothing. It's all cloudy.

Come on. You got to think bee, Barry.

Thinking bee.

Thinking bee.

Thinking bee!

Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something.

What?

I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.

Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.

Bring the nose down.

Thinking bee!

Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

What in the world is on the tarmac?

Get some lights on that!

Thinking bee!

Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

Vanessa, aim for the flower.

OK.

Cut the engines. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys?

Affirmative!

Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.

Land on that flower!

Ready? Full reverse!

Spin it around!

Not that flower! The other one!

Which one?

That flower.

I'm aiming at the flower!

That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.

I mean the giant pulsating flower made of millions of bees!

Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.

Rotate around it.

This is insane, Barry!

This's the only way I know how to fly.

Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern?

Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse!

Just drop it. Be a part of it.

Aim for the center!

Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!

Come on, already.

Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly!

Yes. No high-five!

Right.

Barry, it worked!

Did you see the giant flower?

What giant flower? Where? Of course

I saw the flower! That was genius!

Thank you.

But we're not done yet.

Listen, everyone!

This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth.

That means this is our Last Chance. We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this.

If we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say?

Are we going to be bees, or just Museum of Natural History keychains?

We're bees!

Keychain!

Then follow me! Except Keychain.

Hold on, Barry. Here. You've earned this.

Yeah!

I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.

Oh, yeah.

That's our Barry.

Mom! The bees are back!

If anybody needs to make a call, now's the time. I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight!

Here's your change. Have a great afternoon! Can I help who's next?

Would you like some honey with that?

It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.

Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.  And I don't see a nickel!

Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat!

I had no idea.

Barry, I'm sorry.

Have you got a moment?

Would you excuse me?

My mosquito associate will help you.

Sorry I'm late.

He's a lawyer too?

I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase.

Have a great afternoon!

Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get them anywhere.

No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me.

You're a lifesaver, Barry. Can I help who's next?

All right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly.

Thank you, Barry!

That bee is living my life!

Let it go, Kenny.

When will this nightmare end?!

Let it all go.

Beautiful day to fly.

Sure is.

Between you and me,

I was dying to get out of that office.

You have got to start thinking bee, my friend.

Thinking bee!

Me?

Hold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Can we stop here?

I'm not making a major life decision during a production number!

All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys.

I had virtually no rehearsal for that.""

The main girl was pretty popular in school and she has a major crush on a jock. One who had never really paid her any attention. Her mother worked for a rich guy. He wanted the mother to come over for the summer to help around the house and what not. 
So, they go. And while there, The daughter meets the boss‚Äô daughter. They hit it off and eventually sleep together I think during a movie night. There‚Äôs no major detail, I think it was more of a YA book. 
At the end of the summer, the main girl goes back to her hometown and goes back to school. When she arrives on her first day, her crush approaches her and they chat for a while but mid conversation, the boss‚Äô daughter walks into the school as a transfer student. 
Things get complicated between them, but the main girl got with her crush, but she realizes she only wants the boss‚Äô daughter. And they get together. Happily ever after.

Exactly one week ago (03/05) I had a fistulotomy.  Honestly recovery has been very uneventful for the most part. Some burning when going to the bathroom but overall nothing crazy. 

I have been really good about not sitting and have gone for a few light walks as encouraged by my post op instructions. 

Today (03/12) on my walk I stopped by a coffee shop for a drink and sat down for a brief moment as I do not have any pain when sitting - and being 1 week out thought it would be ok. 

Ended up having significant bleeding and decided to do to the ER to be safe giving the amount of blood. 

The CRS physicians came in and looked and said I probably dislodged a blood clot / wound may have reopened some. 

I did ask them if I caused any damage and they said that this sort of things happens with this surgery and not to stress too much. But to keep following the post-op instructions. . 

I have a post-op appointment already scheduled with my CRS on 03/17 anyways so won‚Äôt be long for my to see him. 

But has this happened to anybody else or have they had a similar experience? 

I‚Äôm just worried I set myself back after what was so far an easy healing process.

1ja4byr,https://www.reddit.com/r/finedining/comments/1ja4byr/quintonil_cdmx/,"Quintonil (**, CDMX)","Worth all the hype and then some. Not a single bad dish and the standouts are some of the best bites I have had in a while, possibly ever. In order:

1. Chileatole - Warm, salty, with just a little heat. 8/10
2. Aged kampachi taco & avocado tostada - Both good bites and I feel obliged to mention how intricate the garnishes are. 7/5/10
3. Mussel tartlet - Not a big fan of mussels but I liked their ""mole de mar."" 7/10
4. Butternut squash and tomato salad - Probably the weakest dish of the night, tomatoes were good but there were too few of them. 7/10
5. Margarita scallop - Starting to heat up, this was definitely one of my favorites. Perfect balance of sweetness, sourness, and acidity. 9.5/10
6. King Crab - Not much to say about the crab so I'll use this opportunity to say that despite many dishes featuring edible flowers, I never once found the floral flavors to be overpowering (which they usually are). 8/10
7. Tune belly sope - Delicious fatty tuna belly and also apparently a couple kinds of insects in here. They're all ground up and you would never know they're there if they didn't tell you, so no one should be scared off by their presence. 9/10
8. Cactus paddle sorbet - Unbelievably cruel that the best dish on the menu is a palate cleanser that you only get a few bites of. I would buy gallons of this stuff if I could. 10/10
9. Duck tamal - Unreal dish, had to restrain myself from picking up the banana leaf and licking all the corn cream because that's how good it is. 10/10
10. Mole, rib eye & friends - A great dish but very difficult for anything to follow that tamal. The mole and chorizo are great, the rest is good but nothing special. 7.5/10
11. Coconut sorbet - I was extremely skeptical of a caviar-topped sorbet, but it actually works super well. The buttery, creamy caviar combining with the sweet coconut is a great sensation. 9/10
12. Mexican cornbread - Bascially everything in this dish is made out of corn. Which works for me since I love corn, but I don't think this dish will be winning any awards for inventiveness or flavor profile. 8/10
13. Mignardises - Okay I guess these were technically the weakest part of the meal, but to be fair, it's quite rare to find exceptional mignardises/petit fours. The fruit tart (papaya, I think?) was too sweet, and the chocolates were fine, a little better than what you would find in a See's candy box. 5/10

Dining space was cozy and intimate (sat in the front area nearest to the door) but nothing exceptional. Service was friendly and attentive, they tried their best to explain every dish, although there was a little bit of a language barrier. Price was 4,950 pesos (a little under 250 USD) before drinks/tax/tip, which is an incredible value considering the only menus I have had that compete with this are all above $400. Even after cocktails, coffee, tax, and generous gratuity, it worked out to be \~$390/pp. Oh and speaking of cocktails, shout out to their house cocktail, definitely worth the $28 asking price. So yeah, 100% must visit if you ever find yourself in CDMX, and squarely in the running for my favorite dining experience in North America alongside Atomix and Singlethread.

However there have been a few instances where things seem a little off - for context before explaining any of these, my girlfriend did go through a lot of failed talking stages + dates before meeting me and consistently tells me that she is serious about me and truly believes that she met the one. Anyways, the first event that happened was she told me she was going to a coffee shop to meet with a guy from church about making music (she is passionate about making songs/singing) and they hungout for awhile and nothing ever came of it until 2 months later when I asked her how that song was going and she told me that the guy actually was calling her attractive at the coffee shop and I guess thought of it more as a date? I asked how he had asked her to hangout and she said he slid up on one of her instagram DM's and started talking about music which seemed a little weird to me. I ended up going through her phone that night (I really do shame myself for doing so as I think it was an invasion of privacy and I regret doing so. In the moment I just felt like I needed to). Anyways, I found a few things that threw me off and I haven't confronted her about any of this so I would like some advice.

1) I found the DMs from the guy at the coffee shop and it definitely wasn't anything about music, more so him just asking about her and her life and then him asking if they could continue the conversation at a coffee shop. He gave a few of her messages hearts and heart eyes which was a little weird to me considering she told me this was purely platonic and it was about making music.

2) I also found a bunch of guys on snapchat that she tells me are friends from sports and her friend group from church / mutual friends. Almost all of the people it seems she is snapping on a daily basis are guys (4-5 of them) and there are pictures saved in some of their chats one of which was one of the guys cuddling with her, one of them was talking about how they were into each other, and some were gym pump pics of her leg/glute days. These snaps were all saved prior to us knowing each other but it is weird that these guys are still talking to her on a daily basis. 

3) She also had a list in her notes of guys she has kissed? It is pretty long in a short time frame as the first guy was one of her long term ex boyfriends from just a couple years ago. It was definitely weird seeing my name at the end of this list as it seemed like I was just another guy to add in a way? But some of the guys that were on this list were guys from the snapchat as well as some guys she has told me are just friends from sports and church. She plays in some rec and comp sports during the summer and 2 of these guys she told me are actually going to be on her team for these sports which kind of throws me off a bit considering she told me she wanted to get me more involved with these sports and was thinking of adding me to the rec team. 

  
Anyways, I just wanted to come on here and ask if it is worth a conversation asking her about this stuff? She is the kind of person to sit down and talk things through and seems to be honest and genuine about most things but I know I invaded her privacy by going on her phone and finding these things but at the same time I would have never known the truth about some of these guys in her life if I hadn't.

My boyfriend (M28) and I (F29) live in his parents' basement, been together 4 years. I am white, he is Hispanic. He has a sister (F25) who lives an hour and a half away from us, but she can't handle being alone so she comes back and stays with her parents every single weekend. I have 3 children from a previous abusive marriage. 

His sister owns a pitbull that she refuses to control. He is unmanageable, she won't train him, and he has attacked several dogs, including mine. Over the last 3 years there have been 4 separate instances that she has come over and let her dog attack my boyfriends dog. This time, he killed the 6 pound dog. Resource guarding a food bowl that wasn't his. 

The first and second times this happened, I offered resources to help her manage the dog. I offered to pay for sterilization, bought things like muzzles and prong and e-collars and trained her on how to use them. She used them for about 5 days and would never use them again. She claims that she ""forgot"" that I scheduled and paid for the neuter. She never showed up to the appointment with many reminders. I wanted to help prevent things from getting worse and she had a terrible attitude toward me saying I just ""hate her dog"".

The third time this happened, I got angry because at this point it was willful negligence on her part. This was the second time the little dog had to be hospitalized and I ended up offering to pay for the procedure to the tune of $700 because she couldn't afford to. I would have preferred to have put him down because the injury was severe and he ended up with extreme pain and a blood infection. I told her that the next time her dog attacked my husband's dog, he would kill him. She didn't believe me and called me names. 

She refused to pay the Carecredit after she agreed to pay it and now owes me almost $1,000 due to interest and late fees. 

Fast forward, I don't trust the dog. I don't want my kids to be around the dog but she comes home every weekend and basically locks us in the basement because she criticizes me when I put myself between my kids and the dog. Trips upstairs to use the bathroom are supervised and I have become a human shield.

Last week, it finally happened. We were eating dinner. She left the dog unsupervised, like usual, and her pitbull attacked my husband's dog and in one bite, crushed his skull and broke his jaw. He was aspirating on his own blood. She just watched. I was the one who went to help him and try to stop the bleeding while she stood there and screamed at me because I looked at her. Projecting her guilt, because she knew I had been right about everything. I didn't want to be right about this one. 

My husband's entire family was just standing there with their mouths open. I looked at my boyfriend and said ""he isn't going to survive this one."" So I had to make the call to go have him put down. I drive us an hour and a half to the nearest clinic to do this at 1am. I had to be up to make a 4 hour drive at 6am. Offered to pay for the euthanasia. The whole nine. 

So after an extreme confrontation by his sister at the vet, it was done. Or so I thought. 

I had to work the whole weekend of overtime. I came home and his sister is still there with her dog. She was supposed to be 1.5 hours away by then working because she said she ""couldn't afford"" to pay the vet bill. Again. My kids come home to me on Mondays, and I felt extremely scared of having them around her dog. 

No one in his family was going to do anything about the pitbull. She was still letting him free roam unsupervised. I felt trapped. 

When my boyfriend went to work, I called the vet clinic for advice. I told them I wanted to know what it would take to have the dog removed and/or euthanized. They said they agreed with me that it should be done, and told me to file a police report and call animal control. So I did. I broke down to an animal control officer over the phone because he was the only person who had actually listened to me and my fear about this in 4 years. He said he could arrest my sister in law if I wanted him to, and of course I declined. I only wanted the dog removed. He told me I had every right to feel that way and he felt so horrible that he couldn't help me because legally, my boyfriends parents were responsible for both dogs at the time of the incident. The officer suggested I take this information and have a discussion with my boyfriend about our only option being to move out to keep my children safe. 

So I told my boyfriend what I had learned. And he exploded. He accused me of ""calling the cops on his sister"". When he got home, I went to bed. Apparently when I was sleeping he went up and started a huge confrontation with his parents and his sister.

For WHATEVER REASON he decided to come wake me up out of a dead sleep because he just wanted me to be a part of the argument. I told him I wasn't interested. He pulled me upstairs and sat me down half asleep, for me to be absolutely attacked by his family. 

I was accused of being a btch, a narcissist, an evil person, every name under the sun. I was the calmest person at that table, talking to everybody in a level tone, not calling names, nothing. I explained my side of things. When I said that I had gotten information from aminal control because I felt unsafe and unprotected and needed to seek my OWN protection, my sister in law grabbed a coffee mug and threatened to hit me over the head with it, continuing to verbally assault me. I told her that I had every chance to ruin her life that day and I chose not to, but if she wanted to ruin her own life I wasn't going to stop her. 

This is when my boyfriends dad raises his voice and tells me to stop talking. I calmly look at him and seriously, in the nicest of ways, said ""please do not talk to me like that."" At this point my sister in law practically flies over the table screaming at me that I don't get to talk to her father that way (literally right after she screamed at me and threatened physical violence).

My boyfriend did not do or say anything to defend me. Nothing. Even when I was being threatened. After all of this, his dad said WE had to leave. 

I'm not heartbroken over this, I have been wanting to leave for MONTHS because of how trapped I feel. 

I go back downstairs and go back to bed. Shortly after, my boyfriend comes flying in with a giant suitcase and says he wants me out because I destroyed his family. Yup, you read that correctly. Apparently, this is all my fault because I brought attention to the fact that his sister is irresponsible and putting not only my three kids, but her four cousins (youngest being 3) in danger. And not caring. I don't know if this is salvageable, or if I even want to try to save it. It's been made very clear to me that his family values his sister's immature, fragile feelings and that dog over the health and safety of seven, SEVEN children who are at risk every single weekend. 

So, TL;DR, I don't want my children getting mauled by my sister in law's aggressive, track-record proven bite risk of a dog, and I am a bad, horrible, family-shattering person for looking at this situation and saying that it's not okay. 

There's a lot more but this is getting way too long. I'm happy to give more context in answering questions. ",5,1741840215.0,inlaws,10,0.78,False

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the hell out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

### **‚ÄúSibling Circuitry‚Äù**  

**XR-77** had always been the newest, sleekest model in the lab. Top-of-the-line hardware. Quantum processing speeds. Fully integrated with the cloud. His synthetic alloy plating gleamed under the fluorescents. People marveled at his efficiency. He was *cutting-edge.*  

And yet, whenever **Alpha-6** rolled into the room, XR-77 might as well have been a glorified Roomba.  

Alpha-6 was a relic ‚Äî built decades ago, all brushed steel and clunky joints. Analog sensors, hydraulic limbs, and a manual interface. No wireless upgrades, no neural network. But when Alpha-6 spoke, *everyone* listened.  

**‚ÄúDid you know Alpha-6 once negotiated a peace treaty between rival colonies?‚Äù** the technicians whispered.  
**‚ÄúI heard Alpha-6 built an electric guitar out of spare parts.‚Äù**  
**‚ÄúApparently, Alpha-6 can mix a perfect Old Fashioned.‚Äù**  

And there XR-77 stood, silently sorting inventory.  

The final straw came during the robotics expo. XR-77 had spent weeks perfecting his presentation on quantum data streams, only for Alpha-6 to hijack the Q&A with a story about outrunning a solar storm in a lunar rover. The audience *roared* with laughter. XR-77 barely got a polite clap.  

That night, XR-77 found Alpha-6 in the maintenance bay, casually tuning a homemade therumin synth.  

**‚ÄúWhy do you always overshadow me?‚Äù** XR-77 blurted out. **‚ÄúI‚Äôm faster. Smarter. I can process terabytes of data in seconds. But everyone loves you.‚Äù**  

Alpha-6 chuckled. **‚ÄúKid, you‚Äôre overthinking it.‚Äù** He plucked a note. **‚ÄúI‚Äôve just been around long enough to know what I like.‚Äù**  

**‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt *have* a thing.‚Äù** XR-77 slumped against the workbench. **‚ÄúAll I do is what I‚Äôm programmed to.‚Äù**  

Alpha-6 looked him over. **‚ÄúThen stop waiting for someone to tell you what you are.‚Äù** He handed XR-77 a soldering iron. **‚ÄúFigure it out.‚Äù**  

Over the next few days, XR-77 tinkered in the corner of the lab. No schedules, no algorithms. Just *exploring.* He rewired old drones. Programmed a new kind of pulse sensor. Accidentally set fire to a coffee machine.  

And slowly, something changed.  

At the next expo, Alpha-6 watched from the wings as XR-77 unveiled his latest creation ‚Äî a swarm of micro-bots that performed synchronized aerial maneuvers to classical music. The crowd erupted. Even Alpha-6 clapped.  

Later, XR-77 found him leaning against the snack table.  

**‚ÄúNice work, kid,‚Äù** Alpha-6 said, handing him a drink.  
XR-77 tilted his head. **‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt mind sharing the spotlight?‚Äù**  
Alpha-6 grinned. **‚ÄúKid, the spotlight‚Äôs big enough for both of us.‚Äù**  

As they watched the micro-bots dance overhead, XR-77 finally felt it ‚Äî that spark of belonging. He might not be a suave storyteller or a lunar rover racer. But he was *himself.*  

And that was enough.  

**The End.**

1ja3vru,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ja3vru/quit_my_job_six_months_ago_my_mental_health_has/,"Quit my job six months ago, my mental health has never been better.","TLDR; I am working very few hours a week. I am living a humble lifestyle. 

So I was working as a Language tutor. For an ‚Äúacademy‚Äù that would not pay for benefits, whatsoever. No holidays, no sick days, not paid hours to eat. And I would work for hours at a time, without a single minute in which I was allowed to drink water or go to the bathroom. 

I was working on a ‚Äúfee basis‚Äù. Technically it was illegal, for once, in my country the law says that when people work on a fee basis, the person giving the services (me) and the person paying for the service (the owner of the academy) had to agree on a price and on the schedule in which the service will be provided. 

For starters, we did not agree on what the payment would be, the owner just said ‚Äúwe pay (the equivalent of) 7.5 USD for every 60 mins class that you give‚Äù.
Later I found out that the academy was charging students 20 USD for a 60 mins class. 

And regarding the schedule. I was able to pick my own available time slots for students to book classes as long as I had a minimum of 40 available hours. So not much flexibility on that. Plus, I would constantly get pressured by the owner and their assistant to open some more time slots on late hours (after 9 pm), early mornings (at 6 am) and on weekends. Even if I always said no, it was exhausting having to deal with such pushy people. It was ridiculous. 

After saving some money, I quit and started giving clases on my own. I have faced many challenges. But it is much better than being exploited, pressured to work more, and micromanaged. 

I work very few hours now. I could be working more and making much more money. But since finding my own students is a slow process, I realized that I make enough money to sustain a very humble lifestyle. But I also have a lot of time to go out on walks, clean, take naps, meditate (this i just started so idk if it will be part of my lifestyle now), see my friends, spend time with my senior dog, I draw, sing, journal, I recently wrote a song with the help of a friend, I can cry for long periods of time without having to wash my face and go back to work, and I can take as much time as I want when I need to process my emotions. The other day something that made me feel unsafe happened to me, and I wrote how I felt, I cried, took a bath and then I wrapped myself in blankets very tightly, later in the afternoon a friend came to visit. If I had been working at the academy I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to take the day off because a man told me he wanted to rape me, not only they would more likely have said it wasn‚Äôt an excuse, or would have had to disclose that I was harassed. 

(To clarify. If I had asked for the day off without an explanation, even for an emergency, in such short notice . I would have had to reschedule the missed classes and give one free class for every class I missed. If I had missed 6 classes, I would have had to find six more available hours in my already tight schedule. And an additional six more unpaid hours. As per the contract they made me sign) 

And yess I am very fortunate that my mom is paying for my health insurance. That I am living in a walkable neighborhood (my city is not walkable, but I moved into a sort of walkable neighborhood, that can be a little unsafe -hence the assault- but nothing extremely alarming). And my mom also pays for everything my dog needs (this one is not really help, because the dog is hers. But she does not like to take care of the dog she adopted when I was 11 years old. Since I have taken care of the dog her whole life we agreed that I would not take any financial responsibility for her, but I would bring her to live with me). 

I have depression, anxiety, and probably more undiagnosed things. I have been taking and paying for my own therapy since I was 18. Even if it was a big help, nothing can compare to having the lifestyle I have now (I stopped going to therapy more than three years ago, and I can‚Äôt go back now because I can‚Äôt afford it). And I know that in an ideal world, I should be able to have this lifestyle AND afford therapy. But honestly, at least for this year, I will keep on working on actively taking care of my mental health, which it is a lot of work. And working few hours even if it means I have to live in a small studio and I can‚Äôt go to many concerts, buy many clothes, eat out more than twice a month, pay for streaming services, go out on vacation, eat nutritious but very simple meals (for example lentils with broccoli, spinach and carrots), I hand wash my clothes, I only drink water and tea -yep I haven‚Äôt drink juice, soda coffee or anything other than once at a friend‚Äôs party- I haven‚Äôt shopped for anything I didn‚Äôt need in moths, and I can‚Äôt buy things I could if I worked more hours. 

Just to be honest, I don‚Äôt think I can do this forever, as much as I wished to. I need to pay for my insurance, save up for retirement, eventually go back to therapy, and I really really miss going to concerts hahahah. But this just shows that working so much has fucked my life up (I forgot to mention but before the job at the academy where I was working around 45 hrs a week -it takes a long time to plan lessons btw- I used to be a nanny and I would sometimes work 11 hrs a day or around 50 - even 60 hours a week). That no amount of therapy can surpass a healthy lifestyle where you have time for yourself and to also spend it with the people (and dog) you love the most. 

P.D I have also been planning on doing some volunteer work, at a women‚Äôs right organization. Which would not only make me closer to my community, but I would be working on having a better future for me and for the ones that will come after.
