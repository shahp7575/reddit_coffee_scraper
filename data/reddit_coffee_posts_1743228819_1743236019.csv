The air in 88 hung heavy, thick with the scent of decay and forgotten things. Time, in this forgotten corner of the world, was not a linear progression, but a tangled knot, a twisted tapestry woven with threads of the past, present, and future. Elias Thorne, a man haunted by echoes of moments yet to come, found himself drawn into this temporal anomaly, a town where the calendar bled, shadows consumed the daylight, and the dead whispered secrets from beyond the veil.

This is 88, where the boundaries of reality blur, and the horrors of time's distortion manifest in the everyday. Prepare to journey with Elias through the decaying streets, encounter the children with eyes like clocks, and confront the entity that holds this town captive in its twisted grip. But be warned, traveler, for in 88, the past, present, and future are intertwined, and escape may not be possible.



**Part One: The Whispering Cracks**

1. **Chapter 1: The Whispering Asphalt:** Introduction to 88 through the eyes of our protagonist, Elias Thorne, a man haunted by a recurring deja vu. He discovers the cracks in the road whispering names, and a sense of dread settles in.
2. **Chapter 2: The Empty Diner, Forever Noon:** Elias seeks refuge in the diner, finding its occupants trapped in a perpetual noon, their conversations looping, their coffee stains telling fragmented futures.
3. **Chapter 3: The Calendar That Bleeds:** He finds a calendar where each date is a wound, dripping a viscous, dark fluid. He notices dates changing, disappearing, and reappearing.
4. **Chapter 4: The Children with Eyes of Old Clocks:** Elias encounters children with eyes that tick, their gazes counting down to an unknown event. They play games of ""Temporal Tag,"" where losers vanish.
5. **Chapter 5: The Shadow of the Sundial:** The town's sundial casts an impossibly long shadow, a creeping darkness that consumes the hours, and Elias witnesses objects and people being swallowed by it.

**Part Two: The Tangled Threads**

1. **Chapter 6: The Echo of the Train That Never Arrived:** A phantom train whistle haunts Elias, a sound that no one else seems to hear. He finds an abandoned train station, its tracks leading nowhere.
2. **Chapter 7: The Photographs That Change Faces:** Elias discovers photographs that shift, faces morphing into grotesque masks, revealing hidden histories and alternate realities.
3. **Chapter 8: The Radio Station That Plays Dead Air, and Then...:** He tunes into a radio station that broadcasts only static, until a chilling voice breaks through, speaking in reverse.
4. **Chapter 9: The Deja Vu That Never Ends:** Elias's sense of deja vu intensifies, becoming a suffocating loop of familiarity, a feeling that he's lived this moment countless times.
5. **Chapter 10: The Objects That Remember Their Past Lives:** A rusty key unlocks a forgotten murder, a locket reveals a frozen moment of terror, and other objects whisper their dark secrets.

**Part Three: The Rotting Core**

1. **Chapter 11: The Rust-Colored Fog:** A corrosive fog rolls into 88, eroding time itself, aging everything it touches. Elias sees buildings crumble and people wither.
2. **Chapter 12: The Skin That Peels Away, Revealing Old Age:** The fog accelerates the aging process, turning people into withered husks, their skin peeling away to reveal skeletal forms.
3. **Chapter 13: The Voices That Speak in Reverse:** Elias deciphers the reversed voices, learning of 88's twisted history and the entity that controls it.
4. **Chapter 14: The Man Who Sells Hours:** Elias encounters a man who peddles stolen hours, his wares cursed and tainted. Elias is offered a chance to buy back lost time.
5. **Chapter 15: The Preacher Who Speaks in Prophecies of the Past:** A mad preacher warns of the ""Time Weavers"" and the impending collapse of 88, his prophecies echoing past events.

**Part Four: Breaking the Loop**

1. **Chapter 16: The Abandoned Amusement Park, Where Rides Loop Forever:** Elias ventures into the amusement park, where rides are trapped in endless cycles, a reflection of 88 itself.
2. **Chapter 17: The Hospital Where Patients Relive Their Deaths:** He finds a hospital where patients are forced to relive their final moments, their screams echoing through time.
3. **Chapter 18: The Mirror That Shows Your Future Corpse:** Elias confronts his own mortality in a mirror that shows his decaying future self.
4. **Chapter 19: The Key That Unlocks Doors to Other Timelines:** He discovers a key that unlocks portals to alternate realities, glimpses of what could have been.
5. **Chapter 20: The Chronal Parasites:** Elias learns about the creatures feeding on 88's fragmented time, and how they contribute to the town's decay.

**Part Five: The Endings That Never End**

1. **Chapter 21: The Last Sunset That Repeats:** The sun sets, but it never fades, a perpetual twilight that signals the final loop.
2. **Chapter 22: The Time Weavers:** Elias confronts the entity controlling 88, the Time Weavers, beings that manipulate the threads of reality.
3. **Chapter 23: The Endless Staircase:** Elias finds himself on an endless staircase, a symbol of the infinite loops of time, and he has to make a choice.
4. **Chapter 24: The Last Door That Opens to Another Beginning:** Elias makes his choice, stepping through a door to a new reality, leaving 88 behind, but carrying its scars.
5. **Chapter 25: The Silent Bells:** The bells of 88, which had been silent, ring out, but backwards, signaling either a reset or a final, irreversible change. The ending is left ambiguous, a lingering sense of unease.

Hey everyone. So my birthday is coming up and for the last couple years I've made myself a strawberry pie for each birthday, it had pastry cream (I was also thinking of making a coffee flavored pastry cream this year) with strawberries on top.

This year however has been.... a very difficult struggle. My whole family is sick now, my mom's losing her kidney, my grandfather has cancer, I have a brain tumor, so this year everything has kinda been crashing down, I lost almost all my friends since I can't leave my house, so it's been hard.

So whenever I wasn't feeling too bad, I made chocolate cupcakes to sell, I have a very good recipe and everyone in my house likes it. And for some reason I just got it into my head that I want to make the chocolate cake for my birthday... but I also don't want to leave my traditional strawberry pie

So I wanted to ask if anyone had a creative idea of how I could fuse them? I was thinking maybe baking a thin layer of cake and putting it in between the dough and the pastry cream? I'm not sure if that could work. Any ideas? Opinions?",1,1743235875.0,Baking,0,1.0,False

I had ACDF surgery Feb 24 - C5/C6. Surgery went well. During recovery I had bad pain which lingered etc. surgeon signed me off 6 months later saying the surgery was a total success ‘mechanically’ ie it worked in terms of decompression.
Head and neck pain continued. In around May I noticed a dull ache in my forearms (left arm being the main issue).. think when sitting at desk and picking up a cup of tea /coffee I felt the dull ache. It worsened. September time it began to localise in elbows again with left being worst.
Now March 25 it’s awful. Particularly in bed and when waking…. I sleep with bent arms and when I wake and stretch them the pain is horrific. Lifting things really hurts …
My NHS doctor is simply saying it could be scar tissue from operation and I’m taking all the nerve meds - now I’ve moved to pregabalin. All they do is help sleep they don’t reduce pain. 
I’ve started researching and found this Post cervical surgery syndrome which specifically relates to scar tissue impinging the nerve root .. it sounds like this is the cause of my issue.
Has anyone else experienced what I’m going through, particularly the elbow joints being in agony post ACDF (and this built steadily over the post op period - never had any issues with arms before, no trauma, etc.)? And what did you do to help?",1,1743235854.0,spinalfusion,0,1.0,False

1jmhhfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perimenopause/comments/1jmhhfe/im_done_with_doctors/,I'm done with doctors.,"I'm 41 and have bad insomnia, for years.  
I also suspect that i have ADHD and that perimenopause makes it really worst, Brain fog, loss of energy, food rampage... (i can get depisted for ADHD but it's 5 months of waiting, 1500 bucks,4 appointments and then i will only be given expensive advices to manage it. so i chose to seek theses advices for free instead.... ) 

for years i tried everything, lavender, sport, stopping coffee, stopping alcohol, meditation, tea, magnesium , CBD, yoga, and more.... finally i DRAW my sleepless nights for 18 months and goes to the doctor with it , showing that i can't live on an average of 4-5 h of sleep each night (usually divided in twice) and he gave me trimipramin, which help most of the time, even if i'm still always tired and wake up 12 time a night. 

Here is what my gyno told me through the years about perimenopause( which is obviously the root of the issues):

\- at 38 : you're too young  
\- at 39 : you're too young   
\- at 40 : you're depressed to be old ( i cried because i was sick, tired, and expected that she would stop to tell me i'm too young and actually help for once) she just gave me progesteron birth control for my constant spotting (She said that my hair are broken because lack of iron... i never told anything about my hair but thanks to notice that i burned it with bleach i guess)   
\- at 41 :  you're not menopausal, i'll give you no hormones, you're depressed, what does your psychiatrist tells ?  but oh you pee 17 time a day in average, so i'll refer you to a gyno/urologist. and she gave me oestrogen/progesteron BC  
She said that i also have diabetes (it's tested, and no) or/and kidney issue, or/and iron deficit (already tested and no)   
i have no psychiatrist because it cost 300 buck an hour, and i'm already working, raising kid, and so on, i don't feel ''liberated'' to have someone to talk, i just feel like having one more (expensive) chore. That and because psychiatrists already failed me 10 years ago...  
  
Anyways i went to the urologist... since maybe i have kidney issue.... it was painful and humiliating exams for 1h30, then i had to ''talk'' with him for another hours because he think i'm depressed (he admitted being friend of my gyno...) ask what my psychologist told (damn) and told that i have no libido because my BF is a jerk, that if we argue about the mess we can just hire a maid and other greately personalised advices (/s) like don't argue before bed or communicate....telling me that i should talk. then proceed to talk about his friends and patients for one hour... i couldn't even speak...  
i guess spotting, occasional hot flush, bloated legs and night sweat in JANUARY are symptoms of depression.... (/s again, sorry, i'm jaded) 

oh i saw another gyno this year, because i was tired of taking shit.... she just was so late for the apt that it was basically 15 minutes of her building my file and telling ""go for what your gyno gave you, if it's not better we will make hormonal bloodwork""(which is BS anyway). 100 bucks and half a day, gone. 

so i'm done. 

Totally done. 

and there is no telehealth in switzerland. 

Next year my gyno will ask how i am, i'll talk about the hot flush, bloated legs, night sweat and stop there.   
Why do we have to sort out ALL others diagnostics, which take times and cost A LOT, when she could just try to give me something for 3 months and see if it help or not ? 

oh and i plan to return to (illegal) pots, since it's the only thing i don't tried already... 

Well anyways, my sisters, thank you for reading me. I hope you have more success in your search of HRT...

I tested it for 30 days with **zero changes** to my diet or routine. Just slowly started taking the new natural supplements.

🔥 **Energy Boost**: No more mid-day crashes. I feel dialed in all day, even without coffee.

At first, I thought it was placebo, but by **week 2, the effects were undeniable**. And I’m not the only one—apparently, top-level athletes and entrepreneurs use this same stack.

I got the beans grounded from Blue Tokai itself. Got different grind sizes (2, 2.5, 3, 3.5) to test which ones work better but turns out most of them turn out to be watery. Some get too sour and some get too bitter; after which I realised it has more to do with my technique.

Just woke up. Pretty much fell asleep straight away once I got into bed last night. Think it was around 10ish. Leaving for work around half 11 later so got a few hours to get bits done. 

How was yesterday? Everything ready? I’m sure it is and that there’s only a few bits to do today. Start your day off well, have a smoke, your coffee and some cookies. Knowing you, you ain’t going to eat much later so at least fuel up at the start of the day. From what I can see, the sun is out even though it’s a little nippy. One less thing to worry about. 

Hope you take some time to enjoy the day rather than just being host. I’m sure she’ll have an amazing time. 

Will speak to you soon. Have a good day. I miss you x",1,1743234493.0,ICIMI2,0,1.0,False
1jmha0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/PSSD/comments/1jmha0k/healing_after_12_months_of_pssd/,Healing after 12 months of PSSD.,"I took Lexapro for few days 12 months ago and  from the fist few pills I developed penis numbness, complete emonational blunting, no feeling of hunger or thirst, no libido, erectile dysfunction and brain zaps. I also had horrendous cognitive problems, could not listen to music or work, had terrible memory. I also had muscle twitching and apathy towards life. I also felt pressure-sensation in my head.

From my experience PSSD is set of symptoms that each recover in a different speed. Maybe some functions of brain are ""easier"" to fix than others. I do not think that PSSD symptoms should each be expected to recover at the same time. Despide the popular belief, I think SSRIs break multiple unrelated things at once in the brain instead of causing one big part of brain system to break that controlled everything. Think about PSSD like being in a car crash, the same crash causes multiple organs to be damaged but that doesn't necessarily mean that the organs are related, it just means they were damaged at the same time. I see PSSD kinda like this way. This would explain why some things recover faster than other things.

I also noticed that any substance like coffee or alcohol made me crash, so I do not recommend taking anything that messes with the brain. This is my recovery timeline so far.

I feel like penis numbness is the fist symptom that improved for me, not fully but about couple days after quitting SSRI I gained some sensivity back.

Two weeks after quitting I got some of my hunger and thirst back and could listen to music again and my memory was improving and I understood things better.

Then it was about 5-8 months of little to no improvement. I still had complete emonational blunting and no libido during this time. And no orgasms.

At 9 months of PSSD I suddenly regained my ability to orgasm, it was not exactly the same as before but definitely an insane improvement. It was no longer a question of ""was this real or just placebo"" as the feeling felt so intense, it's like I forgot what orgasm felt like and suddenly felt it again. The orgasms kinda came and went in waves but I noticed that the periods where I couldn't orgasms become shorter and the better periods were longer.  Also at 9 months I gained my first small bursts of libido for couple days but it really came and went.

After that it was couple months again where there was not that much improvement and I actually felt that I was going backwards in healing and actually worsening.

And now at 11 months I have had massive improvenent.  I feel like I have regained some of my libido back and actually can feel horny again, not as strongly as before but I fully believe that with time I recover fully to the back I used to be. Also my erectile dysfunction is completely away and penis numbness too. So I pretty much recovered from the sexual symptoms one symtom at a time. Feeling horny after 11 months is kinda insane. My first thought after being horny was ""damn people feel like this all the time?"". Horiness is like a full body feeling where you get a big urge for sex. I'm telling you this because I literally forgot what being horny feels like until I experienced it again.

Emonational blunting has not yet been fully recovered, however, I no longer feel just pressure in my head. I think before when I was in situations where I should had felt some emotions I just felt pressure in my head. My head no longer feels empty and I actually feel emotions, but not that strongly but enough so I know they are in there.

I doubt my recovery suddenly just stops here, I am optimistic and hoping that I'm heading towards a full recovery.

My theory on why I recover and some people don't is the time people were on the medication. I was on the meds extremely short period so my brain had almost instantly chance to begin recovery. I think if you get PSSD and are still on the meds after that for a long period your brain kinda misses the initial chance for recovery. Maybe by quitting the meds quickly after starting I was able to avoid the worst case scenario.

To be honest, I feel like my situation feels different from most people here as from what I have read, some people can tolerate the meds months or years before developing PSSD symptoms. For me I like got PSSD almost instantly so I think despide the symptoms being the same I think the mechanic that happened is completely different.

Could I still be having withdrawal symptoms? I'm thinking this because I still get brain zaps and most people with PSSD do not get brain zaps. ",0,1743234400.0,PSSD,1,0.5,False
1jmh9pu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1jmh9pu/my_cat_didnt_want_to_die/,my cat didn't want to die,"When I took my cat to the vet today, I really thought I'd be taking her home. I know she's been uncomfortable and in some pain, and getting rounder in the midsection, but other than crying sometimes at night and some heavy breathing here and there, she's been herself. We had our coffee time on the porch this morning and she was up ready for food like always, played with toys yesterday. I told her when we went to the vet that they were gonna make her feel better and we'll come home right after (bc she really hates car rides). But xrays revealed congestive heart failure and all of her roundness was actually fluid. I knew some was fluid (bc I unfortunately lost a dog to something similar) but I expected at least some of her girth to be fat as she's always been a big girl, but, nope, that xray looked like a balloon. 

Everybody I talked to in my short timespan to decide what to do said they would euthanize in this situation bc you don't want them to suffer a worse death and she could die at any time at that point. And I agreed, but, she very clearly did not want to die there. She knew what was going on and she just wanted to go home. When I asked her if she was ready, she buried her face in my leg which is a clear no for her. I thought she was just understandably scared but it was only after it was too late did it occur to me she would have definitely preferred to have died at home. Or at least later. Even if just a few days later.

She tried to escape before and after the sedative. Then she had to have a second dose of the sedative, the first attempt of which she broke the needle and ripped out her IV catheter by leaping off the table and running into her crate. When they got the second dose in the back she hissed at that guy like hell, which she's never done in her entire life. Even when she was double sedated and unable to move, she was still looking right in my eyes and I could tell she still wanted to run. For context, she does hide at the vet but is really cooperative and with shots too, so for her to even try to get off the table before the first sedative tells me she knew what was happening. By the time I realized how much she opposed the decision, it was already too late. 

I wish I would've at least explained to her that she was going to keep getting worse. Or, you know, just taken her home and took more time to decide. Medicine for the swelling was an option but had to be taken three times a day and I'm the only one that can get her to take pills. She's been living with my mother since I'm in a college dorm. There's no way she would've gotten all the medicine she needed, so I figured it was all just prolonging her increasing discomfort. I was so overwhelmed I didn't really even talk to her that much, I just told her that they weren't going to take her back there again (they took her back to put the catheter in). It all happened so fast. While I agree it was probably the kind of objectively right decision to euthanize her, I feel like it was my responsibility to be her advocate for what she wanted and I failed her at that. I think she fully expected me to get the medicine and take her home.

Side note from the point: the guy that was euthanizing her asked me what I was studying in college while we were waiting for the second sedative to take effective? I politely answered his questions but internally I was like uhhh my cat is about to die, I really don't care about school right now. I thought that was... in bad taste. I mean, I wasn't a sobbing mess like my mom was but still, that doesn't mean I'm in a chatty mood.",3,1743234360.0,Petloss,2,1.0,False
1jmh8en,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1jmh8en/looking_forward_to_next_week/,Looking Forward to Next Week,"You know why we don't have a pharmacy school? It's because we already have a bunch of condom sellers and giveaway places on campus. No need for a designated degree for that. Plus, we all know how to count stuff like pills or those things many of you like to call drugs. 


I so look forward to next week. I mean like, fucking...walk back to school wearing my backpack. Or getting up early with a coffee in my hand on the balcony wearing just a robe watching the staff drive to work as I hit the gym half naked in the cold ass morning (sometimes I wear the robe like I'm about to enter a boxing match). It's my way of telling people to move because I'm about to use the weight lifting equipment. 

You know, I wonder if there are any guys who were okay with their girlfriends going on trips to Cancun without them...I'm sure there are. I remember last year I found a ticket to Vegas for really cheap and my classmate's mom got mad until I invited her. It was better we both went instead of just me. 

If guys go together, they think they're going to hook up but end up either getting drunk and playing Spin the Bottle with each other, or, even worse; Truth or Dare. During freshman year, I went to Vegas with some buddies. We were all under 21. And like, fucking...played Truth or Dare and we dared one brave man to run around the hotel hallway naked and we locked him outside. 

Oh, and then one bald guy who already lost a bet with us had his head shaved the day before....we found a courtesy wheelchair from the hotel. The courtesy wheelchair if for people who are feigning injury and drunk but don't want to fall. Our bald friend was persuaded into sitting in the chair and they placed him inside the elevator while pressing all the buttons as he was drunk. We didn't see him until the lobby woke us all up and security knocked on our door as we all scrambled to wear a towel around our boxers. 

I was coming back from the pool and some random lady pulled my towel as I played tug of war but I wasn't even naked underneath. The worst part of fun spring breaks is how quickly they end...and how most of us lose touch even when we're all in the same ass class. 

The group of friends I had in freshman year...they taught me to go to nursing homes and play dirty songs on my guitar and talk about dating and sex from the most experienced of people. Now it's like everyone went their separate ways. 

The break brought out the ghosts of the past...and it was scary. I'm most of all happy to see everyone coming back. I got so bored after work one night, I went to Subway and asked for 11 and a half olives on my sandwich to see if the sandwich maker, or artist as they prefer to be called, would say anything to me. Instead, I got a sandwich with 11 and a half olives....not fun! I'd rather cook naked at my place!

Both of my grandparents were diagnosed with cancer, and sadly, they passed. It was a traumatic experience that made us all mentally age about 10 years, give or take.

After a few years of mourning, things started to heal, and we were trying to get back to life. We weren’t really living before—we were just trying to survive.

I got married super young, probably too young, honestly. I wasn’t ready. I was just a kid. But I’m glad I did, because I have two beautiful and healthy boys—although, yes, they can be little assholes most of the time. 

Here’s where things started to go downhill. I was supposed to focus on building a career, creating a foundation for my family. But I got into gambling. It started small with scratch-offs and lottery tickets, but then I took it further with online gambling. That’s when it really kicked my ass. 

It consumed me. Every paycheck, every dollar I made, all I could think about was putting it into those online slots. Sure, I won a few times, but mostly I lost—badly. I probably emptied my entire savings just to keep playing. It went on like that for years, until I was put in charge of managing some money for my father. I ended up losing a third of it, and let me tell you, that feeling was soul-crushing. If there was ever a time for a heart attack, it was then. 

But instead of stopping, I made even dumber decisions to try and replace the money I lost. I put myself deep in debt. I was down and out, stressed to the point where I felt like my heart was going to explode. 

Then, one day, my wife came to me saying we needed a few things for the house. I was already in a bad place, but I drove to the store to get what we needed. As I sat at the light, thinking about how I was going to make ends meet, I saw the lottery machine. I had $6 in change in my pocket, so I thought, why not? Things couldn’t get any worse. 

I bought two quick-pick tickets and picked my own numbers for a third ticket in the Mega Millions. I left the store thinking, *If I even match five numbers, I’ll be happy*, but honestly, I didn’t really care. My chances of winning felt like getting struck by lightning twice.

The next day was Saturday, the day of the drawing. I completely forgot about the tickets in my car. The day passed uneventfully, just another day of stressing over how to come up with money. A few days later, I went to my local gas station, and the clerk said, ""Hey, did you buy any tickets from the grocery store? The Mega Millions ticket was sold there a few days ago.""

That’s when my heart dropped. I remembered the tickets in my car. I ran to my car, grabbed the tickets, and started matching the numbers. First one was a loser. Second one was a loser. At this point, I was just hoping that somehow, someway, the third one would be the winner. 

I matched the first number. Then the second. Then the third And so on, Sweat started pouring down my face. I was shaking and simultaneously felt like I might throw up. I didn’t even know how much I won. but at that moment, I didn’t care. I knew I’d be set, even with a few million. I drove straight to the lottery office, not even fully processing what was happening. 

They confirmed it: I had won $1.2 billion. I chose the lump sum and remained anonymous. After a few hours of background checks to confirm I was the rightful owner, they wrote me a check for $419 million, tax-free. 

Imagine going from flat broke, deep in debt, to driving to the bank with a check for $419 million. I wasn’t prepared for this. I hadn’t even brushed my teeth or had coffee yet. I looked like a wreck. But there I was, shaking at the bank, handing over the check to the cashier and saying, “I’d like to cash this.” 

The cashier looked at the amount, then looked at me and said, “I need to get my manager.” The manager greeted me and took me into the back room to confirm everything. Once it was all cleared, they cashed the check and put a hold on it for a few days to make sure it cleared. 

During this time, they asked me what my plans were—how I’d invest the money, what I’d do with it. I felt totally out of my depth, so I said, “Let’s wait until the check clears, and I’ll be back.”

I went home and was numb, just refreshing my bank app over and over for the next two days. I didn’t work. I just stared at the screen, unsure of what was next. 

Then, one morning, I got a text: “Your check has cleared. Your available balance is $419,000,000.” 

I clicked the app and saw it. Generational wealth, right there in front of me. I got out of bed like Superman, drove straight to the bank, and withdrew $20,000. I paid off every bill I had—credit cards, loans, everything. When you spend $20,000 out of $419 million, it doesn’t even make a dent. It felt like infinite money.

By 8 a.m., I was debt-free. No worries. 

I instantly had money burning a hole in my pocket, so I bought my dream truck I paid for it in full with my debit card. My *debit card*. It felt unreal. 

Then, I went to the fancy mall and spent $50,000 on Rolexes, clothes, toys, jewelry for my family. I filled the entire back seat of my truck. It was a total splurge, and I was loving it. 

But my real joy came from taking care of my family. I went home and logged into the mortgage company’s website. I paid off my dad’s house, then deposited $25 million into his account. About an hour later, I got a text from him: ""I think there's a bank glitch—did you send money to my account?""

I smiled and replied, “No, it’s not a glitch. We need to talk. I’ll be home soon.”

When I got home, he was sitting there, stunned. I told him what happened:

**Father**: “What’s going on? What did you do?”

**Me**: “I might’ve won the lottery…” I smiled as I said it.

**Father**: “How much did you win?”

**Me**: “$419 million, after taxes.”

**Father**: “Oh my God… Did you tell anyone?”

**Me**: “No, no one knows yet. But I wanted to make sure we were set up. I paid off the mortgage and put $25 million in your account. Pay off any debt you have, and just enjoy life. You’ve earned it.”

He didn’t know what to say. We hugged, shedding a few tears. It was an amazing day.

I spent the rest of the day giving presents to my family—watches, necklaces, jewelry. When I handed my wife her gifts, she was overwhelmed with emotion. We all went to a high-end restaurant to celebrate, and when we came home, I felt a sense of joy I had never experienced before.

The next day, I made sure to take care of my other family members, giving them money to pay off debts and improve their lives. It felt so good to give back.

A couple of days later, I met with wealth advisors. Turns out, if I put most of the money into a high-yield savings account, I’d earn around $16 million in passive income every year. Just for leaving it in the account. That’s insane.

I set up some spending money, invested the rest, and started thinking about businesses. I opened an auto detailing shop that became an instant success. After that, I got into car sales, creating a family business that allowed everyone to make a good living.

A year went by, and everything was great. My wealth kept growing, and my family was thriving. I even bought a house, decorated it, and turned it into a home—complete with a mancave. 

Then, I ventured into real estate. I bought rental properties, and eventually an apartment complex that made me an additional $50,000–$60,000 per month in profit.

Looking at all I had built—from the businesses to the assets—I realized just how much my life had changed. All of this started with a single lottery ticket.  And went to rest


Then, I woke up…

I was lying in my old bed at my father’s house, the same one I’d fallen asleep in. The tickets were all losers. The weight of everything hit me in that moment, and I realized I’d been living in a fantasy. But the feeling of hope? That was real.

Nothing (other than time- like days of time) gets rid of the filmy feeling and it seems to impact my taste as well.  I already have lessened tastes when the dentures are in, I know due to the palate being covered as well as the amount of adhesive I’m having to use on my lower dentures to keep them solidly in place.  I had hoped that when removing them i would be able to fully appreciate some tastes again (even though I still can’t have specific foods that are hard or crunchy or need to be thoroughly chewed) but even with them out and my mouth cleaned and rinsed, I still feel the film and either taste the residual adhesive or continue to have the lessened tastes.  For example- ice cream has next to no taste with dentures in, dentures out I can only barely taste the flavor of whatever ice cream I’m eating.         

So, Im wondering a few things about this…    

A) I am alone in experiencing this or is it common?      

B) if not common, am I doing something wrong to cause this?      

C) is there a way to correct/fix this issue?     

I am just on the verge of a depressive breakdown over how boring (blame the ADHD) and bland and tasteless everything is.  I get NO enjoyment out of food or eating- which I suppose could be a good thing for both my waist and my wallet…but I already gave up so much prior to having my extractions- pack a day smoking (2.5 years now- so not the culprit) cut waaaaay back on coffee and soda.  I just want to enjoy a little treaty treat or even a cup of ramen.      

Any help appreciated.  Thanks!!! 

Also to add info- had my extractions done in Aug last year, no temps, got my perms in Dec., I know my bottoms are f*ckd and a realign isn’t going to fix them- I have next to no gum/bone on the right side of my lower jaw and thus the bottoms won’t fit proper without getting implants- which I absolutely can’t afford - so for the interim (forseeable future) adhesives are my only option.

When we met, she was fully prepared with her laptop and projects, while I had nothing presentable, which made me feel embarrassed. I thought it would be a casual discussion, not a formal networking opportunity. Afterward, she sent me a long message saying I bombed the opportunity, that she had worked in the industry since she was nine without any help, and that I was rude and should not move to LA. I did not feel I was rude I listened, engaged, and showed interest, even though her work was not my style.

She then tested my memory of a scene she had me read, and when I could not recall it perfectly, she got upset. I explained I have memory issues due to multiple brain injuries, but she accused me of using that as an excuse. That really offended me because my health issues are a real struggle. At that point, I lost my patience and asked how she worked on a major script at 14 and if she had an IMDb page. She blew up at me. I tried to end the conversation on a good note because I dislike negativity.

Even though she was rude, I still feel bad. I honestly think she has her own issues that made her act this way, and I sympathize with that, which makes this whole situation even harder for me. AITA?

This was very useful for me, but looking at other ways how I can address this. For sure, I could follow financial gurus or economy experts, but my values are different from theirs and I can't really relate to them.

Do you guys feel like this? Anyone on the same boat? At least I got some insights with chatgpt, maybe I'll pack that as an app others can use, but don't know if it's something people would like using.",1,1743233306.0,Adulting,0,1.0,False

So I have always had a hard time falling asleep. As a child/younger adult i would always read to sleep, but once I got a partner I found it impossible to do, i also had a hard time finding books I enjoy.

I now basically cannot fall asleep with out head phones listening to boring YouTube videos. I need the input otherwise my brain just won't shut up. 

I know most people say to journal or write down the stresses of the day, the issue is my brain will bring up situations from 8th grade, or 4 months ago, or I'll get stuck thinking about weird scenarios. 

Anyways I'm sure many understand, writing in a note book/diary etc has never been a habit I formed or something I liked either way. 
My hubby is concerned because I will lie away for hours if I don't put my head phones in and he says it's not normal (he's the type who puts his head down and sleeps). 

I'm looking for help to see what i can do to not be dependent on my phone or tablet to sleep....!

I've recently starting reading NG works and browsing the subreddit for information and studying. 

My main goal, like most here, is to manifest my SP. Old story, we had an off-on situationship before she lost feelings. I tried to force the narrative and messaged her a few days ago but she didn't even view the message.

As many have suggested, I thought I'd test the law out, firstly I wanted to find money on the floor, low and behold that afternoon as I was sitting watching my son play football, I found a coin in the grass next to me. Okay, could be a coincidence I said to myself but still cool nonetheless.

Then yesterday my next test was that I wanted to receive something free, could be a coffee or beer or anything. The following morning I get a letter through the door, Amazon giving me 3 months free Audible subscription. Keep in mind I've never used Audible before nor have I received this letter in the past.

That afternoon as I was walking down the road, I daydreamed how nice it would be to bump into my SP and have a nice catch-up as we walk, we haven't spoken in person for months. As I walk down the road, she parked up right next to me and I shit you not, it played out exactly like I imagined. 

Another strange thing which I didn't realise until after, the other day I saw ducks outside my house which i don't think I've ever seen before as it's a street in a town. My SP told me during our conversation ""did I tell you I have ducks now?""

Im going to assume this is all linked, my SC is sky rocketing.

Not the most interesting of posts I know but these things certainly are making me believe the law is real.",9,1743232645.0,lawofassumption,0,1.0,False

Do they scream ""mystery and allure"" or ""main character energy""? Let’s talk about fiery frames and their undeniable power!","I liked the way you described the aura of [red glasses](https://specscart.co.uk/glasses/red-glasses); they are just perfect. In my opinion, these glasses don’t just sit on your face, they announce your arrival. The moment you put them on, it’s like stepping into a whole new version of yourself. The bolder side of your personality, the fearless yet mysterious one. The red speaks like-” I know something you don’t.”



I remember the first time I tried a pair of deep red acetate frames suggested by my friend. The moment I looked in the mirror, there was a drift of instant confidence. I felt like an effortlessly cool person who walked into a room and got noticed without even trying.



These glasses hold the power to spell magic to your outfit and radiate a powerful look. The best part is you can simply throw them on with something casual. Like your everyday college outfit or with your interesting person at the coffee shop look. With these pairs of accessories, there is no effort needed.



And let’s talk about options. There are the dramatic oversized red frames that scream fashion week energy, the thin steel ones for a sleek, sophisticated edge, and even transparent red for that modern, artsy vibe. If you’re looking to experiment, Specscart has a bunch of cool shapes and materials whether you want that vintage round frame mystery or sharp-edged, power-player energy. In fact, if you want to customise them into [prescription glasses](https://specscart.co.uk/glasses), this is also possible. They give free prescription lenses with anti-glare, anti-UV, anti-scratch, and impact-resistant coatings with any frame you purchase.



But really, red glasses aren’t just an accessory, they’re a personality shift. You put them on, and suddenly, you’re the main character.

I have a Sage Barista Express and me and my wife love it as it’s very easy to use for what it does. We sometimes drink coffee together and sometimes solo, so we often switch between single and double basket.

So I’ve been eyeing a bottomless portafilter to have a dedicated basket for a single shot, but after giving a single basket another look, I’m not sure it would make sense since it has a limited central extraction.

Now if I use bottomless portafilter for a double basket, it means I have to pull double shot each time?

How do you actually use bottomless portafilter on this Sage?

This is my first coffee machine so I’m not too familiar with baskets/solutions. I was looking at original Sage naked portafilter 54 mm.

1jmgqun,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jmgqun/the_dollmaker/,The Dollmaker,"The coastal fog had swallowed Harborview whole by the time Claire Martin's car crossed the town limits. Her headlights carved weak tunnels through the dense mist as she navigated streets that felt both familiar and foreign after fifteen years away.

Her phone buzzed with a text from Sheriff Thomas Reeves: *Body found. Town square garden. It's bad, Claire.*

""Shit,"" she muttered, changing direction toward the center of town.

She'd returned to Harborview two days ago when eight-year-old Emily Preston disappeared from the harvest fair. Not because small-town police couldn't handle a missing child case, but because something about it had pulled at a thread inside her that had been loose for fifteen years. The same thread that had unraveled when her nine-year-old sister Olivia vanished without a trace.

Claire parked behind the police barricade and stepped into the fog. Thomas stood in the garden, his broad shoulders hunched against the cold. The years had added lines around his eyes and silver to his temples, but his posture was exactly as she remembered from high school.

""Thanks for coming,"" he said, his voice gruff. ""Fair warning, this is nothing like anything we've seen before.""

He led her around a hedge to a small clearing. In front of a stone birdbath, posed in a perfect arabesque, stood what Claire first mistook for a child's mannequin. Until she got closer.

Emily Preston's body balanced on one leg, the other extended behind her, arms gracefully curved above her head. She wore her harvest fair dress, but her skin had been painted stark porcelain white. Her eyes had been removed and replaced with glass replicas, blue and shining in the beam of police flashlights.

""What the hell?"" Claire whispered, crouching beside the body.

""That's not even the worst part,"" Thomas said.

""The child's organs have been removed"" explained Dr. Eliza Morgan, the county medical examiner. ""The cavity has been packed with straw, sawdust, and fabric scraps.""

""Like a doll,"" Claire said.

Claire circled the body slowly. ""Any message from the killer?""

Thomas pointed to the birdbath. Crude letters were carved into the stone: *She dances forever now.*

Claire noticed something glinting in the grass beneath the birdbath: a shard of porcelain, curved like a piece of broken doll's face.

---

The Prestons sat in Thomas's office, James hunched forward while Linda stared straight ahead, her posture rigid.

""Mr. and Mrs. Preston,"" Claire began gently, ""I need to ask you some questions.""

""Was she... did she suffer?"" James asked, his voice cracking.

""We're still determining that,"" Claire said carefully.

""Who would do this to a little girl?"" James asked, his voice rising. ""Who the fuck could do something like this?""

""Did Emily have any particular interest in dolls?"" Claire asked.

Linda's eyes snapped to Claire's. ""Why would you ask that?""

""The positioning of her body,"" Claire explained. ""It was... deliberate. Like a posed doll.""

""She loved ballet,"" Linda said. ""She was taking lessons.""

""Were there any adults who took a special interest in Emily?""

Linda shifted slightly. ""There was that old woman at the fair. The one with the herb shop. She kept watching Emily, tried to give her some kind of charm bracelet.""

""Miriam Wilson?"" Thomas asked.

Linda nodded. ""Emily said the woman told her it would 'keep the shadows away.'""

""One last question,"" Claire said. ""Was anything missing from Emily's room after she disappeared?""

""Her ballerina music box,"" Linda said. ""I didn't notice until now, but it's gone.""

---

Miriam Wilson's shop smelled of dried herbs and something sharper. Candles flickered in the windows despite the morning hour.

""You're the detective,"" she said when Claire entered. ""The one who lost her sister.""

Claire stiffened. ""How did you know about my sister?""

""Everyone knows everyone's business in Harborview. Especially the tragic stories.""

""I'm here about Emily Preston.""

""The first doll,"" Miriam said.

Claire's hand instinctively moved toward her holstered gun. ""What did you just say?""

""You heard me. She won't be the last. It's starting again.""

""What's starting again?""

""Sit down, Detective. The shadows were already gathering around her.""

""What shadows?""

Miriam set a mug of tea on the counter. ""The ones that wear familiar faces. The Dollmaker doesn't have a face of its own. It wears ours.""

""The Dollmaker?""

""That's what it's been called for over a hundred years. Since William Baker lost his daughter and tried to bring her back.""

""Tell me about William Baker.""

""He was a toymaker. Made beautiful dolls. When his daughter died of fever, he went mad with grief. Started making dolls that looked exactly like her. Then children started disappearing. When they were found, they'd been turned into life-sized dolls.""

""That's just a story.""

""Check the town records from 1872,"" Miriam said. ""Then tell me it's just a story.""

""It'll come for another child soon,"" she continued. ""And when it does, look to those closest to your heart. The shadow hides in grief."" She fixed Claire with an intense stare. ""Your sister—you never found her, did you?""

Claire left without answering. Outside, the fog had thickened. For a moment, she thought she saw a small figure watching her from across the street—a child with long dark hair like Olivia's—but when she blinked, there was nothing there.

---

In the town archive, Claire found a series of articles from 1872 about missing children. Three children had disappeared, and their bodies were later discovered ""altered in a grotesque manner, resembling oversized dolls."" The final article mentioned the toymaker's workshop burning down, with ""dozens of dolls, all bearing a striking resemblance to Baker's deceased daughter"" found in the ruins.

Claire photographed the articles and headed back to the station, where Thomas showed her another porcelain fragment found at the garden.

""This isn't new,"" she said. ""Look at the weathering. This has been in the ground for years.""

Her phone buzzed with a text: *Another girl missing. Sophia Baker, age 7. Last seen walking home from school.*

""Fuck,"" she whispered. ""It's happening again.""

---

Claire stood in seven-year-old Sophia Baker's bedroom, taking in the rows of dolls that lined the shelves. Antique porcelain dolls with painted faces and glassy eyes stared back at her.

""She collects them,"" Mrs. Baker explained. ""Her grandmother started giving them to her when she was three.""

""When did you notice she was missing?""

""She should have been home from school by four. It's only three blocks. Everyone knows everyone here.""

Except someone in Harborview was taking children, and no one knew who it was.

Outside, Thomas was organizing search parties. Mayor Gregory Walsh arrived, putting pressure on them to solve the case quickly, more concerned about the town's tourism than the children.

""We're exploring several angles,"" Claire told him vaguely.

""Well, explore them faster,"" Walsh said. ""The fall festival season is our economic lifeblood.""

""With all due respect, Mr. Mayor,"" Claire interrupted, ""two children are missing or dead. The festival season shouldn't be our priority.""

While reviewing security footage around Sophia's disappearance, Officer Reynolds discovered something disturbing on the gas station camera.

""There,"" he said, pointing at the screen. ""At 3:51.""

The angle captured Sophia stopping at the corner of Pine and Main to speak with someone. The child nodded, then followed the person down Pine Street.

Reynolds pulled up additional footage from a hardware store camera with a better angle. Claire could see Sophia walking hand-in-hand with a woman down Pine Street—a woman with Claire's build, hair, and jacket.

When Reynolds enhanced the image, Claire felt the blood drain from her face.

""What the fuck?"" she whispered. ""That's not possible. I was here at 3:51 yesterday.""

Thomas stared at the screen, then at Claire. ""That's... that can't be you.""

""I was with you,"" Claire insisted.

*The shadows wear familiar faces.* Miriam Wilson's words echoed in her mind.

""I need to speak with Miriam Wilson again,"" Claire said.

---

The herb shop was closed, a hand-written ""Back Soon"" sign hanging in the window. Claire found the door unlocked.

""Miriam?"" she called, stepping inside. The shop was dark, the candles unlit.

A soft thump came from the back room. Claire drew her weapon and pushed aside the beaded curtain.

On the floor near the window, Miriam Wilson lay on her back, arms wrapped around a large porcelain doll. Her eye sockets were empty, bloody hollows.

The doll in Miriam's arms had a painted china face, its blue glass eyes eerily similar to those placed in Emily Preston's sockets.

Claire called it in, then searched the room. On a small desk, she found a journal open to a page filled with Miriam's handwriting:

*It's happening again. The Dollmaker has returned. I tried to warn her, but she doesn't understand yet. It hides in grief, wears the skin of those who've lost the most. The toys are the key—it always takes a toy first, then the child.*

""We found fibers on her clothing,"" Dr. Morgan told Claire later. ""Dark wool, consistent with your jacket, Detective Martin.""

Claire stared at her. ""I never touched her.""

The thought came unbidden: *What if I did it and don't remember?*

---

That night, Claire dreamed of Olivia. They were in their childhood bedroom, surrounded by Olivia's doll collection. In the dream, Olivia's face was porcelain-white, her eyes glass.

""You let him take me,"" dream-Olivia said, her voice unnatural. ""Now he's taking them all.""

Claire woke gasping, dawn light filtering through her motel room curtains. For a moment, she thought she saw a small figure standing in the corner of the room, but when she turned on the lamp, nothing was there.

She showered and dressed quickly, determined to find answers. At the town's historical society, she discovered disturbing details about William Baker that hadn't made it into the newspapers.

Baker's daughter, Elizabeth, had died of scarlet fever in 1871. Consumed by grief, he'd discovered an ancient ritual in a book of occult practices that promised to preserve a soul. His journals described how grief itself could become a conduit—""the hollowness inside me calls to something older than time.""

Baker had written about ""finding a way to house Elizabeth's spirit in a perfect vessel"" by transferring innocence from one child to another. He believed the eyes were crucial—""windows through which the soul might return.""

Her phone rang. It was Thomas. ""They found Sophia Baker.""

---

The second ""doll"" was discovered in the old cemetery, posed kneeling beside a weathered gravestone. Like Emily, Sophia had been transformed—her skin painted white, glass eyes inserted, organs removed and replaced with stuffing. Her hair had been replaced with yellow yarn, and a fixed smile painted on her lips.

Carved into the gravestone were the words: *Mother and child reunited at last.*

""The grave belongs to Elizabeth Baker and her mother,"" Officer Reynolds told Claire.

As the crime scene unit worked, Claire noticed Mayor Walsh watching from behind the police tape. ""This is getting out of hand, Detective,"" he said. ""People are talking about leaving town until the killer is caught.""

""I'm doing everything I can,"" Claire replied.

""Are you? Because from what I hear, you're chasing ghost stories.""

As he walked away, Claire noticed something glinting in the grass: another porcelain fragment, similar to those found with Emily.

""Thomas,"" she called. ""These fragments are being left deliberately.""

""Claire, you need to be careful,"" he warned. ""People are starting to talk. About you. The video, the fibers on Miriam's body. Mayor Walsh has been asking questions about your whereabouts.""

---

William Baker's land lay on the outskirts of town. The workshop had burned down in 1872, but a small cottage on the property had survived.

Reynolds parked at the end of a dirt track, and they continued on foot through dense underbrush. The cottage, when they found it, was little more than a stone foundation and crumbling walls.

In what had once been the cellar, Claire found a trapdoor hidden beneath years of dirt and debris. The space below was small but intact. Shelves lined the walls, holding dozens of porcelain doll parts—heads, limbs, torsos. In the center stood a workbench covered in dust.

Claire approached the bench carefully. On it lay an ancient, leather-bound book and a wooden box containing locks of hair, baby teeth, tiny fingernail clippings. Mementos of Elizabeth Baker, preserved by her grieving father.

The book contained technical notes on doll-making, but toward the back, the writing changed:

*I have found the way to bring her back. The ancient text speaks of a spirit that can move between vessels, seeking the warmth of the living. It requires a sacrifice—grief for grief, child for child. I have made my offering. Soon Elizabeth will dance again.*

""Detective,"" Reynolds called from across the room. ""You need to see this.""

He was standing before a wooden cabinet. When Claire joined him, she saw a small porcelain doll dressed in a blue dress identical to the one Olivia had been wearing when she disappeared fifteen years ago.

Claire reached for the doll, but as her fingers touched it, a stabbing pain shot through her head. The room spun, and for a moment, she thought she saw a small girl standing in the corner—not Olivia, but Elizabeth Baker, her face cracked porcelain, her eyes empty sockets.

*You're next*, a voice whispered in her mind. *You've always been mine.*

Then darkness claimed her.

---

Claire woke in a hospital bed, Thomas sitting beside her.

""What happened?"" she asked, her throat dry.

""You collapsed in Baker's cellar,"" he said. ""Reynolds called an ambulance. You've been unconscious for six hours.""

""The doll, the journal—""

""Evidence techs have collected everything,"" Thomas assured her. ""But Claire, we need to talk.""

He held up his phone, showing her a video clip. The footage showed Claire entering Sophia Baker's house through a back window, then leaving thirty minutes later.

""That's not possible,"" Claire whispered. ""I was with you.""

""Not the whole time,"" Thomas said gently. ""You left to get coffee, remember? There's a twenty-minute gap I can't account for.""

""We found Sophia's ballerina music box in your motel room,"" he continued. ""And Emily Preston's music box too.""

""Someone planted them."" Claire's mind raced. ""Someone's framing me.""

""Or you're having blackouts,"" Thomas suggested. ""Maybe related to the trauma of your sister's disappearance.""

""You think I'm killing these children? Turning them into dolls? Jesus, Thomas!""

""I don't want to believe it,"" he said. ""But the evidence...""

""Fuck the evidence! Something is happening in this town, something that's happened before. The same thing that took Olivia.""

Thomas stood, his expression pained. ""I've asked Dr. Morgan to do a psychological evaluation. Until then, I'm placing you under observation.""

As he left, Claire noticed her reflection in the darkened window beside her bed. For a split second, she thought she saw someone else looking back—a face like hers, but with glassy, lifeless eyes.

---

Three days under ""observation"" had frayed Claire's nerves to breaking point. An officer was stationed outside her hospital room at all times, and she wasn't permitted to leave.

Officer Reynolds visited daily, smuggling in case files and updates. It was Reynolds who told her they'd found William Baker's journal in her motel room—a journal she'd never taken from the cellar.

""Someone's setting you up,"" he whispered. ""But why?""

""Because I'm getting too close to the truth,"" Claire said. ""Reynolds, I need your help. I need to see the dolls from Baker's cellar.""

He returned that evening with a flash drive. ""Photos of everything,"" he said. ""And I found something strange on one of the doll heads.""

He pulled up an image on his tablet. It showed a porcelain doll head with a jagged crack across its face—identical to the fragments found at both crime scenes.

""The lab confirmed it,"" Reynolds said. ""The pieces you found came from this doll. But the break patterns show the pieces were broken off recently, not 150 years ago.""

""Someone has access to Baker's original dolls,"" Claire murmured.

""There's something else."" Reynolds swiped to another image: a doll with Olivia's face, identical down to the small mole near her left eyebrow.

Claire felt her heart stop. ""That's my sister.""

""I know. The resemblance is uncanny.""

""Not resemblance,"" Claire corrected, her voice hollow. ""It is her. Someone made that doll to look exactly like Olivia.""

""What if your sister wasn't the first? What if whatever's happening now was happening then too?""

""I need to get out of here,"" Claire said suddenly. ""Tonight.""

---

The storm hit Harborview just after 11 PM, sheets of rain lashing the hospital windows as lightning split the sky. By midnight, when Reynolds triggered the fire alarm in another wing, the storm had reached its peak.

Claire slipped out during the chaos, using the emergency exit Reynolds had left unlocked. Her first stop was her motel room, where she retrieved her gun and notes from a hidden go-bag.

As lightning illuminated the room, Claire caught a glimpse of a small figure reflected in the mirror. When she looked back, for a split second she saw herself with porcelain-white skin and glass eyes before the image returned to normal.

Her next destination was Baker's cellar. The storm had made the dirt track to the property almost impassable. Claire abandoned the car halfway and continued on foot, rain plastering her hair to her face.

The cellar entrance stood open, crime scene tape fluttering in the wind. Claire descended the stairs, her flashlight beam cutting through the darkness. Evidence markers still dotted the space, but most items had been removed.

What remained were the dolls deemed irrelevant to the case—dozens of them, staring with glass eyes from shelves and tabletops. Claire searched until she found it—a small porcelain doll with auburn hair. Olivia's hair. Claire reached for it with trembling hands.

The moment her fingers touched the cool porcelain, pain lanced through her head. Images flashed before her eyes: Olivia walking into these woods fifteen years ago, following a figure that looked like Claire; Olivia lying on the workbench, her eyes removed; Olivia's body transformed into a doll.

Claire gasped, dropping the doll. It shattered on the stone floor, the head breaking into pieces. From within the broken porcelain, something rolled out. Claire picked it up and nearly retched.

It was a child's eye, preserved somehow, the iris still a recognizable hazel. Olivia's eye.

""No,"" Claire moaned, falling to her knees. ""No, no, no.""

The eye should have decomposed years ago, yet it remained intact—preserved by whatever dark magic had transformed her sister. Baker's journal had mentioned ""windows to the soul"" being essential to the ritual. The entity needed these eyes as anchors, tethering it to our world through stolen innocence.

""You weren't supposed to find that yet.""

Claire's head snapped up. In the doorway stood Linda Preston, her clothes drenched from the rain, her eyes reflecting the beam of Claire's dropped flashlight.

""Linda?"" Claire scrambled to her feet, reaching for her gun. ""What are you doing here?""

""The same thing you are,"" Linda said, her voice oddly calm. ""Looking for answers.""

""Did you follow me?""

Linda smiled, but the expression didn't reach her eyes. ""I've been following you since you arrived in Harborview, Claire. Or should I say, I've been following myself?""

Claire's finger tensed on the trigger. ""What are you talking about?""

Linda's form seemed to shimmer in the flashlight beam. ""I've worn many faces over the years. The grieving mother. The concerned teacher. The detective haunted by her past."" Her smile widened unnaturally. ""I know how to use grief. How to wear it like a second skin.""

Understanding dawned, cold and terrible. ""You're the Dollmaker.""

""Not exactly,"" Linda said, stepping closer. ""The Dollmaker was William Baker. I am what he invited in. The entity that granted his wish to preserve his daughter forever. And I've been collecting perfect vessels ever since.""

""The children,"" Claire whispered. ""You've been taking them for 150 years.""

""Not continuously. I sleep between cycles, awakening when grief calls to me. Your grief called very loudly, Claire Martin.""

""Why children?"" Claire's gun hand trembled slightly. ""Why not just take adults?""

""Children are... purer vessels. Their innocence makes them perfect for transformation."" Linda's head tilted at an unnatural angle. ""Adults I merely borrow, like poor Linda here. But only the most profound grief creates enough hollow space for me to enter. Grief for a child works best—it carves out the perfect void.""

Claire raised her gun. ""Stay back.""

Linda laughed, the sound echoing unnaturally in the cellar. ""You can't shoot me without shooting Linda Preston. And she's innocent in all this. Just another vessel, like you've been.""

""What do you mean, like I've been?""

""Why do you think there's footage of you taking Sophia? Why your fingerprints were on Miriam's body? I've been wearing your skin since you arrived, slipping in and out while you sleep.""

Claire felt sick. ""You took Olivia. You made me think I'd failed to protect her.""

""I made you perfect,"" Linda corrected. ""Grief-hollowed and ready to house me. I've been patient, waiting for you to return. And now the cycle is nearly complete.""

Lightning flashed, illuminating Linda's face. For a moment, her features seemed to melt, revealing something else beneath—a porcelain mask over empty darkness.

Claire fired. The bullet struck Linda in the shoulder, spinning her around. She stumbled but didn't fall, and when she turned back, her expression had changed completely.

""Claire?"" Linda's voice was different now—confused, frightened. ""What's happening? Why am I here? Oh God, you shot me!""

Claire hesitated, her gun still raised. ""Linda, listen to me. Something is using you, controlling you. You need to fight it.""

Linda pressed her hand to her bleeding shoulder, her eyes wide with pain and confusion. ""I don't understand. The last thing I remember is being at home with James. Then... nothing.""

""The entity that's been taking children—it's possessing you. It's been possessing me too.""

Thunder crashed overhead, and Linda's body convulsed. When she looked up again, her eyes had changed—flat and glassy.

""Poor Linda,"" the thing wearing her face said. ""Her grief made her such an easy vessel. Just like your grief made you easy.""

It lunged suddenly, inhumanly fast. Claire fired again, but the bullet seemed to have no effect. Cold hands closed around her throat, driving her backward into the shelves. Dolls crashed down around them as Claire struggled for breath.

""I'm going to wear you forever,"" the entity hissed. ""Your guilt over Olivia makes you perfect.""

Through darkening vision, Claire saw the truth—her guilt had been feeding this thing for fifteen years. Her grief over Olivia had created the opening it needed.

With her remaining strength, Claire reached for the fallen flashlight and swung it hard against Linda's head. The woman crumpled, and Claire gasped for air.

Claire's gaze fell on Baker's ritual components and journal pages describing how the binding might be undone: *The binding requires grief; the unbinding requires acceptance.*

Linda stirred, her body moving jerkily as she rose to her feet. Blood streamed from the wound in her shoulder, but she seemed not to notice it.

""You can't fight me,"" the entity said through Linda's mouth. ""I am grief incarnate.""

""I know,"" Claire said, backing toward the workbench. ""And I've carried my grief for too long.""

She grabbed the candles from Baker's box, lighting them quickly. The storm howled above as Claire arranged the candles in a circle around herself.

""What are you doing?"" the entity demanded.

""Letting go,"" Claire said.

She closed her eyes, forcing herself to face the memory she'd been running from for fifteen years: Olivia walking into the woods, following a figure that looked like Claire; Claire, fifteen years old, frozen in terror, unable to call out or follow.

""I'm sorry, Olivia,"" she whispered. ""I was just a kid. I couldn't have saved you.""

The entity shrieked, a sound like breaking glass. ""Stop!""

Claire continued, tears streaming down her face. ""I forgive myself. I release my guilt.""

Linda's body convulsed, her back arching unnaturally. Something seemed to be trying to escape from inside her—a shadowy form pulling away from her human shape.

""I accept what happened,"" Claire said, her voice stronger now. ""I couldn't save you then, but I can stop this now.""

The entity tore free from Linda, who collapsed to the ground, unconscious but breathing. For a moment, it hung in the air—a shifting darkness with the suggestion of a porcelain face, its empty eye sockets fixed on Claire.

""You can't unmake what's been done,"" it hissed. ""The dolls remain.""

""But they don't control me anymore,"" Claire replied. ""And I understand what you are now—not a demon or ghost, but grief itself given form. Fed by our pain until you became real.""

The entity rippled, its darkness thinning. ""Each eye I take sees only me. Each heart I empty fills with me. This cycle will continue as long as there is loss.""

She picked up a fragment of the broken doll that had contained Olivia's eye. With steady hands, she placed it in the center of the candle circle and set it alight.

The entity screamed, its form rippling as flames consumed the porcelain. Cracks appeared across its face-like surface, spreading rapidly. Light blazed from within the fractures, growing brighter until Claire had to shield her eyes.

When she looked again, the entity was gone. The dolls on the remaining shelves had crumbled to dust, and Linda Preston lay unconscious but alive.

Outside, the storm had passed.

---

One week later, Claire stood in the town cemetery. Two small graves had been added—Emily Preston and Sophia Baker—but Claire's attention was on the newest memorial: a small stone for Olivia Martin, finally laid to rest.

Thomas joined her, his face solemn. ""The ME confirmed that the eye belonged to your sister. I'm sorry, Claire.""

""What will happen to Linda?"" Claire asked.

""Psychiatric evaluation. But she's not being charged. The evidence shows she was... not herself.""

""None of this will make it into the official report, you know. About the entity, Baker's ritual. Some stories are better left untold.""

""But remembered,"" Claire insisted. ""So it doesn't happen again.""

""Do you think it's really gone?""

Claire thought of the entity's final words: *There will always be dolls.* ""I don't know. But I think our grief gave it power. By facing that grief, we weaken it.""

They stood in silence for a moment before Thomas spoke again. ""Are you sure you won't stay? The department could use someone like you.""

Claire shook her head. ""There are other missing children, other cases to solve. But I'll visit.""

As Thomas walked back to his cruiser, Claire knelt to place flowers on Olivia's memorial. For the first time in fifteen years, when she thought of her sister, she remembered her smile rather than her absence.

---

In a city two hundred miles away, a young girl browsed a flea market with her mother. At a table of antique toys, something caught her eye—a porcelain doll with a painted face and glass eyes.

""Can I have this one, Mom? Please?""

""I don't know, honey. It looks old and kind of creepy.""

The girl picked it up anyway, cradling it in her arms. As her mother turned to examine another table, the doll's eyes slowly blinked.

""Don't worry,"" the girl whispered to the doll. ""I'll take you home.”",2,1743231939.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False
1jmgpyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Prostatitis/comments/1jmgpyw/my_prostatitis_cpps_story_will_update/,"My Prostatitis/ CPPS story, will update","
Background of my issues:

In the past, I had both UTI and STD. I still get UTI symptoms once or twice a year, for example, when I leave on wet swimwear at the seaside. Antibiotics have always worked in these cases, sometimes it even went away on its own or with homeopatics.

I also had an STD in 2018—chlamydia and ureaplasma (from anal sex). Antibiotics resolved it, but it took a longer time. At that time, I also had surgery on my perineum—removal of a hematoma, which I probably got from combat sports. I also found out I have HSV2. But since then, everything was more or less fine, until january 2025.

I have a sedentary job—basically, I didn’t walk much since Covid, worked from home, and only swam twice a week for 20 minutes. Most of the time, I was either sitting at my PC or lying on the couch playing games or watching TV. I only walked occasionally on weekends. My posture was poor, and I sat incorrectly. I was also often anxious, fearful and mild OCD.

I also used to have problems with my back, lumbar and lumbar-thoracic, resolved by rehab and TENS.

My symptoms:

- Occasionally, I noticed clear mucus after urinating in the morning, at the end of the stream—I didn’t think much of it. 

- I started finding large stains of urine in my boxers after urinating. It suddenly became hard to expel urine after peeing. Previously, I used to kegel once and then manually “milk” the last drops by pressing under the scrotum, but suddenly, this didn’t work well anymore. Urine remained inside, and I had and still have to milk it out drop by drop to avoid stains. 

- Then, I also started having burning during and after urination and sometimes randomly, with varying intensity + discomfort That’s when I went to the doctor.

The general practitioner did a dipstick test, which was positive, so he prescribed five days of nitrofurantoin blindly. After finishing the antibiotics, the problem was not resolved. He then prescribed seven days of Augmentin and performed a urine culture, which came back negative, along with another dipstick test and CRP test (also negative). Then, he prescribed five days of doxycycline, which didn’t work either, though symptoms slightly improved but were not resolved.

I then went to a urologist, who prescribed five days of azithromycin just to be sure, but there was no improvement. He performed an STD swab test, which was negative. He did a uroflowmetry test, which was normal. He performed cystoscopy, which was normal except for mild hyperemia of the bulbar urethra. A bladder ultrasound was normal. A prostate exam (finger in anal) was normal, with no pain. I have slightly larger prostate - 25g adenoma. He ordered another urine culture and STD swab, both of which were negative. Blood tests were also negative.

I then went to an STD clinic, where they did a PCR test for HSV and additional STD tests, all of which were negative as well. 

The urologists say everything looks fine from a urological standpoint and don’t know what else to test. Both urologists suggest the issue might be coming from my lumbar spine, so I ruled out infection.

I took various supplements, including cranberry, D-mannose, Chinese herbs, urological teas, and homeopathy, but nothing helped. Symptoms remain the same. 
I have no pain at all, only urinary symptoms. I tried resting at home, but it didn’t help. I tried running and intense exercise, but it caused flares. Now for the past week, I have been following a strict routine: walking every day, pelvic therapy stretching, belly breathing, meditation, and avoiding coffee and alcohol, which I found in the 101 and various success stories in this reddit.

I’m doing these PT stretches:

Twice a day:

Once a day:
https://youtu.be/J6tueuGlo1Q?si=3NY1zxnywoO4ZkwZ


Am I on the right path? Does this sound like CPPS, even if I only have urinary symptoms? I found some trigger points, but only in the upper gluteal area—at the junction of the glutes and lumbar spine going from my ass crack all the way to my flank, on both sides. Could this be relevant?

I’m also starting psychotherapy next week and rehab (although it is a group rehab, so not strictly PT) + TENS on the lumbar area.

I will update if any progress, so far the symptoms are still the same and I’m really worried.",2,1743231830.0,Prostatitis,0,1.0,False

1jmgn43,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jmgn43/the_invitation/,The Invitation,"I never thought I'd be the kind of person to fall for something like this. But there I was, alone, confused, and staring down a reality I never thought possible.

It started on a cold autumn evening, colourful leaves falling down on the pavement. I was walking home from the coffee shop, headphones in, listening to my favourite artists, as usual. I didn’t expect anything out of the ordinary that could occur. But that night, the usual sounds of the neighbourhood seemed muffled, almost as if something was pressing down on the air, suffocating the usual bustle of life. It was like all the life had been sucked out of the air by some unthinkable force,

My phone buzzed in my pocket, pulling me out of my trance. It was an unknown number.

“Hey, I saw you at the coffee shop today. I’m right around the corner. I think we’d have a lot to talk about.”

At first, I thought it was surely a stupid prank. Maybe some weird friend of mine was messing around. But the number felt… unfamiliar. I paused, my thumb hovering over the screen, unsure. Should I respond? Why was this person watching me? What did they want?

Before I could make a decision, another text came in: “I know this seems strange, but I’m just looking for some company. You can see me from where you are right now.”

I froze. My eyes darted to the street ahead of me, but I couldn’t see anyone. The hair on the back of my neck prickled, and I quickly typed back a short, sharp response: “Who is this?”

The reply was almost immediate: “You’ll see soon enough. I’m waiting for you.”

I tried to shrug off the feeling creeping up my spine. Maybe it was just some lonely person looking for attention. Maybe it was one of those weird dating scams that pop up every now and then. But I couldn’t shake the sensation that I was being watched.

Then I saw him.

A figure standing under the flickering streetlight. Tall, with dark hair falling in soft waves around his face. His eyes… I couldn’t make them out at first, just two deep, black pools staring at me. And his smile—so perfect, so mesmerizing.

I stopped dead in my tracks, my heart thumping loudly in my chest. Something about him felt wrong, yet… I couldn’t look away.

He took a step closer, his movements graceful, almost ethereal. My mouth went dry.

“You must be Jessica,” he said, his voice deep and smooth, like velvet.

I didn’t know what to say. It was impossible—this was all impossible.

“Who are you?” I managed to whisper.

He smiled wider. “I’m someone who has been looking for you for a long time.”

I backed away instinctively, my feet moving before my mind had time to process. But he was quicker, almost impossibly so. He was in front of me, blocking my way, before I could take two steps.

“You don’t need to be afraid,” he murmured, his lips just inches from my ear. “I won’t hurt you… not yet.”

My pulse skyrocketed. Every cell in my body screamed at me to run, but my feet were frozen to the ground, my limbs stiff with fear.

“I didn’t mean to frighten you,” he continued, his breath cool against my skin, his touch impossibly icy and rock-hard. “But you’ve been so… interesting to watch.”

His hand grazed my cheek, and I flinched back. He chuckled softly, eyes never leaving mine.

“You’re wondering why you feel this way, aren’t you?” he asked, his voice almost a purr. “Why you can’t look away. Why your heart races, and you feel like you’re being pulled in.”

I nodded without meaning to.

“That’s because I’m not just anyone,” he said, his smile turning from charming to predatory. “I’m something more. And you… you are going to be mine.”

He stepped back, and for a moment, I thought I could escape, but then he spoke again.

“You don’t need to run. You can’t escape what you already are.”

I tried to shake my head, but his words seemed to cling to my thoughts, making them heavier, darker.

“Just let me in,” he whispered. “Invite me in. I won’t force you… but if you do, I promise it’ll be worth it.”

His voice was honey-sweet, and before I knew what I was doing, I said the words I never thought I’d say: “Come in.”

His eyes gleamed with victory as he stepped across the threshold, into my personal space. He wasn’t a stranger anymore—he was too familiar, too close. He didn’t even need to touch me to make my skin crawl with electricity.

The moment he crossed that line, something shifted. He was suddenly right next to me again, his lips brushing my ear as he murmured, “You’ve made a terrible mistake, my dear.”

I felt my heart slow, my vision blur, and something within me twisted with a hunger I couldn't place. His smile widened, revealing sharp, gleaming fangs.

But instead of immediately attacking me, he toyed with me. He circled me, his presence overwhelming, filling the room with an intoxicating scent I couldn’t identify. He spoke in soft, coaxing words, keeping me just on the edge of madness. His voice slid into my mind, planting thoughts I didn’t want to have, thoughts of him, of us, together.

I felt myself becoming weaker, more vulnerable with every passing minute, unable to escape the web he was weaving around me.

Eventually, I could no longer tell where he ended and I began. The darkness he offered was becoming my own.

Just when I thought I might pass out, his fangs sank into my neck.

The pain was blinding at first, and then there was nothing. No pain. No fear. Just a cold, consuming stillness.

And then, there was power.

I collapsed into his arms, my body trembling as the transformation took hold. He didn’t need to say anything. The change was already happening, deep inside of me.

""You’re mine now,"" he said, his voice full of dark triumph.

I could feel it—the thirst. The need. The hunger.

And now, I understand. You’re probably wondering why you’re reading this, aren’t you? You’re curious, maybe even skeptical. But you know something’s off. And that’s why I’m telling you this now.

The moment you finish reading this, the curse will be on you.

You’ll be stalked by someone just like him—a handsome, dangerous creature, who will lure you in. You’ll be tempted to invite them in, just like I did.

And then, like me, you will belong to them.

At the time he needed help with his university assignments, so used to come over and I'd help him out. Later he met a girl and I gave him advice on that as well. Then they broke up and he needed a lot of support, so he started coming over pretty much few times a week and we'd talk about psychology and philosophy of dating. Over the years we became ""friends"", and I put that in quotation marks as it feels one sided. 

Don't get me wrong, I have no problem providing support. If I have something, I am happy to share. 

Today, this person told me that he was dumped by his gf, so I took him out for coffee. 

I think its important to note that he is young, arrogant, hot headed, lacks self awareness, and always thinks with his second head. I have mentioned it to him that he needs to work on himself. 

It is no surprise that his ex dumped him, he wasn't treating her well, and I did mention it to him on numerous occasions, and also that he should do things differently. But he being him, never listened and always said ""I'm perfect, I treat her perfectly"" and things as such. 

For our coffee meet up we went to a Cafe that I used to frequent a lot. The place closed a few weeks ago, and reopened yesterday with new owners. And I wanted to see meet the new owners as well. 

Turns out the new owners are friends of a friend of mine, they have recently moved to the neigh or hood, and coincidentally on my street, and the owners daughter (F23) is the headchef. Immediately this ""friend"" starts asking the owner if the daughter is single, if he can meet her. On the way back, he tells me ""don't make a move on the daughter, I want to date her. You can take the mum""

That really pissed me off. First off, im not interested in either of them. Second, he just got dumped yesterday, has mistreated his past two gas, and has a lot of baggage. So I just lashed out and told him he can't do what he did to the other two girls to this one too. We had a big argument about it. But he is adamant and said he will frequent the restaurant and do whatever he can to get the girl. And for some reason I feel responsible, although its none of my business, I feel like I should tell someone what a knobhead this kid is.

For the most part, hes such a great cat. But im having a hard time constantly trying to teach him ""NO"". As an example, everyday, multiple times a day, he tries to jump into the dishwasher when I open it. Im constantly raising my voice to say ""AH! AH!, NO!"" and I gently push him away/back down. He will try again atleast 3-5 times before he gives up and walks away. Then a few hours later the cycle will reset and he will try another 3-5 times like its his first time again. Ive tried lifting him and putting him outside the kitchen for ""timeout"" as soon as he jumps up. But he still doesnt learn. Ive tried clapping really loud, 99% of the time this works and he will back down. But he will continue to keep trying multiple times afterwards. I know a lot of people advise against it, but ive even sprayed him with a misting water bottle once or twice as a last resort and he runs for the hills. But again, later in the day its like hes forgotten and will try to jump up. I know the easy answer might be to close the kitchen door, but im in and out 100 times a day and its a pain to keep closing it and opening it. 

Its not just the dishwasher, its also the coffee table in the living room, its the fridge whenever we open it, its the leather dining chairs (hes damaged these with his claws by jumping up). We keep the dining room closed 24/7 now. We covered the coffee table for about 2 weeks with tinfoil and he quickly learnt not to go near it. As soon as we lifted it off, you guessed it, hes trying to jump up on it again. 

Its been like this Every. Single. Day. For the past 3+ months. Has anyone had success in a similar situation? Is there anything Im doing wrong? Is he just a bad cat? Theres literally 0 progress.

So the other day, I’m getting ready to head out to work, I already know my first meetings of the day have been cancelled but when checking my schedule one more time I see that the office space I am usually allocated to for the whole day has been reallocated to someone else for a chunk of the morning. Not a big deal as such, but as I have a very long commute to work (no car, only public transport), I usually always arrive very early, grab some food to eat for breakfast and lunch on the way, and a very mandatory milk tea, (without which, by the time I hit the afternoon my head will equally hitting the table with all masking mechanisms completely on afternoon hiatus) and then quietly set up, do my work and take care of all my meetings.

With my usual place to set up early, get some other work done etc, suddenly off the table, in that exact moment it’s like I suddenly have a tsunami wave of options and endless potential consequences hitting my neuro-waves, all at once. Like suddenly finding myself in a cackle of noisy kindergarten kids each pulling at me and clambering with questions and suggestions and wanting me to give them attention right this instant. The stupidity is exhausting, ranging from, ‘oh you got some really nice bread in yesterday and cheese and tomatoes so why not slice up a couple yummy sandwiches’ backing straight onto ‘oh but you’re out of mayo and nothing tastes more like eating the Sahara desert than sandwiches with no mayo, plus the tomatoes will go soggy and gross by the time I get to eat… oh and then where will I put them, will they get squashed – containers are heavy and need washing – oh oh oh and look who is forgetting – what about all the CRUMBS!!! There will be crumbs everywhere, how will I clean them up – and if I don’t then there’ll be ants… people will get angry... I'll get fired... nada nada nada

Round and round, same thing for every single damn option.

And the crazy thing? All of that floods my brain instantly and processes in not even two seconds flat.



Anyone else go through this cacophony? No wonder we are constantly exhausted!! Why can’t our brains just casually take the simple alternative: ‘No biggie, you can just stop and get yourself breakfast at the nice little coffee shop just round the corner then calmly head over to the office when it's ready’

Whether you’re traveling near or far, the right bag can make all the difference. Here are our top picks for durable, stylish, and reliable luggage to suit every traveler’s needs.

***Here's a quick list of top luggage:***

* [**TUMI 19 Degree International Carry-On**](https://bestreviewsgeek.com/tumi-19-degree-international-expandable-4-wheeled-carry-on-luggage-review/)

Let's look at each of them:

# [1. Samsonite Freeform 21-Inch](https://bestreviewsgeek.com/samsonite-freeform-21-inch-carry-on-a-smart-choice-for-travelers/)

This is my go-to carry-on for flights. The hard-shell design makes it feel practically indestructible, and after dozens of trips, it still looks brand new—no deep scratches or cracks. The four spinner wheels roll effortlessly, even on carpeted airport floors, and I love how lightweight it is at just 6.5 lbs. It also has an expandable feature, so I can squeeze in extra souvenirs without worrying about stuffing everything into an overpacked bag.

# [2. SwissGear Sion 29-Inch Softside](https://bestreviewsgeek.com/swissgear-sion-softside-expandable-luggage/)

For longer trips, this soft-sided suitcase is a lifesaver. It’s got tons of space, and the expandable design means I can always fit just one more outfit. I used it on a two-week trip, and the tie-down straps kept everything from shifting around. The multiple front pockets were great for keeping essentials like my travel documents and snacks easily accessible.

# [3. Travelpro Maxlite 5](https://bestreviewsgeek.com/travelpro-maxlite-5-carry-on-is-it-worth-the-investment/)

The Travelpro Maxlite 5 is one of the lightest carry-ons I’ve ever used at just 5.4 lbs, but it’s still durable and well-made. The H20 Guard lining protects against spills (great for coffee lovers like me who always seem to have a leaky cup), and the expandable design adds extra packing space when needed.

# [4. Coolife Suitcase Set](https://bestreviewsgeek.com/coolife-suitcase-set-3-piece-carry-on/)

If you’re traveling with family, a luggage set is the way to go, and this Coolife set is perfect. It comes in different combinations, including options with a weekender bag and a backpack, which makes it a versatile travel companion. The TSA lock keeps belongings safe, and the multi-directional spinner wheels make moving through crowded terminals a breeze.

# [5. TUMI 19 Degree International Carry-On](https://bestreviewsgeek.com/tumi-19-degree-international-expandable-4-wheeled-carry-on-luggage-review/)

If you want to travel in style (or just invest in seriously high-quality luggage), TUMI is hard to beat. This suitcase has an ultra-sleek design, but what really impressed me were the compression straps that kept my clothes wrinkle-free and the USB-C charging port for keeping my phone powered up.

# Verdict

For a reliable carry-on, I swear by the Samsonite Freeform 21-Inch—it’s tough, lightweight, and airline-approved. If you’re looking for a great checked bag, the SwissGear Sion 29-Inch offers durability and space. Need something lightweight? The Travelpro Maxlite 5 is an easy choice. Families will love the Coolife set, while those wanting a premium option should go for the TUMI 19 Degree Carry-On. No matter where you’re headed, investing in good luggage makes traveling so much easier.",1,1743230666.0,u_CurvevyGal,0,1.0,False

It was 3:21 PM when we got back to the cafe. I got a coffee for ¥453, leaving me with ¥47 for snacks (I didn't buy any, though). Ririka arrived a short time after we received our drinks.

""This time, I just went on a tour around the place, and then we looked at the comms room. There's a map of the area, and the comms room connects to every location with a.....""

She took a sip off of Aki's drink. ""...yeah. Well, anyways. What about you?""

""We turned rocks into gas. It was fine.""

""Ahh,"" she nodded, ""yep.""

There was a couple seated in the next table. They were holding hands and drinking iced tea and everything.

I felt someone touch my face. It was a bit of a sharp sensation, and it kept prodding at my cheek. I turned to stare at Haruto.

""Hi."" He gave a big wave.

""....Hi,"" I said.

Aki and Ririka were the main centers of the conversation. It looked pretty lively. But the prodding started again. Annoyed, I started tapping his cheek.

""A-ahh, wait...."" ""Shut up.""

""I will never. For as long as I live, I will neavghhh-sorr--"" I grabbed his nose and started pulling on it a bit. That seemed to get him to calm down, and he soon pulled away, caressing it.

author's note: before I say this, I'd like to apologize for what you're about to hear AND for breaking your immersion, but.....just so you know.  it's possible to substitute the word 'penis' or 'vagina' into the last two sentences and still retain a coherent message. try it!

""Hakizaki-kun?"" Somewhere along their conversation, their attention had turned towards me.

""Mmm?""

""We were wondering about the interview. Have you got any update on that yet?""

""I'm not sure if they're even coming? They messaged me about the details, and I did answer, but they haven't responded yet.""

She nodded. ""Hmm...that sucks. Worst-case scenario, let's assume worst-case scenario. Is there another local company that

it cuts off here.

ChatGPT's response:

...might take your application instead?""

I nodded slowly. “There’s a couple. Not as big, but I could try. Maybe one of the research startups near the station.”

Ririka leaned back slightly, her coffee in hand. “Right, right. The one with the weird hexagonal logo?”

“That’s the one,” I said. “They’re mostly into environmental data stuff, but I think they’re expanding.”

“Could be a good backup,” Aki chimed in. “You’ve got experience, and your thesis was solid. People will want that.”

Haruto, now sipping his own drink and mercifully leaving my face alone, added, “You could also just lie. Like, straight up. Just tell them you invented the rock gas thing by yourself.”

I raised an eyebrow. “You want me to lie on a job application?”

“Not lie,” he said, very seriously, “strategically embellish.”

Everyone laughed. Even the couple next to us smiled at the sound.

---

**Author’s Note (again, sorry):**  
If you *do* try the word substitution thing from earlier on Haruto’s “caressing it” part, I regret to inform you that it *still* works. This is a problem. This is a writing problem. I need to go lie down.

--- 

“Anyway,” Ririka said, brushing off the laughter, “we’ll keep an eye out too. If we hear anything, we’ll pass it along.”

“Thanks,” I said.

The moment hung there for a second, warm with coffee steam and low conversation. And then Haruto leaned in again.

“Wanna poke noses again?”

“No,” I said, but I was smiling.

1jmgb00,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1jmgb00/an_ode_to_my_old_man/,An ode to my old man,"It's been almost 6 years when I lost my Dad. Frankly, I'm amazed at the fact that I'm still here and somewhat thriving. But that's also a testament to how well he raised and prepared me for life, even without him. As morbid as it may seem, I think both of us knew that he will be with me for a short amount of time compared to his other kids. He was already in his mid 50s when I got into the picture and raised me as a solo parent. 

The first couple of years after his death was a blank to me but recently, I'm starting to remember some of our fun memories together. Dad was materialistic in a sense which I find kinda funny because he spends it on tech and gadgets. At some point during the introduction of BT speakers, he had 4-5 in his bedroom but was also not using it lol. He thought the aesthetic were fun but did not match the vibe of the rest of his room lol. 

Dad never got mad at me whenever I did something stupid or break expensive things. I remember breaking our semi brand new 72 in plasma tv (wasn't as properly mounted as I thought it was so it fell screen first into our coffee table) and called him crying, apologizing and explaining what had happened. First thing he asked was ""Are you ok? Are you hurt anywhere?"" It's fine -"", ""TV lang yan, basta ok ka lang, I'm ok din."" When he got home that night and saw the damage, he said it's fine and he was glad I was safe. The next day, I got a message from my cousin saying ""Balita ko nasira mo ung tv nyo ah"" and found out that dad told everyone in the office about it and got somewhat teased about it everytime I visited hahaha. I don't think he was proud but I think he found it funny lang din, or maybe show me that it wasn't a big deal at all. 

I think that was my first big fuck up with him so I was really prepared for some type of punishment considering the value of the TV but he actions showed that I was more valuable to him and that's when I realized he really loved me. Not saying I didn't feel it before this incident but I guess it showed me his way of giving love. Typical businessman dad things lol. 

Another ""big"" fck up was when I side-swiped/hit a parked car during my first couple of months driving a car. First thing he said in a chuckle ""Sa lahat ng kotse na pwede mo mabangga, ung nananahimik pa sa tabi ung natamaan mo."" And trying to hold himself from bursting into pure ROFL mode. We talked to the owner, paid for the repairs and once again, told the entire office about it.

The only time he was tampo/mad was when I had to work in a call center to support ourselves financially because he got scammed and lost all our savings. For sure it was a mixture of disappointment, embarrassment and humiliation on his part (he felt like he chained me down due to the situation he got us in, not him being disappointed at me for working at a call center, more on he got me into a situation I was never supposed to be in) and despite my reassurances, he asked me to quit and just stay with him. And so I did. 

Essentially, he taught me to not take life too seriously and have as much fun as you can (responsibly), he also taught me a couple of ""parental loopholes"" because I had to be tougher than most people considering I'm 4'11 and a girl. Typical he was going to give me the world and not ask for anything in return (maybe peace of mind and be little less makulit) 

Now that I've accepted and survived his passing, I've realized that he has kept his promise and has still got me covered. Didn't get any inheritance because he didn't have a will so from being penniless to now having a great wfh gig and a satellite baby US citizen fiance from an well off family. I'm pretty sure he pulled a lot of strings up there to make sure I ""comeback"" to life after he died because there is no chance that I got here without some help/blessing from him. With that, I shall also continue our deal to live the rest of my life with as much fun stories and memories I could tell him about when I meet him again. ",2,1743230018.0,OffMyChestPH,2,1.0,False

That was the first piece of me that they took—that I had given up. Without any fanfare, and without any need, if I’m completely honest. So stupid of me.

<<*Put the tip of your pinky finger in your mouth,*\>> they had said, without speaking. <<*Have a taste. It‘s the greatest feeling in the world…*\>> 

And they were right. The tip of my finger broke off, crisp and clean, like a delicate cookie wafer. I felt no pain—only a subtly sweet and sticky syrup combined with a satisfying crunchy texture. My pinky was the best snack I’ve ever had, and ever will.

Afterwards, the hint of maple just a whisper on the back of my tongue, I stared at my hand, at the tiny, missing space where earlier there was flesh and nail. Now, only a healed nub remained. I marvelled at the newborn pink of the skin, flawlessly and invisibly stitched back together. I savoured the taste of my finger and felt sadness and longing towards its fading memory. I really should have been more alarmed, but truthfully, I didn’t mourn the finger tip itself.

<<*Tell people you lost it chopping onions*\>> they winked, without winking. 

Their form defied description, and maybe comprehension. A vaguely human shape, with kaleidoscopic skin and features that danced in the corners of my vision and ran when my eye settled on them. Staring directly at them too long induced nausea, as if I had just swallowed a cup of sugar. But within the shifting landscape that they wore, I spied glimpses of both horror and ecstasy. I couldn’t help but shudder. I was repulsed. And yet I wanted more. 

When I think back to that first meeting now, I feel so dumb. It wasn’t like I was starving at the time. I wasn’t even hungry for a snack. I was simply *bored.* And the next thing I knew, there it was, in the corner of my living room, an ominous haze next to the TV I had been staring at.

A pleasure demon. <<*A connoisseur of all creation.*\>> At this line, I sensed it give an exaggerated, bowing flourish. A smirking grin lay behind its ever-shifting mass. 

<<*I’ve collected so many wonders of this world. Give me a taste of yours, and I’ll share mine. A fair trade, no?>>* They laughed—a sound like tinkling wind chimes overlaid on an infant’s scream. 

<<*Think on it.>>*

\*\*\*\*\*\*

The next thing they took from me was the colour purple. 

Which, again, really didn’t seem so bad. Purple’s not really that popular of a colour is it? Now whenever I stare at the eggplant emoji, I just see… nothing. Or rather, the colour “nothing.” Not grey, not black, but a pure emptiness, in the rough form of a suggestive vegetable. It’s like there’s a small, purple-shaped void in my mind. 

It had been yet another Friday evening that I was about to spend by myself on the couch. I had few friends and zero plans, but that was something familiar to me. The small studio apartment I called home felt like both a cage and a cave; something that kept me in, but also provided comfort and shelter and safety from the outside. It was when I was debating between Netflix or Youtube that the pleasure demon returned.

In return for the colour purple, they told me a story. But not just any story—the Greatest Story Ever Told. I remember a soft, golden hum, slowly filling my mind. I remember tones that sang sweeter than any music I’ve ever heard. I remember joy, terror, shock, and wonder. I remember gasping at the plot twists, crying at the deaths, cheering out loud at the triumphant climax, and crying, again, at the satisfying resolution. 

Afterwards, when I stared at my phone and realized that I had been listening to the story for seven hours, when I raced to my computer to write it down, I realized that I remembered none of the details. Nothing but a lingering memory of that experience, pleasant with a hint of the grotesque, something I grasped desperately for but remained just out of reach. 

<<*Don’t you worry,>>* the demon cooed. <<*I’ll be back.>>*

\*\*\*\*\*\*

Next, I lost the ability to dream. 

The pleasure demon had returned on another Friday, but this one capped a particularly rough week at work. One of those weeks where nothing went well, and everything felt harder than it should have. 

When I saw the pleasure demon out of the corner of my eye in the kitchen, I felt excitement and relief. As stupid as it sounds, I almost wanted to embrace the demon like a friend. 

<<*Tough week?*\>> they asked, with a very good approximation of sympathy. 

“Give me a good one,” I replied.

<<*Good One coming right up!>>*

The demon’s vague form had been a few feet away, on the other side of the kitchen. But the next thing I knew it stood in front of me, filling my vision with that unsettling, writhing mass. I felt a chill run through my spine and a brief moment of fear. But the demon reached out— touched— then *pushed past* my skin, and the chill was replaced by a slow rolling thunder that began in my toes, picking up heat and momentum as it travelled up my body, before erupting in bliss when it reached my throat. I opened my mouth, maybe to scream, maybe to gasp, but instead my mind shattered into a million pieces of pleasure. 

When I returned to my body, it was Saturday morning. But it took a few days before I discovered that I could no longer dream, days that I mostly spent trying desperately to cling to the fading memories of the euphoria I experienced that night. When I realized what had happened, what I had given up this time, I was struck by not only horror but also, for the first time, regret. I liked my dreams. I liked the ability to escape in my mind, to tell myself stories. This time, I did mourn my loss.

I decided that I needed to arm myself with knowledge. First I tried Googling “pleasure demon,” but I only found resources for painting miniatures or references to video games. And my demon is very real. Next I tried ChatGPT, which (of course) was even worse. Then the local public library, where “pleasure” and “demon” together gave me a real grab bag of options—but all fiction. 

Finally, I decided to search the dusty independent bookstore a few blocks over. Crossing its doorway was like stepping over a threshold into another world: From a busy urban street into a musky memory from centuries past. The space was small, like most downtown businesses, but books—most of which looked like they had seen better days—cluttered every visible surface. No other customer was inside, just the storekeeper quietly reading behind a giant, scarred mahogany table that served as the checkout counter. She didn’t look up when I entered. I picked an aisle under the “Non-Fiction” sign that was barely hanging on to the ceiling, and dove in. 

After an hour of fruitless searching, I returned to the woman at the checkout table. 

“Hi, excuse me,” I nervously asked, then cleared my throat. “Do you carry anything about, uhm, pleasure demons?”

She had looked up when I first spoke, but at the last part a different expression subtly took over. She searched my face, while I held her gaze, hoping that the creases she wore, the complete opposite of my youth, was evidence of wisdom and experience that she may gift onto me. After a moment that stretched just slightly too long, she slowly shook her head. 

“I can’t help you with pleasure demons.” She rolled the words out slowly, as if recalling something ancient from her past. “No one can. You must help yourself. I’m sorry.”

I was a little taken aback; this was a strange response to me asking about books, after all. But as I turned to leave, she suddenly reached out and imprisoned my hand in a tight, leathery grip. She showed surprising strength for a person of her age—I could feel her middle finger sharply squeezing the nub of my pinky—as if she’s decided to pour all the energy available to her into this moment. 

“The people who have— who have asked this question.” She stared directly at me with an intensity that was unnerving, her bird-like frame slightly trembling now behind the desk. “All their lives become worse. All of them. Without fail.

The only difference is how fast they fall.” 

She squinted at me for a second longer, then released me, and the intensity and energy faded as quick as it came. 

“Sorry I can’t help. Have a nice day.” 

I left the store with a stomach churning like a stormy sea. The encounter at the bookstore unsettled me, and I resolved to make no further trades with the demon.

That resolve lasted for three months.

It was the start of yet another weekend to myself, when the pleasure demon returned. I don’t really know why they showed up when they did. Things in my life were fine. Maybe this time, they were the one that was bored.

<<*I’ve been thinking of you. Dreaming of you, you might say.>>* They laughed, setting my eardrums aflame. I wanted to speak up, to tell the demon to leave, but I surprised myself by realizing that their appearance felt like a pleasant surprise. Joyful memories of what I’d experienced in the past, faded as they were, returned to the centre of my mind. And yet again, I found myself trading a part of myself away. 

Like before, a night passed without me realizing it. When I returned to my apartment, I found a chunk of my arm missing. Where there was once flesh, now there’s a crater in the shape of a near-perfect rectangle, two inches on the long side, right above the crook of my elbow. The indent was covered with thin pink skin that buzzed with a faint stinging sensation. I could see the paleness of bone just beneath the floor of the unnatural, boxy depression. I screamed.

After hyperventilating for a few minutes, then passing an empty prayer of thanks for my concrete walls, I turned my attention back to my arm, the disfiguration no less awful than moments before. It was like my arm was dough, and someone removed a piece with a cookie cutter. I felt vomit creeping up my throat. To this day, I stick to long sleeves.

I wish I could say that was the end of my exchanges with the demon. It should have been. But I made one final trade. 

In this last encounter, the experience of euphoria was tainted with the knowledge of my sin, and fear of what I’d lose next. The answer, as it turns out, was three weeks of my life. 

When I finally left that realm of bliss and returned to the world, I found myself lying in an unknown alleyway. I felt dampness under and around me, including on what I quickly realized was the dumpster I was leaning against. A morose, inky sky, with a faint orange glow on the edges, told me that it was night in the city. As my eyes adjusted to the dimness, I was hit with a heavy stench. 

Where I was, how I got here, and how to get home—I soon realized these were the least of my worries as, horrified, I examined my body. Within the tattered rips of my shirt, I could see still-healing scratches and bizarre, spherical punctures, like stabbings from a Bic pen. And covering it all, covering *me*, from head to toe, was a heavy, thorough cake of blood and shit. I was the stench. 

Thankfully I still had my phone, though I dropped and cracked it on the grimy alley ground when I saw the date.

The worst part wasn’t the shame I felt snaking my way through the city in that state until I finally reached my apartment (that I remained in the same city after all that time was another small mercy that I’m grateful for). 

The worst part also wasn’t the work of building the fractured fragments of my life back together. My job was gone; the few friends I had, barely hanging on. And I never did escape the suspicion and shady remarks from the landlord after being late on rent for two weeks. 

The absolute worst part are the shards of recollection that impact without warning and explode my soul, like a streaking hot comet from the dark recesses of my memory. I can be buying groceries, catching up with a friend over coffee, or lying in bed at night, when I'm struck down by a flash from what I know to be some moment within those three weeks. A twisted grin. A howl escaping my throat. A flash of blue fabric, that I had ripped off another moments before. A coldness, from metal on my bare thigh. When these moments strike, I’m paralyzed by disgust and self-loathing. A few times, I’ve let loose a cry of anguish. Once, I broke into tears. 

An unscarred mind. The chunk of my arm. And of course, the tip of my pinky. Those are some of the things I traded to the pleasure demon, and that I’ll never get back. For there is no way to beat them, no way of winning, and no escape. The demon remains an occasional presence in the corners of my vision. Even now, as I’m writing these words, I can see that amorphous, glittering, evil shape in the corner of my living room, offering their sweet and empty promises. I sense that my story even has its tacit consent. Perhaps they see it as publicity—a promotional pamphlet—but don’t be fooled. You know now: A deal with a pleasure demon is a deal you can’t break.

How long my current strength will last, I don’t know. What I do know is that, for the rest of my life, the pleasure demon will remain in the shadows of my eye, and in my moments of frailty, I can count on them whispering their words of false wonders against the barriers of my mind:

Hey,
I’d love to get your help with an issue I’m having.

Every day, the minute I wake up, I have to use the toilet for number two. Then I have breakfast, drink coffee, and soon after, I have to go again.

I don’t have diarrhea or anything like that—this has been my routine for years. Lately, it’s become frustrating because I have to wake up about two hours earlier just to finish this morning ritual before I can get on with my day—taking my daughter to school and getting to work.

I’d like to reduce the frequency to just once in the morning. Does anyone know the best way to train my gut to do that?

“Created a Hinge profile for my friend(30F)who lost her boyfriend in 2022. She’s ready for love again, but refused dating apps. I matched with a guy who seems perfect, but he stopped responding. Was I wrong to do this without her consent? Should I try to reconnect with him and be honest about the situation? Help me figure out if I’m doing the right thing”



My best friend is one of the most incredible people I’ve ever known. She’s 30(F) stunningly beautiful, kind to her core, and emotionally intelligent in ways that make her a rare gem. But life hasn’t been easy for her. In 2022, she lost her boyfriend the only man she had ever loved and been with. Their relationship was pure and special, and his passing shattered her world. Watching her go through that heartbreak was one of the hardest things I’ve ever experienced as her best friend.
Since then, she’s been focused on work and keeping to herself she’s an introvert, after all. Her lifestyle now is simple: work, come home, and repeat. She doesn’t socialize much or put herself out there, but I know deep down she deserves happiness and love again.
We’ve been friends since childhood, so I know her better than anyone. Toward the end of last year, we had a very deep conversation where she said she was ready to let another person into her life and move forward.
I suggested that she try using dating apps, thinking it might be a good way for her to meet new people since she’s not very outgoing. But she was firmly against it she just didn’t want to use them at all. I understood her hesitation but felt she was missing out on potential connections.
So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and created a Hinge profile for her. Yes, she had no idea, but my intentions were pure; I just wanted to give her a way toward meeting someone amazing. I carefully crafted the profile to reflect who she truly is: smart, humble, down-to-earth, and with a heart of gold. I included simple photos that showed off her natural beauty.
One day while scrolling through potential matches on Hinge (on her behalf), I came across a guy who seemed perfect for her. His profile exuded kindness and maturity, and something about him just felt right. So, I liked his profile.
To my surprise, he responded quickly! He started asking questions about “her,” and since I know my best friend inside out, it was easy for me to answer as if I were her. We chatted for about a week, and the more we talked, the more convinced I became that he could be a great match for her.
As we chatted, he shared that he had recently come out of a relationship and had been single for about 18 months. He also mentioned that he had gone to therapy to work through his emotions and was now ready to start a new relationship. This resonated deeply with me because my friend had also been through therapy and was ready for love.
The guy said he would like to meet “her,” but when he asked if she drives, I said no even though she does—because I wanted him to come to Manchester for their first meeting. My plan was simple: set them up for a coffee date where they could meet in person.

But then… he stopped responding.

I didn’t want to give up so easily. I sent him my phone number (pretending it was hers) so he could reach out if he was still interested. After that, I deleted the Hinge profile entirely because my fiancé found out what I was doing and encouraged me to come clean with my friend.

Now here I am reflecting on everything. My fiancé thinks I should tell my best friend the truth about what I did and he’s right. She deserves to know about the effort I put into finding someone for her because it all came from a place of love and care (though I know she might be mad at me).
If I get the chance to speak with this guy again, I plan to be honest with him too. I want to explain the situation and see if he’s still interested in meeting my friend. She’s just lovely the kindest person I know and I’m sure he’ll appreciate her warmth and compassion.

Do you, as a friend, ever take steps to help your best friend find love or get into a relationship? I genuinely want to know if what I did was right as a friend. Was it wrong to create a dating profile for her without her consent? Should I try to reconnect with this guy and be honest about the situation? I’m torn and need advice—am I doing the right thing, while I really want to reach out to this dude. ",0,1743229498.0,relationships,11,0.13,False

1jmg4et,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jmg4et/my_mom_and_fiance_hate_each_other/,My mom and fiance hate each other,"So this all kinda starts a year ago around February 2024. I (25 at the time F) and my fiance and now father of my child (24 at the time M) had just moved in together he moved into my house I had lived in for about 5 years prior with an ex and when that relationship ended I got the house. So around mid February he moved in with me and things were going so good for us. My mom (48) had been struggling financially in the state she lived in, she's currently got fatty liver disease and a slew of other issues she had struggled with for most of my life after beating leukemia when I was young. Well my mom calls one day just freaking out telling me she's not been eating(she had been telling me for months she can't afford groceries) and that her bills are piling up and she's thinkong she'll be getting evicted. Well I'm concerned, obviously, so I go ahead and tell her if she absolutely has no other options she can move in with me and my fiance. I talk to him about it and he was very understanding and wanted to help as well. So after a few phone calls with her about how nobody wants to be around her and that she is just a burden we convince her that it may be in her best interest to move in being that the state she lived in has a very high cost of living and the state we live in is one of the cheapest states in the country. So we make a plan to help her move here in May. Her plan is to save up to buy an RV to move into so she can just move around all the time. She said she'd be able to accomplish this in a year.

May 2024
I fly out to help her move we pack a rental truck and her car up and I get to see a bunch of my family I haven't seen in a while and it was great we made a 18 hour drive in just 1 day we get everything moved in and everything is great. My fiance and my mom meet and they actually hit it off quite well. 4 days later I realized I had missed my period and took a pregnancy test and we found out I was pregnant. Well when we find this out I tried to not panic I was mostly in shock cause I hadn't really been careful most of my life and just managed to not get pregnant and thought I was just not super fertile. I go through the options and was not sure if I wanted to get an abortion being that I didn't know if I could get what I would need for a baby financially and now that she could cause she was paying like a quarter of what she was for housing living with us my mom immediately offered to help pay for whatever we need for the baby and whatever I need through my pregnancy if that is my main hang up on keeping the baby. And I will honestly say it absolutely was the main reason for me considering an abortion.We all had this conversation together at my dining room table and agree we will keep the baby and my mom will help us get what we need to get a nursery set up ( I have a little unfinished room off the master bedroom in my house my mom was occupying the only other room in the house) and anything she may need for her first year. Throughout my pregnancy my mom reassures me that she will still be able to leave in a year between April and June. I ended up getting most of everything from friends my mom paid for a car seat and getting the babies room set up and some little odds and ends like baby soap and a grooming kit etc...the pregnancy was very rough for me I didn't enjoy it and couldn't do much of anything from how sick I got, I ended up having to quit my job which sucked cause I just started in my career just 5 years ago and was just starting to get somewhere with it money wise. My fiance was slightly spiralling in the beginning and this was causing issues for my mom cause he would drink and she thinks anyone who drinks at all is an alcoholic. I'll say he was drinking a lot more than usual but we were expecting a baby very early into a new relationship and that is very scary and I felt his behavior wasn't out of hand but honestly understandable I knew he would get it together and he did very quickly. We also have not necessarily an open relationship deal but more of a don't ask don't tell policy because those kinds of things just cause jealousy issues and frankly if I don't know about it I don't really feel the need to care or be jealous. My mom was told this when she moved in. The main rule is no sex in the house unless it's with each other, however there are lots of parameters set that we both are aware of one of those things is that we genuinely don't mind if either of us cuddles someone else. I'm a hippie and have had a lot of cuddle parties and have been a part of many group cuddles and what have you. 

Fast forward to January 2025
Our daughter made her entrance into the world mid was through the month. Not less than the 4th week of her life, it's my fiance's niece's 21st birthday, she requested him to come celebrate and help keep an eye on her girlfriends while they get drunk and possibly DD I am fine with this. He messages me that night to tell me one of the girls can't go home cause something is happening with the other people in her home and asked if she could just stay the night at our house. I am fine with this. They get there and girl is super wasted but is trying very very hard to be respectful I get her set up with pillows and such and she's getting very touchy feely with me and also with my fiance, didn't bother me she was drunk and just being extra and I also happened to know my fiance just isn't interested in her anyways. Well he had a couple beers once he got home and he passed out on the couch and she also passed out on the couch, I just didn't want to deal with waking him up cause he's a hard sleeper so I left him there and went to bed. Well I was woke up the next morning not to my baby crying for a boobie but to my mom who was livid because my fiance is on the couch cuddled up to this girl. I said yes they fell asleep on the couch and I really don't mind that he's cuddled up to her, doesn't bother me. Well I finally get up cause she's just still going off about how weird and uncomfortable this all is for her and how upset she is for me (even though I wasn't upset) so I get up and go to make breakfast and wash pump parts. I wake up my fiance and he take the girl to the gas station with him to get us all coffee and energy drinks, while they are gone my mom takes this opportunity to lecture me about love loyalty and respect because I clearly don't understand those things because I wasn't upset about them cuddling, lecturing me as I'm breastfeeding my newborn, doesn't give me a minute to respond before grabbing her keys and leaving. She then calls me crying about 20 mins later telling me that she is going to move out because she is uncomfortable with what is going on and can't watch me be ""cheated on"" I try to explain to her that this is just my relationship and it really shouldn't matter this much to her especially since I'm okay with all this it shouldn't be this big of a deal to her. She insists she feels like she needs to leave, (she had apparently talked to my older brother and he also told her he thought she reacted poorly and that it doesn't seem like her business) she decided to text me later and say she'll stay but she would like me to ask my fiance to not bring any girls around and cuddle them on the couch anymore. So when he got home I told him what was up by that point my mom was home and smoking on the porch. He was confused and wanted to talk to her himself. He walked outside and calmly asked to have a conversation about the subject and she immediately started crying and texting me that she was going to tell him what she really thought and asking me to make him stop she doesn't want to have this conversation. An issue she made and she didn't want to actually deal with it. I didn't do shit. I sat down in my livingroom and listened to the whole conversation which started out with my mom telling my fiance what a piece of trash she thought he was comparing him to her own horrible ex's and screaming at him. He maintained his composure. Once she had screamed for so long that she had woken up my baby 5 times I finally put the baby down and walk out to tell her to basically shut the fuck up cause she is disturbing my child, and she started yelling at me before I could say anything. That was the straw that broke the camels back for my fiance. He got loud for the first time ever since we got together and I was shocked he was yelling at her that she couldn't speak to me that way. No one has ever told my mom she couldn't talk to me poorly except for him. It was a very conflicting day for me and life has been conflicting ever since. She tried to lie to me and say he said she had to leave by Monday the next week. Now I was sitting there the entire time. He never said that to her. But that was what she was trying to make her reality. Anyways she basically told him that she can talk to her daughter however she wants and he basically told her not in front of him and not in this house. She started running through the house screaming and yelling about how she hates him and wished he was dead and that she is gonna sue us for grandparents rights because she paid for that baby and it's HER baby too. I had just about had enough so I went to the stairs where the fight had moved to I went to try to separate the two of them. And she started yelling at me again. So he yelled at her again. I finally got him to go chill and I tried to make it clear to my mom that she didn't pay me to have a baby for her, my baby is MY baby and HIS baby and no one else's, that she is a guest in my home, and that no one is making her leave she had said prior to the argument she wanted to leave. (At this point she had called both my sisters and my brother and told them all that we were kicking her out on the streets) She the told me I betrayed her and disowned me. My brother calmed her down and we avoided her the rest of the night. Anyways things never really got settled my mom basically went on to act like nothing ever happened the next day and things have been very stressful for me and my fiance since, she threw in my face that she bought stuff for the baby and stuff for me and said she could've been gone already if she hadn't put so much into me and my kid, so I insisted that we no longer ask her for money while she's still here trying to buy a house now because apparently she would've never been able to buy an RV because she has no real credit history as far as major purchases go, and the only loan she qualified for to do any of it was to pull from her 401k. So now she's been her since for another month now. And she is just happy as a peach acting like everything is perfect and she's just getting a house cause she wants to now and not because she tried to impose on my relationship and it didn't work. And my fiance has been gone every weekend all weekend since then trying to avoid her and I need him here because I need him to help with our baby, but he's uncomfortable being home now because she is here and she literally said she wished he would die. Today he told me that she is either going to be gone by rent time or she's paying half of everything tile she's gone ( I see this as a huge issue cause I already have told her I don't need her money and I think she's going to take this as an opportunity to make it seem as though we can't pay our bills even though I've had steadier housing than her since I moved out of her house. She works from home and he's at the point where if she doesn't leave soon he's going to shut our Internet off to chase her out.

Advice 
So I guess that's the jist of the situation I am just trying to put the feels lmout and see what other people might think. I am feeling at this point like I'm at a rock and a hard place she's my mom and I do care about her however she's been absolutely horrible to me since she's been her emotionally and verbally she's been abusive, I'm so accustom to this from her it's easy for me to just ignore it. But because she paid for baby stuff for us I feel like I have used her mainly I think because she's thrown it in my face. I feel so manipulated by my mom but still feel this sense of obligation to make sure she is not homeless. On the other hand I don't want my fiance to feel like he can't come home during some of the most important bonding time in our child's life. She needs both her parents not her mom and grandma who is and emotional wreck. I'm struggling with my parenting duties because of her at this point. I'm just honestly so scared to have the conversation that she's either gonna leave or start paying for her place of living again. I feel like she's going to use it as a reason for her to stay if she pays us again. And I feel like she's going to tell all my family members that she is being kicked out if she just leaves. How would one approach this situation and what do I do. I am not trying to let my mom break up my honestly perfect relationship, the only problems we have had are because she has an issue with him and I have to deal with it cause we all live together. She's putting such a strain on my life and I'm only 8 weeks postpartum. Please anyone any help or advice please.",2,1743229209.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

There's already so much noise on the Internet about kids and screen time, and a lot of it is fear-based. So right now, I only want to hear from older teens and young adults who have been through this themselves. Please read the whole post before offering advice, and please refrain from judgment or criticism. Thank you!

We are a homeschool family and my daughter is a tween. We started with no limits on technology and are scaling back. We have made major strides in getting my child back from the worst of the online world. Tiktok and Snapchat are gone, we are cooking together daily and spending a lot more time together offline. However she still spends a lot of time playing Minecraft and watching YouTube videos about Minecraft. Like, sometimes all day... I can definitely see the positives in terms of creativity, collaborarion, setting goals, etc, but something feels off and the problem is that I don't know where to draw the line. The limits others recommend (for example, 1 hour per day) seem arbitrary, and so I would struggle to stand by them.  

She plays Minecraft alone but mostly it's while chatting with friends on Discord. She spends time in the morning waiting for her friend to wake up and call her so they can play, and she would do it past 9pm if I didn't shut off the wifi then. She would play/watch every waking hour if I didn't intervene and invite her to do other stuff, which fortunately works very well. But she rarely wants to go outside. I have to force her. And then she's glad she did. Last week I taught her a gymnastics thing at the park and she was really proud of herself and asked to go back to do it again. She wants to go to day camps this summer. 

My other issue with the Minecraft/discord thing is her friends are not even that emotionally stable or capable of being what I would call ""good"" friends. I mean, they are kids, so by definition, works in progress. But they express jealousy toward her instead of being happy for her when something goes well in her life, get offended over really minor things, typical of kids with a trauma history. I'm happy she has kids to play with but I don't want them to replace me and I'm wondering how much time with them is too much. 

I, personally, do well not having wifi in the home and only checking it at the library or coffee shops. I also like going to coffee shops because then my daughter is online but we are also together and connecting. But it's not so good for gaming, obviously, due to noise. Wherever it is, I could do with 1-3 hours internet per day (I work from home) and wonder if I should go ahead and implement this in our home. ""Wifi hours 1-4pm"" or something. 

I would just worry that I'm not allowing my child enough social contact. She's huge into digital art, gacha, etc and has an active online art community from which she derives a sense of identity and belonging. Someone else posted here (but comments off now) about ""phases"" of online involvement for kids including Minecraft, Roblox, Gacha, etc and I really wanted to ask, does that mean this is like a pipeline of internet addiction? Or what does ""phases"" mean here? And how do we separate their creativity from the crap? If gacha is a bad direction to go in, I could trust that she'd find other offline outlets for creativity. We are mainly relying on the Internet due to being geographically isolated. 

Without criticizing, please, I'd love some insights or a reframe to help me get some clarity and traction here on how to navigate these issues. Thank you! ",2,1743229101.0,nosurf,1,1.0,False

Long story short I got trespassed and everyone is blowing up my phone calling me the asshole for no reason.

So am I the asshole?

Edit: I forgot to mention I really hate fat people because a fat guy murdered my entire family.

Edit: Also trans bad because one murdered my other secret family.",9,1743228975.0,AmITheAngel,4,0.92,False
