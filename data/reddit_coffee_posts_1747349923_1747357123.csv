1kno9mo,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kno9mo/steaming_milk_coffee_together/,Steaming Milk & Coffee Together,"  
Once I was at my uncle's house in the late 80's or early 90's and he had a standalone electric milk steamer. He had a cup of drip coffee, he added milk to it, then steamed it and said that makes a cappuccino. I was getting into coffee around that time and I remember thinking he must not know what a cappuccino is but I didn't want to say anything. 

Recently I saw a James Hoffmann video where he showed a clip from a James Bond movie. Bond was making coffee with a La Pavoni and it looks as if he's steaming the milk and coffee together. 

I also purchased a LaVazza Espresso Point recently. In the manual it instructs to put the milk and espresso together in the cup then steam them together to make a Cappuccino. This machine uses pods and was sold to restaurants so that waiters could easily make coffee drinks so I can understand they wanted to simplify the process and not require the staff to have additional training. 

  
Was this, steaming the milk and coffee mixed together, ever a popular technique? Maybe decades ago or in the early days of espresso bars?",2,1747356876.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1kno7td,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kno7td,My day with a caterpillar,"I don't know anything about caterpillars. However, I was working and I saw this guy on the side of a gas station crawling around, and I had never seen a red caterpillar. The sun was soon going to be blasting this entire wall, so I guess I felt like he might need help, so I looked him up. Found out what kind of caterpillar it was (pipevine swallowtail) and watched him crawl around for a while while I took lunch, debating on if I was gonna ""help"" or if Id be helping at all. I don't really like bugs, and Im somewhat extra creeped out by caterpillars, so that was a factor as well. 

But, I decided to empty out (and clean) my coffee cup and walked around the parking lot looking for random sticks and some plants, and added a little bit of water. I didn't see any around where he was, he was somehow stranded on this brick wall with nothing but a gas station parking lot around. I ended up putting the coffee cup habitat next to him, and he crawled right down the stick. He didn't seem super interested in any of the plants, so I looked up if they will just eat any plant. Turns out they apparently won't they will only eat pipevine. I google this plant, literally never seen it before in my life. And apparently it, and the caterpillar are toxic lol. So I walked around the parking lot perimeter again looking around for this plant - nothing. When I get back near my work van I see a little busted looking plant sticking out of a crack in the sidewalk. It appears to be super wilted pipevine. I wasn't sure what to do, there won't be any rain any time soon around here, this plant is just in concrete getting baked by the sun. I pulled it up as gently as I could to take it with me, but the plants roots also didn't look good.

He had to ride around with me in a coffee cup for a couple hours, tried to keep him out of direct sunlight. On the long ride home I noticed he just kinda hung out on one stick most of the ride. When I got home, I found a larger plastic container and did my best to make a little nicer habitat, and re-plant the bit of dead pipevine I had. I transferred him over to the new habitat and left him alone for a little bit. I come back shortly after and I notice him just chilling in a weird pose on a stick in the habitat - I look and up and HES ALREADY DOIN HIS BUTTERFLY THING. Apparently they make a little silk swing and relax on it. 

And then it got crazier - the second to last picture (the super close-up of him chilling) I took at around 230 the day I brought him back home - maybe an hour after moving him to the new habitat. The last picture, with him starting his chrysalis, was only about 3.5 hours later. 

I guess to caterpillar people thats probably normal but it was crazy to me, one of my concerns with taking him was that his host plant appeared to be dead, and if it died he'd have nothing to eat before turning into a butterfly. Guess that wasn't an issue - although Im still a little worried about what to do because the re-planted pipevine doesnt appear to be doing well (it was already basically dead, it seemed) and I know the butterfly will be looking for that plant. 

Anyway, thats that. My sister said I should share the story. Currently hes still in his chrysalis, its been about 5 days. I keep the soil in the container moist, but not too moist, and Ive killed a few small ants to make sure they didn't try to mess with the chrysalis in the early days. Still trying to decide if I should just let the butterfly go and hope it can find a pipevine or try and buy one from a local nursery and maybe plant it nearby?

I will test before and be at about 85-105 and with the sugar it will spike to about 140-150 but with the vanilla syrup it will stay the same or even drop. This morning I was 108 and drank the vanilla latte and dropped to 87. This is always prior to meal eating, generally I won't eat until after my morning spike goes down (first 2 hours of the day sugar spikes and drops down).

I dont take medication, I used to many years ago take metformin but my doctor took me off the medication after 2 weeks of low blood sugar from it, my lowest while on the medication was 64. I control through diet and exercise alone and watch my levels like a hawk and meticulously track what spikes me. 

I am very curious as to why there would be a difference between the granulated sugar and the vanilla syrup. Theoretically they are nearly identical amounts of sugar. Teaspoon of granulated is about 4-5g sugar and the vanilla pump is 4-5g sugar. I've generally always used sugar and just accepted the small spike and made sure to exercise after, but I bought a bottle of the syrup after testing this multiple times. I'm going to switch from granulated to the syrup and see what happens over the course of a few weeks.

That confused me. I'm 25. She looked to be college aged to mid 20s, maybe 27-28 but even that seemed a stretch? The she said she was **37**. I didn't believe her so she showed me her ID and it said March 1988. My eyes widened too the point where she started laughing and blushing. I am usually great at guessing age and I would've never clocked this woman to be born before 1997 let alone late 30s. She didn't have a single fine line or anything. 

Looking back it made sense. She spoke with maturity and composure I don't see from chicks my age. I feel good now.

1kno3a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1kno3a2/i_cant_get_over_feeling_used/,I can’t get over feeling used,"
I’m sorry this will be a bit long, I’m a lesbian and we met at work. I wasnt looking for anything and she was the one who initiated it all, she got my number, asked me out, etc. On the first date (I didnt even know it was one) she told me so many personal stuff, she talked about her difficult childhood and how she treated her ex like shit because he was super clingy, of course after all this, I was so sure and convinced she wasnt good mentally and it never crossed my mind to have something with her, I didnt text her when I got home, but she did after a couple of days and then we started to text everyday and making plans. I never trusted her at all while we kinda dated that month, because I got very bad vibes from her, I guess I kept going because I found her interesting and I like going out a lot, so it was nice to have someone to talk and make plans with. A couple of times she told me she wasnt looking for a relationship and I said I wasnt either, which always kinda shocked her, I always had the feeling she was a control freak.

After that month that we dated, she had to move to another city to take care of her mom, that’s something I knew from the beginning and another reason why there was no way I wanted to start something with her. She was gonna be away for only 3 months, so at the end since everything was going “good” and we seemed stable, we decided to try long distance, at this moment it felt a bit more serious. I have abandonment issues and I have to admit, despite all the red flags, I started to feel more comfortable with her, because she had already left the city, but not me, she was staying with me. She lovedbombed me since day one, saying how I was her crush and all the times she thought of me or wanted to talk to me, how I was the best thing in the world, etc. When she left I started to believe it all, I think we got closer because all we had were our chats and some calls, she was very matured emotionally and she always made me feel so safe, she encouraged me so much to talk about my feelings, I’m FA so that’s very hard for me, but she made it so easy. I thought I’ve finally found my person, someone who was finally going to stay, she even bought a plane ticket to come and see me, but sadly we didnt make it that far, she broke up with me suddenly 3 weeks after she left. I took it okay because she explained how the distance was so hard for her, that she missed me too much and couldnt support her mom that way.

After 3 weeks I was completely fine, and she texted me (this was what ruined me emotionally until this day) she drunk texted with the most romantic paragraph ever, I fell for it, but then she said she wasnt looking to get back together, she just needed to talk to me because she was hurting too much. I got mad that she had broke NC without any intentions of working things out and I said we would discuss everything in the morning when she was sober. The next day she apologized, and we had the most romantic day of all of our time together, she was very romantic, said she’ve been wanting to send me flowers, my fav coffee, etc. And I finally let myself express my feelings for her, I shared some letters I had wrote for her when we broke up, they had helped me while I was missing her, she read them and said she was crying, that she had no idea I felt that way for her, because I was always distant and that she loved this version of me so much.

We went NC again, until the day she was supposed to visit me with the ticket she bought, I sent her flowers at the office because I couldnt go that day, we talked, she seemed a bit different, but I didnt mind, we hadnt talked in a month, she said she loved them tho and that she had been carrying a letter I wrote for her everywhere she went to feel me closer, we met only for a few minutes, she said she couldnt stay because she was too anxious and it wasnt good for her to see me and leave again. 

After a couple of weeks she texted me twice, to tell me she had heard my name on a meeting and couldnt help but smile, and to say she had been thinking about me a lot.

3 weeks after those texts, I texted her because it was time for her to come back, we had a nice conversation and the next day I told her I thought we could start talking again since she was already coming back and I could help her get set up on an apartment. She said she was confused because she wasnt looking for a relationship anymore, she told me she had gone to therapy to get her closure and that she was fine and didnt want it anymore, I was obviously shocked, because the 3 months she was away, she was the one texting me letting me know she couldnt stop thinking of me and stuff, we talked about it the whole day, because I couldnt understand how she had changed her mind like that and acting as if it I had been wrong to wait, she said she was going to stay at the other city for one more month and that we could see what could happen when she was back.

It was the worst month, I have ADHD so the thought of waiting to know what was gonna happen was too hard to go through, even if it was just for closure because of course I felt used, betrayed, heartbroken, abandoned. 

When she was finally back I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt and just be friendly, I thought I didnt have to be anxious because I knew her and she had always been good to me. I saw her and she hugged me very tight for about a minute, I didnt expect a long hug like that tbh, it felt beautiful, I was truly happy.

I gave her space and didnt reach out because she had told me coming back was gonna be hard for her after leaving her mom, but then she texted me after a couple of days, we had seen each other in the hallway and she said I had looked at her as if I was pissed and she couldnt take it and wanted to know if we were alright, I told her that was nonse and that I was very happy to have her back, she got all weird cutting the conversation and when I asked her what was wrong she turned it into an argument, we ended up fighting, I told her how I felt about her sudden change and I asked for space, she apparently got very pissed about it, because even my friends noticed she kept looking at me as if she hated me, so one time I ran into her, I told her we needed to talk, because it was awkward and we work in the same company, she said she didnt want to talk and now she needed space. That space turned into like a month and a half until I told her it was crazy and we had to talk already, because I couldnt deal with the constant awkwardness.
She finally agreed, altho we fought a couple of times after, because she kept saying there was no rush and stuff.

When we finally met it was awful, at first we caught up with our lives, that was ok, but then I said we needed to talk about what happened, I have to mention that prior to talking she had sent me an audio a couple of days before where she had apologized for everything and she said we could talk deeper about it in person, but then when we were in person and I brought it up, she started to avoid ir af, it took me some minutes to start myself because I’m also avoidant but I knew it was important, so I gave my version, she gave hers, we had some agreements and then we went to her place, that’s where things got bad, at some point I asked her and she said she wasnt attracted to me anymore, that she didnt love me anymore and she even started telling me about another woman she’s interested in, she wanted me to tell her what she felt about thst woman, because she couldnt understand, she said she just knew she was drawn to her. She also showed me how one of her new years resolutions was to “be open to other romantic opportunities” when a week before she had tolde she wasnt looking for a relationship anymore. Of course that was all fucked up and hurt me af, after her behavior since she was back, I didnt want her anymore, but I still had feelings, I got every “answer” I wanted from her that night and I left her the next day. She even had the nerve to tell she still hadnt felt for anyone else what she felt for me, she wanted to meet me again and I said yes knowing well I was gonna dump her ass the next day after I had processed everything. 

We havent been in contact in about 2 months. I avoid her at work, so I’ve only seen her from afar 2 or 3 times, but I still get very bad feelings, I get anxious, not because I want her back, but because she literally came just to hurt me, she made me open up to her and have feelings just to leave me, it’s as if I had been just a challenge, when she had me, she stopped wanting me. So I feel used, I feel betrayed and it hurts so much, it’s crazy to see the messages and see how much she changed suddenly. I know I had the last word since I was the one who stopped the contact last time, but I still feel as if I’m the one who lost because she broke my heart and I cant shake that feeling. I dont want to know anything about her ever again, but at the same time I wish she would reach out, just so I could be the one to say No this time.",2,1747356310.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

Here’s the step-by-step—let’s nerd out!

Weigh 0.55oz of coffee, grind medium-fine for a V60 cone. Set the machine to a 1:15.1 coffee-to-water ratio and 197°F. For the blooming (65ml total), the important point is split it into two phases to mimic barista pours. First, set a 30ml center pouring phase: low RPM, 7-9 ml/s F-rate (flow rate) for a tight, focused pour. Then, a 35ml cycle pouring phase: medium RPM, 3-4 ml/s for even coverage. Program these via the touchscreen—double-check total bloom water hits 65ml. After blooming, pour the remaining water (use the 1:15.1 ratio) at 3-4 ml/s, medium RPM. These settings can approximately simulate the effect of center pouring, while cycle pouring is a function the machine has always had (The video is to demonstrate the ""center pouring"" and ""cycle pouring"" settings of this machine, so I didn’t add coffee)

Although ""center pouring"" still involves some rotation, it’s already the maximum extent this machine can achieve. Of course, it’s possible there are other settings I haven’t figured out yet. However, Gevi might update with a true center pouring function in the future. I’ve been giving them feedback that the machine’s UI is too difficult to use and very confusing, and recently they improved their UI.

* **Moss Garden** – This has to be one of my favorites. It smells exactly how I imagined—like a rainforest after rain or literally a moss garden. **Would I buy again?** Yes.
* **Autumn Leaves** – I can see why people might like this one; it has a sweet aroma. But for me, it’s overly sweet and doesn’t quite click. **Would I buy again?** No.
* **Golden Pavilion** – One of my favorite autumn scents. It reminds me of apple pie, cinnamon-baked goods, and those scented pinecones you find in arts and crafts stores. **Would I buy again?** Yes.
* **Cherry Blossoms** – Personally, I don’t smell much besides burnt firewood. **Would I buy again?** No.
* **Plum Blossoms** – This is what I had hoped *Cherry Blossoms* would smell like. It’s delicate, light, airy, and has a very welcoming scent—floral, but not overly so. **Would I buy again?** Yes.
* **Eternal Treasure** – This may be one of the most traditional Japanese scents I’ve experienced. It reminds me of my great-grandmother’s bedroom, full of old perfumes—but in the best way possible. **Would I buy again?** Yes.
* **Overtone Cinnamon** – I was excited to burn this one since it smelled strongly of cinnamon beforehand, but after lighting it, that scent completely disappeared. **Would I buy again?** I’m unsure.
* **Overtone Palo Santo** – As a lover of palo santo, I was pleasantly surprised at how accurate this scent is. Many others on the market miss the mark, but this one is spot on—less overwhelming than the raw wood but still very true to it. **Would I buy again?** Yes.
* **Overtone Vanilla** – My second favorite Overtone scent after *Palo Santo*. It’s a cozy, warm fragrance that works well for autumn and winter. It reminds me of Coffee-Mate vanilla and hot chocolate—in a good way! **Would I buy again?** Yes.
* **Overtone Frankincense / Sandalwood** – I grouped these two together because I was disappointed with both. As others have noted, they smell quite similar. I couldn’t tell them apart, and both are too faint and overly vanilla-forward to clearly identify. **Would I buy again?** No.
* **Friend of Pine** – I know I mentioned being disappointed with this one in an earlier post, but it’s starting to grow on me—possibly because I keep burning it. It leans more syrupy than spicy, in my opinion, and I have to really *envision* a pine tree to pick up the pine notes. **Would I buy again?** I’m not sure, but it would be an autumn/winter scent for me.

I hope this doesn’t deter you from trying any of these scents—everyone has a different nose. What I may like, you may not, and that’s totally okay. It’s all part of the experience of buying and trying incense. You won’t know until you burn it!",2,1747356279.0,Incense,1,1.0,False

SW: 200 lbs 
CW: 184 lbs 
GW: 140 lbs 

I recently had a medication change and have sort of been fasting without trying to, as I don’t have time for breakfast and I have my coffee black. 

Because the previous medication made my appetite increase, I gained around 60lbs (my GW how heavy I was before gaining). 

I’m not sure I believe in starvation mode as I’ve been continuing to lose weight, despite having a MUCH less healthy diet compared to when I was heavier. My weight loss also hasn’t stalled significantly. Of course it was faster at the start, but it has a pretty stable rate of decrease. I used to do weight training and running when I was heavier, and now I just walk around, so basically very little exercise. 

Has anyone got any personal experience of reducing calories and then having trouble losing weight? It doesn’t make much sense to me as many people on this subreddit have lost significant amounts of weight by fasting for long periods of time! 

Also, is the set weight theory true? If so, that might be an explanation for this circumstance I’m experiencing. 

Sorry it’s long!! 

TLDR: Have lost significant amounts of weight and am sceptical about whether lower calories slows metabolism.  ",1,1747356175.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

The company is a major firm but its office branch in my city is fairly small. Everyone regardless of their departments works in the same area with rows of open desk style work stations. There is a small kitchenette in a corner and that’s about it.   That man’s creepy behaviour started feeling off putting on literally my second day when I went to the kitchenette (it’s angled so it’s hidden from the main office space) came up right behind me to grab a coffee. It was weird but I brushed it off and then today during lunch out of the entire empty seating, that man sat right beside me. Again, I brushed it off and continued talking to my coworker. But the weirdest part is today as I was leaving that man came to talk to the coworker seated beside me and continued talking for a while. I found it weird how he kept trying to make a conversation with her continue but I focused on wrapping up my own work. About 15-20 minutes later I shut down my computer and start putting on my jacket and at this moment that man also frantically starts grabbing his bags. Now actually weirded out I walk towards the elevator quickly and get inside while on call with a friend. Usually I take the stairs but it’s more of a fire exit with long empty corridors but today my gut told me to take the elevator and run out the building. The moment I left I turn around and that man walks out right behind me from the fire exit and follows me until I get into my car.

The app's designed to display weather data from a different angle, so it's not map driven, and you don't have to pay $250 per date of loss to visualize what happened in your home town. I don't yet have custom algorithms sizing up potential hail, I only report on actual events and will eventually support with visual evidence for your decision-making needs.

Highly built upon free and publicly available API, so it's a large ingestion, storage, and dashboard display and data management system with real-time and sophisticated alerts which drive the real value to users in the moment of severe weather and date of loss storms in the area of willing to drive sales people.

Truth of the matter is most of that data out there is completely freely available and I've built a dashboard that lets you visualize it like you're reviewing your checking account after a hazy night at the bar. Color coded, clear choices for what to do when you wake up.

Additional features include publicly available property data, GIS, polygon enabled map overlays for business owner zeroing in on who they care about and where their potential customers live.

I've incorporated probability algorithms for active warnings from global sources and deliver real-time warnings for hail and wind before it's recorded as a date of loss or storm prediction Center certified report. Once it's confirmed, you're ready to plan your route.

It's in a buy me a coffee beta phase but think I've built something on replid that's far beyond in MVP and will soon be connecting it to oauth and stripe for monthly payments for a reasonable cost, and will continue on this experiment for as long as possible to prove that building a functioning salable app with happy customers as possible beyond a Google search console, white labeled dashboard sold as a SaaS company.

I'm using minute by minute hourly and daily crown services to fetch, store, organize into postgre databases, well running enrichment algorithms to enhance national Data for weather reports.

I've also built in a personal Al assistance to assist with potential business opportunities, sales team Management, canvassing strategy, and have more ideas I don't even want to share yet.

We're currently implementing a multi-tiered authentication system that uses Google OAuth for initial account creation and login, with plans to introduce a secondary, phone-based verification layer to support account integrity and user trust in high-sensitivity workflows. 

The primary OAuth flow is already structured and deployed with domain-specific redirect URIs, and we're investigating the most cost-efficient methods for augmenting this with additional identity verification. Future builds will require tokenized session management (JWT or hybrid with HttpOnly cookies), environment-aware client ID routing, and optional step-up authentication for admin-level actions.

Long term, we need infrastructure that supports multiple identity providers (Google, email magic link, phone), all connected to a unified user schema keyed by phone number or email. Our auth layer should also accommodate scoped access roles (user/admin/moderator), rate limiting, and audit logging for all auth events. We anticipate future integration with native mobile app environments, so the solution must be extensible across web and mobile, with refresh-token flow and biometric fallback in mind although web app wrappers are most likely at this point. 

Preference is given to developers familiar with Firebase, OAuth 2.0 protocols, secure token issuance, and scalable backend API design in a modern stack (e.g., Node.js, Flask, or FastAPI).

Overall it is a data-intensive weather intelligence and restoration enablement platform engineered for high-volume ingestion, analysis, and display of severe storm data. At its core, it automates the processing of SPC event reports, NOAA feeds, and enriched geospatial data tied to county- and parcel-level overlays. These inputs power a real-time dashboard that prioritizes responsive design and client-side filtering for high usability across mobile and desktop. Our system uses automatic ingestion pipelines (via scheduled cron jobs) and database enrichment logic to correlate weather data with localized parcel records, roofing age, storm history, and other predictive attributes. The frontend displays these insights through a structured events table, dynamically filtered by time range, state, hail size, wind speed, and user-defined preferences, making it actionable for restoration professionals in the field without having to have the brain of Mike's weather page.

A predictive layer will combine historical event data, meteorological trends, and region-specific risk patterns, offering a strategic advantage to contractors and service providers. AI will also be integrated into the support system to provide real-time context-aware assistance based on user behavior, geographic territory, and stored canvassing logs. 

At the end of the day we are organizing data to make sound decisions and before anyone in the comments points it out, and I'm sure they didn't reach it this far yes, I used AI to help write this because again, I'm a replit user and an encoder. 

Looking for anyone who finds any of this shit. Interesting

let me explain.

in january 2024, my mum was diagnosed with a stage 4 glioblastoma (a brain tumour) and was given 6months - 1 year to live. she had palliative radiotherapy. her prognosis was updated to “a few weeks” in october 2024. shes still with us 7months later. i’m so proud of her and im so grateful for the extra time we’re having together. 

i’m her carer. i live with her. my partner also lives with us, and he looks after her in the evening when im at work. he works nights part time. i work part time hours with an agency. i left my work for a short period for personal reasons before my mum got sick. before i left i was a supervisor with contracted hours. i came back when my mum was diagnosed bc i needed the familiarity and security (security, ha). i do all care, except personal care. we were give 2 carers for 4 calls a day to do personal care and to make sure she’s comfy - moving her around the bed, etc. 


okay. that’s the back story. onto why im making this post…

everyone has abandoned me. my mums friends, my friends, my family, my work. 

i’ve always struggled to make friends, and so don’t have many. but since my mum has gotten sick i realised how shitty everyone is? nobody reaches out to me, if i reach out, nobody really cares to hold a conversation. this also goes for family members, but onto that later. i just feel so alone, and i feel like i have no one who really supports me other than my partner. for example, i met a friend twice in the past 3 months. first for coffee, then for drinks. the first time she basically spoke about her life. which was okay, you know? i understand everyone needs someone. that we all need a shoulder. i didn’t really think anything of it at the time. 
the second time we met, she asked a little about me, how im doing. i didn’t want to it to get gloomy, so i mentioned about work (we work together - ill explain what i spoke about further on) and i felt like she was just waiting for me to finish talking? i felt so awkward! i kind of just mumbled the end of whatever i was saying, waited for her response, but there was none. she just launched into what she had to say, her issues at work -i understand people try to relate using their own experiences, but she didn’t even touch on what i said at all- her life, her kids, her husband, her holiday. i was thinking “oh maybe she’ll realise and might respond to what i said?” no. we didnt mention what i said again. since then, i’ve kind of been hesitant to even reply to her. i just feel sad about it. 

the situation with my family is a similar story. i saw 2 members of my family and 1 of my mums friends during her palliative radiotherapy sessions in march 2024 and that was the last time i saw or heard from them. my mums friends just show up uninvited and stay for extended periods, after my sister explained my mum has gone downhill and doesn’t want long visits anymore. and we want to make sure mum is mentally prepared and aware people are coming over. 

i have received messages from 2 family members. if people message, they message my sister. i’ve only ever received a couple “im here for you, we should go for coffee” texts from my aunt, and they were so performative. we’ve been out a handful of times. and the offers dried up after i opened up about my mental health. i explained that im struggling so fucking badly with everything going on. i cried to her. there was a period where i was so depressed i completely isolated myself, stopped replying, nobody checked up. it’s not been the same since. 
the texts have slowly dried up, despite me reaching out multiple times. the conversation just gets ended by her, usually by just reacting to my messages, instead of actually replying with words. the offers for coffee dried up a long time ago. my aunt now regularly meets up with my sister for coffee and they go out to dinner. at least once a week. and my sister ALWAYS finds a way to make sure i know they’re meeting up. i’ve explained multiple times to my sister that i feel so isolated, it just feels like salt in the wounds. i’ve asked my sister what i did wrong? she said that she doesn’t think i’ve done anything wrong, that my aunt said she’s “really worried about me” and she “knows i’m really struggling right now so doesn’t want to bother me by adding more to my plate”. i don’t understand how she thinks isolating me further by not inviting me anywhere and not talking to me anymore is going to help my mental health?

my sister isn’t around, like i said. she’s here for 30mins and goes home. if i ask for help she just says “no you do it” “it’s okay :)”. she brings food or flowers every now and then but there’s no physical or mental support.

the work situation i mentioned earlier - as i said, i was a supervisor at this company. left for personal reasons and have returned after my mums diagnosis. familiarity and security. i know everyone. i’m close with my manager. they know what’s going on in my personal life. that i have a dependant - my mum. i went to the office one day in a panic, because my mum got covid and i thought she was going to die. i realised i hadn’t sorted anything! i was worried about money, having to plan a funeral, having to take time off. so i sat with my manager and explained the situation and she said not to worry. she would guarantee my hours for now and if i need to go full time after my mum passes, she will also make sure that happens too. not even a month later, they cut my hours to 1 day a week. 4 hours. my mum was better by this point, but i still have bills to pay and food to buy. it’s now month 3 of 1 or or 2 days a week. so 4-8 hours a week. despite speaking to my manager and multiple friends who have said they want to help, none of my friends actually want to help. all of them say “that’s so awful” but because they’re contracted and i’m agency, they don’t care. this is why i think my friend didn’t really say anything when i explained all my shifts were cancelled when we met up. i know she can’t do anything but i feel like nobody has my back. my manager said “this is literally too much for one person to handle” when i explained that im so stressed. and then did absolutely nothing to help me. 

side note - everything in my house is breaking, dishwasher, dryer, door handle, tv. i joked to my partner “why didn’t these things break when we had money?”😭 

my mum gets a tiny bit of money from the government, but it barely covers the outgoing. me and my partner only work part time because of mum being sick. we know she doesn’t have much time left. we’re hanging on, but by a thread.

my mums carers do nothing but add to our stress. constantly leaving more things for us to clean up or sort. rude attitudes. not even doing their jobs properly. i’ve had to wash my mum so many times after them bc they just don’t. we’ve spoken to them. it’s so neglectful. i can’t even go into detail here bc this is already too long. but we’ve contacted our council, the nhs. we want to change our carers but we’re being messed around. one person sends us to another place and so on.

i’m so stressed and depressed im starting to notice it in my body. i’m feeling sick after every meal, having acid reflux, my skin is so fucking dry. i’m crying almost every day. i’m so angry all the time. watching my mum decline every day is so hard. just knowing i’m losing my mum is the worst thing i’ve ever experienced in my life. it hurts to realise not a single person in my life (other than my partner!) wants to be around or support me. i am so depressed. its been getting so bad again recently. it’s so awful. but i just feel like the whole world is against me. i feel so isolated. and i am scared. so scared. i’m scared of my brain, of life, of death. of how people can feel so comfortable with turning their backs, people i thought cared. people i thought i could rely on. 

i’m scared this is already negatively impacting my relationship with my partner. idk what id do without him. he’s honestly been amazing through this. 

i just don’t know what to do anymore, i feel so helpless and hopeless. i’m so tired and so sad. i’m partly venting, but i genuinely want advice. i feel like im going to have a huge breakdown.

any advice on how to help? or jokes or memes or idk. i’ll take anything at this point. or any idea where to make friends that genuinely care about me?🥲 or what to do about my family abandoning me? or how to help my relationship?

if you got this far, thank you. 

if not: TL;DR
my mums is dying and everyone abandoned me. my family and my friends. my work cut my hours so i have no money. i’m so depressed bc im so isolated. idk what to do anymore. advice on what do?

If you were to inspect the post at a glance, you would also come to the same conclusion as the original poster that this was a video of Eli San Fernando expressing his support for the Duterte clan and that he was a member of Iglesia ni Cristo.

However, if you watch the video (either from Tiktok or Facebook), it becomes crystal clear that this was a strategic move from Eli San Fernando to woo Duterte supporters.   
  
I consider this a smart play coming from Eli considering that **one (1)** he does not have any sort of parliamentary experience or affiliation with any other big political families, **two (2)** he doesn't have a big political machinery the same way that political families do, **three (3)** this was a good publicity for the progressive movement (a good way to introduce Duterte supporters to progressive ideals and possibly invite them to become one).

This was a similar move that Bam did with the INC-- by doing negotiations under the table. Smart play from both politicians.

Looking forward to this dude's performance in the House of Representatives. Not expecting a lot but expecting a lot of small but consequential gains for the greater good.

This is why the board has decided to employ the Agile system as our primary method of productive development and team **synergy**.

We encourage the use of 2 week *sprints in* the the Reddit branch of Atrioc llc. These sprints will be outlined by your managers, however the structure of each week must adhere to the guidelines outlined in the handouts given to you before the meeting. In case you need a recap your day to day will look something like this:

 \- Start with a team meeting where you describe what you did the previous day and hope to achieve today. Decide what methods need to be implemented to best generate the optimal shitposts. Group discussions are pivotal to team synergy.

\- Begin your independent work. Using the knowledge gained during your morning team exercise, discover what you can do to further improve the meme you are working on.

\- Remember, any thoughtful essays are on the company's time so make sure to get your important work done before switching away from talking about glizzy hands.

  
Our motto for this year at Atricorp is ""kindness,"" so helping your team out is very important. Make sure to cheer their day up by buying them a fresh cup of coffee from our sponsor: MOOOFFEE.

1knnrs8,https://www.reddit.com/r/csuf/comments/1knnrs8/advice_from_someone_graduating/,Advice from someone graduating,"Well, my graduation is next week. Here’s some advice I feel like may be helpful for people who are about to go to CSUF or are feeling a little lost and need some guidance: 

1. Take advantage of the opportunities on campus. Use your resource centers. Go to the free events, even if you’re alone. Go to tables on Titan Walk. There’s always stuff being given away. Also, check what you’re already paying for with your tuition!! 

2. Actually talk to people. Seriously. I’ve made some of my best friends by literally just talking to people next to me in class. Just be friendly, get outside of your comfort zone, and you’ll find someone (or even your group). Most people here want to talk and be friendly—be part of that group!

3. Stay in contact with professors you like. Go to their office hours or email them from time to time. It’s nice to have a “mentor” but also someone in case you need letters, etc. Also, stand out in class. Ask questions, interact. 

4. Check out the area! Fullerton is a great city—there’s a lot to do in the area. After classes, if you have time, go somewhere nearby and grab a coffee, walk around, etc. 

5. Get involved. Seriously. Get. Involved. Join a club, join an organization—it doesn’t even have to be in the same route of something you’re studying. It’s so simple to go to classes and then go home, but getting involved makes or breaks your college experience. Go to Discoverfest every semester.

6. Be gentle with yourself. I know this is way easier said than done, but take time for yourself every single day, even if it’s just a few minutes. Learn what calming techniques work for you. Take walks, try to stay grounded as much as you can. 

Congrats to my fellow titans graduating and good luck to everyone still on their path 🧡

1knnokr,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1knnokr/fall_for_my_exs_mafia_dad_by_caroline_above_story/,"Fall For My Ex's Mafia Dad by Caroline Above Story. Free novel alert! Just leave a comment, and I’ll give you the full story link","# Chapter 1

My ideal lover would be a guy who is not in a hurry to get laid, loves literature and books, and is polite.

My sister says that such men are extinct in the 21st century. She accused me of always daydreaming about nerd stuff, which is why I still haven’t cashed in my v-card.

I mean, why should I? I've never been in love before. I’m just waiting for something more intimate.

But I'm living in a fairy tale now that Daniel has shown up. We've been dating for a few months now after falling in love at first sight at a bookstore.

He's thoughtful and attentive and a good listener, which is often the role I play - after all, my specialty is counseling. He doesn’t try to push me to go too far too fast, which sets him apart from other guys and suits my own pace perfectly.

Today, in the bookstore where we first met, I take a sip of my cappuccino as I look over my boyfriend’s tall, lanky form, his curly chestnut hair falling into his green eyes. Daniel always dresses so nicely, today in perfectly-pressed grey pants, a shining silver watch at his wrist.

Wait, I think, narrowing my eyes and looking closer. Are those diamonds below the glass face?

I bite my lip, wondering why my boyfriend has a diamond watch. I mean, I’m just a broke grad student – is he rich?

There’s movement over Daniel’s shoulder, and as I look, my eyes go wide. “Daniel, there’s…a guy over there. And he’s staring right at us.”

Daniel turns to look directly at the brawny guy, well over six feet and chorded with muscle. His professional suit does nothing to disguise the roughness of his hands, the cruel scar that runs diagonally over his face, almost splitting his nose in two.

“Oh, um,” Daniel says, shrugging. “Don’t worry about him.”

“Don’t worry about him!?” I whisper, a little scared. “Daniel, he’s looking right at –“

“No, I mean, he’s with me.” Daniel gives me an apologetic smile as my mouth falls open in shock. “That’s Parker, he’s…well. He’s kind of my body guard.”

“Oh,” I say, pulling my mouth shut into an awkward O. I stare at Daniel. He needs a bodyguard? How rich is he?

“Yeah, just ignore him,” Daniel says, giving me a cool smile. “My dad gets overprotective,” he rolls his eyes at this. “Honestly, he’s so stressed out about safety that he could use a shrink like you to give him some counseling.” Daniel laughs at this, lightening the mood.

“Anytime,” I mutter, nervously playing with my long red hair, worrying about the mismatch between Daniel’s wealth and my church-mouse status. I’ve never met anyone before who has a bodyguard.

“Can I get you anything else?” Both Daniel and I look up at the baristo who smiles down at us, a really handsome blonde-haired guy who has an apron tied around his waist.

“No thanks, Colin,” I say, giving him a big grin.

“Actually, can we both get refills?” Daniel says, giving Colin a slow smile.

“Oh, actually…“ I say, looking up at the clock and pushing my hair back behind my ears. If I don’t leave now, I’m definitely going to be late for my job doing psych evaluations at the state prison.

“She’ll take hers to go then,” Daniel says, rising from our sofa. “Here, I’ll help you.” He follows Colin back to the coffee counter.

I start to pack up my bag, intent on catching the next trolly, when I notice Daniel’s phone vibrating on the table, a call coming in. When the number disappears, Daniel’s home screen shows a family photo. The tall man in the back is certainly his dad, the other maybe an older brother?

As I try to puzzle it out, the phone rings again – the same number. On impulse, I grab Daniel’s phone and sling my packed bag over my shoulder, heading towards the coffee counter.

“Daniel,” I say, slipping behind the counter, “you’re getting a phone call –“

But there’s no one back here. I look around, confused – I definitely just saw Colin and Daniel head this way…

I hear a noise from the storage room, a strange and muffled thump and a moan. I take two steps forward and peek around the door, maybe they both –

Oh my god. Not two feet from me, my boyfriend presses Colin up against the wall of the storage room, one fist wrapped in the fabric of his shirt – kissing him passionately -

Colin’s eyes are closed, his hands fumbling at the button of Daniel’s pants, his belt already undone, whispering his name – my boyfriend’s name –

“Are you kidding me!?” I yell, not even thinking as I hurl the phone at Daniel and his lover.

Both boys jump, leaping apart. “Fay – I – “ Daniel’s face is full of shock. Tears in my eyes, I run from the room and from the coffee shop.

“Fay!” Daniel spills out onto the street behind me. “You don’t understand!” He grabs my arm, pulling me back to him.

“I really like you,” he says, his eyes filled with apology. “You’re amazing - it’s just that my family wouldn’t understand, wouldn’t approve –“

“So what,” I asked, surprised. “You just want me to be your pretend girlfriend!? Sorry,” I rip my arm from his hand. “Not interested.”

“Please, Fay!” Daniel calls after me as I run away. “Please – I can make this right! How much do you want? One million? Three million? I can-"" I see him pull the checkbook out of his pocket.

""I don't want your money!"" I say, my voice mocking. Daniel blinks and I turn away. ""I’ll keep your secret, you don’t need to pay me off. I just don't want to see you again.""

And just like that, my fairy tale with Prince Charming was over.

I hurry down the street, my eyes filling with angry tears.

Two hours later, I’m seated at a plastic table in a cinder-block cell, my eyes dried up and my hair tied back in what I hope is a professional look. My leg jitters with nerves and, I think, a little bit of aftershock. I still can’t believe what Daniel did to me.

But I straighten up in my seat, taking a deep breath. I have to concentrate on my job now, and I’m incredibly nervous about my next assignment.

I’ve only been assigned basic white-collar criminals thus far, but today I have to make an assessment of Kent Lippert, the man known as our city’s Mafia King. His unmatched cruelty and the unbelievable lengths he takes to protect his power are infamous in this town.

I hear the hallway door clang open and stand up from my chair, pressing my hands against my blazer to straighten it. This is the most nervous I’ve been since I started this gig.

The guards bring Lippert around the corner and I’m surprised – I expected Lippert to be a fat, old, balding man – the kind of greasy lowlife who belongs in our city’s underworld.

But this man is trim and tall, moving with a kind of dangerous grace. My eyes follow the way his shoulders shift beneath the fabric of his uniform, the way that the guards quail, a little, as they unlock the cuffs on his hands.

I gasp as my eyes finally fall on Lippert’s face, my mouth going dry. His dark hair falling over his forehead, his square jaw, the deep frown lines etched over green eyes – oh my god. I’ve seen this man before. I saw him today, in a picture on my boyfriend’s phone –

And again, younger, etched in the features of my boyfriend’s own face.

Daniel isn’t just some rich kid. He’s the son of the Mafia King.

# Chapter 2

Kent leans his shoulder against the bars of his cell, his well-muscled arms crossed against his chest.

What was he doing in this local prison, created to catch the overflow of the city’s rampant gangs? He was their king, after all.

And to think, Kent was here by choice.

His lip raises in derision as he shakes his head, wondering if he made the right decision, intentionally getting caught so he could get in here, just for the chance to talk to the warden.

Two blue-uniformed guards walk down the row towards him. “Lippert?” They ask. “Warden wants to see you.” They cuff him and take him to the warden’s office.

Kent sits down on a chair in front of him, wordless, waiting for the guards to leave.

“So,” Sven says, closing his file. “I’m surprised you had the balls to come to my turn for a negotiation, Lippert. It’s brave.”

The public didn’t know it, but Warden Sven not only runs this prison, but leverages his control over it to take a significant stake in the workings of the city’s underworld. He is as dirty as the rest of them, and if other bosses go against him? He locks them up.

Quite a trump card in this world where one of the only things that stops a gangster is a stay in prison.

“I’ll be out soon enough,” Kent responds, leaning back in his chair. “We have to talk about Ivan.”

“Ivan?” Sven looks at him closely. “He’s chicken shit.”

Kent shakes his head slowly. “He’s just a kid, but he’s getting a foot in the heroin game. But because he’s green he doesn’t have the grit or the resources to handle it.” He pauses a moment, taking Sven in.

“He’s getting backed into a corner,” Kent continues, “and it’s making him ruthless. He’s not coming to meetings of the families, he’s killing at will – made men, as well as wise guys. He has to be stopped, Sven. Or he’s going to wreck it for all of us.”

Sven leans back into his chair, considering.

Kent steels himself, staring Sven down. Antony, his cousin and second-in-command, had told him it was foolish to lock himself up for months just for the chance to talk to Sven. But Kent had a gut feeling this was the right call. An alliance with Sven against Ivan was going to pay off. Big time.

“I see your point,” Sven says, breathing out through his nose. “Ivan’s too big for his britches, eh? It’s a delicate ecosystem,” he says, holding his hands out like a set of scales to demonstrate the balance. “We’ve all got to play our parts. If he pushes too far, he destroys it for all of us.”

Sven nods, considering his next words before continuing. “I have to admit, Lippert, I’m impressed with your persistence in this matter. I’ve done good work isolating myself, protecting myself, but you found a way in. Not everyone would come to my turf, and stay so long, just for a meeting with me. I respect that. You’re a real capo, a good guy. I’m glad that I know this.”

Kent nods, silently confirming this read of him. That’s exactly how he wanted Sven to feel. “Ivan’s a mad dog,” Kent says. “We’ve got to put him down. I’ll provide the muscle; all I ask is that you let us. Don’t interfere. As for the spoils…we split fifty-fifty.”

Sven eyes him, considering. “I want eighty-twenty, for my agreement to let you handle it.”

Kent doesn’t let his frustration show. He doesn’t care if Sven takes it all, honestly – Sven has power, but he’s notoriously low on cash, a problem Kent doesn’t have. But he can’t let himself be bowled over. “Sixty-forty,” he says, stern.

Sven shrugs, not agreeing yet, but not pushing the matter further. “What about the other bosses?” he asks. “Are you anticipating pushback from Alden?”

Kent shakes his head quickly. “Alden’s distracted. His guys are running the game, but he’s got some new clue about his lost kid.” He waves a hand, dismissing it. “He’s not going to take a side.”

Sven nods, giving him a small smile, and Kent realizes that Sven already knew this. Sven might not have cash, but he does trade in secrets. Likely, Alden got the clue from him to begin with. Kent narrows his eyes, realizing that question was a test.

He doesn’t like being tested. “Do we have a deal?”

Sven shrugs, again noncommittal. He turns in his chair to stare at a calendar on his wall, the picture of a beautiful vineyard somewhere in Europe. “You know, I had a lovely glass of wine the other day. From Napa. But I gotta tell you, Lippert,” he turns here, looking Kent directly in the eye. “It left me a little parched, a little…too dry.”

Sven’s lips start to lift in a cold smirk. “You wouldn’t happen to know…anywhere else. Where a man could get a finer glass of wine. A really good drink. Would you?”

Kent flicks his eyes to the calendar again, realizing suddenly that the picture on the wall is a picture of his vineyard, the calendar likely produced as a promotional gift for tourists. Sven knew exactly what Kent would ask even before he set foot in the room, and he knew exactly the price of his cooperation.

“France,” Kent says slowly, narrowing his eyes and staring at Sven. Perhaps not such a clean alliance after all. “The best wine in the world comes from France.”

“You know, I’d like to try that wine,” Sven says, turning back to the picture, all innocence. “I’d like to get a foot in the industry too. Maybe get some property there, some day.”

“Done.” Kent said. It’s worth the price.

A good meeting. Kent leaves satisfied.

As they walk down the hall, one of the guards turns to him. “We’ve been ordered to take you along to your psychological assessment before returning you to your cell,” he informs him. Kent glares at him, but says nothing.

The guard shrugs. “Standard procedure, Lippert. All prisoners gotta do it.”

Kent stays silent, following. Sven is pushing it, making him undergo psychological testing, when he’d be out of here tomorrow. He’s just trying to collect more secrets.

Kent follows the guards to a cinder-block cell at the end of the hallway, noting that his lawyer is standing outside the door. The lawyer rolls his eyes to Kent and points at his watch, indicating that he’ll have him out of here in no time. Kent nods, and then focuses his attention on the door.

He’s surprised, when it opens, to see a girl inside.

Not a girl, perhaps, a young woman – twenty-three, at the most. She stands up, clearly anxious, biting her lip and playing with the long red ponytail that drifts over her shoulder. Her mouth falls open, just slightly, as she takes him in.

God damnit, Kent thinks, his whole body going tense at the sight of her – those long legs, knocked at the knees with anxiety, her short white skirt, that ridiculous blazer that she wears so people like him will take her seriously.

He can tell from a single glance that she’s pure as the driven snow – ambitious but poor, eager to prove herself. His eyes rove over her, considering what she’d look like if he ripped that blazer off of her. He focuses, again, on those red lips, slightly parted.

His breath hisses from his mouth at the sight of those lips, at the thought of what he could do with them.

“Um,” she says, hesitant.

He snaps his attention back to her jewel-blue eyes.

“My name is Fay Thompson? I’m here to do your preliminary interview for state psychological assessment?”

Kent grits his teeth, denying his urge to smile slowly at the fact that her statements are presented as questions. God, she’s perfect, this little angel. The feral, leashed part of him wants to know what she’d look like with a little bit of the underworld’s grime smeared all over her.

I've been in the roofing industry since the middle of last year and as a marketer, non-coder with a billion ideas; and attracted to tech forward, data driven solutions and applications, have built a mid-market offering to what exists for door-to-door knockers, storm restoration contractors, public adjusters who love the hustle, even homeowners (although most homeowners don't need to check whether or not they've got 3-in hail pounding on their 20-year-old roof) and was just blown away by the Gap in the market that is interactive hail you know what maps, hailchase, wind strike and others that charge thousands per year, and still fell into the trend of being your next CRM. 

The app's designed to look at wearher data from a different perspective, so it's not map driven, and you don't have to pay $250 per date of loss to visualize what happened in your home town. I don't yet have custom algorithms sizing up potential hail, I only report on actual events and will eventually support with visual evidence for your decision-making needs.

Truth of the matter is most of that data out there is completely freely available and I've built a dashboard that lets you visualize it like you're reviewing your checking account after a hazy night at the bar. Color coded, clear choices for what to do when you wake up  

I've incorporated probability algorithms for active warnings from global sources and deliver real-time warnings for hail and wind  before it's recorded as a date of loss or storm prediction Center certified report. Once it's confirmed, you're ready to plan your route.

I haven't decided the number of free users but want to give a certain amount free access for as long as this idea lives, and highly discounted monthly rate for those who help me with feedback, ideas, suggestions, regrets, and anything other than refund notices. This doesn't have to be Philo door-to-door reps, it can be engineers, coders, replit users, starving startup, founders, or anyone else useful and motivated.

It's in a buy me a coffee beta phase but think I've built something on replid that's far beyond in MVP and will soon be connecting it to oauth and stripe for monthly payments for a reasonable cost, and will continue on this experiment for as long as possible to prove that building a functioning salable app with happy customers as possible beyond a Google search console, white labeled dashboard sold as a SaaS company.

I'm using minute by minute hourly and daily crown services to fetch, store, organize into postgre databases, well running enrichment algorithms to enhance national Data for weather reports. 

I've also built in a personal AI assistance to assist with potential business opportunities, sales team Management, canvassing strategy, and have more ideas I don't even want to share yet. 

If you're interested, here's a quick tech stack for my Replit community, and for my storm chasers, DM me for a Free 30 days for five people, and free 14 days for up to 20. 

Those who valuably participate up to five selected will receive free lifetime access.

**\- Oliver -**

""But—"" Isabela began a question but didn't finish. The girl raised her arm, looking at her gauntlet. ""It's my turn.""

Before Oliver could react, she got up from the table with surprising speed. He tried to call her but didn't have time; Isabela was already running toward the stairs, her footsteps echoing through the base's corridors.

Back at the chair, Katherine gave a slight smile and shrugged. ""We'll have to find out which arena she's in."" She raised the coffee cup to her lips for the first time since they had arrived at the cafeteria.

As soon as she tasted the first sip, Katherine frowned in disapproval and rested the cup on the table. ""Ugh. Too sweet. Want to try?"" She extended the cup toward Oliver.

Moved by curiosity, he accepted. The aroma was inviting, an intriguing mixture of coffee and something fruity. Upon touching his tongue, he felt subtle notes of raspberry and coffee, but the dominant flavor was excessive sugar.

""Raspberry?"" Oliver commented, leaving the cup aside.

Katherine laughed at his reaction. ""It was Isabela's idea,"" she explained, turning her eyes to the holographic interface on her gauntlet.

With his palate still saturated by the sweetness, Oliver got up quickly to fetch some water. Upon returning, he found Katherine absorbed, watching one of the arenas projected in the hologram. ""Did you find which one is hers?"" he asked, sitting beside her.

""Not yet. But there are some interesting arenas. In most of them, the main strategy is to hinder opponents in the other zones,"" she commented with a tone of curiosity. ""I don't understand why they didn't do that in mine.""

""Are you serious?"" Oliver asked, surprised by her observation.

Katherine looked at him without understanding. ""What do you mean?""

""Do you think someone would try to sabotage a princess?"" Oliver explained, raising an eyebrow.

""Oh! True."" She smiled, realizing the logic. ""I wasn't listening to the broadcast, but the others must have heard that there was a prince and princess in the match.""

Determined to find Isabela's arena, Oliver switched between the holographic channels. While browsing through the first arenas, a scene caught his attention.

In one of the combat zones, a tall boy with a shaved head and wielding a war hammer was facing the robots with impressive ferocity. 'Kyle,' Oliver recognized immediately.

Kyle was still in the second round, but his confrontation against the training robots was an absolute massacre. With each powerful swing of his hammer, two robots exploded in a shower of sparks and debris.

Oliver felt a chill. Kyle's speed and strength were uncommon. Oliver had grown a lot and was much more powerful than when they had their battle, yet he wondered if he could win.

He zoomed in on Kyle's face, and again, his irises were red.

Katherine observed Oliver's tense expression. ""Isn't that Kyle?""

""Yes, from House Castor,"" he replied without taking his eyes off the screen.

""The one who caused trouble with you... after my incident?"" Katherine asked, embarrassed to recall the problems she had caused.

""That same one,"" Oliver replied, still focused.

""Wait,"" Katherine said upon seeing the zoomed-in screen. ""Are his irises red?""

""Yes, I'd seen him like that before,"" Oliver explained. ""It's some kind of drug to make him stronger and faster.""

""Aetherion,"" said Katherine, frowning. ""It was an old drug but caused so many problems. I think it was discontinued during the Third Wave."" She looked at Oliver with renewed concern. ""Have they found a safe way to use it?""

""I don't know if it's safe, but at least he didn't die the last time he faced me,"" Oliver commented.

""That could change the course of the war,"" murmured Katherine. ""I need to inform John if he doesn't already know.""

She turned her attention to her gauntlet, typing a message frantically, while Oliver remained focused on Kyle's battle. Suddenly, a notification appeared in the corner of his vision:

| Left Eye of Learning  
| New Earth Army Style \[Learning …\]  
| \[10.51%\]

‘Can I learn by watching him?’ Oliver questioned himself. ‘Wait, he's using the New Earth Army style. Maybe our levels are close, and I can learn from that?’

  
The story has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the violation.  

He waited a while for a response from Athena, but there was no information.

‘I know about your system, not your skills; I can't help you with that,’ Oliver heard Athena's soft voice in his mind.

‘Alright,’ thought Oliver, resigned.

""She's in Arena Five."" Katherine's announcement snapped the boy back.

Oliver was torn between continuing to watch and wanting to support his friend, who was in another arena. In the end, he changed the channel to watch Isabela's battle.

‘I need to learn more styles to farm skills by watching other people,’ Oliver noted before switching channels.

Tuning into the new arena, he got a panoramic view of the combat zones. They were finishing the first round, and Oliver had no doubt that Isabela would advance to the next stages.

‘Her biggest challenge will be to avoid being hindered by other recruits,’ Oliver thought.

He was right; when they reached the second round, a strange student began to alter the climate inside the arena, transforming it into a greenhouse, increasing the temperature, and adding a heavy fog.

No wonder, during the second round, most of the recruits were eliminated.

However, that was not the case for Isabela, who once again managed to eliminate her opponents. With her Boon allowing her to increase her speed in any direction, she could fly between opponents, quickly eliminating them without risking being too far from her Pillar.

Her third round was more straightforward; even against three mini-mechas, her ability to fly made it very easy to circle and deactivate them one by one.

However, things got tricky when only four people remained in the final round.

Oliver banged on the table as the gate opened, presenting the mecha. ""Damn. What bad luck.""

""Why?"" Katherine asked; she could see it was a mecha specialized in stealth but didn't understand why that could be a problem for Isabela.

""It's a Ghostfang,"" Oliver began to explain.

Since he started studying more about mechas, especially with his new skills, he understood their characteristics just by glancing at them.

""It's one of the few mechas that combines stealth so well with brute power,"" Oliver commented.

Designed for infiltration missions and precise attacks, the SH-09 Ghostfang combined advanced camouflage technology with powerful armament, including its imposing cannons hidden beneath its cloak.

The Ghostfang had a sleek and aerodynamic silhouette, covered by a reinforced polymer cloak that not only helps to conceal it in urban and natural environments but also disperses thermal energy, making it almost undetectable by infrared sensors. Its muted tones of green and orange allow it to blend into environments but also impose a threatening presence when revealed.

""Okay, but she can be faster than it,"" Katherine commented.

Seeing the images, it seemed to be the same impression Isabela had. Using her Boon as soon as the match started, she tried to fly over and get behind the mecha.

""However, it has anti-mecha and anti-aircraft weaponry,"" Oliver said at the exact moment the mecha pulled out an anti-aircraft cannon from under its polymer cloak and fired directly at Isabela.

The girl, who was accelerating toward the mecha, didn't have time to change her trajectory. Isabela was hit directly and pushed against the concrete wall of her zone.

As the explosion subsided and allowed them to see the girl under the debris, it was visible that her armor was in tatters. Soldiers quickly entered her zone to provide first aid, but Oliver could see her walking out of the arena.

Katherine had both hands over her mouth, still shocked by the scene.

""It's better if we go to the dormitory,"" Oliver suggested, and Katherine nodded.

\--

Oliver and Katherine were already in the room when Isabela was finally released from the infirmary. Although her armor had absorbed most of the impact and the mecha's weapon had its power reduced for training, it was enough for her to lose.

Isabela entered slowly, with her head down and tears in her eyes. Without saying a word, she sat on the edge of her bed and cried softly. Oliver and Katherine approached, sitting on either side of her, offering silent comfort. The presence of friends was a balm in the cold and impersonal environment of the base.

For the three, the day had come to an end. They remained silent, each immersed in their own thoughts until fatigue led them to prepare for sleep.

Isabela was the first to fall asleep, still under the effect of the medications she had taken in the infirmary. Oliver and Katherine followed shortly after, their minds heavy with the day's emotions.

The dormitory was much emptier than the night before. Many recruits had already left, especially those eliminated in the first round in their arenas, who didn't even wait for the official results.

In the deep silence of the night, Oliver was awakened by a sudden noise. His eyes opened instantly, his heart beating rapidly, adrenaline coursing through his veins. To his surprise, he found himself with his hand stretched toward the ceiling, wielding his Energy Pistol.

'Shit. Again,’ he thought, getting up slowly from the bed.

Sweat dripped down Oliver’s forehead. Since leaving the prison, he had difficulty dealing with sudden noises and controlling his armor. Several times, he had woken up with it activated and weapon in hand, a habit that hadn't caused problems until then, but he feared that one day, he might hurt someone.

He promptly deactivated the armament and armor. Looking around the semi-lit room, he identified the source of the noise. Katherine was tossing and turning restlessly on the bed in front of him.

Each of them carried their own demons.

Oliver approached and sat beside her. Katherine was sweating and crying while sleeping, emitting small moans of anguish. Unfortunately, he couldn't wake her; he knew that interrupting a night terror could make it worse.

He gently passed his hand over her forehead, wiping away the sweat. In a low and calm voice, he whispered, ""You're safe; it's okay. No one will hurt you.""

It took a few minutes for Katherine to calm down. During all that time, Oliver remained by her side, a silent presence against the nightmares that tormented her.

When she finally settled, he got up and returned to his bed. His gaze met Isabela's, who seemed to have just woken up, watching him through the dim light. She gave a slight smile and nodded.

Oliver returned the gesture before lying down again. He closed his eyes and tried to calm his mind.

‘Tomorrow begins the second phase,’ he thought, reinforcing his determination before falling asleep.

# Montclair Mood This Week

Spring breezes carried a hopeful warmth through Montclair’s oak-lined streets this week. Neighbors strolled under blooming dogwoods, greeting each other at sidewalk cafés and school pickups with renewed energy. Community spirit felt abundant – from children laughing in parks to volunteers gearing up for weekend events – as if the whole town were **awakening like acorns in the sun.** There’s a gentle optimism in the air, a sense that Montclair’s local economy and heart are growing in tandem with the season’s blossoms.

# Acorn Index Update

Montclair’s **Acorn Index** grew to **$1.11** by week’s end, a modest uptick (\~+1.8%) from last week’s $1.09 and roughly +11% since our baseline. This gentle climb signals growing confidence in our town’s economic vitality [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedailysquirrel/comments/1kdo1hu/acorn_economy_week_5_april_24may_1_2025/#:~:text=r%2Fthedailysquirrel%20www,signals%20growing%20confidence%20in). Like a squirrel adding one more acorn to its stash, Montclair’s collective fortunes **inched upward**. The rise wasn’t dramatic, but it was steady – a reflection of small wins adding up. From bustling farmers’ market stalls to lively storefronts, the community’s transactions and interactions suggest a local economy finding its rhythm. In short, our acorn stash is **healthy and growing**, hinting at cautious optimism taking root.

# Acorn ETF Sector Roundup

Eight playful “Acorn ETF” sectors tell the tale of Montclair’s local economy this week, each one tracked like a busy squirrel’s stash:

* **ACH (Healthy Growth):** Montclair’s public health and safety sector nurtured some hearty acorns. Families pedaled together in a town-wide bike ride, “Kidical Mass,” on May 4th – a six-mile celebration of biking and a call for safer streets [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-4-2025/#:~:text=Montclair%20Bike%20Bus%2C%20whose%20goal,snacks%2C%20merch%2C%20and%20bike%20repair). Laughter and the whirr of bike wheels filled our neighborhoods, raising awareness about traffic safety and community wellness. Meanwhile, community health initiatives stayed strong (nearby Maplewood even hosted a free health fair), and Montclair’s first responders gave us reason to be proud. Our police and fire departments were in the spotlight for exemplary service, keeping the town safe and earning accolades that we’ll celebrate in our Golden Acorn Award below. All told, **ACH** showed robust growth, fueled by healthy bodies, hopeful hearts, and a sense of safety blossoming across Montclair.
* **ACB (Acorn Biz Fund):** Downtown businesses saw a **buzzy uptick** in activity. After 22 years on Bloomfield Avenue, beloved stationery and vintage shop *Parcel* reinvented itself with a new Park Street showroom concept [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-4-2025/#:~:text=After%2022%20years%20at%20its,cutting%20ceremony%20will%20take), inviting shoppers to curated themed weeks instead of daily browsing – a creative twist that drew curiosity and loyal customers alike. Montclair’s retail scene also welcomed back *Velvet Lush Studio*, a chic boutique that reopened just around the corner from its old spot, now offering fine jewelry and even an espresso bar for shoppers [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-11-2025/#:~:text=The%20California,shared%20with%20The%20Montclair%20Girl). Over the weekend, the **Walnut Street Fair** returned for its ninth year, and the street teemed with over 200 local vendors and food trucks [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-4-2025/#:~:text=The%20ninth%20annual%20Walnut%20Street,51%20Click%20here%20for). The fair’s live music and the scent of funnel cake wafting through Walnut Street brought crowds that delighted local shop owners. Even as a family-run eatery in a neighboring town closed its doors – a sober reminder of the challenges small businesses face – Montclair’s **ACB** sector overall brimmed with resilience and adaptation. New concepts, community events, and loyal patronage gave our business district a gentle boost, much like a **freshly brewed cup of Montclair-roasted coffee on a busy morning**.
* **ACT (Creative Sparks):** Arts, culture, and community events kept Montclair’s spirit swinging. The Montclair Art Museum hosted the YWCA’s Racial Justice Awards on April 30th, shining a light on local changemakers and honoring the nonprofit *Latinos of Montclair* for their community impact [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-4-2025/#:~:text=On%20April%2030th%20at%20Montclair,Northern%20New%20Jersey%20%2B%20president). Such recognition in our cultural hub reinforced Montclair’s identity as a town that champions diversity and creativity. On the entertainment front, Hollywood came to Watchung Plaza – or at least will soon – with a **Netflix crime thriller**starring Robert De Niro set to film at a historic Montclair building later this month [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-4-2025/#:~:text=Netflix%20Thriller%20Featuring%20Robert%20De,Niro%20to%20Film%20in%20Montclair). Excitement flickered as film crews prepped locations, and residents mused about catching a glimpse of movie magic on their doorstep. Additionally, plans for upcoming festivals sprouted: organizers of the first-ever *Montclair Porchfest*teased a town-wide music festival on May 17th, promising front-porch performances to unite neighbors in song. All these creative sparks – art, film, music – kept **ACT** buoyant. Montclair’s cultural acorns are **rolling and alive**, feeding not just the soul but also local pride (and perhaps a bit of tourism) as our town’s arts scene continues to thrive.
* **ACE (Civic Essentials):** Montclair invested in its **infrastructure and education acorns** this week. The Township Council approved much-needed improvements for our libraries – up to $5 million in renovations for Montclair Public Library’s main and Bellevue branches [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-11-2025/#:~:text=Montclair%20Public%20Library%20Begins%20Renovations,with%20HVAC%20Updates). HVAC upgrades, leaky roof fixes, and refreshed spaces are in the works, promising **cool, comfortable havens of learning** come summer. Over at 205 Claremont Avenue, civic planning took center stage: the Montclair Planning Board hosted a public hearing on May 5th to tackle the town’s affordable housing obligations [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-4-2025/#:~:text=requiring%20municipalities%20across%20the%20state,Municipal%20Building%2C%20located%20at%20205). With a state mandate pointing out 132 local housing units in need of repair or replacement [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-4-2025/#:~:text=requiring%20municipalities%20across%20the%20state,Municipal%20Building%2C%20located%20at%20205), officials sought residents’ input on how best to meet the need. The discussion is just beginning – a sign that Montclair is rolling up its sleeves on this tough issue (more on that in our Rotten Acorn Alert). Still, simply having that conversation shows **engagement and care**. Between bolstering public institutions and grappling with housing policy, **ACE** made steady, meaningful strides. Montclair is tending its civic roots, knowing that strong public services and inclusive policies form the oak-solid foundation of our community.
* **NUT (Neighborhood Eats & Treats):** Our food and essentials sector offered a mixed bushel of news – some sweet, some bitter. On the sweet side, Montclairites indulged in the treats of spring. The Walnut Street Fair’s **food trucks and local vendors** served up everything from gourmet nuts to artisanal donuts, delighting crowds and giving a tasty boost to local food entrepreneurs [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-4-2025/#:~:text=The%20ninth%20annual%20Walnut%20Street,51%20Click%20here%20for). Outdoor farmers’ markets and sidewalk dining are returning with the warm weather, and there’s a feeling of abundance in our eateries – whether it’s a new coffee nook inside a boutique or the familiar bustle of weekend brunch on Church Street. However, not all was rosy: a beloved family restaurant in nearby Bloomfield announced an unexpected closure, a reminder that high costs and staffing challenges still **crack the shells** of even well-loved establishments. And while grocery runs are less dire than a year ago, some essentials remain pricey enough to make shoppers pause in the aisle. In short, **NUT** had its treats and trials. Montclair’s food scene remains vibrant and diverse, but behind the aroma of fresh baguettes, we know the kitchen heat of running a business is very real. We savor the good, and keep an eye on the challenges – a taste of realism in our otherwise delectable local platter.
* **LUX (Plenty & Property):** The high-end side of Montclair’s economy continued to **shine with a golden sheen**. Boutique retail and real estate are as strong as an oak. *Velvet Lush Studio’s* return exemplified this trend – the California-inspired fashion boutique reopened on North Willow with expanded offerings like fine jewelry and even an espresso bar, catering to Montclair’s taste for the chic and unique [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-11-2025/#:~:text=The%20California,shared%20with%20The%20Montclair%20Girl). Shoppers looking for that perfect spring accessory or a bit of pampering had new reasons to browse locally. In the housing market, spring listings blossomed and buyers eagerly flocked to open houses. Montclair’s homes are in such demand that the median listing price hit about **$1 million**, and many houses are still selling for well above asking price (on average *33% over list* in recent months)[realtor.com](https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Montclair_NJ/overview#:~:text=The%20median%20listing%20home%20price,on%20average%20in%20April%202025). Bidding wars in our tree-lined enclaves have become almost routine, fueled by families vying for a piece of Montclair’s charm. Even with mortgage rates higher than a few years ago, the allure of good schools, walkable streets, and cultural flair keeps the upper end of the market buzzing. **LUX**showed robust growth as a result – our town’s upscale acorns, from real estate to luxury retail, remain highly prized. Of course, that prosperity comes with a note of caution: not everyone can crack into this market, and some long-time residents feel the acorn pile getting out of reach. But for now, the luxury sector’s cup (of single-origin espresso) runneth over.
* **GRR (Green & Resilient Returns):** Montclair’s eco-conscious efforts and green initiatives bore fruit like young oak saplings. In nearby Newark, a new **“Rooted in Newark”** program planted the seeds for 5,000 new street trees over the next decade [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-4-2025/#:~:text=Eco,5%2C000%20Trees%20to%20City%20Streets) – an inspiring push for cooler, greener neighborhoods that many in Montclair cheered, knowing our own urban forest is part of a larger ecosystem. Here at home, spring rain and sunshine conspired to paint our parks the richest green; community gardens are being tilled and tended by volunteers with muddy hands and bright hopes. The township continues to promote sustainable habits – from encouraging composting and cycling to enforcing our “Skip the Stuff” rules that reduce plastic waste. Still, it’s not all sunshine: we’re mindful of climate concerns, from unpredictable weather patterns to stormwater runoff issues that need long-term planning. Yet **GRR** saw positive growth as Montclair doubled down on resilience. Every new solar panel on a roof or native tree planted in a yard adds to a quiet momentum toward sustainability. Like squirrels storing acorns for winter, Montclair is gradually preparing for a greener future, one small initiative at a time. This week, the returns on those efforts – literal and symbolic – glimmered with promise.
* **SQRL (Montclair Momentum):** The overall Montclair **squirrel index** – the spirit and momentum of our community – scampered ahead enthusiastically. All around town, one could feel a balance of industriousness and joy that defines Montclair at its best. Neighbors turned out in droves for the Walnut Street Fair and charity drives, demonstrating *commerce with a side of community*. Activists and officials came together in meetings and bike rides, showing *passion with a dose of pragmatism*. Even Montclair’s critters seemed on board – one resident swears the backyard squirrels have been especially playful, as if sensing the good vibes (or maybe just enjoying the freshly planted flowerbeds!). In essence, **SQRL** stayed strong and **spry**. Montclair’s collective momentum – that blend of creative energy, civic engagement, and quirky charm – is carrying us into the late-spring days with a full heart. If you listen closely, you can almost hear the town humming along: the gentle music of a community that knows its identity and isn’t afraid to celebrate it.

# Golden Acorn Award

**Awarded to:** *Montclair’s First Responders – our Brave Hearts of the Week.*

This week’s **Golden Acorn Award** shines on the heroes among us: the Montclair police officers and firefighters who went above and beyond the call, reminding us what community service truly means. At the Two Hundred Club’s annual Valor Awards luncheon, several of Montclair’s finest were honored for acts of extraordinary bravery [patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/valor-montclair-firefighters-police-officers-earn-awards#:~:text=MONTCLAIR%2C%20NJ%20%E2%80%94%20A%20group,Awards%20luncheon%20earlier%20this%20week)[patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/valor-montclair-firefighters-police-officers-earn-awards#:~:text=%E2%80%9CResponding%20to%20reports%20of%20an,%E2%80%9D). We want to especially recognize two remarkable incidents that could have ended in tragedy if not for their courage and skill:

* **Montclair Police Department:** Officers Michael Medrano and Stephen J. Seifried, guided by Captain Robert Romito, safely defused a volatile standoff in town, ensuring a 4-year-old child was brought out of harm’s way [patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/valor-montclair-firefighters-police-officers-earn-awards#:~:text=%E2%80%9CResponding%20to%20reports%20of%20an,%E2%80%9D). Confronted with a dangerous situation involving a firearm, these officers kept calm and used their training to protect an innocent life. Thanks to their quick thinking, a frightened child was reunited with family, unharmed – a result that earned them our deepest respect (and a standing ovation at the awards ceremony).
* **Montclair Fire Department:** On a late summer night, Montclair’s bravest performed a daring rescue at Mills Reservation. An injured hiker had become wedged between a tree and a cliff’s edge, in a precarious spot far from easy reach [patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/valor-montclair-firefighters-police-officers-earn-awards#:~:text=,and%20was%20provided%20medical%20attention). Battling darkness and steep terrain, a team of our firefighters formed a human chain of determination. They illuminated the woods with flashlights and flood lamps, rigged ropes with steady hands, and **lowered the stranded individual to safety** [patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/valor-montclair-firefighters-police-officers-earn-awards#:~:text=,and%20was%20provided%20medical%20attention). The victim, who was hurt and terrified, was delivered into awaiting medical care thanks to their perseverance. It’s the kind of rescue that could be in an action movie – except it was real, and it happened right here, carried out by our neighbors in turnout gear.

For these acts of heroism, and for the daily devotion all our first responders show (often in less dramatic but no less important ways), we award them this week’s **Golden Acorn**. They have proven, once again, that the **strongest oak of community is rooted in selfless service**. Montclair salutes you – the police, firefighters, EMTs, and all who keep us safe. Consider this a small token of our immense gratitude, a golden acorn to honor golden hearts.

# Rotten Acorn Alert

Even in a week of sunshine, **one acorn in our pile has turned up rotten** – a reminder of an ongoing challenge Montclair can’t afford to ignore. This week’s Rotten Acorn Alert goes to **our affordable housing crunch and affordability woes**. Amid the talk of prosperity, Montclair is grappling with a housing puzzle that’s growing too bitter to crack:

* **Affordable Housing Shortfall:** Montclair, like many New Jersey communities, faces a state-mandated obligation to expand or repair affordable housing – and we’re behind. A recent state report highlighted **132 housing units in town that need rehabilitation or replacement to meet affordable housing mandates** [**themontclairgirl.com**](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-4-2025/#:~:text=requiring%20municipalities%20across%20the%20state,Municipal%20Building%2C%20located%20at%20205). At the Planning Board’s May 5th hearing, residents and officials confronted this reality. The meeting brought to light stories of seniors on fixed incomes struggling to remain in town, young families unable to afford roots here, and the pressing question of where (and how) to create homes that ordinary folks can afford. It’s a complex issue years in the making, and while Montclair’s commitment to inclusivity is strong in spirit, the execution has been fraught with delays, debates, and **not-in-my-backyard headwinds**.
* **Cost of Living & Taxes:** Even beyond designated “affordable housing,” the general cost of calling Montclair home has many feeling the squeeze. Property taxes here are notoriously high, and rising assessments have some long-time residents worried about whether they can age in place. The median home price soaring above $1M [realtor.com](https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Montclair_NJ/overview#:~:text=The%20median%20listing%20home%20price,on%20average%20in%20April%202025) (as noted in LUX) means Montclair’s success is a double-edged sword – it boosts wealth for some while shutting others out. Renters, too, report that finding a reasonably priced apartment is like searching for, well, a needle in a haystack (or a perfect acorn in a drought). In our local shops and restaurants, inflation in recent years drove up prices for basics, and though inflation has cooled, those price tags haven’t exactly fallen. From housing to groceries, the **pinch is real**.

The **Rotten Acorn** here is the bitter truth that Montclair’s economic tree isn’t providing enough shade for everyone. As we applaud booming real estate and luxe boutiques, we must also address the families who worry they’ll be left behind. The good news? Awareness is growing, and so is action – that public hearing was a step, and more are planned. The challenge will be turning plans into ground-breaking and policy into practice. Until then, this issue remains the blemish on an otherwise healthy tree, the rotten acorn we’ll need to compost and turn into new growth. Montclair’s strength has always been its diversity – economic as well as cultural – and tending to that will be critical to keep our community **vibrant and just** for generations to come.

# Nut Notes: Montclair’s Microcosm in a Macro World

As we wrap up Week 6, it’s worth stepping back to see how Montclair’s **acorn economy** mirrors broader trends – a tiny oak in the vast forest of the national economy. Lately, one can’t read financial news without stumbling on talk of inflation, interest rates, and even the price of **eggs**. Just last month, U.S. inflation eased to about **2.3% year-over-year – the lowest since early 2021** [**cnbc.com**](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/cpi-inflation-breakdown-april-2025-in-one-chart.html#:~:text=The%20consumer%20price%20index%20declined,lowest%20reading%20since%20February%202021). Those once-eye-popping egg prices that had Americans clucking in dismay have finally begun to calm. In Montclair, we feel these changes in subtle ways: a dozen eggs at the farmers’ market doesn’t require a second mortgage now, and the gas pump isn’t quite as cruel as it was a year ago. Our local anecdotes – a bakery holding off on a price hike, a family deciding to dine out again – reflect that national cooling of inflation’s fever.

Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve’s moves ripple into our backyard acorns, too. Talk of steady (or even lower) interest rates is welcome news to Montclair homebuyers fatigued by rising mortgage costs, and to small business owners carrying loans. Just as **mighty oaks reflect the soil and climate around them**, Montclair’s economy absorbs the climate of the wider world. When *The New York Times* runs a story about consumer confidence ticking up, I see its echo in the morning bustle at our local café. When national reports show resilient job growth, I see “Help Wanted” signs hanging in Montclair shop windows with a bit more optimism.

The beauty of Montclair’s **nutty little index** is that it captures these connections with a whimsical wink. Our Acorn Index might be a playful local creation, but it’s rooted in real sentiments and real dollars. This week it rose gently, much like the broader markets have been cautiously hopeful amid talks of taming inflation. An acorn may be small, but given time it grows into a towering oak – and in that spirit, Montclair’s weekly story speaks to something larger. From eggs in the frying pan to acorns in the backyard, from Wall Street to Walnut Street, we’re all part of the bigger economic ecosystem.

So as you savor the spring and look forward to Montclair’s upcoming porch concerts, outdoor movies, and summer strolls, take pride that our community’s little wins and struggles resonate beyond our borders. **In each acorn is the promise of a forest**. And in Montclair’s story, we see a reflection of the American story – one of resilience, reinvention, and the pursuit of a good life, one week (and one acorn) at a time.

*Until next week, keep planting those positive seeds, Montclair!* 🌰🌱

I, being the host, had to show my comrades that I have exceptional taste, and ordered a Kopi Luwak expresso.  The next thing I know, Prescott and Bradford (old money friends) order double kopi luwak ectpressos.  I was stunned!  I know our Connecticut country club has double foie gras, or foie gras from geese only fed foie gras, but double eckpresso!?!  I never know you could get double kopi luwak beans!  They must taste twice as good as single kopi luwak beans.

I tried to talk to the chef and service staff of the resort about buying 100 or so kilograms of double kopi luwak beans, but they were all stupid and none of them spoke English.  I spoke with our concierge, but he was equally unhelpful.  He only said something like “You can’t buy double kopi luwak, you have to make it” even after I repeatedly stated that money was not an object.  I noted it and proceeded to throw him off the yacht when we left the harbor. 

Fast forward to now, none of the palm civets are eating the unroasted kopi luwak beans, even after we washed them off and coated them with double foie gras.  Barnaby, our head butler in training, has tried the French art of gavage in attempt to make double kopi luwak beans, but only succeeded in getting repeatedly bitten and likely contracting rabies.  The summer estate is now littered with dead and dying palm civets, smelly balls of foie gras and coffee beans, and coffee trees are sprouting from all the spilled kopi luwak beans from Barnaby.  Barnaby is no help after his hallucinations started, leaving everything to our head butler Wadsworth.  If I cannot find source of double kopi luwak beans, how will my friends ever know that I have exceptional taste? HELP!

Preferred Drink Type: Straight espresso for me and milk drinks for the wife
Frequency: 4 drinks per day (we also entertain guests a once a month. 6-8 people)
Space: limited on countertop space but do have space for a separate coffee bench in the kitchen. Current coffee corner is 31 inches wide and 25 inches deep.
Experience: 1-2 years
Prefer to have electric over hand grinder 
Candidates: Interested in the Profitec dual boilers for machines. Not too sure about grinders, although I would prefer a single dose. I like to experiment with all roast types while my wife prefers medium/dark.
I would like to prioritize longevity/reliability. Ease of use and easy-ish maintenance is also a plus.

Thank you in advance!

[$1,200 CAD]","So not trying to get into a holy war here, just want a little enlightenment as to what if anything I'm missing. I've gone back and forth on this and haven't really come to a definitive answer...

Here, I want to leave aside issues like aesthetics, long-term durability/reliability, usage experience and learning curve, adjustments, craft, technical elegance, etc.., and assuming a user was reasonably competent -- I'm not saying those things don't matter - but here I want to focus purely on making a really good tasting simple espresso / cappuccino. What if anything does a moderately priced PID equipped traditional machine such as the Profitec Go, Lelit Anna and similar actually do \*better\* than a Breville?

Context: We had a Breville Express for eight years, and once we got it dialed in, it made a damn nice cup with very little effort. We always use the same beans and grind so that was really straightforward. (Our prior machine had an integrated grinder and no matter what we will be buying a good quality grinder, so assume that as a given, we expect that to improve our pour regardless.) The Breville finally gave up the ghost and we are looking to replace it.

Now, I love the design and quality of the classic boiler machines. I don't mind, in fact would enjoy, spending time and putting effort into getting familiar with a machine that requires more involvement, but this isn't like .. a hobby .. for me. And so while I'd love to be able to justify one of these very cool machines, I really can't if I'm going to end up with a pour that is the same or even barely detectably better quality. (I mean, I could justify it to myself, but not in good conscience my spouse.)

What I can't see is what differences in specific design approaches and engineering quality would actually accomplish compared to a decent Breville, in terms of what actually happens to the water as it passes through the coffee on the way to your cup. In fact, there are some aspects of the Breville that seem like they could be \_better\_ wrt that than the traditional, more simple design.

Hello everyone!

First off, thank you so much for the love and support so far. Whether you’ve signed up to be a part of this, sent a kind message, or even grabbed a coffee with me to talk things through, I’m really grateful.

Sorry this update took a bit, life has been life-ing. But I wanted to share with you how the very first Queer Dinner Party went, what I’ve learned, and what’s coming up next.

To recap, the whole idea behind The Queer Dinner Party series is to bring queer folks together in smaller groups (around 8 to 10 people) for dinner and good conversation, ideally with folks who have similar interests, which I’ve been matching through the questionnaire you filled out.

The first dinner went well! We laughed, geeked out about movies/shows, and had some pretty good food. That said, I had originally sent the invite out to 14 people, assuming there would be some declines, but in the end, only two people showed up. I’m hoping a few changes I’m working on will help make turnout a bit stronger for the next one.

I also wanted to clear up a couple of things that came up. First, I realized the name ""The Queer Dinner Party"" may have been a little misleading. Sorry about that! Some people thought it was going to be a gathering over dinner at someone's place, when the original thought was to meet at a restaurant. So I guess more dinner club than dinner party.

Second, if you signed up but haven’t gotten any emails from me yet, definitely check your spam folder. It looks like emails from [TheQueerDinnerParty@gmail.com](mailto:TheQueerDinnerParty@gmail.com) might be getting filtered there. If you find one, mark it as not spam so future invites land in your inbox.

Looking ahead, I’m excited to keep things moving. We’ll still be doing dinners in small groups at restaurants, and I’ll continue matching folks based on your availability, neighborhood, and shared interests. To make things smoother, I’ll coordinate with the restaurant in advance for a prix fixe menu. That way, you’ll pay ahead of time and won’t have to stress about splitting the bill or figuring out who ordered what.

I’m planning the next round now, so keep an eye out for an invite soon. And if you signed up but don’t want to be on the list anymore, just shoot me an email at TheQueerDinnerParty@gmail.com.

Thanks again for all your support. I’m really excited to see where this goes, and I can’t wait to meet more of you soon.",1,1747353657.0,nycgaybros,0,0.67,False

They even fired our receptionist, so there's nobody to answer the phone. You can no longer call my company; it just goes to voicemail. Previously we had 1 free lunch a week provided by our employer. Now that's gone. The receptionist also maintained the kitchen, stocking our fridge with milk for coffee and providing tea and plates. Those have all run out since we don't have anyone to do it. Now we find out there's going to be a furlough starting in June. We're going to a 4 day work week with a 20 percent reduction in pay for everyone. We can get part of the loss reimbursed with our state unemployment department.

So my question is whether I need a new job? I'm lucky to have a tech job. My family is supported with my income alone. Obviously it's risky to start a new job, but I'm not sure what's gonna happen to my employer long term.

I genuinely don't know how to even *begin* describing the absolute chaos that was my ride home tonight, but I will try because I need people to understand just how profoundly upsetting this was. I'm not exaggerating when I say this one incident derailed my entire evening, wrecked my mood, and triggered what I can only describe as a minor gastrointestinal emergency. All because someone some person who clearly thinks they exist above the law, above decency, above the entire unspoken social contract decided to park an industrial-sized dump truck directly in the \*\*\*\* bike lane. Not next to it. Not near it. *In* it. Like they were trying to colonize it.

I had just finished work and was on my way home, planning to decompress with a nice steady ride across the bridge. I’d even cleaned my Paglos Helios this morning, so I was feeling optimistic. Light breeze. Legs warmed up. Music in my ears (not loud, still aware of surroundings, I know how to ride in the city). Everything was fine until, turning onto the lane near the on-ramp, I was suddenly staring into the steel reinforced backside of this mountainous, soot covered *dump truck*. Engine off. No hazards. No cones. No sign of anyone inside or nearby. Just this massive, aggressively indifferent slab of machinery, angled just slightly into the lane like it *knew* it was blocking me and didn't care.

Now, I could’ve dismounted. I could’ve shuffled my way onto the sidewalk, or even gone around into car traffic (which was its own kind of nightmare at that point, by the way). But the thing is it’s not about that. It’s the principle. I have a *lane*. A *dedicated* space. One of the few minor protections this city begrudgingly offers us two wheeled mortals. And instead of being able to use it like a normal person just trying to go home and not die in traffic, I was forced into this whole internal debate over what I value more: safety or dignity.

To make matters worse and this is where things get *very* personal my stomach had *already* been giving me subtle warnings. You know that tight, preemptive churn that suggests the body is about to file a grievance with the digestive union? That was me. And then, the added stress of this surprise urban obstacle course pushed it over the edge. I don't know what kind of psychological mechanism IBS uses to measure emotional distress, but I swear mine works with *lasers*. The moment I even *sensed* I wouldn't be getting home on time, my gut decided to become my worst enemy.

So there I was, physically blocked by a truck, mentally spiraling, and now biologically on a countdown. I circled around like three times hoping maybe the driver would show up and I could throw him a glare that would melt glass. Nothing. Nada. Just fumes, engine heat, and my own increasingly urgent need to locate a bathroom before I did something I would regret deeply and immediately.

Eventually I had to reroute—down a side street, through a pedestrian path, across some construction zone that may or may not have been legally accessible, and into a deli that saved my life, though their bathroom was terrifying and the door didn’t lock. Don’t ask. I still haven’t emotionally recovered.

Anyway, I did make it across the bridge. But not with peace in my heart. Not with the endorphin glow I usually get. No, I arrived with the hollow, joyless gaze of a man who was wronged by infrastructure. I genuinely don’t know how people tolerate this. Or more accurately—I do know, because I see it every single day, and somehow we just… keep going. But today I hit my limit. And I’m still mad about it.

To the dump truck driver: I hope your coffee was cold, your boss was annoying, and you step in something gross while wearing nice shoes. Maybe then you’ll think twice before turning the bike lane into your personal parking space.

Ray and I exchanged ig handles in class and I was hesitant at first but thought ‘hey why not what if I miss a day of class etc. ‘ over the week we simply talked about class then he started making small talk and I would reply and I’d say we texted for a week ish only and I would stop replying and he’d just text again talking about the hw. We had also gone out for coffee to work on our homework(at this point I was struggling so I needed all the help I could get and didn’t think much of it). It wasn’t until we walked out of class and he asked if I wanted a rose since it was around Valentine’s Day and they were selling candy grams and roses. I said no thank you and that’s when it clicked like oh this guy is into me and he just started showing up almost everywhere and he is very pushy like once he asked if I wanted to get lunch after class and I said no and he kept pushing it and was even like well what if I bring you food then. I was honestly getting annoyed like he would just not take a hint. He finally messaged me saying he thought I was pretty what not and I declined his offer. 

By that time I had left my classes and went MIA due to personal reasons. I posted a story I guess like announcing my comeback after going MIA and he slid up and we just caught up and at this point I was desperate for a job so he got me a job with him. I took the offer and started working there and everything was fine I was like okay he’s chill but over time I started to get annoyed he is very pushy like I said and talks nonstop. But that was something I could look over until recently within the past couple of months I started noticing a change in behavior where he almost seems possessive or controlling over me. Mind you I have never said anything to make him think that I am into him I’m simply just nice. He had started making little flirty comments which I didn’t like and one time we had gone out with a friend, he asked me if I was ready to leave (we  all came separately), like why do I have to leave when he wants to like it felt possessive and I did NOT like that in fact it pissed me off. This other time which was recent we went out as a group and he seemed super bothered that I was texting other people and mind you WERE JUST FRIENDS. 

This most recent incident almost broke the friendship so we had gone out I had gotten with his friend and he got super mad and cut off the friend  and scolded me for doing that and basically confessed his feelings to me and said I need to do better and said how can I have a crush on someone (earlier that night I told him I liked someone) and then go out and do that and it’s like why do I have to be loyal to a crush? It’s just a crush and plus I AM SINGLE I can do as I please and it just felt a little manipulative and it felt like the minute I didn’t fit this image he created of me that I was in the wrong. And I apologized because I unintentionally hurt his feelings right and told him like we’re just friends and that’s all it’s going to be. And over the week I started to reevaluate everything and his reaction to that specific incident with his friend and I honestly don’t know what to do. Don’t get me wrong he is very nice and has been a great friend but I just think he’s gotten a little too controlling and possessive and it feels like he inserts himself into my life anyway he can and he asked to hang out with me because he said it would do us good after what happened with his friend but I genuinely don’t want to. I told him I’d let him know but I don’t know what to do anymore and I don’t know if I’m in the wrong for thinking like this or what.",1,1747353248.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I'll be living in Redwood Heights, so not exactly in the heart of Oakland, but I'll have my car and my bike, and would love to know what I shouldn't miss during my visit!! I love gardens, low-key hiking (bad knees), dancing, breweries, coffee shops, bookstores and museums. I've spent plenty of time in sf, and zero time in the east bay, so I'm really excited to get to know the area! Hoping to get around on my bike more than anything, if it's a pretty chill area to bike around. 

I'll also have a lot of down time, and would love to volunteer some time somewhere extra hands might be needed once or twice a week. Obviously can't commit to anything long term or anything that would require a lot of training, but it seems like there are cleanup days I could jump in on? I'm fairly strong and good at following orders!

I'm 32F and I'll be on my own, so would love to hear about any fun chill events that welcome newcomers too! June 9 - June 28 is the date range, if that helps. ",3,1747352865.0,oakland,1,1.0,False

1knmwkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1knmwkg/bad_reaction_to_ltheanine_my_experience/,Bad reaction to L-theanine - My experience,"Hi everyone,

  
I know L-theanine is widely praised in this community — and for good reason in many cases — but I wanted to share my experience in case it resonates with anyone who may have had an unexpected or negative reaction like I did.

**Background:**  
24M, high-stress job.  
Back in November 2024, I started supplementing with GABA (750 mg daily in the evenings). It noticeably helped with evening relaxation, reduced mental chatter, and made it easier to sleep. I used it consistently for around 2 months without any negative side effects.

In January 2025, I decided to switch to L-theanine (200 mg/day, brand: Aliness), based on its reputation for promoting calmness and modulating glutamate without the questionable bioavailability concerns of GABA.

**However — and this is where things went wrong:**  
After just a few days on L-theanine, I started experiencing sudden and unexplained **derealization, dissociation, anxiety, and emotional numbness/anhedonia**. It got a little better after that but still felt ""weird"". I didn’t connect it to L-theanine at first and kept taking it for nearly 2 months.

The reason I kept taking it — even though something clearly felt off — is because at the time, it actually *helped* me function at work in a weird way. It made me more emotionally blunt and detached which I thought was better than dealing with everyday stress. I could just ""autopilot"" my day without a care.

I had this strange sense that it was suppressing all my anxiety artificially, and that it was all going to come back eventually… but I didn’t care. That numb detachment made it easier to handle my stressful job — I just stopped reacting to anything.

But about two months in, something snapped.

**One day at work**, I suddenly started experiencing some terrifying symptoms. It felt like I had “greened out” on weed — like I was *high*, but not in any pleasant sense. Everything around me felt alien.

  
I don’t even know if it was a panic attack, because of lack of tachycardia (or maybe I just didn't feel it at the time, not sure) or something else, but I became *severely* anxious and dissociated. 

I had to go hide away from people just to ride it out. It felt like existential distortion of the logic that flows into concepts of what's real. I felt a heavy dissolution of reality and all meaning and it's like I'm still rebuilding some details of my mental faculties if that makes any sense. 

My mind was looping — like a fever dream. I was thinking it could be a serotonine syndrome but it honestly felt like ego death...

After that day, I immediately stopped taking L-theanine. The symptoms actually got *worse* for a while after quitting. I had a panic attack after drinking coffee - which I never had before (and which is why I stopped drinking coffee for 2½ months.)

After a few days symptoms slooowly started to fade - only coming back in a stressful situations.

**One month later**, I started sertraline (e.g. Zooloft - named differently in my country, currently 75 mg) and trazodone (50 mg) under psychiatric guidance — and almost immediately the same symptoms came back in full: anxiety, overstimulation, agitation, intrusive thoughts, tension. It felt like the same system that was disrupted by L-theanine got triggered again.

**My theory (based on a lot of reading and some guesswork):**

L-theanine isn’t just “green tea calm in a capsule.” It modulates **glutamate** and **glutamine** levels in the brain — potentially *increasing* glutamate uptake or acting differently in those with sensitive or already imbalanced systems.  
My suspicion is that after 2 months of GABA supplementation (possibly downregulating excitatory activity), the switch to L-theanine pushed my glutamatergic system into chaos.

Once that system was destabilized, I became hypersensitive — even SSRIs (which also affect glutamate in addition to serotonin) seemed to re-trigger the same symptoms.

I understand this might sound unlikely to some, especially to those who’ve had great results with L-theanine — but I think it’s important we don’t assume that just because a supplement is “generally safe,” it works the same for everyone.

**I’d love to hear from anyone who’s had a similar experience with L-theanine, or who has any insight into glutamate/GABA imbalance triggered by supplements.** This has been a tough and confusing journey - I'm still trying to make sense of what happened, and I’d really appreciate any shared perspectives.

Thanks.

**TL;DR:**  
GABA helped for 2 months → switched to L-theanine (200 mg) → developed derealization, anxiety, dissociation.  
Kept taking it because it made me emotionally blunt and helped me function at work.  
After 2 months, had a scary breakdown at work — extreme dissociation, loopy thinking, thought I had serotonin syndrome.  
Stopped L-theanine, symptoms worsened briefly, then lingered.  
A month later, SSRIs triggered the same symptoms again.",5,1747352668.0,Supplements,2,0.86,False

I have 3 major gripes. Piss poor customer service, a small selection, and exorbitant prices.

These businesses tend to have skeleton crews or just one employee at the register. For restaurants, cafes, etc this just leads to slow and poor service. For places with one employee god forbid you need help and there’s more than one customer. I’ve been told to wait for customers to filter out so they can come help or come back later.

For selection it’s always oh if you want that we can order it for you for a fee and you can come grab it. Or I can go on Amazon and get it tomorrow. 

Prices, sure you CAN charge me $7 for a fucking muffin but don’t act all surprised and go on a social media campaign about how your business is failing because “no one wants to support small businesses” Bro not even evil ass Starbucks has the audacity to charge me $7 for a muffin.

This coffee shop, and a few more experiences I don’t want to type more paragraphs about I’ve started seeing small businesses as places where I’m going to be ignored, they’re not gonna have what I need or want, and even if they do it’s going to be uncharged by a fair amount compared to big evil corporations. 

Small business margins are smaller yada yada. I don’t care, I’m a consumer. I know jackshit about business. YOU are the business owner here. Okay you have to up charge a little, but when your prices are noticeably higher than Walmart, Home Depot, fucking Starbucks of all places. Why would I waste money there?

I don’t care at this point. You can charge what you want and I’ll go where I want, but this woe is me no one wants to support small businesses shit is annoying to look at.

Whenever I see that a small business closed down in my heart of hearts I know it boils down to these 3 reasons why your business failed/is failing and you want to put the blame on consumers and I’m sick of it.",71,1747352479.0,unpopularopinion,53,0.84,False

Previously I was on Desoxyn and taking it 3-4 times a day as needed and I didn't really worry too much about whether I was taking it with food. In fact one of my favorite things was to set an early alarm and take my first pill about an hour before I had to wake up.

Anyways, now that I'm limited to one pill a day I really want to establish a good pattern that will make it work right. The problem is I don't really have much control around what time breakfast is served and it ends up varying by about 2 hours from day to day.

So I'm wondering, what do you think the minimum viable breakfast is to get consistency out of an ER pill? My thought was to have a Chobani yogurt drink first thing at 6:00am as my ""take with a meal"" and then see how I feel about whatever else is for breakfast between 7 and 9 (usually a muffin, a piece of bacon, a cup of berries and a cup of coffee)

Our dynamic is unique as we hide our relationship from our work place besides 2 of our closest colleagues. 

I've been looking forward to this weekend for the last 2 weeks as we only spend one whole weekend a month together (with the exception of special occasions and events). Last night I texted him asking if he wanted me to go to his straight after work to get ready and have pre drinks, or if he wanted to meet me at the venue and expressing my excitement. I received no response, however that's not out of character for him as he's not super glued to his phone and I know he goes to bed early due to the physical demand of our job. 

This morning we spent the first couple of hours flirting when walking past our work stations, after I finally had a coffee I went up to him to ask when the band he wanted to see starts. He stops making eye contact with me and starts mumbling that he never bought the tickets and had forgotten about it entirely. That when he saw my msg last night and ones from his brother in law asking about it, he had only realised it was tonight. 

I got no apology, no explanation as to why he couldn't communicate that to me last night, no offer to buy tickets now or an alternative solution to spend time together. He just put his head down, kept working and was clearly avoiding any further conversation on the topic. 

I'm really struggling to put into words to let him know how this rejection, lack of communication and poor handling of this situation has made me feel. I honestly walked away fighting back tears because I felt crushed and couldn't say anything right then and there due to trying to be professional in our work environment.  

This isn't a total deal breaker for me, but I do feel I need to address how this has left me feeling icky and sad.

TLDR: partner told me he was buying tickets to a gig. Didn't communicate to me that he forgot when I asked what the plan was. Didn't offer an apology or an alternative solution and chose to just avoid me instead. ",3,1747352281.0,polyamory,7,1.0,False

(A Letter You’ll Never Read)

We never made it past the talking stage,
No titles, no claims, just lines on a page.
But God, I memorized your every word,
Even the ones you swore I never heard.

You’d message late, and I’d always reply,
Heart racing fast like a hummingbird’s cry.
I’d reread your texts like holy prose,
Like something sacred nobody knows.

And in that space, that in-between,
Where “almost” hides and “what ifs” lean,
I built a world from scraps and sighs—
A home in the color of your eyes.

I told myself, “Don’t fall, not yet,”
But my heart tripped over every text you sent.
You called me “friend,” and I played along,
While writing sonnets in silence all night long.

You said, “I love talking to you, you’re sweet,”
And I smiled while dying beneath the seat.
You leaned on me when your skies turned grey,
Not knowing I’d give my soul away.

I kept my feelings wrapped in lace,
Carefully hidden behind my face.
Because what if I said, “I want you more,”
And you walked out, slammed the door?

So I stayed still, in soft retreat,
Carving love in lines discreet.
Loving you in lowercase,
While you chased hearts in other places.

Then came the blow—gentle and cruel:
“You’re a friend—my golden rule.”
And my world, it cracked, but I just laughed,
Told you, “That’s fine,” while I broke in half.

I held your secrets, caught your tears,
Stayed your constant through the years.
While every smile you gave away
Was a needle that made me stay.

I loved you like a quiet art,
In midnight letters torn apart.
I kissed your name with every line,
In hopes you’d see the love was mine.

But you never did, or never will—
You’re chasing dreams, I’m standing still.
And though you never crossed that line,
You lived in every poem of mine.

Still, I can’t unlove you—I’ve tried.
I’ve yelled, I’ve cried, I’ve kept it inside.
But every time I try to flee,
Some piece of you still clings to me.

You’re etched in places I can’t clean,
In coffee cups and movie scenes.
In songs I skip but never delete,
In empty corners of my sheets.

So now I write, like fools before,
Who loved too hard, and hoped for more.
You’ll never read these pages torn,
These midnight thoughts where dreams are born.

But if you do—if fate allows,
If stars align and time somehow
Brings you across this fragile trail
Of broken hearts and hopeful mail—

You’ll see the truth I dared not speak:
You were the high I couldn’t reach.
You were the sun behind my shade,
The almost-love that never stayed.

I won’t confess it face to face.
I’ll love you from a safer place.
A distant moon, a watching star—
Not too close, but never far.

So here’s my vow, without a name:
I’ll keep on loving you the same.
From friend to ghost, from real to art,
Forever yours, in secret—heart.",24,1747352224.0,UnsentLetters,8,1.0,False

I'm just curious if anybody else has experienced anything similar, or if anybody might have a physiologic or pharmacologic explanation.

I just turned 50. Because polyps run in my family, I have been having regular five-year colonoscopies, starting at age 40. This week, I asked my anesthetist if he could add a little ketamine to the sedation protocol.  He agreed.

I took a shower that evening, after I got home and had a nap. (Those of you who have undergone colonoscopies understand that the prep keeps you from a restful night's sleep the night before.)  Usually, in the shower I can close my eyes, let the warm water run over my scalp and shoulders, and I see stars for about 30 seconds.  It's nice.  It's almost like a visual accompaniment to the tingly sensation of a nice warm shower.  But yesterday, no stars.  

I thought about any number of explanations--not the least of which is that I typically shower while it is still dark in the morning, and after a decent night's rest.  Well, this morning: same thing.  Less tingly warmth from the shower, and no stars.

Is this sensation familiar to anyone?  (I tried to get Google to help me describe the stars I'm seeing.  It's not exactly phosphenes (which I can still get if I push against my eyes).  It might be what I am describing is also known as closed eye visualizations (CEV) or closed eye hallucinations.)

I usually prefer to spend time with the kids after dinner before bedtime, so I will do them either after everyone gets to bed or in the morning when I am making coffee.  Either way, they will get done.  And if for some reason it doesn't get done by me before we both go to work, our housekeepers that I hired come twice a week or nanny (weekdays) will get them done so they are definitely not piling up and my wife still comes home to a clean kitchen.   But the thought of dirty dishes stresses her out so immediately after dinner she will start complaining and ""angry cleaning"" and doing the dishes in a pissed off manner.  Sometimes she even starts cleaning them before we eat which just delays dinner.

What's the right way of dealing with it? Telling her that I will do it later seems to enrage her.  And I don't want to stop spending time with the kids to take care of something that could clearly wait.    If I jump in to do them, is that just enabling her OCD further?   Is there a way to get her to ""let it go"" and enjoy the short period before kids' bedtime or is that a losing battle?

People never noticed him.
Not because he was quiet—he just… never stumbled.
He crossed streets while others waited.
He got hired for jobs he didn’t apply for.
He once missed a plane that later crashed, and complained more about the airport coffee.

No one ever saw him suffer.
Not in pain. Not in panic. Not in loss.

He wasn’t rich, but money appeared when needed.
He wasn’t a genius, yet always knew just enough.
He never won the lottery. Why would he?
That would be too obvious.

He didn’t chase women.
They’d simply appear—ones who left just in time before they could break his heart,
and ones who stayed only when they were aligned with his path.

People thought it was charm. Confidence.
No.
It was the quiet hum of the universe saying:
“Not this one.”

One time, a mugger held a knife to his throat.
The mugger’s arm cramped mid-threat. He dropped the knife and apologized.
They had coffee afterward. The mugger turned himself in the next morning.

Another time, a car skidded toward him at 140 km/h.
The tire blew. The car spun and stopped half a meter away.
The driver fainted. He kept walking.

He was asked once:
“What’s your secret?”

He smiled.

> “I guess I just get lucky.”



But deep inside, he knew.
The world was wired differently for him.
Mistakes became miracles.
Time rearranged itself in silence.
Death walked behind him, never beside.

Some say he made a deal.
Others whisper he’s a glitch in fate.

But the truth?

He never asked for power.
He just made one wish as a child:

There’s a news story circulating right now about Starbucks workers who are legitimately protesting and organizing because they were told they have to wear a neutral-colored t-shirt under their apron and they can’t wear yoga pants or sweatpants. They unironically view this is a violation of their rights as workers.

I understand that the unionizing is responsible for this and I’m not inherently against unionizing, but… it just gets to a point. And spare me the “uNiOnS aRe WhY wE hAvE eVeRyThiNg!” speech because I just specifically stated that I’m not inherently anti-union. In fact, I think the teachers unions specifically should be really holding the system’s feet to the fire at this point in time and support them in doing so.

No one is saying Starbucks workers deserve to be paid scraps or starve to death but it would be nice to see them exercise a bit of self-awareness and be reminded that they’re brewing coffee and not performing complex brain surgeries that society is reliant on them to perform. They are fast food workers who receive extremely generous benefits for what they actually bring to the table and all they do is complain.

""In need of money? Having a tough time in this game we call life? Watch my animals. For a week, maybe less, as of right now I'm unsure of how long I'll be gone. Job pays 3000 dollars. 10 cats, 7 dogs and a pin of pigs. Food and booze are included. More details on phone if your serious about this.""

The last part included the phone number to call.
Wow. I thought.
Watch some animals for a week for 3k? 
That sounds like easy money. Too easy.

I'll call the number, but I don't expect to get the job. But then after the rush from the pay calmed, I realised that the location was undisclosed. The post did say more details over the phone. And when I called, the man who answered the phone, also answered all my questions. He said his name was vore. 

Its far. Really far from the town it was posted in, about a 4 hour drive, out in the deep country of Michigan. As there was no stores or gas station near his home, he offered to refill my gas when I got there, as he had according to him, plenty of the stuff on the property I could use to refill my car. On the phone, the man was still unsure how long he will be gone. But he assured me it wouldn't be longer than a week.

So. A week at the most, with food, gas and even alcohol thrown into the mix, for a nice payout just to watch and care for some cats, dogs And a few pigs. All for a solid 3000 dollars? I was of course ready and willing to do this. He said only a few called but turned the offer down because it was so far away. But not for me. Not for a few grand and a different set of mind that I could experience.

 
My life has been on autopilot for weeks since she left. It was a good thing for me to mix things up. I mean I miss the woods, and the country. So I guess you could say I was very excited for this small adventure in my life, i can't wait to meet all of the animals. 




The road seemed to keep stretching as I drove, no turns for the last two hours, just tree's left and right. but I knew it was the right road and direction. So I kept on driving. Gas is under a quarter of a tank. He better have that gas he talked about (even though I brought my own full can just incase.)

 The skies were darkening, and the tempature dropping steadily, it was the middle of April, and the forecast said tempature drops tonight to 45° with thunderstorms around 7:30 8:00 and stretch possibly into the morning. But that was the forecast from home. As the sun dropped, I couldn't help but feel uneasy as I kept driving through these dark dank freaky twisted woods. 

""Cmon, how much farther is this place?""
I exclaimed to myself, starting to get irritated after being on the road for so long.  

While driving, the land was still lit up enough to see decently into the woods, but farther back, left and right, it seeped darkness. Like the shadow of the woods was ready to consume it but the sun halted it's endeavor, for now. Soon the dark will have it's turn, and the dark will roll, and hopefully I can get there before that happens.


Some time later, Driving down the dark dirt road, only headlights shining the way, the blur of a white splotchy light creeped through the twigs and showing a bright light casting through the trees. when I pulled up to the property, relief settled in as I finally made it. 

While slowly turning into the short drive, vore, stood tall in front of a big tree. Right at the end of the short driveway. He had one hand up in a greeting posture and another in his pocket, with squinted eyes, he waved his hand a bit. I didn't expect him to be waiting outside in the dark for me. Kinda weird I thought, but moved passed it quickly. 

After parking and stepping put of my truck, it was time to meet vore face to face. 

""You finally made it!""
""Haha, I thought you got lost out there in those woods."" Vore said as he reached down on the ground and picked up a lantern. Switching it on, it was a powerful light.

Vore was pretty tall, around 6'3. And his hair was scraggly and black. Shoulder length. He was wearing a black shirt covered by an unbuttoned worn down red and black checkered flannel with blue jeans and a ball cap on backwards. Noticeably, he had a big shiny wedding ring on his ring finger that held the lantern.


""Well it was one road for miles, so I knew I was on the right track. Nice to meet you.""


""Nice to meet ya too, I reckon, your a bit tired after all that driving now.""
After we shook hands, vore fiddled with the lantern and the light receded a bit. 

""Yeah I have never drove this far ever in my life with no stops. It's pretty draining.""

""I see, Well let's head up to the house.""

There was no mistaking the home here, it wasn't a house it was a trailer. Which did take me by surprise. The light I seen was actually from the shed right behind the trailer, must have glowed through the window. As he lead me to the front porch, I could feel the temperature drop more. It's getting colder and later in the night, it's normal. But for some reason, I felt it was heavier in this moment. 


As we walked into the front door, vore turned some lights on. we were immediately in the living room and to my right, he aimed me to the kitchen which was the end of the front of the trailer. 
He motioned for me to sit at the table. So I did. I noticed multiple cats infesting the living room and kitchen as he kept Turning lights on.

""Alright first of all, thank you for doing this for me, I had quite a some trouble trying to find someone to help me.""

""No problem, thank you for the job, 3k is alot of doe, so thank you. 

""Your welcome, now let me inform ya what needs to be done around here.""


I sat there just waiting for the list of jobs, and vore walked around the table and sat across from me. Straight to business I guess. 


""Okay here's the list of things i want you to aquire while I'm gone. And the stuff that needs done as well of course.""

Aquire?


""Take care of my animals first and foremost. Right? I mean, who doesn't love their animals especially if they have 20 of em? make sure they eat, and get water everyday, right when you wake up. Then feed em again later on around 1 or 2 then finally once more in the evening. As for the pigs, that old broke down Truck back there in the backyard has loaves of bread in it.""

""Tailgate is locked, but the key and others I got I left on the coffee table there all on a ring. Give each pig two loafs twice a day. The secondary job is just water my weed plants. There are 3 of them. Two behind the trailer 1 in front across the road.  I'll show ya where they are exactly before I leave.""

""You said something about acquiring? You didn't mention that on the phone."" 

""Yeah I'm sorry bout that, it's nothing big just need ya to take the road up they way you didn't come and you will see a clearing with some fences. Inside those fences are a big ol pile of wood you can't miss it. I need you to haul back this wood and store it behind the shed in the backyard.""

""The county sold it to me last week and I haven't had the time to get it. I was gonna offer ya to use my tractor and trailer. But you can use ur truck if you rather. Remember I got gas in the shed as well.""

""Oh okay well how long does it take to get there?""

""About 10 minutes. Might take you 2 trips though it's a decent pile of wood, but the other thing I need you to get is not gonna be ready until Wednesday. I got a guy other side of them woods behind the trailer that owes me something. Now he's old and don't get out much so your gonna have to go an get it.""

""Don't worry about what it is aint nothing illegal I can assure you but It needs to be picked up sometime on Wednesday. Make sure you do not forget it. There's a trail back there the only one,  you just follow it and it will lead to his house.""

I was distracted by a couple cats in the living room that were playing and running around, while the others just watched. My gaze turned from them to vore and I just nodded my head. He stared at me for a few seconds and flashed a crooked smile. 

""So I reckon you can handle all of that then? He stood up and pinned the piece of paper to the refrigerator with a ham magnet. Like the type of delicious looking ham you see in the cartoons. 

""Umm yeah it all seems straight forward.""

""Good Good, food in the fridge of course and that booze I talked about is right there on the counter. Its a whole liter of whiskey now so dont get too drunk and burn my place down ya hear?""

We both shared a laugh but it was short lived as quickly stopped and started looking at me seriously, analyzing me. 

""But seriously I come back and this place is burnt down to the ground or if anyone of my animals is hurt, or dies.... well best not to get into that, I'm sure you'll do fine.

That was strange, I get where he's coming from but I'm almost 30 man I not gonna burn down the property or kill any of your animals. Just a weird shift in conversation that quickly turned kinda dark. After a few seconds of silence, he spoke again.

""Speaking of animals, this little boy right here is the light of my life, his name is roscoe.""

A little lap dog pomeranian ran up to him as he picked him up. 

""Please take extra care of him, I found this sucker 1 year ago on the road while I was traveling. He was lost and scared shitless. But now he's as happy as ever.""

""Of course vore all your animals will be well taken care of, I really love animals myself it's another reason why I took this job honestly.""

""Yeah that's good, the other ones must be sleeping somewhere I don't see em, but their name is Lucy and stifler, Lucy is a pomeranian too and stifler is a terrier.""

""Its alot of animals you got here, it's gonna be kinda hard to get all there names right.""

""No worries, over there on the that shelf Is a book of photos with them and their names. So if you wanna learn em there ya go.""

""Oh alright that's cool, thanks.""

""Now last thing, down the hall is the bedroom then bathroom. But if you wanna wanna kick it on that couch I don't give a damn what you do, but just leave my room alone. It's locked anyways. So don't even think about trying to get in there.""

""Oh of course I won't even touch the handle you don't have to worry one bit.""

""Good""

""my cell number is on that fridge too, if you need to try to get ahold of me, now I'll be on the road alot so I'm not sure if I'll always have reception.""
 
It seems it started sprinkling outside, the tiny raindrops slowly and sporadically tapping on the roof, outside the kitchen window, lighting flashed and a few seconds later thunder slighted rumbled in the distance. As vore stood up he grabbed a duffle bag on the couch and told me one last thing. 

""So we may be out in tha middle of no man's land here, and not many come driving through here too, but if anything out of the ordinary or a possibly dangerous situation does occur, I have a shotgun in that gun case there.""

He pointed and nodded with his head in the corner of the loving room. 

""It's unlocked and the gun is loaded with a few extra shells inside the case. But as I said No one really comes around here, you should be all alone for the next 3 to 7 days.""

""That does ease my mind, I gotta say it's pretty creepy all the way out here.""

""Haha that it is, we're out deep in tha sticks here chance, but I'm sure you'll do just fine.""

1knmk0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1knmk0u/is_dialog_gaming_data_the_biggest_scam_out_there/,"Is Dialog Gaming Data the Biggest Scam Out There? (i think i had too much coffee, i had to use excel)","Link: [https://www.dialog.lk/home-broadband/postpaid/addon/gaming-data-plans?id=304&language=en](https://www.dialog.lk/home-broadband/postpaid/addon/gaming-data-plans?id=304&language=en)

Let’s cut the chase bois. Dialog is selling these “**Gamer Lite Add-On Packs**” that look like they’re built for gamers. But they’re **one of the most misleading data bundles in Sri Lanka (maybe out of all the scummy packages ISPs out there are selling)**, especially if you don’t understand how data priorities and types actually work.

Let’s take the **Rs.5,333 plan** the highest tier.

# What You Get:

* **160GB Gaming Data**
* **30GB Anytime Data**
* **Valid for 30 days**
* **One-time use (no auto-renew)**

At first glance, you think:

>“190GB for 5K? Not bad. I can download a few big games, play online, stream some Twitch, no stress.”

# Wrong.

# Its a hidden trap What's the Difference Between ""Gaming Data"" and ""Anytime Data""?

Let’s break it down:

|**Type of Data**|**What It Covers**|**Used For**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Gaming Data**|ONLY covers whitelisted gaming traffic during gameplay|Playing PUBG, COD, Dota 2 nothing else|
|**Anytime Data**|Covers EVERYTHING downloads, updates, store pages, videos, Discord, social media|Downloading games, updating, browsing, streaming, etc. (steam and Epic)|

>**Remember**: Gaming Data ≠ All Gaming-Related Stuff, It’s just your connection while you’re already inside the game — NOT the stuff you do before that (installing, updating, watching gameplay videos, etc.)

# Dialog whitelists certain game server IPs and protocols like:

* Riot Games
* Steam multiplayer servers
* Blizzard matchmaking
* Epic Games live servers **BUT NOT the content delivery networks (CDNs)** that host:
   * Game files
   * Updates
   * Patches
   * Launcher UI traffic
   * Storefronts

This means **Steam content servers (CDN.steampowered.com)**, **PlayStation/Nintendo update servers**, **Google Play**, and **App Store** all fall under **Anytime Data**, NOT Gaming Data.

# Here's a scenario for you if its hard for you to wrap your mind around what I just explained above:

You bought the Rs.5,333 pack. You now have:

* 160GB for playing games online
* 30GB for literally everything else

Let’s say you:

* Download **Red Dead Redemption 2** – **120GB**
* Install **Call of Duty: Warzone** – **110GB**
* Run a few patches and updates for Apex and Valorant – **20GB**
* Browse Discord, YouTube trailers, download a mod – **5GB**

**Total: \~255GB of real usage, all from Anytime Data.**

You only had 30GB for this. You’re now **225GB in the red.**

Dialog either:

* Blocks your traffic
* Forces you to buy more data
* Or activates Pay-As-You-Go charges (ultra expensive)

Meanwhile, your **160GB of Gaming Data? Untouched.** Sitting there unused like a gym subscription in December.

# Simplified Breakdown for Non-Tech Guys and Gals:

* **Gaming Data = only used while you're inside a match, running and shooting.**
* **Anytime Data = used for downloading, updating, installing, and watching.**

If you:

* Install PUBG = uses **Anytime Data**
* Update PUBG = uses **Anytime Data**
* Open PUBG and play = uses **Gaming Data**
* Watch PUBG YouTube videos = **Anytime Data**
* Join Discord while playing = **Anytime Data**
* Update the game tomorrow = **Anytime Data again**

# What’s the Catch?

Dialog **sells big numbers (160GB Gaming)** to sound impressive. But for most gamers especially those who play on PC or consoles **90% of your traffic is actually downloads and updates.** So you're burning through the tiny 30GB Anytime quota fast.

# Let’s Put This in Ratio:

|**Plan Price**|**Gaming Data**|**Anytime Data**|**% Actually Usable for Downloads**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Rs.653|14GB|6GB|Only 6GB usable for downloads|
|Rs.1,334|34GB|11GB|Only 11GB usable for downloads|
|Rs.1,876|50GB|15GB|Only 15GB usable for downloads|
|Rs.4,036|115GB|25GB|Only 25GB usable for downloads|
|Rs.5,333|160GB|30GB|Only 30GB usable for downloads|

**In short:** You’re paying **5K+** for **30GB** of real usable data unless all you do is log in and play Valorant 12 hours a day with zero updates.

This isn’t a gamer-friendly plan it’s a **half-useful marketing trick**. For actual modern gaming, especially on PC or console, you need:

* Downloads
* Updates
* Launchers
* Background services

These packs cover none of that with their “Gaming Data.”

If you’re a real gamer, you’re better off with a **base plan with a high Anytime quota** or Dialog should just be transparent and stop calling it “Gamer Lite.” More like **“Online Match Only Lite.”**

# TL;DR (for the ADHD Ma Bois):

Dialog’s “Gamer Data” is only for playing, not downloading. You can’t install or update your games with the 160GB. You’ll burn through the small 30GB Anytime Data in hours, then get charged more. It’s not worth it unless you *only* play one game every day and never download anything.",1,1747351643.0,srilanka,0,1.0,False

1knmhk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1knmhk4/its_never_enough/,It’s never enough,"My mum has vascular dementia, it’s been about 5 years and it’s progressively fairly swiftly.
She lives with my Step father. I’m an only child and he has no kids of his own. They have been together since I was 3 so he is practically a Dad. A few years ago, we decided that it would be a good idea for them to sell their house and buy a new one closer to us so we could provide more support and they can see their grandchildren more.
Since then, we have them around for dinner 1 or two times per week, as well as a coffee or lunch a couple  of days per week. I try and help practically as well - buying her clothes, finding doctors and services and sending them to my step dad (he wants to make all the decisions). It took me ages to get him to agree to home services and now when he desperately needs it he’s complaining it’s taking too long even though for years I’ve been trying to organise…now it’s all my fault it’s on him and he’s stressed.
Recently, he’s become extremely angry at me for not having them around twice to a week for champagne and dinner even though I’ve said once a week for drinks is better for us with other catch ups in the morning or lunch. We are either working late or have kids activities and sitting around drinking for hours is not fun for me.
Recently we took them on a paid holiday to Fiji. For a week or endless time spent all together.
Yesterday, when I mentioned my various health issues he got angry and insisted the focus be on my Mum. My Dad who lives alone and about an hour away and is an alcoholic on deaths door with hospital admissions every few days I cannot talk about as he gets angry when I’m helping my Dad and not focusing on them.
My point is, I feel so upset and angry. They live so close, we see them multiple times a week. It’s never enough. I have 3 children, my business which I work in 24/7 supports my family. At his age, he was living far away from his elderly parents doing not much. Why is there such a double standard. 
The selfish, mean qualities of this man are showing and in the past my Mum was able to keep him reasonable but she obviously cannot do that anymore. He even refuses to take his shoes off at the door of our house and drags mud through our house. There is no respect.
He scoffed the other day that he didn’t think I should get all the money when they die. It was so hurtful and I didn’t know what to say. He’s so nasty.
Please tell me, should I just give in and have them over every night for their champagne. Am I being selfish?

1knme48,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1knme48/lets_talk_thermal_deformation/,Let's talk thermal deformation,"It's well known that, over time, Aeropress brewers warp due to the expansion and contraction associated with having hot water poured into them, which makes the filter holder more difficult to twist onto the brewer body. The Aeropress used to be my favourite brewing technique (I only switched away from it because, with worsening caffeine addiction, I need a bigger coffee in the morning than I can make out of an Aeropress, but I still often use it for my afternoon coffee), so perhaps my brewers warped faster than other people's did, but a quick search of this subreddit shows that other people have experienced it.

It seems that, in people's experience, the problem is most pronounced:

a. with the Aeropress Go (seems expected that with the smaller mass of plastic, thermal deformation will occur faster), and

b. when using the inverted method (which also seems logical as you're trying to put the filter cap on after the mouth of the brewer has expanded from contact with hot water).

However, this is a problem that affects every Aeropress (except presumably the Premium, since glass won't expand as much, although the steel filter holder will). My regular-sized Aeropress is the 4th I've owned, and it is currently so deformed that it is difficult even to twist off the filter holder when the brewer is cold (though not nearly as difficult as it is to twist it on when it's hot). I've owned my current one since 2022 or so, and the one before that since 2018. The latter had become practically unusable because I needed so much force to twist the cap on and off (even when cold) that I was risking scalding myself when doing it when it was full of hot water. The current one is gradually heading that way too, but I will never forget how excited I was when I got it and realised how much easier it was to take the cap on and off than the previous one!

The one I owned before 2018 I threw away because it spent several months in storage and there was mould in it when I got hold of it again, despite my having washed it thoroughly before putting it in storage. I honestly don't remember how difficult it was to get the cap on and off that one.

However, I owned one Aeropress before the mouldy one too: an original Aeropress I bought very early on, probably 2007ish, before they went BPA-free. I used that for far longer than any of the BPA-free brewers that I owned without noticing any similar problems with thermal deformation, at least not to the same extent!

So, to review what I've been able to figure out:

a. The problem most likely affects the brewer body, not the filter cap. I conclude this from the fact that, when trying to fit the filter cap onto the brewer when using the inverted method, I struggle to get it on even though the filter cap is cold. Knowing this, a cheap way to solve this problem is buying a replacement body, if you live somewhere where spare parts are cheap and available, such as the UK, rather than replacing the whole brewer.

b. Although the deformation is permanent, and gets severe enough that it gets more difficult to get the cap on and off even when the brewer is cold, it is always worse when it's warm. Knowing this, you can minimise this problem by not using the inverted method, and putting the filter cap on before you pour the hot water in. 

c. The original BPA-ful Aeropress didn't  have this issue, at least not to the same degree. I'm not gonna recommend that people go back to using their 15+ year old Aeropresses because of this, it's just an interesting observation. Different plastics are more or less prone to thermal deformation, so maybe it's possible for them to find a material that's both BPA-free and as durable as the original Aeropresses were.

Hoffmann recently griped about how ridiculous $150 for the Aeropress Premium is, and I have to say I agree, if that was what it cost originally I would have never gotten one. But I have to say, over the years I've spent almost that much on the 4 different Aeropresses I've had to buy, so, assuming you don't break the fragile glass body, maybe $150 isn't so ridiculous for a brewer that'll never have the same thermal deformation issues as the plastic ones.

Personally though, rather than a Go and a premium and a clear and an XL, I'd much rather Aeropress give us a brewer with a new material blend that is both BPA-free and also less prone to thermal deformation long term than the current plastic ones.",3,1747351159.0,AeroPress,2,1.0,False

I started getting better and better, then I took antibiotics and it's like my anxiety restarted, leaving me feeling like I'm back at square 1. You'd think that with my previous recovery, I'd know what to do and get myself back up. Haha lol nah, these panic symptoms are way different to my usual anxiety symptoms like nausea and stomach aches. I primarily get hot flashes and numbness/tingling, so having to relearn what works best to combat that is annoying as hell, even when I'm at home. My anxiety has turned from being ""everything is so unpredictable outside"" to ""I'm scared of having a panic attack."" I feel like an absolute burden, my partner emphasised that he wants me to eventually work so I get more financial freedom and also so that we can eventually live together... who knows when that'll happen now haha.

The guilt of being back at this horrible place is eating me alive. My mom keeps asking when we'll have a coffee date again, when we'll go clothes shopping, how it sucks that I can't help her locally find shoes for her holiday. My partner mentioned he was disappointed/frustrated when I couldn't meet him at the train station like I usually would, his family asked him what happened because I said I'd visit weekly before everything went to shit. I couldn't see my friend's final performance exam at the local campus theater. I haven't seen my friends in almost a year now (I haven't been able to see them when I was mostly recovered because of their uni and their personal life stuff). I take antidepressants and have propranolol to help with anxiety, but it doesn't really make a difference. I've restarted 6 week therapy (its the only free option for me atm). Seriously, I feel like I'm at my wit's end, hoping I just push myself up and get off my ass and get back to it. But it's like I just lost the motivation, I keep beating myself up. I know I shouldn't, but I just can't help but feel frustrated and annoyed that I'm back to this sucky place.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what’s called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

I’m putting 18grams in, trying to pull 36g. It seems to go a touch fast on my current setting —so  I went to grinder size 10 and it was definitely too slow — it seemed like 11 was my best bet. I pulled a couple good shots, but it keeps changing up on me and tasting sour…

Ugh. Should I just sell my machine and opt for something else? Can anyone share their experience with this machine, how they were able to dial in, any advice? Also advice on grind settings and which ones work for you?

Thank you. Any help is appreciated.

1knm6zo,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpghorrorstories/comments/1knm6zo/seeking_advice_fellow_player_unintentionally_went/,"Seeking Advice: Fellow player unintentionally went too far with a spooky joke, and I don’t know what to do","Minor spoiler warning: Some descriptions of EARLY curse of strahd story.

I’ve been playing with a group for about 5 years now, pandemic party, and we have played through several campaigns both homebrew and module. Everyone in the group is great, we’ve been friends since college (we are in our late 20’s to early 30’s). Our rotating DMs are fantastic, everyone gets really into the role playing, and we usually laugh till we cry or cry real tears at touching moments. 

We recently finished a homebrewed campaign and thought we’d go for a module next. I, a big horror fan, suggested we do the classic Curse of Strahd. Everyone was excited, the homebrewed campaign was really silly so something serious could be fun. 

We all made characters really on theme, I played a ghost buster artificer, we had a barbarian werewolf (Barb/Druid), a warlock vampire seeking revenge and a spiritualist rogue (Phantom Rogue, the star of our story I will call PR.). So here we were all geared up to really get into the horror game!

The first few sessions were great, we get into the House and start exploring. The Rogue does some extra sneaking around, enters the library and finds an Ouija board. Obviously PR LOVED finding that, we all did. Their character was inspired by the Long Island Medium (LIM), so sign us up for some seances with that accent. We ended the session shortly after and we all got excited about the things we were finding in the campaign. 

The next session, we get together on a Friday night. It was our once-a-month long sessions where we sit around the coffee table and play till we drop. Sometimes these nights go till 1 or 2 in the morning. In the story we get to the house basement, and are taking a short rest, during the short rest PR says they want to use their Oujia board to try and contact a spirit to help us. DM says yes of course, but then PR-the player- pulls out an actual Ouija board out of their bag. All still fun and games, but it did make me a little nervous. It’s a little bit passed midnight, I’m a little inebriated and I have had some *spooky* experiences before, I saw my grandfather and a couple other “ghosts” as a kid. Those experiences are part of why I like the genre so much and I know I shouldn’t believe in this stuff, and what I saw as a kid was probably just coincidences and shadows. But I was a little shaken.

I don’t protest because it’s all fun and games. PR is doing the LIM voice, and really doing a good impersonation, it’s funny. She says she’s got a spirit in the room with us and jokes that its someone who knows my character. Of course, I made the ghostbuster character, point the spirit at me, that’s still funny. But then at one point she asks us to close our eyes and put our hands on the pointer, or whatever that’s called, and she’s going to ask the spirit a question. We do, and she asks “Who is going to be the first to die?” We all laugh, it's an intense question but it's a horror campaign so that’s fine. 

Then the pointer “moves” and starts spelling a name out, ‘G’-‘A’-‘R’-‘R’-‘Y’, my real fucking name. Everyone breaks and starts laughing. I am not really as amused and say, out of character and a little annoyed, “What the hell, why did you spell my name?” She laughs in character and in the LIM voice comes up with some way to play it off. She then asks us to close our eyes again and she’s going to ask it a question. She tells us only she will put her hands on the pointer. 

Half annoyed, but not trying to be a jerk, I go silent but I don’t close my eyes. Her next question, “Spirit prove you are in the room with us.” In that moment, the pointer like flicks off the coffee table and hits me in the forehead! It didn’t hurt but I got even more mad, “What the hell? Why are you targeting me? I don’t like this.” 

This time she gets that I am no longer having the same amount of fun, and out of character she says, “I’m so sorry, I really didn’t intend for it to hit you. I closed my eyes and put my weight on the pointer, it must’ve slipped. I really am sorry.” I can tell her apology is genuine, she’s been a long time friend, and I’m slightly inebriated, it’s ok. She does a couple more bits with the ouija board, that are clearly more in line with the game, the DM is going back and forth and we all laugh. We play a few more hours and then head our separate ways. Nothing else really comes from the “situation” and instead it feels like we have all moved on. 

I tried to get over the incident but the past two weeks I find myself being very anxious over the experience. We play every other week and since then I keep waking up at 12:33am almost like clockwork. I feel like I see shadows move in the corner of my eye or I hear a neighbor’s door close and I’m just frozen in fear. I either don’t fall back asleep or some nights the exhaustion gets me and I can sleep but I never feel rested any more. 

I know she didn’t intend for this, nor did I think this is how I would react to the situation. I love horror movies, especially paranormal movies. I’m really not sure what to do. Do I say something to her and the group? Should I remove myself from the campaign and just take a break? 

Tl;dr: a friend made a joke that has affected me in a way I wasn’t expecting, how do I navigate this new feeling?

""Oh my god! Yaomomo has a boyfriend before me?!""

""FUCK! Whoever the bastard is he's lucky as fuck!""

""Aww, that's so sweet!""

""Congrats Yaomomo.""

""Ah, uhm thank you guys, but I prefer you don't ask any further questions."" Was all she said before exiting the common rooms. 

An awkward silence took over the room, until Hagakure spoke.

""Sooo...who do you guys think is the lucky guy?"" 

""I bet Jirou knows, do you?"" Mina said, turning her head towards the girl perched up on one of the couches. 

Her eyes avoided Mina's, the coffee table was interesting to look at apparently “Uh…I…I d—I don't know. “

""Oh she definitely knows."" Kaminari said.

Hagakure, eager to solve the mystery that was Yaomomo's boyfriend, exclaimed ""C'mon Jirou tell us!""

""I can't...I promised Momo not to say anything."" she mumbled.

""What was that? Can't hear you~""

""It's not my place to say that."" 

""Does he go to our school?"" Mina asked

Jirou's only response was her face turning a light shade of pink.

""Oh my god he does!"" 

""I never said anything about that!"" Jirou exclaimed.

""Now now Jirou, we all know out of all of us, you're one of the worst liars in class. Your face gave it away!"" 

""Right! Now tell us; is he in the hero course? No wait—is he in our class?"" Mina pressed on.

Jirou's blush deepened at the suggestion of the boyfriend being in 1A. 

""HE IS! HOLY FUCK! Who do you think is the boyfriend?! Guys?!"" 

""Maybe it's Bakugou. I mean, if she kept it a secret for this long, so could he! He's not too big on sharing his personal life."" Kirishima chimed in. 

""PFFFT! No way! Bakugou and Yaomomo are like oil and water–they don't mix."" Mina stated. 

“You're lucky he's sparring with Midoriya, or else he would make your fight into a real chemical reaction! Ha!” Sero chuckled at his own bad joke.

""Maybe it's me~""

""If it were you then we would've known from the first date."" Jirou deadpanned.

Kaminari pouted ""Aww man, you have no faith in me Jirou..""

Kirishima, interested in the guessing game, suggested “What if it's Midoriya?”

“Maybe but....no.”

""I know, mes amis~"" Aoyama's voice cut through the chatter ""C'est Iida, oui.""

""No wait because that makes sense! They're both bookish, class reps, and overly formal! I think its him!"" Mina declared. ""I saw them hugging after our work studies.""

""No way!""

Uraraka, who was silent for the majority of the conversations, said ""What if it's Todoroki?""

The suggestion was a light bulb moment for Hagakure ""Waiit! Now that you mention it, that does make sense OMG! Imagine guys: two star-crossed lovers from wealthy families. Both with deep emotional depths that are confusing to most, but understood by each other. I see the vision!""

However, Mina didn't seem all too impressed with the idea ""Uh no offense Ochacko, but I think that's the most easiest option to go with. Besides, you see the chemistry between her and Iida?! Top notch"" 

“Guys,” Asui said, “maybe this isn't a good idea? This seems like something Yaomomo-chan wants to keep private, so we shouldn't add fuel to the fire and speculate.” 

“Aww c'mon Tsu!” Hagakure whined. “It's fun, but wait…who do you think she's dating?”

The frog girl sighed “I wouldn't pretend that I wasn't curious about who it is, but I do want to respect her wishes and not egg on the topic.” 

“But who do you think it is though?“

“No one.”

“Come on Tsu pleaseee”

“No Toru, no.”

“Pretty please pretty pleaaseeeeeee! With the sprinkles on top!! “

Asui huffed, knowing that Hagakure wouldn't rest until she got an answer. “If it were to be someone in this class, it'd be someone that's least expected.”

“Maybe it's Shoji.”

“What.”

“Nothing. “

“Ooh ooh! I know! Maybe it's Sero!” Mina exclaimed.

Sero laughed “Thanks for the suggestion but that is not a possibility.”

“What if it's Satou?” Hagakure mentioned.

Mina brushed off that idea “Nah, I don't see it. No offense Satou.”

“None taken.” Satou said.

“What if it's Tokoyami?!” Uraraka piped up. 

“No.” The birdhead stated blankly.

“What about Ojiro?!”

“No, Koda!“

“I still think it's Todoroki!”

“It's Midoriya!”

At the rate they were going, it was going to take half the day assuming.

-----

Currently it was winter break, and all but three students were out visiting family and participating in activities the season has to offer. 

Jirou strolled to the fifth four, in the mood to annoy her friend. The winter break gave her the opportunity to recharge, but she was missing the company of her friend, and since there was nobody else, she headed towards her dorm. Humans are social creatures after all. 

She swung open the door without any care in the world, but stopped because of what she saw.

There Momo was, she was pretty much cuddling with Satou, their bodies covered with a humongous blanket. A laptop was in front of them the only source of light in the room. Judging by Momo's expression, they were watching something scary.

They looked up from the laptop to where Jirou stood in the doorway, surprised by her unexpected visit.

“Eww, get a room.” 

“But we are in a room…”

Hi, I started a week ago am at world 5 currently. I have all the heroes in the picture and the weapon for 1^(st) commander, euhna, kamael, AA72 ( obviously ), and Claude.

I still have one of the box allowing to chose between the weapons of euhna, the scythe mature girl, kamael, oghma or kai



I’m pretty sure I can already do some teams or am 1 off from being able to. I would like to be able to make teams to perform in higher difficulty contents  


Currently, I :

\- have beaten all ressources dungeons to lvl 100 except red shard which I’d like to beat to finish AA72 quest but I seem a bit far off from it



\- have beaten evolution dungeon for water and dark to level 100



\- am chilling at world 5 taking my time through the story



\- have no idea what I should focus on and what to spend my coffee onto



My current main Hero was 1^(st) commander until yesterday since I got euhna which I put in training and AA72 is much stronger in virtue of having an event

I also wonder what’s the order of importance of different ressources for the event with multiple paths and what the exclusive engineer upgrade does ( I’m traducing the name from french so I’m not sure it’s correct )



So any tips are welcome, it’s a tad overwhelming after world 4. I would also be interested in good youtubers to watchs for comps showcase or early game progression

[The new enhanced folder view in Razuna](https://preview.redd.it/53d21vb2111f1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67a5669d4130b9f946080f97831df88a6408ddda)

Hey there, Razuna community! We're thrilled to announce a series of fantastic updates designed to improve your workflow and make your experience even more enjoyable. Let's dive into the details of each feature to ensure you get the most out of these enhancements.

Find the video for these updates at [https://youtu.be/5b4QcyC7sxE?si=Fr00q-\_4EA4wXMuW](https://youtu.be/5b4QcyC7sxE?si=Fr00q-_4EA4wXMuW) or continue reading below.

# 1. Collapsible Sidebar for a Cleaner Workspace

One of our major updates is the introduction of a brand-new collapsible sidebar. This user-centric design, understanding that you value a workspace that is functional and free from distractions, allows you to expand or minimize the sidebar as needed. This gives you more screen space to focus solely on your content, creating a cleaner and more organized environment. Say goodbye to clutter and hello to a more immersive creative process!

# 2. Redesigned Shared Folder View

Navigating your files just got a whole lot easier! We've completely revamped the shared folder view to include a familiar folder tree layout. This intuitive design makes locating your documents simpler than ever. You can quickly browse your folders and find precisely what you need without the hassle. And with the new 'Download All' button, you can gather multiple files in one go, putting the power in your hands and making your workflow even more efficient.

# 3. Streamlined Downloads with Integrated Options

To further enhance user experience, we're excited to introduce the ""Download All"" feature directly within Razuna itself. No more tedious switching between apps or navigating multiple windows. With everything just a click away, you can access your files quickly and efficiently. This feature is handy when you need to download multiple files at once, saving you valuable time that could be better spent on your creative tasks.

# 4. Improved File Previews for Easy Access

We know how important it is for you to preview your files swiftly. That's why we've made significant improvements to our file preview system. For nearly any file type, you'll now see thumbnails that allow you to quickly identify the content without opening it. And for those formats like Word documents that typically aren't star players in web previews, we've stepped up our game by automatically generating PDF previews. Check out a document instantly rather than going through the hassle of downloading it first, streamlining your workflow and freeing up your time.

# 5. Native Support for RAW Files

Photography enthusiasts, rejoice! We are thrilled to announce that Razuna, together with the existing support for HEIC and HEIF files, now has native support for all RAW file formats. You can easily import high-quality camera photos into Razuna and share them seamlessly. But that's not all—we've also included an online image editor that allows you to make adjustments directly within our platform. Whether you want to crop, adjust colors, or add filters, you have the tools at your fingertips.

# 6. Enhanced User Management System

Managing your team just became much simpler with our enhanced user management system. We now offer bulk user import options and the ability to add users individually. This update is designed to make the onboarding process for your team quicker and more efficient, allowing everyone to get started immediately. No more long waiting periods; everyone can dive into their work and begin collaborating sooner.

# In Conclusion

These updates represent our commitment to continually improving your experience with Razuna. We hope you love these features as much as we enjoyed building them. Your feedback and involvement play a crucial role in shaping our platform, and we can't wait to share even more exciting features in the future. Thank you for being a part of the Razuna community, and we look forward to hearing your thoughts on these new features. Stay tuned for all the great things coming your way!",1,1747349940.0,razuna,0,1.0,False
