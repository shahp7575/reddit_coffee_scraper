I‚Äôve been a barista and a coffee lover for years, so when I got the chance to design a poster for a latte art competition, I put a ton of passion into it. Unfortunately, the caf√© that commissioned it ended up not using it (long story), even though I was offering it at a really affordable price. They went with a different (ugly imo) design made by a friend of one of their employees instead.

I still really love how the poster turned out, and I‚Äôd hate for it to go to waste. It‚Äôs fully designed and ready to go and I can easily update the event details. If anyone here is organizing a latte art competition (or knows someone who is) and might be interested in buying it, let me know!

Also I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place to post this, apologies if it isn‚Äôt! If anyone can suggest where I might find someone interested, I‚Äôd really appreciate it.

I knew i needed to upgrade my grinder someday but when i heard about how good and how inexpensive the DF54 was, i knew i had to get it.

I ran through 400g of old dark roast coffee to season it, and did a Decaf Pour over with the v60 to celebrate, there was a huge difference in the clarity and brightness.

How much metadata makes for a comfortable start to a new game for you? Off the top of my head I'd like to be able to:

- Have access to fidget spinners, IPS, ILS, Mk.3 belts and basic pile sorters
- Warp relatively soon and (ideally) recharge using deuteron fuel rods
- Build advanced miners soon after starting (I HATE placing fiddly lobster miners, it's the worst part of the game for me)
- Be able to place down decent sized blueprints (5x10 building blocks or larger) and have them build fast enough that I don't have to go for a coffee break

Is this unrealistic? I know the full tech tree costs around 60k of each of the lower types and that it's one-off, seed specific, etc. What do you find is a comfortable pot of metadata to spend on a new save?

I know there is a commenter who yells people in this Reddit saying that ABI is not TBI, but, when you have a brain injury, this is the forum. There‚Äôs no where to go for hypoxia. So please let this be my community too. 

I spent two days in a coma from Dec 5-17 during which time I had a kind of hypoxia. Since waking up in the ICU, physically I am fine. MRI is clean. CT clean. It‚Äôs just that cognitively I am sooooo bad. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve not really woken up, everything is a blur even three months later.

I look at a sunset and I don‚Äôt process it. I used to love them. Now I can‚Äôt even see them. My wife slips and falls. I have zero reaction. I‚Äôm pretty sure someone could be executed in front of me, and my heartbeat wouldn‚Äôt rise. By the way, this is not PTSD or shock or something psychological. I can tell you that with certainty. It‚Äôs 100% neurological. 

I drink coffee, I don‚Äôt feel it. I scan over text with my eyes, I don‚Äôt really understand it unless I stop to pay attention. I go to get something from a drawer. It‚Äôs in my hand and I can‚Äôt remember why I got it 2 minutes later. 

Will I ever wake up from this? Will I ever come present again? I‚Äôm 44 f-ing years old. I can‚Äôt go through life like this. 

I‚Äôm so freaking scared cause the rule of thumb with brain injuries is supposedly that the most improvement change happens in the first three months, and then slows down after that.  And I haven‚Äôt felt any improvement or change in the three months in any of this cognitive symptoms. 

Does that mean this is the rest of my life?

Did anyone see major improvements in terms of coming back into the present moment cognitively speaking AFTER three months from the injury?

I run and lift weights every day and have gotten into the best shape of my life over the past three months since waking up. I do hyberbaric oxygen chamber every day which takes a total of five hours of my time since it‚Äôs 90 minutes from where I live and the dives take 120 minutes.

1j30n4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1j30n4s/dear_you/,Dear you,"You invited me into a house you weren't ready to share.

You told me to pack my bags and make this house my home. I didn't want to impose, but you assured me it was alright. ""My pumpkin, I want you to stay here with me, more than anything in the world"".

It was a lovely house - better than anything I've ever imagined. You had three cats, a cozy fireplace in the corner, and shelves lined with books, the same ones as mine back home. A moka pot on the stove, a loaf of sourdough bread in the oven, a bunch of freshly cut daffodils in a vase.

You even showed me the secret room, the one you never let anyone else enter. It was filled with your poetry, childhood mementos, and a collection of plush toys I never expected you to have. 

Everything is perfect when we‚Äôre together. I wake up next to you, next to your handsome, angelic face. You make us coffee, and I admire you as you work so passionately. We make fresh pasta for dinner, and we snuggle under the blanket to watch our favorite shows. You read me fairy tales until I fall asleep. You kiss my forehead gently, and you call me your princess.

Your house almost felt like home. I would have loved to stay forever, except for one odd thing.

There were statues with scary faces placed randomly around your house. I told you how they made me uncomfortable, but you refused to move them. Every time I brought them up, you glared at me with a stern face and said: ""Why do you hate these statues so much? What did they do wrong to you? Do the faces on them scare you? Are you a coward? Maybe you need to talk to your therapist about why you have this irrational fear"".

You told me to deal with it, so I stared into the faces of these statues, hoping to numb myself and stop being scared. I wanted so badly to be here. I stared until their images burned into my eyes and haunted my nightmares. They made me feel so unsafe, but you didn't care. 'Don't touch anything and don't move anything. This is my house, not yours'.

These statues must mean something significant to you, seeing how you insist on keeping them despite how much they hurt me. I tried to understand, but your explanation only made it more painful. You don't even like them, you kept them to prove a point. Removing them for me would make you less of a man, because what kind of man lets his girlfriend tell him what to do? What would I do next, rearrange your furnitures, repaint your walls, give you a curfew?

My love, don't you see that I'm here because your house already feels like home, just the way it is? I never wanted to change anything. I wish you could see that I never intended to take control, all I ever wanted was to feel safe. I tried, I really did, to respect your wishes and live with these damn statues. But I can't anymore.

I packed my bags and moved back into my shack. Some days, I still imagine that the bed I'm lying in is yours, and I would wake up next to you, the sun kissing your face. I cry myself to sleep missing you, but at least now I feel safe. At least in this house, everyone cares enough to make me feel loved and protected, even if 'everyone' is just me.

You're back in your empty home, wondering what's so awful about it that I couldn't stay.",2,1741056125.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

So this might be a long one but I am on a journey to lose 20lbs. I have a small frame and the 20 on is not great. Of course I tried everything and finally realized this will only come off with consistency, movement, good eating and weight training. With that said, I want to know who actually saw progress, how long did it take and what moved the needle for you? This is hard and I‚Äôm 5 weeks in with little to show for it.

Was there something that really shifted the weight down for you? What was it? 

To share in case something in here should be changed or edited I‚Äôd like to post a list of things I‚Äôve done so far that are different from my previous habits:

1. Stopped drinking coffee on an empty stomach

2. Eat breakfast within an hour of waking (most days) and make sure it‚Äôs 30 grams of protein

3. Tracking my food and Eating with my cycle. I write down almost everything and weigh it and I focus on protein and also incorporate as many foods as I can that are good to eat based on where I‚Äôm at in my cycle

4. 10,000 steps a day. No excuses. Everyday at 3.5 mph on a walking pad or outside. 

5. Weight training or resistance. Moderate weight, different groups of muscles 5x a week. On weekends I still walk, do yoga or do some light stretching 

6. Try and get 7 hours of sleep (doesn‚Äôt always work but I do try)

7. Supplements. I‚Äôm taking thyroid supplement, green debloat drink, protein shakes after work outs, chromium, zinc, magnesium, biotin for nails and hair, and a probiotic. 

8. Don‚Äôt eat after 7:30pm. Granted there have been like 5 days that hasn‚Äôt worked but yes mostly I don‚Äôt eat late. 

I feel like I am doing all the things I should be but after 5 weeks I‚Äôm not feeling much different. Take a look and let me know what you think? Also what did you do that changed things for you and mostly, I just want to know if I should just keep going but I feel like I need to see results soon to stay this motivated.

1j30l39,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j30l39/i_19_m_have_an_unreachable_crush_18_f/,I (19 M) have an unreachable crush (18 F).,"Wow where to start. I may sound like a creep. It all started one year ago, where I was just doing lessons after school (I don't know if that's a common thing abroad but when you are trying to get to a college here it's a pretty common practice). 

We were in 2 classes together and you could say I immediately had a crush on her. However I never made any move due to:
1)My lack of confidence 
2) The pressure of studying for college 
3) If I got rejected we would still be in the same class which would have been awkward 

I told my friends I have a crush on her and they all told me the classic ""Try to approach her because otherwise you'll regret it""

Me and my entire class which was like 5 people started hanging out after the lessons sometimes.
One time she told us she really isn't looking for any relationship at the time. (I didn't bring that up, it just came up as a topic and it wasn't like I made any move other than being friendly). I don't know if it was a sign for me or anyone else but I took it as I should and I immediately halted any plans of asking her out (not that I had really tried). I made sure to never overstep my boundaries.

Afraid of the rejection I knew was 100% guaranteed, I didn't really try anything other than treating her like a normal friend. I slowly ""moved"" on. Then we had the exams and the friend group kind of split up since we didn't have any classes together anymore except in rare scenarios that occur once every three months pretty much (those still occur I guess.) I should probably add that we didn't talk that much online either.

Where does that take us?  Present day. We haven't really talked that much the past 6 months and I was sure I had moved on from what I imagined was just a random, simple crush. Two days ago I went to a neighbouring city with my friends to have some fun . While at the club I didn't really feel like trying my luck with any girls even though I found some of them attractive looking. After the club, me and my friends just went to a coffee shop where we spend our night. The following day as we walked through the city, looking for a place to sit I suddenly saw her. We talked for 5 minutes (friendly as ever) and then just continued our day. I tried not to think much about it and continued my day with my friends. 

After a while though I realized I am such an idiot. I haven't moved on from her.  I regret my actions so, so much. I was friendly to her but I never showed her any kind of sign that I care about her. My friends told me I would regret it but I never imagined I would feel like this. I don't know what to do. I haven't talked to my friend about this because they told me I would regret it and they were right. 

I am split so much. I don't know if I did the right thing or if just questioning my decision makes me overstep set boundaries? I don't know if I should try a move now (since we aren't really studying in order to get into college) or if it's too late, we live in completely different cities after all (3 hours with the bus)?  Even if I want to approach her how do I even begin after such a long time of not really speaking that much? ",1,1741055944.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j30eog,https://www.reddit.com/r/sterilization/comments/1j30eog/complete_guide_for_bisalp_insurance_prep_and/,"Complete Guide for Bisalp: Insurance, Prep, and Recovery","Hi guys! I just had my procedure about a month ago and had a really smooth recovery and minimal insurance issues so I wanted to share my experience in case anyone finds it helpful. I hope everyone‚Äôs able to get the care they need and I‚Äôm so happy for everyone on this journey! Sorry this is long, I wanted to be thorough and include everything I‚Äôve learned.


Insurance

If you live in the US and your insurance is ACA compliant, your procedure and ALL associated costs are covered 100% by your insurance plan and you will not be responsible for any cost-sharing, like deductible or coinsurance. DO NOT GIVE THEM A DIME. It‚Äôs likely that you will receive an ‚Äúestimate‚Äù letter, a phone call, or you may be told a total that you will owe once you check in at the office. You may even get all 3. THIS ESTIMATE IS WRONG. This is an arbitrary number that the hospital comes up with when they run your procedure through an insurance algorithm. This calculation does not take into account that the ACA covers voluntary sterilization fully with no typical cost-sharing. If they ask for payment, tell the office ‚Äúin accordance with the ACA, my insurance will cover the procedure and all associated costs in full. Please bill them first and if there is anything left (there should not be), you can bill me later‚Äù. It‚Äôs sneaky and shitty but these hospitals and insurance companies want to squeeze you for cash at any chance they get and hope you don‚Äôt know any better. Even many of the office employees don‚Äôt know these rules about the ACA, but stay firm and do not pay. I was told that I needed to pay $2300 up front, but I told them my insurance would cover it and the employee at check in said no problem, waived the upfront request, and let me know that they‚Äôd bill insurance first. Unfortunately, Aetna is like all insurance companies and sucks, so they are trying to bill me for the recovery room. More unfortunately for them, the ACA is extremely clear in ‚ÄúFAQs about Affordable Care Act Implementation Part 54‚Äù released on July 28, 2022 that ALL ‚Äúitems and services integral to the procedure‚Äù are paid for 100% by insurance. This includes anesthesia, recovery room, pain meds, and any tools or supplies used during prep, surgery, and recovery. I‚Äôve filed my appeal and they‚Äôll have the $800 charge reversed or I‚Äôm going to become such a pain in the ass to that company that they will consider shutting down operations. Source: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/faqs-part-54.pdf

The magic codes for this are diagnostic code Z30.2 which designates the procedure as preventive (100% covered), and procedure code 58661 which is the specific code for a bilateral salpingectomy. **IF your insurance tries to tell you they only cover a tubal litigation under these preventive rules, they are practicing what is called ‚Äúreasonable medical management‚Äù. HOWEVER, if your doctor recommends a specific procedure like a bisalp, they MUST cover it at 100%. They are required to offer exceptions to reasonable medical management.

Prep

I had my surgery at 10:30 am on a Wednesday, so that meant no food after midnight and only clear liquids up until 8:30 am. I checked in at 8:30 am and was released around 1:30 pm. For my recovery, I took Wednesday-Friday off sick from work and requested to work from home for the following week. I know that‚Äôs a luxury many people don‚Äôt have, but don‚Äôt worry! I could‚Äôve easily gone back to work within a couple of days, I was just being a baby.

They had me shower the night before and morning of with Hibiclens antiseptic soap, and I had to stop taking my Turmeric supplement a week prior to surgery. I stopped taking Advil and smoking weed 3 days before.

I ordered way too much stuff to prepare, but a lot of it really came in handy! I got a couple of large sleep shirts from Soma, some comfy boxers from Woxer and MeUndies (feelfree boxers), and compression socks to help with circulation while I was more sedentary. I got a picnic basket to hold some snacks, drinks, meds and books all close by without having to move around too much. A medium sized one will work fine! I also got the star abdominal pillow from Amazon since it fits against you really well and can loop through a seat belt and hold an ice pack. A weighted heating pad also worked wonders! Just try to keep the heat off your incisions.

For meds, I stocked up on Miralax, Liquid IV, Calmour gas strips, Gas-X, Advil, and Digestive Enzymes (from TikTok shop). For food, I got some snacks like goldfish and apple sauce pouches and Pop-Tarts, but I also got a TON of blackberries and raspberries (great sources of fiber and easy to eat). I also got oatmeal and soup (broccoli cheddar of course) and a loaf of French bread.

Setting up my house, I took everything I knew I‚Äôd need out of higher cabinets and lower shelves and put them on my counters and tables so I wouldn‚Äôt have to bend over or reach too much. I did this with food, meds, skincare products, and clothes to keep everything easily accessible. I added a stack of books to my coffee table to have them in easy reach. It looked like a disaster but it worked!

To the hospital I wore a loose T-shirt and my softest and least effective sports bra, boxers, loose sweatpants, a zip up jacket (February ugh), and slip on shoes. 10/10 recommend.


Recovery

Disclaimer before I go into this: I have a really high pain tolerance (untreated endometriosis from age 10 to age 20 will do that for you) and a really talented doctor, so YMMV but my recovery was a breeze! The worst part was probably how bloated and gassy I was afterwards, and I had an IUD inserted (for endometriosis control) so I had some cramping from that.

My friend picked me up from the hospital and they made me wheelchair out to the car, but I could walk without much difficulty pretty much right away. I was able to get dressed by myself with the nurse nearby and was very glad that I‚Äôd brought slip-on shoes. We drove to Panera and picked up some soup and sandwiches, then picked up my meds from the pharmacy and went home. She hung out to keep an eye on me for a few hours, but I felt fine other than being tired. She actually had to tell me to sit down several times, which is also helpful to remember to rest even when you‚Äôre feeling good.

Other than cramping and feeling tired, I had very little pain to deal with so I was super lucky. I had some slight pain from the belly button incision for a couple of days, but I was able to balance an ice pack right over my belly button with the star pillow and use the weighted heating pad on my lower abdomen. I only took 2 of the oxycodone tablets I was prescribed and mostly relied on Advil and Tylenol on rotation. I felt almost back to normal other than some stomach issues by late Thursday/early Friday.

Speaking of stomach issues- I started every morning with a full 33-oz bottle of water mixed with Liquid IV and Miralax. Trust me. I followed that with oatmeal and berries for breakfast and was feeling regular again by day 2.

Most of all- take care of yourself! Now is the time to enjoy a little downtime. Read, watch movies or TikTok, call some friends, take a nap. Go on a quick walk, at least 10 minutes at a time, at least 2-3 times a day. Go as slow as you need to, but you‚Äôll feel much better as you do. When getting up, try to roll to your side instead of sitting up with your abs. Try to stretch gently whenever you get up, just don‚Äôt strain yourself. You got this! You just took charge of your body and your future and that‚Äôs awesome. Thank you to everyone I got advice from before my surgery and I hope everyone has a safe procedure and easy recovery!",1,1741055392.0,sterilization,1,1.0,False

Nobody likes paying 600 Rs. for 100g and then wasting most of it in dialing in the brew. I beg you to provide reference recipes with the beans so that your customers have a decent starting point. I have had this experience multiple times with different specialty roasters in India and all I hear is ""oh maybe you are doing it wrong"". I have the best gear one can buy, use curated water when necessary. I have traveled around the world sampling specialty coffee from different countries and I have mostly experienced this phenomenon in India. So no, I don't think I am doing it wrong when I can get excellent brews out of every other bean than yours. Stop the gaslighting and provide reference recipes so we can compare. If you can't do that then learn to take proper feedback from your customers.

To members of this community and customers who enjoy specialty beans. Please hold your roasters to higher standards so they provide a better value for money. It's actually not that hard to get a good brew out of well roasted beans. Roasting is an art that needs people with a good pallette first and foremost. It's not simply getting an expensive machine and pushing a button with preset roast profile, which is what a lot of Indian roasters feel like to me. So if your roaster tells you to get an expensive grinder or a better brewer before getting the best out of their beans, then you are being duped. I am not saying grinders and proper brewing technique is not important. It can take a good brew to a great one. But if you cannot even get a good brew, then its likely the beans or the roast.

1j30cqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaltech/comments/1j30cqy/my_experience_breaking_into_legal_tech/,My Experience Breaking Into (Legal) Tech,"Wanted to share my advice on breaking into legal tech, as I found this subreddit very helpful during my job search. tl;dr: graduated from law school a couple of years ago, did litigation for a bit, did a clerkship, then took a few months off to do a job search because I was interested in pivoting to tech. I do not have a technical background, although I was an RA for a law school professor who teaches tech law/policy. Caveat that, although I primarily applied for roles at legal tech companies and received a few offers, I actually ended up accepting an operations role at an AI startup that does not intersect with law (happy to share the company name if you DM me since they're still hiring but not trying to make this post about them!).

My advice:    
\- I did around 75-80 calls during my job search, most of which I found immensely helpful to (1) get a better sense of the legal tech, and particularly the legal AI, landscape and (2) find job leads. On every call, I'd ask the person I was speaking with who they recommended talking to next, which was a great way to get outside my own network bubble. I also did a decent amount of cold emailing/LinkedIn messaging (and even some cold Reddit messaging), which had a surprisingly high response rate.

\- If you graduated from law school relatively recently, I highly recommend scheduling coffee chats with a few professors to ask for their advice. Even though many of my professors didn't have a background in legal tech, they knew which of their former students did and were willing to connect me with them. Your school may also have a specific legal tech institution that's worth reaching out to (e.g., Berkman Klein Center at HLS, CodeX at Stanford, etc.).

\- Start following tech / legal tech folks on Twitter and LinkedIn and learning about whatever tech space you want to break into (e.g., if you're interested in AI, I'd recommend Andrej Karpathy's 'Intro to Large Language Models' on YouTube and the famous 2023 'Attention Is All You Need' paper if you haven't read it yet).

\- Make your resume less law and more business. Obviously, you've practiced law so that's going to be on your resume. But just changing the wording around how you describe the work that you've done can be helpful. I went through my resume and both (1) tried to make legal concepts more understandable for non-lawyers and (2) put in more business-type descriptors of my legal work such as 'project management' and 'client engagement.'

\- Do you research. I only had a vague idea of what a product manager or customer success operator did before starting my search, so had a lot of catching up to do. I also found it useful to learn more about the different fundraising startups and the risk/reward associated with each stage.

\- Be humble. If you're coming from Big Law, you're likely going to take a pay cut and it also may feel like there's a loss of prestige, at least to start. In order to join an incredible company, I ended up taking a role that many recent college grads are in and have zero regrets about it - but it was hard to get over the initial hurdle of feeling like I had to go backward in order go forward and it also made me realize that more of my identity/ego was tied up in being a lawyer than I had realized.

\- What you lose in salary, you may makeup for in equity, particularly if you're applying to startups. This should go without saying for lawyers but you should ensure you know how to effectively negotiate both the equity amount and the terms around the equity (for example, the time window you have to exercise vested equity after leaving the company). I also found it helpful to run my offers and the companies I was considering joining past some VC friends.

Hope at least some folks find these tips are useful - and sending good vibes to everyone undertaking a job search right now!!",3,1741055221.0,legaltech,0,0.8,False

Anything in brackets is potentially identifiable information that I edited out. 

Thank you.

[Wife],

I want to preface this with the following: 

I love you. 

None of this is your fault. 

I always have, always do, and I always will want to be with you forever. 

I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. 

This is going to be very hard for me, but I feel like I need to say it out loud myself so please let me read this first in its entirety and then we can talk. 

For the past month I have been struggling immensely with my gender identity and after dissecting my thoughts and feelings over that time I am very confident that I am Transgender and want to transition into being the woman that I truly am. 

The last 31 days have been very hard for me as I very suddenly had this realization and have spent the month going over all of my thoughts and feelings to come to this conclusion. I have cried every single day. I have been constantly filled with anxiety, loneliness, shame, fear and 100 other emotions that have been eating me alive inside. I have been unable to sleep and unable to eat for days on end over the amount of guilt that this is bringing me. While this was a relatively quick acceptance for me, I realize I have been repressing these feelings inside my whole life as I have been extremely ashamed and full of self hatred over these feelings. 

A month ago I was fully prepared to take the following to my grave and it is my biggest secret and my largest source of shame and issues: Since I was young, ever since I can remember having sexual thoughts, I have always been turned on over the thought of magically swapping bodies with or turning into a girl. It started with just reading erotic stories online and has continued to be one of the few things that I masturbate too. I have carried so much shame and hate over this fetish, but it has been there continuously for over 20 years. I cordoned off this section of myself out of shame and embarrassment and relegated it to just pure sexual fantasy and never allowed myself to think about it in any other way. I have since found that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a kink‚Äù is a common thought for many Transgender individuals before they find self acceptance.

My next biggest secret is that I cheated on my Chemistry 101 exams in College. 

Back when I first discovered these stories there was very little positive reinforcement of the transgender community in the media, it was mostly relegated to folks getting made fun of on Jerry Springer and the like. One of the prevailing thought processes in the public eye was that the only reason a man would want to be a woman would be so that they can have sex with other men with less shame. This is VERY WRONG and was damaging to me in more ways than I can imagine. 

I am and always have been attracted solely to women. Your beauty takes my breath away every day.  But when I read this incorrect thought process over 20 years ago I internalized it and suppressed any trans thoughts I had for the rest of my life. I like women so I can‚Äôt be trans right? Even consciously knowing that this was wrong ( [Friends of a friend who transitioned MtF and stayed married to her wife] or the store manager of [store and name of individual I worked closely with] who is transgender and married to her Cis wife for example) I still subconsciously held these beliefs and deeply buried any thoughts I ever had under immense layers of shame and probably some internalized transphobia that I am still working my way through.

So what led to my realization after burying all of my trans thoughts for this long? 

On Tuesday February 11th I had a soccer game that was supposed to start at 10pm. I had drank a ton of coffee that day so when you took some Nyquil and went to bed I was still wired, so I decided to take an edible and watch a movie. For clarity, I was not nearly as high as when I had [other breakdown about a job I hated also after taking an edible], but I do believe it helped break down enough of the shame wall that I have built around and used to suppress these thoughts and feelings and let me truly think on them for the first time in my life. I have not had anything since and have purposefully avoided all but 1 beer after a soccer game to make sure I‚Äôm as mentally clear as possible while thinking about myself, my identity, and the thought of completely blowing my life up.  

The movie was Your Name and it involves body swapping. I thought it would be a silly romcom thing to fall asleep to but I was very wrong. It was a beautiful and emotion driven film that lived up to its high praise it receives online which is the reason I decided to watch it. I teared up a lot watching the movie, but after it ended I started thinking about myself a little bit more and immediately began unraveling. So many thoughts that I've pushed down in the past of who I want to be. Who I wish I was. All my screens were off, yet I couldn't stop thinking about myself and my own gender identity. I stayed up in the dark for the next 4 hours, a whirlwind of thoughts, emotions, and tears; going over so many facets of myself that I never allowed myself to think about before. 

I wish the thoughts went away but they didn‚Äôt. The next day I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it and I spent over 6 hours the following night reading various reddit threads and stories from different transgender communities online. 

I have never felt so seen in my life. 

I've never allowed myself to think about my gender identity before and it was the most emotional 6 hours of my life as I slowly came to the conclusion that I'm pretty sure I'm trans. The amount of comments and stories I read from other people that were able to perfectly describe how I've been feeling these past 2 decades was traumatic. I don't think I stopped crying the whole time. 

My thoughts are not just a fetish. I have always been envious of women and wished I could express myself more femininely but have always suppressed my thoughts away because of the shame I felt feeling them or because I feared whatever backlash acting on these thoughts would bring. I have often wished I was someone else or was born a girl.

I have cried every single day since. The pain I‚Äôve been keeping inside is worse than when [childhood dog] died 4 years ago. My stomach has been in literal pain at times with how much anxiety and depression I have been working through. These feelings have not gone away and have in fact amplified as I read more and become more sure of myself. This last month has been the scariest of my life, but I have learned more about myself than ever before.

There a couple statements I feel the need to say out loud before I wrap this written portion out:

I want you to know that these feelings are real and not some sexual deviant‚Äôs desire.

I want to transition to being a woman.

I don‚Äôt want to socially transition until I feel passable, which will take 1-2+ years.

I currently have no desire to get rid of my penis.

I want breasts.

I want soft skin.

I want long hair I can try different styles with.

I don‚Äôt want hair on my face and ass.

I want to wear fun female outfits and dresses AND fill them out properly.

I want to feel comfortable with myself.

I don‚Äôt want to feel scared and self loathing.

I don‚Äôt want to hate looking in mirrors.

I want to wear silly dangly earrings and have fun nails.

I want to feel cute and pretty.

I want you to still love me.

I‚Äôm sure you have so many questions. I have been writing in a journal the past month that goes over all of this and a lot more in much greater detail that I would like for you to read at some point. I have also printed off a book that was extremely helpful to me; I have highlighted and commented on many things that resonated with me, helped explain something, or just generally made me feel better. 

I understand if you need time to digest. I understand if you hate me for lying to you, I am so sorry about all of this but I have unknowingly been lying to myself all this time too. If you want to talk, if you want to lock yourself in the library and read my journal, if you want to go upstairs and cry alone I understand but before you do I want to reiterate:

I love you more than anything else in the world.

None of this is your fault.

Back home, my parents would fill our house with countless possessions. Perhaps it was because we had plenty of space, or maybe it was their generation's desire for material abundance. Now, living away from home, I rent a 35-square-meter apartment in the city center. While the space is small and expensive, it unexpectedly led me to discover a different way of living.

The spatial constraints forced me to learn organization, and more importantly, to control the influx of items from the source. In my kitchen, for example, I only have an air fryer and a cooking pot, which sufficiently meet my daily cooking needs.

The biggest change has been in my wardrobe. I used to think I needed lots of clothes for different combinations, but now I wonder: why do humans need so many clothes? It's not just about space - it's wasteful and environmentally harmful.

So I started buying quality basic pieces. I only get one of each style, but I invest more in pants and outerwear because quality matters for frequently worn items. Gradually, I fell in love with mix-and-match styling: today it's pants A with top A and jacket B, tomorrow it becomes pants A with top B. Friends think I have lots of clothes, but it's really just different combinations of a few pieces.

This minimalism, which started out of necessity, has given me a clearer understanding of ""wants"" versus ""needs."" It's like looking at a coffee shop's elaborate menu - when you know you just love iced Americano, all those fancy options become unnecessary.

Minimalism has taught me that less is more. It's not just environmentally friendly; it brings clarity to life. When we truly understand what we need, we can live a richer life with less.",4,1741054825.0,minimalism,0,1.0,False

Baratza Encore grinder  
variable temp gooseneck kettle  
Origami dripper  
Kalita KWF-185 flat bottom filters

I have used 2 types of beans (both light roast):  
Onyx Geometry  
Confident Coffee Company Ethiopia

What I Saw online was that the Encore settings for pour over is generally around 18.

lets start with what I did with the Geometry coffee.  Onyx recommends a Encore setting of 29 (wayyyy too coarse IMO) for the grind size.    
  
18g of coffee, 290g of water, water ranging from 195-205.  Grind setting 29. Did not taste good at all.  It was too sour.  Went down to 18...bitter, tried 20...bitter, tried 22...bitter.  I don't think I went further than that, as no matter what I was doing it didn't seem to help.  I got third wave water packets and tried distilled water.  Same results.  I tried filtered water from my fridge, same thing.  Mostly I was doing the same recipe 50g bloom for 30 seconds, center pour up to around 130 or so, then another up to 200g something (spiral pour), then finishing up to the total of 290g.  One time I even looked up a recipe that said 12g of coffee, 100g bloom for 1 minute, then 1 final pour up to 200g of water.  Still tasted bitter.  

Thought maybe it was the beans, so I went and grabbed some of the Ethiopia from Confident Coffee Company.  

Made 2 cups of coffee today.  18g beans, 290g of water.  First time was with the encore setting of 18, then next one was 20.  Pretty much the first recipe I mentioned above (50g bloom for 30 seconds, center pour up to around 130 or so, then another up to 200g something (spiral pour), then finishing up to the total of 290g).  Both taste bitter.   Used filtered water from my fridge for both of these.

Now the 1st time with the Ethiopia, I used the Origami dripper.  The 2nd time, I thought what the hell, and brought out my 3-cup chemex, and tried that.  

What in the world am I doing wrong?! I am literally at wits end and it is making me not want to make any coffee at home.

I also have a bodum bistro grinder that I used to use and can easily break that one out again if need be.  ",2,1741054655.0,pourover,6,1.0,False

Just once wouldn't you love for someone to simply show you the evidence for God's existence? No arm-twisting. No statements of, ""You just have to believe."" Well, here is an attempt to candidly offer some of the reasons why God must exist.
 
1. The complexity of our planet points to a deliberate Designer who not only created our universe, but sustains it today.
Many examples showing God's design could be given, possibly with no end. But here are a few:

The Earth...its size is perfect. The Earth's size and corresponding gravity holds a thin layer of mostly nitrogen and oxygen gases, only extending about 50 miles above the Earth's surface. If Earth were smaller, an atmosphere would be impossible, like the planet Mercury. If Earth were larger, its atmosphere would contain free hydrogen, like Jupiter.3 Earth is the only known planet equipped with an atmosphere of the right mixture of gases to sustain plant, animal and human life.

The Earth is located the right distance from the sun. Consider the temperature swings we encounter, roughly -30 degrees to +120 degrees. If the Earth were any further away from the sun, we would all freeze. Any closer and we would burn up. Even a fractional variance in the Earth's position to the sun would make life on Earth impossible. The Earth remains this perfect distance from the sun while it rotates around the sun at a speed of nearly 67,000 mph. It is also rotating on its axis, allowing the entire surface of the Earth to be properly warmed and cooled every day.

And our moon is the perfect size and distance from the Earth for its gravitational pull. The moon creates important ocean tides and movement so ocean waters do not stagnate, and yet our massive oceans are restrained from spilling over across the continents.4

Water...colorless, odorless and without taste, and yet no living thing can survive without it. Plants, animals and human beings consist mostly of water (about two-thirds of the human body is water). You'll see why the characteristics of water are uniquely suited to life:

It has wide margin between its boiling point and freezing point. Water allows us to live in an environment of fluctuating temperature changes, while keeping our bodies a steady 98.6 degrees.

Water is a universal solvent. This property of water means that various chemicals, minerals and nutrients can be carried throughout our bodies and into the smallest blood vessels.5

Water is also chemically neutral. Without affecting the makeup of the substances it carries, water enables food, medicines and minerals to be absorbed and used by the body.

Water has a unique surface tension. Water in plants can therefore flow upward against gravity, bringing life-giving water and nutrients to the top of even the tallest trees.

Water freezes from the top down and floats, so fish can live in the winter.

Ninety-seven percent of the Earth's water is in the oceans. But on our Earth, there is a system designed which removes salt from the water and then distributes that water throughout the globe. Evaporation takes the ocean waters, leaving the salt, and forms clouds which are easily moved by the wind to disperse water over the land, for vegetation, animals and people. It is a system of purification and supply that sustains life on this planet, a system of recycled and reused water.6

The human brain...simultaneously processes an amazing amount of information. Your brain takes in all the colors and objects you see, the temperature around you, the pressure of your feet against the floor, the sounds around you, the dryness of your mouth, even the texture of your keyboard. Your brain holds and processes all your emotions, thoughts and memories. At the same time your brain keeps track of the ongoing functions of your body like your breathing pattern, eyelid movement, hunger and movement of the muscles in your hands.

The human brain processes more than a million messages a second.7 Your brain weighs the importance of all this data, filtering out the relatively unimportant. This screening function is what allows you to focus and operate effectively in your world. The brain functions differently than other organs. There is an intelligence to it, the ability to reason, to produce feelings, to dream and plan, to take action, and relate to other people.

The eye...can distinguish among seven million colors. It has automatic focusing and handles an astounding 1.5 million messages -- simultaneously.8 Evolution focuses on mutations and changes from and within existing organisms. Yet evolution alone does not fully explain the initial source of the eye or the brain -- the start of living organisms from nonliving matter.

2. The universe had a start - what caused it?

Scientists are convinced that our universe began with one enormous explosion of energy and light, which we now call the Big Bang. This was the singular start to everything that exists: the beginning of the universe, the start of space, and even the initial start of time itself.

Astrophysicist Robert Jastrow, a self-described agnostic, stated, ""The seed of everything that has happened in the Universe was planted in that first instant; every star, every planet and every living creature in the Universe came into being as a result of events that were set in motion in the moment of the cosmic explosion...The Universe flashed into being, and we cannot find out what caused that to happen.""9

Steven Weinberg, a Nobel laureate in Physics, said at the moment of this explosion, ""the universe was about a hundred thousands million degrees Centigrade...and the universe was filled with light.""10

The universe has not always existed. It had a start...what caused that? Scientists have no explanation for the sudden explosion of light and matter.

3. The universe operates by uniform laws of nature. Why does it?
Much of life may seem uncertain, but look at what we can count on day after day: gravity remains consistent, a hot cup of coffee left on a counter will get cold, the earth rotates in the same 24 hours, and the speed of light doesn't change -- on earth or in galaxies far from us.

How is it that we can identify laws of nature that never change? Why is the universe so orderly, so reliable?

""The greatest scientists have been struck by how strange this is. There is no logical necessity for a universe that obeys rules, let alone one that abides by the rules of mathematics. This astonishment springs from the recognition that the universe doesn't have to behave this way. It is easy to imagine a universe in which conditions change unpredictably from instant to instant, or even a universe in which things pop in and out of existence.""11

Richard Feynman, a Nobel Prize winner for quantum electrodynamics, said, ""Why nature is mathematical is a mystery...The fact that there are rules at all is a kind of miracle.""12

4. The DNA code informs, programs a cell's behavior.

All instruction, all teaching, all training comes with intent. Someone who writes an instruction manual does so with purpose. Did you know that in every cell of our bodies there exists a very detailed instruction code, much like a miniature computer program? As you may know, a computer program is made up of ones and zeros, like this: 110010101011000. The way they are arranged tell the computer program what to do. The DNA code in each of our cells is very similar. It's made up of four chemicals that scientists abbreviate as A, T, G, and C. These are arranged in the human cell like this: CGTGTGACTCGCTCCTGAT and so on. There are three billion of these letters in every human cell!!

Well, just like you can program your phone to beep for specific reasons, DNA instructs the cell. DNA is a three-billion-lettered program telling the cell to act in a certain way. It is a full instruction manual.13

Why is this so amazing? One has to ask....how did this information program wind up in each human cell? These are not just chemicals. These are chemicals that instruct, that code in a very detailed way exactly how the person's body should develop.

Natural, biological causes are completely lacking as an explanation when programmed information is involved. You cannot find instruction, precise information like this, without someone intentionally constructing it.

5. We know God exists because he pursues us. He is constantly initiating and seeking for us to come to him.
I was an atheist at one time. And like many atheists, the issue of people believing in God bothered me greatly. What is it about atheists that we would spend so much time, attention, and energy refuting something that we don't believe even exists?! What causes us to do that? When I was an atheist, I attributed my intentions as caring for those poor, delusional people...to help them realize their hope was completely ill-founded. To be honest, I also had another motive. As I challenged those who believed in God, I was deeply curious to see if they could convince me otherwise. Part of my quest was to become free from the question of God. If I could conclusively prove to believers that they were wrong, then the issue is off the table, and I would be free to go about my life.

I didn't realize that the reason the topic of God weighed so heavily on my mind, was because God was pressing the issue. I have come to find out that God wants to be known. He created us with the intention that we would know him. He has surrounded us with evidence of himself and he keeps the question of his existence squarely before us. It was as if I couldn't escape thinking about the possibility of God. In fact, the day I chose to acknowledge God's existence, my prayer began with, ""Ok, you win..."" It might be that the underlying reason atheists are bothered by people believing in God is because God is actively pursuing them.

I am not the only one who has experienced this. Malcolm Muggeridge, socialist and philosophical author, wrote, ""I had a notion that somehow, besides questing, I was being pursued."" C.S. Lewis said he remembered, ""...night after night, feeling whenever my mind lifted even for a second from my work, the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet. I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed: perhaps, that night, the most dejected and reluctant convert in all of England.""

Lewis went on to write a book titled, ""Surprised by Joy"" as a result of knowing God. I too had no expectations other than rightfully admitting God's existence. Yet over the following several months, I became amazed by his love for me.",1,1741054320.0,exmuslim,2,1.0,False

1j2zvos,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1j2zvos/movie_type_of_love_6_years_later/,[Movie Type of Love] 6 Years Later,"Hi all, I am confessing my feelings to an ex from 6 years ago on Sunday. I have mixed feelings about it, but also know I need to do this‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll call this girl A for the sake of the post.

For background, I met A back in 2018 and we were friends for probably a month before officially started dating. What followed was what can only be described as ‚Äúin the movies‚Äù type of love‚Ä¶ the relationship was amazing. Sure, we were both young, but I think we both knew it was special and a serious thing between us. 

Fast forward four months in, she gets sick for like a month, has a loved one pass away, and gets overwhelmed with school and life. She ends things and explains that she has way too much going on to handle a serious relationship, and that when things get deep and emotional she tends to shut down. A couple weeks later we get into an argument and I say some things I am not proud of‚Ä¶ she asked for space and we stopped talking for a few months. We end up picking things up again and are friends. About 9 months post breakup, i am not over the relationship, but I start dating someone else thinking maybe if i do that it will force my feelings away. We talk and decide it‚Äôs best we don‚Äôt keep in touch with our exes (especially with how I feel about mine). I tell A this, and initially she seems understanding. But the next day she sends a long text and at the end states ‚Äúi‚Äôm happy you have a girlfriend now‚Äù. I immediately take this to mean she‚Äôs really not happy‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt say it. I push back and let my pride take over. After a heated argument, we stop talking for months. We eventually pick up conversation again and I ask her to meet for coffee as I wanted to explain myself. She tells me in that meeting that she can‚Äôt go through that again and that if we are going to be friends I can‚Äôt do that to her again. I promise her this and we remain friends. Months later I tell her a little bit about how I feel and she responds ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not there yet‚Äù but I don‚Äôt really grasp what it means‚Ä¶ for a few weeks I tell myself exactly that, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not ready‚Äù and then over time I convince myself this is her trying to let me down easy. I start dating another girl, and A unblocks me from an app to see my posts about the new girl‚Ä¶ that relationship ends and I just immediately jump into another. That one I go on three dates before cutting things off because I realize I‚Äôm still not over A. Eventually, I convince myself that A doesn‚Äôt want me and that it‚Äôs over and I need to move on. I jump fully into the relationship with the one I cut things off after the 3rd date. We‚Äôll call her C. I end up with C for 3.5 years moving across the country but still talking to A once a month over text. 

Keeping in touch every month was a mix of keeping my promise not to cut things off, but also I didn‚Äôt want to talk more than that as I knew anything more was probably borderline emotional cheating‚Ä¶ things got serious with C to the point of marriage being discussed‚Ä¶ I always had the question in my head though ‚Äúare you really going to marry C without ever telling A how you feel?‚Äù I would dream of A often, and eventually had a dream where she was at my wedding and confessed to me how she felt. This led me to message A and ask her how she felt about inviting one another to our weddings one day, to which she pretty quickly asked me if I was thinking of proposing to C. I told her I had thought about it but I didn‚Äôt know for sure‚Ä¶ 

Fast forward to now‚Ä¶ C and I have split up, I am living across country from A. I realized all this time I‚Äôve been trying to replace A without ever directly telling her how I feel. At least not everything I wanted to‚Ä¶ the one time I did was very minimal. I‚Äôve realized I don‚Äôt want to be in a situation like I was with C again where I wonder if I‚Äôll ever tell A how I feel. So here I am back in my hometown meeting with her on Sunday. I refuse to regret not telling her years from now, not knowing what could‚Äôve been. She needs to know she‚Äôs the best thing to ever happen to me, and that I‚Äôm willing to move back to our hometown for the chance with her again. I need to know if what we had was this one of a kind thing that I feel it was, or if it was in my head and it was only that way to me. I feel like from little things like the reaction when I first started dating someone new to the reaction/conversation to my question about the weddings indicates she has some type of feeling somewhere about it‚Ä¶ she hasn‚Äôt really dated that much as far as I know, and I know I‚Äôm not interested in anyone where I am now‚Ä¶ I know what I want, and it‚Äôs her. 

Where I am struggling is I‚Äôm going back and forth with even saying anything. I‚Äôve been telling myself for months now I need to say this, and I need to do this, and I even flew all the way out here. But I‚Äôm doubting it now. Because I know it‚Äôs a lot all at once and after 4 years of physically not even seeing each other (we saw each other once this past December) I need to know this to either work with her on it, or move on my own. I‚Äôm scared because I am worried about coming to the conclusion that she and I shouldn‚Äôt be friends because it‚Äôs preventing me from moving on, in which I‚Äôd be breaking my promise‚Ä¶ some days I feel like I just need to go meet with her and be friends and keep things good and not bring up anything that would be stupid... But at the same time I think it‚Äôs everything‚Ä¶ any advice is welcome because I am talking myself out of it and also need to try to make this a confession that expresses how I feel, but also does not come across as weird or creepy‚Ä¶ I suppose if she doesn‚Äôt have feelings it might come across that way anyways considering the time that‚Äôs passed‚Ä¶

1j2ztqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/GPUK/comments/1j2ztqa/gp_with_special_interest/,GP with special interest,"Hi, I was wondering if anyone had any insight into what I can do with my GP qualifications and experience.

I completed MRCGP in 2021 and have been doing a combination of GP work and acute geriatric work in a community hospital. I'm not sure I can sustain the GP role anymore - I find the scope too exhausting and find myself disappearing down holes of dispair -  feeling that I'm 'not good enough', when I don't have a specialist knowledge of the patient's particular problem. I hate this feeling of sub-par treatment that I am giving everyone. 

  
I'm trying to think of ways around this without packing everything in and picking up a job in a coffee shop...

I've had a half formed thought about reproductive health and seeing if I could find a niche in fertility treatments but a brief google search suggests that I would need more Obs&gynae training. I'm more than happy to train to learn new skills but I can't face 8 years of labour ward oncall. I had an old colleague who worked in the Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit as a GP - so maybe there is someway of training to do something similar? I think I would really enjoy counseling couples on fertility and maybe doing some simple procedures. 

I think I just need a more focused area to work in. I'm not motivated by money at all. All I want is to be happy in my work (or at least not as completely miserable as I am now) and have enough cash to pay the electricity bill.

Any ideas? pathways? training programs? Any advice would be so appreciated

1j2zstv,https://www.reddit.com/r/thepassportbros/comments/1j2zstv/my_2_cents_and_advice_about_filipina_women_as_a/,"My 2 cents and advice about Filipina women as a Filipino-American man who decided to start dating ""back home"".","I saw this point being made in another thread and I can't stress how right it is. **The fact that she wants to date a foreigner in the first place says a lot.** This really stuck with me and made me reflect on the women I've spoken to online and the ones I've met and dated.

This fact seems like its often overlooked but should be the #1 thing on a passport bro's mind when they're dating and in my experience dating in the Philippines specifically. It's probably true elsewhere but I can't speak on that. Sure, there are some women who just want to date a foreigner because they want mixed babies or are attracted to other races. However, from my understanding the vast majority date because there is a financial aspect to the relationship and that's an undeniable fact.

I saw in another thread some man immediately accused the woman of wanting a free dinner because she denied wanting to go on a coffee date. Buddy, you dating over seas for a traditional woman only to get shocked and upset when she wants a traditional dinner date? Or expects you to pay? You can't have a traditional woman in the household then try to go 50/50 on the check or cheap out when it comes time to pay.

The women I've spoken to in the past and the women I'm currently speaking to will all never admit to me outright that one of the main reasons we're even talking is that I am a foreigner (to them) that makes American money. It trickles in here and there in our conversations. They complain about money from time to time. It's always a common theme. At first I just assumed they were trying to get money from me but after awhile I started to realize... Their lives suck. They have no opportunities. Even with a degree there is no way out of being a slave at work while living a substandard way of living.

They could have a degree, work in a high rise building and at the same time live 2 hours away in a little house with roosters next door living with 8 people.

This brings me to my point and sorry for rambling but don't ever forget that for every story you hear of a passport bro falling in love and finding a wife there are 10 other men being used as a ticket out of poverty. It's nothing personal its just the nature of the game. These women aren't evil or gold diggers, they are just poor. Think about it, would a 21 year old sexy woman date a fat old slob if they made the same amount of money? Don't ever forget that aspect of your relationship and humble yourself.

Advice to foreigners as a Filipino man:

1. Don't ever ever ever disrespect the family. Don't try to act like an alpha male around her parents. You are below her parents. When they talk you listen. You smile and nod. Don't try to act like you're the shit. Once you do that they will just milk the fuck outta you for your money and dump you for the next oblivious clown thinking they're hot shit.

2. Be humble and not ""maarte"" when it comes to the food. Maarte means over dramatic or too picky. Listen, I'm a Filipino American and honestly yeah our food is wild sometimes. Try a little bit here and there and just smile and say oh that's interesting or lie your ass off and say you're full. But don't ever spit it out in front of them and say ""OH MY GOD WHAT IS THAT? THAT'S DISGUSTING."" Again, there is no future with someone like that to them.

3. Little things matter. Asking if they ate yet. Or if they say they're sick, make sure you ask them what's wrong and if there's anything you can do for them. If they say their back hurts ask if they want a massage. This seems like common sense but Filipina women are very traditional and these little gestures mean a lot to them. They like the romance of an attentive man who cares about the little details.

4. They all pretend like they don't like sex and don't like talking about it when it's just not true. This may tie in with the point of her wanting to date a foreigner says a lot about her. Every single woman I've spoken to has been wild eventually. Sure, this may not just be a Philippines dating thing but they always put things like, ""Not for fun. I want a serious man."" or some other stuff like that in their profile end up having video sex with me like 2 weeks later. Not really advice but for those new to the scene don't be fooled at how innocent they try to portray themselves to be.

5. Learn the language. Yeah Filipinas speak English but honestly as someone who understands like 60% Tagalog it gives me an advantage while being at a disadvantage of not being a white guy cause of the language barrier that some women just don't wanna deal with. But this just might be some bias I've experienced because this is what the women I've talked to and dated have said to me. But it also shows her you're serious about dating her if you wanna know some words.

So next time you meet a Filipina woman, say ""Mustah po, ang ganda mo."" and those little corny messages will make her lower her guard or even make her laugh and at least get the conversation going. (It means hello, you're beautiful.)",10,1741053500.0,thepassportbros,7,0.78,False

When asked if I can take my time, k was told I don‚Äôt get one because I wasn‚Äôt on the phones","I wfh, as I was signing into my computer for my shift I could because I needed to change my password. When I enter a new password it won‚Äôt take to, so I had to call IT and informed my manager. It took 5 1/2 hrs to be resolved, and me calling IT 5 time with me on the phone at least an hour with them. The process took longer mostly because IT was just focused on getting me off the call without see that everything was resolved. I would get access to one part of the system and not the other. I stayed at my desk talking to IT, and going in the circle of resetting my password multiple times, adding apps, installing and uninstalling applications‚Ä¶troubleshooting for all 5 hrs. 

It went into my break and lunch. When I finally got access to everything at 6:55 pm, I asked my manager if I can take my break and lunch. She said I don‚Äôt get one because I wasn‚Äôt on the phone. However I was still working and did not leave my desks which I expressed. I asked if I can at least get a lunch. She decided to respond to me. My shift is from 1:30pm to 10:00pm and I‚Äôm sit on just a cup of coffee for that day. 

This feels so unethical and I probably won‚Äôt get to claim my time. This is not the first time this has happened. Another time when I first started with the company, I miss by break due to back to back calling and again connecting with IT, my manager suggested to me that I‚Äôm not entitled to the break because it‚Äôs company paid. She once also suggested that need to get a doctor‚Äôs accommodation to be able to use that bathroom. I asked to see the policy on bathroom brakes or what aux I need to select if I need to step out for 2 minutes to use the bathroom. Never sent me one or touched on the topic again. 

I‚Äôm considering reporting this to Hr. I‚Äôm not understanding why i won‚Äôt be able to take a break and lunch due not being in phone when I was working. I have a record of the amount of time I called 
IT and how long I was on each call. I also have records on reaching out to her during the entire process. 


TLDR: I spent 5 1/2 of my shift working with IT to get access to the work system. Did not get to take a break or lunch, when asked my supervisor was told I don‚Äôt get one because I wasn‚Äôt on the phones. Should I report this to Hr to get compensated for my time worked without break? ",2,1741053379.0,callcentres,8,0.67,False
1j2zo8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1j2zo8v/a_message_not_meant_for_me/,A Message Not Meant For Me,"I was sitting in my usual spot, scrolling through my phone, sipping my coffee, trying to shake off the nagging sense of unease that had been hanging over me for days. The day had been ordinary‚Äîtoo ordinary‚Äîuntil the message pinged on my screen. It was from an unknown number, and I half-expected it to be one of those random spam messages. But the content made my stomach drop.

The message read: *‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trust anyone. She‚Äôs already in your house.‚Äù*

I blinked at the screen, my heart suddenly racing. I glanced around the room, half-expecting someone to be lurking in the shadows. My apartment was empty, quiet, just the hum of the refrigerator and the distant sound of traffic outside. Maybe it was a prank, or a wrong number. That‚Äôs what I told myself. *It‚Äôs nothing*, I reassured myself. *Just some weirdo.* But there was something about the message that felt too deliberate. Too real.

I deleted it without thinking, trying to brush it off. But as I was about to scroll past it, my phone buzzed again. This time, the message was even worse:

*‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have deleted it. She‚Äôs right behind you.‚Äù*

I froze. I hadn‚Äôt heard a sound. Nothing had moved. But I felt it‚Äîan undeniable sense that I wasn‚Äôt alone. I slowly turned around, but the room was empty. Still, the hair on the back of my neck stood up, and my gut screamed that something was wrong.

I quickly called my best friend, Emma, hoping she could snap me out of the unsettling feeling creeping over me. She picked up right away, sounding rushed.

‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúEmma, you‚Äôre not going to believe this,‚Äù I said, explaining the strange messages. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm being targeted or something.‚Äù

She laughed softly, a little too easily. ‚ÄúProbably just spam or a prank. You‚Äôve been really stressed out lately. Maybe it‚Äôs messing with your head.‚Äù

I wanted to believe her. I needed to. But the fear gnawed at me, the nagging feeling that there was something I wasn‚Äôt seeing. I hung up, telling myself I was overreacting. But before I could even put the phone down, another message came through.

*‚ÄúShe knows you‚Äôre not alone. She‚Äôs just waiting for you to make the first move.‚Äù*

A chill ran down my spine. I scanned the room again, my eyes darting from corner to corner. Nothing. No movement. No sound. But I could feel it. *Someone* was watching me.

I slammed my phone shut, standing up and pacing. I needed to get out of here. I grabbed my jacket, ready to leave, but as I reached for the door, my phone buzzed once more.

The message was short, and it chilled me to the bone:

*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs her. I‚Äôm you.‚Äù*

I stared at the screen, feeling the room close in around me. Something was wrong. My breath caught in my throat as I heard a sound behind me‚Äîa soft shuffle. My eyes snapped to the door. I didn‚Äôt want to turn around, didn‚Äôt want to know, but I couldn‚Äôt stop myself.

I slowly reached for the door, feeling a rush of panic building in my chest. The door creaked open just as I touched the handle. I peered through the peephole, and what I saw made my blood run cold.

There was Emma‚Äîstanding just outside, her face pale, her eyes wide with terror.

‚ÄúOpen the door!‚Äù she screamed, her voice high-pitched with fear. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in there with you! It‚Äôs already‚Äî‚Äù

The line went dead.

I stood there, frozen, staring at the door. My mind was racing, but my body wouldn‚Äôt move. Then, just as I began to comprehend what had just happened, I heard a whisper behind me, ice-cold and familiar.

*‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have opened the door.‚Äù*

My kids attend a small ""microschool"" instead of a traditional public school. It's basically 1 big room w/ 20-ish students and 3 teachers. Really, really good teacher-to-student ratio.

Right know they're getting screwed over by Cox w/ a rented Wifi solution which is about $200 / month. And they didn't even set it up with a single SSID, so kids on one end of the room have to connect to a different network with a different password than kids on the other end of the room.

Since I'm the tech-minded parent I foolishly offered to help them plan out an upgrade to replace the existing network. In the past I've set up my brother's coffee shop using Ubiquiti equipment - EdgeRouterX, UniFi Security dongle, and two UniFi APs. It's rock solid, but old tech at this point; and I figured this school doesn't need as advanced of a setup since it won't be serving as many clients.

I'm also going to recommend them upgrading to AT&T Fiber, but was planning to still use our own provided router + APs for performance (set the fiber ONT to passthrough).

Daily network load will be:

* About 30 laptops between students, teachers, and aides
* 2-3 TVs they cast to for presentations 
* An Xbox & Switch they use during downtime
* Some healthy room for future expansion
* Needs to support custom DNS overrides for basic adult content & virus filtering (CloudFlare [1.1.1.1](http://1.1.1.1) for Families, or possibly a Pi-hole in the future)
   * (This is a small microschool so the usual legal requirements for filtering do not apply, but these will be nice-to-haves over their current nothing)

What do you guys recommend? I'm not necessarily married to Ubiquti though I am familiar with it, so it'll be easier on *me* if that's the route they go. I just want to get them something solid so they don't have any more problems with, especially if I'm going to be volunteering to be the ad-hoc network admin as needed.",1,1741053012.0,HomeNetworking,0,1.0,False

But anyways I won‚Äôt be name dropping the franchise but will be yapping abt it in stupid detail. So basically I (used to) worked in some bakery shop. And this shop specialised in selling a specific dessert ah. I joined it through a friend and since I liked the desserts I was super keen.

Recently one of the shifts i was working w my friends, 3 ppl total. 1 person is a newbie and I‚Äôm the most experienced cause i worked here the longest and most.

And I work frm 2-10 so imagine 8 hrs, obv ur gnna talk to ur friends right?? Suddenly our manager say that we didn‚Äôt earn enough that day and that they were gnna cut our pay by 50% of that slot. They pay $11 per house so 8hrs $88, $44 GONE. Bro and I‚Äôm not even mad abt the money, its how he fucking handle this situation. So out of all 3 of us, he went to call my other friend, lets call her A. A is stereotypically pretty, i think shes vv pretty lol. Anyways he go call her abt the pay cut thing, guilt tripping her saying how in order for us to work tgt he shifted the original ppl else where. Or how he‚Äôs paying the new comer(our friend) when shes in training. BRO WE NVR ASK U TO DO THIS WHY UW US TO FEEL BAD FOR U WTF.

This guy has a wife and kids, why r u being so creepy and weird??? Even tell her to come down for coffee and that he will discuss pay w her and what she wanna earn etc. EW?

You cldnt face me and tell me what I‚Äôm doing wrong?? Still go behind my back telling my friend why u dl me and stuff. He even say over 100 smt employees he only like 20 and shes one of them. WHAT IS THIS BIAS FAVOURTISMüò≠üò≠ Just cause i ugly dun mean u can anyhow cut pay and talk shit abt me eh. $44 i can earn back via other job but the fact he brought my name up is the fucking reason I‚Äôm so damn angry. Bias manager, giving slots to people he like and being really fucking bipolar to the ppl he dl. Suddenly can fire or scold ppl one. Fucking stupid actually, even in the contract, NOTHINGG stayed that our pay is based on our performance. NO T&C STATED THAT NOTHING!! So cutting the pay is not okay for ‚Äútalking‚Äù. Maybe if we fucked up or we destroy produce or heck EVEN STEAL, i understand. But cutting pay cause sales nvr hit?? we nvr even do anyt wrong? Not like we avoid customers, and hand and mouth not connected we CAN MULTITASK??? oh my god he work sm he fucking head empty like the damn pastry. Anyways I‚Äôm ranting here cause its a shop established only in SG and idk where else to rant to. In a way i feel bad but at the same time this treatment is unfair. Sorry I‚Äôm not visually appealing but that doesnt mean u can suddenly scold or talk abt me. It doesn‚Äôt work like that. IM SELLING THE PRODUCT NOT MY FACE??

Do I need to buy a different portafilter basket? Grind coarser even though the final shot time is about right? The third option I've considered is dose 21 grams into the 21 gram portafilter basket but just maintain the ratio meaning the output in this case would be about 38 grams

My husband and I are quite introverted,  which we have communicated many many times to my in-laws and family members over the years. Before we had a LO, we made it known that even though we're about 30 mins from my in laws, that we're really like once a month visit type people. My family is about an hour away, so we see them about the same frequency, and of course we might see a friend once a month as well. We like a weekend to ourselves, is that so much to ask lol. 

Now that we have a LO, we re-communicated these boundaries, let the inlaws know that pop-ins with the newborn were unacceptable , you can meet him at the hospital, and then we'd be hunkering down for a few weeks to acclimate to the parent life. We had to turn down MIL attempts at pop-ins, with a ""respectfully no, sorry. ""

Things settled down a bit, we had  visits at an every 3 weeks frequency for a bit, but now the baby is 8 months old, my husband just started a new corporate job and now the MIL is texting him with no questions about ""hows the new job"", completely ignores text updates from him with photos and summaries about the weekend with the kiddo went and just goes straight for telling us about what shes been doing and ends with ""when can I see him, i'd love a cuddle"" now that he's started a job, she texted just me recently (rare)  .. no ""hows everything been going now that it's just you and the kiddo?"" just straight for ""hey, I'm available these days this week, when can I see him for a cuddle?"" there's no offer to help, bring coffee or lunch, its just on me to entertain her while she just plays and cuddles with our 8 month old. I feel guilty, but its getting super annoying. Like I'm parenting on my own while my husband is at work, and I'm still trying to find my rhythm. It hasnt even been two weeks. When she comes by, it's not really chill or helping me with anything, it feels like a formal conversation, I have to hear about yadda yadda whats going on in her life, what books or movies shes watching and its super draining.

Though he had tried in earnest, with tongue, fingers, and his own dick, he just couldn't make it happen. Hed come close a few times...so painfully close, but this was a problem Kelly had with previous boyfriends too. She tried to explain it wasnt his fault, she just didn't cum from sex, but John found it impossible to not take personally. So sex would usually result in an awkward rest of the night, and some of those nights Kelly needed some space in the basement to get away from John's needy attitude. And more of those nights than not Kelly found herself still aroused and would finish herself off under the glow of TV. 

Tonight was one of those nights. The blanket had fallen to the floor next to her and her hand was planted under her loose fitting shorts and her fingers had become slick from tracing up and down her pussy lips. Her other hand held her phone up to her face. She was watching porn, with the volume nearly all the way down. With two floors between her and her boyfriends family, she figured she could get away with it--after all, she had been. 

All of a sudden she heard a jingling and then felt a huge weight shift the couch cushion. It was John's mom and dad's dog, Zep. Zep was a great dane, a really large one too. His last trip to the vet he clocked in at 202lb and as with most dogs it was largely muscle. Kelly was a bit frustrated as she had been starting to get close to the orgasm Johnathon couldn't provide. Kelly was about to turn around and shoo Zep away, but before she could, Zep lowered his head and took a big lick at her pussy. Zep, who had honed in on the smell, made Kelly see stars for a second. She was temporarily stunned not fully realizing what had just happened. On the second lick she understood. Her shorts were loose enough that Zep was able to nose them to the side and he was now licking her pussy. The third swipe of his tongue dragged all the way from the top of her clit to the end of her buttcrack as she lay on her stomach. 

Kelly was horny, but not horny enough for this. She set down her phone and began telling Zep to quit it as she rose to her knees. She was embarrassed as Zep followed her, getting in a couple more licks as she began crawling forward to get away from the persistent dog. Out of nowhere she felt a massive weight on her back and Kelly collapsed. She lurched forward as she did and landed with her torso hanging over the arm of the couch. Kelly tried to get up from the uncomfortable position but found she couldnt budge. Zep, all 202lb of him, was pinning the slim girls waist to the couches arm, and a panic shot through Kelly when she felt something long and hard on the back of her leg. ""Oh my god, no..."" she muttered before she began flailing around to get away. She called Zep every name in the book, told him he'd be in so much trouble, and whatever else she could think. But the dog had over 70lb on her and the fighting was just making her dizzy as the blood began rushing to her head from the position she was in. The dog dick has been spurting precum on her buttcheeks and inner thighs, and her pussy was already very wet from her own stimulation. After a bit more fumbling around, a pitiful, ""Nooo..."" escaped her lips as the dogs cock slipped into her pussy. 

Her first thought was how much bigger Zeps dick was than Johnathon. Longer but thicker too. It felt smoother in a way, but harder than a man as well. Zep was humping the shit out of her small frame too, rocking her back and forth while he tore into her. Her ponytail bounced back and forth from the fucking as her torso hung over the edge of the couch. She was too engrossed in the physical sensation of what was happening to hear the tag on Zeps collar jingle in her ear, or the soft moans that escaped her own lips. Zep was amused by her ponytail that was flying around as he fucked his new bitch and snatched it in his jaw like a toy, pulling back on Kelly's hair and yanking her head up a couple feet. The sensations were all too much for Kelly, she was feeling a familiar sensations as the need to climax built in her. She didn't know if she wanted it, but it felt like it would be unstoppable. Then suddenly Zep stopped. She felt warm jets of semen--dog semen-- hitting her cervix. His cock had become engorged in her, and seemed to be getting larger, but without the back and forth motion of Zep stroking her pussy, her climax seemed to retreat. She had mixed feelings to say the least. On one hand she was relieved that her first climax during sex wasn't going to be from a dog. On the other hand, her entire nervous system was primed and ready.

 

When Zep felt his knot on his dick had grown to its maximum, he dropped Kelly's ponytail from his teeth (causing her face to drop hard onto the floor) and did what dogs do. He turned the tie. He spun himself around so they were facing away from each other, while the large bulb at the base of his cock kept him locked inside her and the two of them attached. In a moment of confusion, Kelly got flopped and spun around on the couch by her pussy while Zep threw his leg over the sweating girl. When they came to rest, Kelly was laying face up on her back longways on the couch. Zep was laying on his belly with his head at the opposite end of the couch, facing away from Kelly. 

At the center between them, their legs lay tangled, and Zeps swollen hard dog cock kept Kelly stuck to him. Most women can't achieve a real tie with a dog, but the girl was slim, with a small frame. The knot had engorged itself firmly against Kelly's g-spot, and at this angle, he was locked onto her pubic bone. The rest of his shaft was not so small itself, and the tip of the dogs dick, with nowhere else to go, was pressed motionless against her cervix. Kelly wasn't going anywhere. She felt a cool breeze across her belly and realized it was from the dogs tail wagging across her belly. She couldnt see her own pussy, as Zeps billiard balls of testicles were laying over her clit. She could however see the bulge in her tummy below her belly button. She ran her hand over it, feeling the hard ball of flesh that was keeping her trapped. 

She could feel every twitch and jerk of his cock. She knew every time he let another jet of cum off against her cervix because she could feel it. She knew it's what she was feeling because each time it happened she could see his testicles pulse up and then down. The warmth of his testicles on her clitorus was a good balance to the cool air his tail wafted over her belly as he continued to wag it. The blood was running back down from her head to her limbs and she was starting to gain back her full sensation of touch. ""Oh Jesus, no..."" Kelly whispered as she realized what was happening. Be careful what you wish for because you just might get it, and Kelly was about to get her first orgasm from sex. She fought it off as long as she could truly, but she had been so close twice tonight already, her starved body had a mind of its own. ""Not for a dog, not for a dog,"" she repeated, trying to hold back. But every little tug and twitch of the dog cock...every jerk of his balls up and down against her clit...""Don't cum on dog cock, don't cum on dog cock, don't cum on dog cock."" Zep could feel his bitches pussy squeezing tighter. It was already such a snug fit and the pressure was a bit much, making his doggy dick hurt a bit as the human woman's vagina gripped him harder and harder. ""I'm gonna cum on dog cock, I'm gonna cum on dog cock,"" she was hyperventilating now. ""Zep I want to cum on your dog cock. Zep, can I cum on your dog cock? Please let me cum on your fucking dog cock! Please Zep? Will you please let me cum on your dog cock?!?"" 

She was lost forever in that moment. Zep continued spraying her insides down with his semen as Kelly trembled and writhed around, her entire body shaking, as Zep gave her the pleasure of her first orgasm. She would have flung herself off the couch if Zeps giant stupid penis wasn't keeping her anchored in place. She had thrown a pillow over her face and was moaning into it like a whore as her left hand kept it covering her mouth. Her right hand was down between her legs. Her instinct had to begin to play with her clit, but she couldn't get to it under the dogs huge balls, so she had just taken to rubbing the dogs ballsack itself against her throbbing clitorus, sometimes stopping to roll Zeps nuts around in her hand and feel them tense up for the next blast of semen. The sensations were a lot for Zep and he whined. 

After Kelly came, she passed out. Just like that, stuck to Zep. Shortly after, Zep closed his eyes and began snoring. Some time later, Kelly stirred back to life. She was in the same spot, and so was Zep, and so was his thick dick. Kelly wiggled her hips to test their coupling but they were still well stuck. She glanced at the TV that was still playing. It was 1:40am now. She had started watching porn close to 12:50am and only a couple videos at that. And Zep didn't fuck her long before he started sperming her up. She figured she had been stuck like this at least 30minutes and Zep was showing no signs of shrinking. On fact, the girls body was so tight, and the dogs knot pressed so firmly against the inside of her pubic bone, that the blood wasn't able to drain properly from his dick. Kelly didn't know it, but it was going to be a while. 

She was left there in her thoughts. Thoughts of shame, and guilt. Why did she cum for this dog and not Johnathon? What would his parents think if they knew their sons girlfriend was getting banged by their dog behind his back? What would her own parents think? Why could this dog make her cum and not Johnathon? That last one was more angry than embarrassed...and what about her other boyfriends? Were they worse partners than a fucking dog? Kelly's blood started to flow again. She unconsciously started wiggling her hips on the dick trapped inside her. Why did this feel so fucking good? Zep yawned in his sleep. Kelly, more clear minded this time, gently lifted up Zeps ball sack and slid her other hand underneath. Her fingers were making her clit tingle after enduring the torture of the muted rubbing through the dogs ballsack. Her other hand stayed where it was, palming and massaging the dogs heavy testicles as he panted in his sleep. There was something obscene and alien about his furry sack that Kelly found was turning her on. All the commotion restimulated Zeps erection, garunteeing her to stay trapped like a slave to his dick as she began working herself to another orgasm. Upstairs was silent, but the basement reverberated the white noise of the TV and Kelly's muffled horny grunts. Terrible sickening thoughts filled her head, like wondering if Zep was pleased with her as a bitch. She wondered if he'd like having his dick sucked. She wondered if she wore his leash and collar, if he could walk her around the basement on it. 

""Please Zep?"" fell on deaf ears as the dog continued to slumber while she used his cock as a dildo. ""Can your bitch please cum again?"" There it was...that word...bitch. She had just called herself Zeps bitch. ""If I'm a good girl, can I cum again on your dog cock?"" 

Kellys thighs began trembling and she bit down on her lip hard. She didn't make a peep from her mouth this time, here entire body was tensed up too much for that. Her grip on Zeps testicles tightened a bit and her other hand moved her middle and ring finger in circles around her clit while a wave of pleasure washed over her entire body. Her pussy clamped on the fat dog cock inside her, then let go, before gripping down again as her orgasm released itself from her vagina in pulses. Zep let out a whine from all the commotaion and woke up, turning his head backwards anxiously to stare at Kelly while the young woman continued to cum herself on his dick. If dogs can smile, Zep definitely was. He let out a short bark of approval as Kellys vagina continued to squeeze his still painfully swollen dog cock. A sudden flood of warmth and wetness filled her pussy. Kelly suspected she may have squirted, but the knot had her so well plugged up that it had nowhere to go, so instead it stayed in her. The peak of her climax was over and her hand left her clit, rising up to grope her own breast while her other hand stayed on Zeps balls. 

She continued to have smaller waves of her orgasm, rocking her hips up and down gently, grinding the knot into her gspot. Her hand left her tit and meandered down below her belly button. The hand felt a slight round bulge. It was Zeps knot--and it felt huge through her skin in her palm... She rubbed her hand, massing his flesh and her own, which gave her pussy one of the most unique sensations she had ever know. She worked herself up to one more peak of what felt like the longest orgasm of her life and then her entire body went limp as a rag doll. Her chest rose and fell with each exasperated breath as she lay on her back, still entrapped on the dogs penis. The poor thing was exhausted. She closed her eyelids and quickly fell asleep, snoring. Zep was still stuck. The clock in the corner now read 1:58am and the TV still threw a pale blue light across the room. 

Kelly woke up about 45 minutes later. Zep was nowhere to be found, but she felt a warm puddle under her butt. At first she felt a wave of guilt and shame come over her, but she didn't have time for that. She had to clean up her mess and get back in bed with Johnathon before anyone suspected anything. She went to the basement bathroom and grabbed a towel, soaking up as much of it as she could before throwing the towel into the dirty hamper that was kept downstairs. There was still a large dark damp spot so she did the only think she could think and flipped the couch cushion before folding up the blanket and putting the pillows back in their spot. Good as new. The clock read 6am, Johnathon would be stirring awake any minute. He usually woke up with the sunrise and then closed his eyes to sleep an extra hour before fully waking up, but he'd be wondering where his girlfriend was. She grabbed her purse off the coffee table and start tiptoeing towards the stairs, but just before she took the first step, she felt something that made her heart sink. A trickle down the inside of her thigh...the warm watery trickle of Zeps dog cum finally running out her pussy and down her leg. Her cheeks turned crimson red at the realization that the dogs semen was still swimming around inside her. Kelly was a quick thinker and she did what any girl probably would have done--she reached in her purse and pulled out a tampon, tore it out od the wrapper, and nearly plunged it into her vagina. No more trickle. She crept upstairs back to bed, ever vigilant for Zep, but he made no appearance. 

Kelly shut Johnathons bedroom door behind her and slid into bed. Ignorance is bliss, and he was sleeping blissfully. Kelly looked at him and felt something like disgust as he stupidly inhaled and exhaled, with no clue or consideration for the ordeal she had just been put through. It wasn't just rape, Zep had completely conquested her entire mind and body. He made her cum. She said she was his bitch. Why oh why did she say that? No one made her, least of all Zep. Johnathon had no idea the painful inner turmoil he had caused Kelly. He stirred awake, and tried to look cute, smiling at Kelly, ""Good morning sweetheart."" 

Mhm, good morning,"" replied Kelly. Now that she herself was fully awake her brain began fully processing last night, and the first emotion to deal with was anger, but she tried to hold it back. 

""I was thinking,"" Johnathon said as he playfully slipped her finger in her waist band and traced across her stomach, ""Maybe we should see if trying in the morning helps me get you off?"" 

""I think I just started my period John,"" she replied tritely. 

""Really?""

""Yea I was just in the bathroom and I had to put a tampon in."" 

""Oh,"" her boyfriend said dejected, pulling his finger out of her pants. ""I just....ya know I'm doing my best. I promise you I'll learn your body and I'm gonna make you feel better than anyone else ever has."" 

""Yea..."" Kelly didnt feel like formulating a sentence that didn't involve telling Johnathon he was a pussy and he was too late and same for all of her exes. Because of their clumsy boyish performance in bed, she was robbed of one of the most intimate rites of passage into womanhood but a dog. A dog that had made her moan like a whore and used her like a bitch. There was that word again, bitch. It echoed around in her brain. ""Speaking of which, I have to run home now, that was my last tampon."" 

""Um, okay I guess. Let me know if you're coming back later?""

""I'll let you know."" She did her best to fake a genuine kiss to keep him placated and then headed out to her car. The ride back got all the wheels turning in her head. She felt like slut, getting fucked by a dog like that. A complete whore. She cried thinking something was wrong for her that her first orgasm was with a dog. Either her pussy or her brain must be broken. And it couldn't have been any dog, it had to be her pathetic fucking boyfriends dog. She vowed to herself then and there that it would never happen again...no matter how good it felt...no matter that it was the most exhilarating experience of her life. No matter that she'd cum harder than she'd ever been able to make herself with her toys. 

When she got home she went straight to her room to get on her laptop and find answers. Why? Why her, why Zep, what did this all mean? She was surprised how rife with answers the internet was. She learned why she had become stuck to Zep and what it meant to be knotted. Her face turned crimson remembering that unlike boys, dogs had no concept of birth control, whether that was condoms, or pills, or just plain pulling out. Zep was trying to knock his bitch up. Zep might even expect to see her carrying his litter right now in his tiny dog brain, a thought that angered Kelly a bit. What right did Zep have to her womb? What caught her most off gaurd was that most of what she was reading was clearly written by women who either fantasized or engaged in dog sex. She expected the posts to be more clinical, or even to look down on girls like her with disgust, but it seemed the authors were dog sex positive. Many of the women's writing seemed to become trance-like as they described in great detail the mental catalyst of knowing it's a dog, the physical splendor of the knots, and the emotional satisfaction of being taking by a dumb, strong, horny male. The comments, on the other hand, were not so generous. ""You sound like you like the knot you whore."" ""If I found my daughter with a dog I'd kick her out of the house."" ""If I found out my girlfriend fucked a dog I'd dump her. How could anyone want to fuck her after that?"" 

Kelly realized a few hours had gone by and remembered the tampon in her pussy. She went to the bathroom to pull it out. She observed it before tossing it in the trash. It felt...heavy, as much as it could be anyways. It was completely water logged with dog semen. How much had that damn dog jizzed in her? She thought now was a good time for a shower all too eager to wash Zep off of her. 

Under the warm water, she tried to rationalize the entire experience. She tried to judge herself fairly, giving herself credit for trying to get away from Zep as soon as she realized he was licking her. By the time she got out of the shower and dried off, she granted herself that she tried to get him off her when Zep first got on Kellys back, but he truly had the physical advantage over her. He simply had her pinned and there was nothing she could do. She even forgave herself for the orgasm, after all, if you designed and engineered the perfect dildo, it would have been a replica of Zeps penis. Right on her gspot? The hot cum, the twitching and jerking? She considered a woman tied down on a Sybian which helped assuage her guilt as Kelly got dressed in some swewtpants. But there was one thing she couldn't shake, couldn't explain. ""Please can I cum on your doggy cock? Can your bitch cum Zep?""

She replayed the words in her brain over and over. Why had she said that? Why had she called herself a bitch, and why had she asked a damn dog that can't even talk ""permission"" to have an orgasm? It scared her how her entire identity was lost on that moment, and she had become in her own mind Zeps female counterpart. Which, for a dog, meant she was his bitch, and her role was to fulfill him. She noticed herself become a bit wet during this part of her thought process, a realization which made her blush. 

Her mind jumped back to the knot. That thick, hard knot that swelled up perfectly in her. ""Maybe it was just the first time a big dick hit the angles right,"" was the conclusion she finally set on, but then a thought that made her heart pound crossed her mind. ""What if I could just get one of those bad dragon knot dildos..."" 

--___---

So basically my idea is that Kelly psychologically wrestles with this over the week. She'll be using the knot dildo constantly and during the day going to extreme lengths mentally to justify it. After about a week of that and avoiding her boyfriends house, Johnathon calls. His aunt out of state is in bad condition and his whole family must go for who knows how long. Johnathon says he needs a huge favor. He needs Kelly to watch Zep for them. ",5,1741052433.0,beastialitystories,1,1.0,False
1j2zg35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j2zg35/movie_type_of_love_6_years_later/,[Movie Type of Love] 6 Years Later,"Hi all, I am confessing my feelings to an ex from 6 years ago on Sunday. I have mixed feelings about it, but also know I need to do this‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll call this girl A for the sake of the post.

For background, I met A back in 2018 and we were friends for probably a month before officially started dating. What followed was what can only be described as ‚Äúin the movies‚Äù type of love‚Ä¶ the relationship was amazing. Sure, we were both young, but I think we both knew it was special and a serious thing between us. Currently we are friends but we live 2000 miles apart (I am willing to move back here if it means being with her again) and there‚Äôs a lot of unspoken things.

Fast forward four months in, she gets sick for like a month, has a loved one pass away, and gets overwhelmed with school and life. She ends things and explains that she has way too much going on to handle a serious relationship, and that when things get deep and emotional she tends to shut down. A couple weeks later we get into an argument and I say some things I am not proud of‚Ä¶ she asked for space and we stopped talking for a few months. We end up picking things up again and are friends. About 9 months post breakup, i am not over the relationship, but I start dating someone else thinking maybe if i do that it will force my feelings away. We talk and decide it‚Äôs best we don‚Äôt keep in touch with our exes (especially with how I feel about mine). I tell A this, and initially she seems understanding. But the next day she sends a long text and at the end states ‚Äúi‚Äôm happy you have a girlfriend now‚Äù. I immediately take this to mean she‚Äôs really not happy‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt say it. I push back and let my pride take over. After a heated argument, we stop talking for months. We eventually pick up conversation again and I ask her to meet for coffee as I wanted to explain myself. She tells me in that meeting that she can‚Äôt go through that again and that if we are going to be friends I can‚Äôt do that to her again. I promise her this and we remain friends. Months later I tell her a little bit about how I feel and she responds ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not there yet‚Äù but I don‚Äôt really grasp what it means‚Ä¶ for a few weeks I tell myself exactly that, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not ready‚Äù and then over time I convince myself this is her trying to let me down easy. I start dating another girl, and A unblocks me from an app to see my posts about the new girl‚Ä¶ that relationship ends and I just immediately jump into another. That one I go on three dates before cutting things off because I realize I‚Äôm still not over A. Eventually, I convince myself that A doesn‚Äôt want me and that it‚Äôs over and I need to move on. I jump fully into the relationship with the one I cut things off after the 3rd date. We‚Äôll call her C. I end up with C for 3.5 years moving across the country but still talking to A once a month over text. 

Keeping in touch every month was a mix of keeping my promise not to cut things off, but also I didn‚Äôt want to talk more than that as I knew anything more was probably borderline emotional cheating‚Ä¶ things got serious with C to the point of marriage being discussed‚Ä¶ I always had the question in my head though ‚Äúare you really going to marry C without ever telling A how you feel?‚Äù I would dream of A often, and eventually had a dream where she was at my wedding and confessed to me how she felt. This led me to message A and ask her how she felt about inviting one another to our weddings one day, to which she pretty quickly asked me if I was thinking of proposing to C. I told her I had thought about it but I didn‚Äôt know for sure‚Ä¶ 

Fast forward to now‚Ä¶ C and I have split up, I am living across country from A. I realized all this time I‚Äôve been trying to replace A without ever directly telling her how I feel. At least not everything I wanted to‚Ä¶ the one time I did was very minimal. I‚Äôve realized I don‚Äôt want to be in a situation like I was with C again where I wonder if I‚Äôll ever tell A how I feel. So here I am back in my hometown meeting with her on Sunday. I refuse to regret not telling her years from now, not knowing what could‚Äôve been. She needs to know she‚Äôs the best thing to ever happen to me, and that I‚Äôm willing to move back to our hometown for the chance with her again. I need to know if what we had was this one of a kind thing that I feel it was, or if it was in my head and it was only that way to me. I feel like from little things like the reaction when I first started dating someone new to the reaction/conversation to my question about the weddings indicates she has some type of feeling somewhere about it‚Ä¶ she hasn‚Äôt really dated that much as far as I know, and I know I‚Äôm not interested in anyone where I am now‚Ä¶ I know what I want, and it‚Äôs her. 

Where I am struggling is I‚Äôm going back and forth with even saying anything. I‚Äôve been telling myself for months now I need to say this, and I need to do this, and I even flew all the way out here. But I‚Äôm doubting it now. Because I know it‚Äôs a lot all at once and after 4 years of physically not even seeing each other (we saw each other once this past December) I need to know this to either work with her on it, or move on my own. I‚Äôm scared because I am worried about coming to the conclusion that she and I shouldn‚Äôt be friends because it‚Äôs preventing me from moving on, in which I‚Äôd be breaking my promise‚Ä¶ some days I feel like I just need to go meet with her and be friends and keep things good and not bring up anything that would be stupid... But at the same time I think it‚Äôs everything‚Ä¶ any advice is welcome because I am talking myself out of it and also need to try to make this a confession that expresses how I feel, but also does not come across as weird or creepy‚Ä¶ I suppose if she doesn‚Äôt have feelings it might come across that way anyways considering the time that‚Äôs passed‚Ä¶ 

If you‚Äôve read this far thank you, and any comments are appreciated. ",1,1741052403.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1j2zfmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j2zfmy/my_girlfriend_will_be_a_hollywood_star/,My Girlfriend Will Be A Hollywood Star,"\*\*\*I have changed her name to protect her privacy from online weirdos\*\*\*

I first saw her in an indie film. Clara Voss. She wasn‚Äôt a household name yet, but she would be. I could tell. There was something about her. The way she lit up the screen, the way she made you feel every word she said. She wasn‚Äôt like the others. She was real. Raw. Unpolished in the best way. I couldn‚Äôt look away.

It started innocently enough. I followed her on social media, watched every interview, every short film, every behind-the-scenes clip. She was still an up-and-comer, which made her feel more‚Ä¶ accessible. She didn‚Äôt have the entourage or the bodyguards yet. She still went to coffee shops alone, still took the subway, still lived in a modest apartment in Brooklyn. She was normal. She was human. And that made her even more perfect.

At first it was just admiration. I‚Äôd tell myself, ""everyone has a favorite actor."" But then I noticed things. The way she tucked her hair behind her ear when she was nervous. The way she laughed too loudly at her own jokes. The way she always wore the same silver bracelet‚Äîa gift from her grandmother, she‚Äôd mentioned in an interview. These details felt like secrets meant only for me. I began to feel‚Ä¶ chosen? Like she was speaking to me through the screen.

It wasn‚Äôt enough. I needed to be closer.

I found her apartment. It wasn‚Äôt hard. She‚Äôd posted a photo of her street on Instagram, and I recognized the brick facade from one of her interviews. I told myself I just wanted to see where she lived. To feel connected to her. But when I stood outside her building, my heart pounding, I realized I wanted more. I needed to see her. To breathe the same air.

The first time I saw her in person was at a coffee shop near her apartment. She was sitting by the window, typing on her laptop, her hair pulled into a messy bun. She looked‚Ä¶ ordinary. Beautiful, but ordinary. I sat at a table across the room, pretending to read a book. I watched her for an hour. The way she sipped her tea. The way she chewed on her pen when she was thinking. The way she smiled at the barista who refilled her cup. I felt alive in a way I never had before.

That‚Äôs when the dreams started. Vivid, surreal dreams where she‚Äôd talk to me. Laugh with me. Tell me things she‚Äôd never tell anyone else. I‚Äôd wake up with my heart racing, the echo of her voice in my ears. It felt real. It WAS real. She was becoming a part of me.

I started leaving her gifts. Nothing intrusive‚Äîjust small tokens of my admiration. A single daisy on her doorstep. A handwritten note slipped under her door. ‚ÄúYou inspire me,‚Äù I wrote. ‚ÄúThank you for existing.‚Äù I knew she‚Äôd appreciate the sentiment. She had to.

But then I saw the headlines. ‚ÄúClara Voss Speaks Out About Stalker Fears.‚Äù My heart sank. She wasn‚Äôt grateful. She was scared. Scared of ME. I felt a pang of guilt, but it was quickly overshadowed by confusion. How could she not see how much I cared? How much I UNDERSTOOD her? I wasn‚Äôt like the others. I wasn‚Äôt dangerous. I jut loved her. Deeply. Passionately.

I needed to make her understand.

I am almost too ashamed to admit it, but one night I hired an escort. It wasn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd ever considered before, but the loneliness was becoming unbearable. I spent weeks searching for the right one‚Äîsomeone who looked like her. Not just vaguely similar, but HER. The same shade of brown hair. The same wide, expressive eyes. The same soft smile. When I finally found her, it was like staring into a distorted mirror. She wasn‚Äôt Clara, of course, but she was close enough.

We met at a hotel. I asked her to wear a specific sweater, one I‚Äôd seen Clara in during an Instagram post. She said that roleplaying costs extra. I even brought a book Clara had mentioned loving. She played along. She was kind and accommodating. I made her tell me that she loved me. That she'd never leave me. But it wasn‚Äôt enough. She didn‚Äôt FEEL like Clara. Her voice was wrong, her mannerisms off. I left feeling emptier than before.

Then I saw the photos. Clara and HIM \*name redacted\*. Some guy from her new film, all smirks and perfectly tousled hair. They were holding hands and laughing, their faces inches apart. The headlines were relentless. ‚ÄúClara Voss‚Äôs New Romance!‚Äù ‚ÄúHollywood‚Äôs Hottest New Couple!‚Äù I felt like the world had tilted on its axis. How could she do this? How could she not see that HE was the problem, not me? He didn‚Äôt understand her like I did. He didn‚Äôt DESERVE her.

But then it hit me. This wasn‚Äôt real. It couldn‚Äôt be. Clara was playing hard to get. She was testing me. She wanted to see how far I‚Äôd go, how much I cared. She was pushing me to prove my love. And I would. I did.

I started following him instead. I learned his routines and habits. He was careless, arrogant. He didn‚Äôt deserve her. He didn‚Äôt deserve to breathe the same air as her. I began to fantasize about what it would feel like to hurt him. Not to kill him. No, that would be too easy. I wanted him to suffer. I wanted him to know what it felt like to be unwanted. Unloved. 

One night, I broke into his apartment. He wasn‚Äôt home, but I left a message. I slashed his favorite leather jacket. The one he always wore in interviews. I wrote on his mirror in red lipstick that probably belonged to her: ‚ÄúStay away from her.‚Äù I knew he‚Äôd call the police, but I didn‚Äôt care. Let him. Let them all see how far I was willing to go.

Clara started posting less online. She canceled public appearances. I knew it was because of me. She was scared, yes. But she was also thinking about me. I could feel it. She was starting to understand. She was starting to SEE. True love really CAN be scary when you experience it for the first time. 

I broke into her apartment again last night. She wasn‚Äôt there, probably staying at a friend‚Äôs place. Or a hotel. I didn‚Äôt mind. I left another photograph on her nightstand, this one of her and HIM. I‚Äôd altered it so that his face was scratched out, replaced with mine. I wrote on the back: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need him. You have me.""

And now, here I am. In his apartment. He‚Äôs tied up in the corner, his head lolling to one side. I‚Äôll wake him soon. I need him to understand, just like Clara will. This isn‚Äôt about hate. It‚Äôs about love. Love that‚Äôs pure. Unyielding. Eternal. Clara and I are meant to be. And \*redacted\*? He‚Äôs just a stepping stone. A lesson. A story to tell our children someday.

I‚Äôve been going through his phone. Clara‚Äôs coming over tonight. I saw the texts. She‚Äôs worried about him. She thinks something‚Äôs wrong. Little does she know, everything is about to go so right.

Tonight will be our first date. I‚Äôve got everything planned. Candles. Music. A bottle of wine, her favorite: a Pinot Noir she mentioned in an interview once. I even have a ring in my pocket. Just in case things go REALLY well. I know it might seem rushed, but true love waits for no one. And Clara? She‚Äôs been waiting for me her whole life, even if she doesn‚Äôt know it yet.

I‚Äôll make her understand. I‚Äôll make them all understand.

This is just the beginning of something beautiful. Clara and I, our story‚Äîwill be told for generations. Our children, our grandchildren- they‚Äôll want to know how it all began. How love conquered everything. Even fear.",9,1741052361.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

The thing is that I had a 9 month relationship with a cap man (cancer moon if relevant) in 2023. We loved, understood and respected each other. It was a great relationship in general but one night my impulsive ass (leo sun) broke things off unexpectedly because I felt like we weren‚Äôt on the same page.

I regretted it, obviously, but it was too late because he said he was scared to be hurt again. He didn‚Äôt want me back. We saw each other a few more times after the breakup but then we agreed to block each other on everything and stop talking (he blocked me, more specifically).

So after 8 months of no contact I saw that he unblocked me so I messaged him to make sure that things were good between us. He said that he‚Äôs been thinking about me too and asked me to go for a coffee. We saw each other, we kissed but nothing else happened. While we were together I felt like it hadn‚Äôt been 8 months, we had a good conversation and it was not awkward at all.

2 weeks after going for the coffee I realized I still had feelings for him (obviously, the breakup was extremely hard for me even though I was the dumper, I couldn‚Äôt stop crying for months) so I confessed it to him. He said he really appreciated me however he said he already had his closure, that he was sad that we were not the same page and that he was sorry that seeing each other reopened the wound for me. I thanked him for his honesty and I told him it was hard for me to see him in social media but I hoped the best for him. And I blocked him.

It‚Äôs been 4 months since I blocked him but it‚Äôs been so hard for me to completely move on. I‚Äôm doing so much better but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that we will be together again. I was his first love (he wasn‚Äôt mine but the relationship felt like he was), we met when both of us were 20 and I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll never find a love like that again. I used to know all his family and I loved his cats. I wish we had talked things out. I wish I hadn‚Äôt broken up with him impulsively. He loved me and he said he never expected me to broke up with him like that. I know I hurt him and it hurts me that I did that to him, to us.

Anyway, I still have him blocked but‚Ä¶ why did he ask me for coffee if he didn‚Äôt want anything with me? I know caps never change their minds but idk, is it different when it‚Äôs their first love? is it possible that he regrets saying that to me and that he‚Äôll change his mind while I have him blocked?

I wish I could move on completely but I cannot stop thinking about him and it‚Äôs been more than 1 year since the breakup ughhhh I need cap men to tell me to stop being delusional!!! and pls tell me your experiences as cap men with your first gf",3,1741051915.0,capricorns,5,1.0,False

**TL;DR: I bought this machine 3 weeks ago and its having mechanical issues. Customer service is exchanging it and were very nice and easy to work with.**

I'm posting this to make the community aware of the process. First of all the machine is pretty awesome, however issues this early are concerning. Customer service over the phone was really helpful overall.

I bought the machine 21 days ago. I haven't made a lot of coffee on it, maybe 10 -15 cups. Suddenly, the machine was no longer frothing or steaming milk. I figured it was too early to have a blockage on the steam wand but I ran the cleaning guide and made sure it was not blocked. then I noticed that a lot of steam is produced in the group head but no steam would come out of the tip. Judging by the sounds, it seems like there might be a valve that isn't diverting hot water to the steam wand.

I called Breville and they started a video call (kinda cool) and they confirmed that this wasn't an issue we could troubleshoot. I was offered an exchange, a repair service, or a refund. I'm not sure who would choose a repair service on a brand new machine, so I chose the return. I didn't ask the rep if the exchange is a new machine or a refurb.

For the exchange, they offer two options: you can return the old one and once they receive it they will ship out a new one or they can ship an exchange immediately and place a temporary hold on your card for a fraction of the machines cost. This dissuades users from keeping both machines. I chose the latter. Once the new one arrives I will send the old one.

Some comments on the Breville website experience: They seem to have disconnected systems. The main website allows google/apple login but the support side requires a dedicated log in. This might throw some users for a loop. The telephone IVR also announces different service hours (Mon 6a - 2p PST, Tue - Fri 6a - 4p PST) but the website says M - F 8a - 5p PST. I found it a little annoying that there is no service on the weekend.

A note on their policies: you have 30 days to return the machine for a refund if you choose to, however you have 90 days to return the machine or get an exchange if there is a mechanical issue with the product. when you receive the exchange, the clock resets on the 30 or 90 days.

I chose to get an extended 4 year warranty through Mulberry. I will post if I ever use them. On a machine in this price range with poor customer-side repairability, I would suggest getting it for peace of mind, but everyone's level of risk tolerance is unique.

I went down the rabbit hole of exploring entry to mid range espresso setups to super autos and ultimately landed on this for it's ease of use. I don't want a fancy and loud grinder, I don't want to spend a ton of time calibrating shots and becoming an espresso scientist. The machine is truly impressive, however I now have quality concerns. I hope this helps someone out there.",3,1741051769.0,BrevilleCoffee,2,1.0,False

My husband doesn‚Äôt want to eat at the dinner table.,"My husband & I are in our first year of marriage. I grew up eating dinner at the table and he grew up mostly eating dinner on couches at the tv. I'm pretty easy going so since we've gotten together, I've been eating at the tv. 

It's gotten harder and harder. Some nights I feel mad that he doesn't want to sit and eat at the table and focus on the food I worked hard to cook. Sometimes I feel upset that I have to stoop low to try to eat off the coffee table. I don't pay any attention to the show because I'm focused on my food, so I miss whatever we're watching in our series. 

I think I'm just going to start eating at the table so I can look at my food and enjoy it and not have to crouch over it like when I'm at the couch. I've expressed to him that I want to eat at the table, and sometimes he will to appease me. But this feels like a very fundamental difference that will probably always be a struggle. 

It feels almost uncivilized to me to eat at the tv. Like there isn't a respect for the meal. I realize this was the dinner time culture I grew up with. Sometimes I'd sit with my family at the dinner table for three hours just talking. My husband did not have that experience... his family has trouble making daily conversation and feel tired after work so sitting down at the tv is just nice for them. 

Can anyone relate?? I just wish this weren't a thing. I want our marriage to have the dinner time culture that I was raised with. I miss it. Am I overreacting? 

*Also I'm new to Reddit so idk if ""AIO"" is the best category for this issue. I am not even ""reacting"" much because I suppress most negative feelings until they blow up outwardly.*",8,1741051607.0,AmIOverreacting,46,0.79,False

I think, when I'm most honest with myself, my best times have been with a similar spirit and shared ambition rather than the attempt of making some sort of complex human relationship out of something. So, before I make a decision, I thought I should put chance out for the test once more. I'm seeking some awesome person who wants to go splits on an adventure, the likes of which could include:  
\- yes, buying that cabin in the woods and having a self sustaining garden and perhaps even marketable foodstuffs. We'd chop wood and have some quail or something.   
\- open a candy/sweet shop, maybe with direct from growers sourced chocolates, coffees, and teas in a cute little village or town somewhere.  
\- a greenhouse nursery  
\- some sort of traveling and working thing, where we do different projects together across the world or the county.   
\- get really techie and build a retro arcade with some crazy vr rooms.  
I'm basically trying to leave the door open to anyone who know what they're willing to walk away from and really adventure.

My most bothersome symptoms are CONSTANT crying spells (I have not gone a day without crying as long as I can remember) and it feels completely out of control. The worst thing about having my brain is that I will always cry and make every situation ‚Äúabout me‚Äù even if I don‚Äôt want to. Example: I accidentally started sobbing at the coffee shop with my friend today and even though she is going through a hard time she felt the need to console ME. It‚Äôs a lot of work for people. I can‚Äôt stop the tears no matter how much I try. My anxiety and fear about everything, people‚Äôs intentions, uncertainty of the future is dialed up to 11. I get really scared and it‚Äôs impossible to listen to reason, I just feel like I‚Äôm dying every single day and I‚Äôm terrified. Everything makes me cry. I feel like I don‚Äôt understand life as it is happening to me, or as I make it. It‚Äôs hard for people to be around me and they are scared of me. I‚Äôm losing my boyfriend and my sister. I really love them and I‚Äôm a gentle soul and just want to stop suffering so greatly. If I can stop crying maybe they‚Äôll want to be around me more and feel like I‚Äôm not so selfish. 


That being said, I have tried so much medicine. 

Prozac- didn‚Äôt hurt. Didn‚Äôt help. 
Zoloft- didn‚Äôt help. Tummy issues. 
Wellbutrin- I have no idea. Maybe it‚Äôs helping a small amount? 
Seroquel- gained weight and had worse crying fits 
Abilify: felt like I wasn‚Äôt real and ruined Christmas dinner because I was throwing up and crying 
Lamotragine/ lamictal: got the rash 


On Wellbutrin 150 only rn. (If I go up in dosage I always get blurred vision) I‚Äôm unsure if it helps. For different med trials I‚Äôve been on and off it but my whole family takes it so for genetic sake I feel like it has to be helping a little if it helps them (not always true but I‚Äôm scared to be off it regardless) 
She‚Äôs putting me on latuda but I‚Äôm nervous.

I am about to graduate college in two months (if I can manage to handle this crazy amount of work I have to do) and life is supposed to get really uncertain in a second. I am so nervous to try another medication after my experiences because I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll crash out and kill myself before graduation. I‚Äôm so close to losing everyone, I don‚Äôt know if they could handle another med trial. 

If anyone is reading this I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre on this sub Reddit and that you feel pain too. Please let me know if latuda helped you with similar issues

I am a 30 year old hetero-romantic sex repulsed man. I'm on the large side but am trying to lose weight. I am quite introverted (and am autistic T\_T) so social communication has never been a strong suit of mine. I also have minimal dating experience as my goto move to flirt with someone I like has been to *run away as far and as fast as physically possible, don't look back*.

I am a big geek who likes reading books and manga, playing games and making digital art. Recently, my media of choice has comprised of reading witch-hat atelier, playing random old games on my steam deck and watching severance. I love fantasy, d&d, scifi and video games and I honestly don't care if people think it's childish. I'd rather be childish and happy than be sad conforming to someone else's idea of what it means to ""be an adult.""

I'm not a big fan of outside activities such as traveling or going to things like concerts. If I had a choice between seeing a band I like live on stage vs just listening to them with headphones comfy at home drinking a nice coffee, you know what I'm picking.

It always feels like I'm crazy when I say this, but I think that cuddling is actually a much better indicator of affection than sex is. Plenty of people screw strangers with no strings attached, but when's the last time you really cuddled with someone you didn't care for? To me, real love is spending a day snuggled up in a blanket in front of a television that you're barely even watching. It's getting tired and napping in eachothers arms. It's waking up to your partner sleeping on your arm, but refusing to get up because that would wake them and you'd rather just watch them sleep. The world thinks true love is in the bedrooms under the sheets, but I think it's in living the mundane happenings of day to day life but being happy with it because you can be with them in it.

I know that alot of these things don't make stand out much, but I just don't stand out much to begin with. I know, I'm just boring old white bread and I'm sorry. If I could be anything else but white bread, I would.

If you've experienced the profound pain of losing a loved one through divorce or death, this sensation of isolation can creep in, leaving you feeling adrift. You're not alone in this struggle. Many people find themselves grappling with feelings of loneliness after such significant life changes. But the good news is that you can reclaim your sense of connection and joy.

In this blog post, we'll delve into the emotional landscape of isolation and provide seven actionable steps to help you reconnect with friends, family, and, most importantly, yourself. By the end, you'll discover practical ways to move beyond isolation and embrace a new chapter in your life.

**The Weight of Isolation**

Isolation can feel like a heavy cloak, wrapping around you and making even the simplest tasks seem daunting. Losing a loved one is not just about saying goodbye; it can also mean saying goodbye to a part of your identity and the connections that once defined you. Whether it's a partner who has left or a cherished family member who has passed away, the resulting loneliness can leave you feeling like a ghost in your own life.

**Understanding Isolation**

When you‚Äôre grieving, your emotional energy is depleted, making social interactions feel overwhelming. You might feel misunderstood or worry that others won‚Äôt know how to respond to your pain. This can lead to withdrawing from social situations, further deepening feelings of loneliness.

**Statistics to Consider:** According to the [American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org), nearly 50% of people report feeling isolated after losing a loved one. This statistic underscores just how common and significant these feelings can be.

But isolation doesn‚Äôt have to be your new normal. Understanding how to navigate this challenging period can empower you to rebuild your connections and rediscover joy. So, let‚Äôs embark on this journey together!

**Why Does Isolation Happen?**

When experiencing loss, several factors contribute to feelings of isolation:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Emotional Exhaustion:** Grief can be draining, making social interactions seem like an additional burden.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Fear of Judgment:** You might worry that friends or family won‚Äôt understand your feelings or may even avoid you out of discomfort.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Loss of Shared Activities:** If your loved one was your primary companion for activities, their absence can make those activities feel empty or uninviting.

**Questions for Reflection:**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Have you noticed yourself pulling away from friends and family since your loss?

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† What emotions do you experience when you think about reaching out to others?

**The Value Proposition**

This blog post will explore seven effective strategies to combat isolation. These tips aren‚Äôt just about keeping busy but about fostering genuine connections and nurturing your emotional well-being. By implementing these steps, you‚Äôll feel less isolated and rediscover a sense of purpose and joy in your life.

**1. Reach Out to Old Friends**

Sometimes, the first step to overcoming isolation is simply reconnecting with those you‚Äôve lost touch with. Old friends can provide a sense of familiarity and comfort.

**Personal Anecdote:** After my divorce, I reached out to a college friend I hadn‚Äôt talked to in years. Our conversation flowed effortlessly, and I felt an instant sense of relief and connection. We made plans to meet up regularly, and it has been a crucial step in my healing process.

**Tip:** When reaching out, share a fond memory or ask how they‚Äôve been. This can help reignite the connection. A simple text like, ‚ÄúI was thinking about our road trip to the beach! How have you been?‚Äù can open the door to meaningful conversations.

**2. Join a Support Group**

Support groups can be a lifeline for those who have experienced loss. Whether it‚Äôs a local meetup or an online community, connecting with others who understand your pain can be incredibly healing. These groups often foster a sense of belonging and can provide a safe space to express your feelings.

**Resource:** Check out [GriefShare](https://www.griefshare.org) for local and online support groups. They offer structured programs that guide participants through the grieving process, helping you feel less alone.

**3. Engage in Hobbies**

Rediscovering hobbies or exploring new interests can be a fantastic way to meet new people and engage your mind.

**Personal Experience:** I took up painting after my loss, something I had always wanted to try. I enrolled in a community class and met a group of creative individuals who shared their stories and passions. This distracted me from my grief and provided a new social circle.

Whether it's painting, hiking, or joining a book club, immersing yourself in activities you love can help reduce feelings of isolation.

**Question for You:** What hobbies have you always wanted to try but haven‚Äôt yet explored? Think of something that excites you, and don‚Äôt hesitate to jump in!

# 4. Volunteer Your Time

Giving back to your community can foster a sense of purpose and connection. Volunteer opportunities allow you to meet like-minded individuals while contributing to a cause you care about. It‚Äôs a win-win situation that can significantly uplift your spirits.

**Statistics to Consider:** Research from [UnitedHealth Group](https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com) shows that 78% of people who volunteer report feeling happier and more fulfilled. This highlights how volunteering can not only help others but also boost your own emotional health.

**Resource:** Explore local volunteer opportunities through [VolunteerMatch](https://www.volunteermatch.org). Finding a cause you‚Äôre passionate about can reignite your sense of purpose, whether it's animal shelters, food banks, or community clean-ups.

# 5. Seek Professional Help

Sometimes, the emotional burden can feel too heavy to bear alone. Seeking therapy or counseling can provide you with the tools to navigate your feelings of isolation. A professional can offer support and guidance tailored to your unique situation.

**Tip:** Look for therapists who specialize in grief counseling for the best support. Many offer sliding scale fees, making therapy more accessible. Websites like [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists) can help you find qualified professionals in your area.

**Personal Anecdote:** After my separation, I found it incredibly beneficial to speak with a therapist who understood grief and loss. They provided me with coping strategies that helped me process my feelings rather than bury them.

# 6. Utilize Social Media Wisely

While social media can sometimes amplify feelings of isolation, it can also be a tool for connection. Use platforms like Facebook or Instagram to reach out to friends or to join groups aligned with your interests.

**Caution:** Be mindful of your usage to ensure it remains a positive experience. If scrolling through social media leaves you feeling worse, it might be worth taking a break or curating your feed to include only uplifting content.

**Question for You:** How do you currently use social media to connect with others? Is it helping or hurting your sense of connection?

# 7. Create a Routine

Establishing a daily routine can provide structure in your life, helping to alleviate feelings of aimlessness. Incorporate social activities into your routine, whether it‚Äôs a weekly coffee date with a friend or a monthly family gathering. Having something to look forward to can significantly improve your mood.

**Personal Experience:** When I started scheduling regular walks with a friend every Saturday morning, it became a highlight of my week. These walks provided exercise and an opportunity to catch up and share our lives.

**Tip:** Write down your routine and include small goals‚Äîlike reaching out to someone new each week or trying a new activity monthly. Having these planned can motivate you to step out of your comfort zone.

# The Importance of Self-Compassion

As you make these efforts to reconnect, remember to practice self-compassion. It‚Äôs easy to become frustrated with yourself for feeling lonely or for not reaching out more often. Acknowledge your feelings without judgment. Grieving is a complex process, and every individual experiences it differently.

# Reflecting on Your Journey

Let‚Äôs pause for a moment. Think about the last time you felt truly connected to someone. What did that experience feel like? How can you replicate that feeling in your current life? Reflecting on these moments can serve as motivation to actively pursue connection again.

# Recap of Key Strategies

To summarize, here are the seven strategies we discussed:

1.¬†¬†¬†¬† **Reach Out to Old Friends:** Reconnect with familiar faces.

2.¬†¬†¬†¬† **Join a Support Group:** Find comfort in shared experiences.

3.¬†¬†¬†¬† **Engage in Hobbies:** Explore interests that spark joy.

4.¬†¬†¬†¬† **Volunteer Your Time:** Give back and meet new people.

5.¬†¬†¬†¬† **Seek Professional Help:** Consider therapy for tailored support.

6.¬†¬†¬†¬† **Utilize Social Media Wisely:** Connect positively online.

7.¬†¬†¬†¬† **Create a Routine:** Establish structure that includes social activities.

As you embrace these strategies, remember that you are not alone in this journey. Many are walking similar paths, and together, we can foster a community of support and understanding.

# Moving Forward: Your Next Steps

Now that you‚Äôve explored these strategies, it‚Äôs time to take action. What will your first step be? Will you reach out to an old friend, join a local support group, or perhaps dive into a new hobby? The choice is yours, and each step you take is a courageous move toward breaking free from isolation.

**A Prayer for Healing and Comfort**

Loving Spirit,  
In this moment of heartache and loss, I come to you with a heavy heart. I seek solace in Your presence and comfort in Your embrace. For those who are navigating the pain of divorce or mourning the loss of a cherished loved one, surround them with Your love and grace.

Help them to feel your warmth and light during this difficult time. Grant them the strength to face each day, knowing that they are never truly alone. Remind them that it is okay to grieve, to feel sorrow, and to take the time they need to heal.

May they find solace in the memories of their loved ones and the moments they shared. Help them to honor those memories while also allowing space for new beginnings. Encourage them to seek connection with others, share their burdens, and embrace the support surrounding them.

Guide their hearts toward hope and renewal. May they find joy in small moments and discover life's beauty. Let them know that healing is a journey, and they are moving closer to peace with each step.

Thank you for being a constant source of love and comfort. May Your gentle presence be felt in their lives, reminding them that love endures beyond loss.¬† Amen.

To try and get on top of some of the sensationalist headlines going around, it looks as if a new witness to the Old Syriac Gospels from the 6th century has been found in the Vatican Library as a palimpsest of a Georgian manuscript. It appears to be a portion of the Gospel of Matthew.

[https://www.jpost.com/archaeology/archaeology-around-the-world/article-844437](https://www.jpost.com/archaeology/archaeology-around-the-world/article-844437)

To immediately address a claim that is showing up on different message boards and other circles, this is not in a language contemporary to Christ and his Disciples in both time nor place. The Old Syriac Gospels are a bit of a misnomer, actually being written in early *Classical Syriac* (4th/5th century AD and later, spread by Christianity) rather than *Old Syriac* (1st-3rd century AD spoken in the Kingdom of Osroene) -- they are ""old"" in relation to the Syriac Peshitta which one could compare as the ""King James Version"" of the Syriac Bible tradition.

I am eager to get my hands on a transcription to see what variants there are and what light it may shed on the greater Syriac tradition.

1j2ywnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j2ywnp/i_35m_am_not_sure_if_this_is_cold_feet_or_burnout/,I (35M) am not sure if this is cold feet or burnout after 7 years. (33F),"I (35M) have been dating my partner (33F) for 7 years. We moved in together about a year before lockdown, survived several personal tragedies, always trying to make things work, which I took as a sign of strength, but it's been constant work for a long time.

To put things into perspective, things went really south during lockdown. My partner was angry about her work, angry about her life, and got very reaentful that I wasn't as tortured. It wasn't always like this, the year before lockdown went really really well, but then a lot of things went wrong at the same time + she started being terminally online, which then she started to pseudo blame me for the world's problems.

I have a lot of empathy for her situation, as all of her issues are things outside her control. the worst of which is the byproduct of being a victim of emotionally abusive parents. So I can see how she was made this way, and the troubling external factors just brought it all to the surface after she could no longer cope with things going wrong.

I also recognize that I'm a work in progress as well. While I'd never inflict my issues on her, I have difficulty emoting and connecting with people and this is overwhelmingly my only substantial relationship. I can become hyperfocused on my work and forget to snap out of it for hours on end. Also I've got the mother of all resting bitch faces, but that's just kind of what my face looks like if I'm not actively remembering that i need to like 2/3rds smile all the time. The byproduct of this is that my aloofness mixed with resting bitch faces triggers her insecurity, causing her to spiral emotionally.

It was only after she started yelling at me in public and trying to instigate fights in restaurants, that I told her she needed to go to therapy, or our relationship was over. To which her response was so violent, I had to call a help line to ask if I was legally required to have her sectioned out of fear she would hurt herself more. This was the really crazy times, and luckily, it never got this bad again. After she started to go to therapy, she started to get better and it's been a couple of years where I've been trying to remain positive about a future where we both work on ourself and together build a life.


I convinced her to quit her job and leave her industry as she was exceptionally miserable in it. basically her day would start waking up early, crying for 30 minutes, leaving for work, coming home to scream about how much she hates her life, and then get baked to complete incoherence until she woke up the next day to repeat the cycle. We basically didn't have a ""conversation"" or even dinner together for at least a year maybe 2. She has no plan to do anything else, as despite hating her career, she refuses to retrain or restart (even if I offered to cover all expenses).

She's joining me on a major move to another city in our country, and for the first time in a long time, we're discussing our future which i like, but I'm taking 100% responsibility for both of us at all times. She's already a loner ""with no friends"", so I'm concerned about isolating her from what little support structure she has here.

We've gone to a few couples therapy sessions to get our communication back on track, but that's still early days.

Now the event that triggered this post.

I recently went out with work colleagues for the first time I've felt I could in almost 2 years. While out, we met some people working in a research lab next door, and I got to talking with a few of them as I was very interested in their work and love hearing people talking about stuff that they love.

Unintentionally I ended up speaking to Alex (37f) for almost 4 hours. She was engaging, optimistic, passionate, driven, and just an all around lovely person to speak to. It wasn't until she left, and a colleague told me that she had approached him asking if I was single and would be interested in her number that it clocked on me that this might have been anything more than a lovely conversation, but in retrospect, there was chemistry there. (I should mention, as maybe it's important, I am probably about 80% asexual, to the point where this kind of thing is very hard for me to notice).

Then I went home, and the next day felt like there was a black hole that the entire house got dropped into. My partner was angrily, passive aggressively stomping around the house, wouldn't talk to me, and throwing what can only be described as a silent tantrum the entire day because I wasn't making plans, optiming to sit and read a book. (This happened basically every day during lockdowns when I worked from home, and I wouldnt dip out of meetings to make her coffee in the mornings, but its quite rare now)

I've never felt such an incredible loneliness and emptiness, and I realized that this is kind of how I feel about 30% of the time. I used to be a very happy, bubbly, happy go lucky guy, and now I'm just praying I feel empty at the end of the day so I might get a few hours of sleep.

So now I'm here with you, wondering, is this just relationship blues, cold feet mixed with excitement about the possibility of something new (and tbh, completely untested, as 1 conversation couldnt possibly compare to 7 years), or is the damage from the past too much to overcome?",2,1741050730.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

They knew you never caused any *real* harm. Mostly, you used your telekinesis to pluck a feather from a chicken or tickle a cow‚Äôs nose. Occasionally, you‚Äôd pull out something *really* devilish and paint someone‚Äôs entire house after they‚Äôd asked for it‚Äîthe wrong color, obviously, just to make them mad.

Your laughter could often be heard filling the streets, a mix of pure enjoyment and mischievous debauchery. People would smile and wave, and often look the other way, just because, admittedly, your antics brought them joy, as well.

Not the superheroes. They always deemed you a waste of time, a nuisance that needed just one more day behind bars to stop you antics. They always scolded you, told you to stay out of trouble.

Really, though, on their days off, you were friends. It wasn‚Äôt ever a surprise to see you sitting outside a little diner with one of the superheroes, just chatting it up and enjoying your morning coffee. The superheroes always seemed to be fond of the more vegetarian options, opting for a ‚Äúsave as much life as possible‚Äù mindset. You ate meat because you thought bacon was delicious, nothing more.

It was an idyllic life, and you would‚Äôve been content to continue well into your golden years. You should‚Äôve known it was too good.

It started as a soft rumble through the ground underfoot, but you could feel it as clearly as if you were on a boat in the ocean. It rocked you, silenced you in your daily breakfast with a superhero, and drove you to stand. The superhero asked what was wrong. You silenced them.

A moment later, the town square erupted in a burst of magma, spewing molten lava across the cobblestones‚Äîcobblestones you‚Äôd helped shave and place as part of the renovations.

From within the fire emerged a single figure, one whom you recognized as a villain. Not a small-town villain like you, but a true-blue, willing-to-kill, supervillain. You stood, nervous, watching as the villain raised their hand, and your breath caught. In the villain‚Äôs grasp hung one of the local superheroes. Even from a distance, you could see they weren‚Äôt breathing.

‚ÄúN-no ‚Ä¶‚Äù You took a staggering step backward. You were supposed to have lunch with them tomorrow.

‚ÄúGod, these superheroes are annoying.‚Äù The villain tossed the body aside. You watched it roll to an unceremonious stop. ‚ÄúI thought there‚Äôd be less of them out in the countryside.‚Äù

‚ÄúStay here,‚Äù the superhero told you, and in a rush of wind, they flew toward the villain.

You could only watch as the superhero was caught by a hand through their stomach, coughing up blood onto the villain‚Äôs already crimson coat. Your breath hitched as you collapsed against the table.

‚ÄúHmph. A waste of my time, honestly. If I‚Äôd have known you would be this easy to dispatch, I would‚Äôve just built my base already.‚Äù

A flick of the wrist was all it took for the superhero to be tossed aside. They landed at your feet, bleeding out, with no way to help them. Before you knew it, they were gone.

‚ÄúHmm. You there.‚Äù

You lifted your gaze to meet the villain‚Äôs. His eyes were full of boredom, with only the vaguest hint of intrigue. Yours was full of hatred, and rage, and a thirst for *vengeance*. This was your town, and the villain would pay.

‚ÄúOoh, I like that fire in your eyes. Why don‚Äôt you become my henchman?‚Äù

You raised your hand. Your powers rose to their fullest potential. You swore you‚Äôd never do this again, but now, you had no choice. He had decided to mess with the town you called home. The town that you loved and that loved you right back. You would show him just how wrong he was.

‚ÄúWhat, you think I‚Äôm scared of a little person like you? Did you not see what I just did?‚Äù

You didn‚Äôt honor him with a verbal response. All you did was grab onto his limbs with your power, focus it, narrow your gaze, and in an instant, he was gone, compressed into a ball of nothingness less than a micrometer across. Whatever matter he may have once been turned into energy, but even that was contained by your power.

It didn‚Äôt matter, though. You dropped to your knees beside the superhero, brushed the hair from their lifeless eyes, tried your hardest to smile through the pain, and failed. Your tears still came. Nothing would ever stop them. Not even a return to the life you had once loved.

My current grind setting is a 2. That is one over from the left. Always make sure the grinder is running when making grind adjustments finer.

1) If you like Cortado's and want it to be a little stronger, this is my goto for the drink. Do a dual shot of a Ristretto at .8oz, full strength. Then do warm milk at 2.1oz. It's delicious!

2) While you can make an Americano with a single button push, there is no option for a long black, but it's easy! For those that don't know what a long black is, it is water first, then the shot. It will give your drink a different flavor and mouthful than an Americano since the crema stays on top. Just run the hot water option for the amount you want, then pull a shot into the hot water. While it is 2 button pushes, it's simple enough!

3) If you want a larger size Americano without it being watered down because there is no dual option, do it in two steps. Pull a dual espresso shot and then do water after it. Or, in reverse for a long black. Water first, then pull a dual espresso shot into it. For those thinking you can just do an Americano and then add a second shot, you can but you would be doing, coffee, water, then coffee.This other way, you will be pulling all coffee together whether on top or bottom.

4) If you change grind sizes, instead of pulling a few shots and wondering if you cleared the shoot, just run the purge beans option after changing grind sizes. Then, your next shot will be your new grind size.

5) The best espresso shot I have found for flavor, balance, and punch is full strength, temp hot, body medium, and size 1oz. I think too many people are making their shots too large and complaining about it being watered down.

6) You don't always need to use full strength on beans for milk drinks to taste good. When I pull a dual milk drink, using a level 3 on the KF8 for strength is usually good enough. Two shots at a level 3 will be about 20 grams of coffee, which is basically a double shot in total. If you do full strength and a dual shot, you are looking at around 28 grams of coffee. When I use my Ninja Luxe Cafe (semi-auto) to make a drink, I'm only using 18 grams of coffee. So don't always think you need to use 28 grams of coffee for a drink from the Kitchenaid. You might just be wasting extra coffee that you can be saving and enjoy the flavor of dual drinks using level 3. This will be a level 2 on the KF7. The KF6 doesn't offer a dual milk drink option. Don't be afraid to play around with the strength, and don't think you are always missing something if you don't use full strength all the time.

Hope this helps and look forward to other people's tips and tricks as well.",11,1741050389.0,superautomatic,9,0.92,False
1j2yryk,https://www.reddit.com/r/50501/comments/1j2yryk/just_stop_buying_shit/,Just stop buying shit,"It's that simple. A day long boycott is great, but what will actually make republicans look up is a recession. How do we make that happen?

Just stop buying shit. 

Seriously. Cut all nonessential spending. Food, healthcare, gas for your commute are all obviously necessary, but any consumer good that you can cut needs to be cut. 

Is it fun? No. But lets be real -- consumerism isn't making us happier anyway. Most of the crap the ALL OF US buy isn't increasing our quality of life. This is assuming you are somewhat financially stable -- if you're struggling then of course you do what you can.

Want new pants? Thrift them instead of going to the mall. 

Get takeout or coffee every morning? Consider meal prepping or buying a European coffee machine. 

Kid's birthday? Buy the presents in advance from outside the country (Temu/Aliexpress). 

Shopping is a hobby? Get into craigslist. 

Bored on a weekend? Your local library probably has books (for e-reader too!), TV, movies, games -- it's probably worth a trip irrespective of any boycotts. 


Every bit counts, all within your ability. If you have ""disposable income"" and you are not struggling financially there is no excuse for shopping at Walmart/Amazon/Target in 2025. 

If you really want to shop online, go directly to the retailer's webpage and order there in order to avoid Amazon. Do the research to prioritize South American/European/Asian brands. 

All of these suggestions are things I have already committed to for as long as fascism is winning. I plan on spending as little as humanly possible on goods made in the USA until democracy prevails.

I have posted recently about how I'm concerned for another ectopic pregnancy. But I have feel like I have am being treated differently this time around. 

My first ectopic ruptured at my beta hcg being between 1.2k and 1.8k. They doubled pretty normal until about 700 and started slowly doubling but he decided we wait it out. My second we terminated at beta peaking at 377. When my hcg was 377 the previous beta 48 hrs before it was about 266. My doctor rushed me in and was concerned and convinced I was having another ectopic. He did give me the choice to terminate or wait. I didn't wait. 

My beta this round and the experience around it have been so much weirder than my second.

I had excessive bleeding and cramping and went to the ER on the 13th. I bled for 2 full days very heavy with a lot of clots. Spotted for 2 more days. I have not had spotting since. I never did get the coffee grounds that I did in my first two. But still very concerning. 
I went to the ER on the 19th with severe pain in my ovary. I asked to be treated with methotrexate then and they absolutely refused and sent me home. 
My pain has subsided quite a bit but I still do have some persistent shoulder pain. 

The doctor told me today he isn't worried at all about the betas, and said we still can't rule out an ectopic yet. But I feel like the urgency is no longer there to do what I feel like is in the best interest to myself. 

I have called several abortion clinics around me and they also said they can not perform any procedures until it's confirmed on an ultrasound. Apparently it's a dirty tactic to make women change their minds once they see the baby. 

I was just advised to keep alert for pain and we will continue next week. 
I only have one tube left and don't understand what is going on. 
I have an ultrasound appointment today but with hcg being low at 782 I highly doubt either ectopic or viable pregnancy can be spotted. 

Is anyone else feeling the pressure from the health care system to wait?

""Mia has lived a life of hardship. Orphaned at a young age, she was later betrayed by an ex who stole her money, leaving her homeless. Despite her circumstances, she is intelligent and talented. Her life takes an unexpected turn when she is discovered by Eric, a wealthy billionaire who hires her. Eric impresses Mia by remembering small details about her, but she later learns that his assistant, Jack, was feeding him those details.

Eric, a notorious womanizer, had once been married to Jennifer, a woman who struggled with infertility and relied on anxiety medication. Instead of supporting her, Eric abandoned her. Jack, needing money for his mother‚Äôs medical treatment, took odd jobs from Eric‚Äîone of which included helping him manipulate Mia. But Jack eventually falls in love with Mia. Overcome with guilt, he confesses his role in Eric‚Äôs deception. Mia forgives him, and they marry.

Years later, their marriage begins to fall apart. Jack resents Mia for not being there when his mother was dying, while Mia suffers a miscarriage, only to receive an indifferent response from Jack. As the distance between them grows, Mia seeks comfort in an affair with Taylor, a pharmacist who provides her with anxiety medication. But when Jack uncovers the affair, he makes a shocking revelation‚ÄîTaylor never existed. No one but Mia has ever seen him.

Struggling to make sense of reality, Mia confides in her therapist, Dr. Peter. A chance encounter with an old friend, Harper, at the supermarket shatters everything. Taylor was real. Jack had manipulated her into believing otherwise. He had fabricated videos and used his knowledge of anxiety medication‚Äîslipping it into Mia‚Äôs coffee to make her drowsy and confused. Even Dr. Peter was no therapist, just a friend of Jack‚Äôs helping him maintain the illusion.

Devastated but appearing to forgive Jack, Mia secretly plots revenge. With Taylor‚Äôs help, she fakes his death and plants evidence to frame Jack. They flee to Puerto Rico with Jack‚Äôs money and their daughter, Ayla. But Mia‚Äôs revenge is short-lived. She discovers Taylor has been cheating on her with a wealthy woman, Linda Baldwin, whose father invests $5 million in a business deal with him.

Mia plays along, acting affectionate until she gains access to Taylor‚Äôs banking details. Then, in one final move, she transfers all his money into her own account, takes Ayla, and vanishes back to the States. Before disappearing, she sends an anonymous tip to the police proving Jack‚Äôs innocence.

Jack is released from prison and soon learns that Mia has secretly transferred $5 million to his account‚Äîproof that, despite everything, she still loves him. Determined to find her, he searches until he finally spots her at a bus stop with Ayla. When their eyes meet, he tells her he has never stopped loving her.

Despite everything they‚Äôve done to each other, they choose to forgive. The past no longer defines them. Instead, they decide to start over, stronger than before, and eventually welcome another child into their lives.""",2,1741050281.0,selfpublish,4,0.63,False
1j2yquj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1j2yquj/relationship_of_almost_4yrs_ended/,Relationship of almost 4yrs ended,"Hey y‚Äôall, first post on this subreddit and wanted to gain perspective and support for my situation. I 25M got dumped by my 24F gf of almost 4yrs. We started dating in college and this break up completely blindsided me. I‚Äôll go through a timeline below.

We live about 1hr away and Jan 4th she says she‚Äôll come over and we can have a date night. We met for coffee before the gym and in my car, she began to tell me somethings that bothered her that I have been guilty of. She mentioned some guilt tripping and score keeping which I have done and she has mentioned these things before. I have always thought these things were me trying to communicate her needs but I now realize I could have communicated these things in a different way. Nonetheless she is emotional and saying how she needs space and a break from the relationship to heal and she feels she lost herself and seeing some of her friends. I could tell she was hurt and I took it as she needed some distance and to start going to therapy.

The coming week, I reached out a couple times with supportive messages and reassurance. I also texted a few times to try and understand more specifics like what does a break mean or how long etc but she just kept saying she needed time and space. It was hard to stay away and I did my best to reduce the number of messages.

The following week we hop on a call and same thing she says some similar things that bothered her and then brought up the definition of love from the Bible.  She was again very emotional and hurt and I could tell that maybe this wasn‚Äôt just a break. I reached out to our mural friend and found out that she took this as a full breakup and does not want to get back together. There were some other things that happened years ago that I think she also never really forgave me for and they stuck around. This is when it all really started to hit me.

I was traveling for work at the time and my anxiety had already been so bad from not having many answers especially since these issues could be fixable. I called her 2 times in the next two days and we spoke for about an hour each and she really helped me because my anxiety was really bad. The following day I actually ended up going to a mental hospital outpatient clinic because I was physically shaking from the shock and anxiety. I let her know, which was probably not the best thing, but at the time I thought it was just to tell her I was getting the help I needed.

Next day she calls and tells me she is going to block me and remove me off all contact because she didn‚Äôt want the her decision to affect me and she thought I was going to commit suicide. I was not but I respected her decision. 

In the next few weeks, she made a pretty fucked up tiktok lip syncing the sound ‚ÄúI would check myself into a mental hospital, but I have better things to do‚Äù. I was honestly so shocked she did this because I never would have taken her as the person to even do that. She has also created a couple other tiktoks and reposted a bunch of relationship/single tiktok. I have stayed radio silent and not even posted anything on social media at all. 

Fast forward to today it‚Äôs been 6weeks and she has removed all our photos on social media and has not even reached out to just check on me. I‚Äôm trying to take it day by day and my anxiety has been getting a lot better since I have medication now.

This whole situation has been really weird to me. It‚Äôs crazy as well because we spoke about marriage and I even gave her a promise ring and it‚Äôs so odd to me that she never let me know how much these things were bothering her to having to exit the relationship. 
I understand I could have handled stuff better in the relationship like being more emotionally available and trying to compromise for stuff but that‚Äôs something we both could have worked on better. I did not have the resources I have now like there‚Äôs and tons of reading to tackle that stuff.

I don‚Äôt know where this will all head in the future but part of me still wants to repair the relationship. I understand I have to move on, yet I think I‚Äôm still holding on to that potential ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù of working through these things in couples therapy. Many of my friends also say that I should move on and she‚Äôs showing her true colors now which I completely understand is true. I think I‚Äôm leaning more to letting go now but part of me still has some hope.

I‚Äôve got a certain student who rode on a 30% all of first semester, and then mass-turned in every assignment through one or two days until he had a low B. This influx of things I had to grade didn‚Äôt upset me in the slightest, as I was glad to see he had gained some motivation to turn his stuff in.

However, the part that worries me is what he writes on some of his tests, in the margins. In what almost seem to be cries for help, I see things like ‚Äúpraying for a sleep study‚Äù, or ‚Äúforgot this section, sorry‚Äù in the margins, sometimes with little doodles of frowning faces or strangely detailed, admittedly disturbingly detailed faces. Being honest, he always ends up getting the minimum passing grade on each test‚Äîexcept for when he aced the mid-term final, which took me by surprise.

Whenever we‚Äôre not taking tests, we‚Äôre usually doing guided notes. He writes down whatever I write down, and then the moment I stop writing and start speaking, he is already dozed off. He It doesn‚Äôt matter if he comes in with a vending machine coffee, he is asleep for a majority of the class. Though, he wakes up just as many times as he dozes off, often jerking his head back as if he is flinching, wide-eyed.

I talked with him directly about the sleeping and academic performance, to which he just said something along the lines of ‚Äúsorry, my sleep study keeps getting pushed up; I‚Äôll try to do better.‚Äù I asked if he‚Äôs tried asking for even just temporary accommodations, and he mentions he‚Äôs unable to get anything if he‚Äôs diagnosed with nothing.

I‚Äôve asked some of his other teachers (of his FULLY AP/dual-credit schedule, save for a single study hall) if they have similar experiences, and they all have the exact same thing going on in their classes. Only, he is performing worse so in them due to varied lenience on late submissions.

Thankfully, he‚Äôs in that senior homestretch, but his GPA seems to have been on a rapid decline. I‚Äôm told he sits alone in every class, and he seems to be alone during lunch as well, not even eating. I can never quite read the expression on his face, but it certainly never seems happy. He‚Äôs very friendly and well-spoken when interacted with, even giving a smile if talked to.

All of this said, his ACT and standardized test scores are all near-perfect, if not fully. I‚Äôm convinced the kid is smart, but I‚Äôm super worried for him. Do I have any ability in my position to help him? I‚Äôve asked a counselor to talk with him, but all I got was a ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt do much, sorry man.‚Äù Even if he‚Äôs close to graduation, I feel terrible for how things must‚Äôve been so far, and I want things to be better even if the final quarter of the year is coming up.

OpenAI‚Äôs¬†**Sora video generation model**¬†is set to be integrated into ChatGPT, bringing high-quality AI-generated video capabilities to users worldwide.

* Sora product lead Rohan Sahai revealed during a Discord office hours session that the integration is actively being developed, though no timeline was shared.
* The ChatGPT version will likely have limited functionality compared to Sora‚Äôs web app, which offers advanced features like video editing and splicing.
* Beyond ChatGPT integration, the company is exploring a dedicated mobile app for Sora and is actively recruiting engineers for the project.
* Also in the works is a Sora-powered image generator that could surpass the current DALL-E 3 model in photorealism and a faster Sora Turbo model.

One comment on it was ""She should run for the House,"" I concur with that.  
WE HAVE A PROBLEM: This is a well written and thought out article written by a 26 yr old college student by the name of Alyssa Ahlgren, who's in grad school for her MBA. What a GREAT perspective...My Generation Is Blind to the Prosperity Around Us!I'm sitting in a small coffee shop near Nokomis (Florida) trying to think of what to write about. I scroll through my newsfeed on my phone looking at the latest headlines of presidential candidates calling for policies to ""fix"" the so-called injustices of capitalism. I put my phone down and continue to look around.I see people talking freely, working on their MacBooks, ordering food they get in an instant, seeing cars go by outside, and it dawned on me. We live in the most privileged time in the most prosperous nation and we've become completely blind to it.Vehicles, food, technology, freedom to associate with whom we choose.These things are so ingrained in our American way of life we don't give them a second thought.We are so well off here in the United States that our poverty line begins 31 times above the global average. Thirty One Times!!!Virtually no one in the United States is considered poor by global standards. Yet, in a time where we can order a product off Amazon with one click and have it at our doorstep the next day, we are unappreciative, unsatisfied, and ungrateful?? Our unappreciation is evident as the popularity of socialist policies among my generation continues to grow. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently said to Newsweek talking about the millennial generation, ""An entire generation, which is now becoming one of the largest electorates in America, came of age and never saw American prosperity.""Never saw American prosperity! Let that sink in.When I first read that statement, I thought to myself, that was quite literally the most entitled and factually illiterate thing I've ever heard in my 26 years on this earth. Many young people agree with her, which is entirely misguided. My generation is being indoctrinated by a mainstream narrative to actually believe we have never seen prosperity. I know this first hand, I went to college, let's just say I didn't have the popular opinion, but I digress.Why then, with all of the overwhelming evidence around us, evidence that I can even see sitting at a coffee shop, do we not view this as prosperity? We have people who are dying to get into our country.People around the world destitute and truly impoverished. Yet, we have a young generation convinced they've never seen prosperity, and as a result, we elect some politicians who are dead set on taking steps towards abolishing capitalism.Why? The answer is this,?? my generation has only seen prosperity. We have no contrast. We didn't live in the great depression, or live through two world wars, the Korean War, The Vietnam War or we didn't see the rise and fall of socialism and communism.We don't know what it's like to live without the internet, without cars, without smartphones. We don't have a lack of prosperity problem. We have an entitlement problem, an ungratefulness problem, and it's spreading like a plague.""",0,1741049705.0,Gutfeld,4,0.37,False

1j2yh4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive_islam/comments/1j2yh4y/difficult_relationship_with_ramadan/,Difficult Relationship with Ramadan,"Assalamualaikum all,

I‚Äôm a 30 year old female who gave birth on new years day this year. I‚Äôm not breast feeding so I have no good reason not to fast. Frankly, I have not fasted properly in a few years. It used to be very easy for me as a child and teenager- but when I became a young adult fasting just didn‚Äôt give me the same feeling it did anymore and it became much harder to do. I am not a Muslim that prays five times a day. I only pray when I feel a calling in my heart to pray. I can go a few months without praying and suddenly feel the urge to pray again. So my prayers are also on and off. But I think of Allah everyday. I never start my day or end my day without reading Al Fatihah, 3 Kul and Ayatul Kursi. Every time I think about Allah‚Äôs favours on me I tear up and cry randomly. I really do try to be a good Muslim but I am not perfect. I do not wear the hijab, but I dress more modestly often more than those who wear the hijab in my country- I try my best not to ‚Äúwrap‚Äù my awrah. 

I also suffer from depression, severe anger outbursts, pre menstrual disphoric disorder (PMDD) and insomnia. 

I get extremely affected or in a bad mood when I don‚Äôt have coffee or food to keep me going- or to distract me from my depressive thoughts. And really, not being able to eat or drink during fasting month just turns me into a horrible monster. 

So for the benefit of my husband and newborn- I choose not to fast during Ramadan this year.

I honestly don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm expecting by admitting, sharing and posting this. 

I know what I‚Äôm doing is not right but I‚Äôm doing it to survive and be the best mother and wife I can possibly be. To me, I‚Äôve been given and incredible husband and amazing baby. They are my amanahs and I have to treat them well so I should do all I can do to be the best version of myself for them- and Allah will be pleased with me too. Insha Allah.

1j2yh30,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1j2yh30/trip_report_bucaramanga_colombia/,"Trip Report: Bucaramanga, Colombia üá®üá¥","I recently spent a few weeks in Bucaramanga (BGA), ""The City of Parks"", which is in Santander in north-central Colombia.

[Centro Cultural del Oriente](https://preview.redd.it/zpaj3zfujkme1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1001232f95638ba7ac5cf04778dfb979b2a6d2ed)

# Intro

It turned out to be my favourite city in Colombia and one of my favourite spots in all of LATAM, purely because it struck an amazing balance between livability whilst having the typical nomad comforts such as ample co-working spots, modern caf√©s and plenty of touristy bits nearby.

**For background:** I'm a British male, 36, A2 Spanish bordering on B1, and I've travelled across a large portion of LATAM off and on for the last 18 months. I have spent the last 5 months full-time as a nomad in LATAM, predominantly in M√©xico and Colombia. My preferences are smaller cities (generally sub 1 mill) and whilst I like to try out the typical nomad hotspots, the overall vibe just piss me off longer term.

# Bucaramanga in a nutshell

From what I've heard, Bucaramanga has been described as Medellin before it got a bit too crowded. The earliest I went to Medell√≠n was 2023, so I can't comment.

However, it has a permanent Spring micro-climate, medium-high altitude of about 900m (Medell√≠n is \~1,500), lots of green space, bars & restaurants aplenty, options for hiking and a few picturesque towns nearby - including ""Colombia's most beautiful town"", Barichara.

If you prefer busy bustling DN hotspots like CDMX, Bogot√° or Medell√≠n, you'll probably find it quite boring. But if you want somewhere a bit more peaceful, that isn't a complete snoozefest, you'll love it.

# Getting there

You can fly from Bogot√° in under an hour or take a bus with Berlineas Del Fonce in around 9-12 hours depending on traffic. If taking the bus, book the double-decker option (""BPV"" or ""Berlinave Super Plus"") and sit downstairs, it's like a little VIP cabin and the price is the same as upstairs. (Continues below.)

# Where to stay

The best part of the city is the east and is made up of three neighbourhoods; **El Prado, Cabecera del Llano and Sotomayor**. I stayed in El Prado in a very nice one-bed Airbnb for about ¬£650 a month, building had a very basic gym, a sauna and a jacuzzi on the roof. Cabecera is the nicest of the three but the experience in El Prado and Cabecera are pretty much identical. Note that Airbnb will often show properties in the neighbouring city of Floridablanca when you search for BGA - there's nothing wrong with the city from my understanding, but it's just a bit out of the way.

# Where to work

There are an endless amount of co-working options in BGA, but the stand-out place is ""Colorworking"". It has it all; private offices, co-working, meeting rooms and a caf√©.

There are also a lot of caf√©s that are pro-remote work, and my personal favourite was Caf√© Sombra. They opened every day at 8:30 and you can sit there until 3:30pm tapping away on your laptop (they'll ask you to move after this time). Amazing coffee and a good mix of European and Colombian food options. The caf√© was in the very south of ""Cabecera"" whilst my apartment was in the very north of ""El Prado"" and for reference the walk was under 30 minutes.

# Things to see and do

This is where you'll realise that BGA isn't a tourist hotspot. There are your typical things to see within the city like museums, [a walking tour](https://instagram.com/cbyc.travel) or visit one of the city's 160+ parks. But the real magic happens outside of the city:

* **Gir√≥n** is a beautifully-preserved colonial town about a 30-min drive away
* **Chichamocha Canyon** is the second largest canyon in the world and has a surrounding national park and ample trails. For keen runners there's also an annual trail run here. Also a lot of activities on offer here.
* **Barichara** is often referred to as Colombia's most beautiful town but is about a 3-4 hour drive away.
* **San Gil** which is near to Barichara is also another really picturesque town
* **Parque Cerro del Sant√≠simo** is a nearby park with a cable car, view point and lots of nature

There's plenty more but these were the standout options for me.

# Food and drink

There are a lot of caf√©s in BGA and these guys are obsessed with burgers, it's like a religion. I normally go out to a lot of restaurants on my trips but I actually didn't this time. But from passing, there seemed to be a lot of restaurant options with many different cuisines catered for.

On the caf√© front, I can confirm that there are loads and loads of high quality options:

* **Bajo Sombra** \- My favourite coffee shop and also very laptop-friendly.
* **Cafe Forrestal** \- This is a small chain in Bucaramanga, but the one on Calle 48 was my favourite. The others were a bit hit-and-miss.
* **Hey Caf√©** \- Right in the middle of Centr√≥ (which can be a bit much), but great food and coffee.
* **1991 Caf√© | Pan & Pan** \- Quiet little coffee shop with incredible sweet bread and coffees.
* **Aura Pasteleria** \- This is an Instagrammer's heaven. Not somewhere you'd go with your laptop but if you're craving European style pastries, and dying to take a bright pink selfie for Instagram then this is the one.

# Getting Around

Uber is active here (UberYa and Uber Comfort) and you can reserve rides. Local taxis are abundant and all run by the meter.

BGA is pretty walkable and whilst I did read about a bike-sharing scheme, I couldn't find it and the limited information that was online points to the likelihood of it being canned.

# Keeping fit

Running on the roads is a bit of a ballache; it's quite hilly (not crazy hilly) and, like most of Colombia, there's a junction every 25 metres. Also, a large proportion of the parks aren't actually that big. That said, on the eastern edges of the city, the traffic dies down, and you can get some pavement-pounding done with minimal fuss. Alternatively, you have the typical gym chains: Smart Fit and Fitness 247. The latter you can buy a one-off pass for... if memory serves... about 80K COP. There's also a run club with their own caf√© called Running Coffee with twice daily runs, and if you're into hiking & trails, then the AllTrails app has ample options.

There are cycle paths, although they're not extensive and are often used by Rappi/DiDi scooters delivering food. It did seem, from my visit, that there's a decent cycling community there

To conclude: I'd highly recommend Bucaramanga if you want a vibrant city that isn't too over-populated and chock-full of tourists. Perfect for a longer-term stint to get some decent work done.

I enjoy conventions, video games, cosplaying, etc. Outside of my cosplay I have a great taste in fashion. I also like to work out to keep in shape and stay healthy. In my spare time I fill out sweepstakes and enter raffles (that I often win!).

I am looking for a woman who I can travel, cosplay(not required), geek out with and eventually share a life with. But for now a coffee, if local, would be great.

Learn more about me at my website! Since I can‚Äôt post it on here per rules, it‚Äôs on my profile!
