But  this week I felt very annoyed doing the weekend. We 90% spend time at my place since I have my own place and he lives with roommates. Let me start of he is very kind, funny, thoughtful and much more.

It started Wednesday where we agreed to meet after work around 5pm I said I wanted to order takeaway for us both. He responded around 3pm what he wanted and I said I’ll get it so we could go home and eat. Around 5 I said I was heading there. No response and I got impatient after waiting also I was very hungry. So I picked it up went home. Around 6.30 I get a text that something came up and that’s why he is late and he is heading to me now. I got slightly annoyed cause a little message that he was getting late would been nice and thoughtful. He came at 7pm and I was a little upset. He apologize and we had a fine evening. 

Friday i was off and he worked at home from my place. He is free to use my apartment and so with the expectation of just being normally clean. He wanted to make a coffee on my barista machine I said remember to rinse it off after and cleaning (said many times before but he “forgets”) he didn’t do it again and I did it. Again I was annoyed and I was in my office room he took off his sweatpants (he has his own shelf for clothes). He took them off folded them and handed them to me and said boldly “put them back where they are” I got angry and said “I’m not your maid” and then went to the kitchen. He came out and said “what’s wrong”. I told him I was annoyed because he didn’t do the coffee even thought he said he would and now doing this thing with pants and it felt very degrading and kinda like am his mom!. We went out for lunch and had a long discussion about it. He said that since it’s not his place he feel like he dosnt know what the rules are and so on. 

I was a little sad the rest of the day. The day after I had things to do early but came home around lunch and he was at the gym. I wrote I will cook some lunch before he is going home. I made it everything was good until he said he wanted to clean up after lunch I helped with bringing the plates. The first comment he made was that then he cooks he make sure to clean up meanwhile he cooks so it’s not so dirty. I got sad and upset. Like I didn’t clean up because I didn’t want the food to get cold and it felt really mean. He apologized again and said it was ment as a joke. 

I can help feeling bad at getting annoyed/upset at him and telling him off and I feel like a mom that’s nagging him (I told him I felt I was being put in a unfair position). I’m I too much? What do you think?

Revenue: €**0**. Literally zero. 

My days all looked the same. Wake up, open Xcode, coffee goes cold, 40 tabs open (docs, forums, Stack Overflow, some GitHub issue from 2017). ChatGPT open all the time, mostly to learn, not to copy-paste.  
At one point I was doing 16–17 hours a day. Not in a grindset way. Just “one more thing” over and over.

All of this for an app that’s actually useful. It helps manage your wardrobe. Simple idea, insane amount of work.  
I won’t name it because this isn’t an ad. The app works, people like it… but no traction, no money, nothing. Just me refreshing App Store Connect like an idiot.

Then one random night I’m doom-scrolling Instagram and I see a screenshot.  
It’s just the year shown as a progress bar. Like “you’re X% into the year”.

That’s it. That’s the whole idea.

I stare at it, open Notes, then Xcode. About 20 minutes later the app is basically done. backend. No login. No Stripe. One screen. One idea.

I submit it to Apple the same night. I even pay for expedited review (which I never do). No idea why, just had a weird gut feeling. 

Apple approves it almost instantly.  
I launch it as a paid app. €0.99. No free tier. No trial. Just “this is the app”.

then something surreal happens...

It climbs to #10 in the Entertainment category (paid apps). Not joking. REALLY. (Attach proof)

The funniest part? I don’t even know how many downloads it has yet. Stats haven’t updated.  
So I have no idea who bought it or why — I just know it was sitting there at #10 next to apps made by actual teams with budgets.

I’m including screenshots as proof because I know how Reddit works and I’d call bullshit too.

That’s it.  
Months of “serious” work: nothing.  
Twenty minutes on a stupidly clear idea: top 10.

I’m still trying to process what this means.

1qmx55t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qmx55t,Reta success story,"Hi beautiful ladies. I would like to share my success to hopefully provide motivation for anyone who needs help with sticking it out. I started on 0.2 in October-November and bumped up to 0.3 December-January. So far, I’ve lost 36lbs. I started at 194, and as of yesterday morning, I’m at 158 (I’m 31 and 5’7”). I never thought I’d see below 170 ever again, much less be in the 150s. 

I think it’s imperative that I point out how minimized my diet is though. I really only eat once per day and ensure that it’s a healthy meal. In the morning I’ll do coffee with whole ingredient creamer (no gums or additives) or a Celsius/alani if needed. Lunch is mostly skipped. And I’ll do an early dinner around 3-5pm and that’s it. If I’m craving something sweet I’ll eat berries or a 100 calorie sweet treat. This is not a sustainable diet long term, I want to make that clear. I plan to reintroduce small lunchtime meals once I’m closer to 150, as that’s as low as I want to go. Portion control and restrictive eating will really be your game changer for big results. Your energy WILL suffer from it though. 

To be honest, I maybe workout once or twice a week. I should do more strength training but I’ve been very busy with life over the past few months. I do always get in a 45 minute-1 hour walk with my dog every day though. 

First picture is me currently clothed, second picture is my stomach area (current), and third picture is how chubby and puffy my face looked back in May of 2025 for comparison.

I have a question: when I press to extract coffee, the first 2 seconds only steam comes out on the group! No pre-infusion! Only steam then hot water! It was like that from the beginning! Is this normal? 
Another problem I encountered: I used fresh coffee! Everything was very good! Until yesterday when the grinder got stuck! Suddenly the grinder protection did not allow grinding except at a higher setting (from 15 to 17)! Obviously the granulation being large, the extraction was not what it should be either! I bought another coffee and everything went back to normal! Could the coffee in the tank have absorbed moisture? Thank you very much for the advice! Good health!

I am a cashier at a small grocery store. A local mom and pop type. I just had a customer who bought a couple of things and the total came out to about $20/$21 and some changed. He said he only had $19, and will “owe you a dollar”. I told him “I’m sorry I don’t have enough in my tip jar to cover for you, you have 4 can of the tuna, why don’t you take one of them out?” He agreed and requested for a bag. I finish ringing him up and he asked if I charged him for the bag? I told him yes. He said that he had been coming for years, no else charges him for a bag, asked me “Why do you charge me?” I told him I only work here on the weekends and everyone is suppose to charge for bags. He left in a huff and said then he won’t come in on the weekends anymore. 

For context: today when this occurred is 1/25/2026 located in Queens, New York. 

The weather: snowing and windy and cold because we are going through the winter storm Fern, which is sweeping through half of the US and supposed to be the biggest snowstorm in years. Meaning most people are NOT going out if they don’t have to. Which means less customers and also less tips. My jar currently has less than a dollar in there even now at 12:24 PM as I’m typing this out. I am not saying I’m expecting tips, it would be nice, but not expected for me.

And it’s not just one person either sometimes it’s multiple people through out the shift. Or if the customer is a long time customer, sometimes my parents will cover it instead and let the cashiers keep their tips. Some of the customers will return to return the money, others don’t.

And these are reusable bags that are sturdy, the size is the same size as those plastic shopping bags too. In NYC we cannot use plastic bags anymore. This has been around for a few years now so all of the customers know this. How much we charge for the bags? 30 cents.

The customer: he has been coming for a long long time. I’ve rung him up every single weekend for the past few years, so what he said was a lie, because I’ve charged him bags before lol. Sometimes he doesn’t have enough to cover his coffee or food stuff and we’ll cover it if we have enough in the tip jar.

I am currently setting up my workflow with the Dedica 685 and the Comandante C40 hand grinder.



I have now encountered the following challenges and am unsure whether they are problematic:

1. My grind from the C40 is often clumpy, even after spraying the beans with water before grinding. 

2. My bottomless basket (51mm version from barista essentials) is specified as 18 grams. However, when I fill it with 18 grams from the C40, the coffee powder protrudes far beyond the basket (even 16.5-17 grams is still clearly too much). It is then only prevented from falling out by my dosing ring. RDT before grinding and WDT after filling the portafilter do not change this. Only by tapping several times can I get the coffee powder down far enough to tamp it.

3. My dosing ring is at least 1 millimeter too tight. This creates a rim at the top of the portafilter. Is this a problem before tamping?

Overall, I have already pulled a few good shots. My puck looks usually good and lately did not have any imprints from the portafilter head. Overall, however, I often end up with very sour espresso.

Should I buy a more suitable dosing ring, and can you recommend a 51? And should I work with a blind shaker?

Normally, this isn't a problem, but it made what happened next much weirder.

I've been at this job for about 8 months, and recently I started noticing strange errors in the monthly performance reports I'm responsible for. I'm usually very detail-oriented, so I thought maybe I was just stressed with work. But suddenly, my manager called me into her office and showed me the final PDF that was sent out. It had entire paragraphs repeated, and a very important financial figure was removed and replaced with a bunch of zeros. It looked like I had either done the work while I wasn't in my right mind or that I was just careless.

I was shocked. I showed her the original files on my drive, which were correct and had no mistakes. The version history proved I didn't make those changes. It was clear someone was messing with the file \*after\* I finished it. My manager, honestly, believed me. She told me to act completely normal, and for the next report, she set up a special shared drive that logs every action and who performed it.

And sure enough, two hours after I uploaded the final report, my colleague 'Gina' opened the file. The logs showed that she deleted key data and replaced it with nonsense, then saved and closed the file. We caught her red-handed.

HR got involved immediately. We discovered that 'Gina' thought I was after her job and was doing this to make me look bad. Of course, it backfired on her big time. She received a formal warning for intentionally tampering with company documents, and the word is she's now on thin ice and under observation with a formal PIP (Performance Improvement Plan). Honestly, I'm surprised she wasn't fired.

She cornered me by the coffee machine and gave me a half-hearted apology, claiming she was 'stressed and felt threatened.' I just nodded and walked away. I still don't trust her because sabotaging a colleague's work is a whole other level of malicious, especially when it could affect our client relationships.

You Doux acts like a diffuser and editor in this combo. It sheers out Black Opiums sugar and syrupy vanilla and grounds the coffee note with woods and clean musk. Result? The coffee becomes warm and cozy instead of clubby and cloying. The gourmandiness of the vanilla becomes soft and cashmere like instead of edible.

I enjoy making and drinking coffee, going to breweries, hiking, running, playing video games, and traveling. I love all kinds of food. I also enjoy diy home projects and self care. 

I work in HR leadership mostly from home. I also teach business classes at a university a couple nights a week.

Yes, I give permission to use that acronym freely.

Ahem, NUNM friends: You are the ones who keep accidentally saying Mormon and spelling “Latter Day” instead of “Latter-day,” who think “ward” is only a hospital term, and who still aren’t 100% sure what a stake president does, but you show up anyway as friends, neighbors, coworkers, and family.

You’ve attended baptisms not fully understanding the program, politely declined casseroles you couldn’t identify, and listened to mission stories like you were watching a travel documentary with a spiritual subplot. You’ve nodded respectfully during phrases like “tender mercies” and “the covenant path” while quietly Googling later.

You ask sincere questions. You’re patient when plans pause for church meetings, youth activities, or “we don’t do that on Sundays.” You’ve learned that soda is fine but coffee is suspicious, and you still invite us to things anyway.

Because of you, faith isn’t lived in a bubble. It’s explained, clarified, and practiced in real relationships with people who don’t share the same assumptions. You “build Zion” mostly by being decent humans who make space for people who believe differently than you do.

So hats off to the non-Utah non-members. You didn’t sign up for the theology, but you still show up for the people. Thank you.",6,1769377847.0,latterdaysaints,0,0.88,False

I tell you this was EXACTLY what I was craving. It had the too sweetness of swiss miss and the creaminess i was looking for. It is kind of nutty, too in a really pleasant way.

I loved all the names; these were just the ones that felt best to me. Thank you all for the great suggestions, and apologies to anybody whose suggestion I did not choose.)

“We’re back!” came the rather cheerful call from behind Eric. He turned around to see Jessica waving at him, with Quin and Control by her. Eric had to admit, Control looked much better now. She was wearing a red t-shirt with what looked like a leather vest and black cargo pants.

“Where’s Sandra?” Eric, standing up to meet the ladies.

“She’s right here,” Quin said. “It’s okay, sweetheart.” Sandra stepped out from behind her, her scales a light orange sheen.

“Okay, I’ll admit it,” Eric said. “Jessica, you know how to fashion.” Sandra was wearing what a sundress in soft yellow and green colors, her tail through a hole in the dress.

“I know, right?” Jessica said, smugly. “Isn’t she just the most adorable thing in the galaxy? Dresses fit her so well, and it goes great with that color-changing she can do.”

“For someone with such a tomboy attitude, you did good,” Eric conceded, kneeling down. “You look good, kiddo. How do you feel?”

“It’s comfortable,” Sandra admitted quietly before rushing over and giving Eric a hug.

“Getting to be a bit much?” Eric asked. Sandra nodded into his chest.

“No worries, girl, you did great today,” Jessica said. “And you look great too. Anybody says any different, I will personally turn them into a pretzel.”

“Let’s not,” Eric said with a chuckle, picking Sandra up as he stood up. “Control, you look good as well. Going for more of a punk vibe?”

“Jessica determined that it would be better to accentuate my machinery rather than hide them,” Control said in her robotic tone. “I am uncertain as to the reasons, but the clothing does allow movement with minimal restrictions.”

“We are going to turn you into a fashion diva later on,” Jessica said firmly. “You’ve got so much to work with we could do a lot.”

“Well, I’m going to take Sandra back to the ship and let her rest a bit,” Eric said. “You ladies?”

“There’s a few things I still would like to get from the market,” Quin said, “so I will be out for a while.”

“Same here,” Jessica said, throwing an arm around Quin. “Us ladies gotta stick together.”

“I think I will stay out longer as well,” Control said. “This has been an…. interesting…. trip so far, and I would like more datapoints to compare to later.”

“Alright, you ladies have fun then,” Eric said, taking the bag that Quin handed him. “Jessica, try not to burn down any stores.”

“Why would I do that?” Jessica demanded.

“You are a bit over the top sometimes, Jessica,” Quin said as Eric walked away with a shake of his head.

“She is very loud,” Sandra said after a few minutes.

“Who, Jessica?” Sandra nodded. “Yeah, the few times I’ve met her previously she seemed very outgoing, even for me,” Eric said. “Who knew she was actually really into fashion though? That caught me off guard.”

“Is fashion important to humans?” Sandra asked, lifting her head to look at Eric. He laughed a bit.

“Depends on who you ask,” Eric admitted. “For someone like Jessica it seems, very important. Me?” Eric shrugged. “I’ve never been very fashion sensitive. If it fits and is comfortable to wear, that’s all I really care about.”

“Hmmm,” Sandra put her head back down, resting it against his chest.

“Hey, do you like sweets?” Eric asked suddenly as they walked by a shop that caught his eye.

“Ummmm, I don’t know,” Sandra said.

“Let’s find out then,” Eric said, changing directions. “I they should have something Targondian safe in here.” He stepped into the shop, looking around as he saw the advertisements for various types of candy and snacks.

“Welcome,” came a cheerful call, and a Mlamcar female stepped out from the back. Eric just blinked in surprise. She laughed as she noticed. “Didn’t expect a Mlamcar?”

“No ma’am, I did not,” Eric said honestly as he put Sandra down, her eyes big as she took in the colorful sweets. “Every Mlamcar I’ve ever met has been the more serious kind while on the clock.” The shopkeeper laughed.

“Normally, you would be correct,” she said. “But this is just a side hobby that I enjoy, not my job.”

“Ah, ok, I get it now,” Eric said. “Well, Sandra here has never had any sweets, so we wanted to look around, see if there’s any Targondian safe candies for her to try.”

“Hmmmm, I don’t know much about Targondian tastes, but she should be fine for almost anything here,” the Mlamcar woman said, tapping her finger as she thought.

“Do you happen to have any samplers that we can try?” Eric asked as Sandra flicked her tongue out in front of some red candies. She flinched back almost immediately, rubbing her nose. “Spicy?” Sandra just nodded, glaring at the red candies. The Mlamcar laughed.

“So, not a fan of spicy candies. That’s fine, those are mostly for our Cordan and occasional Human guests. Cordans can’t get enough of them, and Humans are a hit or miss.”

“Our tastes vary as widely as the galaxy does,” Eric agreed.

“I’ve noticed. Here, try a few of these, darling,” the Mlamcar lifted a bowl, showing a variety of different candies. “These ones don’t come out as pretty as the rest do, so I keep them as the samplers, since I can’t sell them.”

“You make them yourself?” Eric asked as Sandra picked up what looked like an orange glob from the bowl.

“I really enjoy making sweets,” the Mlamcar admitted, “but my husband pointed out that I make way too much and spend way too much in ingredients for just the two of us. So, on my off days I sell whatever we don’t keep, try and keep my hobby costs down a bit.”

“That’s actually pretty clever,” Eric admitted, trying a green soft candy. His eyes immediately began tearing up and his lips puckered as the flavor reminded him of a condensed lemon. “Oh, that is super sour, holy hell.” Sandra giggled as she watched Eric’s face pucker and then grabbed one to try herself. Her eyes lit up at the flavor and tugged at Eric’s sleeve. “That one, huh?” Sandra nodded, also grabbing the orange hard candy and eating it as well. “So, looks like some of each of those then.”

“Sour fan, huh?” the Mlamcar woman said. “They’re just down that aisle. There’s a purple and a blue one right next to them I think you might enjoy as well, if you want a bit more variety.”

Sandra and Eric left the shop a few moments later, Sandra happily sucking on one of the orange orbs as Eric grumbled a bit about up charging (the shopkeeper had managed to talk him into purchasing about twice the amount of candy he was planning on getting). They got back to the ship just in time to watch as the small hanger bays were being lifted, with Adam talking to someone.

“I take it the drone ships have been decided?” Eric asked, walking over.

“Hell yeah,” Adam said, giving the other human a wave as he walked away. “The Corvette is already a nimble little thing, so fire support I’m not too worried about, seeing as I can avoid incoming fire. So, one of the drones is going to be a scouting ship and tug. It can scan anything we might come across, has cutting torches and cinches, and still has enough horsepower to shuttle larger craft a short distance in case of an engine failure.”

“And the other bay?”

“Stingers.” Eric whistled. Stingers were tiny fighters with variable laser weapons. Extremely light on armor, so a single hit will take them out, but they were small, quick and nimble, making hitting them very difficult. If you ignored them, they could demolish shielding, but if you focused on them then the main ship would have an opening for the big guns. They also had the ability to be used as single use boarding drones. “Yeah, I felt bad that y’all might not get any ship-to-ship action, so I had to allow at least one toy for you to play with,” Adam said with a shit-eating grin.

“Cheeky bastard,” Eric said. “We’ll see just how good a pilot you are when we leave in a couple of hours.""

“Speaking of which, we have our first job,” Adam said, handing Eric a datapad. “Jeremiah accepted it, but honestly I don’t have any complaints.” Adam read over the job request. It was for a passenger transportation to a habitable planet a few systems away, a known vacation spot called Addrius V. Eric looked up at Adam, who was still grinning.

“Okay, it’s a transportation job. Not something I would expect, but it does get us out a bit, and a destination instead of just pointing in a random direction and going.”

“Keep reading,” Eric said. Adam kept on reading the request until he got to the client’s name.

“Shtaran? As in, Head of Station Security, Shtaran?” Eric asked.

“Yup,” Adam said, laughing as he saw the look on Eric’s face. Sandra looked excited, her scales turning a light-yellow color.

“Guess she wasn’t kidding when she said she was taking a vacation,” Eric said, handing Adam his datapad back.

“And she’s going to be surrounded by Reapers the entire trip there. This is going to be fun,” Adam laughed.

“Do not scare the poor woman any more than she already is,” Eric said, trying to keep a straight face. “She’s trying to take the chance to relax, not get more stressed.”

“No promises,” Adam said as he walked away towards the ship.

“Well, this is going to be an interesting start at least,” Eric said, rubbing the back of his neck.

“I like Shtaran,” Sandra said. “She’s nice.”

“Indeed, she is,” Eric said as they got onto their ship.

………………………………………………….

“So, how does everything look?” Jeremiah asked when the crew were all back in the conference room.

“Well, the big guns are railguns loaded with steel-coated tungsten rods, we’ve got three of the Class 2 turrets for missile launchers, 2 for torpedoes, with the remaining 5 being scatter cannons, and 4 each of laser and plasma cannons for the Class 3 turrets, with all of the class 3 turrets being able to be slaved to two separate gunners in the cockpit. All loaded and fully ready to go,” Adam said, cracking his neck. “Also, Stingers and heavy-duty Scout-Tugs, or SCUGS as I like to call them, for our drones.”

“The engines are purring like a kitten, and I have enough spare parts to make an extra engine if needed,” Shao said. “And enough raw materials to make another half a ship.”

“Pantry and cold storage are fully stocked,” Eric said. ""And yes, there is coffee. Actual, Earth grown, coffee.” Both Adam and Jessica pumped their arms. “Also, there are three stills that got ‘accidentally’ installed.” This elicited arm pumps and whoops from everyone in the room except Sandra and Control.

“No bugs in the systems, and we have blueprints for extra weaponry, ammo, items, and various components to make whatever we may need in the moment,” Quin says, smiling. “Additionally, it looks like the grav-gym has been fitted with heavy shielding and holo-tech, so it can be used as a firing range and simulation training.”

“Communications and the FTL drive are both functional and well within operational parameters,” Control said. “Wormhole communications are also functional, but unable to test until launch for verification. However, wormhole internet connection is stable and available for immediate use.”

“The brig is solid, the cryo-pods are functioning properly for anybody that gets overzealous, and the spare rooms are furnished and secure,” Jessica added. “Plus, Connie and Sandra are looking great in those outfits.”

“Control and Sandra do both look good,” Jeremiah agreed, smiling. “And we have been given the thumbs up for launch as soon as our client arrives. Coincidentally, the other three Reaper Teams will be leaving at the same time, so they’re going to make a bit of a spectacle of it.”

“Nice,” Adam said. “Can’t wait to put this lady through her paces.”

“Now then, onto the second portion for missions,” Jeremiah said. “Names and callsigns.”

“I still vote for Connie for Control,” Jessica said, raising her hand.

“Too close to Control, in my opinion,” Adam argued. “How about Tilly?”

“That is just stupid,” Jessica shot back.

“What about Athena?” Quin asked. The Reapers all paused to look at her. “She was the one who directed all of our missions during the war, and what was Athena but a tactician and goddess of war?”

“Yeah, I like that,” Eric agreed. “Athena is a good name for her. And Talos, for that Greek golem.”

“Athena Talos, I could get behind that,” Jeremiah mused, turning it over in his mind. “But this is your name, Control, so what do you think?”

“I think Athena Talos is appropriate,” Control said with her robotic tone. “It pays tribute to my role in war, and my origins, while still removing me from the system and allowing my independence. I will take that name.”

“Nice, well, let us officially welcome you to the team then, Athena Talos,” Jeremiah said, and the Reapers all chimed in with their welcomes. “Now, callsigns?”

“Wyvern for Sandra,” Adam said immediately. “Since she’s Eric’s little lizard, and Eric is the Dragon, why not name her after a little dragon?”

“A wyvern is not a small dragon,” Eric protested.

“You, hush,” Jessica said. “We already know you are going to protest anything we come up with for Sandra, so your input is not valid.” Eric just grumbles a bit. “And what do ya know, flyboy, you do come up with good ideas on occasion. I second Wyvern. Keeps her associated with Eric specifically and her own self at the same time.”

“Sorry, Eric,” Quin said as Adam fist-bumps Jessica. “But I have to agree, Wyvern is a good one for her.” Eric just sighs as Sandra turns a yellow color, matching her sundress.

“Make that four for Wyvern,” Shao said. “It fits, and it’s something she can aspire to.”

“Unanimous for Wyvern then,” Jeremiah said. “The little lady has a lot of fight in her. Unless you have another suggestion, Athena?”

“Negative,” Athena said. “I was going to suggest Gecko or Anole due to her similarities to the reptiles, but you all make sound arguments.”

“Those would both be good too, but Wyvern is just badass,” Adam said. “Now, any suggestions for Athena’s callsign?” Everyone was quiet for a few moments as they thought. Sandra raised her hand.

“Ummmm, she’s good at getting information,” she said shyly, “and she kind of reminded me of those really smart black birds on Earth.”

“Are you talking about crows?” Quin asked as a few of the Reapers looked at each other. Sandra nodded her head.

“I wanted to see what Eric’s homeworld was like, and those kept on showing up as really intelligent,” Sandra said, her scales turning a slight orange in embarrassment.

“And in some stories, Crows and Ravens advent to the coming of the Reaper,” Jeremiah mused.

“That is dark,” Eric said, picking up Sandra and giving her a hug, “but in our case more than accurate. Good thinking, kiddo. I’m in favor of Crow.”

“She is much more elegant than that,” Jessica protested. “Raven is better.”

“Nah, Crow fits great,” Adam said cheekily. “She’s still a little choppy in interacting with people.”

“You’re just trying to piss me off again, aren’t you?” Jessica demanded.

“Maybe,” Adam said. “What if I am? Oh SHIT!” he exclaims as he gets tackled and immediately put into an armbar by Jessica. “Uncle, Uncle, goddamn woman, I need that to fly!”

“Sorry, Jessica, but Adam makes a good point,” Quin said, shaking her head.

“Traitor,” Jessica exclaims from the floor where she still hasn’t released Adam yet. “Us ladies gotta stick together!”

“Alright, any other suggestions?” Jeremiah asked. “If not, all in favor of Crow?” Five hands were raised, with Adam struggling to make sure his is seen. “Ok, all in favor of Raven?” Two hands from Jessica and Shao. “Crow it is. So, welcome to the team, Reaper Crow and Trainee Wyvern.” There’s a smattering of applause from the 8 people in the room before they hear a *Ding* overhead.

“Someone is requesting entrance to our vessel,” Athena said, her eyes unfocused as she accessed the ship systems. “It appears that Miss Redglow has arrived earlier than expected.”

“How long until the teams launch?” Jeremiah asks as Eric opens the door.

“Approximately 1 hour and 18 minutes,” Athena said.

“Good, gives us time to get her settled in then,” Eric said. “I’ll bring her in if you want to make sure the guest quarters are good to go?”

“Copy that,” Jeremiah said. “Shao, double check that the engines are good to go and begin preflight checks. Jessica, let go of Adam and let him start getting the ship warmed up.”

“Fine,” Jessica said, releasing Adam as Shao nodded and raced to the engines. Adam coughed a bit as he got up and rotated his arm and left for the cockpit.

“Athena, double check our launch time and make sure there aren’t any last-minute additions. Looks like ship names will have to wait for now, so we’ll just have to go by Delta for now.”

“Affirm,” Athena said. “However, what you said earlier gave me an idea for the ship.” Jeremiah paused and looked at Athena. “The Flying Dutchman, the ghost ship of the late 1600s.”

“Heh, a ghost ship full of Reapers?” Jessica said, smacking Athena’s back. “I like the way you think, girl. Seconded for Flying Dutchman!”

“Get me two more votes and we can take it,” Jeremiah said. Eric and Sandra immediately held up their hands. “*Flying Dutchman* it is,” Jeremiah conceded. “Not sure I like the message, but I’m sure we can change the image in the future."" He left to check the guest room while the rest dispersed, and Eric and Sandra headed towards the airlock.

He opened the airlock just as Shtaran was about to hit the call button again. “Hey, long time no see,” Eric said with a grin. Shtaran just stared at him.

“I thought the ship name sounded familiar,” she finally said, checking her datapad. “Corvette Delta?”

“Just renamed The Flying Dutchman not two minutes ago,” Eric said, stepping to the side. Sandra was waiting there as well, waving to Shtaran. Shtaran stared at her before squealing a bit.

“Oh. My. Goodness,” she said, dropping her bags. “You are just adorable in that dress.” Sandra turned a light orange in embarrassment but allowed Shtaran to give her a hug.

“I know, right?” Jessica said, walking up to them and sticking out a hand. “Jessica Archangel.”

“Shtaran Redglow,” Shtaran said, taking the hand. “I’m guessing you helped choose the outfit?”

“The girl needs to look good, and since her guardian is shit at fashion, I decided to step in with some help from Quin,” Jessica affirmed, picking up Shtaran’s bags. “Come on, I’ll show you to your room.”

“I can carry my own bags,” Shtaran protested, following the assertive woman.

“Yeah, but you’re our first customer, and a guest at that for a bit,” Jessica said. “Human customs demand we take your bags, your coat if you want, and make you meals while you’re here.”

“Also, a bit of a party later once we get to the point we can turn on the auto-pilot,” Jeremiah said, coming out of one of the guest quarters. “Jeremiah Burgess, at your service, ma’am,” he continued with a bit of a flourish and a bow. “Honored to have you on board, and we thank you for trusting us with your vacation travels.”

“Oh, uh, thank you for having me,” Shtaran said, clearly a bit flustered.

“Should have been called Fox instead of Wolf,” Eric muttered under his breath as Sandra giggled at the interaction.

Shtaran examined the room she was given, looking over the bed, couch, desk, and closet and dresser. “This place is almost nicer than my place,” she said, giving a slow spin to look around.

“Happy you like it,” Jeremiah said pleasantly. “Now a few safety rules. The doors are automatic, but in case of a power failure there is a manual release,” he said, pointing at a yellow arrow. “Additionally, we will not bother you in here unless you ask for us. The most we will do is knock on your door and ask if there is anything you need or to inform you of meals, which we can inform over the speakers if you would prefer. Now, in the event of a pirate boarding we do have mag-locks in an attempt to either slow or stop any boarding attempts. We ask that you either remain in your room, or if you are not already here, to make your way to the cockpit. Any questions so far?”

“No, sounds like standard stuff so far,” Shtaran said.

“Excellent. We still have a little over an hour before departure, would you like a tour of the ship before we leave?” Jeremiah asked. Jessica rolled her eyes at Eric as she left, and Eric nodded back in agreement.

…………………………………………………

“Alright crew, this is your flight captain speaking,” came the crackling on the ship wide speakers. “We are preparing for take-off, so if you could please make your way to the cockpit for an awesome show as to why I’m the best damn pilot here, that would be much appreciated.”

“Cheeky bastard,” Eric noted as he finished placing the roast into the oven. Somehow, he had been the one stuck on cooking detail for the night, which Eric complained about (“You make the best meals,” was the general consensus, “and tonight has got to be special for our first guest, first job, and the christening of our ship.”)

“Why did you put the food in the oven so early?” Sandra asked from the counter she was sitting at. “We won’t be eating it for a while from the sound of it.”

“It’s called slow cooking,” Eric said as he whipped his hands off on a rag and took his apron off. “You set the oven to a low temperature and cook it for a long period of time. Makes the meat juicier and tastier.”

“I don’t get it,” Sandra said, scrunching her face up. Eric just laughed.

“Come on, let’s go see what a ship launch from the inside looks like,” Eric said, holding out his hand. Sandra nodded, her dress flaring a bit as she hopped down and grabbed Eric’s hand.

All 9 people were there, with Adam in the main pilot seat, Jeremiah in a sub-pilot seat, and Athena sitting at a second sub-pilot seat, monitoring communications and planning their flight path to Addrius V.

“Engines are on and purring,” Adam said as the ship began to rumble. “Anti-gravity struts are activating, now. Landing struts are retracting.” There was a vibration as the *Flying Dutchman* disengaged its locks and the landing struts were retracted. “Systems are green. Athena, open a line to *Hope* command.”

“Opening line,” Athena said. There was a crackling sound as the speakers came online.

“This is *Hope* to all members of the crew, and to the new teams being released,” came the announcement. “Four new teams are being released today in an attempt to spread humans a bit further out. Teams, we wish you all luck, and Godspeed. May you turn the galaxy in your favor.”

“Corvette Alpha, taking off,” came another voice from the speakers.

“Corvette Bravo, heading out,” came a third.

“Corvette Delta, off to find some excitement.”

“Flying Dutchman, en route to our first job,” Adam said smugly. There was silence on the line for a moment before several people started talking at once.

“Wait, we can rename our ships?”

“I fucking told you we needed to get that name first!”

“You asshole!”

 “Catch up, gentlemen,” Adam said as Jessica laughed and Jeremiah just sighed. Shtaran just looked confused. “We get to break out the champaign first.”

“Is that Weasel? Of course it is, he’s the only damn person I know that’s that smug when it comes to flying.”

“Let me show you how it’s done,” Weasel said, grinning, a maniacal glint in his eye. Shtaran cautiously sat down on a chair, strapping herself in.

“This is Reaper Control to all Reaper units,” Athena said as the four corvettes began to leave the station. “Command would like to once again thank you for your service and would like to give you one final message before you depart. ‘Live your life as you wish and forgive us for using you as long as we did. Please, do not forget those that did not finish the war, and let us make the future a better one for the generations to come. This may sound like platitudes, but we at Reaper Command genuinely hope that you can continue to help humanity, and the galaxy as a whole, to usher in this new age.’” There was silence on the lines for a moment as everyone processed the meaning. The line was still open to *Hope* and any civilian lines at the right frequency as an open broadcast. They were going public now.

“Control, this is Reaper Mule,” came a call over the open line. “Please inform Reaper Command that those of us on Corvette Charlie, now renamed *Charon,* will always answer the call for help.”

“Reaper Spider of Bravo, now renamed *Wolfwind*. If Terra calls, we will answer. Deep space, frontier space, or the Bubble, if there is cause, we will be there. And if there are cries for help, or relief, or even just comfort from the galaxy at large, we will strive to alleviate them the best we can.”

“This is Reaper Pheonix of Alpha, now renamed *Frontiers Edge*. We didn’t stick around because of duty or obligation. We stuck around to protect our home. Well, our home has expanded quite a bit. We will protect it all the same.”

“This is Reaper Wolf of Delta, renamed the *Flying Dutchman*,” Jeremiah said, joining in. “I said it during the meeting and I’ll say it again. I doubt anybody outside of the Reapers could have stopped us if we had decided to leave. As long as my morals are not compromised, if Terra calls, we will answer. As long as there are children in danger and families at risk in the galaxy, we will take on the missions needed from us.”

“Command is greatly relieved to hear this, and has expressed their gratitude to all Reaper units,” Athena said. “Protect yourselves, protect the Galaxy, and above all, help everyone you can. Your gifts and abilities are too powerful to only help one group, so do not limit yourself to only the Terran Federation. Godspeed and Good Luck. Reaper Command, and Reaper Control, now redesignated as Reaper Crow, signing off.” The line closes as Adam rubs his hands together before taking the flight controls.

“Alright, let’s start this flight properly,” he said. Everybody that was still standing quickly found a seat and buckled in. As soon as the ship cleared the station, Adam gunned the engine. Even with the inertia dampening, Eric could feel himself pressing into the seat a bit as Adam circled the station, weaving in and out of a few struts before pointing towards the indicator for their route.

“Alright, activating FTL in 3, 2, 1, go,” Adam said. There was barely a perceptible change as the cockpit screen began to show a kaleidoscope of colors. “Well, that was fun. What’s for dinner?”

But what will distinguish real projects from low effort trash this time around?

**Proof Of Humanity**

https://preview.redd.it/0ebj86lpfkfg1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1591b01636cef1a856c2033b9601a02e9f22386

Some projects such as Kendu, have both social media and IRL efforts to prove that our social media output is indeed organic and that real people are behind this project.

The everyday person is using their creative skills to push Kendu forward whether it be energy drinks or coffee or murals, these can help bridge crypto and real life gathering a whole greater community of people.

Kendu has over 20 IRL efforts rn, all high quality and community led, personally I haven't seen anything remotely like Kendu and that is why I am all in.

We haven't abandoned the proven 2021 social media methods such as raiding and smashing posts, but we have expanded on this with IRL initiatives which is a key indicator of **Proof Of Humanity**

Nothing comes close both in terms of both IRL and social media efforts.

IRL wise we are absolutely unbeaten and we are in uncharted territory rn but in terms of social media we are still following the path laid by Pepe, Shib and other greats.

At Kendu we make success inevitable, with or without you

\- Heat and humidity, it feels like you’re breathing in hot soup for half of the year.

\- Liberal ideologies are not the most welcomed here, and I would prefer a place where there are like-minded people.

What I am looking for:

\- Obviously the two things mentioned beforehand, I would much prefer cold/gloomy and very liberal and creative.

\- Walkable/Car-optional, mostly for costs and I also enjoy public transit cities.

\- Music scene (possibly the biggest one) I am a huge fan of everything artsy and experimental and in Georgia you can’t really just find people walking around listening to elliott smith, velvet underground, joy division, xiu xiu etc.

\- Easy to find friends with similar interests, specifically arthouse film like David Lynch and Harmony Korine, weirdo music folks into the artists mentioned earlier + other stuff like dean blunt, ariel pink (not a place with his politics though), and local bands that still record onto cassette and aren’t afraid to get crazy.

\- A city where I don’t feel stranded in a huge skyline urban wasteland, this isn’t a huge requirement but i much prefer cities that still have trees on the sidewalks, simple coffee shops, quaint record shops, while still having a population large enough to find people to indulge in my niche interests with.

I know that there aren’t many places that fit all of this criteria + be suitable for a 19 year old that will only be working a part time job due to college, but I would like to know the cities that fit these the closest. A big one I have been thinking about is Portland, Oregon and I really feel like it could be a great place for me, but I don’t want to over romanticize and I would like a second opinion.

We live on a well and while I usually filter it for drinking or the espresso maker, I think we ended up using water from the “tap” to do the descaling. Anyway, I wasn’t able to use it after cleaning and finally had time today and pulled out the water tank to see this monstrosity. I have no idea if the descaling packet caused it (over a year old) or my water and I’m now worried the whole machine is contaminated.

I said no, because I needed to rest before my night shift at the hospital, and I could have coffee with my father at home.She left me at the door and was gone for about five hours. When she returned, she blamed me entirely. It felt like a stab in the heart she said. We argued very strongly.
At one point, I asked her if she wanted a divorce. She told me to do whatever I wanted and said I would never get an answer about that from her mouth. I left and went to work, feeling hurt and conflicted.

1qmwfss,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1qmwfss/wyatt_soul_snatchers_pre_sabraska_knitting/,"Wyatt, Soul Snatcher’s , pre Sabraska Knitting","He had spent the better part of the night turning them over in his hands, feeling the faint warmth of the grips, testing the smooth draw from the holsters Milkades had included in the case. No dramatic glow, no energy hum—just quiet lethality tuned to intent. They were smaller than the standard Royal Marine sidearms, easier to conceal under his armorweave, perfect for a man who wasn’t officially a Marine but who kept finding himself in places where weapons mattered.

Wyatt exhaled slowly. The ship was quiet this early—only the low thrum of the stealth drives and the occasional distant clank from engineering. He stood, pulled on the black armorweave suit, and methodically attached the holsters to the magnetic thigh mounts. The pistols slid home with soft clicks. A quick glance in the small mirror bolted to the bulkhead: the guns sat low and flat, barely breaking the clean lines of the suit. Presentable. Ready.

Before stepping out, he activated the neural link. The implant behind his right ear gave the familiar faint buzz, then connected.

Cynthia.

Her response came almost instantly, warm and alert despite the hour.

Wyatt. You’re up early.

Milkades gifted me two soul snatchers last night. Sealed case, Royal Marine pattern but scaled down.

A brief pause—Wyatt could almost picture her smirking.

We approved them, she sent back. Clara and I both signed off. They’re yours.

Wyatt felt a small knot of tension loosen in his chest. Good to know. Heading to the mess hall in a minute.

Change of plan. Come to Clara’s quarters first. We have breakfast ready.

He raised an eyebrow at the empty room. Breakfast?

Eggs, bacon, sliced avocados, some pastries that almost taste real. And put the soul snatchers on before you come. Let’s see how they look on you.

Wyatt glanced down at the already-mounted holsters and gave a quiet chuckle that didn’t transmit.

Already wearing them.

Perfect. Hurry up then. Clara’s insisting on grape juice this morning—she synthesized a fresh batch. Says it’s better than the orange everyone keeps pushing.

On my way.

The link closed with a soft mental click.

Wyatt stepped into the corridor. The Nori Navio was still waking—only a handful of crew moving between shifts. A pair of Auxilia techs nodded as he passed; one glanced at the new holsters but said nothing. The ship had no markings, no flags, no compromise. Stealth was doctrine. Armed crew outside the Marines drew looks, but after the capture—after Wyatt had rammed a garbage hauler into the Black Ship’s hull and helped Cynthia’s squad take the bridge—most people had stopped questioning his place.

He passed logistics. The corridor lights were still dim here, night-cycle blue. Sabraska wasn’t on shift yet, her usual post didn’t start for another hour , but the memory of yesterday’s hallway conversation lingered. Her easy laugh, the way she’d leaned against the bulkhead, green eyes bright. Wyatt shook his head. Just crew talk. Friendly. Nothing more.

Clara’s quarters were near the forward spine, larger than standard, originally an officer’s suite from whatever mysterious origin the Black Ship had before it became the Nori Navio. The door slid open at his approach, no chime, no announcement. Clara liked it quiet. The two Royal Marines giving him a nod of approval as he had approached. 

Inside, the air smelled of real food: sizzling bacon, fresh coffee analog, something buttery and sweet. Soft lighting, a low table set for three . Cynthia sat cross-legged as normal on a cushion, Eastern bluebird  hair pulled into a loose ponytail , reviewing a holographic tactical overlay that floated above her plate. Clara , a pastry in one hand a glass of juice in the other ,  Milkades stood near the back, half in shadow, his cloaked form flickering faintly like heat haze.

Clara looked up first, eyes flicking immediately to the holsters.

“Wyatt,” she said, smiling. “Come in. Sit.”

Cynthia standing , circling him slowly like she was inspecting new kit.

“Turn,” she ordered.

Wyatt raised both hands in mock surrender and did a slow pivot. The soul snatchers stayed low and flat against his thighs—no printing, no awkward bulk.

Cynthia gave a low whistle. “Clean. Low profile. Milkades knows his craft.”

“Perfect fit,” Milkades intoned from the corner, voice layered and soft.

Clara gestured to the empty place at the table. “Sit. Eat before it gets cold. We have eggs—real protein base, not synth—bacon crisped just right, avocados from the last hydroponic harvest, and pastries I bribed the galley chief for. Oh, and—” she reached over and lifted a clear pitcher filled with deep purple liquid, “ grape juice. Freshly pressed. No pulp. I won the argument with the food synthesizer this morning.”

Wyatt took his seat, unable to keep from smiling. “Grape juice. Fancy.”

“After the week we’ve had,” Clara said, pouring him a glass, “we deserve fancy.”

Cynthia dropped to the cushions beside him, already reaching for bacon. “So. How do they feel?”

Wyatt drew one pistol smoothly—slow, so no one startled, then returned it to the holster. “Light. Balanced. Grips warm up almost immediately. Like they’re syncing.”

“They are,” Milkades said. “They read through your neural pattern. The more focused the threat, the cleaner the discharge. Non-lethal disruption is not possible even  if you will it.”

Clara sipped her juice. “We didn’t gift them lightly. You’re not just a pilot anymore, Wyatt. Not after the capture. Not after every boarding action since. You’re in the circle. That means you carry what we carry.”

Cynthia leaned forward, elbows on the table. “Both yes and no, remember? Yes when you’re with us. Yes when the ship’s threatened. No when you’re off-duty in the lounge pretending you don’t notice women staring.”

Wyatt nearly choked on his first bite of egg. “What?”

Clara laughed—bright, genuine. “Oh come on. The corridor cam caught  two women in the mess hall yesterday. One  touched your arm three times. Three. That’s not casual Wyatt .”

“I thought she was just being friendly,” Wyatt muttered, face warming.

Cynthia snorted. “Friendly like a targeting laser is friendly.”

Milkades tilted his head. “Human courtship signals are inefficient but persistent.”

Wyatt groaned, rubbing his face. “Can we go back to talking about the guns?”

Clara grinned, mercifully changing the subject. “Fine. 

Wyatt didn’t answer—just took a long drink of grape juice. It was tart, sweet, impossibly real. For a moment the war, the stealth runs, Draymor’s coup, the endless black outside—all of it receded.

Breakfast stretched on. 

Wyatt listened, ate, felt the soul snatchers’ quiet weight against his legs. They weren’t just guns. They were trust. Clara’s trust. Cynthia’s trust. The ship’s trust.

When the plates were mostly empty, Clara leaned back. “Wyatt?”

“Yeah?”

“Keep them on. Unless Cynthia says they are not needed . 

He met her eyes. Nodded once.

“Understood.”

Cynthia stood, stretching. “Right. I’ve got sword drills. Wyatt—you’re on combat hand to hand later. Don’t be late.”

“Wouldn’t dream of it.”

The pitcher was still half full.

He poured another glass, raised it toward the two friends “ I have friends “  room in silent toast.

To new weapons. To new  friends. To whatever waited in the black.

Then he headed out, soul snatchers riding low and steady, the Nori Navio humming around him like a living thing.

Back in Clara’s quarters, the door had barely hissed shut behind Wyatt when Clara swiped her hand through the air. A holographic security feed bloomed to life above the low table—multiple corridor views stitched together in real time. Wyatt’s figure appeared, striding confidently down the main spine, the new holsters catching faint glints from the amber strips.

Cynthia dropped back into her seat with a grin, leaning forward. “Let’s see how the crew reacts to the new look.”

Clara zoomed in slightly as Wyatt passed a knot of Auxilia techs. One nudged another, nodding toward the pistols; the second gave a subtle thumbs-up. Another group of off-duty Marines paused their conversation, eyes flicking to his thighs before offering respectful nods.

“See?” Cynthia said, smirking. “They approve. He’s one of us now.”

Clara chuckled softly. “He’s always been. Just took the guns to make it official.”

The feed switched angles as Wyatt approached the logistics section.  Sabraska Caspars stood at her workstation, datapad in hand—until she spotted him through the transparent wall. Her posture shifted instantly: shoulders relaxing, a small smile blooming as she raised a hand and motioned him in with two fingers.

Clara zoomed closer. “There she is. Look at that face.”

Cynthia leaned in, eyes sparkling. “She lit up like a targeting array. And Clara look there’s the arm touch.”

On the feed, Sabraska stepped close to Wyatt, her fingers brushing the edge of one holster before sliding up to rest on his upper arm. She lingered, thumb pressing lightly. Then again, trailing down his forearm as she guided him to the holo-screen. Another quick graze across his wrist as he turned to leave.

Cynthia let out a delighted squeak. “Three touches. Minimum. She’s not even trying to hide it anymore.”

Clara covered her mouth to stifle a laugh. “Look at Wyatt. Completely oblivious. He’s got that polite nod going, but his brain’s probably still on shield emitters.”

“Men are so dumb with women,” Cynthia said, shaking her head fondly. “He’s got no idea she’s been orbiting him for weeks.”

Clara’s expression softened into something warmer, almost conspiratorial. “I bet he doesn’t even know it. Poor guy’s been too busy flying and fighting to notice the signals.”

They watched as Wyatt exited the office, pausing for a split second in the main bay to check his reflection in a polished locker. His posture straightened just a fraction, like the touches had left an invisible mark.

Cynthia grinned wider. “He’s rattled. In a good way. Look at him shake his head—like he’s trying to convince himself it’s just ‘friendly.’”

Clara dismissed the feed with a wave, but her eyes lingered on the blank space where it had been. “Keep an eye on those two, Cynthia. When they’re in meetings, during briefings, in the lounge—whatever. If this turns into something, I want to make sure it doesn’t blindside us. Or him.”

Cynthia nodded, serious now. “Will do. But honestly? I think it’s good for him. He deserves someone who sees him the way we do.”

Clara poured the last of the grape juice into her glass, raising it in a quiet toast. “To Wyatt figuring it out—eventually. And to Sabraska for having the patience of a saint.”

They clinked glasses softly, the sound lost in the hum of the ship.

Meanwhile, Wyatt moved on toward the hangar, the ghost of Sabraska’s touches still tingling on his arm. The Nori Navio sailed on through the black, unmarked and silent, while somewhere in the back of his mind a small, stubborn voice started to wonder if maybe—just maybe—there was more to Sabraska Caspars’ smiles than crew courtesy.

From the get go, this guy was really (too much imo) involved. My manager and mentor are overseas, but this guy is in the office so he volunteered as the unofficial person to show me around.

The thing is, there have been many instances where i believe he acts as if he was my manager, where he asks inappropiate questions that he simply doesnt need to know the answer to (if it helps, he used to be a manager right before this job).

For example. On the day of the anual company party, i had to come really late to the presentation part, and the places to this were limited (even tho there were clearly places left in the venue). The next day he texts me asking why i didnt come, saying that i could have given my spot to his friend. This put me in an uncomfortable place, cos i could have had a personal issue, yet he expects me to answer him.

On the first couple of days at the job, i skipped going to the office on one of the days they come bc i forgot i had an appointment, and didnt say anything (i just didnt know tbh). Again, he asked my i didnt come and started giving me a lecture

I have been having pain on my shoulder when i WFH because i have a shitty plastic chair that is too low, and a desk too high. Then i asked in our work groupchat if the company can provide us with an ergonomic chair. He went on some argument for the company, basically saying that thats why they pay me and that i can buy it myself. One day in person, he made another snarky comment, making fun of it, in front of all the others. Thankfully it went mostly unnoticed

Another day i asked if the company can pay for the taxi back home after the company party, since i live really far away and it might end once public transport is finished. Again, he starts making fun of me for asking for that (but staying professional)

Im really sick of this guy, he's a workaholic and expects us to be the same as him. I am 99% sure he does this with me because im a woman, because he is more experienced than me so he is in a psoition of power, but also because i am less conforming than the other colleagues, as i act a bit like i want and do less of the pretending. Also, i recently was called in one of the director's office because supposedly i am not integrating well (translation, i come one hour later to avoid the useless 1h coffee break, and to sleep more; we have no set schedule btw). I am 99% sure this guy is the one that instigated this and mentioned it to the director, since the others dont really give a shit.

I am not the smartest worker, i quickly lose my patience and react quickly. I have never complained about him yet, but at least i realized that instead of going to the director or my manager, i should first send him a stern message if he ever pulls this shit again

How should i deal with him? Do you think he is right to act like this, or is he going overboard? My coworker that has become my close friend absolutely hates him too

Edit: to add more context, i am located in Europe. We have our own HR in the office and everything. I think in the US people quickly/easily escalate to HR, but here it is probably seen badly to do that quickyl, and best to stay away from creating drama, unless its really necessary...",3,1769377282.0,work,7,0.8,False

The place wasn't exactly the Ritz, but it functioned. The wallpaper popped and flaked when you scraped a nail along it, and peeled away at the corner behind the TV. The bathroom taps sputtered feebly as I stood shivering on December mornings, waiting to wash my face. I battled the condensation that hung on the inside of our bedroom window, dreading the mould that would follow.

John and I didn't speak of our diminished circumstances. He'd taken a job at a distribution warehouse, and they were working him like a dog. He was too stressed, too focused on working every hour God sent, and I was too afraid of breaking the relative peace.

I spent my days holed up in the small flat watching daytime TV, skin crawling at the accumulating dust.

The case officer's voice echoed in my head:

\*Can you bend over to pick up a pen from the floor? Can you do it now so I can see?\*

Shame prickled up my neck. I pushed myself up slowly from the sofa, catching myself on the coffee table as I rose.

I walked into the kitchen to get away from the thoughts, grimacing at the sickly smell leaching up from the butcher's below. Coffee would help.

I flicked the kettle on and leaned back against the counter, shins burning.

It hadn't always been like this. My mind reeled backwards before I could stop it. Back to when we could still pay the mortgage on our three-bed semi. Back when my body still worked, and John could still look me in the face.

A tear burned my eye, and I wiped it away angrily. The wet blur caught a glimmer of light; something shone up at me from the floor. I knelt, knees cracking. It was a clear, viscous film. I touched it hesitantly. Thin, mucosal strands stretched between my fingers. It smelled strongly of petrol.

I wiped my hand on my trousers, confused, and grabbed the damp cloth that lay on the scratched worktop. I wiped away the unknown residue and threw the rag into the sink.

I returned to the sofa and turned the TV up, trying to push the pain out of focus. Bailiffs were executing a writ of possession on an irate shopkeeper. I watched as he attempted to lock the shutters and trap them inside. My mind flitted back to the probing questions of the case officer:

\*If you spilled something...Could you kneel?...Can you clean up after yourself?... Show me.\*

The bailiff called the police. The shopkeeper spat and swore. The shutters rattled closed. I'd worked my whole adult life. I'd always paid my taxes, never claimed anything. And here I was, begging and cringing for my pittance.

I heard heavy footsteps climbing the metal stairs outside. John was home. He brought an eddy of cold wind inside with him and shut the door without saying anything. I pressed my tongue to the back of my teeth.

""Hey, babe."" I called to the hallway. I got no response. I heard the heavy thud of one boot pulled off, then the other. The footsteps receded into the bathroom.

I turned my eyes back to the TV, chest heavy. The shopkeeper was calling his cousin to come and beat up the bailiff. His vicious words were censored out with a long, shrill bleep.

\*\*\*\*

John and I sat on the sofa, microwave meals on our laps. I twisted a fork through the yellow slop that was supposed to be carbonara, eyeing the pink flecks of meat.

John sighed. I looked over at him, longing to touch him.

""How was your day?""

He shrugged. ""Same as always.""

He didn't look at me, and I didn't press him. Fatigue was etched onto his face. I looked at the grey hunk of lasagne on his tray. A rainbow of oil glinted at me from the edge of the plate. My brow furrowed as I watched him lift his fork. A thin tendril clung to it and stretched upwards towards his mouth.

""John?""

He looked back at me, irritated. ""What?""

""Nothing."" I didn't want to bother him. The food was barely edible anyway, I didn't need to put him off.

He looked back at the TV and we sat in silence. The shopkeeper spat venom at the police officer, and was shoved head first into the car.

\*\*\*\*

I took a deep breath and stood up from my stool by the kitchen sink. I plunged my hands back into the tepid dishwater and resumed washing. I lifted out a plate, disturbing a prism of colour on the water's surface.

I stopped, watching the colours ripple as the water settled. I looked at the plate again; smeared across it was the same oily film. I scrunched my nose at the petrol smell.

I turned on the tap, trying to rinse it away, but it clung there insistently.

I scrubbed. The pain in my wrists flared. When I finally set the clean plate on the rack, my fingers felt tacky, as though I’d dipped them in glue. I squirted 4 pumps from the soap dispenser and rubbed my hands together frantically in the hot water until they turned red.

\*\*\*\*

The next morning, I sat in my usual place on the sofa, watching passively as a toothless woman screamed obscenities at her philandering husband. The host gleefully sat between them on the stage, scorning the man for his disloyalty. A huge security guard held the man's jacket as he grew red in the face, desperately trying to throw a punch at the presenter.

My mind kept going back to the kitchen, agitating over the stain. \*Had I gotten all of it? What even was it? A chemical? Something soaking up from the butcher's?\* I switched off the TV just as the woman's sister bypassed the security guard and launched herself at the man, scratching his face.

My ears rang in the silence.

\*Could you mop the floor on a bad day?\*

I stood up and walked into the kitchen, bare feet careful on the cold tiles.

\*\*\*\*

It was back.

The puddle sat in the same place as before, just to the left of our rickety table. The light from the window caught it and reflected back a familiar oily rainbow. It didn't move, or change, it just waited. The smell of gasoline hit me again, but this time something lay underneath, sweeter, cloying. Animal.

\*\*\*\*

I hovered awkwardly in front of the butcher's counter, waiting for him to appear from behind the metal curtain. I shifted my weight from side to side to ease the ache in my shins.The smell was stronger down here, and I tucked my chin down into my hood to escape it. I had only met the butcher twice, and I would rather have kept it that way. He was fat and balding, but carried himself with unearned confidence. His lecherous smirks put me on edge; I had tried my best to avoid him, until now.

A fly buzzed around a hanging slab of meat, and I watched it with revolted fascination. The curtain jangled. I looked round to see the butcher stride into view.

""Well, hello again beautiful. I was wondering when you'd come and say hello. Did you miss me?""

""Um... no, I needed to ask you about something.""

""You didn't miss me? You're breaking my heart love. Why don't you give me a smile eh?""

""Look, I think some of your chemicals are soaking through into our flat. I keep finding this... stain in the kitchen.""

""You going to invite me in eh? We could have some fun you know. I won't tell that bloke of yours.""

""For Christ's sake, listen to me!"" I shouted. ""Whatever you're using down here, it's leaching upstairs. I need you to check if there's a... hole or a... a crack or something that's letting it through.""

His face grew cold. The empty stupidity behind his eyes vanished, and was replaced with rage. I saw then that he was not just a pest but a dangerous man. I stepped backwards.

""There's no need to be rude. Fucking bitch. I'd be doing you a favour you know. Fat bitch like you.""

""I'm sorry, I uh...""

He leaned closer. An animal stink rose off his body. Sweat, and blood.

""You come down 'ere, accusing me, and now you're sorry?""

""Please... I'm not accusing you. I'm just worried about the chemicals-""

""What chemicals? I don't use no chemicals. You think I can't run my own shop?""

""No...no. I just thought maybe... something in the pipes...""

""You're a mental bitch, aren't you?""

I cringed, backing away. He slammed his hand down on the counter. I flinched and recoiled. I turned on my heels and ran back up the stairs.

""Fuck off then you stupid slut! Tell your bloke I said hello!"" He shouted after me, barking laughter.

\*\*\*\*

My teeth ground against each other as I worked, sweat dripping from my forehead onto the soapy tiles. The hard bristles scraped forward, dragged back, as my shoulders burned with the effort.

The stain seemed thicker now, more resistant. The brush kept catching against the floor, the oily residue gathering behind it. I fought against it bitterly, scalding my hands in the rinsewater. The smell of bleach and gasoline made my head swim, until finally the floor was clean. I leaned back on the counter, breathless and exhausted.

I heard the familiar heavy boots pounding up the stairs. I looked around guiltily. John appeared in the door frame and looked down at me, irritation on his face.

""What the fuck are you doing?""

""I uh, I was just cleaning the floor. There was a...stain that has been bothering me.""

""You're going to make yourself ill. I can't take time off to look after you.""

""I know, I know, I'll be fine. I just... had a bit more energy today.""

""You know what the doctor said. The last thing I need is you going downhill again.""

""I'm sorry, John."" My hands shook as I looked away from his disappointed face.

He sighed angrily and stomped away. His footsteps disappeared into the bedroom, and the door slammed.

I sat there, sweaty and ashamed, and looked back at the floor. It gleamed innocently as I stood up and turned off the light, shutting the door behind me.

\*\*\*\*

I was seated at a table, endless darkness surrounding me. In front of me lay a vast chessboard. My opponent sat opposite, clipboard obscuring their face. I couldn't remember sitting down, couldn't remember the game starting. I looked at my pieces; I had lost all but 3.

""What's happening?"" I asked, confused.

""Are you able to wash independently?"" A deep, flat voice asked.

""Wh...what? Yes... I can wash...""

My pawn moved forward. A black knight claimed it.

""Are you depressed?"" My bishop slid diagonally. A castle knocked it off the board.

""I'm not depressed, I just.... I'm just unwell. I can't...""

""Are you a burden to your friends and family? Is there anyone left, you stupid slut?""

Checkmate.

\*\*\*\*

I awoke with a jolt, cold sweat on my face. I gasped for breath as the room swam back into focus. I breathed a deep, shuddering sigh. I lay there for a moment, trying to calm my racing heart. I decided a cup of tea would be the best thing. I threw back the covers and went to sit up... and couldn't. Panic rose again through my body as I looked around wildly. I strained hard and pulled my leg up from the mattress. A long, thick tendril stretched away from it like toffee. I screamed.

\*\*\*\*

I awoke with a start as a bus went rattling by the window, and turned over to see John looking back at me, smiling softly.

""Morning, babe. How are you feeling?""

I scanned my body; my shoulders throbbed horribly. I tried to recall the nightmare, but it slipped away from me like sand clenched in a fist. My mind snapped back to my pain; I would pay today for my efforts.

""I'm fine. Long shift today?""

""I should be home around 6."" He leaned closer, worry in his eyes, and gently kissed my lips. ""Get some rest today, don't push yourself again. I'll bring home dinner.""

""I promise."" I said, smiling back at him. My fingers curled under the sheet.

\*\*\*\*

The door shut behind John, and I lay there in the silence, my promise hanging in the air. I stared at the ceiling for a long time, focusing on a cobweb in the corner. A spider spun its prey endlessly around and around between its legs.

I pushed up from the bed with a grunt. John had left me a coffee on the bedside table, and I drank it gratefully, savouring the warmth that spread through my aching chest. I shuffled into the living room and flicked on the TV, volume low.

A crime scene cleanup show was on; a grim intervention with masked men in hazmat suits. I sipped my coffee as they worked through a filthy, cluttered kitchen, shovelling heaps of mouldy paper and rotting food into black bags.

In the centre of the floor lay a deep, purple stain, blooming wide on the filthy linoleum. The edges looked iridescent under the light of the camera, like petrol on wet tarmac.

One of the men took a utility knife and began to slice open the linoleum, pulling back strips of sodden underlay and revealing the rotting floorboards underneath. As he pressed down to lever a section free, his gloved hand stuck. I watched as he tugged, and a long, viscous strand stretched between the glove and the floor. He yanked upwards and it snapped with a wet smack.

My stomach lurched. I fumbled the remote and the TV clicked off. My pale face stared back from the black screen, eyes wide.

\*Do you find yourself fixating on small things more than you used to, like household messes for example?\*

I had to go and see.

\*\*\*\*

I waited in the hallway, breath shallow in my chest. I willed myself to turn the handle, scolded myself for being so childish. Of course there would be nothing there, the floor was immaculate. I was just stressed, just imagining things. My hand shook as I turned the handle.

\*\*\*\*

I stood in the doorway as unreality washed over me.

The kitchen was unrecognisable. The substance had spread almost wall to wall. Writhing tendrils were climbing up the table legs and counters. Smaller patches had seeded on the walls and the fridge. The smell burned my eyes; the heady petrol had mixed with the stench of rotting meat, amplified to a choking crescendo. My knees buckled. I grabbed the door frame, desperately trying to hold myself up.

I watched as a twisting arm snaked up the fridge, slithering up to the handle and nudging the door ajar. The cold white light shone on the remains of a roast chicken, slowly liquefying under a blanket of sludge. Nausea came over me in waves. A bubble grew and popped, hissing.

The once clear film had turned a deep, bruised purple, and thin rivulets were sprawling outwards like veins. I clapped a hand over my mouth. A tendril that had been creeping unseen towards my feet reared back at the sound. I slammed the door.

\*\*\*\*

""John, please, I need you. Please, just come home.""

""Can't you just tell me what's wrong? I really can't leave, they'll take away my overtime. We'll be fucked.""

""Please John, I wouldn't ask if it wasn't an emergency. Please just come home.""

He sighed angrily. ""Fuck's sake. OK, I'll be there in 20.""

I hung up the phone and paced back and forth on the balcony, fighting down the hysterics. I tried desperately to cling onto rationality. To make sense of this. But there was no understanding it. I sat on the bottom step, curling my arms around myself, and stared hard at the ground.

John arrived 10 minutes later, and shoved open the gate with irritation. His face broke as he caught sight of me, and he rushed to my side.

""Babe? What's wrong? What's happened?""

""John... I... I can't...""

""It's OK,"" he said soothingly. ""Just tell me what's going on.""

""The kitchen... the floor...""

""What is it?""

I just looked at him weakly. I couldn't say it. I gestured back towards the door.

""Stay here.""

Heavy boots thudded up the stairs behind me. I waited for the scream. Nothing came.

""John?"" I looked round. I couldn't see him.

Panic shot through me. \*It must have swallowed him. I sent him in there with no warning and it got him.\*

I raced up the stairs and flung open the kitchen door, and saw John, standing in the centre of the room looking confused. The substance lay underneath his feet, flat and yielding.

""Babe? There's nothing here."" He said, using the same quiet voice he used when I had my flare-ups.

I stared at him. At the stinking purple mess pulsing beneath his feet. At the sprawling veins still climbing the walls, now reaching the ceiling. ""John... it's everywhere.""

He sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose. ""Maybe you should lie down. I'll get you some water.""

""John, please-"" I took one step towards him, and a writhing tendril wrapped quickly around my ankle. It burned, searing pain shooting up my leg. I gasped and fell forward, landing on my knees directly onto the substance.

It gave like thick gravy. More vines shot upwards, twisting around my wrists and ripping them downwards. I gasped in horror and pain. A deep, wet sucking sound rose from below. It pulled me down. The stench was maddening. I stared at John for help, but he just stood there, brow furrowed, looking at me.

""I'll call the GP in the morning. You're obviously hallucinating. The stress, the pain, it's all too much.""

""John!"" I screamed helplessly as the hungry liquid compressed my abdomen, lurching upwards. The burning agony made it impossible to think. It squeezed the air from my lungs. I went limp, giving in.

John was already turning away. ""I'll speak to my boss. I've got some holiday saved... it will be OK... I'll try and get home early tonight.""

The last thing I heard was the front door clicking and John's heavy boots on the stairs.

Gerald Hawthorne, once a loyal employee to his company transitioned into a deranged psychopath. He wore their mascot costume to commit murders not only at night but also during broad daylight. Often picking on unsuspecting customers and staffs (adults) with very quick and sly tactics to keep him out of sight. No matter how big his victim was, he got the job done. Remaining staffs took notice of said murders and pinned point Gerald Hawthorne responsible for his crimes. Out of pure resentment and hatred, he ran to a safe room only accessible to him to daunt the suit one last time to fight off his ex-coworkers. He overpowered them with ease, thinking he'd won. Suddenly, an almost beaten up staff from behind Gerald yelled his name, catching his attention and with full force, splashed a glass of their left over coffee onto the suit, specifically the mask's surface, disrupting the circuitry of the mascot's facial area. This caused the suit to fry the user inside, eventually going up in flames, killing the psychopath. The remaining survivors and staffs dragged him down into a storage room, deep down, where life was almost non existent. 17 years later, the vengeful spirit inhabits its former vessel, along with its mascot shell, and vows to inflict as much terror and pain to those who did him wrong for eternity.",5,1769377141.0,pillarchase2,1,1.0,False

Geriatric Millennial here!

Sorry to crash your sub, but I'd like to ask for your insight. I've think Ive noticed a trend, both on reddit and with Gen Zers I know ​irl, and I'd appreciate it being explained or debunked...

I've noticed a trend of young adults being concerned about having their choices and behaviors judged by others and asking for other people's... opinions? permission?

Examples:

\* If I go to a bar/coffee shop/restaurant/movie alone, is that weird?

\* Is it embarrassing if I buy myself a birthday cake?

  
\* (After asking about their weekend) I just hung out played video games all weekend, is that weird?

  
\* I live with my parents/have an older car/use the bus (looks embarrassed)

I'm not here to judge; I want to understand. If anything, it makes me feel sad for them. I'd like to figure out how I can be supportive.

Do you think this an actual pattern? If so, what do you think I'd the cause?

It seems ever since my father moved houses, he has been working a lot.

 He hasn't got time to watch TV, brush his hair out and eat. I didn't notice this when I was little but as I grow older, I notice he's been avoiding meals a lot.

This went on for about 4-5 years until in 2025, he was hospitalised. He was discharged within a week and told to eat healthy. He has been trying since. 

But, some days I will ask him what he ate and he will say ""Just coffee."". That's always the answer.

Today, he told me he just drank juice for breakfast and didn't eat at all because he 'forgot' his lunch. Last week, we were talking about favorite foods and he told me he loves rice but he can't eat it because once he does, he can't seem to stop.

He recognises this is an unhealthy pattern but it's pretty hard for him to break it. Any advice?",1,1769377035.0,EatingDisorders,1,1.0,False
1qmw8tc,https://i.redd.it/86win765ekfg1.jpeg,How does my dog detect PEM?,"My four year old Cockapoo, Bailey, understands when I am going to crash. That sounds over the top, but I have had my suspicions for some time and then he seemed to confirm them at the weekend. 

I had been slightly overdoing it for the previous week; not sleeping every afternoon, going for a couple of dog walks and generally feeling a little better than normal. 

By Friday I knew I had done too much, but felt ok. No symptoms and if anything I felt quite positive. Woke up Saturday morning and I felt fine (when I say fine I mean mild ME fine, not normal fine), but Bailey would not leave me alone. He stayed with me every single minute and when my wife and I decided to go out for a coffee Saturday afternoon he got really stressed and tried to block the door. It reached the point that he grabbed the bottom of my trousers with his teeth. He has never been aggressive or forceful before and this was highly unusual behaviour. 

We only went out for 15 minutes and boom! I got very light headed and could not stand up. Buzzing in my head and all of the other symptoms came in. 

Managed to get home (my wife drives these days) and I led on the sofa. He has not left me alone since and is totally ignoring my wife. He normally loves her, but it’s like he is blaming her for taking me out. 

He has got much closer to me on days from early morning and I have then had a crash later on, but this one seemed more obvious. 

I wonder what he physically senses in me?

1qmw84r,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1qmw84r/im_at_a_loss/,I’m at a loss,"This is a throwaway account because my other username is what I use for everything, don’t want people to find me. Especially not my bf, who has Reddit.

I (23 f) washed my boyfriend’s (34 m) blanket because he spilled coffee on it, so I went ahead and put some towels and sheets in. I started the dishwasher, I left him alone while he napped. He works 5-6 days a week, outside sometimes, and it’s hard labor.

He woke up, I put on his football game that he was excited to watch, I got his blanket out of the dryer for him, and I put the bedsheets on by myself (we usually do it together) so he could relax. I ask him for a kiss, he won’t give it to me. He’s just covers his mouth up, or offers his forehead. I tell him on the lips, he just looks at me. I say on your face accidentally because I just want one, he laughs and offers his forehead again. He then plugs his nose and “pretends that I smell”. He said not really immediately, but I am now sweaty from all of that so I’m sure I do to a degree.

Finally get a kiss, go about my life. A little bit later he starts telling me I don’t love him (as a joke. We sometimes say it to each other as a joke, but it’s normally after long silence or maybe once after the other does something) but this time I was aggravated because he KEPT saying it after I just did all those things for him, and purposely made it so that he wouldn’t have to lift a finger cause today’s his day off. And he said “I’m gonna go to my dads tonight” and I said why and he said “because you don’t love me” that’s a huge no no for him. He ex was very abusive and he got kicked out a lot and had to take refuge at his dads, so him telling me that just reminded me of that and it made me more annoyed.

And so I said “I don’t love you because I did the dishes?”

“nope”

“ I don’t love you because I washed your blanket?” “Nope”

“I don’t love you because I made the bed without you having to help and turned on your game?” “Nope”

so I got frustrated because I don’t care if he says it once or twice, but being adamant about it with no thank you, joking or not, hurts my feelings. So then I tell him I have to go to the bathroom and he tells me I’m mean and texts me this: “you didn’t kiss me.” Then before I reply he says “you’re being mean and I’m just playing”. I about lost my shit because HES THE ONE who wouldn’t kiss me twenty minutes ago.   And he does it all the time because he thinks he’s being funny. I ask for a kiss or a hug and I have to practically beg him and wait for five minutes before he finally gives it to me. So I send “no, you’re the one being mean” and he just sends a thumbs up. And now I’m supposed to read his mind and know he wanted a kiss, AFTER I HAD TO DRAG ONE OUT OF HIM FOR FIVE MINUTES AFTER DOING ALL THAT SHIT.

So I sent this “I did all those things and instead of telling me thank you, you just accuse me of not loving you. The icing on the cake is you telling me I didn’t kiss you, after I was practically begging you to kiss me for like five minutes and you had to say was that I “stank”. And he didn’t respond.

I come out and confront him. I don’t remember everything we said now, but I basically called him out on it, and he just kept getting more angry saying he was joking. He said he wasn’t pissed off then but he was now. By the way, I’m keeping my voice calm and pretty much quiet, and he’s telling. That’s how pretty much all our arguments go. He told me to just watch whatever cause he didn’t wanna watch the game, and I insisted and said “you said you were excited for it, so just watch it” and he said something like “yeah well I’m not excited anymore” (even though I can hear it now playing in the living room, as I’m in the bedroom with the door shut)

but I stated getting my homework stuff to go to my room and I said it wasn’t a joke if it hurt my feelings, and he said basically everything hurts my feelings. He said “I can’t close the god damn door without hurting your feelings” and I said it didn’t matter. If it hurts my feelings, it hurts my feelings and I can’t help that. I didn’t choose for it to hurt my feelings. As I’m walking to the door I said something like “well maybe you should find someone who’s feelings don’t get hurt all the time”, and then as I closed my door I don’t remember exactly what I said but it was something like “I’m sorry you can’t stand to be around me” or something like that, but you could tell in my voice I was about to cry, and he hates to see me cry. He always tries to comfort me, and he told me before he never wants to be the one to make me cry. He’s like this a lot where he’ll blow up over something small, but I’m not allowed to be upset or then I’m overreacting. Sometimes he apologizes sometimes not.

And last night we literally just talked about him being more present, more affectionate. I won him a blanket he really wanted at a white elephant Christmas party, and now I can’t remember what he said, but I joked and said something about “its my blanket” and he all but threw a fit. Refused to use it pretty much the entire rest of the day, and kept calling it “MY blanket” (as in me) every time he referenced it. He said it really bothered him because he moved into my apartment recently without a lot of his stuff (cause it’s still at his dads) and doesn’t feel like he has a lot to call his. The thing is, I calmly said sorry and that I didn’t know it bothered him and wouldn’t do it again, but he was being petty about it the rest of the night. But if I said that, he’d get mad at me and say I was overreacting.

He just came in here as I was typing this and said really quickly “sorry I cussed at you, sorry I yelled at you, sorry I made you mad” and I think he said something else but he said it so quickly I don’t know what it was, then left. As you can see, it doesn’t seem like he’s actually sorry. I just don’t know what to do anymore. He was in an abusive relationship for four years, SHE broke up with HIM, he couldn’t do it even though he was getting physically and emotionally abused. He also talked about being abused as a child, and how his dad is narcissistic and I can see it. And I think it’s carrying over into this, and he has shown some signs. I love him. I thought he was the one. But even typing this out I feel like I know better. This is only one small situation out of almost a year of dating.

I just don’t know what to do anymore, I’m sick and tired of life. I have been through so much. I have been through quadruple what he’s been through at LEAST, narcissism and all. And the reason why I say that is I am not perfect by any means, but oh my god at least I am nice and understanding and don’t take everything out on him. He always says “I can’t even breathe without being wrong” because he doesn’t get that he’s the one in the wrong. Like he won’t let me call myself fat and gets very upset and won’t talk to me if I do, but I said I was hungry last night and got a salad out of the fridge and he said “I can tell” I said oh yeah? And he said “you ate a lot of chicken” I had ONE chicken thigh. That’s a lot of chicken apparently, even though he had like four pieces. And we both ate sides, but he commented on the chicken. I didn’t even eat anything after that until dinner, which I had some chips and a chicken wrap. I put the salad away AND HE GOT MAD AT THAT TOO but I didn’t feel like eating anymore.

Sometimes I will mirror the things he does wrong when it’s applicable, because I thought it was help him see that it IS wrong if someone else is doing it. Silly me. He just says if I get called out I always point out something he did wrong too instead. I think he learned a lot of behaviors from his ex.

He isn’t very affectionate. Not very talkative. Doesn’t like to go out. I am the opposite. I need to be touched a lot. I need to talk to you more than just a few words. I want to do things with you, but I will stay at home too. He doesn’t accommodate me. We don’t go out and do anything, except to the bar every Tuesday for a pool tournament. Cause it’s like a dive bar where we all know each other, it’s where we met. He’ll tell me I should hang out with my friends more, or ask me why I don’t hang out with my friends more, then jokes that I’m “leaving him “ when I do. I feel guilty going out, or staying out for long periods of time. On top of all this, I have TWO jobs, going to school full time, and on top of that completing a CMA class.

I just wonder if we aren’t compatible. He’s a nerd, and watches so many tv shows and movies and gets annoyed because I haven’t. I had an ex who did everything up there, wanted to go out with me, wanted to be with me, loved to hear my stories. He was just overly controlling, couldn’t even text my mom without him wanting to read it. Couldn’t even go with my friends without him wanting to be there.

I love him though. I want to have kids with him. I want to spend the rest of our lives together. But, he’s 34. I’m 23. He should be acting his age. He should know better.

Well guys sorry for the trauma dumped book, I just feel like I can’t talk about this with anyone. I don’t want to. I’d rather just tell strangers I guess.

From the get go, this guy was really (too much imo) involved. My manager and mentor are overseas, but this guy is in the office so he volunteered as the unofficial person to show me around.

The thing is, there have been many instances where i believe he acts as if he was my manager, where he asks inappropiate questions that he simply doesnt need to know the answer to (if it helps, he used to be a manager right before this job).

For example. On the day of the anual company party, i had to come really late to the presentation part, and the places to this were limited (even tho there were clearly places left in the venue). The next day he texts me asking why i didnt come, saying that i could have given my spot to his friend. This put me in an uncomfortable place, cos i could have had a personal issue, yet he expects me to answer him.

On the first couple of days at the job, i skipped going to the office on one of the days they come bc i forgot i had an appointment, and didnt say anything (i just didnt know tbh). Again, he asked my i didnt come and started giving me a lecture

I have been having pain on my shoulder when i WFH because i have a shitty plastic chair that is too low, and a desk too high. Then i asked in our work groupchat if the company can provide us with an ergonomic chair. He went on some argument for the company, basically saying that thats why they pay me and that i can buy it myself. One day in person, he made another snarky comment, making fun of it, in front of all the others. Thankfully it went mostly unnoticed

Another day i asked if the company can pay for the taxi back home after the company party, since i live really far away and it might end once public transport is finished. Again, he starts making fun of me for asking for that (but staying professional)

Im really sick of this guy, he's a workaholic and expects us to be the same as him. I am 99% sure he does this with me because im a woman, because he is more experienced than me so he is in a psoition of power, but also because i am less conforming than the other colleagues, as i act a bit like i want and do less of the pretending. Also, i recently was called in one of the director's office because supposedly i am not integrating well (translation, i come one hour later to avoid the useless 1h coffee break, and to sleep more; we have no set schedule btw). I am 99% sure this guy is the one that instigated this and mentioned it to the director, since the others dont really give a shit.

I am not the smartest worker, i quickly lose my patience and react quickly. I have never complained about him yet, but at least i realized that instead of going to the director or my manager, i should first send him a stern message if he ever pulls this shit again

How should i deal with him? Do you think he is right to act like this, or is he going overboard? My coworker that has become my close friend absolutely hates him too",11,1769376887.0,womenEngineers,7,1.0,False

Not naming the restaurant because I don’t want to blow up their spot and based on my observations the staff handled it very well.

About 20 minutes after I got there, a mom and two teen/tween daughters walk in. They’re staring at everyone with wide eyes and the older daughter asked the server “is this ((name of restaurant))?” upon walking in, so I immediately clocked that they were tourists that had found this place online. They sat for easily half an hour, the server was extremely attentive as it was slow, and brought them all water and menus. The mother got into some sort of lengthy exchange with the server. I was listening to an audiobook so I couldn’t make out details, but it was clear she was complaining and he was trying to be accommodating. Maybe 10 minutes after that exchange, all three of them got up and left, without ordering anything, or even acknowledging the man who waited on them for the last half hour.

EDIT: As they were walking out, I also noticed that the daughters had brought pre-packaged snacks into the restaurant and had been eating them at the table.

I get that times are hard, but you’re already on vacation in the city. You couldn’t have ordered a few coffees or something to share and tipped the waiter a couple of bucks? The restaurant is kinda quirky and divey, but not particularly expensive for the area. I get your teenager dragging you somewhere you may not want to eat, but then staying there for 30+ minutes and having someone serve you… nothing?

Basically, are tourists showing up at restaurants for the \~vibes\~ they see online and then leaving without spending any money? Is this really a thing that’s happening? Or did I just witness a random one-off incident?

dark and waiting.  
He lingered at the rim,  
close enough to breathe me in,  
never close enough to sip.  
Loving me fully felt dangerous to him,  
so he learned me from a distance  
and called it care.

He stayed where admiration is safe.  
Where wanting does not require courage.  
He watched the surface,  
the steam, the depth he refused to test.  
He never drowned,  
never let himself find out  
how much of me was warmth  
and how much was truth.

I learned to accept the looking.  
I told myself it was enough  
to be chosen with hesitation.  
But admiration grows tired  
when it is starved of indulgence.  
Eventually, even restraint  
disguises itself as wisdom

I know that free VA Management Systems already exist (to an extent), but I wanted to float an idea to you guys.

  
I'm thinking about building a professional, community first paltform for virtual airlines, something like vamsys but modern, clean and free to use.

My main goal is to provide

**- Flight Logging**

**- Analytical Features and Dashboard**

Eventually, I would like to integrate a whole host of integrations and features like live flight maps. But I would want to perfect what I do best first.

I know “free forever” can sound like just another promise :( and I get the skepticism. I’ve built free platforms before, and it’s something I genuinely enjoy: making professional tools that communities can actually use without worrying about subscriptions or paywalls.

Here’s how we plan to keep it sustainable:

* The **core platform,** rosters, flight logging, dashboards. will **always stay free**.
* Some resource-heavy features, like **live flight tracking**, might be **optional one-time purchases per VA**, but nothing essential will ever be locked away.
* Development will be self-funded at first, with an optional **Buy Me a Coffee-style support model** for anyone who wants to help cover server costs or future improvements.

This approach lets the platform remain **accessible to all VAs**, while still giving a fair way for larger orgs or supporters to contribute.

**Timeline**

I (33F) have been talking to (33M) almost a year and dating about 10 months. For most of that time, we saw each other about 2-3 times a month. Recently, about the last month, we’ve naturally shifted to seeing each other once a week.

**Physical and emotional dynamic**

Sex is not a driver of the connection. We’ve been physically intimate about four times total. Even when we spend the night together, it’s mostly cuddling, watching shows, walking, coffee, and being present. He doesn’t push sex and seems comfortable with emotional closeness. He does out of respect for me, as I expressed wanting a connection not driven by sexual tension. 

**October conversation**

I asked how he felt about our connection and whether it was casual. He didn’t answer yes or no, but said the connection makes him happy. We also both clarified we weren’t dating anyone else. He also said I felt a bit guarded, which he explained was because he hadn’t been to my place yet. He mentioned that meeting friends would make sense at some point and that he wanted to see where I lived.

**December shift**

He came to my place for the first time and spent a full day with me. After that, we started seeing each other more consistently. We had a deep conversation about our pasts, values, relationship preferences, and family. That conversation made me feel especially close to him.

**Future hints**

During December conversations, he mentioned his mom asking about me, which showed me he talks about me to his family. In a separate, practical conversation about housing, I shared that I plan to look seriously for my own place around 2027. In response, he mentioned his family owns property in the city and alluded to the idea of living together someday. It wasn’t framed as a plan, but it also wasn’t random. It seemed protective of him. 

**Current situation**

We continue to spend quality time together. We recently spent the night together, cuddled, watched shows, walked in the snow, and had coffee the next morning. It feels calm, safe, and affectionate. He initiates time together and follows through. We text daily. 

**What I’m unsure about**

I usually initiate deeper reflective conversations about how we connect emotionally. He engages when they happen, but doesn’t initiate them himself. I bond strongly through those conversations and don’t want to assume he bonds the same way. We haven’t met friends or family yet, even though meeting friends was mentioned in the past.

Nothing feels bad or unsafe. I enjoy him and feel respected. It just feels steady without much verbal clarity or direction.

Curious how others would interpret this. Normal slow burn? Different bonding styles? Or a situation that needs a clearer conversation?

**TLDR**

Dating 10 months. Slow burn. Low focus on sex. Strong presence and comfort together. He’s expressed happiness and hinted at future possibilities, but hasn’t clearly defined direction. Connection feels great but ambiguous.",1,1769376659.0,relationships_advice,1,1.0,False

We apparently have almost the exact same interests and hobbies, which is something I always struggled to find in someone I would be attracted to. This did make me very interested in her from the start. Throughout the event we were quite close physically all the time and she initiated physical touch like hugs for example, which is where my confusion starts.

Fast forward to after the event, we're both a group chat now with others that attended and we talk to each other here and there, but I'm usually the one starting the conversation. She isn't too dry on text but it doesn't feel as if she really wants to talk either. I did find out that she will be performing at a concert soon which I offered to attend and she was very excited about that, so my plan was to take flowers with me and offer her a coffee after, but I'm unsure if this would be out of place.

My grandmother used to say the rain didn’t belong to the sky.

It belonged to the dead.

Every drop carried something they’d lost — a memory, a regret, a moment they didn’t get to finish. When it rained, she told me to let it soak into my hair, run down my face, pool at my collarbone.

“Don’t wipe it away,” she’d say.  
“Listen to it.”

I didn’t understand what she meant until the night I died.

I was jogging through Mountsmen Cemetery when it happened. I went there often — it was quiet, wide, and peaceful in a way the rest of town never was. The dead didn’t expect anything from me. They didn’t ask questions. They didn’t look at me like I was unfinished.

The police said I was lucky. Someone found me before it was too late. An anonymous call. A passerby. A miracle.

They used words like *survivor* and *second chance*.

I didn’t feel like I’d come back.

I felt like I’d been taken away from something. Someone.



I woke up in a hospital room that smelled like antiseptic and old coffee. Machines hummed softly around me, the sound steady and indifferent, like they were doing their jobs whether I was there or not. My mother was asleep in a chair beside the bed, her head tilted back, mouth slightly open. She looked exhausted in a way I’d never seen before.

When she realized I was awake, she cried, relief finally loosening its grip on her chest.

I watched it happen like it was happening to someone else.

The doctors asked me questions. My name. The date. Where I was. They asked if I remembered the attack. I told them no, which was mostly true. What I remembered didn’t feel like something I could say out loud.

They told me I’d been unconscious for several minutes. Long enough to worry them. Long enough to start preparing my mother for the worst. Someone had called it in just in time. They never found out who.

“You’re very lucky,” one of them said, smiling too wide.  
I nodded because that’s what you do when people say that.

I stayed in the hospital for three days. I slept a lot. Not dreaming — just sinking. Every time I woke up, I felt like I’d been pulled out of deep water too quickly. My body was there, but my mind lagged behind, like it was waiting for something to catch up.

At home, everything was the same. Same couch. Same chipped mug on the counter. Same framed photo of my mother and me at the beach when I was twelve. But the familiarity didn’t comfort me. It felt staged. Like a set rebuilt from memory.

People kept telling me how strong I was.

I stopped jogging.  
I stopped listening to music.  
I stopped finishing books halfway through chapters.

Nothing felt sharp enough to hold my attention. Everything slid off me.

At night, I lay awake staring at the ceiling, waiting. Sometimes I felt it — a pressure behind my ribs, a tug just below my sternum — like a thread pulling slowly, patiently, from somewhere deep inside me.

I started seeing a therapist because everyone agreed I should. Her office was warm and beige and smelled faintly of lavender. She asked me how I felt about the cemetery now.

“I don’t know,” I said. That was my answer to most things.

She suggested grounding exercises. Breathing. Journaling. Closure.

That word again.

What they didn’t understand was that nothing felt *unfinished*.

It felt interrupted.

The first memory came back to me in pieces.

Not images — feelings.

Warmth.  
Stillness.  
The sense of being known.

I’d be washing dishes or folding laundry when it would hit me, sudden and disorienting, like remembering the end of a sentence I didn’t know I’d started. My hands would pause mid-motion. My chest would ache — not sharply, but deeply, like homesickness without a place.

Once, while standing in the shower, I closed my eyes and felt grass under my bare feet. Cool and soft. I opened them quickly, heart racing, water beating down on my shoulders like rain.

I didn’t tell anyone about that part.

I went back to Mountsmen Cemetery two months after the attack.

I told my mother I was meeting a friend. I told myself I was just going for a walk.

It was early evening, the sun low and soft, throwing long shadows across the headstones.

The gate creaked when I pushed it open. The sound made something in my chest flutter.

“Hey,” I whispered, without thinking. The word slipped out like habit.

I walked the paths slowly, following the rusted cemetery street signs, my sneakers scuffing against the pavement. I didn’t know where I was going, only that I was being pulled. Not dragged — invited.

When I reached the corner, I stopped.

Ross and Burgess.

That was when I noticed the headstone.

It was older than most around it, the edges worn smooth by time. I crouched down to read the name.

**Thomas Whitaker**

Born December 8, 1844

Died May 15, 1864

“I’m sorry,” I whispered, though I didn’t know why. My fingers brushed the stone, just barely.

Warmth bloomed under my skin. 

I walked away, but the feeling lingered — a gentle hum beneath my ribs, like something had recognized me.

That night, I dreamed for the first time since the attack.



**Part 2**

I dreamed of him before I knew his name.

In the dreams, there was no cemetery. No headstones or dates or markers. Just open space and the feeling of being held in place, gently, like the world had finally stopped asking me to move.

He was always there. As if he’d never known a moment where I wasn’t.

When I woke, the feeling lingered. Not like a dream you forget over coffee, but like a memory you don’t realize you’re carrying until it shifts.

I started going back to the cemetery after work.

I told myself it was exercise. Fresh air. Closure.

But I never brought my running shoes.

I walked the paths slowly, following the rusted cemetery street signs, my sneakers scuffing against the pavement. I didn’t know where I was going, only that I was being pulled.

Not dragged — invited.

Sometimes I’d sit on the grass near the older graves, where the stones leaned at odd angles. I’d close my eyes and listen. Not for voices. Just for the quiet.

That was when the memories started coming back in pieces.

Not like flashbacks.  
Like overlap.

I’d be standing there, eyes open, and suddenly I’d feel the weight of someone beside me. Not touching — just close enough to register. The air would warm. My breath would slow.

Once, I smelled smoke. Not sharp or burning — wood smoke, distant and familiar, like it belonged to another century. Another life.

I didn’t tell my therapist about that part either.

I told her I felt disconnected. That the world felt thinner. That sometimes I missed something I couldn’t name.

She said trauma does that.  
I nodded.

What I didn’t say was that the place I missed didn’t feel traumatic at all.

It felt complete.

The first time I remembered his face, I was washing my hands in the bathroom sink at home. I glanced up at the mirror and caught my own reflection mid-thought, my expression softened by something I couldn’t see.

For a second — just a second — his face appeared behind me.

Not frightening.  
Not sudden.

Gentle.

Young.

His hair was dark and unkempt, his expression open in a way people rarely are once they’ve lived too long. He smiled.

I turned around quickly.

There was no one there.

My heart didn’t race.  
I didn’t scream.

I felt… relieved.

That night, I dreamed of sitting on the grass with him. The ground was cool beneath my palms. The sky was overcast, heavy with rain that never quite fell.

He told me his name was Thomas.

I asked him how old he was.

“Nineteen,” he said, and smiled.

In the dream, I didn’t ask how he died. I didn’t ask why he was there. I didn’t ask why I was.

We talked the way people do when time isn’t something they’re afraid of wasting. We talked about the way the world felt there. About how time moved differently. About how quiet it was.

When I woke, my pillow was damp with tears I didn’t remember crying.

I went back to the corner the next day.

I stood there longer this time, staring at his headstone, reading the dates over and over like they might rearrange themselves if I looked hard enough.

**Thomas Whitaker**

“I remember you,” I whispered, my voice barely carrying.

The warmth came back immediately. Stronger this time. A pressure behind my ribs, steady and reassuring, like a hand resting there.

I stayed until the sun dipped low and my phone buzzed with a text from my mother asking where I was.

*On my way home*, I typed back.

It wasn’t a lie.  
I just didn’t specify which home.



**Part 3**

My mother started leaving her bedroom door open at night.

I noticed it the first time I came home late, the hallway light spilling softly into her room. She was asleep on her side, one hand curled around the edge of the blanket like she was holding on to it.

She hadn’t done that before.

She watched me more closely now. Asked questions she pretended were casual. How work was going. Whether I was eating. If I was sleeping.

I told her yes to everything.

Sometimes we sat together on the couch, the television murmuring to itself while neither of us really watched. She’d reach over and tuck my hair behind my ear the way she used to when I was a kid, her touch lingering just a second too long.

“I’m just glad you’re here,” she said once, her voice careful.

I nodded.  
I didn’t trust myself to answer.

The cemetery felt farther away when I was with her. Not gone — just muted. Like music playing from another room. I could still feel it there, waiting, patient as ever.

Thomas never asked me to come back.

That was the worst part.

In the memories — or dreams, or whatever they were — he was never urgent. Never pleading. He listened more than he spoke. When I told him about my life, he smiled like he was learning something precious.

“Your mother loves you,” he said once, matter-of-fact.

“Yes,” I said. The word stuck in my throat.

He didn’t tell me I should stay.  
He didn’t tell me I should leave.

He just sat beside me, close enough that I could feel the warmth of him, that same steady pressure behind my ribs.

Some nights, I woke up with the sensation of grass beneath my fingers, my hands curled like they were remembering something my mind hadn’t caught up to yet. Other mornings, I found dirt beneath my nails and couldn’t remember when I’d gone outside.

I stopped telling my therapist the truth altogether.

She asked me if I ever thought about the attack.

I told her no.

She asked if I felt safe.

I said yes.

Neither of us believed me.

The corner started calling to me more often.

I’d find myself thinking about it in the middle of the day — at the grocery store, at work, standing at the sink rinsing a coffee mug. The thought would settle into me gently, like a reminder I’d set for myself and forgotten.

*You can come back whenever you’re ready.*

The first time I considered what that meant, I was standing in the kitchen with my mother, watching her struggle to open a jar. I reached out automatically, twisted the lid free, and handed it back to her.

She smiled at me like I’d done something heroic.

“Thank you,” she said. “I don’t know what I’d do without you.”

That night, I cried in the shower, the water hot against my skin, my chest aching with a tenderness that felt too big for my body.

I went to the cemetery the next day.

I sat beside Thomas’s grave and told him about her. About the way she left lights on for me. About how she listened for my car in the driveway.

“I don’t want to hurt her,” I said.

The warmth settled behind my ribs, steady and familiar.

I started to understand then that what I wanted wasn’t to die.

I wanted to return.

The difference mattered.  
And it didn’t.

The last time I saw my therapist, she asked me if I believed people could move on from trauma.

“I think some people move toward something else instead,” I said.

She wrote that down.

Not long after, my mother baked a birthday cake and lit the candles, watching my face closely as I leaned forward to blow them out. For a moment, the room smelled like smoke and wax, and I felt that familiar warmth bloom behind my ribs.

I closed my eyes.

I wished for quiet.



**Part 4**

I started going to the cemetery later in the day, when the light thinned and the air cooled. The paths emptied quickly then, the sounds of traffic fading until there was nothing left but wind moving through the trees and the soft crunch of gravel beneath my feet.

My mother asked where I went.

“I walk,” I said.

She watched me carefully, like she was trying to memorize my face. “Be safe,” she said, every time.

I always promised I would be.

The pull was strongest in the evenings. Not urgent. Not insistent. Just there — like a door left open, waiting for someone to notice.

I stopped bringing my phone.

I told myself it was to be present. To think.

The truth was, I didn’t want anything ringing or buzzing or lighting up when I was trying to listen.

Some nights, I stood at my bedroom window and watched the streetlight flicker on and off, the glow stretching across the pavement. I thought about my mother asleep down the hall, the familiar rhythm of her breathing, the way she still checked on me when she thought I wasn’t paying attention.

I thought about Thomas.

About how the quiet never felt empty.

About how nothing there asked me to explain myself.

The last day I went to work, I sat at my desk and stared at the screen without reading a single word. The cursor blinked patiently, waiting for me to type something I couldn’t bring myself to say.

I closed the computer and went home early.

My mother was in the kitchen, humming to herself as she washed dishes. She turned when she saw me and smiled.

“You’re home early,” she said.

“I just wanted to be,” I replied.

She dried her hands on a towel and pulled me into a hug, pressing her cheek against my hair. I stood there longer than usual, breathing her in, committing the weight of her arms around me to memory.

“I love you,” she said.

“I know,” I said.

That night, it rained.

I stood on the porch and let it soak into my hair, run down my face, pool at my collarbone. I didn’t wipe it away.

I listened.

The gate creaked softly as I pushed it open, the sound familiar now, comforting. The paths glistened under the street lamps, slick with rain, the rusted street signs swallowed by the dark.

I followed them without hesitation.

I stopped at the corner and stood there for a long moment, my breath fogging in the cool air. The headstone waited where it always had.

I crouched beside the grave and rested my palm against the stone. The warmth came back immediately, settling behind my ribs like it had always been there.

“I was thinking about my mother,” I said quietly.

The rain softened, then slowed, each drop deliberate.

“I don’t want to hurt her.”

The warmth stayed.

I closed my eyes and let myself imagine it — not dying, not leaving, but returning. The grass beneath my hands. The stillness. The way time felt generous there. The way I never felt unfinished.

I thought about the kitchen light left on.  
The cake candles.  
The sound of my name spoken out loud.

I stood slowly, my knees stiff from the damp ground, and brushed the dirt from my jeans. The cemetery stretched out around me, rows of stones disappearing into shadow.

For the first time since the attack, I felt calm.

Whole.

I heard something then.

Not a voice.

A sound — soft, familiar, just behind me.

I turned.

My wife drinks 3-4 cups of coffee per week and she really likes adding coffee cream. Unfortunately we're loosing the cream. We try bying smaller dose (250ml) but it goes to waste too.

Freezing cream is not a good idea, it changes the taste and texture.

I’m currently residing in North America and looking to invest in a business in Gurgaon (Know the audience and Geo well as I was born and brought up there, so the city has a personal connection for me).

From my research so far, the coffee business (cafes, kiosks, beans distribution, etc.) seems lucrative with strong growth potential and rising consumer demand. However, I don’t have the time to manage day-to-day operations myself. I’m looking to invest capital in return for equity and a recurring RoI.

I’d really appreciate some honest insights from people on the ground:

* Is investing in a coffee business in Gurgaon a good idea right now?
* What are the key risks I should be aware of (margins, rentals, competition, staffing, regulations, scalability)?
* Any legit, revenue-generating businesses that are actively looking for funding partnerships like this? Feel free to DM me the pitch and current business stats (revenue, margins, costs, team size, and growth plan) to take things forward.

1qmvwt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1qmvwt8/different_angle_on_depression_and_motivation_if/,"Different angle on depression and motivation. If you have a slightest bit of energy, please read","Depression, structurally, is not primarily an emotion. It is a failure in the system that authorizes action.



In a healthy state, there is an internal chain which you don't notice when it works:

impulse → evaluation → permission → action


“I should go outside.” → ok → you go.
“I’ll text someone.” → ok → you do.
“I should start this.” → ok → you begin.

Motivation is not energy, it's that “ok.” Depression is what happens when that “ok” collapses.

Impulses still appear, ideas still form and reason still works.
But permission never arrives.

impulse → evaluation → veto → nothing

Every thought is rejected before it reaches behavior, because the system no longer trusts itself to approve anything.

After enough experiences of failure, loss, disappointment, or meaning collapse, the system learns:

“Action leads to pain without reward.”

So it becomes defensive and starts blocking everything in advance. ""Better to do nothing than to risk another collapse"".

From the outside, this looks like laziness.
From the inside, it is loss of authority.

That is why depressed people can think constantly, analyze endlessly, plan in detail, and still be unable to move. Cognition works. Authorization does not.

It is like having a powerful computer whose operating system asks “Are you sure?” for every command, and never accepts “yes.”



Motivational advice fails because it tries to increase impulse.

“Find a reason.”
“Set goals.”
“Visualize success.”

But impulse is not the problem, permission is.
You can have hundred reasons and none will pass.



That is why tiny routines help.
Showering.
Making coffee.
Walking.

They do not require permission. They are pre-approved. They bypass the veto system.
Each small action weakens the blockade slightly.

Another key factor is loss of external legitimacy.
People with clear roles, projects, relationships, or missions often function even when emotionally low, because permission comes from outside.

“I have to.”
“They depend on me.”
“This is my path.”

When that collapses, everything floats.
Then you must authorize yourself.



Depression is not only loss of internal permission, but also loss of external permission.

When people can no longer authorize themselves, they start looking for systems that will do it for them.

Religion.
Rigid routines.
Extreme fitness.
Workaholism.
Political movements.
Spiritual hierarchies.
High-control communities.

All of them do the same thing, they reinstall authority.

They say:

This matters.
Do this.
Go here.
Live like this.
Obey this structure.

And suddenly movement becomes possible again, not because the person is healed, but because permission is outsourced.

That is why depressed people often “recover” inside strict systems.
It's not belief that saves them, it's structure.

Even harsh structure is better than none.

No structure = permanent veto.
Rigid structure = limited freedom, but motion. So people choose motion.

That is also why collapse of belief systems is dangerous.
When religion, ideology, career identity, family role, or life narrative breaks, nothing remains to authorize action. Everything becomes arbitrary.

Why this job?
Why this effort?
Why this relationship?
Why this life?

Without an answer, the system shuts down.
Modern culture often tells people: “You decide your own meaning.”

That sounds liberating.

But for a nervous system in collapse, it is terrifying. It means: you are the only authority.
And if you don’t trust yourself, you have none.

So depression is not just sadness, it's living without a recognized source of legitimacy.

No internal one. No external one.
Just constant review and rejection.

Recovery often begins when either:

a) internal permission is slowly rebuilt
or
b) a temporary external structure is adopted

Healthy recovery moves from (b) to (a).
Unhealthy recovery stays in (b) forever.

Cult.
Dogma.
Addiction.
Identity fusion.

Those are permanent outsourcing.



Depression is the state where you no longer believe your own authorizations, so you freeze because you no longer have authority over yourself.

Recovery is not becoming happy, it's rebuilding internal permission. Slowly.

First for small things, then larger ones, then identity.
Not through thinking, through action.

Every small act done despite the blockade sends a signal: “I can still move.” And the system recalibrates.

Not emotionally.
Structurally.

That is motivation.

Not desire.
Not energy.
Not inspiration.

I enjoy low-key plans — coffee walks, trying new food spots, casual conversations, cozy evenings, or just getting out of the house once a week or every couple of weeks. I’m not big on chaos or pressure — just looking for something genuine and comfortable.

\- Mega Monster: Not rare or DC'd but very odd imo. I never hear anybody talk about it and I never see anybody buy it.

\- Ultra Gold: definitely HTF, might be too old to drink

\- Juice Papillon: Haven't tried it but definitely DC'd and HTF

\- Aussie Lemonade: DC'd and delicious

\- Reserve Kiwi Strawberry: Curious to try, definitely DC'd

\- Reserve Peaches 'N Creme & Orange Dreamsicle: in the process of getting DC'd, both are pretty good and I'm glad Orange Dreamsicle is released again so it doesn't disappear.

\- Rehab Tea + Orangeade: My oldest can(Made in 2015!) and probably the most desirable I think next to the other two elephants in the room. No way am I trying this.

\- Dragon Tea Yerba Mate: Not a tea person, and it's a seven year old can. No

1. Designing the fishes

After each friend told me their favourite fish, I had to make the designs. So I looked at each fish carefully and decided what parts to stylise most and drew them all digitally in Ibis Paint x. 

2. Printing the fishes

This was simple as I only had to print their outlines in A4 paper and have them all in a similar size.

3. Sculpting the fishes

This is where the fun begins. I used DAS white air dry clay and flattened it with a rolling pin until the thickness was around 1 cm. Then I placed each print firmly on the clay and slightly pressed the fish outline with a pencil. Each fish has 3 layers and had to be careful not to rip the paper. After each layer was done, I crosshatched the 2 of them and stuck them together. The third layer was small pieces and I didn’t stick them yet. Finally, I sculpted them a bit and made a small hole so tabs and charms can be placed.

4. Drying the fishes

This part was just patience but anyway I placed them in the oven on low heat for some hours.

5. Texturing the fishes

Making the textures was quite simple. I had different decoupage papers and glued them with a rice paper glue and a paintbrush. Firstly I applied the glue on the fishes, then the piece of decoupage and then applied glue again and left it to dry. For the cracking texture I just used cracking paste and let it do its thing.

6. Painting the fishes

I used acrylics and just had to match their colours to the ones of the digital versions and then let them dry.

7. Gluing the fishes

Another simple part as I just had to glue the third layer pieces with white glue.

8. Oiling up the fishes

I mixed antique paste with some other kind of liquid and then applied it on each fish. Then I had to wipe it with baby wipes but the paste remains on crevices, creating an outline and also some of it remains on the other surfaces, making them seem old and dirty.

9. Making the tabs

Firstly I wrote their scientific names on Word, chose a certain letter type and printed them. After cutting each tab, I dunked them in coffee water two times and they turned crispy and brown. Finally I hung them with a string through the holes.

10. Hanging charms

I bought some charms from a local art shop and hung them from the same holes with another type of string.

11. Adding the “hangers”

I just took some small pieces of flat wood and nailed wire on it, making a “hanger”. Then I glued them behind each fish and now they can be hung on walls.

12. Adding my signature 

I digitally drew my signature, printed it, cut it out with a razor blade and used it as a stamp on the back of each fish.",25,1769376007.0,clay,1,1.0,False

TLDR: Guy with a gf who i’ve met, yet i’m getting signals from him and have developed a major major crush on him. He no longer wants anything to do with me after i’ve confessed my feelings. 

I’ll try to lay out my evidence and counter evidence 

Evidence 

We met in October of 2022. It was a work party, was informed he had a gf then. 

\-we began messaging daily on slack. Never anything appropriate, but mostly work / personal gossip 

\-he came to my birthday party two months later, participated in the surprise. that night while very drunk he told me he liked the way I looked. 

\-A couple of weeks later I admitted I liked him, and he said he doesn’t even want to go there because of his girlfriend. He said he cannot let himself go there. 

\-I backed off. Daily messaging at work slows, but then picks up 

\-fast forward a few months, we are messaging on instagram, Slack, Whatsapp, and Telegram. Never anything appropriate still, just daily check ins and gossip. 

\-at work we are meeting 2-3x a week for lunch. We often go on walks. We meet for coffee if we can’t meet for lunch. He walks me to my car. Still, nothing inappropriate.

\-One night we go for drinks with some other coworkers, the waiter asks if he’s my husband. I’m going insane with all of the strong signaling, others can see it too. 

\-finally decide to have the talk again. he says he doesn’t have romantic feelings for me, and only likes me as a friend. give space .

\-the same behaviour continues as before. Daily messaging, weekly lunches, walks, coffee. We hang out in person sometimes on the weekends. just us two, or with a third friend. 

\-two instances where I “felt something” between us. a very strong hug where our faces were close. and he walked me to the train on his birthday and the air was “charged”

\-one night I see he has sent me 20 messages on telegram, I briefly glance at the notifications. when I wake up in the morning, I notice he deleted them all, I don’t bring it up. 

\-this slow burn has gone on for 2 YEARS. he tells me he is not in touch with his feelings, he starts therapy. All behavior continuing. 

\-one day I break down and tell him I still have very strong feelings for him and cannot get over it. He cuts all contact with me. and I do the same. 

\-Unfollow each other on every platform, no more chatting, no talking IRL. Nothing.

\-We see each other in person at work and he told me I made him feel uncomfortable and he was very angry with me. At this point, I finally understand that I can’t keep being his friend, even if I wanted. 

We don’t speak anymore unless we’re in the coffee line at work and then it’s only surface level. 

What the hell was going on? Everyone i’ve asked (and I begged them to not be delusional) has said it was very clear he had feelings for me. We spent so much time together, he gave incredibly strong signals. As you can tell it takes up a lot of space in my brain and I want an outside perspective to confirm I wasn’t crazy. 

I knew he has a gf, yes. I shouldn’t have let myself get this far in.

I started with a Bialetti Moka Express 6-cup, but quickly realized it’s a bit too big since my partner isn’t a big coffee drinker. I was browsing Amazon for a 3-cup Moka Express and came across this limited Squid Game edition—absolutely loved the color.

Surprisingly, it was even cheaper than the regular Moka Express, so I decided to give it a try. I later noticed it’s made in China, which probably explains the price difference, but performance-wise it seems solid so far.

I made my first brew this morning and the coffee actually tasted richer and smoother than what I usually get from the 6-cup.

Dinner is jacket and tie, lunch is more informal, the prices for both are très cher! If you're in town, I highly recommend stopping by mid-morning for some Pasteis de Nata and coffee. It won't drain your wallet, and it's worth every penny to see the interior. Here is a little video they created:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y4rrQCfM-0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y4rrQCfM-0)

The intro is in Portuguese so here's the translation:

*The Majestic is a historic café located on Rua Santa Catarina in the city of Porto in Portugal.*

*Its importance stems both from the cultural atmosphere that surrounds it, namely the tradition of coffee soirees where various personalities from the city's cultural and artistic life met, and also from its Art Nouveau architecture.*

*In 2011, it was considered the sixth most beautiful café in the world.*

J.K. Rowling has (supposedly) confirmed she wrote the early drafts of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone here while she was an English teacher in town. I didn't find official confirmation of that so I'm dubious, as the Majestic has never been friendly to a school teacher's salary.

What's life actually like?,"Fayetteville people, I need some real talk from locals because I'm considering a big life change. My aunt is moving to Florida to be closer to her grandkids, and she offered to transfer her house in Fayetteville to me for way below market value - $195k (it's worth around $235k based on recent sales in the area). It's a 3-bed/2-bath built in 2010, decent shape, needs minor cosmetic updates but nothing major.

I'm 31, work in digital marketing (fully remote), currently paying $2,100/month for a tiny studio in Boston. I love Boston - the history, the seasons, walkability - but I'm burned out. Winters are brutal, cost of living is insane, and my remote salary would go so much further somewhere else.

Here's what I'm trying to figure out about Fayetteville:

Pros I'm seeing. Way cheaper cost of living. Actual space and a yard. Milder winters (I'm so tired of shoveling snow). North Carolina seems beautiful. Home ownership vs throwing money at rent.

My concerns: What's the weather actually like year-round? Is summer unbearably hot and humid? What's there to do for someone in their early 30s - restaurants, coffee shops, any kind of social scene?

Big one for me: I love long walks and hiking. Are there good trails, parks, nature areas around Fayetteville? I'm used to being able to walk everywhere in Boston - is Fayetteville more car-dependent?

Would I be completely bored coming from a major East Coast city? My aunt keeps saying ""it's quiet but there's plenty to do, and Raleigh is close if you need more,"" but she's 68, so her idea of ""plenty to do"" might be different than mine.

For people who moved to Fayetteville from bigger cities - did you adjust? Any regrets? What do you actually do for fun?

And locals - honestly, is there a good outdoors/nature scene? Quality of life for a single person in their 30s?

My aunt mentioned if I hate it, there are local cash buyers that could buy it quickly, but I don't want to make a decision with an ""escape plan"" already in mind.

Trying to decide by end of February. Any honest insights appreciated - both pros and cons welcome. ",0,1769375778.0,fayetteville,12,0.4,False

I come out, the car is there. It sits Parked at the same spot every time- far from the entrance of the grocery store, facing the exit of the plaza.

I don’t know if this young man (driver). I’ve only seen him once when he pulled up to the Starbucks across the street when I was sitting outside, talking to a friendly older gentleman who paid for my coffee.

i switched it up today for [breakfast](https://imgur.com/i4DliIC) and had some melon with carrot bread and a coffee.  i got out of the house to print a few things at a print shop because i know we're running out of computer paper and, when it's low the chances of the printer jamming are high.  i knew i had some sort of balance on my printer card from when i was a student and i'm glad i charged that card with what money i did when i did.  it must have been during a generous moment.

because it was next door, i did some price shopping at the grocery store.  nothing worth buying, not that i would anyway.  some sort of nuggets are on sale for $1.99 and it seems like a good deal but i don't really want any.  canned soup for $1.00 half off but i don't really want any.  these are the things i'd buy, though.  i sometimes don't understand how this one grocery store is still in business with the prices it charges.  if you've ever been grocery shopping in your life you'd recognize most of these as terrible prices.

i stopped by the canadian tire where i used to work again just for the beacons of hope in the garden section and reminders of spring.  i'd like to live in a retail store right now and i think i've gone from 'security risk' to 'potential customer'.  when i was first out of the hospital, i would often hear someone paging security when i stepped into a retail store.  dollarama every time.  what am i going to steal from dollarama?  i guess i just had that look and frankly i don't blame them.  this is why i need mock interviews for feedback when i'm job searching so that i'll know whether i'm coming off as a loss prevention liability or a prospective good worker because it could go either way.  also what kind of tree i would be and why.

i actually talked to someone i'd worked with today at canadian tire when i'd been the garden center cashier.  i can't say we'd been on especially good terms considering i think she'd had the impression i was on drugs at the time (i was just messed up) but i was a solid worker and carried that garden center when other employees quit.  i showed up every day in 40 degree heat and i remember my boss saying she'd turn the corner sometimes and expect me not to be there.  this was in summer 2021, the first summer after covid so everything was chaos.  it's not my first choice in work, i'd rather use my skills as a personal support worker, but if that job search comes up empty, it seems reasonable i might spend the summer working the garden center again.  they're not hiring for it until some time in april, though.

by the time i got home, i was used to the cold but that might have been because i'd gotten so cold.  taking my coat off, i realized just how cold, thermally, i'd become without really realizing.  [lunch](https://imgur.com/WdXOaem) was bologna on a bun with cucumbers, onion and mustard and a coffee.  took some time to heat up, i'm still cold and probably will be until i take a hot shower.  dinner will be the same [potato curry](https://imgur.com/FUtAHHV) as yesterday and i might make some stovetop [popcorn](https://imgur.com/OlaBhDr) later on.  i'll probably also be doing my yoga routine before bed.  physically, i'm pretty much back to being fit for work, it's mentally where i'm still not there yet.  if i had to work at the bacon factory again i could and it's a job that's not out of consideration.",1,1769375704.0,deardiary,1,1.0,False

I’ve worked with functional medicine practitioners who utilize 16s testing and I’ve done phgg, probiotics, I fast daily and do longer fasts, cranberry/fennel/polyphenols and all the typical recommendations,  even coffee enemas. 

After 0 improvement with symptoms (brain fog, bloating, pots, rosacea, sibo)  that are worse with meals even on my very healthy low histamine diet or on Biomesight I tried no plants gaps; there’s a book but essentially it’s carnivore but you prioritize lots of homemade meat stock and eventually make your own ferments and slowly add those in. 

I did this for a month, my brain fog was gone in 2 days, my sleep improved, resting heart rate and hrv improved (not cured by any means but lots of general improvements). I had the intention of slowly adding back in plant foods and ferments however my diarrhea was so severe I couldn’t take it anymore and stopped. I did a Biomesight test shortly after stopping. My brain fog and symptoms returned after two weeks but my bloating and gas are definitely better. 

I just received my results and I’m floored. Here are the comparisons from October to January. 

Pathobionts: 62 to 98 

Commensals: 69 to 62 

Probiotics: 69 to 83 

Diversity: 96 to 87 

Both pathobionts and probiotics improved. I should note I would intermittently have cocojune yogurt and sauerkraut juice (I couldn’t tell if it flared histamine so not a ton). 

My theory is that I’m eating some sort of plant foods that’s causing my issues and/or it’s leaky gut or my celiac causing issues with plant foods. 

I don’t think carnivore is healthy long term but I’m doing it again for a bit and slowly adding in plant foods and homemade ferments to see what I’m reacting to and hopefully heal my gut lining if that is the issue. Meat stock is very healing so I think that’s been helpful and key to my results. And wonder if starving the pathobionts when I add in plant foods/ferments if my they’ll feed the probiotics now since they’re improving. 

I’m not saying you should do this nor do I think it’s healthy long term and I really believe in the work that Biomesight is doing and appreciate their recommendations. I plan on eventually getting to a place where I can eat a high fiber/rainbow diet. After 3 years and thousands spent later without improvement I’m desperate and also have to let the results speak for themselves. Now that I’ve seen the improvements in my results I’m going to stick with my plan. I should also add I maintained my IF schedule where I stop eating at 11 AM. 

TLDR: After 3 years high fiber/biomesight/practitioner recs/strict healthy low histamine diet with no improvement I did carnivore with lots of meat stock for a month with small amounts of ferments and biomesight results showed pathobionts and probiotics improved greatly. 

Please don’t recommend how a supplement/diet worked for you as chances are I’ve tried it :) I just wanted to share my experience as it’s kind of different than others’ experiences with microbiome healing.

Twice as a coincidence three times as a pattern at this point, I don’t know what to call it. I’ve had pictures of the same car parked in the same spot for about nine months now.. the routine is simple: I walked to the grocery store. The car is not there. I shop for maybe 10 to 30 minutes. I come out, the car is there. It sits Parked at the same spot every time- far from the entrance of the grocery store, facing the exit of the plaza.

I don’t know if this young man (driver). I’ve only seen him once when he pulled up to the Starbucks across the street when I was sitting outside, talking to a friendly older gentleman who paid for my coffee. The young man was skinny, maybe 5’7” covered in tattoos. When I saw him get out of the car I was shocked that he walked right past me. I’ve been not so subtly taking pics when I see the car but he has never attempted to address me.

I wanted to think I was just paranoid until I realized that he could’ve just gone to Starbucks within the same grocery store instead of driving across the street to this one. That’s when I changed my routes and routine.He used to be that he was only there between 11 AM to 3 PM (when I took my lunch break) now it doesn’t matter what time of day or night that I go to the grocery store- I am bound to see him either when I’m walking into then plaza or by the time I get out of the store. Now it’s even more concerning because whenever he arrives, there is a moving truck right next to him. WHAT IS THIS??",1,1769375614.0,venting,2,0.67,False

1qmvmk0,https://v.redd.it/qtmvzbb0akfg1,Lexi throwing a fit.,"This is for the new comers. 
I know this is long but worth the read for the new ones that come see if we’re as bad as Lexi’s makes us out to be. 

This was Lexi after a failed train and she got mad went off screen for like 10 minutes and then come back to say this and ended stream. 

So tell me again she’s not about the money? 

She didn’t care people were still there for her just so many even explain non stop that the can’t and funds are tight.lexi says to them I don’t want excuses no more because you all have lose change in your car. 

Lexi’s response is “I get it but you like your channel you need to support,I’ve heard all I’m gonna cause everyone can afford 1.40 a day that’s a cup of coffee and the famous “I’m worth it”
Yet there’s days she can’t afford coffee creamer. 
I’ll be posting more older stuff just to show it’s not us. 
We just want her to do it the right way. Make all the money you can but do it honestly and truthfully. 
Where the money for that people have for it that didn’t happen? How about the money that was to go towards the “crystals house “ for homeless trans or the money for the first set of teeth that didn’t go for that. That’s all theft by deception and one day the wrong person will actually go legal about it. 

She says no different than anyone else working .

Yes it’s a lot different people work hard and pay taxes on their income. 
Lexi pays nothing and she isn’t happy with just a sub a month and she’s definitely not happy if everyone spent only 1.40 a day.

If you all think I’m wrong then only send $1.40 in bits a night and sub monthly
. 
She would be big mad and threatened to end stream. It’s proven. She just says that to make people come but once they get there they see if the only can afford to sub they are banned. 

Let’s do a little math here. 
She has let’s say 60 viewers a night and if they all dropped 1.40 in bits that would be $87 then let’s say she gets the subs for the month with from the 60 people then that’s $ 497 a month. That would send her into the biggest fit we’ve ever seen. 
Don’t believe it try it for a night or 2. She has made it clear she wants 10 grand a month or more. Her goal for 2026 is quarter of a million dollars. She’s admitted that many times. 

Just sit back and watch you’ll see it’s about money. Whoever is the big spenders at the time is sweetheart,hunnie,love,doll. All to make them feel special at that moment. But that’s not even the end. 
Don’t forgot the 3 wishlist and if she gets another puppy she’ll have another wish list for it too. She even mentioned getting one for house supplies. Never ever do you hear her say here is a wish list for stuff for the littles or even grandchildren. 
Just wait won’t be long shell need one for them 4 kittens that crystal made clear last night that she’s keeping. Speaking of crystal can she go with Lexi for surgery with the flu? That wouldn’t fly here in ny state. ",8,1769375607.0,ladylexisnark2,11,1.0,False

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat and loads up my bags.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I can manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

1qmvm2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1qmvm2r/i_got_it_all_here_are_my_tips/,I got it all - here are my tips,"Truths about manifestation (law of assumption)

I have used law of assumption for the past month (a bit longer) and manifested so many things. You find a list of my successes below as a first step, so you actually know my insights are legit. I have now structured this as a list, so it's easy to take in. Before, I always had the feeling I never quite understood law of assumption and I didn't use it in years.

Robotic affirming actually also gave a love connection with an SP I wanted against all odds (third party, power dynamics, distance), but I eventually stopped affirming, panicked and spiralled a bit because I never understood in the first place how law of assumption worked and what it is actually about.

This is my theory on it which worked like a charm and will always work like a charm, so if you disagree - well, that's on you and I don't mind. This is just my version of things and I stick by it. No need to argue with me about it.

I recommend Taylor Tookes on YouTube btw. She's the GOAT for me.

1. Manifestation via law of assumption is like laws of physics such as gravity - it works all the time and you have no need to doubt it. It is a universal LAW and it works all the time: whatever you assume to be the reality, is the reality.
2. Manifestation via law of assumption works by the idea that if you, henceworth, change your assumption, you change how the world mirrors it to you. Just as with a mirror, you change the person standing in front of it, not the mirror image. So you change what's inside - your assumptions - and it changes what happens in the reflection, so the world around you.
3. Below a few statements you should keep in mind: Don't give people and things free will. They don't have free will. There is nothing morally wrong with that, it's just physics.
4. You don't wait for a manifestation. It is the truth and reality immediately and instantly. The minute you say so and assume it as truth, it is the case.
5. You ""live in the end"". So you live, think and feel, as if you already have what you want because you do (see 4). This means that, of course, you act and think in a way that is appropriate for having your manifestation. If you're together with your hubby and they did not text you yet, you would not freak out and declare they hate you. They are likely busy with work and want to take their time in a quiet moment to actually enjoy their reply to you. Would you be ""checking on the 3D""? No, because wtf, you already have them sleeping next to you, what are you checking on, darling? A bit delulu trying to check on what's already there? In many cases, you don't do shit because you're already there. Your SP already lives with you, the money is already in your bank account, you're already looking forwards to that holiday to Spain, you already have your cute blazer ready that you'll wear the first day of your new job, whatever.
6. Unless it's inspired action. There may be certain intuitive hits coming with which you feel just irresistibly moved to do or say something. No, this does not mean anxiety texting your ex to get them to text back because would you do that if you're back together with them? You know the answer.
7. You don't need to purge anything, overcome ""resistance"" or work through anything. Anything which may come up in the process, you will digest almost momentarily. The old story is dead. You're laughing about it.
8. You don't need to believe anything. Just stick to living in the end and keep living in the end.
9. Methods are not required. You don't need the methods of anyone else. Just do whatever you feel comfy with, you may also just assume the state fulfilled, live in the end and that's it.
10. I personally used robotic affirming of affirmations which felt comfy to me - cursing included, cutesy things I wanted my hubby and I to do, things I wanted to buy, stuff I wanted to achieve. I affirmed myself into a trance almost for a set timeframe, so I only reminded myself that I already had it even though it doesn't need that really - it was just fun for me. It's just fun. You just say what is the case. Play a little The Sims here, go for it.
11. It doesn't ffing take long. My reality mirrored back what I had, said and wanted in a few minutes, a few hours and, at most, a day up to two days or so. You already have it, so no worries and thinking about that anyway.
12. It's a damn universal law, so nothing will stop it. Whatever you assume to be the truth, is the truth. Period. Nothing more, nothing less. Assuming something is connected to a certain behaviour, feeling and and thought process around it. So you assume what you want and live accordingly. If you assume that you're always so unlucky, you'll likely never play the lottery because you are just sooo unlucky. If you think that no person wants you anyway, you'll likely never ask that cute guy out or laugh about it when he asks you out - while he won't do that because no one wants you anyway, eh?
13. It's no ffing complicated. I essentially had to repeat myself in a few points because it's so damn simple and easy. Assume what your new reality is and then just live in the end of that. Period. Nothing more, nothing less.

Things I manifested within this first month (I know that some of these may initially sound like a Wattpad story, but these authors know what's good, so I wanted that):

\-I went out with my former work crush for coffee and we are now in a relationship. Initially I thought there we \*naggy voice\* ""so many obstacles"", well, damn, there weren't  
\--this was a biggie for me because of the presumed obstacles (lol) and because he's quite famous nationally (and also internationally to a degree). Also because one meeting before that couldn't take place. This only led to him to inviting me for lunch and then going crazy loveydovey on me, cancelling essentially a day of work plans and taking me out to a BEAUTIFUL restaurant while driving me there in a big car and shit and spending God knows how many hours with me before he drove me home. I actually also manifested being kissed by him next to peony and lavender somewhere and in front of a skyline. He actually brought me a bouquet of those and kissed me at the end of the night in front of the skyline of a rooftop bar.

\-I look the way I want to (including naturally darker lashes over night, more green eyes, dream body, all the shit)

\-I achieved the things I wanted to at work

\-I started a side business which started out rolling 2,500 Euros of additional income in per month last week

\-When I did not want a certain meeting to happen because I wasn't in the mood (introvert self, lol), I affirmed for it not to happen and all those I did not want to attend got cancelled for different reasons

\-I won the lottery repeatedly (about 6 times now) with the last time raking in a huge sum of money, lol

\-I got through crowded doctor's offices as the first patient to be let in to the doctor's

\-When I was running late for some reason, I always manifested that I would come in with still plenty of time before my appointments - all the time at the EXACT time I manifested

\-I lost a certain document, I thought and I manifested it back and it slipped out of a pile of papers ""by itself""

\-I got done with multiple things I thought would take a really long time for work initially in just let's say 20 min for something I had anticipated 2h for",12,1769375577.0,Manifestation,0,0.93,False
1qmvlwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/1qmvlwh/alexs_story_the_protector_of_mankind/,Alex’s Story (The Protector of Mankind),"Alex Torres was born with a name that sounded like it belonged to someone who actually had their life together.

Alex — protector.

Torres — towers.

He goes by his alias name (Last name spelled back words) TORRES - SERROT

Meanwhile baby Alex was just trying not to choke on his own fist. The universe really said, “Here’s your destiny, kid. Don’t screw it up.”

His heritage came from everywhere — Mexico, the Philippines, Ireland, Scotland. He wasn’t multicultural; he was a walking identity crisis. A human passport stamp collection. A genetic smoothie blended on “chaos” mode.

He grew up around older people. Italian women who treated coffee like a controlled substance. A godfather who communicated exclusively in slow nods that somehow always meant, “I’m disappointed, but I love you.” Grandparents who believed in signs, luck, and rituals that sounded like they were invented during a blackout.

While other kids watched cartoons, Alex was basically being raised by a council of ancient spirits who all had opinions about how he was holding his fork.

School never felt real to him. It felt like a government‑funded escape room where the only prize was debt. He moved through it slowly, not because he wasn’t smart, but because he was like, “Why am I pretending this matters? For a sticker?”

Photography became his escape. Through a camera, he could finally say all the things he didn’t feel like explaining. He saw the truth in people — the sadness they hid, the beauty they ignored, the emotional baggage they dragged around like it was designer.

He fell in love young. Too young. And when it ended, it didn’t just hurt — it reformatted his entire operating system. After that, trust became something he handed out like it was a limited‑edition collectible.

He never announced who he was. He didn’t hide it either. His identity lived in the way he walked, the way he dressed, the way he existed. Quiet. Confident. Mysterious. Like a man who always knows where the nearest emergency exit is.

He wore gold rings like armor. Sunglasses like a shield. He watched the world closely, but he didn’t let the world watch him back. He was basically a stylish cryptid with good lighting.

His twenties were messy — experiments, risks, late nights, questionable decisions, and at least one moment where he stared at the ceiling thinking, “Is this growth or am I just making poor choices with enthusiasm?”

Then everything collapsed.

At twenty‑five, his life fell apart like a cheap folding chair under a heavy truth. Jobs disappeared. School felt pointless. A friend vanished. Sixteen days evaporated into a fog he couldn’t explain. He slept too much. Thought too much. Became a philosophical raccoon rummaging through the dumpster of his own psyche.

Then something shifted.

A whisper.

A feeling.

A cosmic shove like, “Alright dude, get up. We’re doing a character arc.”

He walked away from everything — his home, his inheritance, the family drama, the version of himself he didn’t recognize anymore. He left the life he was given and went searching for the life he actually wanted.

The woods called him.

Nature didn’t comfort him. It roasted him. It humbled him. It stripped him down to the studs. He walked across an entire state alone. Slept under trees. Listened to the wind like it was giving him unsolicited advice. Danger didn’t scare him. People did. Animals were honest. One night, a wildcat circled his tent. He felt awe, not fear. The cat was probably like, “Bro, blink twice if you need help.”

He spent a year on the East Coast rebuilding himself — not becoming someone new, but becoming someone real.

Now, the West Coast calls to him again — a place where city and wilderness meet, just like the two sides of his own spirit.

And beneath everything, something inside him is waking up.

He looks at America — the fear, the uncertainty, the pressure crushing younger generations — and he feels a responsibility he can’t ignore. A duty to speak. To stand up. To protect. To maybe yell at a few people who deserve it.

He reads. He studies. He listens. Spirituality. Religion. The unseen. The unknown. He is preparing for something he can’t yet name.

Some people live a life.

Some people live a story.

Alex Torres is becoming the latter — dramatic, chaotic, existentially confused, and somehow still iconic.",0,1769375566.0,vagabond,4,0.31,False

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat and loads up my bags.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I can manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

1qmviin,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1qmviin/im_tired/,I’m tired.,"**MASSIVE TW FOR FOSTER CARE, ABUSE AND BULLYING**

I am 27, and I can't go to Dunkin Donuts. It's not because I don't like coffee. It's because my foster sister used to work there, and now the smell of burnt espresso makes me feel like I'm 14 again, so scared in that house. Ice cream makes me shiver. Not from the cold. It is a memory of being yelled at for eating, for existing, for taking up space that was not mine. I was living in foster care from ages 11 to 18. 7 years. Mostly abused in those homes. And when I tried to explain to someone, they looked at me as if I was the one who had caused it. Before thinking of listening, my social workers saw me as a ""bad kid"". The people who were supposed to protect me handed me over to people who hurt me, then in their paperwork, they described me as a problem child. The bullying at school was another issue that was not supportive. Because of my ADHD, the kids literally tore me apart. Teachers just watched and did nothing. I understood very early that nobody was going to come and rescue me.

But now I'm an adult, and I should be beyond all of this. That's what everyone thinks, right? That you grow up and move on. Only I didn't get to grow up. I got to survive. And surviving is not something that leaves you with nice memories that you can just put away, it's something that leaves you with a nervous system that doesn't know the difference between a nasty comment on Reddit and the kids who made my life a living hell in middle school.

I sometimes age regress. Non, sexually, mind you, because everyone always thinks the worst. Sometimes my brain just cant deal with being 27 and having all this extra weight, so I go small. I have to go small to feel safe. I decorated my room with plushies and pastel colors and kawaii things because Im trying to give myself the childhood I should have had. But when I look at it, all I see is what I didnt have. The safety I deserved. The protection. The people who should have cared.

I'm in therapy. I take my meds. I do the work. And yet, here I am. I still dissociate for most of the day because to be present is to be able to feel everything, and to feel everything is to drown. A door slams and I go back to being 13. A raised voice and my brain just surfes out. I am not able to watch some TV shows. I can't listen to certain songs. I just can't go to certain places. My life is a minefield of things that I used to consider normal but now they feel like I have broken glass in my chest.

What is the worst of it? The ones who did this trauma are okay. They are fine. They continued with their lives. They are probably not even thinking about me. My abusers tore me apart and then just left, allowing me to be the one who had to gather the pieces and try to create a human being from the wreckage they made. The system let me down, and I never had anyone to hold accountable. No one ever apologized to me. No one even acknowledged it.

And people simply don't comprehend that. They glance at me struggling and conclude that I am exaggerating. That I am being overly sensitive. That I need to simply ""let it go"" or ""focus on the positive."" They don't realize what's it like to be in a body remembers every betrayal, every moment of terror, every time when I begged for help and was ignored.

They don't know what it's like to be trapped in your own mind, realizing that your whole existence now is only a result of things that should never have happened.

I only want somebody to understand. I want to stop feeling as if I'm the problem when I was the child who needed help. I want to quit carrying their shame, their violence, their cruelty as if it's mine to keep. I want to feel comfortable in my own skin. But, above all, I'm just exhausted.

Exhausted from being triggered. Exhausted from struggling. Exhausted from surviving when I just want to live.",1,1769375360.0,ptsd,1,1.0,False
1qmvig3,https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubeBadActors/comments/1qmvig3/how_to_officially_report_the_potential/,How to Officially Report the Potential Exploitation of Older Viewers,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to put together a clear step by step, actionable ""guide"" for anyone who wants to report unethical YouTubers for their pattern of coercive donation solicitation we’ve been seeing recently. As much fun as we have being trolls (and I'm being facetious when I say that), it’s about protecting older viewers (mods) from what's clearly financial exploitation.

**Here's What’s happening:**

* Certain YTers host nightly livestreams where they pressures viewers, including older moderators, to donate, by way of:
   * off-platform monetization solicitation
   * Harassment and coercive conduct
   * Exploitation of potentially vulnerable individuals
* They use YouTube Super Chats and memberships, **plus off-platform payment links** (PayPal, CashApp, Venmo, Buy Me a Coffee), to bypass YouTube's revenue share.
* One viewer of a certain channel, age 78, has mentioned that banks are flagging his donations as potential fraud, and the content creator / host encourages him to bypass these safeguards.  We're also under the impression that this viewer is now physically mailing paper checks to said creator in order to avoid being flagged by his financial institution(s).
* This behavior is repeated nightly and affects multiple older viewers, not just this individual.

**Why this matters:**

This could be considered coercive monetization, harassment, and potential financial exploitation of vulnerable adults, and it may violate YouTube’s Terms of Service.

**How to report:**

1. **YouTube Trust & Safety / Legal:**
   * Email: [legal@support.youtube.com](mailto:legal@support.youtube.com)
   * Include the channel link, timestamps, and transcripts of concerning behavior.
   * Focus on off-platform monetization and coercion of older viewers.
2. **Oregon Department of Justice – Consumer Protection:**
   * Online form: [https://www.doj.state.or.us/consumer-protection/contact-us](https://www.doj.state.or.us/consumer-protection/contact-us?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
   * Email: [help@oregonconsumer.gov](mailto:help@oregonconsumer.gov)
   * Include a description of the nightly solicitation, age of the audience, and the repeated encouragement to bypass fraud alerts.
3. **FTC (Federal Trade Commission):**
   * Online: [https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
   * Choose **“Something else”** as the type of problem.
   * Describe the pattern of coercive online solicitation targeting older viewers, using the narrative about the 78-year-old as an example.

**Tips for submitting reports:**

* Include as much detail as possible: dates, timestamps, links, screenshots, and transcripts.
* Stick to facts—avoid speculation or accusations beyond what’s documented.
* You do **not** need to contact the affected viewer(s) directly; let the authorities handle it.

The goal here is to get the attention of YouTube and regulators so that unethical YouTubers' coercive behavior can be reviewed and stopped, once and for all.

I hope this helps.  I've already reported to all 3, and will continue to until I get a response.

I'll keep you posted.",9,1769375355.0,youtubeBadActors,12,1.0,False
1qmvift,https://i.redd.it/aygmr4379kfg1.jpeg,Alpha Obsidian’s Unwanted Bride,"Chapter 1

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat and loads up my bags.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I can manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

But seriously though, I’d love to connect, text, chat with you a while, and hopefully we have some degree of chemistry! Better yet, I hope you are a chatty and needy type of girl! Speaking of which, on a scale of 0-10 how needy are you? 😄

A bit about me to get the small talk out of the way; 

Love my morning Italian coffee, obviously! I’m having some now as I’m typing lol. 

Love me a good book/read, chill music, lots of international tunes; Spanish, Italian and French. Also, love international cinema! I think French comedies are the best. Haha. 

Enjoy to travel and see the world when I can or can afford it! Speaking of which, let’s go on a trip together? Jk! Relax haha. It will be wild to trace with a Redditor haha. 

Don’t do much outside of work, gym, boring routine, unless socializing with colleagues once in a while. 

Huge fan of English and Spanish football (soccer), and I don’t care if bad bunny is playing in the upcoming Super Bowl half time show lol just saying… I’d probably still watch the game though haha. 

I’m trying to (re)learn Italian and Spanish and always curious about other languages ! So wanna be my language tutor? Haha

That’s a long a&& post! U hope you slide in my dm with a relatively creative and joyful message though haha. 

Cheers

1qmvggj,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinflames/comments/1qmvggj/and_here_we_are/,And here we are,"Met my potential TF almost 2 years ago. Major age / life situation difference but i manifested it and we fell in love. When i fully committed to the rel she bailed. That was in April of 2025. I had never been so heartbroken in my life. She had to block me b/c i couldn’t stop reaching out. Chasing hard. The day it happened i had never cried so hard in my life. Wailing over the loss, sobbing myself to sleep for months. 2 weeks after i found myself she reached out again. I held my frame as was watching her rise but i couldn’t carry it anymore and would have to retreat to recalibrate and stay grounded. I was trying to “hold space” for her. Last Wednesday night, she ran away again. This time is different tho, she wanted me to stay the night and have breakup sex and i couldn’t. I stayed grounded, wished her the best, truly. Told her maybe we’d find each other again, likely not, and then i went home. It was hard to sleep that first night. Thursday night i send her a short text saying i needed to block her temporarily to ground myself and she could reach me via em if needed. I had dreams about her last night and am just gently sending her away again. I reached out to another woman today to go get a coffee next week. This sub has helped me to feel less alone and not crazy lol. Even writing here gives her some of my energy but that’s okay, it’s all a release and it’s going better for me this time around. Just wanted to share / see if anyone has thoughts or can be encouraged. If i could go back, i probably wouldn’t have let her back in so easily. Big love to all of us who can love so deeply!!

1qmvg2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qmvg2w/the_floor_is_sticky/,The Floor is Sticky.,"We moved into the flat above the butcher's two months ago. It was a step down from our old place; John lost his good job and we had to make adjustments.

The place wasn't exactly the Ritz, but it functioned. The wallpaper popped and flaked when you scraped a nail along it, and peeled away at the corner behind the TV. The bathroom taps sputtered feebly as I stood shivering on December mornings, waiting to wash my face. I battled the condensation that hung on the inside of our bedroom window, dreading the mould that would follow.

John and I didn't speak of our diminished circumstances. He'd taken a job at a distribution warehouse, and they were working him like a dog. He was too stressed, too focused on working every hour God sent, and I was too afraid of breaking the relative peace.

I spent my days holed up in the small flat watching daytime TV, skin crawling at the accumulating dust.

The case officer's voice echoed in my head:

*Can you bend over to pick up a pen from the floor? Can you do it now so I can see?*

Shame prickled up my neck. I pushed myself up slowly from the sofa, catching myself on the coffee table as I rose.

I walked into the kitchen to get away from the thoughts, grimacing at the sickly smell leaching up from the butcher's below. Coffee would help.

I flicked the kettle on and leaned back against the counter, shins burning.

It hadn't always been like this. My mind reeled backwards before I could stop it. Back to when we could still pay the mortgage on our three-bed semi. Back when my body still worked, and John could still look me in the face.

A tear burned my eye, and I wiped it away angrily. The wet blur caught a glimmer of light; something shone up at me from the floor. I knelt, knees cracking. It was a clear, viscous film. I touched it hesitantly. Thin, mucosal strands stretched between my fingers. It smelled strongly of petrol.

I wiped my hand on my trousers, confused, and grabbed the damp cloth that lay on the scratched worktop. I wiped away the unknown residue and threw the rag into the sink.

I returned to the sofa and turned the TV up, trying to push the pain out of focus. Bailiffs were executing a writ of possession on an irate shopkeeper. I watched as he attempted to lock the shutters and trap them inside. My mind flitted back to the probing questions of the case officer:

*If you spilled something...Could you kneel?...Can you clean up after yourself?... Show me.*

The bailiff called the police. The shopkeeper spat and swore. The shutters rattled closed. I'd worked my whole adult life. I'd always paid my taxes, never claimed anything. And here I was, begging and cringing for my pittance.

I heard heavy footsteps climbing the metal stairs outside. John was home. He brought an eddy of cold wind inside with him and shut the door without saying anything. I pressed my tongue to the back of my teeth.

""Hey, babe."" I called to the hallway. I got no response. I heard the heavy thud of one boot pulled off, then the other. The footsteps receded into the bathroom.

I turned my eyes back to the TV, chest heavy. The shopkeeper was calling his cousin to come and beat up the bailiff. His vicious words were censored out with a long, shrill bleep.

****

John and I sat on the sofa, microwave meals on our laps. I twisted a fork through the yellow slop that was supposed to be carbonara, eyeing the pink flecks of meat.

John sighed. I looked over at him, longing to touch him.

""How was your day?""

He shrugged. ""Same as always.""

He didn't look at me, and I didn't press him. Fatigue was etched onto his face. I looked at the grey hunk of lasagne on his tray. A rainbow of oil glinted at me from the edge of the plate. My brow furrowed as I watched him lift his fork. A thin tendril clung to it and stretched upwards towards his mouth.

""John?""

He looked back at me, irritated. ""What?""

""Nothing."" I didn't want to bother him. The food was barely edible anyway, I didn't need to put him off.

He looked back at the TV and we sat in silence. The shopkeeper spat venom at the police officer, and was shoved head first into the car.

****

I took a deep breath and stood up from my stool by the kitchen sink. I plunged my hands back into the tepid dishwater and resumed washing. I lifted out a plate, disturbing a prism of colour on the water's surface.

I stopped, watching the colours ripple as the water settled. I looked at the plate again; smeared across it was the same oily film. I scrunched my nose at the petrol smell.

I turned on the tap, trying to rinse it away, but it clung there insistently.

I scrubbed. The pain in my wrists flared. When I finally set the clean plate on the rack, my fingers felt tacky, as though I’d dipped them in glue. I squirted 4 pumps from the soap dispenser and rubbed my hands together frantically in the hot water until they turned red.

****

The next morning, I sat in my usual place on the sofa, watching passively as a toothless woman screamed obscenities at her philandering husband. The host gleefully sat between them on the stage, scorning the man for his disloyalty. A huge security guard held the man's jacket as he grew red in the face, desperately trying to throw a punch at the presenter.

My mind kept going back to the kitchen, agitating over the stain. *Had I gotten all of it? What even was it? A chemical? Something soaking up from the butcher's?* I switched off the TV just as the woman's sister bypassed the security guard and launched herself at the man, scratching his face.

My ears rang in the silence.

*Could you mop the floor on a bad day?*

I stood up and walked into the kitchen, bare feet careful on the cold tiles.

****

It was back.

The puddle sat in the same place as before, just to the left of our rickety table. The light from the window caught it and reflected back a familiar oily rainbow. It didn't move, or change, it just waited. The smell of gasoline hit me again, but this time something lay underneath, sweeter, cloying. Animal.

****

I hovered awkwardly in front of the butcher's counter, waiting for him to appear from behind the metal curtain. I shifted my weight from side to side to ease the ache in my shins.The smell was stronger down here, and I tucked my chin down into my hood to escape it. I had only met the butcher twice, and I would rather have kept it that way. He was fat and balding, but carried himself with unearned confidence. His lecherous smirks put me on edge; I had tried my best to avoid him, until now.

A fly buzzed around a hanging slab of meat, and I watched it with revolted fascination. The curtain jangled. I looked round to see the butcher stride into view.

""Well, hello again beautiful. I was wondering when you'd come and say hello. Did you miss me?""

""Um... no, I needed to ask you about something.""

""You didn't miss me? You're breaking my heart love. Why don't you give me a smile eh?""

""Look, I think some of your chemicals are soaking through into our flat. I keep finding this... stain in the kitchen.""

""You going to invite me in eh? We could have some fun you know. I won't tell that bloke of yours.""

""For Christ's sake, listen to me!"" I shouted. ""Whatever you're using down here, it's leaching upstairs. I need you to check if there's a... hole or a... a crack or something that's letting it through.""

His face grew cold. The empty stupidity behind his eyes vanished and was replaced with rage. I saw then that he was not just a pest but a dangerous man. I stepped backwards.

""There's no need to be rude. Fucking bitch. I'd be doing you a favour you know. Fat bitch like you.""

""I'm sorry, I uh...""

He leaned closer. An animal stink rose off his body. Sweat, and blood.

""You come down 'ere, accusing me, and now you're sorry?""

""Please... I'm not accusing you. I'm just worried about the chemicals-""

""What chemicals? I don't use no chemicals. You think I can't run my own shop?""

""No...no. I just thought maybe... something in the pipes...""

""You're a mental bitch, aren't you?""

I cringed, backing away. He slammed his hand down on the counter. I flinched and recoiled. I turned on my heels and ran back up the stairs.

""Fuck off then you stupid slut! Tell your bloke I said hello!"" He shouted after me, barking laughter.

****

My teeth ground against each other as I worked, sweat dripping from my forehead onto the soapy tiles. The hard bristles scraped forward, dragged back, as my shoulders burned with the effort.

The stain seemed thicker now, more resistant. The brush kept catching against the floor, the oily residue gathering behind it. I fought against it bitterly, scalding my hands in the rinsewater. The smell of bleach and gasoline made my head swim, until finally the floor was clean. I leaned back on the counter, breathless and exhausted.

I heard the familiar heavy boots pounding up the stairs. I looked around guiltily. John appeared in the door frame and looked down at me, irritation on his face.

""What the fuck are you doing?""

""I uh, I was just cleaning the floor. There was a...stain that has been bothering me.""

""You're going to make yourself ill. I can't take time off to look after you.""

""I know, I know, I'll be fine. I just... had a bit more energy today.""

""You know what the doctor said. The last thing I need is you going downhill again.""

""I'm sorry, John."" My hands shook as I looked away from his disappointed face.

He sighed angrily and stomped away. His footsteps disappeared into the bedroom, and the door slammed.

I sat there, sweaty and ashamed, and looked back at the floor. It gleamed innocently as I stood up and turned off the light, shutting the door behind me.

****

I was seated at a table, endless darkness surrounding me. In front of me lay a vast chessboard. My opponent sat opposite, clipboard obscuring their face. I couldn't remember sitting down, couldn't remember the game starting. I looked at my pieces; I had lost all but 3.

""What's happening?"" I asked, confused.

""Are you able to wash independently?"" A deep, flat voice asked.

""Wh...what? Yes... I can wash...""

My pawn moved forward. A black knight claimed it.

""Are you depressed?"" My bishop slid diagonally. A castle knocked it off the board.

""I'm not depressed, I just.... I'm just unwell. I can't...""

""Are you a burden to your friends and family? Is there anyone left, you stupid slut?""

Checkmate.

****

I awoke with a jolt, cold sweat on my face. I gasped for breath as the room swam back into focus. I breathed a deep, shuddering sigh. I lay there for a moment, trying to calm my racing heart. I decided a cup of tea would be the best thing. I threw back the covers and went to sit up... and couldn't. Panic rose again through my body as I looked around wildly. I strained hard and pulled my leg up from the mattress. A long, thick tendril stretched away from it like toffee. I screamed.

****

I awoke with a start as a bus went rattling by the window, and turned over to see John looking back at me, smiling softly.

""Morning, babe. How are you feeling?""

I scanned my body; my shoulders throbbed horribly. I tried to recall the nightmare, but it slipped away from me like sand clenched in a fist. My mind snapped back to my pain; I would pay today for my efforts.

""I'm fine. Long shift today?""

""I should be home around 6."" He leaned closer, worry in his eyes, and gently kissed my lips. ""Get some rest today, don't push yourself again. I'll bring home dinner.""

""I promise."" I said, smiling back at him. My fingers curled under the sheet.

****

The door shut behind John, and I lay there in the silence, my promise hanging in the air. I stared at the ceiling for a long time, focusing on a cobweb in the corner. A spider spun its prey endlessly around and around between its legs.

I pushed up from the bed with a grunt. John had left me a coffee on the bedside table, and I drank it gratefully, savouring the warmth that spread through my aching chest. I shuffled into the living room and flicked on the TV, volume low.

A crime scene cleanup show was on; a grim intervention with masked men in hazmat suits. I sipped my coffee as they worked through a filthy, cluttered kitchen, shovelling heaps of mouldy paper and rotting food into black bags.

In the centre of the floor lay a deep, purple stain, blooming wide on the filthy linoleum. The edges looked iridescent under the light of the camera, like petrol on wet tarmac.

One of the men took a utility knife and began to slice open the linoleum, pulling back strips of sodden underlay and revealing the rotting floorboards underneath. As he pressed down to lever a section free, his gloved hand stuck. I watched as he tugged, and a long, viscous strand stretched between the glove and the floor. He yanked upwards and it snapped with a wet smack.

My stomach lurched. I fumbled the remote and the TV clicked off. My pale face stared back from the black screen, eyes wide.

*Do you find yourself fixating on small things more than you used to, like household messes for example?*

I had to go and see.

****

I waited in the hallway, breath shallow in my chest. I willed myself to turn the handle, scolded myself for being so childish. Of course there would be nothing there, the floor was immaculate. I was just stressed, just imagining things. My hand shook as I turned the handle.

****

I stood in the doorway as unreality washed over me.

The kitchen was unrecognisable. The substance had spread almost wall to wall. Writhing tendrils were climbing up the table legs and counters. Smaller patches had seeded on the walls and the fridge. The smell burned my eyes; the heady petrol had mixed with the stench of rotting meat, amplified to a choking crescendo. My knees buckled. I grabbed the door frame, desperately trying to hold myself up.

I watched as a twisting arm snaked up the fridge, slithering up to the handle and nudging the door ajar. The cold white light shone on the remains of a roast chicken, slowly liquefying under a blanket of sludge. Nausea came over me in waves. A bubble grew and popped, hissing.

The once clear film had turned a deep, bruised purple, and thin rivulets were sprawling outwards like veins. I clapped a hand over my mouth. A tendril that had been creeping unseen towards my feet reared back at the sound. I slammed the door.

****

""John, please, I need you. Please, just come home.""

""Can't you just tell me what's wrong? I really can't leave, they'll take away my overtime. We'll be fucked.""

""Please John, I wouldn't ask if it wasn't an emergency. Please just come home.""

He sighed angrily. ""Fuck's sake. OK, I'll be there in 20.""

I hung up the phone and paced back and forth on the balcony, fighting down the hysterics. I tried desperately to cling onto rationality. To make sense of this. But there was no understanding it. I sat on the bottom step, curling my arms around myself, and stared hard at the ground.

John arrived 10 minutes later, and shoved open the gate with irritation. His face broke as he caught sight of me, and he rushed to my side.

""Babe? What's wrong? What's happened?""

""John... I... I can't...""

""It's OK,"" he said soothingly. ""Just tell me what's going on.""

""The kitchen... the floor...""

""What is it?""

I just looked at him weakly. I couldn't say it. I gestured back towards the door.

""Stay here.""

Heavy boots thudded up the stairs behind me. I waited for the scream. Nothing came.

""John?"" I looked round. I couldn't see him.

Panic shot through me. *It must have swallowed him. I sent him in there with no warning and it got him.*

I raced up the stairs and flung open the kitchen door, and saw John, standing in the centre of the room looking confused. The substance lay underneath his feet, flat and yielding.

""Babe? There's nothing here."" He said, using the same quiet voice he used when I had my flare-ups.

I stared at him. At the stinking purple mess pulsing beneath his feet. At the sprawling veins still climbing the walls, now reaching the ceiling. ""John... it's everywhere.""

He sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose. ""Maybe you should lie down. I'll get you some water.""

""John, please-"" I took one step towards him, and a writhing tendril wrapped quickly around my ankle. It burned, searing pain shooting up my leg. I gasped and fell forward, landing on my knees directly onto the substance.

It gave like thick gravy. More vines shot upwards, twisting around my wrists and ripping them downwards. I gasped in horror and pain. A deep, wet sucking sound rose from below. It pulled me down. The stench was maddening. I stared at John for help, but he just stood there, brow furrowed, looking at me.

""I'll call the GP in the morning. You're obviously hallucinating. The stress, the pain, it's all too much.""

""John!"" I screamed helplessly as the hungry liquid compressed my abdomen, lurching upwards. The burning agony made it impossible to think. It squeezed the air from my lungs. I went limp, giving in.

John was already turning away. ""I'll speak to my boss. I've got some holiday saved... it will be OK... I'll try and get home early tonight.""

The last thing I heard was the front door clicking and John's heavy boots on the stairs.

We argue a lot, closeness and intimacy have disappeared from our relationship, and without them all the problems have only grown bigger. This morning, my husband got up and made breakfast. As usual. He cooks, I clean. He called me to come eat. I had just gotten dressed and went to make coffee for both of us. By the time I got to the table with the mugs, my husband had already finished eating. It upset me, because we used to have breakfast and dinner together, often talking and enjoying the time. It’s one of many little rituals we no longer have. I made an ironic comment like, “Well, that was a nice breakfast together.” That made him angry. He said that the first thing I do in the morning is complain instead of thanking him for making breakfast so I didn’t have to lift a finger. Then he stopped, looked at me angrily, and said: “Say: Thank you for breakfast.” I just stared at him, so he repeated it: “Did you hear me? Say: Thank you for breakfast.” He repeated the command a third time. I finally said, “Thank you for breakfast. Are you happy?” He said yes and walked away. My thank-you wasn’t sincere at that time and he knew that. That’s why it felt less like forcing gratitude and more like a display of power. Later he said it wasn’t about thanking him, but that I could have said I’d be there in five minutes and he would have waited — even though I asked him if he wanted coffee and then went to make it. I understand that my ironic comment wasn’t the best way to start the day. I also understand why it made him angry. I acknowledge my mistake. But still, the way he forced me to say thank you really shook me. He ordered me like a general orders a soldier — more than once — and stood his ground completely. Now I’m wondering: was this just a one-time outburst, or is he showing controlling tendencies he’s been hiding? Am I making this into something bigger than it really is?

TL;DR: Husband made breakfast, I made coffee, he finished eating before I sat down. I made an ironic comment, and he repeatedly ordered me to say “thank you.” Felt like a power move. Am I overreacting?",3,1769375196.0,marriageadvice,10,1.0,False
1qmvfo3,https://i.redd.it/boe7mkdp8kfg1.jpeg,Alpha Obsidian’s Unwanted Bride,"Chapter 1

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat and loads up my bags.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I can manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

1qmvf85,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1qmvf85/the_blurred_boundaries_of_a_workplace_friendship/,The Blurred Boundaries of a Workplace Friendship,"I am a 46-year-old man. For two years, I worked with a woman colleague who was 50 years old and four years older than me. We are both married and have two children of the same age. We got along very well. We chatted, went to lunch together or with other colleagues. She also brought me homemade meals because she knew I enjoyed my food. Sometimes she would give me cakes and snacks, a bit like a big sister, I thought. Sometimes she acted childishly towards me; for example, one day she ran up to me to talk, like a child, and then she would tease me during a conversation. Whenever a meal was organized at work for a celebration, she insisted that I attend because I don't like gatherings with colleagues. Afterwards, she would become colder and more distant. Sometimes she would ask me to go out with her at lunchtime to do some shopping. She often suggested outings with the children, but I always refused because I didn't want to see a colleague outside of work.



Then I had problems with management, a kind of harassment that I found very difficult. For several months, I didn't speak to anyone at work, focusing on my tasks and trying to get through this difficult period. This colleague tried to find out why I was isolating myself, and I simply replied, ""I have a lot of work,"" without any further explanation. One day, I ran into her by chance on the subway, and she came over to talk to me, suggesting we travel together. She behaved in a way I would describe as flirtatious (she got very close to me, pressed her chest against my arm, leaned in very close to talk to me). One day, she even came into my office to look at something on my screen and stood very close to me. I didn't know how to react because she's older, and I was quite surprised.



I then found another job in a different office, and my departure was announced. This colleague then came to see me, congratulated me, asked when my last day was, and told me she was inviting me to lunch that day. On the appointed day, she invited me and asked if she had done something wrong, why I wasn't speaking to her anymore. I explained that I had been harassed and had looked for another job, which I had found. She warmly congratulated me, praising how I was ""comfortable in my job,"" ""funny,"" etc. She was relieved that my distant attitude wasn't coming from her. She then continued to make flirtatious gestures, such as surreptitiously touching my hand with her index finger while she was eating. I then told her that, since I was moving to another office, we could stay in touch and meet up for family outings with the children and their spouses (perhaps that was a mistake on my part!). Delighted, she seemed very excited when I contacted her to suggest an outing with the children, but I noticed that she didn't let her husband know when we were getting together. That's why I then suggested family outings with the spouses. She agreed and organized several outings during the summer, and we saw each other regularly. With our respective spouses. I thought our relationship was wonderful. Except that sometimes, when I went out with my children and didn't let her know, she would point it out: ""You didn't call me, that's not nice."" Yet, she did call hers, but frankly, I didn't care. She brought little treats and snacks, prepared picnics. Always seemed very enthusiastic. She also started criticizing her husband, saying he wasn't involved, that he just stayed home drinking coffee, and that he was old. When I asked her about how they met, she told me he was the one who flirted with her and that she wasn't interested at first because he was unemployed. In short, it wasn't love at first sight. She also asked me to download TV series for her and put them on a USB drive, something her husband could have done. When her husband was around, her behavior changed. She became silent, distant, and didn't talk as usual. You could tell she was growing distant from him. He, on the other hand, seemed very much in love.

She had promised to show me a recipe. I suggested she come over with her family, that we all cook together, and then eat the meal together. But one day, after an outing with her son and my son—unusually without their partners—she said, ""We'll meet at your place for the recipe."" Okay, when I got to my house I thought we'd chat over coffee or tea, but she refused. She started cooking all by herself, did the dishes, without saying a word. Very strange. Then she said, ""The meal is ready.""""Well, I have to go now."" Then she left without even talking. It was a really strange scene, in my opinion.



She had planned a trip to Spain with her family. I told her I knew the country well and that I preferred Portugal. She then decided to go to Portugal with her family. I found that odd.



She started by organizing outings with both families herself, booking hotels, suggesting hikes, barbecues, and meals at home. She also planned outings with the children, like going to the pool, etc. She even wanted our two families to go to a foreign country together, to a chalet in the mountains. She also suggested organizing a girls' night out for herself and my mother at a spa. Then, after about ten intense outings and several dinner invitations to each other's homes, she suddenly stopped contacting me. She used to call to suggest outings on the spot, etc. One day, her husband was supposed to help me assemble a piece of furniture, something we'd planned for weeks, but on the day, he stood me up. She intervened to force him to keep his promise, and when I came to pick him up in my car, he told me in the car during the drive, ""If she wants us to separate, no problem."" I didn't understand her intervention.



Then, nothing more... I texted her several times to see if everything was alright, and she replied briefly. I then sent New Year's greetings to her husband, but received no response. She had promised to give me contacts for renovation companies, which she never did.



So, several months later, I confronted her by text message, still without any news... I asked her why we had disappeared and why she hadn't given me the promised information about the renovations. She wrote to me that she was on vacation. I wrote back: ""You two have disappeared without giving us the promised contact information; you're freeloaders."" Then she called twice, but I didn't answer. She then replied with something like: ""A true friend would have tried to find out why someone is distancing themselves,"" and concluded: ""This is where our relationship ends.""",0,1769375162.0,ToxicRelationships,0,0.5,False

1qmvdie,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qmvdie/theres_a_wendigo_living_in_my_apartment/,There's a Wendigo living in my Apartment,"Ok, let me start by saying I’m *not* Native American and have been relying on Google and Wikipedia for my research. That being said, I’m pretty fucking sure there is a Wendigo living in my apartment building. 

 

It sounds nuts, I know, but there it is. I first got suspicious when I heard someone had started renting 9G in my high-rise.  9G is a notorious apartment. Its so notorious that if you live in the same city as me, you now know what building I live in. It’s been vacant about seven years now, since some Dahmer wannabe was caught there with a kitchen full of corpses.

 

They had to drop the price of every unit after that. Which is why I moved there. It made the place affordable for someone bussing tables. Of course the whole thing creeped me out, but I figured there’d already been one serial killer there. What were the odds on two? 

 

I moved into 9C and the whole 9th floor smelled real funky for the first few weeks I was there.

 

“It’s dead bodies.” My neighbor, Ninety, informed me. I still don’t know his real name. I call him Ninety because he lives in 9D and looked like he was, well, you get it. He used to call me Stevie, because he said it was a wonder I had a job with the way I looked. 

 

“They’ve cleaned the place twice. Too cheap-ass to replace the floors. Soaks in ‘em. Can’t ever get the smell out after that.” Ninety had shook his head. He said it as if he had experience. That’s when I decided it was best to stay on his good side. Eventually they gutted the whole unit, sorry, and the smell went away.

 

I mention it because that was the absolute worst thing I’d ever smelled, until about a week after the new tenant moved in. At first I thought it was the same smell of death, but it wasn’t. There was something frigid and moist all at once in this new smell, like you were taking in lungfuls of a rotting deer on a winter’s night. I started leaving my window open for fresh air, sitting out on the fire escape to avoid it. Then, as it got colder, I got candles and incense.

 

“You some sorta witch now, Stevie.” Ninety asked when I first started lighting them. He’d been in the hall, glaring down at 9G which is how he spent a lot of his time. 

 

“No, just trying to get rid of that smell.”

 

Ninety took a deep breath in. “Like a week-dead bison by Old Faithful in midwinter.” He spat on the hall carpet, thick and yellowy. “Brew some coffee and be a man.” Then he’d gone back inside.

 

Obviously, my initial thought was that whoever was in 9G was killing people. So, I tried to keep an eye on anyone coming or going. There was never anyone. Hell, I’ve only ever seen him twice. Wish I hadn’t. 

 

First time was late one night, early morning, about a month after he moved in. I’d picked up a late shift at the restaurant I work at. Some rich asshole had thrown a bunch of money at the owner to stay open late; I’ve always had a problem saying no to authority figures, so I agreed to pull a double shift. I tried to rationalise it as a paid excuse to avoid the smell for a while. The flip side to that was I then had to trudge home, overworked and exhausted, knowing that smell was waiting for me.

 

I’d just reached the 9th floor hall and there he was at the other end, unlocking his door. He was tall, freakishly tall, like near 7 foot despite being hunched over. Baggy clothes clung to a skeletal frame like blankets draped over branches. He had his hood up and the only bit of skin visible was his hands. Old, worn leather stretched too tightly across bone. Stretched to ripping. 

 

“Fuck me.” I muttered to myself at the sight. His head snapped round to look at me. Yellow eyes gleamed bright from within the hood that hid his features. It was death itself. The hall contracted around me until I could feel the absence of its breath on my face. A talon-like finger raised to my eyes and I jerked back, bashing my head on the elevator. Suddenly we were at opposite ends again and he turned from me to enter his apartment. 

 

I locked and bolted my door immediately. Then I slid down it and I cried. I hadn’t been so terrified since my dad caught me smoking pot at 15 and said he was gonna call the police and I’d go to jail. It's that deep terror, axis shifting. The sort of terror that doesn’t come from thinking you’re about to die, but that you’ve just accidentally switched tracks from a normal life to something darker and beyond your control. 

 

Hand to heart, I really thought I was living two doors down from a vampire. Pale, deathly smell, only seen at night.  Vampire. So, I fished out the crucifix my gramma got me for confirmation and displayed it round my neck. Garlic cloves to adorn my doors and mustard seeds by my bed. Recited the Lord’s prayer before bed, and Psalms 23 anytime I had to walk down the hall just to settle my nerves.

 

I made sure I was always back in my apartment by sundown, which was easy enough before winter. Sleep was difficult. I’d lie awake with the rot in my nose and visions of those yellow eyes just outside my window. As I’d drift off, I’d hear a tapping. Faint. Like a bony finger beating against my door. I woke up in a panic the first time and rushed to my peephole. Nothing. Windows all clear. So, I lay down and as I drifted off: tapping. Every night was the same.

 

I should have moved. Of course I should have. But at the time it was easy to put up roadblocks. To rationalise it away. I was imagining things. I didn’t have the money. Who would believe me. What line could I use instead to explain. The train of thought always led to me being seen as crazy by everyone, or sleeping on the streets. So, I stayed. I stayed and I pretended I didn’t hear the tapping at my door. When it woke me in the night I said it was just a dream. 

 

It’s the kind of thing that’s easy to chalk up to imagination, but I never could convince myself. Then last week it happened somewhat louder than before, like someone slamming against my door. I jolted up and darted over, though not before grabbing the crucifix. The door across from me was open. My neighbor, Ninety, stood there in tighty-whities and a vest, gun in hand. I’m not good with guns, so all I can say is that it was a pistol. He scratched his temple with the barrel and I could see a faded yellow image on the gun beneath his fingers. Never seen anything like it. 

 

I threw open my door. His eyes darted to me, but the pistol didn’t move, thank God. Probably not a good idea to spook a guy with a gun. 

 

“Y'hear that?” He asked. 

 

“Yeah. Every night for weeks now.” I said. He gave me a look, like sizing up my words. Deciding if he believed me.

 

“It’s the freak in 9G.” He said. He wasn’t looking at me anymore, just glaring down the hall like he hoped that door would open. “Think I’ll have a *neighborly chat* with him""

 

“Wait!” I hissed. My hand went to his shoulder as soon as he moved by me. He stopped and those faraway eyes suddenly focused right on me. I let go of him. “I just mean, tempers are high. Why not wait until morning.” 

 

His eyes lingered on me, then to my other hand. My crucifix. “Morning? So we can drag him out of his coffin.” He shook his head and continued down the hall. I backed into my apartment and watched from there, where I could quickly slip behind the threshold. 

 

Ninety stood at the door to 9G and delivered three short, sharp, raps. There was no answer. A moment passed and silence hung heavy in the air, making it hard to breathe. He tried again, louder this time. Harsh. Staccato. Slams. Each delivered with his pistol hand. Still, there was nothing from beyond. Something shifted in Ninety’s posture then. He took up a wide stance, pistol arm straight across his body, pointing at the door. His other hand went slowly to the handle. He twisted it and held, then turned to me. 

 

He was going to say something. I know he was. But he didn’t get the chance. The door lurched open and he was pulled in with it. Pulled in. He didn’t fall in, he didn’t run in, he was pulled in. I’d like to say I ran after him, crucifix drawn, to save my neighbor. Instead I slammed my door shut and called 911. 

 

It took an hour for the police to arrive. More than enough time for him to drain Ninety’s blood and hide the body. I didn’t expect them to find anything.

 

 They didn’t come to my apartment, but I saw them through the peephole. Two officers looking bored and half-asleep. One had his hands on his belt like he was trying to keep his pants up, the other wore sunglasses despite the time. They knocked on Ninety’s door first, probably some procedure they had. My mouth went dry when the door opened a crack and a weathered face appeared. Lips dry and cracked. Sunken eyes, and stretched skin. It wasn’t Ninety.

 

“Sorry to disturb you at this hour, sir. We’ve had reports of an altercation.” Officer Belt said as if he wasn’t talking to a corpse.

 

“Alter-what? Someone say I been fighting?” Ninety said. Clear as day it was his voice. His voice coming from that thing.

 

“Report was that you’d been attacked and dragged into 9G.” Officer Glasses said. I stared at the rolls of fat on the back of his neck trying to make sense of what I was hearing. 

 

“First I heard of it.” 

 

“Of course, sir. Sorry to bother you. Have a good night.” Officer Glasses said. And that was it. No follow up, no checking 9G, they turned and left. Muttering about crank calls. I watched them through the peephole until they vanished from sight, then my gaze returned to the door opposite. 9D. It was still open a crack. One catlike eye stared dead ahead at my door, my peephole, me. 

 

The door to 9D flew open and I darted back. I was trapped. The fire escape. My only hope was the fire escape. My fingers scratched on the rough frame and I fumbled before the pane finally flew up and a gust of wintry air grabbed at me. My handle squeaked behind me as I clambered out. Then there was a knock. 

 

“Hello, anyone home?” It was Officer Glasses. I stopped, straddling my windowsill. Fool that I am, I nearly went over to the door. My instinctive reaction to obey authority. But then I remembered Ninety’s voice coming from that thing. The hesitation was enough. My door exploded open, splinters peppered my back and side. I fell onto the fire escape and scrambled.

 

Pain needled down the left side of my body as I ran, and crawled and fell down the side of the building, not daring to slow or look back. Something caught my leg at one point, but whether it was the wendigo or just random debris I don’t know. I reached the ladder and threw all my weight on it; it didn’t budge. 

 

That’s when I made the mistake of turning. It lunged at me. Bony arms extended like spears aimed at my throat. Mouth open to reveal all too human teeth that were yellowed and cracked. It should have been so light. For how thin it was, it shouldn’t have weighed anything at all. 

 

I managed to protect my neck and got my left arm near snapped clean off for the privilege. It felt like a rusty saw made of static shocks tore through my bone. Made my vision go cloudy. And all the while it pressed on me heavier and heavier. An impossible weight. Those teeth came closer and closer; there was no rush in it now. The thing was enjoying itself, taking its time. 

 

Then the ladder finally gave. The wendigo and I both fell to the floor with an almighty clang. This was soon followed by flashing blue lights and a quick blast of siren. Headlights illuminated me and I had to squint to make out officers Glasses and Pants sat in their cruiser.

 

The wendigo was gone.

 

The officers took me to the hospital, figuring I must’ve been high or something. I was treated for a spiral fracture, concussion, and two dozen other minor injuries including an array of splinters. I haven’t been back to my apartment since then. Tried to stay anywhere with lots of people. It seems to want to stay under the radar. I’m in the library at the moment. Current theory is it’s a wendigo, so I’m trying to work out how to kill it. Everything just says silver, like they’re werewolves.

 

I’m hoping someone here can help.

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat and loads up my bags.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I can manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

1qmvcoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qmvcoo/theres_a_wendigo_living_in_my_apartment/,There's a Wendigo living in my Apartment,"Ok, let me start by saying I’m *not* Native American and have been relying on Google and Wikipedia for my research. That being said, I’m pretty fucking sure there is a Wendigo living in my apartment building. 



It sounds nuts, I know, but there it is. I first got suspicious when I heard someone had started renting 9G in my high-rise.  9G is a notorious apartment. Its so notorious that if you live in the same city as me, you now know what building I live in. It’s been vacant about seven years now, since some Dahmer wannabe was caught there with a kitchen full of corpses.



They had to drop the price of every unit after that. Which is why I moved there. It made the place affordable for someone bussing tables. Of course the whole thing creeped me out, but I figured there’d already been one serial killer there. What were the odds on two? 



I moved into 9C and the whole 9th floor smelled real funky for the first few weeks I was there.



“It’s dead bodies.” My neighbor, Ninety, informed me. I still don’t know his real name. I call him Ninety because he lives in 9D and looked like he was, well, you get it. He used to call me Stevie, because he said it was a wonder I had a job with the way I looked. 



“They’ve cleaned the place twice. Too cheap-ass to replace the floors. Soaks in ‘em. Can’t ever get the smell out after that.” Ninety had shook his head. He said it as if he had experience. That’s when I decided it was best to stay on his good side. Eventually they gutted the whole unit, sorry, and the smell went away.



I mention it because that was the absolute worst thing I’d ever smelled, until about a week after the new tenant moved in. At first I thought it was the same smell of death, but it wasn’t. There was something frigid and moist all at once in this new smell, like you were taking in lungfuls of a rotting deer on a winter’s night. I started leaving my window open for fresh air, sitting out on the fire escape to avoid it. Then, as it got colder, I got candles and incense.



“You some sorta witch now, Stevie.” Ninety asked when I first started lighting them. He’d been in the hall, glaring down at 9G which is how he spent a lot of his time. 



“No, just trying to get rid of that smell.”



Ninety took a deep breath in. “Like a week-dead bison by Old Faithful in midwinter.” He spat on the hall carpet, thick and yellowy. “Brew some coffee and be a man.” Then he’d gone back inside.



Obviously, my initial thought was that whoever was in 9G was killing people. So, I tried to keep an eye on anyone coming or going. There was never anyone. Hell, I’ve only ever seen him twice. Wish I hadn’t. 



First time was late one night, early morning, about a month after he moved in. I’d picked up a late shift at the restaurant I work at. Some rich asshole had thrown a bunch of money at the owner to stay open late; I’ve always had a problem saying no to authority figures, so I agreed to pull a double shift. I tried to rationalise it as a paid excuse to avoid the smell for a while. The flip side to that was I then had to trudge home, overworked and exhausted, knowing that smell was waiting for me.



I’d just reached the 9th floor hall and there he was at the other end, unlocking his door. He was tall, freakishly tall, like near 7 foot despite being hunched over. Baggy clothes clung to a skeletal frame like blankets draped over branches. He had his hood up and the only bit of skin visible was his hands. Old, worn leather stretched too tightly across bone. Stretched to ripping. 



“Fuck me.” I muttered to myself at the sight. His head snapped round to look at me. Yellow eyes gleamed bright from within the hood that hid his features. It was death itself. The hall contracted around me until I could feel the absence of its breath on my face. A talon-like finger raised to my eyes and I jerked back, bashing my head on the elevator. Suddenly we were at opposite ends again and he turned from me to enter his apartment. 



I locked and bolted my door immediately. Then I slid down it and I cried. I hadn’t been so terrified since my dad caught me smoking pot at 15 and said he was gonna call the police and I’d go to jail. It's that deep terror, axis shifting. The sort of terror that doesn’t come from thinking you’re about to die, but that you’ve just accidentally switched tracks from a normal life to something darker and beyond your control. 



Hand to heart, I really thought I was living two doors down from a vampire. Pale, deathly smell, only seen at night.  Vampire. So, I fished out the crucifix my gramma got me for confirmation and displayed it round my neck. Garlic cloves to adorn my doors and mustard seeds by my bed. Recited the Lord’s prayer before bed, and Psalms 23 anytime I had to walk down the hall just to settle my nerves.



I made sure I was always back in my apartment by sundown, which was easy enough before winter. Sleep was difficult. I’d lie awake with the rot in my nose and visions of those yellow eyes just outside my window. As I’d drift off, I’d hear a tapping. Faint. Like a bony finger beating against my door. I woke up in a panic the first time and rushed to my peephole. Nothing. Windows all clear. So, I lay down and as I drifted off: tapping. Every night was the same.



I should have moved. Of course I should have. But at the time it was easy to put up roadblocks. To rationalise it away. I was imagining things. I didn’t have the money. Who would believe me. What line could I use instead to explain. The train of thought always led to me being seen as crazy by everyone, or sleeping on the streets. So, I stayed. I stayed and I pretended I didn’t hear the tapping at my door. When it woke me in the night I said it was just a dream. 



It’s the kind of thing that’s easy to chalk up to imagination, but I never could convince myself. Then last week it happened somewhat louder than before, like someone slamming against my door. I jolted up and darted over, though not before grabbing the crucifix. The door across from me was open. My neighbor, Ninety, stood there in tighty-whities and a vest, gun in hand. I’m not good with guns, so all I can say is that it was a pistol. He scratched his temple with the barrel and I could see a faded yellow image on the gun beneath his fingers. Never seen anything like it. 



I threw open my door. His eyes darted to me, but the pistol didn’t move, thank God. Probably not a good idea to spook a guy with a gun. 



“Y'hear that?” He asked. 



“Yeah. Every night for weeks now.” I said. He gave me a look, like sizing up my words. Deciding if he believed me.



“It’s the freak in 9G.” He said. He wasn’t looking at me anymore, just glaring down the hall like he hoped that door would open. “Think I’ll have a *neighborly chat* with him""



“Wait!” I hissed. My hand went to his shoulder as soon as he moved by me. He stopped and those faraway eyes suddenly focused right on me. I let go of him. “I just mean, tempers are high. Why not wait until morning.” 



His eyes lingered on me, then to my other hand. My crucifix. “Morning? So we can drag him out of his coffin.” He shook his head and continued down the hall. I backed into my apartment and watched from there, where I could quickly slip behind the threshold. 



Ninety stood at the door to 9G and delivered three short, sharp, raps. There was no answer. A moment passed and silence hung heavy in the air, making it hard to breathe. He tried again, louder this time. Harsh. Staccato. Slams. Each delivered with his pistol hand. Still, there was nothing from beyond. Something shifted in Ninety’s posture then. He took up a wide stance, pistol arm straight across his body, pointing at the door. His other hand went slowly to the handle. He twisted it and held, then turned to me. 



He was going to say something. I know he was. But he didn’t get the chance. The door lurched open and he was pulled in with it. Pulled in. He didn’t fall in, he didn’t run in, he was pulled in. I’d like to say I ran after him, crucifix drawn, to save my neighbor. Instead I slammed my door shut and called 911. 



It took an hour for the police to arrive. More than enough time for him to drain Ninety’s blood and hide the body. I didn’t expect them to find anything.



 They didn’t come to my apartment, but I saw them through the peephole. Two officers looking bored and half-asleep. One had his hands on his belt like he was trying to keep his pants up, the other wore sunglasses despite the time. They knocked on Ninety’s door first, probably some procedure they had. My mouth went dry when the door opened a crack and a weathered face appeared. Lips dry and cracked. Sunken eyes, and stretched skin. It wasn’t Ninety.



“Sorry to disturb you at this hour, sir. We’ve had reports of an altercation.” Officer Belt said as if he wasn’t talking to a corpse.



“Alter-what? Someone say I been fighting?” Ninety said. Clear as day it was his voice. His voice coming from that thing.



“Report was that you’d been attacked and dragged into 9G.” Officer Glasses said. I stared at the rolls of fat on the back of his neck trying to make sense of what I was hearing. 



“First I heard of it.” 



“Of course, sir. Sorry to bother you. Have a good night.” Officer Glasses said. And that was it. No follow up, no checking 9G, they turned and left. Muttering about crank calls. I watched them through the peephole until they vanished from sight, then my gaze returned to the door opposite. 9D. It was still open a crack. One catlike eye stared dead ahead at my door, my peephole, me. 



The door to 9D flew open and I darted back. I was trapped. The fire escape. My only hope was the fire escape. My fingers scratched on the rough frame and I fumbled before the pane finally flew up and a gust of wintry air grabbed at me. My handle squeaked behind me as I clambered out. Then there was a knock. 



“Hello, anyone home?” It was Officer Glasses. I stopped, straddling my windowsill. Fool that I am, I nearly went over to the door. My instinctive reaction to obey authority. But then I remembered Ninety’s voice coming from that thing. The hesitation was enough. My door exploded open, splinters peppered my back and side. I fell onto the fire escape and scrambled.



Pain needled down the left side of my body as I ran, and crawled and fell down the side of the building, not daring to slow or look back. Something caught my leg at one point, but whether it was the wendigo or just random debris I don’t know. I reached the ladder and threw all my weight on it; it didn’t budge. 



That’s when I made the mistake of turning. It lunged at me. Bony arms extended like spears aimed at my throat. Mouth open to reveal all too human teeth that were yellowed and cracked. It should have been so light. For how thin it was, it shouldn’t have weighed anything at all. 



I managed to protect my neck and got my left arm near snapped clean off for the privilege. It felt like a rusty saw made of static shocks tore through my bone. Made my vision go cloudy. And all the while it pressed on me heavier and heavier. An impossible weight. Those teeth came closer and closer; there was no rush in it now. The thing was enjoying itself, taking its time. 



Then the ladder finally gave. The wendigo and I both fell to the floor with an almighty clang. This was soon followed by flashing blue lights and a quick blast of siren. Headlights illuminated me and I had to squint to make out officers Glasses and Pants sat in their cruiser.



The wendigo was gone.



The officers took me to the hospital, figuring I must’ve been high or something. I was treated for a spiral fracture, concussion, and two dozen other minor injuries including an array of splinters. I haven’t been back to my apartment since then. Tried to stay anywhere with lots of people. It seems to want to stay under the radar. I’m in the library at the moment. Current theory is it’s a wendigo, so I’m trying to work out how to kill it. Everything just says silver, like they’re werewolves.



I’m hoping someone here can help.

1qmv6r6,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1qmv6r6/time_looped_chapter_200/,[Time Looped] - Chapter 200,"*Two minutes?* Will looked at the woman.

She seemed unusually calm. Even with her healing skills, there had to be more than that. She had to have something to keep the lancer, and likely several more participants, at her beck and call.

“I wanted to meet you,” Will went with the honest approach. “That’s all.”

The woman kept on staring at him for several seconds, then took a phone from the side of her desk and typed in something.

“You got yourself five more minutes,” she said in a calm, slightly less dismissive voice. “So, what do you think?”

“Think?”

“Now that you've met me, what do you think about me?”

“You’re confident,” Will said the first thing that came to mind. “Too confident, suggesting that you’ve been in control for a long time.”

It didn’t hurt that she had an impressive number of skills. The letter size was so small that the only thing visible in the messages above her was the woman’s name. Will would have to approach in order to read them better, but all his instincts warned him to keep his distance.

“Are you from the first cohort?” the boy asked.

“The first cohort,” the woman scoffed, letting out a stream of steam as she vaped. “You’ve joined in Alex’s obsession. I warned the boy that it would be the death of him, and I was right.”

There was no denying her words. The goofball was clearly obsessed.

“No, I’m not. I was forced in several phases after him. Serves me right for doing my sister a favor.”

“You were tricked into joining eternity?”

“In a manner of speaking. It was the one day I agreed to take care of my nephew before work. The piece of shit was a complete nuisance. We just *had* to go through the arcade.” The woman took a few puffs. “And we did.”

“Your class mirror was at the arcade?” That came as a shock. Had Will known, he would have tried to claim it a lot earlier. How hadn’t he caught that during the paradox loop, though? “You moved it,” he added a few seconds later.

“So, you’re not a complete idiot.”

“What about everyone else from the radio tower?”

“Where do you think I got the idea?” Oza smirked. “Lots of people offered me favors back then. A new face of a powerful class is usually easy to manipulate. Tough luck that they got stuck with me.”

A slight smile formed on Will’s face. He could imagine it.

“Find that amusing?” The woman was quick to wipe it off. “You were manipulated even before joining eternity.” She narrowed her eyes a fraction. “Or haven’t you figured it out yet?”

“I want to ask you about the rest.” Will desperately changed topic. The approach was sloppy, but he was counting on that would give him an advantage. The woman liked to remain in control, so amplifying his confusion was a way to make her slip up. “Especially the first cohort.”

“You really thought I was from the first?” It almost seemed that the woman displayed genuine curiosity.

“No,” Will replied. “I thought you might have seen them, though.”

The answer earned him another long stare. Outside, the faint sounds of sirens were heard. Local law enforcement, along with media representatives and every onlooker with a smartphone, were responding to the chaos that Will had caused entering the building. Instinctively, the boy turned his head, glancing out through the full-sized windows.

“Don’t worry about them,” Oza said, keeping her glance on him. “They’ve already caught the perpetrator.”

The explanation sounded too absurd. Will went up closer to the window. As she said, the police were dragging a scruffy-looking man in handcuffs. All the attention seemed to be focused exclusively on him.

Unexpectedly, there was a knock at the door.

“Yes,” Oza raised her voice.

The door opened, letting one of the interns inside. It was one of the people Will had passed by, though for whatever reason the man didn’t appear to have recognized him. There wasn’t a trace of fear in his eyes. If anything, the intern was a lot more terrified of Oza.

“Two coffees,” the intern said.

“Put them there.” Oza gestured towards a small side table in her office.

The intern nodded with the obligatory smile, then did as he was asked and rushed out.

“The mentalist,” Oza said. “Usually, she’s a bitch to deal with, but she was curious to see you up close.”

Immediately, Will thought back to events prior to his entering Oza’s office. There was no way he would have missed any other participants. Of course, that was assuming everything he saw was real. The mentalist had the powers to change reality on a whim.

“Who knows, she might even fall for you. The mentalist has always had a thing for rogues. I’ll have my coffee now.”

Will looked at the small table. This was clearly another power play, and all he could do was go along with it. We went to the table and took one of the cups. In the past, the pain would have caused him to instantly let him go. Thanks to a number of endurance skills, the boy was able to carry it all the way to Oza’s desk and place it carefully in front of her.

“What more can you tell me about her?”

“Tell you?” The woman picked up the cup and took a sip. “I don’t have to tell you anything.”

“Not for free.”

“Boy, there’s nothing you can possibly offer.”

“I have clairvoyant skills,” Will said. It didn’t matter anyway, since she’d forget after he ended the prediction loop.

“I’m aware.” She took another sip. “How do you think I knew you were coming? The clairvoyant happens to be a very good friend of mine.”

*Rather, she has to be,* Will thought.

All the mental and physical damage predictions caused on a constant basis were pretty rough on the user. The clairvoyant would have to need healing on a constant basis, which meant that Oza could take advantage of her any way she liked. As long as she wasn’t obvious about it, there was no favor she couldn't demand in return.

“Then why see me at all?”

“You’re a new player. A rising star, some say. It’s always good business to get to know people early. It’s only a matter of time before you require my services.”

“Didn’t you just say that I don’t have anything to offer?”

“You’re mixing things up. There’s nothing you can offer, but there’s a lot that I can ask. Do you think that the idiots protecting me are doing so of their free will?” The woman snorted. “They know that if they piss me off, they’ll go on top of my shit list. And with the reward phase coming, that’s not something they can afford.”

“You’re participating?”

“I’m not an idiot.” The woman frowned and then looked at her phone. “Since you have a few minutes left, I might give you some free advice. Not that you’ll take it.”

Oza took another sip of her coffee, then placed the cup on her desk and took a puff of her vaper.

“Stay out of it,” she said. “You don’t have the chops to make it to the reward phase, so don’t even try.”

Will didn’t say a word, but the answer was plastered all over his face.

“I knew you’d react like this.” The woman turned to her monitor. “You can go now. I have a lot to do and—”

“I have a sponsor,” Will interrupted.

The reaction was part lie, part spite, but it had the desired effect. For a fraction of a second, Oza tensed up, then redirected her attention back to the boy.

“I’ll make it to the reward phase,” Will continued, keeping the momentum. “I want to know what follows after.”

“After the reward phase?” For the first time, the woman had to venture a guess. All her preparations hadn’t prepared her for such a turn in the conversation.

“That, too. For now, I’d settle for after the start. Only ten participants reach it at a time, give or take. I need to narrow down the field.”

“So, you know about the wildcards.” Oza continued looking at him intently to the point that Will wondered whether she didn’t have some kind of eye as well. “And what’s your offer?”

“What’s your price?” he asked. The boy was smart enough to know that she wouldn’t hand over anything for free. Being in a prediction loop tipped the scales in his favor way too much.

“As I told you, there’s nothing you can give me. If you get to the reward stage, things might change.”

An obvious Catch-22. In order to pay her price, Will had to reach the reward phase on his own, in which case he would no longer need her help. In all honesty, he didn’t know what her help would result in. What he really needed was to find the location of her mirror and claim her class for his own. Everything else was, to a large extent, misdirects and bullshit.

“In other words, no deal.”

“No *deal* this reward phase,” Oza clarified. “If you’re capable as you believe you won’t have trouble reaching it again. Consider it proof you’re serious.”

*Yeah, right.* “I’m listening.”

“A fragment strap,” she said. “You can only buy them from reward merchants.”

“What’s it do?”

“That’s something you’ll have to find out on your own. So, do we have a deal?”

“And what will you offer in exchange?”

“What you asked for: information.”

It was a bad deal, but it didn’t look like it would ever come to that.

“Don’t get any bright ideas, though. I’ll drip-feed you the information piece by piece. You can use all the prediction loops you like, and you still won’t get anywhere.”

“I know.” Will turned around.

“One last thing,” the woman said. “Can you turn to your left?”

The request was so strange that Will couldn’t help but comply. The moment he did, a spear shattered the massive window in front of him, piercing his head.

 

**Restarting eternity.**

 

“Shit!” Will caught his face with both hands.

Everyone stared at him. Several people readied their phones just in case. If he were to faint or have a serious issue, they wanted to be able to post it online as quickly as possible. Much to their dismay, there was no sign of blood when Will removed his hands. Annoyed by the missed opportunity, the rest of the students continued their way into the school.

“It’s okay, bro.” Alex grabbed him by the shoulder.

“Weirdoes,” Jess said as she and Ely passed by.

“Yeah.” Will closed his eyes for a few seconds, pushing the experience out of his mind. “That b—” Will began, but quickly stopped himself. It was only now that he realized—this wasn’t his old loop.

“Warned you not to visit her,” Alex said. “Understand now?”

“She broke the prediction loop,” Will uttered.

“Yeah, there are ways around everything if you’ve been doing this long enough.”

*That’s why you told me about her.* The goofball could have mentioned a dozen other participants, but he had chosen the cleric, just to give Will a taste of the real competition. Actually, it was worse. Oza wasn’t even aiming to become a ranker. She was more than happy sitting in her large office, like a spider in a web, and having others come to her for favors. The real competition had to be way worse.

“Let’s take a walk,” Alex said. “I could use some fresh muffins.”

The two went to Spenser’s, where the goofball bought his daily ration of pastries. All the time Will remained silent. The experience was harsh, but it also was an indication of where he stood.

*First the firefox, now this*, he thought. There could be no doubt that he had a long way to go and not a lot of time to get there.

“You know, this place is why I call Spenser Spenser,” Alex tried to brighten the mood. “When he first joined eternity, he tried to fit in by selling stuff,” he laughed, spitting muffing crumbs as he did. “One loop I said to him: you remind me of this guy who sells snacks at my school. He’s been Spenser ever since.”

“Can I get there?” Will asked. “Can I become strong enough to reach the reward phase?”

The question didn’t receive an immediate answer.

“That’s a tough one, bro,” Alex admitted. “Right now, no. You have moves and you were lucky with a few skills, but you’re a long way off. We all are. Maybe as a team we can make it to day five, but even that’s a stretch.”

“So, there’s no way?”

“Like I said, there’s a way for everything in eternity. I just don’t know it.” The goofball gave Will a pat on the head. “But hey, I’m not the rogue anymore. You’re the class that finds things out.”

1qmv6g9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1qmv6g9/im_tired/,I’m tired.,"***MASSIVE TW FOR FOSTER CARE, ABUSE AND BULLYING***

I am 27, and I can't go to Dunkin Donuts. It's not because I don't like coffee. It's because my foster sister used to work there, and now the smell of burnt espresso makes me feel like I'm 14 again, so scared in that house. Ice cream makes me shiver. Not from the cold. It is a memory of being yelled at for eating, for existing, for taking up space that was not mine. I was living in foster care from ages 11 to 18. 7 years. Mostly abused in those homes. And when I tried to explain to someone, they looked at me as if I was the one who had caused it. Before thinking of listening, my social workers saw me as a ""bad kid"". The people who were supposed to protect me handed me over to people who hurt me, then in their paperwork, they described me as a problem child. The bullying at school was another issue that was not supportive. Because of my ADHD, the kids literally tore me apart. Teachers just watched and did nothing. I understood very early that nobody was going to come and rescue me.

But now I'm an adult, and I should be beyond all of this. That's what everyone thinks, right? That you grow up and move on. Only I didn't get to grow up. I got to survive. And surviving is not something that leaves you with nice memories that you can just put away, it's something that leaves you with a nervous system that doesn't know the difference between a nasty comment on Reddit and the kids who made my life a living hell in middle school.

I sometimes age regress. Non, sexually, mind you, because everyone always thinks the worst. Sometimes my brain just cant deal with being 27 and having all this extra weight, so I go small. I have to go small to feel safe. I decorated my room with plushies and pastel colors and kawaii things because Im trying to give myself the childhood I should have had. But when I look at it, all I see is what I didnt have. The safety I deserved. The protection. The people who should have cared.

I'm in therapy. I take my meds. I do the work. And yet, here I am. I still dissociate for most of the day because to be present is to be able to feel everything, and to feel everything is to drown. A door slams and I go back to being 13. A raised voice and my brain just surfes out. I am not able to watch some TV shows. I can't listen to certain songs. I just can't go to certain places. My life is a minefield of things that I used to consider normal but now they feel like I have broken glass in my chest.

What is the worst of it? The ones who did this trauma are okay. They are fine. They continued with their lives. They are probably not even thinking about me. My abusers tore me apart and then just left, allowing me to be the one who had to gather the pieces and try to create a human being from the wreckage they made. The system let me down, and I never had anyone to hold accountable. No one ever apologized to me. No one even acknowledged it.

And people simply don't comprehend that. They glance at me struggling and conclude that I am exaggerating. That I am being overly sensitive. That I need to simply ""let it go"" or ""focus on the positive."" They don't realize what's it like to be in a body remembers every betrayal, every moment of terror, every time when I begged for help and was ignored.

They don't know what it's like to be trapped in your own mind, realizing that your whole existence now is only a result of things that should never have happened.

I only want somebody to understand. I want to stop feeling as if I'm the problem when I was the child who needed help. I want to quit carrying their shame, their violence, their cruelty as if it's mine to keep. I want to feel comfortable in my own skin. But, above all, I'm just exhausted.

Exhausted from being triggered. Exhausted from struggling. Exhausted from surviving when I just want to live.",2,1769374633.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

1qmv4z1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1qmv4z1/time_looped_chapter_200/,Time Looped (Chapter 200),"*Two minutes?* Will looked at the woman.

She seemed unusually calm. Even with her healing skills, there had to be more than that. She had to have something to keep the lancer, and likely several more participants, at her beck and call.

“I wanted to meet you,” Will went with the honest approach. “That’s all.”

The woman kept on staring at him for several seconds, then took a phone from the side of her desk and typed in something.

“You got yourself five more minutes,” she said in a calm, slightly less dismissive voice. “So, what do you think?”

“Think?”

“Now that you've met me, what do you think about me?”

“You’re confident,” Will said the first thing that came to mind. “Too confident, suggesting that you’ve been in control for a long time.”

It didn’t hurt that she had an impressive number of skills. The letter size was so small that the only thing visible in the messages above her was the woman’s name. Will would have to approach in order to read them better, but all his instincts warned him to keep his distance.

“Are you from the first cohort?” the boy asked.

“The first cohort,” the woman scoffed, letting out a stream of steam as she vaped. “You’ve joined in Alex’s obsession. I warned the boy that it would be the death of him, and I was right.”

There was no denying her words. The goofball was clearly obsessed.

“No, I’m not. I was forced in several phases after him. Serves me right for doing my sister a favor.”

“You were tricked into joining eternity?”

“In a manner of speaking. It was the one day I agreed to take care of my nephew before work. The piece of shit was a complete nuisance. We just *had* to go through the arcade.” The woman took a few puffs. “And we did.”

“Your class mirror was at the arcade?” That came as a shock. Had Will known, he would have tried to claim it a lot earlier. How hadn’t he caught that during the paradox loop, though? “You moved it,” he added a few seconds later.

“So, you’re not a complete idiot.”

“What about everyone else from the radio tower?”

“Where do you think I got the idea?” Oza smirked. “Lots of people offered me favors back then. A new face of a powerful class is usually easy to manipulate. Tough luck that they got stuck with me.”

A slight smile formed on Will’s face. He could imagine it.

“Find that amusing?” The woman was quick to wipe it off. “You were manipulated even before joining eternity.” She narrowed her eyes a fraction. “Or haven’t you figured it out yet?”

“I want to ask you about the rest.” Will desperately changed topic. The approach was sloppy, but he was counting on that would give him an advantage. The woman liked to remain in control, so amplifying his confusion was a way to make her slip up. “Especially the first cohort.”

“You really thought I was from the first?” It almost seemed that the woman displayed genuine curiosity.

“No,” Will replied. “I thought you might have seen them, though.”

The answer earned him another long stare. Outside, the faint sounds of sirens were heard. Local law enforcement, along with media representatives and every onlooker with a smartphone, were responding to the chaos that Will had caused entering the building. Instinctively, the boy turned his head, glancing out through the full-sized windows.

“Don’t worry about them,” Oza said, keeping her glance on him. “They’ve already caught the perpetrator.”

The explanation sounded too absurd. Will went up closer to the window. As she said, the police were dragging a scruffy-looking man in handcuffs. All the attention seemed to be focused exclusively on him.

Unexpectedly, there was a knock at the door.

“Yes,” Oza raised her voice.

The door opened, letting one of the interns inside. It was one of the people Will had passed by, though for whatever reason the man didn’t appear to have recognized him. There wasn’t a trace of fear in his eyes. If anything, the intern was a lot more terrified of Oza.

“Two coffees,” the intern said.

“Put them there.” Oza gestured towards a small side table in her office.

The intern nodded with the obligatory smile, then did as he was asked and rushed out.

“The mentalist,” Oza said. “Usually, she’s a bitch to deal with, but she was curious to see you up close.”

Immediately, Will thought back to events prior to his entering Oza’s office. There was no way he would have missed any other participants. Of course, that was assuming everything he saw was real. The mentalist had the powers to change reality on a whim.

“Who knows, she might even fall for you. The mentalist has always had a thing for rogues. I’ll have my coffee now.”

Will looked at the small table. This was clearly another power play, and all he could do was go along with it. We went to the table and took one of the cups. In the past, the pain would have caused him to instantly let him go. Thanks to a number of endurance skills, the boy was able to carry it all the way to Oza’s desk and place it carefully in front of her.

“What more can you tell me about her?”

“Tell you?” The woman picked up the cup and took a sip. “I don’t have to tell you anything.”

“Not for free.”

“Boy, there’s nothing you can possibly offer.”

“I have clairvoyant skills,” Will said. It didn’t matter anyway, since she’d forget after he ended the prediction loop.

“I’m aware.” She took another sip. “How do you think I knew you were coming? The clairvoyant happens to be a very good friend of mine.”

*Rather, she has to be,* Will thought.

All the mental and physical damage predictions caused on a constant basis were pretty rough on the user. The clairvoyant would have to need healing on a constant basis, which meant that Oza could take advantage of her any way she liked. As long as she wasn’t obvious about it, there was no favor she couldn't demand in return.

“Then why see me at all?”

“You’re a new player. A rising star, some say. It’s always good business to get to know people early. It’s only a matter of time before you require my services.”

“Didn’t you just say that I don’t have anything to offer?”

“You’re mixing things up. There’s nothing you can offer, but there’s a lot that I can ask. Do you think that the idiots protecting me are doing so of their free will?” The woman snorted. “They know that if they piss me off, they’ll go on top of my shit list. And with the reward phase coming, that’s not something they can afford.”

“You’re participating?”

“I’m not an idiot.” The woman frowned and then looked at her phone. “Since you have a few minutes left, I might give you some free advice. Not that you’ll take it.”

Oza took another sip of her coffee, then placed the cup on her desk and took a puff of her vaper.

“Stay out of it,” she said. “You don’t have the chops to make it to the reward phase, so don’t even try.”

Will didn’t say a word, but the answer was plastered all over his face.

“I knew you’d react like this.” The woman turned to her monitor. “You can go now. I have a lot to do and—”

“I have a sponsor,” Will interrupted.

The reaction was part lie, part spite, but it had the desired effect. For a fraction of a second, Oza tensed up, then redirected her attention back to the boy.

“I’ll make it to the reward phase,” Will continued, keeping the momentum. “I want to know what follows after.”

“After the reward phase?” For the first time, the woman had to venture a guess. All her preparations hadn’t prepared her for such a turn in the conversation.

“That, too. For now, I’d settle for after the start. Only ten participants reach it at a time, give or take. I need to narrow down the field.”

“So, you know about the wildcards.” Oza continued looking at him intently to the point that Will wondered whether she didn’t have some kind of eye as well. “And what’s your offer?”

“What’s your price?” he asked. The boy was smart enough to know that she wouldn’t hand over anything for free. Being in a prediction loop tipped the scales in his favor way too much.

“As I told you, there’s nothing you can give me. If you get to the reward stage, things might change.”

An obvious Catch-22. In order to pay her price, Will had to reach the reward phase on his own, in which case he would no longer need her help. In all honesty, he didn’t know what her help would result in. What he really needed was to find the location of her mirror and claim her class for his own. Everything else was, to a large extent, misdirects and bullshit.

“In other words, no deal.”

“No *deal* this reward phase,” Oza clarified. “If you’re capable as you believe you won’t have trouble reaching it again. Consider it proof you’re serious.”

*Yeah, right.* “I’m listening.”

“A fragment strap,” she said. “You can only buy them from reward merchants.”

“What’s it do?”

“That’s something you’ll have to find out on your own. So, do we have a deal?”

“And what will you offer in exchange?”

“What you asked for: information.”

It was a bad deal, but it didn’t look like it would ever come to that.

“Don’t get any bright ideas, though. I’ll drip-feed you the information piece by piece. You can use all the prediction loops you like, and you still won’t get anywhere.”

“I know.” Will turned around.

“One last thing,” the woman said. “Can you turn to your left?”

The request was so strange that Will couldn’t help but comply. The moment he did, a spear shattered the massive window in front of him, piercing his head.

“Yeah, there are ways around everything if you’ve been doing this long enough.”

*That’s why you told me about her.* The goofball could have mentioned a dozen other participants, but he had chosen the cleric, just to give Will a taste of the real competition.

The real competition had to be way worse.

“Let’s take a walk,” Alex said. “I could use some fresh muffins.”

The two went to Spenser’s, where the goofball bought his daily ration of pastries. All the time Will remained silent. The experience was harsh, but it also was an indication of where he stood.

“Like I said, there’s a way for everything in eternity. I just don’t know it.” The goofball gave Will a pat on the head. “But hey, I’m not the rogue anymore. You’re the class that finds things out.”

1qmv3tr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMoneyGuy/comments/1qmv3tr/following_brian_and_bos_home_buying_rules_but/,"Following Brian and Bo's home buying rules, but does our math work?","Hey all,

  
Have listened to Brian and Bo for a little bit, but recently started taking the FOO seriously in the last 12 months or so (and I am so excited!!). My wife and I are looking into building a new home, but have not quite pulled the trigger on it.

In terms of the FOO, we are on step 4/5 depending on if we build this house or not. No high interest debt for either of us, just the remnants of our student loans which will be gone completely in 3 years for my wife and 5 years for me. We are 31 and 32.

We make a combined income of around 175k gross. I am in software engineering with a very stable non-tech industry company. I bring in 118 in gross. My wife is a teacher and brings in 57k gross. I generally average 4% raises on the years I don't get a promotion and my wife is union and has dedicated steps where her pay will increase every year for at least the next 5 years (63, 70, 77, 84, 91k according to the progressing on her step scale). I also bring in another 35-40k gross in bonuses every year that are paid out quarterly. For the 3 years I've been there the bonuses  have been (37,37,38) so they're consistent, but I don't count them as a part of our gross in order to be safe and conservative. I like to treat them as accelerators to our savings and goals instead.

The house we are looking to build would all in result in us taking on a mortgage of \~$420k after the down payment and closing costs.

The PITI would be $2,855 and includes P&I, property taxes, HOA, and there is no PMI on the loan so nothing added there.

Our emergency fund after closing would be about $25,000. I'd ideally like to get this up to $40,000 for some more secure buffer, but bonuses and savings will get us there before the end of the year.

Remaining debts are $35,000 in student loans for me (4.1% interest) and $8,000 for my wife (4.5%). We have thought of paying these off to clear up extra monthly cash but I know Brian and Bo have stated based on our age we shouldn't be paying down loans with interest that low in our 30s.

Retirement wise I have $75,000 in my 401k, $20k in company equity (I get extra every year). My wife has a pension that will pay her monthly as well as currently a $30,000 lump amount that grows every year. We're both getting our employer matches as well as extra on top.

Net we're bringing around $9,400 in per month. I've budgeted things out the following way using a net zero budget in Monarch:

* Mortgage - $2,855
* Utilities - $575 (Water, Sewer, Trash, Natural Gas, Electric, and Internet)
* Phones - $70
* Student Loans - $800
* Gym Membership - $30
* Car Insurance - $175

*(Fixed above - $4,505)*

  
Flexible:

* Gas - $350
* Parking and Tolls - $30
* Groceries - $600
* Restaurants and Bars - $300
* Coffee Shops - $35 (We don't drink much coffee out)
* Entertainment - $500
* Pets - $80
* Streaming Subscriptions - $100
* Clothing and Beauty - $300
* ATM Cash - $50
* Miscellaneous (A catch all to give buffer) - $500

*(Flex above - $2,845)*

  
Savings:

Sinking Funds:

* Gifts: $100
* Auto: $250 (Our cars are paid for, this is maintenance as well as future down payment savings)
* Home Improvement: $200
* Medical: $100 (Not insurance, that's paid for pre-tax)

*(Sinking Funds: $650)*  


Savings Funds:

* Repair Fund: $400
* Emergency Fund: $600 (Once Emergency Funds are full this would all go to Roth)
* Vacation Fund: $400

*(Funds: $1,400)*

*Total Savings: $2,050*

Balances out $9,400

  
I have tried to shoot high on things like utilities and food as well as give buffer for weird months in flexible spending so that the $2,050 we save is an absolute floor number. I think realistically most months it should be higher, not to mention the bonuses I receive.

Being that this is our first house and we have been planning this for some time, I wanted to reach out to other FOO followers to check my math. We've only ever rented and not owned so we just want to make sure we're making good choices and not going to be ""house poor""

1qmv2a5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qmv2a5,Albert 1er (*),"Had the opportunity to enjoy the 9 course menu at Albert 1er Restaurant while in Chamonix. It did not disappoint one bit. First time eating at a Michelin star restaurant. 

There wasn’t a wine pairing option, but we ordered few bottles, cocktails, and port wine. 

Long time enjoyer of foods, but never had interest or appeal in fine dining. This may have changed my entire outlook on fine dining and fixed courses. Easily top 2 meal of my life. Everything was literally perfect thickness, creaminess, texture, crunch to what you’d hope for. They some how knew what you wanted in a bite and made it happen. 

9 course menu that included several more items that weren’t listed on menu. I wasn’t able to pick up on all the items due to language barrier/not being able to speak French. 

Here is what we ate. Forewarning you’re going to get bit of very casual comparisons to what some items were like. Can also look at the menu for their descriptions of items. Sorry I didn’t do a  proper explanation of each dish or provide rating. If you’d like more info on specific dish, or items on the menu that I didn’t add photo feel free to ask!

1. Menu before we selected 7 course or 9 course option

2. Menu they give you at end of dinner

3. (Not listed on menu) Tart w/ buffalo cheese. Cheese was so creamy and light insight with same cheese in light crumble form on top (left), parsnip and coffee on top of almond biscuit with mushroom butter - this has the snap of similar to tempered chocolate (top), and puff pastry with candied smoke trout (bottom) - almost like a tortinos pizza roll with smoked trout inside and roe on top

4. (Not listed on menu) don’t think I wrote down what this one was. Hoping it wasn’t mixed in my notes for the first photo. It tasted similar to how it looks. Think it was finger potatoeswith crunchy bits similar to bacon bits and puff rice grains with a creamy like egg yolk emulsion. It was good, but maybe least interesting item on menu and that’s saying something  

5. (Start of menu) Veal's feet leek poached trout potato emulsion. 

6. Shaved slices of beet root with refined brown butter inside, crushed nuts on top, and ball of vinegar on side. This was unreal. 

7. Scallop with ginger teriyaki/soy sauce poured over with small dollops of citrus mayo, side of (not too pickled) pickled artichoke. We were instructed to alternate between cold and hot items. Some folks said this was the best dish. 

8. Salsify with poulette sauce

9. Salsify with Maison Aléna"" black truffle. Have always been worried about eating dishes with truffle. Think it’s overrated and throws off dish. This truffle wasn’t overpowering at all. Absolutely perfect. Let the salsify and sauce shine. 

10. Sous vide or poached (forgot which one) line caught seabass in a horseradish and turnip veloute with caramelized horseradish dollop and turnip. Photo doesn’t do the 2 sides/dollops of horseradish and turnip. The texture was perfect on literally everything. 

11. Alsatian venison loin w/ red cabbage and spiced crumble in a venison jus (infused with carvi - wild cumin) with caraway. Slice of apple on side. Perfectly cooked.

12. Cheese tray - we let server pick and choose the 2 plates we got. Mainly got goat cheese and Brie. Was hard to get list of all cheeses we got. I will say the best cheese I’ve ever had was on the plate. It was the Brie with a truffle and mascarpone middle. Unbelievable. There was also a 20 month Buffalo aged goat cheese that was very very good.  

13. Cheese

14. More cheese. This one includes mascarpone/truffle brie 

15. Citrus fruits and cottage cheese from our local Chamonix mountains. Below cottage cheese was grapefruit pieces, grapefruit rind pieces, some other citrus fruits, and marigold sorbet. Never knew cottage cheese could be this light and fluffy. 

16. Green Chartreuse Souffle w/ side of Grand Cru Mayan Red 70% Chocolate Sorbet (sorry didn’t include photo of chocolate sorbet)

17. Pouring chartreuse liquor into soufflé. Never had soufflé before and wow, just wow. Really loved how the chocolate wasn’t too sweet. Definitely leaned more on cocoa/unsweetened side. Let the chartreuse do the talking. We also tried the non dairy dessert and other chocolate dessert. The ND dessert equally matched, if not better, the soufflé. It was so refreshing. Kumquat was perfect

18. (Not listed on menu) Truffles: chocolate deca caramelized (top) and Black truffle with orange (bottom). Classic truffles. Not the biggest truffle person, but these beat out any truffle I’ve had. So consistent, not too overpowering. 

19. (Not listed on menu) last item. Didn’t write down what each item was, sorry! Left one was non dairy, and others were dairy. Both had a meringue, or meringue like base, with ND being açaí sorbet, and crushed like Rice Krispie cereal on top. Dairy version had perfect whipped cream with hydro beads of citrus with hint of cocoa and mint. Lovely palate cleanser  

20. Asked to see the kitchen, and they gladly let us. Unfortunately kitchen staff weren’t there anymore. ",7,1769374375.0,finedining,0,1.0,False

Im scared of them

Me n my gng were eating chupa chup belts...
We shared it with 2 other guys and those 2 sniffdogs who sit infront of us sniffed it and made a big deal out of it bc we didn't give them...sorry we didn't feel obligated to share it with u.
It was just one fucking strip, not a whole ass roll like hubba Bubba
They literally complained to the teacher that we were eating during class which resulted in an imposition...💀 like sheesh how petty can u be

That's not it, whenever we eat without feeding those starved dogs, they sabichufy us. ""Kudukama thingura la, Unaku dysentery dhan pogum""
Bruhh do i look like yo mom, it ain't my responsibility to feed yo ass

If they hear the opening of chips packet, they will literally leap on u and SNATCH IT😭 

A gurl bought biscuit with her pocket money
She got scared to death when they leapt on her
Ava kitarundhu pudungi gali pantanga pavam

One of those gurls asked meh how i pull all nighters
I recommended monster to her
Gurly brought the og one and didn't like it, she literally dumped it down the sink 
I said ""u might like other flavours""
The other day I was drinking it (the same og)
Moppa naai somehow smelled it
And asked for it
I reminded her that it's the one she didn't like
She said ""paravala kudu""
I half heartedly handed it over
Gurly drank it and said ""chi nallave illa""
Like what did u expect...
i really hate when ppl say chi to food...

During lunch, my friend was full and gave me the leftover omelette.
The sniffdog joined us Outta nowhere, demanded the omelette from me, saying ""En noodles ah yellarum vangi saptanga, enaku mutta Venum, thaa"" like I owed it to her or sth. Like since when was it my problem??? She could have refused, but decided to play mama bird and fed everyone, aww 😒

I wasn't willing to sacrifice it fully so I was cutting it in half
Bitch couldn't wait she was like ""seekaram tha"" ""enna pannitu iruka"" ""innum Evalo neram""

When I gave it to her she got disgusted cuz there was no yolk in it and threw it back in my lunchbox
Kinda disrespectful
I should have smacked her face with it when she was being impatient.

I really hate this bitch 
 I was drinking coffee and that bitch asked for it, i refused cuz I had only one sip left. Bitch got all petty again and didn't talk to me for weeks 💀
I was like finally I'm free

But it didn't last long...she started talking to me again
Help 

We have complimentary snacks in our canteen, those bitches finish round one, and pick ppl to go get more snacks for them
""Nee dhan vangala la, engaluku vangi tha""
Sorry but i ain't your butler bitch
Nan enaku vangave somberi thanam pattutu class la ye kedapen, ithula ivalunga vera 💀

2 other girls sit behind me, they call themselves husband and wife. They don't like sharing too, marachu vachu sapduvalunga
Enakum pudungi sapada pudikathu, so avalungala perusa kanduka maten
But I'm sitting infront of them, when I'm eating i can't hide it...they be like ""vittutu sapadra🥺""
Leave those 2 sniffdogs, i can't believe the audacity of these bitches. Like bruh u do it too
Neenga dhan purushan pondati ache, nakka vendiyathu dhana.

Another classmate of mine gagged after tasting my coffee cuz it was bitter. (Again, i hate when ppl say chi to food) I'm sorry for not dumping shit load of sugar in my coffee, i make it how I like it and drink it for caffeine.

I'm scared to eat and drink 
I literally bring 1 serving cuz I don't have time to cook for my whole class, it's not my duty either 
Irundhalum pudungi sapadranga😭

Honestly I'm waiting for this year to end, and never being in the presence of any sniffdogs again.

In a coffee shop with my LL wife. Shes stood in front of me in queue, I realise I left my wallet in the car, she says in a joking way ""fine. I guess I'll be paying then"". I put my arm around her waist, pulled her into me, kissed her on the neck and quietly said into her ear ""I'll make sure i pay you back later""

Her reply? ""why do you need to pay me back? its just coffee"" she wasn't even rejecting me, she didn't even pick up that I was flirting at all

For brief moment I completely forgot she has no sexual desire whatsoever, then it all came crashing back into me

1qmv0uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1qmv0uq/1_year_aeropress/,1 Year Aeropress,"Hey all! I wanted to let this forum know a new brewing recipe I recently tried with my aeropress. I stumbled across this by accident but with a little experimentation I think it will be one of the best brewing methods for the aeropress!

I recently prepped a nice afternoon cup, and while it was steeping I received a phone call. I forgot to pick up my kids from school! So I rushed out, forgetting that I left my brew steeping. 

On my way there, I got into a head on collision and blacked out. I woke up nearly 12 months later in the hospital, I received a large blow to the head and was in a coma. After I was discharged, my recently remarried wife drove me back home. 

Guess what was sitting on the counter, my aeropress! And it was still steeping! So I grabbed a mug, and press out the brew. I chucked it in the microwave and took a sip.

My god. The body on this brew had a presence unlike anything that has touched my tongue. The sweetness was like I was spooning straight Carmel into my mouth. The balance of bitterness and sourness was so perfect, I shed tears. After a few more sips, everything around me turned very bright and I felt all the pain in my body dissipate. 

Suddenly as the light faded, I was emerging from my mother’s womb. I was reborn, but I still retained all the knowledge of my life. I used this to excel myself, I did better in school, I didn’t let the love of my life slip away, I became wealthy and created a world of peace. As I layed on my deathbed, my large family surrounding me, I passed away peacefully.

Suddenly I awoke in my kitchen, realizing I’m holding a cup of moldy ass coffee that I just stuck in the microwave. I puked and took a long shower.

Hi, I’m looking to hire a barista for a private event for a shower in May for around 2 hours! I can provide all the equipment and ingredients needed (machine/dairy/syrups). It would most likely just be a breville machine that we can show how to use if needed. It’s very basic but just need a helper to make everything! Iced lattes/hot lattees. 

The machine would most likely be a breville barista express so very straightforward to operate. With simple instructions anyone could do it but I just prefer someone who’s somewhat comfortable making coffees! 

There is a bar at the venue that we’d most likely utilize a spot for serving!

Good morning/afternoon/evening/whenever this post may find you, and may it find you well! Title is cheesy, I know. But it's who I am, and I'm tired of feeling like I have to tone myself down in order to get into a relationship. I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text.

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are...

* 24-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this)
* Childfree (this means you neither have NOR want children) (non-negotiable)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous
* Cis AFAB woman. Very sorry to my AFAB enbies and trans girlies (and AMAB enbies and trans guys for that matter), love ya, I will always be an ally in the fight to be who you are without fear but y'all are just not for me romantically speaking.

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* Location (doesn't have to be precise but I'd at least like what state you're in currently)
* What about my post stood out to you and/or made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?

Just a bit (or a lot) of context, I’m a 34 year old Hispanic female and the first one in my family to be born in the US. The older I got, the more I understood why this was my curse. Growing up I was hated by some family members, especially my mother‘s sister. I honestly wasn’t a bad kid. I only spoke when spoken to and I never touched anything without asking for permission. Spanish households don’t believe in mental health or therapy just as much as the saying that men don’t cry. By 10 years old or so, I was going to the supermarket, cooking, babysitting, cleaning and laundry.

I didn’t have a daughter mother relationship with my mother. I could never confide in her, as I felt she resented me for reminding her so much of my father and their failed relationship. I also resented her for almost unaliving me at 15 when she found out I had a bf and cps got involved. Once I turned 18 and got a taste of freedom, I went with it! Drinking, partying and going on bingers. I no longer kept quiet to my mother’s comments of how I was worthless and a good for nothing. I defended myself, I finally felt empowered and like I had some control. But of course, this just added more fuel to our never ending list of problems.

My mom had this thing where she would exaggerate or twist the truth and I’ll never know if it was a mental health issue or if she liked the attention that came from it, but it made her family hate me even more. My mother even sided with them when I told her I was r\*ped by her sisters son. they all said I provoked it, mind you, I was 7 when it happened, 16 when I finally spoke out and instantly regretted it.

Fast forward to 2018, my mom got really sick. Years of not controlling her diabetes and high blood pressure -just to name a couple- finally caught up to her. A 30 day supply of medication would last her months because she refused to take it. She never watched what she ate, and every night she’d eat junk food with soda, juice or coffee. The only time she’d have a sip of water was every few weeks with her meds, other than that she refused. In 2018, she had 2 strokes, one month apart. Because of that, she had early onset dementia. All of a sudden, I became her mother.

In the beginning it wasn’t as difficult but it started progressing quickly. She refused to wear clothes, had to wear a diaper and I was the only one helping her with bathing, etc. I’ve heard horror stories and we had one bad experience with an assisted living, so that was not an option. I forgot to mention, I’m an only child, so I was truly alone and had just recently broken up my boyfriend of a few years who was a hero\*n addict.

I was waking up early to make her breakfast, feed her and give her medicine, but dealing with a 58 year old toddler was not an easy task. Everything was no and at times I lost my patience. I raised my voice a few times because she was non compliant. I couldn’t make her understand that it was for her own good. I worked a 3 minute drive away, so I’d go home for lunch to feed her. During my work hours, I watched her through our home cameras. She had two friends who would keep her company by alternating days from 11am until I came home for lunch. So my mother really only spent an hour or so alone and she’d watch TV or talk on the phone. She did have moments of clarity, so it wasn’t horrible, but not an easy task either.

Well, remember how I said my mom liked twisting the truth? It didn’t stop with the dementia. Me raising my voice at her or being strict about her eating was something she considered ab\*se and she wasted no time in sharing it with ALL her family. I was emotionally, physically and mentally drained. So much so that I lost 20lbs before things got worse. Even with all the sacrifices I was making, I still wasn’t enough; I was the villain. Her family started saying I was purposely letting her di\* so that I could keep her money, that it’s all I had ever wanted according to them (her savings were probably about 15k). Out of anger and frustration, I agreed with them and said I wanted her gone; I was exhausted. They said they could do a better job of taking care of her by putting her in a home, so I said you’re more than welcome to come get her and fly her across the country if you get approval from all her doctors so I started listing them, all I got was silence.

November 2018 she had her third stroke, which left her unable to walk or talk, but she could see and nod to communicate. Mid December 2018, I quit working to be able to spend the day with her at the hospital as she wasn’t getting any better, there wasn’t much remote work for me to do but I was still able to get a few hours and with my pto, I managed. New Year’s Eve 2018, she coded while I was getting ready to go see her, and she was brought back but she could no longer see. From that moment on until her passing on Jan 22nd, 2019, I stayed at the hospital pretty much 24/7. I would leave once a week to go home and grab clean clothes and take a quick hot shower since I could only take cold showers at the hospital (her room had no running hot water & it was wintertime), buy canned food and back to the hospital. At that point I no longer had any income, but God provided. A coworker had accrued 2 weeks of pto which he gave to me, and when my friends would come visit, they’d bring me money or food without me ever asking. I slept on a recliner for 3 weeks, just me and my mother in a room that had no space to even walk. I know nurses & specialists couldn’t be there caring for her every minute, so I’d change her, bathe her and change her trach when her vitals would decrease due to lack of oxygen.

Well, she passed away and of course everyone made it about them. I was not allowed to grieve, cry or even have an opinion, nothing I said mattered.  These people lost an aunt, a sister, a cousin, but I was the one that lost her mother that day. No one knew the pain that I was going through, but yet, they constantly told me to leave them alone because they were hurting every time I wanted something done a certain way for her funeral. I allowed them to visit her at the hospital because I know that’s what she wanted so I put my feelings aside. I specifically asked them not to take pictures of her because of how she looked, but they still did so. At the viewing, I asked them not to take pictures of her in the casket since I put pictures of her all over the funeral home, which they could take home with them, yet they still did it. They even told me in front of her casket that they could no longer stand the site of me, I kept quiet. My mom wanted to be buried in her home country next to her mother, but that’s not what her sisters wanted. So now my mother is buried somewhere where no one goes to visit her or bring her flowers and I am thousands of miles away. Her sister also decided shortly after her burial to have her moved, illegally, in the middle of the night, to a different grave without telling me.

The day my mom passed was the day that I erased her family from my life. I didn’t say anything to them. I just left. They haven’t bothered reaching out to me either to see how I’m doing. I posted a picture of her on social media shortly after her passing and one of them decided to say that my guilt was eating me up that’s why I couldn’t let her go. I blocked them all. I forgave them without ever receiving an apology. I know what they still think about me and personally, I do not care, that was until a few days ago. After six years of no contact, one of them messaged me asking me why I did that to my mother. I blew up. I told them how much I despised them. How they’re the most vile human beings despite calling themselves Christians. I think it’s been made clear how much I dislike them. For almost 7 years I have felt guilt for the way I was towards my mother. How much more I could’ve done for her but at the time I did the best that I could. I am now on anxiety medication and I know if I had been on it while all of this was happening with her, I could’ve been more nurturing, more gentle. So yes, for years I have carried this guilt on my back and having to hear it once again from her family has brought back so many emotions and regrets.

So, if you made it this far, thank you and please give me the harsh truth, was I a complete a-hole towards my mother? Am I as bad as everyone makes me out to be? Trust me, nothing you say can hurt me more than what’s already been said to me before.

Oh, and by the way, my mother’s savings remain untouched.",5,1769374015.0,TwoHotTakes,6,1.0,False

Last Pick: **Lakers ML -10U**

Today's Pick: O 2.5 TO(s)

**$DKNG**: -115

Wager Amount: 1.15U to WIN 1U

League: Los Angeles Rams vs Seattle Seahawks (5:30PM CST on FOX)

**Recap**: I took couple days off after a historical nite of losing 10 parlays by 1-leg each and losing a big bet on the POTD. I made all the wrong moves yesterday. Cashed out one the lays that would have covered my losses and loss out big on straight bet just on the Lakers to win and to top that off wit 10 parlays ALL losing by 1-leg (not to mention that 4 plays got hooked as well). 

But I bounced back nicely the other and yesterday! Had a great read on the UFC card and went 4-1! Had time to research but did not have time to put in a POTD writeup and that's really unfortunate because I was supremely confident in the Sean O'Malley play (which was plus money). To recap on the last POTD and other POTD considerations here's how it looked. 

**Reed Sheppard 3+ Threes (+155)✅+1.55U**

**Stephon Castle 8+ Asts (+120)✅+1.2U**

**Luka Doncic 50+ PAR (-119) ✅+1U**

**Lakers ML (-108) ❌-10U**

**Matchup:** I'm very convicted on who wins this game, but I'm not going to feature that ML play for today's POTD rather I will be taking this game prop of O 2.5 TO(s) in this NFC Championship game. Both defense are really great and they are defitnely capable of forcing turnovers. **The Rams has forced 26 TOs, which is the 3rd most in the league and Seahawks has 18 INTs this season, which is 5th most in the league (Rams has 16 INTs)**. What I really like about this wager is that Rams defense really match up well against the Seahawks offense. 

**The hawks had the most fumbles this season (26 fumbles) and Sam Darnold leads the league in most fumble as a starting quarterback (tied 11 fumbles** wit Baker Mayfield and Cam Ward), certainly not a stat you would like to have but he's got great offensive stats as well. He loves favoring his target to the #1 receiver. He's done that consistently wit Jufferson when he was a Vike and he's doing it now wit JSN as a Hawk. I acknowledge that Darnold has been lights out for most part of this season, but he **has had shown some vulnerabilities when he takes a lot of time in the pocket and that does not suit well against this Rams defense. This defense loves to pressure the o-line and that's why they have so much success against Darnold in the past. Darnold had multiple interceptions in each of the regular season matchup this year (2 INTs last game and 4 INTs in their first matchup)**. Darnold is also carrying a injury (oblique) and he hasn't really flashed like his previous games. IMO Darnold and JSN didn't do much in the last game, it was all the Seahawks defense that won and Darnold hasn't really flashed in his previous 3 games. He didn't have a single passing TD against the depleted Niners defense few weeks ago and just 1 passing TD again against this depleted Niners defense. I promise you that game would look a lot different if Nick Bosa and Fred Warner were playing. This Rams defense has Darnold's number despite that he finally won a game against them, the secondary has been feasting on his passes. I expect at least 1 INT against Darnold today. So it's obvious who I am taking to win this game (and taking the super bowl winner)

And do I really have to explain about the Seahawks defense? This should smack! 3 TO(s) is not a lot and I love PK price on it! Plus, there's been 3+ TO(s) in the previous 2 regular season matchup.

**The Play & Prediction :** 1.15U on O 2.5 TO(s) and also wagering 0.5U on Sam Darnold 2+ INTs. Darnold fumbles, throw 2 INTs and Rams also fumbles.

There's nothing here you could do, think, feel uniquely, and everything that exists is tied to opening you up into the secret society that controls everyone and everything here.. and everything here will lead to the same 'exit'. 💀

Humans are Illuminati generated concepts, and there aren't any 'real' countries/places/person that exists 'here.' and the more you end on discovering the 'truth', the more you'll end up on figuring that it's 'all' you're own doing lol.

It's an 'AI' generated reality, and everything that exists in it is an automated process that will lead you into being part of the 'illuminati' in the end, and as long as you live in 'society'/solar system, there's no changing that fact, and you are a part of the fire that keeps on growing here. 🧠🤓

heres the recipe::

1000g bread flour

700g spring water

100g yeast

50g salt

now i thought ""oops thats not  a brioche recipe"" then thought hey ill just continue with it and see how it turns out.

1qmuph4,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1qmuph4/my_appetite_and_inability_to_lose_weight_are/,My appetite and inability to lose weight are starting to seriously affect my mental health,"Have you ever been tired, but you try to sleep and instead you just lay wide awake because you're tired but your body refuses to let you sleep? Or been walking on a super windy day and the resistance makes it feel like you're climbing up a giant mountain while just walking?


I swear this is how I feel everyday. I don't know whats wrong with me. All I think about is food. And eating. I eat way more than I need to. And I tend to binge eat at night.


I have so much hunger that I genuinely want to cry. Like it's almost painful. Because it feels like a disconnect between my body and brain and I feel like I'm fighting this hunger so hard and I really don't think it's supposed to be like this.


Today I've spent about 3 hours walking (because when I'm home, I eat). I've chewed 4 pieces of gum. I've had 3 coffees and close to 100oz of water. It is 4pm. I've already eaten 1500 calories (3 cups of beans, 2 eggs, and cheese, plus 3(!!) scoops of protein powder with milk, pb2, flax seeds, and oreo crumbs).


I don't know how I'm supposed to make it through the rest of the day. I still feel so hungry, and the hunger is making it impossible to focus on anything else. I already know I won't make it through the day without eating at minimum maintenance. In the past several months, I've only gained weight. Not lost anything.


It's extremely depressing, especially since I'm already unhappy with my body, already hungry, and as hard as I can try I can't eat less.


What's wrong with me??

*“19th of October, 1885” The blank page was occupied solely by this singular piece of rather untidy handwriting placed at the top right corner. What would follow remained a mystery, even for the hands supposedly recounting events and noting emotions. Not from the lack of meaningful points to elaborate on, but rather the opposite.*

*Having sunk into the realm of her thoughts, Zofia would take her eyes off the notebook resting on her lap and gaze outside, at the rows upon rows of trees making up deep, uncharted forests she was passing by. Her head leaned against the window, feeling vibrations emanating from the train, getting lost in the clutter of its countless wheels. Ah, so many uncertainties, so many doubts. She felt the weight of her family’s issues on her shoulders, even if only partially.*

*“Maybe it’s not going to be that bad?” She thought to herself, glancing for a moment at an old suitcase she placed beside herself. “But when will I get to see them again? In months?” A sigh followed, a futile attempt at dispersing worries. Soon enough her new life would begin, yet what will it bring?*

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

**Greetings, everyone!**

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking for someone to GM this story, I’ll contribute as much as you wish. Be it brainstorming, playing some side characters, you name it. As someone who knows how it is to GM, I wish for you to enjoy the roleplay as well (＾-＾)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

(I'd also be open to a similar roleplay inspired by ""Bride's story"" :3)

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

**About me:**

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Why hello! I shall introduce myself a bit, so that you also know who you’re dealing with. You may call me Frog. I’m a passionate, 18+ roleplayer from CET/GMT +1 timezone. However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don’t be deterred by that even if you’re from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don’t have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that’s worth a mention!

The [X4Y] tag does reflect the gender of my characters, not my own. I prefer not sharing it. I hope you’ll understand <3

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

**About you:**

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

Here you’ll find a few requirements, so that we are sure we match.
- *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I’ve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic ^^* 
- *Be creative! Cheesy, I know, but hey, I don’t want to be the only one coming up with the ideas. This premise has so much potential for unique and intriguing tales, let’s brainstorm them together!*
- *Be excited! Yeah, another cheesy one. Yet, I find it so fun to see an enthusiastic reply!*

Were we insensitive? This happened in August 2024. I am sorry this is long. All names are fake.

To this day LL (31F - the ex friend) accuses me (37F) of being “a garbage human”. I have her cell blocked. She has contacted me multiple times through email calling me all kinds of things and accusing me of even more things. She tried to turn our friend (Turtle 39M) against us after all of this and had another friend of hers email me, calling me awful as well. That’s another story.

This info is important: 3 weeks prior to this conversation our beautiful dog Arya, passed away in an unexpected and traumatic event. We rushed Arya to a vet. Arya never made it, she died in my arms. LL came by that evening for about 30 mins after we got back from the vet. LL brought us some food and coffee. We were still in shock. I still cry for that dog. I miss her so much.

We never agreed to help LL move anything. In fact, there is a text conversation of us saying no. The last 4 pages of text messages are after a few days had passed from the first conversation and TW (37M) and I were back from a weekend away. We needed it as we had not had any weekend to ourselves away from LL since Arya had passed and we needed a break from LL. We never “disappeared” as she stated. We said we would be out of cell service before we left.

The 4th person in this group chat is Turtle (M39). My partner TW and I have been friends with Turtle for over 2 decades. Turtle and LL have been talking and slept together the year prior when Turtle had visited us. LL still wanted a relationship with Turtle and she was talking to him behind her husband’s (Jon 38M) back. Jon and LL were always on and off. She constantly talked about how Jon has ruined her life and she hates him. I did not like Jon from what LL had told me about him. Jon and LL have 3 young children.

Jon and LL were on at this point and moving to a new rental together. Turtle lives in a different province and just wanted to be friends with LL. Jon and LL had been living together for the past year. I’m sure LL didn’t want Turtle knowing Jon was moving with her to the new place. Yes, Jon was there, moving to the new place with LL. I think LL was mad that the cat got out of the bag.W

We had 2 years of dropping everything and running to LL’s aid. If she said jump, we jumped. She could be very up and down and was dealing with a lot. We have helped her move at least 4 times in less than 2 years. Always there for her since she is estranged from most of her family (according to her they are toxic) and she doesn’t have many close friends. We were all she had besides Jon. We didn’t mind. We were friends and that’s what friends do. We spent a lot of time with LL and most of the time it was great.

The link at the beginning of this text message argument is an Andrew Tate reel where he is talking about how “everything is not what it seems” and then LL added “Sunscreen though” after she sent the reel because the weekend before I used sunscreen, like always. She said ""sunscreen causes cancer” for the 100th time as I was applying it to myself and I said “I use sunscreen because I don’t want to get skin cancer” and I think she took that as me implying she will get skin cancer. I never once said she would get cancer. I always had to defend myself with her.

She is very pro Trump, RFK, Joe Rogan, anti vax, feeds her kids raw milk, follows trad wife influencers and always brought up conspiracy theories and seriously believed them. To be completely honest, it would get on my nerves but she seemed to be coming around to reality from spending time with us and not her abusive Joe Rogan obsessed husband.

When she would accuse us of saying/doing things I would always ask her when, where, who said it but she would always change the subject.

So much on the diet I don't get to eat. Bacon and breakfast sausage is out.  So much food with lots of fat and sodium. I read the labels on foods I buy. So much in them not good for us. I feel so down. That so much I like to eat is not exactly DASH friendly.  Went out to breakfast today with my regular church choir group after church.  I ordered a garden frittata.  Which was ok.  Ate half of it and brought half home.  Told them the hashbrowns please tell the cooks no salt.  At half the hashbrowns. They were a bit greasy.  When I brought half my breakfast home.  I put the hashbrowns on a regular paper plate and then in a container. I figured the paper plate will soak up the oil. I don't like wasting food. Ordered the Frittata so there could be a little left for another meal.  Ate wheat toast for my toast with no jelly.  Coffee is technically a no no when working on lowering your bp. I have one cup in the mornings most days. Only when the choir group eats breakfast out. I'll have more. I was looking that menus on a DASH link. Trying to menu plan. I had a Noom membership that since expired. Which only taught me portion control. I didn't renew it.  It is expensive. It seems Noom is pushing people to do the diet drugs. Something I'm not interested in at this time. I also have a lot of weight to loose at 216 now for age 63.  ,8,1769373035.0,DashDiet,3,1.0,False

(the school i went to was way too expensive so im doing this to save both me & my parents money). i found this new job like a day after making my decision to take a gap semester. it’s my favorite coffee shop in town and ive grown up going here. the staff already knew me as a customer before i joined the team. 

i got hired last week and started tuesday, where i was immediately put to work in an 8 hour shift. i was only paid for 7 of those hours. i also don’t even make minimum wage. (the argument is that tips will count as minimum wage). i also learned that we don’t get breaks. there’s also no seating for employees so i was on my feet nonstop working the whole shift. and then there is EXTENSIVE cleaning/restocking physical labor after closing. i’ve been a barista before, and my past experience was nothing like this. it was kinda crappy, but not in this way. 

i wanna list some of the things that are done here that are red flags to me: 

\- below minimum wage 

\- no break/food allowed 

\- must have completely schedule availability that changes every week (from 6am-9pm every single day)

\- cannot call out sick without documented medical proof even if just for one shift 

\- must give minimum 3 week notice if you need a day off (weekly schedules don’t come out until saturday evenings) 

\- the owner takes a % of your paycheck and pockets it 

\- most new hires have quit very shortly after getting brought in. the only constant in the staff are the long term employees who have been there 4+ years

\- every coworker i’ve met has told me the owner is a MONSTER and that this job is hell

am i crazy or is this a valid reason to quit? i’ve only been here a week but i cried multiple times post-closing last night from physical exhaustion. closing duties took so long that i had to stay 2 hours after my shift ended unpaid to complete them. i’ve also been berated countless times by customers which obviously is a part of the service industry experience, but ive had many jobs in this industry and have never been treated as awfully as i have here. 

my parents do not support this decision at all. they don’t care that what’s happening here, to the best of my knowledge, seems to be against state law and just keep calling me a quitter. am i valid for leaving? i plan on texting my boss tonight and letting him know that i wont be working here anymore.

In the real world, things take time.

If you ask a friend for a coffee, you don’t stand perfectly still and stop breathing until the coffee arrives. You keep living your life until it’s ready.

That’s asynchronous programming.

1.	The core mental model: The Pager

Imagine you go to a busy burger joint. They don’t make you stand at the counter while they cook. They give you a pager (a Promise).

Pending: The burger is being cooked. The pager is quiet.

Resolved: The burger is ready. The pager buzzes. You trade the pager for the burger.

Rejected: They ran out of meat. The pager buzzes red. You get an apology instead of a burger.

A Promise is not the burger. It’s the pager.

2.	Why vibe coders get stuck: “Ghost Data”

The common mistake is trying to use the data before it has buzzed.

You ask the AI: “Fetch the user profile and show the name.”

The screen shows: “Hello, undefined.”

Not because the database is empty.

Because your UI tried to read the name while the pager was still Pending.

This is the real Day 5 skill: keeping your UI in sync with state transitions.

3.	The modern solution: async / await

Today we use two keywords to make async code readable:

async: tells the computer “this function involves waiting.”

await: tells the computer “pause here until the pager buzzes.”

The point is not prettier syntax.

The point is correct timing.

4.	Practice prompts

Prompt A (Timing test)

“Explain why my code says ‘User is undefined’ even though the data exists. Where am I reading state too early? Show how await changes the order of events.”

Prompt B (UI expert)

“I’m fetching a large list of images. How do I show a Loading state while the Promise is Pending, then render the UI when it’s Resolved?”

Prompt C (Error handler)

“What happens if an awaited request gets a 500 error? Show how try/catch handles a rejected Promise so the UI doesn’t crash.”

Day 5 goal

By the end of today, the student should understand that fetching data isn’t instant.

They should be able to spot a race condition (using data before it arrives), and explain how await plus a loading state keeps the app honest.

1qmuabt,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/1qmuabt/is_this_considered_a_gift_or_a_loan_when_there/,Is this considered a gift or a loan when there was no agreement to repay?,"Hello, I’m looking for guidance on whether I am legally obligated to repay money that was sent to me almost a year and a half ago when there was no agreement that it was a loan.

At the time, I was off work and on EI due to workplace sexual harassment. During that period, a colleague from another location (not my direct coworker) was emotionally supportive. We spoke often and met for coffee a few times.

She offered to send me one month of rent money ($1,000). I told her I was uncomfortable accepting money and did not want it. She sent it anyway via e-transfer, which auto-deposited into my account.

After she sent it, I texted her saying that I did not feel comfortable taking the money but appreciated the gesture.

The only discussion about repayment happened over the phone after she had already sent the money. During that call, when I asked what repayment would look like, she told me not to worry about repayment, not to think about it right now, and to just focus on getting better. This conversation is not in writing.

There was no written discussion of repayment, no repayment plan, no written agreement, and no mention of this being a loan.

Because my bank account was overdrawn at the time, the deposit was absorbed into the negative balance and I did not immediately send it back. I wish I had though. 

Almost a year and a half later, she began sending messages demanding repayment. In those messages, she told me that I need to sell my car. She also told me that she has had to go to Great Clips instead of her usual salon because of this situation. She sent me multiple long text threads about how hard her circumstances are now that's she off work due to sickness.

Under stress and guilt, I have repaid $400 so far. I also sent messages offering to try to pay $50/month, even though I am still in significant financial difficulty (multiple moves, selling most of my belongings, sleeping in my car at times, and going through a divorce with someone who has made my life more difficult to name a few).

There was never any agreement that this money was a loan, and the only written messages from the time it was sent show me expressing discomfort about accepting it.

My questions are:

In a situation like this, would this legally be viewed as a gift rather than a loan?

Does the fact that I have repaid $400 and offered small payments change the legal interpretation?

If she attempted small claims court, how would this likely be viewed given there was no agreement to repay?

Should I continue attempting payments without knowing whether I am legally obligated?

Are the later messages telling me to sell my car and mentioning Great Clips relevant in any way?

Thank you for any guidance.

Edit: I also want to clarify that I do not know this woman very well. It was a coworker at my branch who connected me to this woman via email, and so I do not work directly with this woman that sent me the money. I've
 only spoken to her a handful of times during that moment in my life. 

Also, the last time I had sent her money she responded by sending what came across as a very manipulative message in which she is telling me again how hard her life is financially at the moment... But I am in the same boat, hence the inability to pay her back. ",0,1769372651.0,legaladvicecanada,5,0.29,False

**Timeline**

We’ve been talking almost a year and dating about 10 months. For most of that time, we saw each other about twice a month, sometimes every two to three weeks. Recently, about the last month, we’ve naturally shifted to seeing each other once a week.

**Physical and emotional dynamic**

Sex is not a driver of the connection. We’ve been physically intimate about four times total. Even when we spend the night together, it’s mostly cuddling, watching shows, walking, coffee, and being present. He doesn’t push sex and seems comfortable with emotional closeness.

**October conversation**

I asked how he felt about our connection and whether it was casual. He didn’t answer yes or no, but said the connection makes him happy. He also said I felt a bit guarded, which he explained was because he hadn’t been to my place yet. He mentioned that meeting friends would make sense at some point and that he wanted to see where I lived.

**December shift**

He came to my place for the first time and spent a full day with me. After that, we started seeing each other more consistently. We had a deep conversation about our pasts, values, relationship preferences, and family. That conversation made me feel especially close to him.

**Future hints**

During December conversations, he mentioned his mom asking about me, which showed me he talks about me to his family. In a separate, practical conversation about housing, I shared that I plan to look seriously for my own place around 2027. In response, he mentioned his family owns property in the city and alluded to the idea of living together someday. It wasn’t framed as a plan, but it also wasn’t random.

**Current situation**

We continue to spend quality time together. We recently spent the night together, cuddled, watched shows, walked in the snow, and had coffee the next morning. It feels calm, safe, and affectionate. He initiates time together and follows through.

**What I’m unsure about**

I usually initiate deeper reflective conversations about how we connect emotionally. He engages when they happen, but doesn’t initiate them himself. I bond strongly through those conversations and don’t want to assume he bonds the same way. We haven’t met friends or family yet, even though it’s been mentioned in the past.

Nothing feels bad or unsafe. I enjoy him and feel respected. It just feels steady without much verbal clarity or direction.

Curious how others would interpret this. Normal slow burn? Different bonding styles? Or a situation that needs a clearer conversation?

1qmu84t,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentSecrets/comments/1qmu84t/study_smarter_not_harder/,Study Smarter Not Harder,"Do you ever feel like your study habits simply aren’t cutting it? Do you wonder what you could be doing to perform better in class and on exams? Many students realize that their high school study habits aren’t very effective in college. This is understandable, as college is quite different from high school. The professors are less personally involved, classes are bigger, exams are worth more, reading is more intense, and classes are much more rigorous. That doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you; it just means you need to learn some more effective study skills. Fortunately, there are many active, effective study strategies that are shown to be effective in college classes.

This handout offers several tips on effective studying. Implementing these tips into your regular study routine will help you to efficiently and effectively learn course material. Experiment with them and find some that work for you.

# Reading is not studying

Simply reading and re-reading texts or notes is not actively engaging in the material. It is simply re-reading your notes. Only ‘doing’ the readings for class is not studying. It is simply doing the reading for class. Re-reading leads to quick forgetting.

Think of reading as an important part of pre-studying, but learning information requires actively engaging in the material (Edwards, 2014). Active engagement is the process of constructing meaning from text that involves making connections to lectures, forming examples, and regulating your own learning (Davis, 2007). Active studying does not mean highlighting or underlining text, re-reading, or rote memorization. Though these activities may help to keep you engaged in the task, they are not considered active studying techniques and are weakly related to improved learning (Mackenzie, 1994).

Ideas for active studying include:

* Create a study guide by topic. Formulate questions and problems and write complete answers. Create your own quiz.
* Become a teacher. Say the information aloud in your own words as if you are the instructor and teaching the concepts to a class.
* Derive examples that relate to your own experiences.
* Create concept maps or diagrams that explain the material.
* Develop symbols that represent concepts.
* For non-technical classes (e.g., English, History, Psychology), figure out the big ideas so you can explain, contrast, and re-evaluate them.
* For technical classes, work the problems and explain the steps and why they work.
* Study in terms of question, evidence, and conclusion: What is the question posed by the instructor/author? What is the evidence that they present? What is the conclusion?

Organization and planning will help you to actively study for your courses. When studying for a test, organize your materials first and then begin your active reviewing by topic (Newport, 2007). Often professors provide subtopics on the syllabi. Use them as a guide to help organize your materials. For example, gather all of the materials for one topic (e.g., PowerPoint notes, text book notes, articles, homework, etc.) and put them together in a pile. Label each pile with the topic and study by topics.

# Understand the Study Cycle

The Study Cycle, developed by Frank Christ, breaks down the different parts of studying: previewing, attending class, reviewing, studying, and checking your understanding. Although each step may seem obvious at a glance, all too often students try to take shortcuts and miss opportunities for good learning. For example, you may skip a reading before class because the professor covers the same material in class; doing so misses a key opportunity to learn in different modes (reading and listening) and to benefit from the repetition and distributed practice (see #3 below) that you’ll get from both reading ahead *and* attending class. Understanding the importance of all stages of this cycle will help make sure you don’t miss opportunities to learn effectively.

# Spacing out is good

One of the most impactful learning strategies is “distributed practice”—spacing out your studying over several short periods of time over several days and weeks (Newport, 2007). The most effective practice is to work a short time on each class every day. The total amount of time spent studying will be the same (or less) than one or two marathon library sessions, but you will learn the information more deeply and retain much more for the long term—which will help get you an A on the final. The important thing is how you *use* your study time, not how *long* you study. Long study sessions lead to a lack of concentration and thus a lack of learning and retention.

In order to spread out studying over short periods of time across several days and weeks, you need control over your schedule. Keeping a list of tasks to complete on a daily basis will help you to include regular active studying sessions for each class. Try to do something for each class each day. Be specific and realistic regarding how long you plan to spend on each task—you should not have more tasks on your list than you can reasonably complete during the day.

For example, you may do a few problems per day in math rather than all of them the hour before class. In history, you can spend 15-20 minutes each day actively studying your class notes. Thus, your studying time may still be the same length, but rather than only preparing for one class, you will be preparing for all of your classes in short stretches. This will help focus, stay on top of your work, and retain information.

In addition to learning the material more deeply, spacing out your work helps stave off procrastination. Rather than having to face the dreaded project for four hours on Monday, you can face the dreaded project for 30 minutes each day. The shorter, more consistent time to work on a dreaded project is likely to be more acceptable and less likely to be delayed to the last minute. Finally, if you have to memorize material for class (names, dates, formulas), it is best to make flashcards for this material and review periodically throughout the day rather than one long, memorization session (Wissman and Rawson, 2012). 

# It’s good to be intense

Not all studying is equal. You will accomplish more if you study intensively. Intensive study sessions are short and will allow you to get work done with minimal wasted effort. Shorter, intensive study times are more effective than drawn out studying.

In fact, one of the most impactful study strategies is distributing studying over multiple sessions (Newport, 2007). Intensive study sessions can last 30 or 45-minute sessions and include active studying strategies. For example, self-testing is an active study strategy that improves the intensity of studying and efficiency of learning. However, planning to spend hours on end self-testing is likely to cause you to become distracted and lose your attention.

On the other hand, if you plan to quiz yourself on the course material for 45 minutes and then take a break, you are much more likely to maintain your attention and retain the information. Furthermore, the shorter, more intense sessions will likely put the pressure on that is needed to prevent procrastination.

# Silence isn’t golden

Know where you study best. The silence of a library may not be the best place for you. It’s important to consider what noise environment works best for you. You might find that you concentrate better with some background noise. Some people find that listening to classical music while studying helps them concentrate, while others find this highly distracting. The point is that the silence of the library may be just as distracting (or more) than the noise of a gymnasium. Thus, if silence is distracting, but you prefer to study in the library, try the first or second floors where there is more background ‘buzz.’

Keep in mind that active studying is rarely silent as it often requires saying the material aloud.

# Problems are your friend

Working and re-working problems is important for technical courses (e.g., math, economics). Be able to explain the steps of the problems and why they work.

In technical courses, it is usually more important to work problems than read the text (Newport, 2007). In class, write down in detail the practice problems demonstrated by the professor. Annotate each step and ask questions if you are confused. At the very least, record the question and the answer (even if you miss the steps).

When preparing for tests, put together a large list of problems from the course materials and lectures. Work the problems and explain the steps and why they work (Carrier, 2003).

# Reconsider multitasking

A significant amount of research indicates that multi-tasking does not improve efficiency and actually negatively affects results (Junco, 2012).

In order to study smarter, not harder, you will need to eliminate distractions during your study sessions. Social media, web browsing, game playing, texting, etc. will severely affect the intensity of your study sessions if you allow them! Research is clear that multi-tasking (e.g., responding to texts, while studying), increases the amount of time needed to learn material and decreases the quality of the learning (Junco, 2012).

Eliminating the distractions will allow you to fully engage during your study sessions. If you don’t need your computer for homework, then don’t use it. Use apps to help you set limits on the amount of time you can spend at certain sites during the day. Turn your phone off. Reward intensive studying with a social-media break (but make sure you time your break!) 

# Switch up your setting

Find several places to study in and around campus and change up your space if you find that it is no longer a working space for you.

Know when and where you study best. It may be that your focus at 10:00 PM. is not as sharp as at 10:00 AM. Perhaps you are more productive at a coffee shop with background noise, or in the study lounge in your residence hall. Perhaps when you study on your bed, you fall asleep.

Have a variety of places in and around campus that are good study environments for you. That way wherever you are, you can find your perfect study spot. After a while, you might find that your spot is too comfortable and no longer is a good place to study, so it’s time to hop to a new spot!

# Become a teacher

Try to explain the material in your own words, as if you are the teacher. You can do this in a study group, with a study partner, or on your own. Saying the material aloud will point out where you are confused and need more information and will help you retain the information. As you are explaining the material, use examples and make connections between concepts (just as a teacher does). It is okay (even encouraged) to do this with your notes in your hands. At first you may need to rely on your notes to explain the material, but eventually you’ll be able to teach it without your notes.

Creating a quiz for yourself will help you to think like your professor. What does your professor want you to know? Quizzing yourself is a highly effective study technique. Make a study guide and carry it with you so you can review the questions and answers periodically throughout the day and across several days. Identify the questions that you don’t know and quiz yourself on only those questions. Say your answers aloud. This will help you to retain the information and make corrections where they are needed. For technical courses, do the sample problems and explain how you got from the question to the answer. Re-do the problems that give you trouble. Learning the material in this way actively engages your brain and will significantly improve your memory (Craik, 1975).

# Take control of your calendar

Controlling your schedule and your distractions will help you to accomplish your goals.

If you are in control of your calendar, you will be able to complete your assignments and stay on top of your coursework. The following are steps to getting control of your calendar:

1. On the same day each week, (perhaps Sunday nights or Saturday mornings) plan out your schedule for the week.
2. Go through each class and write down what you’d like to get completed for each class that week.
3. Look at your calendar and determine how many hours you have to complete your work.
4. Determine whether your list can be completed in the amount of time that you have available. (You may want to put the amount of time expected to complete each assignment.) Make adjustments as needed. For example, if you find that it will take more hours to complete your work than you have available, you will likely need to triage your readings. Completing all of the readings is a luxury. You will need to make decisions about your readings based on what is covered in class. You should read and take notes on all of the assignments from the favored class source (the one that is used a lot in the class). This may be the textbook or a reading that directly addresses the topic for the day. You can likely skim supplemental readings.
5. Pencil into your calendar when you plan to get assignments completed.
6. Before going to bed each night, make your plan for the next day. Waking up with a plan will make you more productive.



# Use downtime to your advantage

Beware of ‘easy’ weeks. This is the calm before the storm. Lighter work weeks are a great time to get ahead on work or to start long projects. Use the extra hours to get ahead on assignments or start big projects or papers. You should plan to work on every class every week even if you don’t have anything due. In fact, it is preferable to do some work for each of your classes every day. Spending 30 minutes per class each day will add up to three hours per week, but spreading this time out over six days is more effective than cramming it all in during one long three-hour session. If you have completed all of the work for a particular class, then use the 30 minutes to get ahead or start a longer project.",1,1769372518.0,StudentSecrets,0,1.0,False

But here we are, our first is 6 mo old and nothing is the way I thought it would be. I don’t have any other burdens besides watching my baby, I’m staying at home and don’t have to worry about work or financial part of it, and yet I barely have any energy to do anything. Intimacy is literally the last thing I want. I’m uncomfortable in my own skin. I can’t clean and cook the way I want to. The baby is fed clean and happy, but besides that very few things are the way I imagined would be. The bay doesn’t sleep through the night and I’m the only one watching the baby 24/7, it’s literally waking up every single hour at night right now also… I don’t know the cause, probably combination of teething and solids or whatever. But even if the baby slept through the night, I find it extremely uncomfortable to do anything. I have to carry the baby around 24/7, I have to cook with one hand if I’m able to, I have to clean with one hand, because baby is constantly with me. I’m so used to being alone, I find myself drained by the evening solely from the amount of interaction I need to have with the baby, i have to check on the baby, feed it, clean it make sure it’s happy and entertained all the time… by the end of the day I don’t want to do anything I once loved. I’m extremely happy the baby is happy and healthy, this is all I ever was worried about, but I don’t understand how is it possible to find joy and peace especially have multiple kids. Besides that my husband is extremely supportive, he finds time to calm me down every time I have some meltdown, patiently, he doesn’t demand anything from me like he is just there happy to have a loaf of bread with coffee, doesn’t get upset if I don’t have time to do anything extra besides the baby, but I just .. I never thought I would be like this I thought I could do everything, and I’m barely able to do 1/10 of what I truly want. I see all those influencers wearing makeup nice cloth have enough time to film a video with 7 kids… but like how??? I was having hard time even trying to put up Christmas decorations, I literally have to guard every single day sleep my baby’s has so he doesn’t roll and doesn’t wake himself up unintentionally, like how in the world people do … family you know?? I can’t imagine how would I be able to care about another baby if I got pregnant, like 325% of my time out of 100% that I thought I had is preoccupied with the baby already.

However, one of the major issue is privacy regarding the details to be put on the blockchain.

In order to solve this, concept of permissioned blockchain has come but still users are vary to join permissioned networks also and put their data on-chain for everyone to see

In order to resolve this, [HyperLog](https://www.hyperlog.net/) provides a feature while uploadin the block - the uploading user can encrypt the block before uploading it and decide which user and for what time can decrypt the block and view the data.

My husband and I are in our 30’s with a 3yo and 1yo. We used to live in Atlanta, but are getting tired of the traffic and want to move somewhere that feels a bit safer + slower paced. 

What matters to us: 

\- Outdoorsy (hikes nearby) 

\- Walkable to coffee, restaurants, yoga (etc.). A 5 minute drive instead of walk would be fine too if there are good walk/bike paths nearby. 

\- Kid friendly (nice playgrounds, coffee spots you can chill with kids, places they can run around) 

\- Schools. This is where it gets tricky. We ideally want the kids in a limited hours per week school up until age 9 or 10 (Montessori, nature school, etc.). We want the option for them to play more than being in a seat all day. However, we don’t plan to homeschool them long term and do want good school zones. Preferably public, private would be ok for a max of $10K per year. 

We thought a lot about Signal Mountain, but have read several posts stating it gets boring/isolated. 

We both work remote now, so job options aren’t a big priority. We are a very laid back family. It would be great if the city we end up in has some laid back, “be yourself” vibes similar to Decatur. Our favorite city we have visited so far has been Boise - we are looking for a similar city on the East Coast.
