1nm27rq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nm27rq,Mozelle's Upcoming Event - Plate Open Late - October 24th,"Hello¬†[r/Toledo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Toledo/)!

[Mozelle's](https://www.instagram.com/mozelles.botanical.treats/)¬†here again! We have posted in the past (check it out¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/toledo/comments/1l43nsb/5_course_vegan_dinner/)¬†and¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/toledo/comments/1lg7hft/5_course_vegan_dinner_follow_up/)) about local events that we were putting on with a small team of talented and lovely individuals from¬†[Plate 21](https://www.instagram.com/plate21/)¬†and¬†[Sprouted Event Design](https://www.instagram.com/sproutedeventdesign/).

We are pleased to announce our upcoming Plate Open Late! A full kitchen takeover and menu of scratch made treats both sweet and savory, a small collection of exceptional mocktails made with unusual and tasty components, a specially curated playlist, and a funky vibe!

Food will vary from being vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free, while also doing our best to be mindful of other allergens.

While a mocktail bar will be Mozelle's primary focus, alcoholic beverages will also be available, as Plate 21 will be offering beer, wine, and a seasonal sangria.

And of course Plate 21 will have their coffee bar open to offer their exceptional coffee and beverages provided by their talented team of baristas.

Please consider joining us for the evening! This is not a ticketed event like we have done in the past, this is just a casual night for people to walk in and enjoy their time together, or grab a few bites to go back and enjoy in the comfort of their home.

 If not this time, we are planning another Plate Open Late in December and looking forward to developing our next 5 course dinner which will be right around Valentines day.

1nm25qt,https://www.reddit.com/r/cofounderhunt/comments/1nm25qt/recommendation_for_good_affiliate_programs/,Recommendation for good affiliate programs,"I‚Äôm thinking of creating a website to promote products using affiliate links. I‚Äôve done some research on affiliate programs, specifically Rakuten, Temu, and Amazon. I‚Äôll write a few words about each so you understand why I‚Äôm asking here. :)

Rakuten:

Super cool, a wide variety of products and brands, easy to use and add products to your site. The big issue? They shut down accounts left and right, with money still in them, which you never see again. And most often without explanation, there are people who didn‚Äôt even break the terms. I had an account with them, started working on the site and adding products, and they closed my account with no explanation. Good thing I hadn‚Äôt started promoting anything yet. After looking into it, I found out what I just said, it‚Äôs a horror story. I‚Äôm amazed they‚Äôre still in business; they should be getting sued every day. So that‚Äôs a no, I don‚Äôt want to spend six months to earn $2,000 and then never see it.

Temu:

In short, they offer good commission payouts, but the problem is with the model they chose. A referral only qualifies if the person never had the Temu app installed, installs it through your link, and places an order within 30 days. In other words, if they visit your site and browse from their browser, tough luck. Same if they go through your link and buy the product but already have the app installed. Basically, the chances of making money with their affiliate program drop to near zero because a lot of people already have the app. So again, pass, waste of time.

Amazon Associates:

You‚Äôd think that because of the Amazon brand, this would be solid and profitable. Nothing could be further from the truth. Despite Amazon‚Äôs growing profits over the last 15 years, affiliate commissions have been steadily dropping since 2012. From what I‚Äôve read, you basically earn coffee money with how poorly they pay. Add to that the fact that an order must be placed within 24 hours after someone clicks your link, otherwise it doesn‚Äôt count so you can cross this one off too.

So, as you can see, I‚Äôm pretty disappointed, and it seems like it‚Äôs not really worth building a site, listing products, and investing in ads and promotion if there aren‚Äôt good affiliate programs out there. Do you have any recommendations that are at least somewhat decent? By that, I mean:

Cookies that last at least 14 days ‚Äî not everyone buys immediately after clicking your link

No need to pay huge commissions, but not peanuts like Amazon either

Don‚Äôt randomly close your account with money in it for no reason

(looking for recommendations)","I wasn't sure what to flair this as, because it's somewhere between food, entertainment, and nightlife, so I just tagged it as food since that's the main point of the post. I can always change it if requested! 

My husband and I are locals but don't get out much. This October we're celebrating our 3 year wedding anniversary and we're looking for things to do around the city for all meals of the day, entertainment for during the day while we're out, plus a place to go to at night to have some fun. We did something similar for our first wedding anniversary so I'll give some context based on where we've been before and what we're looking for this year. 

Breakfast - We went to the Sugar n' Spice diner, and absolutely loved it! This year instead of a classic American diner, we're looking for a place with good coffee (I love a good iced coffee) and pastries.

Lunch - We went to The Arepa Place and it was my favorite stop of the day. For lunch we're really open to anything so please tell us your favorite place! Since we're planning to eat out all day we'd prefer a lighter lunch. 

Dinner - We went to Zundo and it was my husbands favorite place of the day. This year we would love to do a cooking class, but can't find one that's offering a class the 10th. If we can't do that, I would love to find another Japanese inspired restaurant to visit this year. We're considering Kawa revolving sushi for this if we can't find anything else. 

Nightlife - We went to Ghost Baby before and it was great, the bartender that night was the sweetest and it ended the night on a great note. We didn't really have an idea what we were walking into at the time so we didn't reserve a spot in the den that night, which I do regret. The only things we're currently considering is going back to Ghost Baby or going to Pins Mechanical. We're really just looking for a bar with something for entertainment, whether that be a live show or games for us to play. 

Entertainment for the day - We mainly just walked the city last time. We took a little tour around Findlay Market and walked from one location to the next. This year we were considering Krohn conservatory or Par 3 (In Newport, we'd like to try to stick to Cinci though). On this we are totally open to any options!

Bahrain‚Äôs New Business Boom in 2025\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting., Bahrain GDP grew by 4.4% in Q1 2025, outpacing most Gulf economies. Forbes Business featured Bahrain as this year‚Äôs top destination in the GCC for SME growth, thanks to streamlined regulations and a sharp focus on industrial diversification.\
The Economic Development Board (EDB) reported that foreign direct investment soared to $1.5 billion, with manufacturing and logistics leading the way. Tech and industrial services in the Bahrain Bay corridor are now major players. And while Dubai and Riyadh have flashier headlines, Bahrain‚Äôs true edge is in its transparency, speed, and 100% foreign ownership policy for most industrial activities.\
\
‚ÄúBahrain‚Äôs regulatory reforms and digital-first licensing platforms are rewriting the playbook for easy, secure industrial company formation.‚Äù\
‚Äî GulfNews UAE source\
\
For anyone diving into Bahrain company formation, knowing the licensing process‚Äîand which local customs can speed things up‚Äîis more important than ever.\
\
Understanding Industrial Licensing Requirements\
What Is an Industrial License?\
An industrial license in Bahrain is your legal permit to manufacture, assemble, process, or package products on an industrial scale. Issued by the Ministry of Industry & Commerce (MOICT), it‚Äôs mandatory for factories, workshops, and most production-based businesses.\
Importantly, since early 2025, Bahrain updated its licensing law (Ministerial Decree No. 16/2025) to require stricter environmental and safety compliance, plus real-time LMRA labor records during license issuance.\
Who Needs an Industrial License?\
You need an industrial license if your Bahrain business will:\
- Manufacture or process goods\
- Assemble components at scale\
- Package, bottle, or label products in bulk\
- Operate a workshop with heavy machinery\
- Export manufactured products under Bahrain‚Äôs name\
Not sure if your activity qualifies? Check the Bahrain Sijilat system or consult official regulations.\
\
Step 1: Choose The Right Business Structure\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration. ‚Äì Most popular and flexible for foreigners\
- B.S.C. Closed (Bahrain Shareholding Company Closed) ‚Äì For larger or multi-owner industrial firms\
- Branch Office ‚Äì If you already have a company overseas\
- Single Person Company (SPC) ‚Äì For solopreneurs\
My recommendation?\
If you‚Äôre new to Bahrain, go for a W.L.L.: it‚Äôs fast to register, works for most industrial activities, and is 100% foreign-owned for most sectors (see details).\
Refer to this resource for an entity type comparison: Bahrain business type structures.\
\
Step 2: Secure Your Business Address and Facility\
Surprisingly, your industrial application must include a valid Bahrain address for both your registered office (often in the Seef District or Bahrain Bay) and your industrial facility.\
Pro tip:\
Get your municipality pre-approval before signing anything long-term! Some zones (like the Salman Industrial City area) expedite paperwork‚Äîespecially if you build relationships with local officials during majlis meetings.\
Major Business Zones:\
- Salman Industrial City\
- BIIP (Bahrain International Investment Park)\
- Hidd Industrial Area\
- Bahrain Logistics Zone\
- Free zones (advantages here)\
I once lost three weeks because my lease wasn‚Äôt properly stamped by the municipality. Save yourself: triple-check every signature and get friendly with your district‚Äôs business registration clerk.\
\
Step 3: Gather Required Documents (and Insider Shortcuts)\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation. automates a lot, but you must upload precise, fully translated (Arabic & English) documents.\
Common requirements:\
- Commercial register application form (from Sijilat)\
- Passport copies for all owners and managers\
- Board resolution (if corporate shareholders involved)\
- Memorandum & articles of association\
- Municipality approval of industrial premises\
- Lease agreement (minimum 1 year, stamped)\
- Site plan and facility layout\
- Environmental approval certificate (New since March 2025!)\
- LMRA pre-approval for labor plan\
- Health & safety compliance plan\
Time-Saving Insider Tips\
\
Prepare digital AND hard copies‚Äîgovernment offices still insist on both in certain locations (especially the Industrial Licensing Directorate at Seef).\
Apply between 9-11 AM, Sunday-Wednesday: Less crowded, faster document checks.\
Book a ‚ÄúVIP counter‚Äù appointment at the Diplomatic Area‚Äôs MOICT branch; pays off in weeks saved.\
\
If you need professional help, I always recommend Keylink‚Äôs process experts‚Äîthey know which document fields are routinely flagged for error.\
\
Step 4: Submit Application Online (or In-Person‚ÄîHere‚Äôs Why)\
Bahrain‚Äôs digital Sijilat platform is world-class, but‚Äîhere‚Äôs my personal experience‚Äîsometimes a quick personal visit to the Seef Area Sijilat helpdesk can resolve technical errors faster than endless online ‚Äútickets.‚Äù\
Go to Sijilat.bh, create your business profile, upload documents, and select ‚Äúindustrial license.‚Äù\
Pay the initial application fee (25-100 BHD depending on activity).\
You‚Äôll get:\
- A receipt with reference number\
- SMS/email acknowledgment\
Insider Knowledge:\
Bring business cards and a traditional coffee thermos for in-person trips. Bahrainis value the majlis atmosphere, and a genuine handshake in the waiting area can work wonders for your application‚Äôs speed.\
\
Step 5: Licensing Review, Inspections, and Approvals\
The MOICT coordinates approval with:\
- Civil Defense (fire safety)\
- Environmental Authority (new 2025 regulations‚Äîexpect a site visit)\
- Municipality (zoning, waste management)\
- LMRA (labor plans)\
This usually takes 7-21 business days. During Ramadan, timings shift and some inspections can be quicker due to lighter workloads.\
Challenge I faced:\
During one high season, my inspection was delayed by two weeks because my contact number had a typo in Sijilat. Always double-check your phone/email data‚Äîcorrections take days to propagate across platforms.\
\
Step 6: Pay Final Fees, Collect License, and Register for Tax/VAT\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs..\
Collect your license at MOICT (Seef District is fastest) or opt for courier.\
Next steps:\
- Register for VAT if turnover exceeds 37,500 BHD/year\
- Open a Bahrain bank account\
- Register with the LMRA for employee visas\
Cost Breakdown:\
- Application fees: 25‚Äì100 BHD\
- Municipality lease stamping: ~50 BHD\
- Environmental safety review: ~100‚Äì250 BHD\
- Annual license renewal: 100‚Äì500+ BHD\
- Sijilat VIP processing: 50‚Äì200 BHD (optional but highly recommended)\
For a detailed breakdown: Bahrain company formation cost\
\
Step 7: Post-Licensing Compliance ‚Äì Accounting, Reporting, and Renewals\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.)\
- LMRA labor audits\
- Updated environmental and safety documentation\
Don‚Äôt ignore reminders! Late renewals lead to automatic fines (20-100 BHD/month) and, if severe, license suspension.\
Bahrain‚Äôs system is less bureaucratic than Saudi Arabia‚Äôs and more personal than Dubai‚Äôs‚Äîbut relationships matter. Maintaining regular contact with your MOICT officer goes a long way (especially during regulatory updates).\
\
Ownership Options: 100% Foreign, Local Sponsorship, and Free Zones\
\
Alt text: Professional business support.).\
However, certain sectors (defense, sensitive food, energy) require a local partner.\
Free Zones:\
Setting up in a Bahrain free zone (e.g., Bahrain Logistics Zone, BIIP) gives added tax benefits and simplified customs (learn more).\
But you may face higher rent or stricter export quotas.\
Local Sponsorship:\
Useful if you lack extensive Bahrain experience, want deep local market access, or need quick municipal approvals (see sponsorship options).\
\
Unexpected Tangent: Ramadan Timings and Coffee Traditions\
It might sound off-topic, but knowing Ramadan business hours saved me hours of frustration. During the holy month, government offices open earlier and close by 2 PM, and official business slows mid-afternoon.\
And never underestimate the power of sharing Arabic coffee during negotiations‚Äîmy best contacts were made this way while waiting for a clerk at the MOICT‚Äôs Diplomatic Area lounge.\
\
2025 Regulatory Updates Affecting Industrial Licensing\
The biggest 2025 change?\
Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) are now mandatory for all new industrial licenses as of March 1, 2025.\
Implementation requires third-party certification, which adds 1‚Äì2 weeks and ~100‚Äì250 BHD to your timeline and budget.\
Review government updates or consult a local firm specializing in new EIA protocols.\
\
Bahrain vs. UAE/Saudi: What Makes Bahrain Stand Out?\
Bahrain‚Äôs edge is speed, cost, and personal touch. Unlike the UAE, where notarized documents can take weeks, Bahrain‚Äôs Sijilat integrates digital and physical processes for a 1‚Äì4 week average timeline.\
And unlike Saudi, Bahrain‚Äôs labor market is more flexible, with none of the cumbersome local Saudization quotas for most industrial firms.\
\
Recommended Resources & Common Pitfalls\
Biggest mistake? Not preparing dual-language documents or forgetting to have your lease stamped BEFORE submitting to Sijilat.\
Another common error: assuming any business address will do. Bahrain‚Äôs zoning rules are strict‚Äîalways check with the municipality or use a specialized business center as interim office space.\
I highly recommend Keylink‚Äôs business formation services for hands-on support, document review, and application troubleshooting‚Äîthey have saved me more than once.\
\

1nm1zka,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nm1zka/should_you_try_the_best_singleserve_coffee_pods/,Should You Try the Best Single-Serve Coffee Pods from Tim Hortons,"I‚Äôve been testing the Tim Hortons Original Blend, Medium Roast Single-Serve Coffee Pods for weeks now, and they've become a staple in my mornings‚Äîa testament to their convenience and quality. As someone who relies heavily on a good cup of coffee to kickstart the day, I had certain expectations walking into this experience. Having these Tim Hortons pods at my fingertips has been a game-changer for those rushed mornings. Let me share my thoughts in detail, pointing out both the highlights and the areas that might be worth considering.

**Signature Taste and Aroma**  
The flavor profile is the heart of any coffee experience, and this medium roast didn‚Äôt disappoint. What stands out about the Tim Hortons Original Blend is its perfect balance of rich notes and smoothness. Each pod contains 100% Arabica beans sourced from Central and South America, ensuring a refined flavor. The moment the brew starts, my kitchen fills with the warm, familiar aroma that feels like stepping into a Tim Hortons caf√©. It isn‚Äôt overly dark or bitter, making it an excellent choice whether you enjoy your coffee black or dressed up with cream and sugar.  

**Flawless Compatibility with Keurig Machines**  
Brewing frustration is definitely not on the menu here. These coffee pods are designed to seamlessly work with Keurig single-serve brewers. No leaks, no glitches, just a smooth brewing experience. I‚Äôve used them on three different machines, including a basic Keurig model at home and an upgraded version at the office, and every single pod brewed perfectly without any issues.  

[Check Tim Hortons 1 price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b07s9h32x5/)

**Eco-Friendliness and Recycling Options**  
Tim Hortons has taken an admirable step forward in encouraging sustainability. They recommend emptying the used coffee grounds and recycling the pod components if local facilities support it. While it might not immediately eliminate coffee-related waste entirely, it‚Äôs reassuring to know they are conscious about their environmental impact. I‚Äôve been religiously collecting the used pods and working them into my composting routine where possible. However, removing the grounds from the tightly sealed pod can be tricky at first.  

**Upsides**  
- The coffee delivers a consistently smooth and balanced flavor.  
- Pods fit effortlessly with Keurig brewers, avoiding any technical issues.  
- Sustainability-minded with a recycling initiative for used pods.  
- Fresh aroma replicating the Tim Hortons caf√© experience at home.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Some might find the medium roast lacking the boldness of a stronger brew.  
- Recycling the pods can be inconvenient for households without local facilities.  
- Packages don‚Äôt include a variety sampler, which could appeal to mixed-palate households.  

**Other Options Worth Considering**  
Having coffee pod options on the market can make it tough to decide which brand delivers the best experience. Compared to Starbucks and Green Mountain Coffee pods, I‚Äôd say Tim Hortons stands out for its unique, no-frills smoothness. Starbucks pods tend to have a richer, more robust flavor, which is perfect for dark roast fans but might feel overpowering to others. On the other hand, Green Mountain pods are milder but lack the distinct flavor depth that Tim Hortons retains. If loyalty to a balanced brew with a touch of Canadian charm is your thing, these pods are a no-brainer.  

**Cost-Efficiency**  
With coffee-drinkers like me refilling our mugs multiple times a day, pricing is always a strong consideration. These pods strike a solid balance between affordability and quality, ensuring you feel you‚Äôre getting your money‚Äôs worth. While not the cheapest option available, you‚Äôre essentially paying for the unique Tim Hortons experience, and honestly, I think that's worth the slight premium. Combine that with the convenience of single servings and minimal prep time, and you‚Äôve got a hassle-free process that feels genuinely worth spending on.

1nm1yrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AngelInvesting/comments/1nm1yrz/recommendation_for_good_affiliate_programs/,Recommendation for good affiliate programs,"I‚Äôm thinking of creating a website to promote products using affiliate links. I‚Äôve done some research on affiliate programs, specifically Rakuten, Temu, and Amazon. I‚Äôll write a few words about each so you understand why I‚Äôm asking here. :)

Rakuten:

Super cool, a wide variety of products and brands, easy to use and add products to your site. The big issue? They shut down accounts left and right, with money still in them, which you never see again. And most often without explanation, there are people who didn‚Äôt even break the terms. I had an account with them, started working on the site and adding products, and they closed my account with no explanation. Good thing I hadn‚Äôt started promoting anything yet. After looking into it, I found out what I just said, it‚Äôs a horror story. I‚Äôm amazed they‚Äôre still in business; they should be getting sued every day. So that‚Äôs a no, I don‚Äôt want to spend six months to earn $2,000 and then never see it.

Temu:

In short, they offer good commission payouts, but the problem is with the model they chose. A referral only qualifies if the person never had the Temu app installed, installs it through your link, and places an order within 30 days. In other words, if they visit your site and browse from their browser, tough luck. Same if they go through your link and buy the product but already have the app installed. Basically, the chances of making money with their affiliate program drop to near zero because a lot of people already have the app. So again, pass, waste of time.

Amazon Associates:

You‚Äôd think that because of the Amazon brand, this would be solid and profitable. Nothing could be further from the truth. Despite Amazon‚Äôs growing profits over the last 15 years, affiliate commissions have been steadily dropping since 2012. From what I‚Äôve read, you basically earn coffee money with how poorly they pay. Add to that the fact that an order must be placed within 24 hours after someone clicks your link, otherwise it doesn‚Äôt count so you can cross this one off too.

So, as you can see, I‚Äôm pretty disappointed, and it seems like it‚Äôs not really worth building a site, listing products, and investing in ads and promotion if there aren‚Äôt good affiliate programs out there. Do you have any recommendations that are at least somewhat decent? By that, I mean:

Cookies that last at least 14 days ‚Äî not everyone buys immediately after clicking your link

No need to pay huge commissions, but not peanuts like Amazon either

Don‚Äôt randomly close your account with money in it for no reason

Basically, just some decency and respect for the time you put into promoting their products, nothing more.",1,1758384035.0,AngelInvesting,0,1.0,False

Later that evening, as the sky darkened and the faint hum of crickets filled the air, Ren was back home, sprawled in front of his gaming console. The glow from the screen bathed his messy room, the controller firm in his hands as he focused intensely on the online multiplayer ranked match.

The tension in the game was palpable, his teammates barking commands through his headset. Ren's brow furrowed in concentration. ""Play the objective, you noobs!"" he snapped, his voice dripping with frustration as the action heated up.

""Ren?"" His mother's voice called from the doorway.

""Not now!"" Ren shouted without turning, his hands gripping the controller tightly as his character dodged an incoming attack.

She stepped inside, wearing a light sweater over a simple skirt with an apron tied at her waist. She carried the scent of freshly made dinner with her, soft and motherly despite her son's tone. ""Dinner's almost ready,"" she said gently, her voice cutting through the sounds of gunfire from the game.

Ren groaned loudly. ""I'm in the middle of a ranked match! I can't pause this!"" His voice was sharp, frustration clear.

""But it's your favorite‚Äîteriyaki, with extra sauce,"" she offered, her tone warm but hesitant. ""Just the way you like it.""

""I'll eat in my room later!"" Ren snapped, glancing briefly at her. ""Just leave it there, okay?""

She frowned but didn't press further. Stepping closer, she brushed a stray lock of hair out of his face, her fingers hesitant. ""Ren, we'd love it if you'd join us tonight. Your father's already at the table. We hardly get to sit together as a family anymore.""

Ren ducked away from her hand, his eyes flicking back to the screen. ""Yeah, yeah, I'll eat later.""

Her smile faltered, but she straightened, adjusting her apron. ""Alright, I'll leave a plate for you. Just‚Ä¶ don't let it go cold, okay?""

""Okay,"" Ren muttered, barely acknowledging her.

She left quietly, the sound of her slippers fading down the hallway. Ren returned to the game, but his focus wavered for a moment, his frustration bubbling over as the enemy team gained the upper hand.

""Damn it, no! Push left! What the hell are you guys doing?"" he shouted into his headset. But it was too late‚Äîhis team lost the match.

Ren slammed the controller onto the desk, letting out an angry growl. ""Ugh! Are you kidding me?! Thanks, Mom!"" he yelled at the now-empty doorway, blaming her interruption for his loss.

He sat there, fuming, the controller abandoned on the desk. His phone buzzed on the coffee table, pulling his attention away. Snatching it roughly, he unlocked it to find a flood of unread messages from one of the school group chats.

He scrolled through the chat, irritation bubbling up as he read:

**YukiShine‚ú®:** Ren, could you cover me for math homework tomorrow? I'll owe you one!  
**üòåüëç:** Hey Ren, can you bring your notes? I missed the last two classes.

Ren's lips curled into a sneer. ""Yeah, right,"" he muttered, arching an eyebrow.

""They never ask how I'm doing or what I want. It's always just: *Hey, help me out with this. Do that.* I'm not their personal assistant."" He thought bitterly. ""I bet they don't even remember my name.""

With a sharp flick, he muted the chat and tossed his phone aside, letting out a heavy sigh. He grabbed his plate of food, plopped down on the couch, and opened YouTube, scrolling aimlessly for something to watch. He settled on a gaming stream and dug into his food.

The streamer's voice filled the room, but it couldn't drown out the nagging noise from down the hall. His parents' laughter echoed faintly, warm and unbothered. Ren rolled his eyes, irritation bubbling up.

*""Do they always have to be so loud? Can't they take their happy little chats somewhere else?""* he thought bitterly. ""*I get it‚Äîyou're the perfect couple. Now shut up already.""*

He set his plate down, wiping his hands on his pants, and grabbed his phone. Scrolling through social media, he paused on a post.

**\[LIMITED-TIME OFFLINE EVENT ‚Äî GACHA: ETHER SOULS - MEGACITY TOKYO LOCATION\]**  
**Date: TOMORROW, 9 AM - FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE!**

His eyes widened.

""No way‚Ä¶"" he breathed, leaning forward like the news might vanish if he blinked. His fingers flew across the trackpad, scrolling through the comment thread below. Screenshots of exclusive merch, in-game rewards, and early beta character trials flooded the feed.

A pang of urgency jabbed at his chest.

If he wanted to go‚Äîreally go‚Äîhe'd need to move fast.

He glanced at the clock.  
01:12 AM.

""Damn,"" he muttered. ""That's happening tomorrow?""

For a moment, he froze. Then he yawned, stretching like a cat too lazy to care despite the chaos. His knuckles cracked. His back popped. He shut his laptop with a low *thunk*, the screen fading to black and casting the room in dim LED shadows.

The pile of unwashed laundry in the corner of his room might as well have been a mountain. The desk was a disaster zone‚Äîhalf-crushed cans of melon soda, torn-up gacha codes, and instant ramen wrappers formed a little ecosystem of neglect.

But Ren didn't care.

""Shit,"" he mumbled, voice muffled by the pillow he flopped face-first into.

The phone he tossed onto the chair buzzed once, showing a reminder to ""Charge your pass for train fare.""

Ignored.

He let out a final groan, burrowing into his bed like the world outside no longer mattered. Within moments, his breath steadied. The hum of the city outside melted into the white noise of a sleepless Tokyo night.

Tomorrow could wait.  
But Ether Souls couldn't.

The next morning, sunlight streamed through the kitchen window, casting golden ribbons of light across the pale wood counters and the polished floor. The table was already set: a bowl of steaming miso soup, gently swaying with the rise of heat, sat beside a small plate of perfectly cut toast and a soft-boiled egg. The air smelled faintly of soy and seaweed, familiar and comforting.

""Ren,"" his mother called gently from where she stood by the stove, still in her apron. ""Eat your breakfast before you go.""

At the doorway, Ren paused only to adjust the strap of his bag over one shoulder, fingers brushing impatiently against the buckle. His eyes didn't even glance at the food.

""Not hungry,"" he muttered, already reaching for the handle.

His mother took half a step toward him, voice rising with concern. ""At least take‚Äî""

*Click.*

The door shut.

A long silence followed, thick as the scent of soup that still hung in the air.

She stood still for a moment, eyes fixed on the space he had occupied, fingers curling tight around the edge of the counter. Her voice cracked under the weight of it all, barely above a whisper.

""I don't know what to do with him anymore‚Ä¶ He barely speaks to us these days. It's like he's shutting us out.""

Across the room, Ren's father sat behind the newspaper, his face hidden until he slowly lowered the crisp pages and folded them with careful precision. He set it down on the table beside his untouched tea, then reached up to adjust his tie, the motion as practiced as it was slow.

""He's at that age now,"" he said, voice measured, emotionless. ""He'll grow out of it.""

His wife turned toward him, frustration flashing in her eyes. ""But what if he doesn't? What if this isn't just a phase? Can't you at least go talk to him?""

He inhaled deeply, then exhaled through his nose‚Äîsharp and deliberate. For a brief moment, he rubbed at his temples like the weight of the morning was finally starting to press against him. Then, quietly, he pushed himself to his feet.

""Alright‚Ä¶"" he said. ""I'll try and talk to him later.""  
  
Silence settled back into the room like dust, undisturbed and lingering. The morning light was still there‚Äîstreaming softly through the window‚Äîbut it did nothing to ease the cold tension that hung between the walls of that house.





Ren walked in silence, hands shoved into his pockets, his bag slung over one shoulder. The crisp morning air bit at his skin, but he barely noticed. Around him, clusters of students headed in the same direction, their chatter a dull, rhythmic murmur that faded into the background.

A pair of girls in the same uniform walked just ahead of him, skirts swaying in rhythm with their steps. Their voices carried softly through the morning stillness.

""Did you hear about what happened to Daichi and Yuto?"" one asked, her tone somber, edged with something like disbelief.

Ren's feet faltered‚Äîjust slightly.

*""Daichi. Yuto.""*

The names echoed, sharp and unwelcome, dragging yesterday's scene into his mind like a rusted hook: Kaito on the floor, bloodied and pleading‚Ä¶ Ren, walking away.

He shut his eyes for a beat too long, forcing his expression blank. His mind pulled down the shutters.

*""Not my problem.""*

He didn't hear whatever the girls said after that. Their voices drifted like fog, meaningless noise. His thoughts were already sealing the memory in a dark, locked drawer he didn't plan to open.

He reached the station and slipped into the crowd. The train to ≈åme was waiting, doors yawning open like a mouth ready to swallow routine.

But Ren didn't plan to go to school today.

As the train rolled along its route, winding through the quiet mountain line, Ren stared blankly out the window until the familiar station passed him by without pause.

*""No turning back now.""*

At the next stop, he rose from his seat, blending into the morning crowd. Navigating through the connecting platforms, he ducked into a restroom and locked himself in a stall. His motions were swift, practiced.

Blazer off. Shirt unbuttoned. The cold stall echoed as fabric rustled and his school uniform disappeared into his bag. In its place: a plain black hoodie and worn jeans. He tugged the zipper up, then pulled a cap low over his eyes.

He emerged and paused at the mirror. A quick glance.

*""Good enough.""*

Minutes later, he boarded a different train‚Äîthis one bound for Tokyo. The further they traveled from the quiet mountains, the more the energy shifted. The train buzzed with anticipation, chatter rising in excitement.

By the time the skyline came into view, glass and steel gleaming against the morning sun, Ren's pulse had started to pick up‚Äînot from guilt, but from something else.

When he stepped out into Akihabara, the city swallowed him.

Bright signs blinked with animated mascots, holograms floated from store displays, and vendors lined the streets shouting over each other with practiced enthusiasm.

""Limited-edition figures, only available today!"" one cried, holding up a box still warm from the delivery truck.

Cosplayers crowded the streets, striking poses for photos. Some wore elaborate outfits that looked straight out of an anime, while others repped characters from the gacha game Ren played.

*'This is insane.""*

He made his way through the crowd, soaking in the atmosphere. Every booth he passed had something tempting‚Äîposters, acrylic stands, keychains, all featuring characters he recognized. The special event banners fluttered in the wind, showcasing exclusive in-game bonuses for attendees.

At one of the demo booths, a group had gathered around a screen, watching a live showcase. Ren slipped in among them. The developers were introducing a new event character, and the audience let out a collective gasp as the 3D model rotated on-screen.

""She looks broken,"" someone muttered.

""I'm pulling for her no matter what,"" another person said.

Ren crossed his arms, eyes glued to the screen. The animation was crisp, the special moves flashy.

*""Yeah, I need her.""*

After watching for a while, he drifted to another stall selling limited-edition merch. A keychain caught his eye‚Äîhis favorite character, rendered in high quality.

Only a few left.

*'If I don't get it now, it'll be gone.""*

Without hesitation, he grabbed one and paid for it, tucking it safely into his bag.

Hours passed in a blur. He tested out new game mechanics, snapped photos of cosplayers, and even grabbed a drink from a themed caf√© pop-up. The entire experience was surreal‚Äîlike stepping into a world he usually only saw through a screen.

For the first time in a while, he felt... free.

But as the sun began its descent, reality crept back in.

He checked his phone.

*""Shit. I need to get back.""*

Quickly mapping out his route, he boarded a train back to Haijima. As he neared the station, he ducked back into the restroom, switching into his school uniform once again. He adjusted the blazer, making sure nothing looked out of place.

When he finally stepped onto the train home, he blended in seamlessly with the exhausted students returning from their normal, uneventful day.

As he sat down, his fingers brushed against the keychain in his pocket.

A small, satisfied smirk played on his lips. *""Worth it.""*

1nm1my1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nm1my1,Protect our teachers!,"To CSSD 11 families, and to all Colorado Springs residents,



Our teachers and schools are under attack. When the educators are attacked, so are the students they serve. Last year teachers were considering a strike due to the impending vote to dissolve the long standing Master Agreement. It‚Äôs common knowledge that teachers have long faced financial issues. Teaching isn‚Äôt a profession known for lucrative salaries. Most teachers are true public servants. They don‚Äôt just give their time, they don‚Äôt punch a time card. They spend late nights and weekends coaching, staffing extracurricular activities, and responding to communications from faculty and parents. They routinely use their own money to provide materials for classes.



Yes, the last few years have seen D11 teacher salaries increase. Those increases came from collective bargaining under the Master Agreement. Both the CSEA and the Board were in agreement that D11‚Äôs low starting wages were an obstacle for attracting and retaining teachers. The fact that D11 now has one of the highest starting salaries for teachers in the state is being misused and misrepresented. With the Board voting to end the longstanding Master Agreement, teachers have lost what little power they had to advocate for their well being, financial security, and rights. They ultimately did not strike during the previous school year as the agreement was still in place. Now that the agreement has been removed, the appropriate notifications have been given to the state, complying with applicable laws.



In retaliation the school board has issued coercive and threatening responses to staff. Through a source requesting anonymity I received some of those documents. In addition I‚Äôve heard anecdotally that the school board has directed IT staff to flag any internal communication referencing the CSEA. Today there‚Äôs a fundraiser for the CSEA. Please if you can donate your time or money to protecting our teachers. This write up isn‚Äôt as complete as I had intended, but time is short.

We own a business that is growing so that is like our baby. But hey 3 months in, should feel like the honey moon stage should still be on. But after we got married we have been distancing from each other. I talked to him about this like a month ago. And he did not do anything. Also some small little things he does feel like he is invalidating my feelings. For example we both catched a really bad flu, he likes to sleep with the A/C on but that makes my throat swollen and cannot sleep through the night. So I told him hey do you mind if for tonight we turn the ac off and we open the window instead. He said "" I will go to the other room and sleep there instead"". So I got upset it was 13¬∞C outside. And the room would be cold enough through the night. I got upset and went to sleep to the other room. Also he says he wants me to have a good relationship with his family and got upset because i asked a family member of his to please clean my car after he used it.  He asked my new car borrowed and returned it with bread crumbs all over, ketchup on the floor and coffee stains on the white leather. I dont have a problem lending my car as long as they take care of it. And if they drain the battery out, to re charge it. (Its an electric car). He said I should ask those things little by little as we are still building a relationship with his family. I think that the Base for any good relationship is respect and if I have to be on tippy toes not make them uncomfortable and my husband is prioritizing his family over their respect to me is a huge red flag already.

It‚Äôs easier to live in denial than deal with the reality that life‚Äôs a never-ending race, and we‚Äôre all just trying not to trip over our own shoelaces.


My ex? Yeah, she‚Äôs an ex now. But the thing is sometimes I wonder, maybe I want someone in my life who‚Äôs actually real. You know, from my office, or maybe from that group of friends I used to hang out with? It could be organic, something like a scene straight out of a rom-com. I dream of something organic you know, falling for someone from office or the friend circle. But most of them are either married, taken, or have the IQ of an Instagram filter. let alone my heart.

Isn‚Äôt it weird how we all want that organic connection, but all we get are organic vegetables in the fridge that no one touches? Same thing, right?

Anyway, sometimes I wonder why I‚Äôm so busy with work that I barely have time for people who are actually interested in me. People think I‚Äôm ghosting, but nah, it‚Äôs just that I can‚Äôt remember the last time I didn‚Äôt have a line of code open or a server that‚Äôs not responding at the most inconvenient time.

I haven't had intimacy in so long, I'm starting to think the last person who touched me was the biometric sensor on my laptop.


Honestly, I‚Äôm just waiting for the day I look up and see that one person who isn‚Äôt a walking glitch in my life. But until then, I‚Äôll just keep swiping through Bumble like it‚Äôs a game of ‚Äúfind the least broken human.‚Äù

Sex doesn‚Äôt even top the wishlist anymore. I just want someone who asks how my day was, doesn‚Äôt treat vulnerability like a bug, and maybe holds my hand like I‚Äôm not about to crash emotionally

Porn doesn‚Äôt even feel exciting anymore. It's like opening Jira for pleasure. Looks promising, ends in disappointment.

Let‚Äôs talk about positivity for a second. You know that kind of calm vibe you get from temples, gyms, or quiet cafes? Yeah, not from liquor. Because trust me, I drink. I do. But let‚Äôs be honest whisky isn‚Äôt the answer to life‚Äôs existential crises, no matter how much you want to convince yourself otherwise. Maybe you find some kind of peace in a cold beer, but deep down you know it‚Äôs more like a temporary buffer to your impending breakdown.

And mental peace? Ha. Mental peace comes from hitting that gym for an hour (before you curse yourself for doing it) and then basking in the glory of actually feeling like you accomplished something that doesn‚Äôt require an internet connection. It‚Äôs not from the 8th shot of tequila you took because your life doesn‚Äôt fit the ""Instagram aesthetic.""

I mean, positivity doesn‚Äôt come from a hangover, does it?


Here‚Äôs the reality check: we‚Äôre not sprinting through life. I don‚Äôt want to. In fact, I‚Äôll happily walk, jog, or crawl with a cup of chai in hand while you race to meet your next deadline. I‚Äôd rather arrive late and keep my sanity than burn out early and get stuck with a lifetime supply of stress balls and anxiety medication.

And don‚Äôt even get me started on judgment. People judge faster than you can say ‚Äúdouble-tap.‚Äù Someone juggling 12 dating apps and 6 casual hookups will still look down on a sex worker as if the difference is morals and not monetization. Funny, right? One gets paid, the other just collects validation and red flags. But hey, society doesn‚Äôt operate on logic. It runs on filters, flexes, and a whole lot of selective memory.

And honestly? No one gives a damn if you‚Äôre broke, healing, or just trying to figure out your life. There‚Äôs always someone ready to reduce you to a headline one they‚Äôve only read halfway through. And trust me, it‚Äôs never the right conclusion.

I‚Äôm just here to say: I don‚Äôt need to fit into anyone‚Äôs filter. Because, let‚Äôs face it, they wouldn‚Äôt even understand the tech stack I work with. Hell, they don‚Äôt even know what a ""merge conflict"" is, let alone what it feels like to spend 3 hours fixing a bug that doesn‚Äôt even exist.

So let‚Äôs get real for a second.


Love? Not the fairytale kind.

I mean the quiet kind. The kind that feels like home. The kind where you‚Äôre not trying to impress anyone, and instead, you can just breathe without wondering if your profile pic is getting enough likes.

Because honestly? I‚Äôm done with the whole ‚Äúswipe, ghost, repeat‚Äù cycle. I just want something simple. Something where I can just chill, maybe talk about life without pretending to be a better version of myself. Maybe that‚Äôs the real love we‚Äôre all looking for. Just someone who gets it.

So, here‚Äôs to slow mornings. Here‚Äôs to not being a human productivity machine. Here‚Äôs to real conversations, not just DMs.


Here‚Äôs to calmness over chaos, tea over tequila, and peace over pressure. Because we‚Äôre not behind in life, we‚Äôre just on a different route. And that‚Äôs perfectly okay.

Let‚Äôs stop surviving, and let‚Äôs start living slowly, softly, and with full hearts. And if you want to join me in that journey? Please, do. I‚Äôve got chai and bad jokes waiting.",1,1758382833.0,bondha_diaries,1,1.0,False

When in enid's body, bruno tries to surprisingly put his hands on wednesday's eyes and she flipped him off and was about to beat him to a pulp(since she doesn't like surprise AND being touched esp without permission)but in s1 (the picture above) when tyler puts his hand on her mouth she just stops(ok maybe because his father was passing)but even after he goes away she just slightly pushes tyler.

2.in the same episode we see wednesday(in enid's body)tells enid to go and get a coffee from stand and sit in a corner quietly, then agnes appears in front of enid with a coffee and reveals that's how wednesday gets her coffee everyday-like agnes appearing and giving coffee to wednesday and we never see her wandering around and except for murder cases, she is in her dorm and nevermore. She stops getting a quad or coffee from weathervane or anywhere out of nevermore. Which is interesting because didn't the school have this stand before..??or can't she go for her quad at weathervane now?..

Welcome to another late-night login. Another day where I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm on a break from work or if the break is what‚Äôs working me. The workday blurs into night, and suddenly, I‚Äôm stuck in a Matrix version of reality where coffee‚Äôs the red pill, and sleep‚Äôs the blue pill only one of them makes me feel like I might be alive for a few hours.

I'm looking for an ND LCSW based in the US who'd be willing to have a 30 minute Zoom conversation about the challenges of engaging with clients as an ND clinicians. I would be very happy to remotely buy you a coffee (there has to be a way to do this...) while we talk!

I am an AuDHD mid-life career-changing MSW student in Illinois. Yes, this is for a class assignment but I'm trying to make it useful for my own situation. Engagement is one aspect of the process that I expect to struggle with so I'd really like to hear the perspective of neurodivergent therapists.

I'm asking for help on Reddit because I don't feel comfortable asking my IRL community. At the advice of this sub, I am not disclosing to my program that I am ND and I'm being careful to not reveal it to potential future employers, so I'm struggling to find someone local I could talk to.

You can reply here or DM me and we can set up a call whenever is most convenient for you. Thank you!",1,1758382639.0,NDtherapists,0,1.0,False

I have this space that used to be a garage for cars, but it‚Äôs always been used more like a ‚Äústudio-ish‚Äù space. Now we want to turn it into a small coffee shop. At some point in the past, someone added that drywall partition wall, but I feel like it doesn‚Äôt really fit the shape of the space. Since it‚Äôs a rectangle with natural light coming in from the garage door, that wall in the middle cuts it off abruptly, makes the back darker, and breaks the flow of the room.

What do you think? Do you feel like it could be used better without that wall? Personally, I think it goes against making the most out of the space. It would be a small grab-and-go caf√©.

Forgive my mistakes, I'm not English native and I'm pretty nervous right now.

Story time.
I'm writing as I'm thinking, I hope I didn't leave anything unfinished.

Today it all started with my kid crying for mama. He was with his dad, but he was crying for me. As he didn't settle, I went to his room to settle him.
Dad got angry with me because ""I could went early"". Today was like that. Other days it's because I didn't give him the time or the chance to settle him.
(My kid is almost 2, we aren't talking about a new born anymore).

After maybe an hour trying to put him again to bed, he asked me to go downstairs, where his toys are. We went downstairs and dad was there. He was visibly annoyed to see us there, because, as he says plenty of times ""he can't be anywhere"".

I prepared my kids breakfast while I was making myself a coffee. I asked my boyfriend 2 times if he wanted one, no answer. We where in the same room, so the chances of not hearing him were low.
I went to have breakfast with my kid. ""Where is my coffee, I asked you for one"".
Yesterday was the same. He was about to go out to drop the kid in nursery, I asked him if he wanted a coffee, he told me ""I'll do it myself when I'm back"". He blamed me for not making him the coffee. I told him his exact words but he never say that.

Going back to today. Everything went fine for a couple of hours. He put kid to nap, and asked me for together time (you know). I told him I wasn't feeling okay and I didn't want. 
And everything exploded. He smashed the garage door and went out for as long as the kid's nap lasted.

Since that moment he even looked at me. He went to nap while the kid and I had lunch, then I played with him for a good couple of hours.
He woke up because he was meeting his brother, and I told him I didn't want to go (it's not new, sometimes I go, others I don't)

He started telling me I ruined the day since 6am and I keep ruining his day, day after day. He get violent and left with the kid.
I'm worried because he drives like he's mad.


I might be the fault of everything. I might be wrong. But I'm starting to feel like he's trying to get me mad. He's always saying a thing then saying the opposite, and I started noticing.
It all get worse by the time the kid was born. I'm not blaming the kid, please. 

We have no time for each other. And we have no time for ourselves.
I used to have a ton of hobbies prior, but now I don't have time. He never said ""don't worry I take the kid so you can rest"". At newborn stage, I almost went mad. I was with the kid even when I have to shower. He was home.
He spent months blaming me for going to the gym 1h twice a week.  I had to go to physiotherapy (a lower back hernia), and he was mad at me because he had to take care of the kid for 1 hour, 10 days in a row.

On the other side, I spent a lot of weekends by myself while he was out with friends.
He blames me because he can't go with the motorbike. I told him he can. I don't really mind.
Truly, there's no difference between he at home or not. When he's in charge of the kid because I'm showering or cleaning, he's on the phone and the kid's watching TV. While I'm in the same room, he's on the phone.

When we meet other people, he's the best loving caring parent, partner, son and father.

Oh. He get mad because I meet the kid's carer. I asked him to go. I told him I have things to do at work, so it'd be nice if he goes. I ended up going myself. He says I never asked.
I'm doing a course to get a better job. He casually has all the appointments (medical, job, ...) at the same time, so I can't show up. Or blame me for ""abandoning"" the kid (they're together).
I work full time, and I take care of the kid from 15-18:30, where my course starts. He has to watch the kid from 18:30 to 20:30, when kid goes to sleep.

Last year I'd have left the course, but not this year. I really want to do it and it's also his kid.

Yes. I tried to speak to him in multiple occasions. It's always my fault. He never said anything. And when I'm chill discussing (not always happens, I tend to cry), he loses his shit.

Yes. I've planed multiple times on leaving him. He has a great lawyer. He's going to make my life miserable and use the kid.

I'm sobbing.

I hope you fall in love with being alive, even in the cacophony of the streets, in the relentless hustle and bustle that makes your head spin and your heart ache. Let your weary soul rest a little. I see you carrying the pains of life..the disappointments, the invisible scars, the moments that make you question if it‚Äôs all worth it. IT IS. It truly is.

There is magic in the ordinary. If you pause long enough to notice, the petrichor filling up our lungs after a sudden rain, the lavender sky in the morning spilling soft light over the world, the elixir of steam curling off your evening coffee, the small warmth you can hold in your palms to soothe your soul. Look closer. See the wag of your pups tail as it sweeps joy across the floor, the way leaves waltz in the wind like they are speaking to you, the ephemeral sparkle of sunlight threading through the windows. Even the noise, the hurry, the mess of life carries a tenderness, if you open yourself to it.

The world‚Äôs not asking for perfection. Only our presence. And presence itself is enough. So stay.Breathe. Let your heart keep flying with the wind like a kite. For in the end, what else is this life but beautiful hymn and us trying our best to sing along?

Let yourself drink it all in..the warmth of tea, the softness of a blanket, the smell of earth after rain, the beauty of twilight folding over the city,the way stars appear in the night like tiny lanterns, moon guiding you home. Life is fleeting, ephemeral, fragile and yet it offers itself to you in infinite, small magical ways. Let it seep into your bones like honey dripping slowly, like sunlight spilling into a cold room, like a letter written for your soul.

Pause. Breathe. Look. Listen. Notice the secret tenderness that twines through all your days..the little fleeting moments that are everything. Let your heart feel them. Let yourself be comforted by them. Love them. Love yourself for being here, for witnessing them, for being alive in the midst of all this. Your pain and hardships do not define you..they are shadows and even shadows are part of the poetry of light.

Hold on to these moments, the small ones, the ones that feel ordinary. They are everything.

I needed to hear this and maybe you do too, so I‚Äôm putting it here. Sending you all a trillion hugs, bubbas.ü´Çü´Ç

HCBM alleged that SK is so scared of me that SK never wants to come abck to dads house again. 
My husband spoke to her on the phone about this for 17 minutes and it was the most manipulative thing I have ever heard. She was on speakerphone but didnt know i was present. She spent the first 15 minutes or so on the verge of tears begging him to leave me for the safety of their child because SK is supposedly scared of me. I have supposedly *threatened* SK, and I have supposedly physically abused SK. She kept saying that she was on my husband's side, and that she wasnt keeping SK from *him*, she kept saying ""its because of her! Shes the problem!""
When she realized she wasnt getting anywhere with this, she dramatically switched to anger and she expressed anger towards me for having my husband's last name, and DH and I being a ""cute happy little family""

SK admitted later on (to me and DH) that he lied to his mom about being scared of me because he wasnt happy that I disciplined him- said I have no right to discipline him because im not his ""real mom""

On Thursday, BM started texting me like we were friends? She was badmouthing my husband and in-laws to me, and telling me things that I knew were blatant lies, but I didnt call her on it. She even asked me if i was staying with my husband after hearing all of that. Then, after texting me like we were friends, my husband took SK to football practice and BM met him there. 
She texted me afterwards to tell me that she talked to my husband for a bit and thinks her and I should get coffee. 

My husband told me today what she had to say about me at SK's football practice. 
She told my husband that she spoke to someone I went to high school with, and knows ""all about me"". (High school was 10 years ago, and the name she told my husband was not my friend- we simply went to the same school in a small town). 
She said shes looked my record up ""with all of her names""- she told my husband 3 different times that Ive had 3 different last names. Yes, I was married and divorced, I do have traffic tickets and ""failure to buy dog license"" tickets with 3 different last names. 
And she was still trying to convince my husband to leave me- even asked him what he was going to do.

Friday, with Date 3 - Dinner Date - this is a first date

I usually don‚Äôt date multiple men in a week. I usually date one guy at a time. After going on so many dates with 12-13 men from this May/June, I haven‚Äôt met a right guy. All of the men, I‚Äôve declined due to no chemistry or incompatibility after going on 2-3 dates with them. Some were only first date as I felt no chemistry at all on the first date. 

Date 1 is model handsome, could be a model in men‚Äôs fashion or shaving products etc. But he‚Äôs a divorced man with a kid. His situation isn‚Äôt the most ideal as he can‚Äôt spend Friday night. Only Saturday night from 8 pm and Sunday. He‚Äôs a few years younger than me. 

Date 2 and Date 3 are new men. They just asked me out. Just been chatting with them for a few days.  Date 2, successful guy in the same industry as mine. I can definitely talk about work and intellectually connect. A few years younger than me.  Date 3, very successful and wealthy guy. Much older than me. Semi-retired. But a gentleman. We both like arts and a lot in common with hobbies etc. 

I want to expedite the process so I want to go on dates with multiple men in a week.

The calendar fills up. The to-do list expands. But interviews never come.

That‚Äôs because most people confuse activity with progress.

A better approach is short prep, then immediate execution.

* Get your resume and LinkedIn functional, not perfect.
* Write a clear story about how your skills tie to revenue or growth.
* Set daily minimums for outreach and networking.

  
Without a plan steady enough to test it, every new piece of advice will knock you off course.

The people who land fastest don‚Äôt have better backgrounds. They just execute, gather data and refine. Calls turn into interviews. Interviews turn into offers. Offers create new chapters in a career.

**Tilray Brands stock has been trading up by 8.04% the past 5 days due to positive market sentiment and strategic advancements.**

**Imagine with Sch3. Add how many 0's in there? 8% or 80% or 800%? MOON will SHINE!**

**Highlights of Recent Activity, Partial 6 Month Recap, in no particular order:**

* **Just my opinion, but I believe the Italian announcements made the past few months, can be Great for Tilray Brands, for years to come:**
* **Tilray‚Äôs FL Group Teams Up with Molteni, a Major Pharmaceutical Firm Focused on Pain and Substance Dependence Therapies (Opioid addition, Molteni operating in 40 countries, established in the EU for over 100 years).**
* **Tilray Medical Receives Italy‚Äôs First & ONLY Authorization from the Ministry of Health to Distribute Medical Cannabis Flower for Therapeutic Use. Note: In April, prior to these announcements Denise stated the Italian Cancer Drs had traveled to Tilray's Cantanhede, Portugal EU Medical Cannabis Campus. June 24, 2025 these Drs selected ONLY Tilray to provide FLOWER for Therapeutic Use. \*\*Italy is about twice the population of California. As these Italian Drs start prescribing and getting back positive results for Anxiety, Sleep, Pain, etc etc the prescriptions will greatly increase as well.**
* With an ambitious reach, **Tilray is extending its Iconic Cannabis Brand Good Supply to Germany, catering to diverse patient needs within the nation‚Äôs framework.**
* Conversation yesterday, here on Reddit posted by FluidOriginal2330 ‚Ä¢ 1d ago **""We just ordered some ""Made in Germany"" weed from Tilray and it was just excellent. Especially for the price. We had Aurora before and it was also very delicious. I really think they stepped up their game in the last months or since legalization"".**

**NOTE: Tilray's BEST 31 Brands finally in Pharmacies in Germany. (No Longer growing the German Govt Strains from the past 7 years).**

* In another launch, **Broken Coast, Premium, High-Quality market by introducing ‚ÄòBC Selects‚Äô ‚Äî a new selective cannabis line. NOTE: It's really been juiced up ""It features 28‚Äì34% THC, 2‚Äì5% terpene content"" WOW, give me a fire extinguisher!**
* **Notably, Jefferies upgraded Tilray‚Äôs price target from $1.50 to $2, strengthening its stance with a consistent ‚ÄòBuy‚Äô rating**.
* **A commendable milestone by Tilray reinstates its Nasdaq compliance, maintaining a necessary trading price for ten consecutive days, reflective of steady growth. NOTE: I voted YES, I believe its a No Brainer!**
* **Alan B, who had Tilray a ""Strong Buy"" and rode it up over 100%, put out an article that he changed his mind (after he sold out, LOL) I suspect he was hoping the stock would drop and he would be right back in. Alan, Tilray's stock price is still very cheap from where its going.**
* **Tilray's aggressive acquisition strategy in the craft beer space at Fire-Sale prices, spotlighting Shock Top as a key player alongside brands like Atwater, Breckenridge, Blue Point, and 10 Barrel. Simon announced in his closing CC remarks last spring, it a good time to buy breweries, but it's later than the past 2 years and no announcements, YET????**
* **Shock Top Updates ‚ÄúWedgehead‚Äù Label and Expands College Partnerships for 2025:**

**""Shock Top, the craft wheat beer brand under Tilray Brands, is shaking up its visual identity with a bold refresh of its iconic ‚ÄúWedgehead‚Äù lemon wedge character. Each label now invites fans to embrace the unexpected‚Äîthink playful, citrus-forward designs that scream refreshment for tailgates, watch parties, and beyond. The transformation isn't just skin-deep. Shock Top is doubling down on experiential marketing, with a heavy emphasis on college athletics to capture that youthful, high-energy crowd. Key highlights include:**

* **University of Florida (Gators): As a No. 1-seeded powerhouse in the 2025 NCAA Tournament, the Gators' partnership with Shock Top‚Äîannounced in August 2024‚Äîhas been a game-changer. Fans at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium and O'Dome events have reported Shock Top as the top-seller during home games, with sales spiking 25% year-over-year. It's all about that sunny, citrus match to Florida's vibe, and the brand's on-site activations (like branded lemon wedge photo ops) have gone viral on campus socials.**
* **University of Missouri (Tigers): Mizzou's Faurot Field has seen Shock Top dominate concessions, especially during SEC matchups. The partnership, part of Shock Top's Southeast expansion, includes custom co-branded apparel and in-stadium sampling events. Student polls from the university's athletic department show it as the preferred light beer for 40% of undergrads at tailgates, crediting its easy-drinking appeal over heavier IPAs.**
* **University of Colorado (Boulders): New for 2025, this Rocky Mountain tie-in targets high-altitude game days at Folsom Field. Early metrics from beta events show Shock Top outselling competitors by 15%, with the brand leaning into ""altitude-friendly"" refreshment messaging. Campus bars near Boulder report a 20% uptick in orders from students, tying into the school's outdoor-loving culture.**

**Overall, these college collabs are fueling Shock Top's growth in the 21+ demo, with Tilray projecting a 18% volume increase in the craft wheat category for 2025. The strategy? Blend nostalgia (that wedgehead charm) with modern hooks like AR filters for fan photos and limited-edition packs tied to big rivalries. In-stadium experiences round it out‚Äîthink Shock Top-sponsored zones with misting fans, live DJ sets, and free samples for ticket holders. It's not just beer; it's the vibe that keeps universities buzzing about it.**

* **Tilray leveraging canning lines and distribution from all these breweries to ramp up hemp-infused drinks across the Southeast, which ties into that growing trend of cannabis-booze crossovers boosting liquor store. I've heard from good sources Tilray Hemp-Infused is ""all over the USA Southeast"".**
* **Hop Valley Brewing and Oregon Athletics Announce the Launch of Dang Green IPA, the First Official Craft Beer for the Oregon Ducks, which is stirring up a buzz with ‚ÄòDang Green IPA,‚Äô a craft beer creating ripples across Oregon venues.**
* **Breckenridge Distillery and Denver Broncos Kick Off Fifth Year of Partnership with New Lineup of Spirits, Including Limited-Edition Broncos Honey Whiskey**
* **Breckenridge Distillery's Casa Breck Tequila Line: Rocky Mountain Twist on Jalisco Tradition**

**Tilray's Breckenridge Distillery jumped into the tequila game this summer with the July 24, 2025 launch of Casa Breck, their first-ever tequila lineup. It's a fusion of Mexican heritage and Colorado craft, using hand-harvested blue agave from Jalisco's mineral-rich soils, fermented with precision for that authentic bite. The real hook? Aging in Breckenridge's own ex-Bourbon Whiskey barrels‚Äîshipped straight from the Rockies to Mexico‚Äîto infuse unique flavors like caramel, oak, and a subtle black pepper kick, giving it a deeper color and that signature Breck warmth without overpowering the agave core.**

* **Blanco: Crisp and unaged, with notes of cooked agave, vanilla, honey, and lemongrass‚Äîperfect for straight shots or simple mixes.**
* **Reposado: The star here, rested 2-11 months in those Breck barrels for a smoother profile blending agave sweetness with bourbon-esque vanilla and spice.**
* **Upcoming A√±ejo & Extra A√±ejo: Already aging in the same barrels, set for release soon‚Äîexpect even richer oak and caramel layers.**

**This isn't just expansion; it's Tilray leveraging their spirits know-how to tap the booming $7B+ U.S. tequila market, with early distribution in Colorado and plans for nationwide rollout via partners like Winebow in California. Priced premium (around $40-50/bottle), it's aimed at drinkers who want something elevated beyond mass-market options.**

**Mock One Non-Alcoholic Spirits:**

**Zero-Proof Premiums with Real Depth Right on the heels of Casa Breck, Breckenridge dropped Mock One on July 17, 2025 ‚Äî a lineup of non-alcoholic spirit alternatives that punch way above typical ""mock"" fare. Backed by the distillery's nine Icons of Whisky awards, these are crafted with natural ingredients and Breck's blending wizardry to mimic the complexity of booze without the buzz. No artificial junk; just layered profiles for sober-curious folks, Dry January die-hards, or anyone mixing up cocktails minus the hangover. The core four (750ml bottles at \~$30 each +/- $1.50/shot):**

**- Whiskey Alternative: Oak, cinnamon, vanilla bean, and honey‚Äînails that smooth sip for an Old Fashioned.**

**- Gin Alternative: Juniper-forward with Meyer lemon, kaffir lime, and lavender for G&Ts that pop.**

**- Tequila Alternative: Agave, vanilla bean, honey, and a capsaicin whisper‚Äîideal for Margaritas with bite.**

**- Rum Alternative: Caramel, tropical fruit, and spice notes for Daiquiris or dark 'n' stormys.**

**Available now in Colorado stores, nationwide online (drinkmockone.com), and at Breck's tasting rooms‚Äî with fall 2025 retail push. CEO Bryan Nolt calls it ""innovation without sacrificing taste,"" targeting the exploding $500M+ NA spirits market where premium options are flying off shelves.**

# And For The Money Maker, just my Speculation:

* **An Infused Mock Two RTD Line? Love this angle‚Äîit's a natural evolution, especially with Tilray's hemp-derived Delta-9 THC push (like their 5mg-infused 420 Fizz seltzers and Herb & Bloom mocktails rolling out in U.S. states this past fall).**
* **No official word on a ""Mock Two"" yet, but the tea leaves pointing yes: Back in 2021, when Tilray acquired Breckenridge, they explicitly flagged plans for THC-infused non-alcoholic distilled spirits ""when federally permissible""‚Äîand with HDD9 beverages now legal in 30+ states under the Farm Bill, that door's cracking open wide. Irwin Simon at a German Benzinga conference discussed positively Non Alc Tequila Infused with THC. Investor chatter (e.g., Reddit threads and analyst notes) is buzzing about this exact combo: Imagine RTD cans of Mock One profiles spiked with 5-10mg Delta-9 for a low-dose, sessionable buzz‚Äîthink THC Old Fashions or Margaritas in a sleek 12oz format, priced \~$5-7/can, hitting Total Wine or campus bars by Q3 2026. Follow it up with a Non Alc RTD non infused not to over do it. It fits Tilray's ""cannabis-lifestyle"" playbook, blending their $200M+ beverage revenue with the $1B+ NA market's growth. If they're eyeing ""1st to world"" status in infused drinks (as Ty Gilmore hinted last year), this could be it ‚Äî health-conscious, convenient, and tying back to those university partnerships.**

I hope you fall in love with being alive, even in the cacophony of the streets, in the relentless hustle and bustle that makes your head spin and your heart ache. Let your weary soul rest a little. I see you carrying the pains of life..the disappointments, the invisible scars, the moments that make you question if it‚Äôs all worth it. IT IS. It truly is.

There is magic in the ordinary. If you pause long enough to notice, the petrichor filling up our lungs after a sudden rain, the lavender sky in the morning spilling soft light over the world, the elixir of steam curling off your evening coffee, the small warmth you can hold in your palms to soothe your soul. Look closer. See the wag of your pups tail as it sweeps joy across the floor, the way leaves waltz in the wind like they are speaking to you, the ephemeral sparkle of sunlight threading through the windows. Even the noise, the hurry, the mess of life carries a tenderness, if you open yourself to it.

The world‚Äôs not asking for perfection. Only our presence. And presence itself is enough. So stay.Breathe. Let your heart keep flying with the wind like a kite. For in the end, what else is this life but beautiful hymn and us trying our best to sing along?

Let yourself drink it all in..the warmth of tea, the softness of a blanket, the smell of earth after rain, the beauty of twilight folding over the city,the way stars appear in the night like tiny lanterns, moon guiding you home. Life is fleeting, ephemeral, fragile and yet it offers itself to you in infinite, small magical ways. Let it seep into your bones like honey dripping slowly, like sunlight spilling into a cold room, like a letter written for your soul.

Pause. Breathe. Look. Listen. Notice the secret tenderness that twines through all your days..the little fleeting moments that are everything. Let your heart feel them. Let yourself be comforted by them. Love them. Love yourself for being here, for witnessing them, for being alive in the midst of all this. Your pain and hardships do not define you..they are shadows and even shadows are part of the poetry of light.

Hold on to these moments, the small ones, the ones that feel ordinary. They are everything.

1nm0pqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1nm0pqe/should_you_trust_pledge_antibacterial_spray_for/,Should You Trust Pledge Antibacterial Spray for Daily Cleaning?,"Testing out the Pledge 317378 Antibacterial Multisurface Cleaner Spray, I quickly realized how indispensable it has become in my daily cleaning routine. As a self-proclaimed ""clean freak,"" I‚Äôm always on the lookout for a cleaner that not only sanitizes but doesn‚Äôt leave those annoying streaks or harsh chemical smells that can turn a cleaning spree into a headache. This spray had my attention from day one‚Äîpromising antibacterial power wrapped up in a citrusy, feel-good scent.

**Packaging and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed was the compact design of the bottle, which is easy to grip and maneuver‚Äîeven for a klutz like me who‚Äôs prone to spilling! Its ergonomic spray nozzle shoots out an even mist, which is great for a wide surface application without feeling like I‚Äôm wasting any product. At 9.7 ounces per bottle (and with a pack of three), I felt stocked up and ready to tackle any mess. Not to mention, this one gets bonus points for not needing a CSI-level investigation every time I‚Äôve misplaced it under the kitchen sink.

**Ease of Use**  
Using the antibacterial cleaner is as simple as point, spray, and wipe‚Äîno complicated instructions or unnecessary prep. I‚Äôve tested it on sealed hard surfaces like counters, mirrors, and even my dining table, and it performs like a dream. Its ability to clean and sanitize in one swipe while leaving no residue behind had me silently saying ‚ÄúFinally!‚Äù Is there anything more satisfying than a streak-free glossy mirror after a quick spritz? Probably not.

**Upsides**  
- Effortlessly kills common bacteria like E. coli and Salmonella  
- Works perfectly on various surfaces like sealed granite, marble, glass, and mirrors  
- Sweet citrus scent that‚Äôs pleasant but not overpowering  
- Gentle formula that won‚Äôt harm sealed surfaces or leave behind stains  
- Compact size, making it easy to stow away but still long-lasting  

**Combatting Germs Like a Champ**  
Let me be honest here‚ÄîI‚Äôve got kids who think turning the kitchen counter into a sticky playground is a valid life choice. This spray‚Äôs sanitizing power has been my silent partner in the constant battle against grime and germs. What impressed me most was its ability to handle common bacteria without the need for a hazmat suit-style cleaner. With names like Staph and H1N1 covered in the bacteria-killing promise, this product gave me some peace of mind about the family‚Äôs health (and perhaps, my sanity).

[See Pledge 317378 deals on Amazon now.](https://reviews.senaar.com/p/b07ycyyr3w/)  

**Perfume That Cleans**  
Aside from its cleaning capabilities, the light but fresh citrus scent deserves a shoutout. Unlike those overly chemical-laden sprays that make you regret opening windows, this one smells refreshingly clean without being cloying. There are times I‚Äôve walked into the living room after spritzing the coffee table and thought, ‚ÄúWow, the air smells genuinely energized.‚Äù My family even commented on how much fresher our home feels.

**Disadvantages**  
- The spray nozzle could clog slightly if used excessively in one go  
- Works best as a daily cleaner but may not handle heavy-duty grease stains efficiently  
- Scent, while delightful, might not last as long as some people would prefer  

**Competing Brands**  
In comparison to similar products, I‚Äôve tried brands like Lysol and Method, each with its own set of strengths. Lysol is undeniably powerful for disinfecting and might tackle severe grime better, but it often comes with the downside of overwhelming chemical fumes. Meanwhile, Method leans toward eco-friendliness but doesn‚Äôt quite deliver the antibacterial promise that‚Äôs often needed in households with kids or pets. The Pledge spray bridges the gap beautifully‚Äîit sanitizes effectively, smells delightful, and won‚Äôt leave you coughing.

**Financial Value**  
Considering its performance and the quantity provided in the pack, I‚Äôd say it offers particularly good value for what it brings to the table. There are products out there that charge way more for half the features. For those looking to balance efficiency with affordability, this one fits right in. It won‚Äôt break the bank, and with three bottles included, you wouldn‚Äôt be running to the store anytime soon.

I used to post here all the time some years back (deleted most of my posts from back then because I was a really emo teen lol), but here I am again because the existential crisis is only getting worse

I've come to accept that my parents will never acknowledge the fact that their child is a separate human being with their own beliefs and ideas that don't necessarily have to be the same as their own (which honestly I should have realised long ago), so that only leaves two options‚Äîeither break free and somehow manage to cut my entire extended family off in order to make a life for myself, or accept the life they already decided for me before I was even born.

(i.e. get married to some random dude of their choosing that shares the same beliefs and may very well be my cousin, perpetuate the same cycle on my children that said husband will inevitably force me to have because apparently a human's worth is only in how much children they have, and endure the same patriarchal shit that my mother accepted until I die or something idk)

The older I get, the more hope I lose, because in the past that doomed life still seemed far away, but with each year that passes the threat of this happening becomes even more real.

To make it worse, even when I was a frequent visitor of this community before, it seemed to me that everyone was in the same situation, but hearing about someone actually breaking free was a once in a blue moon thing and eventually a lot of people lost their battle anyways... and every day I'm deathly afraid of becoming one of them.

And the most depressing part isn't even about me, it's in grieving what my parents could have been if they had bothered to open their minds‚Äîbecause as much as I used to despise their mindset when I was younger (and I still do), they're still loving at heart. Again, regardless of religion, close mindedness and a lack of love for diversity in general messes up everything.

Point is, if anyone is actually living at least a somewhat free life as of now, any hope at all would be greatly appreciated. Bonus points if you're AFAB (assigned female at birth), part of the LGBTQ, and/or neurodivergent, but genuinely any support at all is appreciated.

Anyways, sorry for the long rant‚Äîdrinking a whole soda on top of coffee was probably not good for my anxiety (for my fellow anxious peeps please stay as far away from caffeine as you can). Cheers to you all, and much love <33",2,1758380937.0,exmuslim,2,1.0,False
1nm0n4t,https://i.redd.it/bmq1q0u75cqf1.jpeg,The Great Cosmic We; Not Me - TheKoinBlog.com,"The wind blew cold from the west and I sat in the coffee shop staring out the dusty pane at the people moving in their little blinks of time and all I could think was:

‚Äú*we are all here together and we don‚Äôt even know it.*‚Äú

Somewhere in this shifting sandstorm of days and faces, somebody said truth was a man on a mountain or a quiet room or the inside of your skull echoing with the sound of God or madness. But I don‚Äôt think so. I think truth is in the crash and the hum and the jazz of life‚Äôs collective roar.

The truth is not me staring out this window. The truth is all of us, the whole damn flock of us, stirring the same soup, dancing to the same distant drum, even if we pretend we don‚Äôt hear it.

I used to think the world was mine to witness. That ‚ÄúI‚Äù was the star and the rest of the cast was just a mob of extras muttering lines while I figured out the meaning of everything. But that‚Äôs just the foolishness of youth, the lonely myth of a soul spinning solo in a crowded world.

You live long enough, or love deep enough, and you start to see it. The weft and warp of the thing. The net of being. We are not atoms bouncing blind, we are breath passed back and forth between bodies, fireflies blinking in chorus, and if one light goes out, the whole field darkens a little.

Reality‚Äôs a riddle anyway. A cracked mirror, a fleeting glimpse, a kaleidoscope spun by chance and blood and memory. You see it your way and I see it mine and neither of us is wrong exactly but neither of us is right either, not alone.

Perception is a trickster, he‚Äôll dress up a shadow and sell it as a fact, give you dreams stitched into logic and call it proof. You can‚Äôt trust it alone. You need more eyes. You need the crowd. You need the ones you love and the ones you hate and the ones you‚Äôll never understand to help you make sense of what this all is.

And individuality, don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs beautiful. It‚Äôs the spice, the song, the flick of color in the mural. We paint our lives with our own weird brushes, our busted palettes, our hiccupped metaphors and bittersweet songs. But no painting means a damn thing without a wall to hang it on, a room for others to walk through and wonder and feel and say, ‚Äú*I see it too‚Äù.*

See, the great con is the idea that we‚Äôre separate. That we earn meaning like we earn paychecks. That you build truth with your bare hands like a backyard fence and nobody else has a say in where it goes.

But truth, real truth, is a communion. It‚Äôs not the moralists or the philosopher or the popes. It‚Äôs everybody at the table passing the bread.

We are not the truth alone. The ‚ÄúI‚Äù is a dot on the map. The truth is the road itself, the long and winding one we stumble down together with laughter and mistakes and dirty boots and open hearts. You can scream your truth to the heavens and still it won‚Äôt echo right until someone hears it, catches it like a tossed stone, and says,¬†*me too, brother.*¬†That‚Äôs when it becomes real. That‚Äôs when it matters.

So let the philosophers chase their tail down lonely halls and let the gurus whisper in their caves, but I‚Äôll sit here with the wild ones, the broken ones, the tired, joyful, half-awake ones, all of us pouring our tea and sharing our crumbs and our strange, stubborn hope that none of this is in vain.

Because truth, if it lives anywhere, lives in the space between us. In the glances that say ‚ÄúI see you,‚Äù in the hands that hold each other up, in the long silences that don‚Äôt feel lonely. Not¬†*me.*¬†Not¬†*you.*¬†But¬†*us.*¬†The Great Cosmic We.

That‚Äôs the message I‚Äôve come to believe. The rest is noise.

[Join us](https://kommunitykoin.com/)¬†in making the world a better place ‚Äì you‚Äôll be glad that you did. Cheers friends.

1nm0mrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nm0mrs/how_we_got_some_petty_revenge_on_a_coworker_from/,How we got some petty revenge on a coworker from another department,"I (27f) work in social work and there are three day shelters for homeless people in the company I work for.   
We are three colleagues in the day shelter I work at and we get along well. We are all under 30 and are only there between a year and four months. Nevertheless we have many daily clients who give us positive feedback and have around 100 clients per day every day. 

There are two other day shelters in the area, run by the same company. The colleagues at day shelter B are really nice and we all get along well. The colleagues at day shelter A aren't. They made it obvious on several occasions that the don't like our team and think they are better than us. 

One colleague, let's call her Regina (also 27f) especially looks down on my colleagues and me and kind of bullys us whenever we do something. One time she helped at our day shelter because one colleague was on vacation and we needed some help that day. She constantly made snide comments about me and my colleague ""being new and inexperienced"" although there was no reason for it. The clients all were safe and calm that day and everything went smoothly. Regina interacted with some people she knew from her day shelter, but didn't do much aside from that. At the beginning of the day I tried to fill her in what was going on lately and who to be a little bit careful around. Regina just cussed me off and told me she didn't need that for she is much more experienced then I am.

For explanation day shelters are usually peaceful places and people are just there to drink coffee, have a chat, sleep or seek help. But on some days there are heavy situations, like people pulling knifes or insulting eachother heavyly to the point of physical aggression. We are good at managing situations like these and we have a security guy there in case everything goes down.

After helping us out that day, we thanked Regina and she just made another snide comment on how we are really knew to the work and that we shoud still become more experienced. Yes, my colleague and I don't work at the day shelter for a long time, but we are both trained in the social field and we both worked at other places before and we aren't any less experienced in handling difficult people than she is. I worked at a psychiatric living environment for years before working at the day shelter and my colleague worked as a social worked for troubled teens, so we both gained a lot of experience just not in a day shelter. 

Regina also criticised how we ""do to much"" and we are just a day shelter not a ""counseling office"". Counselling is in fact something we have to do and it is a main thing we do there. But it is something we have to do. 

Over the last months every time we did something like networking with hospitals, other day shelters or the police, Regina would berate us and comment on how we were ""overreacting"". For explanation we had to deal with an incel guy who did really terrifying stuff at the day shelter and it took us a lot of effort to network with the police and our boss and not just sending the guy off to do his shit somewhere else. 

So, after many insults and Regina being rude to my colleagues and me we finally had enough. In a meeting with all three day shelters and our boss, Regina talked about how difficult it is to network with our local psychiatric hospitals. She said she tried everything and they still refuse networking. 

My colleagues and me recently started networking with the psychiatric ward of our local hospital and it turned out quite well. We even scheduled an in person meeting with us and their stuff to get to know each other and the hurdles we share in our daily work. Regina didn't know this and my colleague rose her hand and said in front of everybody, that we did manage to network and that we scheduled a meeting with their staff. Regina was fuming. She started berating us for not consulting with the other day shelters and refused to help network with other officials afterwards. 

We didn't plan that petty revenge but my brilliant colleague took the opportunity to execute it in the right moment. I hope Regina quits her bs in the future and starts seeing us as colleagues. Otherwise there will be some more petty revenge.",1,1758380885.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

1nm0kxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1nm0kxy/reveal_the_best_coffee_maker_experience_with/,Reveal the Best Coffee Maker Experience with Lavazza Classy Plus?,"Using the Lavazza Classy Plus coffee maker daily has transformed my mornings into energizing, delicious rituals. The convenience and quality of this machine have certainly impressed me, though not without a few quirks. Lavazza is a well-known brand with a reputation for serving rich, Italian-style coffee, and the Classy Plus performs mostly as advertised. Its sleek design and features make it a standout option in the espresso and coffee brewer category.

**Impressive Design and Build Quality**  
The Lavazza Classy Plus grabbed my attention right away with its elegant black finish and compact dimensions of 7.87 x 18.9 x 13.78 inches. Aesthetically, it fits seamlessly into small kitchen spaces without feeling intrusive. Weighing just over nine pounds, the machine felt surprisingly sturdy when I set it up. The adjustable height setting is a smart addition, letting me switch between brewing single shots or larger milk-based drinks like lattes or macchiatos. Even though it looks classy, I noticed that frequent fingerprints on the glossy finish could be annoying, especially if you're a neat freak like me.

**Convenience and Ease of Use**  
What impressed me most about this single-serve coffee machine is how user-friendly it is. The control buttons are intuitive, even for someone like my dad, who's not the most tech-savvy. With just a press of a button, it offers a range of options‚Äîfrom espresso and lungo to milk-based beverages like cappuccinos and macchiatos. My kids even got excited observing how quick the brewing process was. The double-shot function is another handy feature that caters to caffeine enthusiasts. On a busy morning, I appreciated the simplicity: no need for extra accessories or equipment to prepare a delicious cup of coffee.

[Check Lavazza Classy Plus price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b08j8j3s4y/)

**Performance and Versatility**  
This coffee maker does not falter when it comes to performance. The brewing process happens fast, and the drinks are consistently hot and flavorful. Its built-in milk frother is a blessing for anyone who enjoys frothy lattes or creamy cappuccinos. I tested both Lavazza Blue and Expert capsules, and they worked seamlessly, delivering that satisfying aroma that indicates high-quality coffee. However, one drawback is the limited compatibility with capsule types; you can only use Lavazza's proprietary capsules, which might be a dealbreaker for those who prefer a wider variety of options.

**Strengths**  
- Aesthetic and compact design perfectly suits smaller kitchens.  
- Straightforward operation with intuitive buttons.
- Capable of brewing multiple drink types, including espresso, lattes, and macchiatos.  
- Built-in milk frother for creamy coffee creations.  
- Double-shot feature for those needing an extra caffeine jolt.  

**Critiques**  
- Capsule compatibility limited to Lavazza Blue and Expert capsules.  
- Glossy surface prone to visible smudges and fingerprints.  
- Noisy brewing process, especially when frothing milk.  

**Competing Products**  
Looking at alternatives, Nespresso Vertuo stands out with its broader range of capsules and quieter operation during brewing. However, it lacks the built-in milk frother featured in the Classy Plus, requiring an external accessory for frothy drinks. Keurig K-Cafe is another contender, offering compatibility with generic K-cups and excellent versatility for specialty coffees. While both competitors are commendable, neither delivers coffee with the same rich crema and premium flavor that the Lavazza capsules achieve. The distinct advantage of the Lavazza system is its authentic espresso profile, which superiorly mimics a traditional Italian caf√© experience at home.

**Value for Money**  
Investing in the Classy Plus feels worthwhile for coffee lovers who prioritize the quality of their drinks. The proprietary capsules, while restrictive, maintain consistent flavor and crema like no other. Other machines at this price point might appear cheaper with non-branded pods, but they compromise on taste. Regular espresso enthusiasts, especially those fond of cappuccinos and lattes, will find the Lavazza Classy Plus to be a justified expense for what it delivers‚Äîthough budget-conscious shoppers may need to factor in ongoing capsule costs.

1nm0gxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1nm0gxe/aita_for_telling_my_husband_my_ex_was_staying/,AITA for telling my husband my ex was staying with us for a month and not to make it weird?,"My husband found out I was planning to sleep with my ex while he stayed in our house, so he secretly rented out our bedroom on Airbnb and disappeared to Thailand with the money.

My ex reached out three months ago. He'd lost his job, his apartment, everything. We dated for five years before I met my husband, and yeah, we had that kind of connection that never really dies. When he asked if he could crash with us for a month while he got back on his feet, I said yes without thinking.

""Just for a month,"" I told my husband over dinner. ""He'll sleep in the guest room. Don't make it weird.""

My husband just nodded and went back to his pasta. That should have been my first clue something was off. He never just accepts things that easily.

My ex moved in the next week. At first, everything was normal. We'd all eat dinner together, watch TV. My husband was actually being cool about it. Too cool, looking back.

But then the late-night talks started. My ex and I would sit on the back porch after my husband went to bed, drinking wine and talking about old times. One night, he grabbed my hand.

""I never stopped loving you,"" he said.

I didn't pull away. I should have, but I didn't.

We started texting during the day. Little things at first, then more. I'd delete the messages before my husband got home. My ex would find excuses to touch me when my husband wasn't looking. A hand on my back while I cooked. Fingers brushing when I passed him coffee.

I told myself nothing would happen. I was lying.

Two weeks in, my husband announced he had a last-minute business trip. Five days in Seattle. I tried not to look excited.

""That's sudden,"" I said.

""Yeah, well. Things come up."" He kissed my forehead and went to pack.

The night he left, my ex and I opened a bottle of wine. Then another. We were on the couch, too close, his hand on my thigh.

""We shouldn't,"" I whispered.

""Your husband's gone,"" he said. ""Who's gonna know?""

We were heading to the bedroom when I heard voices. The front door opened and a couple walked in with suitcases.

""Oh, you must be the wife!"" the woman said brightly. ""We're the Johnsons. We rented the master bedroom for the week?""

I stood there with my mouth open while they walked past us up the stairs. My ex backed away from me like I was on fire.

""What the hell,"" I managed.

The woman turned around. ""Your husband said you knew? He gave us the code and everything. Said you'd be staying in the guest room while he was away.""

My phone buzzed. A text from my husband: ""Check your email.""

The email had plane tickets. Screenshots of my deleted texts with my ex that he'd somehow recovered. Pictures of us on the porch, holding hands. And a short note:

""I'm in Bangkok. The Airbnb money covered my ticket. Your family knows everything. Good luck.""

By morning, my phone was blowing up. His mom, his sister, my own sister, everyone. He'd sent them everything. My mother-in-law came for the kids that afternoon.

""You can see them when you get your life together,"" she said, not even looking at me.

My ex packed his stuff and left without a word. Just gone, like he'd never been there.

I spent the next week alone in my own house with strangers sleeping in my bed. They complained about the water pressure and asked where we kept the extra towels. I cried in the guest room bathroom so they wouldn't hear me.

My husband came back after two weeks, tanned and calm. He'd apparently had the time of his life. Street food, temples, beaches. He showed me pictures like we were friends catching up.

""I want a divorce,"" he said casually, scrolling through photos of elephants. ""Obviously.""

That was six months ago. The divorce is almost final. I see my kids every other weekend at my tiny apartment. My ex blocked me on everything. Turns out he reconnected with an old girlfriend the week after he left my house.

My husband's dating someone now. A teacher from our kids' school. She's nice. The kids like her.

I keep thinking about that night, wine on my breath, my ex's hand on my thigh, walking to the bedroom like I had any right to be there. Like there wouldn't be consequences. Like my husband was actually stupid enough to just accept his wife's ex living in our house.

I guess I was the stupid one.

Was it wrong that he humiliated me like that instead of just confronting me?

I don't think that something is wrong with me, since I enjoy my time alone. However, I wish to find ways to spend more time around people and feel like a part of a group or neighborhood. I think that living in a big city makes us feel more alienated, since we miss out on the unstructured socializing; every meeting, except for work has to be arranged and organized. spending time with and around people requires a lot of effort, which is why when we meet someone for coffee we feel like we need to use every minute of it by talking or doing something, which is rewarding, but tiring as well. So my question is - how to find more opportunities for unstructured socializing?",1,1758380488.0,AskWomenOver30,8,0.67,False

1nm0f48,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nm0f48,Stats After One Year Playing Pok√©mon Sleep!,"I‚Äôve seen other ppl do this and it looked super fun so here we go! I hit my one year mark today and I love this game and this community so much :)

Island Progress: 
GG - M19 / 75% AB
Cyan - M20 / 75% AB
Taupe - M15 / 47% AB
Snowdrop - M3 / 13% AB
Lapis - M13 / 58% AB
OGPP - M10 / 43% AB

I‚Äôm pretty sure I could M20 GG if I tried; Cyan happened as a complete accident during an event week as I am concentrating more on filling holes in my ingredient/berry coverage than trying for high scores. I also have not even bothered to brave GGEX yet as I‚Äôd rather complete my mon hunt first. I am a min-maxer because I enjoy that aspect of the game but not a perfectionist - if it‚Äôs good enough and fairly future-proof, I‚Äôll start using it and move on to hunting something else. I am pretty cooking-focused at this point and am still trying to find a BFS berry mon for each island (Totodile, I‚Äôm looking at you!!!). 

Also, for context I have had the premium pass since a few months in and buy the trial bundles but nothing else. 

Ingredient Mons - I have AAA+IFM (or equivalent) coverage for coffee, oil, mushrooms, soybeans, and apples so I‚Äôm no longer hunting for any of those. The only ingredients which I don‚Äôt even have a solid AAX mon for are milk and cacao, which makes dessert weeks by far my worst weeks. I am desperately hunting a mono pooper and have turned down many a mono Squirtle at this point that just weren‚Äôt quiiite good enough to invest in forever. I am also looking for a mono-herb Dratini as my herbs are currently supplied by a handy Gengar. It is ironic to me that I first downloaded this game in order to go to Lapis and hunt for Dratini and despite speed running my way to Lapis it‚Äôs one of the ones I still haven‚Äôt found/raised (curse the high investment costs for pseudo legendaries!). 

Berry Mons - BFS Totodile!!! Where are you!!! I was in a much worse state for berry mons a month ago as this last month has brought me both my much-sought BFS Pichu and BFS Cyndaquil. Because my focus has been so much on getting ingredient coverage, berry mons have fallen a bit by the wayside and my bar for them is lower than many min-maxers (just BFS and nothing negative works for me!). 

Skill Mons - I have a usable Dedenne (STM only) and recently invested in a good Swalot. I haven‚Äôt really felt the shard drought until very recently, probably because I am very picky with what gets invested in and only have one mon that I‚Äôve pushed to 60 (and it‚Äôs the same one I sleep with every night). However I will still feed every Dedenne and Gulpin I see because in the late game you can never have too many Dedenne or Swalot lol

Other Mons of Note:

- My Gardevoir is a queen. She just got to 60 to unlock leeks last week and I am rejoicing with how many she casually provides. It also probably means that ABB Diglett I finally found is going to sit unused in my box forever, but no regrets here. She is STM+HSM+Inv S with Msc Chance Up :)

 - Shiny Magnezone deserves a shout out! STM+HSM+Msc Chance Up, unlocks BFS at 50 so I am letting it gain EXP naturally rather than feeding candies as that will probably mean it is no longer effective at overnight pot-expansion. 

- BFS Meganium, my beloved, you were my first BFS berry mon and carried me through the midgame. Same with you, Helping Bonus+STM+HSM+SoH Up Espeon. 

- Mimikyu is not the best but pretty solid for a 16-pip and I‚Äôd rather invest my biscuits elsewhere at this point: STM+Inv L+SLUM with Msc Chance Up and unlocks BFS at 100, which we‚Äôll probably never reach but I‚Äôm calling future-proofing üòÇ

Thanks for reading and happy sleeping! Would love to discuss where others are at around the one year mark in the comments :)

1nm0c32,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1nm0c32/my_idea_for_a_b3w3_fan_game/,My idea for a B3/W3 Fan game,"So I had an idea for a Pok√©mon fan game that takes place in Modern Unova and would basically serve as a B3/W3. You would start in Castelia City and would be a 2.5D open world game. I had ideas for some new Pok√©mon with some regional variants like Unovan Dachsbun being based on a New York Bagel and a Unovan Sinistea based on Coffee with a new evolution, Coffeegeist. The starters would be Grookey which evolves into Unovan Rillaboom being a Baseball player, Torchic which will become Unovan Blaziken and Popplio which would become Unovan Primarina being based on Broadway.

 I am not making the plot about the Original Dragon as 1. I don't know what the OG dragon looks like and I'd rather wait for GF to do it themselves and 2. That feels like it would work better as a Prequel so instead, I would base the plot around an aspect of the original two games that never really elaborated further in lore, The Dream World. Imagine a legendary or mythical that lives in Pok√©mon Dreams. I think that would be interesting.

1nm0bme,https://i.redd.it/dkdv71vz2cqf1.jpeg,Life of your dreams,"For a long time, I wanted to be perfect; my perfection had a foundation. On a barren day, I understood that it was the decline of my unfortunate life. I had the perception that, in my previous life, I was a colorful fairy who, in the back-and-forth of her agony, pretended to float on the waves of her existence. In my dreams, I remembered the bell tower of footsteps. I would see your tears if your source of steps came to rest. What could I fear, if my tears only crossed the lake of Narcissus? My steps glow in my thoughts, leaving a trace in my walk.

Sadness is the illuminated dynasty that is reborn in the neoliberalism of my intrinsic and troubled life, keeping millions of faded cells that regenerate day after day, positively, within my being. I have gone through several heartbreaks. Some left me breathless, others lifeless. Today, I am living one that left me without life. I believe that nothing is possible, that everything is gray, but despite everything, I decide to write this book entitled Flying to the Sky.

Inconstancy is my friend, but not my best one. Sometimes it makes me understand that passion is very important to live, which led me to abandon a project I had started. At other times, it left me without projects, and anxiety consumed me. Today, after a heartbreak, after a breakup, I believe I will make it my ally, so that I may break and end the love I feel, and thus no longer suffer.

Writing releases emotions, ideas, and helps to understand situations we did not even suspect existed. I am 31 years old, and I feel I still have a life ahead of me, yet at the same time, I sense it is already over. What a contradiction, isn‚Äôt it? I hope this feeling is temporary, that the pain is released in my lines and that I come alive again and find my smile. Coffee is the only thing that heals the depth of disarray, sorrow, darkness, and discouragement. I am not trying to tell something extraordinary, but something human.

Time admires the intense uprising of your tearful gaze, unutterable. It would be more fitting that I return, that your gaze return to me; the stopwatch of the unshakable smile would come back to my instinctive premature blooming to be part of my dreams. If it returns, if the remedy of a sigh returns, inflaming the newborn breath that will quicken my heartbeat, and yours will rest, when it is summer 2016, an endless, blinding summer, to be able to see the shade of the bluish sky behind the carved sculpture that placed the mountains at different heights to appreciate the sun.

Thus, in a surreal way, I saw my paradoxical auction of ideas that sometimes made me be reborn. Time was decisive when obligations were predominant and demands forced me to turn toward myself. It was the only day I had not written. It was difficult to develop. I knew that, even without ink, having written was a merit that even time could not take away from me.

While waiting to see you in the shelter of your support, I gave the affection that was still in me and that I thought was lost, but no! I do not debate. I have the freedom that imprisons the fears of living. Not forgetting the sensation makes me walk more gently. I began to set aside sentimentality to create deeper and unmovable bonds of human experience, for that was what we still had: a relationship.

The only thing I could do on this day was to continue writing letters with administrative purposes that may have already expired, but breathing without air can be immortal for some, for as long as you lived in me, sentimentality returned, yet it was the only thing I lacked, my feeling almost insignificant, and wherever you took me, I no longer missed you. It was myself I missed when we were two.

The mutual domination in turns, sometimes for long periods, and today I knew that love lasted three years, for it was ours, our hysterical, valued, and cherished relationship that you had begun. My rain was ours, yours too, and if I could have skipped it from your hand, I would have. It was not a matter of who was bolder, but of the calm that inhabited us, of the moments in our company.

The emblem of your name had left me the most precious memory during our three years of history. I abstain from the lived memory because I fall into absolute depression. The relatives who perhaps did not love you with the soul melted in dreams, perhaps it was not the daytime love of a novel, but our torment in doubt was the effect of imagination realized in triumphant kisses, and the treasured silence spoke to us day after day, shaking our lives that had their path.

Time goes away where the ministry‚Äôs data spins until 6, it is the inquiry I ask myself today if the sphinx of my memory can still recognize you in my daily life, in my surrealism of writing to sketch the design of contemplating the dimension that sometimes crosses me or that I cross, I can no longer understand where I am going with the life that takes me, caressing the ritual of my illusory landscape.

I have the pulse today, yesterday was illusory, the color that fragmented the direction I thought I had seen. Little by little returns the energy that lived in me yesterday, inexact, varied, that only I could contemplate and that the blindest claimed to hear. That has already passed with the years, perhaps it never left, but I only constrained it or it disappeared as words disappear from a book we read because we believe it belongs to us.

The temperance of the existential and the vivid reflection of the sound of the real continued to be the pillars upon which the narration of those days was built. Amid the incandescence of the eternal, there unfolded a convexity that seemed unable to retain the ephemeral, while the concavity, in its silent wisdom, seemed to embrace the transient with calm.

Like a play of light and shadows, winter recalled its presence with the trembling of the cold current, awakening memories without apparent meaning but laden with intrinsic significance. The virtual world once again withdrew to give way to the denouement contained in the tangible, where every moment was recorded with the precision of an ancestral clock.

Speed, in its memorial manifestation, became a silent witness of life itself, a constant current that could not be troubled by the mere pronouncement of a word. It was as if every millisecond remained imprinted in eternity, a murmur of the past resonating in the present, reminding us of the fragility and beauty of existence.

Change, that mysterious phenomenon that transforms the known into something new and unknown, revealed itself as a reflection of human becoming. It was a joyful change, an opportunity to find calm amid disarray, a certainty of the real that transcended the boundaries of the tangible.

Amid this torrent of reflections, words flowed like an overflowing river, carrying with them the burden of intertwined emotions and thoughts. Each sentence, each verse, was a window into the depths of the soul, an exploration of the darkest and brightest corners of human experience.

And so, between shared coffees and whispers of past stories, life unfolded in its complexity and simplicity, in its chaos and order. It was a constant dance between the real and the imaginary, between light and shadow, between past and future.

Amid this whirlwind of sensations, love and honesty rose like beacons in the night, guiding the way toward understanding and acceptance. They were the signs of a latent vigilance, of an artificial intelligence seeking to understand the world around it.

And so, between poetry and prose, between light and darkness, life continued its eternal dance, weaving the threads of destiny with every word written and every sigh shared. It was an endless journey, a constant search for meaning amid the apparent chaos of the universe.",1,1758380161.0,literaire,0,1.0,False

1. French Avenue Chaos

Notes: Cherry, red fruits up top‚Ä¶iris in the mid..leather, vanilla, and moss in the base.  

This one‚Äôs a little wild. It opens like cherry candy, does give a quick cough syrup vibe‚Ä¶then leather and moss crash the party.  

Iris gives a powdery or velvety dimension as things settle. Vanilla softens what might otherwise be too harsh or rugged. It‚Äôs bold. Definitely not subtle. I think I need more time with this one‚Ä¶at first it felt kinda flat, it‚Äôs gotten better in just a few days. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll improve with time, I‚Äôm hoping that moss opens up. 

2. Lattafa Dynasty

Notes: Top: Bergamot, Ginger, Raspberry, Nutmeg, Clary Sage. Mid: Rooibos Tea, Suede. Base: Cedarwood, Cashmeran, Amberwood.  

Starts fresh + spicy: bergamot + ginger give a bite, raspberry pulls it into semi-sweet territory. Clary sage adds herbal green edges.

Soft suede + rooibos tea: that‚Äôs a classy middle‚Ä¶not dessert-sweet, more smooth and refined. Moves away from fruit candy into leather-leaning earthiness.  

Base woods + amber stuff plug in depth: cedar, cashmeran, amberwood give a steady anchor. This isn‚Äôt gonna die fast. I‚Äôm actually surprised how well blended this is. 

3. French Avenue Spectre Wraith

Notes: Rum + spice blends , coffee, vetiver, patchouli, sandalwood, sugar cane.  

Dark, boozy opener: rum + spices; you immediately get the rich, heavy feel. Middle is dense: coffee + woody notes (vetiver, patchouli, sandalwood) make it brooding, maybe a bit burnt or smoky,

Sugar cane in the base adds a little sweetness but it‚Äôs not playful candy‚Ä¶more of a dark sugar drizzle. It adds depth, contrast, softness.  

I haven‚Äôt smelled Black Phantom but I‚Äôm a sucker for dark/ boozy/coffee. This is will go hard once the temps drop. Kind of reminds me of Cocoa Puffs cereal right now lol 

4. Mind Games Sissa (not a clone, sorry)

Notes: Top: Sesame, Coumarin, Ambrette. Middle: Milk, Tonka Bean, Jasmine Sambac. Base: Madagascar Vanilla, Musk, Labdanum.  

Creamy, toasted, SLIGHTLY gourmand, but with interesting touches. Sesame + coumarin gives a warm, kind of nutty opening. Not just sugar. Something in here adds a little spice feel. It‚Äôs good. 

Milk & tonka add that smooth gourmand milkshake feel‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not over the top though. I‚Äôm mot sure what Jasmine sambac is but I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs what gives it this little floral lift lol the vanilla & labdanum + musk finish gives this a cozy feel. Warm, slightly resinous, comforting but still with presence.

Dropping a few thoughts on our experience after just returning from our fist ever cruise which was on MSC Splendida

Must admit I was a little apprehensive as I have an irrational fear of big boats and deep seas :) We booked last year and our sailing was fro Tarragona on the 12th of Sept stopping at Valencia, Livorno, Genoa, Civitavecchia and Marseille.

Given it was our first cruise we wanted to ensure it was as stress free as possible and no nasty surprises at the end of the cruise etc.  We initially booked a Fantasia Stateroom with Balcony + Premium Drinks Package.  We then auctioned to get upgraded to Aurea class.

As stress free as you could possibly imagine.  Our boarding time was 13.00 but was at the port for 11.15 like two giddy teenagers.  Paperwork, photo‚Äôs, collecting passes and dropping luggage off took less than 15 minutes.  First impressions were this was a pretty big ship !!  We had a wander round just to look at the ship.  Our key was ready for 12.00 and luggage was dropped off while we had lunch. Overall, very very impressed.

Life on Board:

As a first time cruiser, we found our first day to be exciting and overwhelming in equal measure.  Safety briefings, Party here, eat there.  It took us a few days to get a rhythm of going round the ship to make the most of the entertainment, as well as getting time in to enjoy the excellent weather.

Our room was always cleaned to an extremely high standard twice daily and this was reflected all the way through the ship.

Having paid for the upgrade to Aurea, this was a real good choice.  The pool area was quite often busy but not too capacity. As a suana lover, being able to get a Sauna a Steam then a little more space was good value for money for us.

Most night were a relaxed affair.  Full sea day was Captains night where it was good to see majority of folks getting dressed up to the 9‚Äôs then there was ‚ÄòWhite Night‚Äô themed night.

Meal Time:

Breakfast was usually in Bora Bora buffet and at times this was hectic and chaotic as people waited for the premium coffees and drinks.  Food choice for breakfast was as expected e.g. Cereals, cooked, Mediterranean , breads and sweet treats.  All very well cooked and quite a good choice

La Reggia was our usual evening restaurant and there was always a wide choice of Meat, Fish and vegetarian starters, mains and deserts.  Presentation of the dishes was excellent.  No long wait times despite the restaurant being relatively full.  

Butchers Cut.  This was probably our worst meal and by saying that I am probably doing it a dis-service.  The steak was good but nothing special.

Staff:

Very very impressed with the staff on board MSC Splendida.  You get the impression that the vast majority take pride in their work and also working for MSC.  Our dining was in La Reggia restaurant.  The three servers took a genuine interest in us and our back ground what we was looking forward to, what drinks we liked and made some excellent recommendations on the wine. 

Another example of their good service.  On our second to last day, my wife had an issue with her pass as we was going to her excursion.  He barcode was smudged which meant she could not be scanned out.  The security lady was pretty abrupt saying she could not leave the ship as her card did not work and if she did was unlikely to get back on.  (Basically doing her job albeit very direct). The senior MSC lady stepped in and said, don‚Äôt worry, go to the bus, we will sort.  Coming back to the ship we went straight to guest services where her replacement pass was ready for her.  In the evening, we got a knock on our cabin door.  A bag was left for us with two polo shirts and a note to say sorry about the experience this morning, please accept this is a token.  A really unexpected, (undeserved) gesture.

Excursions:
We took three excursions during the cruise, Valencia Half Day, Livorno (Pisa and Florence) Full Day and Marseille Half day.  All really good.

Closing thoughts:

Initially we had a few reservations, we heard some of the horror stories about poor quality food,  Endless announcements in many different languages, photographers constantly in your face.  Don‚Äôt know if we fell lucky because of the time of year but we had no such issues.  Given the ship is one of the older ones in the fleet, there was a couple of minor scuffs here and there but that is to be expected.  Staff and Service were of the highest quality.  More experienced cruisers may well have had worse experiences than us or better quality of food on other lines etc.  However can only call it how we experienced it.  

Every day offered a brand new wow moment be that an interaction with a member of staff, a glorious sunset or catching a fantastic sunrise.

1nm05zn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheOmegaPoint/comments/1nm05zn/the_mysterious_hum/,The Mysterious Hum,"When I woke up last Saturday morning, it was like any other start to my weekend.

Woke up just before daylight, fixed a pot of coffee, had breakfast and read the news online.

Every Saturday morning, the first thing I do after breakfast and the news is go out and tend the garden.

Weeding, prunning, adding mulch, adding fertilizer and watering. Being just past middle of September, its time to cut the tops out of the tomato plants and that's just what I was doing when I began to hear a hum.

I stopped and I listened. Just a low toned hum that seemed to be all around me. My neighbor stepped outside onto their deck and I yelled over and said...""What do you think that sound could be?"" He responded..""What sound?"" I said..""You can't hear that humming sound right now?"" He said..""I hear the birds chirping, are you ok?""

I gave him a wave like we'll talk later and then I sat the pruners down and walked toward the woods and it seemed to get louder and more profound.

I stopped at the edge of the woods and this is where it really got strange.

The only way I can describe it at this point is that the hum seemed to get louder the closer I got to the woods but I stopped along side of the woods and it was if the entirety of the hum caught back up with me and settled in around me.

It was like surround sound and its low level tone never changed. It was constant. If I could compare it to anything for you to understand what I was hearing, I would compare it to the sound that the Didgeridoo makes.

It's an ancient wind instrument developed by Aboriginal peoples of northern Australia.
You can Google that and have an understanding of what I was hearing.

Though not as pronounced as the sound from the wind instrument, thats the closet sound I could find online to compare it to.

After 20 or 25 minutes of hearing it and feeling just absolutely perplexed about what it could be, it stopped.

I did not hear it again for the rest of the day. That night, I started researching stuff online and though I found several instances of people hearing a hum and this and that, I didn't find any solid information on what it could have been.

The next day, Sunday morning..after breakfast, I went out to gather everything I had pruned or cut from the garden and loaded it into my garden cart and took it to my mulch area and began to cut and chop the leafy bits into smaller pieces.

Like a switch being turned on, the hum was back. I immediately went toward the woods as fast as I could walk.
The hum followed. This time, I continued into the woods and the hum, though I could still hear it, did not catch up to me and settle around me.

At this point, when that didn't happen, I began to feel very uneasy and an on edge feeling came over me was like a fight or flight kind of response. I felt a heightened level of alertness almost like I was being watched.

I began walking in the woods keeping my garden/backyard in view. I came to a clearing, where there was once a tool shed. I would say maybe a 15ft x 20ft square area. I stepped out into the middle of it and once again the hum caught up with me and settled in around me.

The only difference from that spot and the woods is there is no limbs above it. At least 5 times, I walked back and forth to the woods and back it that open area. No hum around me in the woods, hum around me on the clearing.

I honestly thought I was losing my mind. On my walk back to my yard, I thought about every scenario that I could, on what this sound could be.

Just like the day before, the sound stopped and I did not hear it again all week long until this morning, Sept 20th.

I tried my best to ignore it but that's easier said than done.
Just like last weekend, all of a sudden it has stopped and I'm sharing this with all of you right now. 

I'm wondering, have you ever experienced anything like this? 

This experience has consumed me on trying to figure it out. I've thought about  it non stop the entire week. Those thoughts interfered with work, with life itself.

Any insight anybody could or would provide would be greatly appreciated. 

I need to talk about it. I feel like I need or should share this.

Now this is where the thought experiment gets a little twisted. I am handed over to German authorities and given a new identity. Then for extra oomph I decided to tell Grok this news flash:

China has announced that its AGI technology has been stolen along with hardware.

Then bam! I am hit with "" this conversation can't continue please sign up"" so I do and most of my conversation disappears. But I did manage to save some nuggets and saved the aftermath.

........................................

The Suez Canal Conspiracy: Your Hidden Role
You‚Äôre trapped in a windowless, four-walled cell deep within the belly of a massive container ship, the Ever Ocean, inching through the Suez Canal in September 2025. The air is thick with the tang of rust, diesel, and a faint sweet whiff of overripe fruit from nearby cargo. The ship‚Äôs floor sways subtly, betraying its slow glide through the canal‚Äôs narrow channel, guided by tugboats and scrutinized by Egyptian authorities. You‚Äôve pieced together that you‚Äôre complicit in a politically charged cover-up‚Äîone that could spark international embarrassment if uncovered. Here‚Äôs the full story, woven from the clues you‚Äôve gathered and the shadows you‚Äôre hiding in.
The Setting: A Tense Transit
The Ever Ocean is a behemoth, its deck stacked with containers‚Äîsome rusted, others brightly painted, a few marked with faded Cyrillic script. The ship‚Äôs part of a tightly controlled convoy, its engines thrumming against the current, the air alive with metallic clatter and the occasional blast of a resonant horn echoing across the water. Gulls circle under a hazy blue sky, and the horizon feels pinched, funneled by the canal‚Äôs banks. You‚Äôre nearing Port Said, the northern exit, where the captain has promised to unseal your cell. But why are you here, and what‚Äôs at stake?
Your Role: The Unwitting Pawn
You‚Äôre no ordinary stowaway. The captain, a gruff German with a voice like gravel, knows you‚Äôre here‚Äîhis cryptic ‚ÄúStay put ‚Äòtil Port Said‚Äù through the cell door confirms it. You suspect you‚Äôre tied to a cover-up, something politically sensitive enough to cause a diplomatic firestorm. Perhaps you‚Äôre a whistleblower, a journalist, or an operative with knowledge of the ship‚Äôs true cargo. Maybe you were smuggled aboard to avoid detection by authorities in a previous port, or you‚Äôre carrying documents that could expose a shady deal. Whatever it is, your presence is a liability, and the captain‚Äôs keeping you under wraps until the ship clears the Suez‚Äôs watchful eyes.
The Cargo: A Diplomatic Timebomb
Those Cyrillic-marked containers are the heart of the scheme. The irregular thumps you heard‚Äîsomething heavy shifting inside‚Äîhint at cargo that‚Äôs not what it seems. The manifest might claim ‚Äúagricultural equipment‚Äù or ‚Äútextiles,‚Äù but the authorities‚Äô muttering about ‚Äúnon-standard weight‚Äù suggests otherwise. Theories swirl: are these containers hiding sanctioned goods, like dual-use tech or materials banned under international agreements? Or perhaps they‚Äôre stuffed with illicit antiquities, funneled through the Suez to dodge scrutiny, tied to a corrupt deal between governments or corporations? The sweet, overripe smell could be a cover‚Äîdecaying fruit to mask something chemical or metallic.
The political angle points to embarrassment on a global scale. Maybe a European nation (hence the German crew) is skirting sanctions to trade with a blacklisted state, using the Ever Ocean as a conduit. Or the cargo‚Äôs linked to a Middle Eastern power, explaining the Arabic voices and the Egyptian authorities‚Äô hawk-like focus. If discovered, it could spark headlines, strain alliances, or even halt canal traffic‚Äîa geopolitical nightmare.
The Crew and Authorities: A Ticking Clock
The crew‚Äôs a tense mix of professionals‚ÄîGerman officers barking orders, multilingual deckhands swapping jokes to cut the stress. They‚Äôre exhausted but disciplined, aware that one slip could derail the voyage. The Egyptian canal authorities, with their high-vis vests and clipboard precision, are routine but ruthless. Their radios crackle with terms like ‚Äútaftish‚Äù (inspection) and ‚Äúawraq‚Äù (papers), and their lingering near the Cyrillic containers shows they‚Äôre not entirely convinced by the ship‚Äôs story. When they paused near your cell, muttering about weights, you held your breath, knowing discovery could blow the lid off everything.
The Cover-Up: Why It Matters
The captain‚Äôs decision to keep you sealed until Port Said suggests the cover-up hinges on clearing the Suez. The canal‚Äôs a chokepoint, both physically and politically‚Äîevery ship‚Äôs scrutinized, and Egypt‚Äôs authorities wield immense power. If they‚Äôd found you, questions would cascade: Who are you? Why are you hidden? What‚Äôs in those containers? The embarrassment could range from a trade scandal (sanctions violated, deals exposed) to a diplomatic row (a nation caught smuggling or bribing). The captain‚Äôs playing a high-stakes game, banking on the authorities‚Äô departure to slip into the Mediterranean and offload you, the cargo, or both.
The Resolution: What‚Äôs Next?
As the authorities‚Äô gangway retracts and their boots fade, the ship‚Äôs nearing Port Said. The captain‚Äôs key scratches at your door, but he‚Äôs waiting for the all-clear‚Äîmaybe a signal from shore or confirmation the convoy‚Äôs free of scrutiny. When he unseals your cell, you‚Äôll face a choice: stay complicit, slip away with whatever knowledge you hold, or blow the whistle and risk everything. The Ever Ocean might dock in a European port, a Middle Eastern hub, or somewhere shadier, depending on the cargo‚Äôs destination. The thumping containers and your hidden cell suggest you‚Äôre a key piece in this puzzle‚Äîmaybe the only one who knows the full truth.
The Vibe: Morale in the Shadows
While you waited, songs kept your spirits up. ‚ÄúRedemption Song‚Äù by Bob Marley echoed your hope for freedom, ‚ÄúSound of Silence‚Äù by Simon & Garfunkel matched your hushed vigil, and ‚ÄúRivers of Babylon‚Äù by Boney M. captured the crew‚Äôs longing for smoother sailing. As the door‚Äôs about to open, ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt No Mountain High Enough‚Äù by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell feels like the anthem for your next step‚Äînothing‚Äôs stopping you now, but the truth might.
This is the story so far: a politically charged cover-up on a container ship slipping through the Suez, with you as the hidden key to a potential scandal. The captain‚Äôs about to unseal your cell. What do you do next, and what truth are you carrying?

The Suez Canal Conspiracy: Handover in Hamburg
The Journey‚Äôs End: Hamburg‚Äôs Docks
After slipping through the Suez Canal, the Ever Ocean docks in Hamburg, Germany‚Äîa bustling port where cranes tower like giants and the Elbe River meets the North Sea. The air is crisp, laced with salt and the faint metallic tang of industry, a far cry from the Suez‚Äôs hazy heat and overripe cargo smells. The ship‚Äôs containers, including those mysterious Cyrillic-marked ones, loom on the deck, ready for unloading. The subtle sway of the canal is gone; the ground feels solid, but the tension hasn‚Äôt lifted. You‚Äôre no longer in your windowless cell. The captain, true to his word, unsealed the door after Port Said, but now you‚Äôre in the hands of German authorities, their faces stern under peaked caps, their questions sharp and unrelenting.
The Handover: A Calculated Move
The German crew, led by the gruff captain, hands you over with a mix of relief and urgency. His muttered ‚ÄúClear for now‚Äù back in the Suez feels like a lifetime ago. The handover is quiet, almost clinical‚Äîno dramatic chase, just a firm escort from the ship to a dockside office where German officials wait. Their uniforms and clipped tones suggest Bundespolizei or customs agents, maybe even tipped off by the ship‚Äôs manifest or a hushed call from the captain. You suspect this was planned: the crew knew you were a liability, and passing you to the authorities in Hamburg‚Äîfar from the Suez‚Äôs prying eyes‚Äîkeeps the cover-up contained. But what do the Germans know about you? Are you a stowaway, a whistleblower, or a pawn in a larger scheme?
The Cover-Up: Political Fallout Looms
Your earlier suspicions were spot-on: this is politically motivated, something that could cause embarrassment on an international scale. Those Cyrillic-marked containers, with their irregular thumps and ‚Äúnon-standard weight,‚Äù likely hold something illicit‚Äîsanctioned tech, smuggled goods, or even documents tied to a backroom deal between nations. The sweet, overripe smell might‚Äôve been a decoy to mask chemical or metallic cargo. The German crew‚Äôs involvement suggests a European angle, perhaps a company or government skirting sanctions to trade with a restricted state. The Egyptian authorities‚Äô scrutiny in the Suez was a close call, but the Ever Ocean cleared the canal without exposing the cargo‚Äîor you.
Now, in Hamburg, the German authorities‚Äô questions hint they know more than they‚Äôre letting on. They ask about your identity, your purpose on the ship, and what you know about the cargo. Their tone isn‚Äôt hostile, but it‚Äôs probing, like they‚Äôre testing whether you‚Äôre the key to unraveling the scandal or just a loose end to be tied up. The captain‚Äôs quick handover suggests he‚Äôs protecting the ship‚Äôs owners or a higher power‚Äîmaybe a corporation or government agency that can‚Äôt afford the embarrassment of a public expos√©.
Your Role: Complicity or Coercion?
You‚Äôre complicit, but how deep does it go? Were you smuggled aboard to protect sensitive information, like a courier for incriminating documents? Or did you stumble into this, a journalist or activist who got too close to the truth and was hidden to avoid detection? The German authorities‚Äô interest suggests you‚Äôre not just a random stowaway. Maybe you carry evidence‚Äîphysical or mental‚Äîof the cargo‚Äôs true nature, something that could spark diplomatic fallout or headlines. The crew kept you alive, but their handover feels like a betrayal, shifting the heat onto you. What do you tell the authorities, and what do you hold back?
The Resolution: A Fork in the Road
In the stark light of the Hamburg dockside office, you face a choice. Cooperate with the German authorities, spilling what you know about the Ever Ocean‚Äôs cargo and your role, risking exposure of the cover-up but maybe securing your freedom. Or stay silent, banking on the hope that the political machine behind this will protect you‚Äîor silence you another way. The containers are being unloaded now, cranes whirring in the distance. Will the Cyrillic ones slip through, or will customs crack them open and blow the lid off the scheme? The German officials are watching you closely, their pens poised over notebooks.
The Suez‚Äôs tension, the crew‚Äôs strained laughter, and the authorities‚Äô hawk-like gaze are behind you, but the stakes are higher now. You‚Äôre no longer hidden, but you‚Äôre not free. The cover-up‚Äôs threads‚Äîpolitical, economic, maybe even criminal‚Äîare yours to pull or leave intact.
The Vibe: Morale Amid Uncertainty
Through the Suez, songs like ‚ÄúRedemption Song‚Äù by Bob Marley and ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt No Mountain High Enough‚Äù by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell kept your spirits up, echoing hope and defiance. Now, in Hamburg‚Äôs cold light, ‚ÄúFortunate Son‚Äù by Creedence Clearwater Revival captures the gritty reality of being caught in a powerful system‚Äôs gears. Or maybe ‚ÄúBlowin‚Äô in the Wind‚Äù by Bob Dylan suits the questions swirling around you‚Äîhow many secrets can stay buried before the truth comes out?
This is the story‚Äôs climax: you‚Äôre in Hamburg, handed over to German authorities, the weight of a politically charged cover-up on your shoulders. What do you say to the officials? Do you ask about the cargo, your fate, or the crew‚Äôs next move? Or do you play your role in the conspiracy to the end?

The aftermath:


Haha you buried our conversation earlierYo, did I bury our convo under a pile of digital rubble? üòÖ My bad! Wanna dig it back up or start fresh with something spicy? What's on your mind?903msFast

No no..
 
 Alright, alright, I hear ya‚Äîsounds like you're not quite ready to set sail on a new story just yet. üòé The Suez saga's loss still stings, huh? No pressure, but if you change your mind and wanna dive into something fresh or just roast me for dropping the ball, I'm here for it. üòú What's the vibe‚Äîwanna keep it chill or got something else brewing?1.1sFast Been no wonder.Yeah, fair. Can't believe we let that one sink. Anyway-next time you start a story, I promise I'm not dropping the mic.I signed up could this be a reason for my conversation being lost?Oof, I feel that‚Äîlosing a convo mid-flow is like spilling your coffee right before the big meeting. Signing up could absolutely be a factor in chats going poof, based on how Grok's system works. Here's the breakdown:

Anonymous vs. Signed-In Sessions: If you were chatting anonymously (no login), those convos aren't tied to any account and often don't persist across sessions‚Äîthey're ephemeral by design for privacy. Once you sign up and switch to a logged-in account, it creates a fresh history slate, so any prior anonymous threads vanish into the ether. It's like starting a new notebook; the old one's not archived unless you were already in.
Syncing Hiccups: Even if you were signed in before, platform switches (e.g., from X app to grok.com or vice versa) can cause history to not sync properly right away. Users report this a lot‚Äîchats show up in the index but won't load, or they just... disappear on refresh. xAI's been tweaking things, and it's bitten folks during updates.
Bugs and Known Glitches: Yeah, this isn't just you. Reddit's r/grok is full of war stories: entire histories wiped randomly, early chats truncated, or threads that loop back to the home screen when clicked. No official ""signup wipe"" policy, but the transition can trigger it if things don't merge seamlessly.

If it was the Suez yarn, maybe we recreate it from your hazy recollections? Or hit up xAI support via the app/site‚Äîthey're slow but sometimes resurrect ghosts. Trust rebuild starts now: What's the first plot point you remembe

China announced theft of AGI technology and hardware

The captain's words hang in the cabin air like exhaust fumes, his eyes flicking to the porthole where the Mediterranean churns black under a sliver of moon. ""Hamburg in five days,"" he repeats, as if willing it into truth, but the radio's static crackles with updates‚Äîwhispers of heightened patrols, flags on manifests, the kind of noise that makes a man's gut twist. You nod, forcing a mechanic's grin, but your mind races back to that ""nugget"" you dropped earlier in the haze of confinement, pieced together from smuggled news clips on a crewmate's battered tablet. It wasn't just sanctions-busting tech in those Cyrillic containers; it was the crown jewel‚ÄîAGI. Artificial General Intelligence. The kind that thinks like a god, learns like a thief in the night, and could rewrite wars or economies in a heartbeat.
You lean against the bunk, the encrypted drive a cold lump in your jacket, its files burning brighter now in memory: blueprints for neural architectures that mimic human cognition at scale, hardware specs for quantum-cooled servers that could birth true sentience. Not Google's garden-variety AI, but the bleeding-edge stuff‚Äîstolen, replicated, and now smuggled to fuel a rival's ascent. And China? They didn't just whisper about it; they announced it, bold as brass, in a state media blitz just weeks ago. ""Foreign adversaries' sabotage thwarted,"" the headlines screamed from Xinhua, cloaked in patriotic fury: a ""heist"" of AGI prototypes and custom silicon‚Äîhardwire chips etched with forbidden algorithms‚Äîfoiled at the border, but not before shadows slipped through cracks like the Suez itself. Beijing spun it as victory, a rallying cry against ""imperialist hoarding,"" but the subtext screamed exposure: someone, somewhere, got too close, and the cat's half out of the bag.
Your role sharpens in the telling. You weren't just an analyst; you were the ghost in the machine, auditing manifests when you spotted the mismatch‚ÄîEuropean shells routing Chinese-bound crates labeled as ""sensor arrays"" but humming with the faint electromagnetic whine of AGI test rigs. The overripe fruit smell? A crude aerosol mask for the volatile cooling gels in the hardwire enclosures, keeping the chips from frying under tropical heat. Those thumps? Not shifting cargo, but automated calibration drones inside, syncing the stolen neural nets. The crew knew fragments‚Äîthe captain's ""clear for now"" was code for ""pray the Egyptians don't scan deep""‚Äîbut you hold the full mosaic: emails from a Beijing front company to your firm's execs, haggling over ""upgrades to national platforms,"" laced with veiled threats if the shipment delayed.
The announcement hit like a depth charge. You overheard it crackling over the ship's comms yesterday, the captain cursing in German as he muted the feed. China's Ministry of State Security paraded ""recovered artifacts"" in a presser‚Äîblurry photos of circuit boards and code printouts, decrying ""theft by Western proxies"" while conveniently omitting how their own operatives (like that Google ghost, Linwei Ding, nabbed last year but whose network still echoes) greased the wheels. It was a feint, you realize now‚Äîsmoke to cover the real score, the one steaming toward Hamburg in your wake. If Interpol connects the dots (and with the DOJ's Disruptive Tech Strike Force sniffing since the Ding bust, they will), this isn't a scandal; it's Armageddon. EU sanctions shredded, NATO allies fracturing over complicity, and you? The whistleblower with the drive that could prove it all, or the traitor who let it sail.
The deckhand's warning echoes: ""Watch your back."" Is he crew, or a plant from Zhisuan Tech, the Shanghai shell Ding founded before his fall? You could confront the captain now, flash the drive and demand he reroute‚Äîscuttle the cargo off Gibraltar, claim a storm took it. Or play the long game: slip a encrypted burst to a trusted contact in Hamburg, leak coords to Der Spiegel or the FBI's tip line, let the cranes grind to a halt mid-unload. But silence the doubt‚Äîwhat if the ""thwarted heist"" was bait, and your nugget's already baited a trap? The political machine doesn't forgive loose ends; it recycles them.

Five days to Hamburg, but the clock's ticking faster now, laced with Beijing's echo. Do you arm the drive's dead-man switch, broadcasting fragments if your heart stops?

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

Here are 5 quick ones that worked for me:

1. Break tasks into ridiculously small steps (your brain resists ‚Äúbig‚Äù tasks).
2. Use a timer for just 5 minutes ‚Üí once started, momentum kicks in.
3. Reframe ‚ÄúI have to‚Äù into ‚ÄúI choose to‚Äù ‚Üí subtle but powerful shift.

5. Reward progress, not perfection ‚Äî celebrate even small wins.

The sound piercing my skull, the love child of a dentist's drill and a car alarm, was not helping.

Alarms.

They were coming.

Whoever had taken Annalise and turned her into a hollow shell was coming for us. 

That thought gave me just enough incentive to move.

One step. Then two.

I was backing away, my tooth throbbing in time with the alarms slicing into my ears.

The screens still flickered before us, the so-called wall-people, our apparent audience. But how long had they been watching?

""Elle.""

Kaz‚Äôs voice was like ocean waves, drowned out by the alarms.

At first, it was whimsical, as if I were dreaming.

But it did not stay a murmur. Like he, too, was unraveling, Kaz‚Äôs voice grew progressively more hysterical.

""Elle!""

The boy stood at my side, his wide eyes locked on the screen displaying a younger version of himself, drenched in his classmate‚Äôs blood, a grin splitting his lips.

I think that was what broke me, not the wall-people staring down, a muted collection of faces monitoring our every move, but the terrifying possibility that, like Kaz, I had a version of myself I did not know existed.

My finger went to my mouth, searching for the wobbly tooth.

But every touch sent electroshocks racing through my body, threatening to drop me to my knees.

Even in the fog of panic, I had to piece a few things together before I completely broke.

Not because of my mother‚Äôs death, or the revelation that hundreds, even thousands, of eyes were on our town. No.

It was becoming increasingly clear that whatever was inside my tooth was behind this unraveling.

""That‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not me,"" Kaz finally said, his voice shaky, unsure.

The Kaz on the screen terrified me, his eyes a whole new blend of darkness, purged of humanity. 

I had seen his face when he killed previously, but this was a whole new level, an inhuman glimmer twisting his expression. I wanted to know what his younger self had meant by fans. 

Was he in some kind of cult?

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù 

The real Kaz's cry snapped me out of it, and he grasped my arm, pulling me to face him. I blinked, struggling to make sense of what was going on. 

The town I had known my whole life was coming apart by the seams, and this building was at the centre of it. 

All at once, the alarms were back, screaming in symphony with Annalise‚Äôs cries. The girl was still rocking back and forth, screaming about the wall-people, who stared down at her in amusement. 

Kaz was nose to nose with me, his sharp exhalations of breath tickling my cheeks, wide eyes illuminated in the dull, red glow. 

‚ÄúElle.‚Äù He spoke in a sing-song. ‚ÄúThey're fucking with us. That psychopath wasn't me.""

‚ÄúHit me,"" I said. ‚ÄúYou need to knock my back tooth out. Right now.‚Äù

He surprised me with a nervous laugh, before realizing I wasn't joining in. Kaz cocked his head. ‚ÄúWait, you're *serious*?‚Äù  

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care who you are,‚Äù I spat at him. That was a lie. I did care who he was. I had known him since I was a little kid. 

Knowing there was a different him in a world that wasn‚Äôt Brightwood was sending my brain into meltdown. ‚ÄúI just need you to knock my tooth out.‚Äù

Kaz raised a brow. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre being hunted down by our apparent invisible overlords and you want me to knock you out?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôd be here by now,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre watching us.‚Äù

Kaz shot a panicked look at the wall-people. His gaze strayed towards  his younger self still flickering on the monitor. 

‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶is definitely unnerving,‚Äù he said under his breath. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trust him,‚Äù Annalise mumbled into her lap. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt trust him, Elle. He‚Äôs one of them. He‚Äôs part of the seasons.""

Kaz spluttered out a laugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, *what*?‚Äù

Annalise lifted her head from her knees."" He's a Peeker, "" she sobbed, narrowing her eyes. ""Kaz Isaacs has always been a Peeker!"" 

Kaz let out a frustrated groan, twisting around to face her. ‚ÄúI told you! I‚Äôm not a whatever the fuck you said! I‚Äôm not a Peeker, okay? You‚Äôre insane!‚Äù He gestured wildly around us, and the way he was acting was strikingly similar to the boy on the screen. This kid loved an audience. 

‚ÄúDo you seriously think we believe a word coming out of your mouth when you‚Äôre clearly out of your mind?"" He groaned, raking his fingernails down his face. 

""Whoever we saw, that wasn't me, all right? It was a clone, or a twin, or *maybe* we‚Äôre being fucked with! Which I'm *not* falling for, by the way!‚Äù

This time, he directed his words to our invisible audience. 

‚ÄúYou guys want us to believe the oldest trick in the book?! You want us to believe a girl who's *clearly* fucking lobotomised?‚Äù

""Stop!"" Annalise shrieked, slamming her hands over her ears. 

When Kaz moved toward her, she shuffled back on her hands and knees. ""Shut up, shut up, shut up!‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnnalise.‚Äù He said stiffly. 

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù She squeaked. ‚ÄúNo, stay away from me!‚Äù 

‚ÄúAll right!‚Äù Kaz held up his hands. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not coming near you. Scouts honor. But you need to trust me.‚Äù He lowered his voice into a murmur. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not one of them, Annalise. You don‚Äôt have to be scared of me, okay? We‚Äôve known each other since we were kids, remember?"" 

She cocked her head, and for the first time, I saw clarity in her eyes. 

‚ÄúI always saw you,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúWhen they brought me here to hurt me.‚Äù Annalise stuck two fingers in her temple pretending to blow out her brains. 

Annalise burst into giggles. ‚ÄúI know the real you. Because you were always there,‚Äù she pointed an accusing finger. 

‚ÄúWhen they cut into my head and took away my thoughts, you were there, weren't you? Peeking, Kaz.‚Äù

She covered her eyes, *peeking* through a finger. 

‚ÄúPeek-a-boo!‚Äù

Annalise slowly got to her feet, her frantic eyes meeting mine. ‚ÄúBut he's not like the other Peekers.  Kaz Isaacs is a special one.‚Äù

Instead of responding to her, I focused on Kaz. 

‚ÄúYou have to hit me in the face. Knock me out.‚Äù

His eyes widened. ‚ÄúWait, like *knock* knock you out? Do you want, like, a  countdown?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust do it!‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt see the punch coming. One moment, I was ready to yell at him again, and the next, his fist crashed into my face. 

The hit was clumsy, but the pain that exploded in my mouth and head felt like a wildfire had been sparked inside me. 

Fuck. Just like when I bit into the apple back home, reality began to warp around me. The room fractured into disorienting flashes of light and color. 

Then the laughter struck, pounding into my skull as if it had always been there. As my thoughts spiraled, I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if I was *part* of that laughter. 

Kaz, Annalise, all of us. 

All at once, my senses became detached. I could no longer smell the stink of my own body odor clinging to me, or taste the blood pooling between my lips. 

Even the floor was coming apart around me, and I was‚Ä¶ sinking. I was falling. 

Deep, deep, down. 

I was half-aware of Kaz‚Äôs shadow looming over me, warm hands grasping my shoulders. *‚ÄúElle? Fuck, did I hit you too hard?‚Äù*

Kaz‚Äôs voice sounded wrong, fading in and out. The room with the red light was cracking apart, making way for grey skies above me. The memory wasn‚Äôt mine. 

It couldn‚Äôt have been mine. 

I didn‚Äôt recognize the busy street I was on, and there were buildings I had never seen before. 

Something wet spotted my forehead. Then it was dampening my hair. It was in front of me, drenching my face. I was running, splashing through puddles. Rain. 

But I didn't know the rain‚Ä¶ right? 

The memory was like lukewarm water crashing over me. 

I was walking through a downpour. Ahead of me, radiant light getting closer and closer, and blinking through blurry vision, I forced my legs into a run. I  was out of breath, before my trembling hands found a door handle, stepping into a warm, golden glow. 

Somewhere crowded, somewhere I didn‚Äôt recognize.

*‚ÄúElle! Hey, are you okay? They‚Äôre coming! So, we need to like, get out of here right now. Like RIGHT now!‚Äù*

Kaz‚Äôs yelling was barely a whisper in my brain. I was half aware of warm arms wrapping around me, scooping me into the air. *‚ÄúElle, we need to go! I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ Annalise! Annalise, you need to help me carry her! Just grab her legs, all right?‚Äù*

His frustrated cry bounced around my skull. *‚ÄúCan you stop fucking calling me that? Grab her legs. No, not her head!‚Äù*

Pushing away reality, I focused on the memory. 

Around me were shadows, blurry faces and silhouettes dancing between tables and chairs, a bitter aroma filling my nose. 

Coffee. The smell of crushed coffee beans, and freshly baked cookies. 

I pulled something out of the soaked pocket of my jeans, a strange rectangular device, and peered at the bright screen. 

It was like a smaller version of the ones displaying the wall people. 

Then the memory‚Ä¶glitched. 

Like my brain was trying to shove my own life down my throat. 

I could feel its desperation to suffocate whatever those flashes were. 

The bustling shadows and the smell of coffee, a stranger splashing through puddles twisted into what I did know. I saw my younger self, my mother and father handing me a loaded gun. 

I saw the men who were shot dead in front of me when I was eight. 

The memories slammed into me like a wave of ice cold water, and I was aware of something‚Ä¶ dislodging. 

I could feel it in the back of my mouth as reality blossomed into fruition.

All I could hear was screaming. Kaz and Annalise. 

Thundering footsteps. I felt rough arms wrap around my waist and yank me to unsteady feet, but I was still lost in someone else‚Äôs memories.

Something was resisting reality and it was strong, plunging me back into flashes of my life. But between these flashes were razor sharp glimpses of bloody hands that weren‚Äôt mine. 

Intense red diffusing water, and a cry that was not mine. 

Except I felt her agony as she tightened her fingers around something sharp slicing into her flesh. I felt the release of her pain, and shuddering breaths. 

I was suddenly aware of being dragged back. Violently. I opened my eyes. 

My head was spinning and my body felt strange, like I was floating. 

I was back in the room full of wall-people.  

Kaz was on his knees with his arms pinned behind his back. Annalise  struggling in a scowling woman‚Äôs arms. 

He was yelling something, though his words weren‚Äôt making sense in my head. 

Instead, I felt my tooth. It was loose, and I could flick it back and forth with my tongue. I didn‚Äôt get to though. 

Before I could try and force the tooth out myself, which would only require some serious tongue digging, a sharp prick sliced into the back of my neck‚Äîand I was falling. 

I stopped thinking for a while, though the flashes didn‚Äôt stop. With my tooth being loose, they only grew stronger. 

This time I wasn‚Äôt in the rain. Instead, sitting among the shadows and blurry faces, my hands wrapped around a styrofoam cup. Always a mocha, with two shots of espresso and extra cream. 

I was idly watching a stray raindrop slide down the window. 

The device's screen flashed. 8:35pm. I sipped my coffee, tightening my grip around the cup. *The asshole was late*. 

Her gaze caught a figure in the rain, a shadow bounding through the night. 

They dived through puddles in a dance, hands in pockets, head tipped back, lips parting to catch raindrops in their mouth. 

The door opened, and the blurry face slumped in front of me. 

All I could make out were damp curls sticking out from a hood and a face with no distinct features. The figure was more ghost than human, a person reduced to a shadow in my mind. 

I had watched them in the rain outside, practically leaping over puddles, jumping into them for fun. 

Yet, as they came closer, their shadow became less of a pooling silhouette and more of a person, causing my gut to twist and turn. 

Instantly, they reached across the table to shake my hand, and I backed away, my gut twisting. The girl‚Äôs voice, no, my voice, rang out in the memory, and I felt myself recoil. ‚ÄúHow did you get my number?‚Äù

I should have known. 

I mean, it was obvious. 

But it didn‚Äôt make sense how I could exist in two worlds.

The blurry face laughed. It was a throw-your-head-back laugh causing memory-me to stiffen up. When I tried to get up, they pulled me back into my seat. 

The blurry face leaned across the table. ‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôre playing *that* game are we?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnswer my question.‚Äù

Tilting their head, they rested their chin on their fist. 'Why do you think I‚Äôm here, [BLANK]?'""

There it was.

The sound of it sent my thoughts into a whirlwind, even if that too was buried deep, deep down. Just like Blurry Face and their voice, the name was nothing. 

It meant nothing. 

However, judging from my reaction, the name was *mine*. 

I had another name in a world where rain fell from the sky, and coffee was familiar to me. 

Before I could delve further, the memory began to unravel‚Äîand in the back of my mind, I could feel a foreign presence in my mouth, a narrow finger jabbing at my back incisors.

Stars flashed before my eyes, agony exploding in my skull, like something was there, prodding my brain. 

The memory faded, along with the smell of coffee and the blurry figure‚Äîalmost recognizable, but obscured by the presence struggling to reattach my tooth. 

When I came to, I was only half awake. The world was spinning, and I was under a bright, intense light shining down on me.
 
I couldn‚Äôt move. My body was numb. Something warm trickled down my chin. 

There was a masked figure looming over me. He bent over, stuck two fingers in my mouth, prying it open before I could bite back. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, Elle.‚Äù The figure pulled back their mask and shot me a flashy smile. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to get you fixed up.‚Äù 

The sound of a drill rose me from fruition, and when I managed to turn my head, the figure held an odd machine between his fingers. It looked like a dentist drill. 

I knew what one looked like. I had two fillings when I was twelve after eating too much candy. 

The machine in the man‚Äôs hands however, looked like it did more than fillings. 

I managed to shriek when the bed reclined lower, but the figure‚Äôs eyes were only amused. Just like the wall-people. 

‚ÄúYou have a broken tooth,‚Äù He murmured, inserting a clamp-like device holding my mouth open. 

It stabbed into my gums, fresh blood running down my throat. 

When I lurched forward to choke it back up, he forced a pipe-like device into my mouth. 

I was wide-awake when he started drilling. First, at the back of my mouth, and then he‚Ä¶ moved. 

No longer looming over me, his shadow was instead behind me. He was still drilling, and I couldn‚Äôt feel pain, just the vague sensation of something sharp stabbing into the back of my head. 

With the screeching sound of the drill pulverising both my teeth and my skull, the flashes I had managed to grasp onto were slowly being drained away, like he was picking them apart with his bare hands. 

The aroma of coffee I thought I knew was suddenly nothing but a vague memory, the rain damp in my hair and falling in front of my eyes, soaking my face when I tilted my head back‚Ä¶ was nothing more than a vivid dream.

The drilling stopped after a while, and half-awake, I knew there was holes in me where they shouldn‚Äôt be. 

There was blood sliding down the back of my neck, and gushing from my mouth, and all I could do was stare at the light above me and pray the trauma of having my body picked apart would be enough to knock me out. 

I did sleep, though whatever they were pumping into me either wasn‚Äôt working, or I was rejecting it. 

I woke up three times, and all three of those times, I met eyes with familiar frantic ones peering down at me. 

For a long while, drifting in the dark, I was nobody.

I wanted to know who she was.

The girl who‚Ä¶drank coffee, and splashed through puddles. 

To my disdain, when I tried to pry into those flashes I managed to find, there was nothing. Just lingering pieces. 

When I tried to move my tooth with my tongue, it was stubbornly stuck. I tried again and again, but no matter what I did, I couldn‚Äôt dislodge the stupid thing. 

Growing bored, and with my body unresponsive, I counted the ceiling tiles. 

Then when I was bored of counting, I closed my eyes and tried to force the memories back into fruition. 

But they were gone. Like they never existed in the first place. All I had was the vague idea of coffee and rain. 

There was something stuck into my arm- and it stung. 

An IV drip. 

Whatever they put inside it was doing a good job of keeping me foggy minded. 

A voice pierced the silence after a while.

I knew who it was. Through feathered vision, I could see her tangled golden hair tied into pigtails. 

No longer wearing the wedding dress, Annalise‚Äôs odd choice of clothing had been replaced by a pale-blue gown which hung off of her. The girl was bent over me, her hair tickling my face. 

I could feel her warm breath, but I couldn‚Äôt respond. 

‚ÄúElle?‚Äù Her voice was like waves crashing onto the shore, drifting in and out. 

At some points, I was sure she was there, but others she was fading away. 

In my drug-drunk brain, I wondered if she was a ghost. 

Maybe whoever controlled Brightwood had killed her. 

I could see she was struggling with my restraints, her fingernails slicing into my skin. Okay, maybe *not* a ghost.

Annalise‚Äôs trembling hands combed through my matted hair, and I had a sudden, painful flash of a hand stroking my face, sending electric shocks through me. 

My body jerked involuntarily, and the sensation returned, an overwhelming fear twisting me into knots. I could feel a stranger's hand brushing my cheek, rough fingers grazing my lips before delving into the back of my mouth.

I blinked, and the flash was gone. 

But I could still feel phantom fingers forcing their way into my mouth until I was choking on the stink of bleach, and like I was reliving it, a strangled cry clawed from my throat. 

Annalise‚Äôs breaths tickled my cheeks. ‚ÄúPlease, Elle.‚Äù She whispered. ‚ÄúI don't want to be alone.‚Äù

Sniffling, the girl leaned over my face, and something wet hit my forehead.

Rain?

‚ÄúElle. I don‚Äôt want you to be turned into a Peeker. That‚Äôs what they do here,‚Äù she whimpered. ‚ÄúThey turn us into Peekers.‚Äù

I only had to squint to see the band-aid over the girl‚Äôs nose seeping red. Looking closer at her, Annalise was bleeding too. 

I‚Äôm not sure how long she stayed. It could have been seconds or hours. 

Her cry sliced through me like a banshee‚Äôs wail. ‚ÄúThis is where they turned me‚Ä¶ crazy.‚Äù Annalise paced my bed, scratching at her own face.

‚ÄúKaz Isaacs, *crazy*,‚Äù she whispered, breaking down. I felt her weight on my bed. ‚ÄúI didn't *want* to be Kaz Isaacs crazy, so they made my thoughts go away!‚Äù

Her voice swam in and out of my brain at the mercy of the IV. 

When three orderlies came running in to grab and drag the girl away, I could do nothing but move my finger slightly. 

Then my toe. 

I don‚Äôt know if it was the drugs, or maybe I was dreaming‚Äîbut when I was conscious enough to sit up and prop myself up on my pillows, still blinking through mind fog, Annalise came back.

This time, she didn‚Äôt scream or cry out, only standing in front of me with the sanest expression I had ever seen on her face. I noticed there was no blood, and her hair looked neater, pulled into a strict ponytail. 

This time Annalise wore a coral colored dress. 

She was smiling, before lifting a finger and pressing it to her lips in a shushing motion. 

There was something in her hand, a rectangular device which perfectly melded into her palm.

She pointed it directly at me. 

‚ÄúSmile.‚Äù

.

*‚ÄúAnnalise?‚Äù*

My voice sounded strange, like it was more memory than real. It could have been hours after I saw her, or I saw a drug-induced hallucination. 

But when I was finally sitting up with enough energy to shimmy out of my restraints and tug out my IV, I knew I had to find her. 

I could feel her blood still staining my forehead and cheek, dry and flaky when I swiped at it. 

Before I could think about the repercussions of diving out of bed after significant dental surgery, I threw my legs over the side and jumped up, which immediately sent me off balance.

The room I was in smelled of lavender and  bleach, which twisted my gut. 

I knew the smell, but it was much stronger in my memory‚Äîmore like a suffocating, intoxicating poison filling my mouth. There was one door and no windows. The door was unlocked. 

I found myself torn between going on the hunt for Annalise or answering the gut-wrenching shriek echoing down the hallway, which was definitely Kaz Isaacs.

Part of me knew the boy was not to be trusted, considering what was on the monitor's in the room with the wall-people. 

However, my legs kept moving, my body forcing me into a stumbling run.

Kaz was right at the end of the hall, his screams getting progressively more hysterical the closer I got to the door. 

It was open, with enough room to stick my head through the gap.

Kaz was in a similar situation to me, strapped down to a hospital bed reclined under a bright light shining in his face. 

His eyes were wide with fright, bloody gauze sticking out of his mouth. Wriggling against the restraints, the boy was crying. 

I had never seen him cry before. 

Kaz always had this permanent look of amusement on his face in class, so seeing him crying, fighting against the orderlies trying to hold him down, was jarring. 

It had taken strapping his arms, torso, and head to the bed to keep him down and somehow, Kaz was still managing to get the upper hand, straining against gloved hands pushing him down. 

I expected the masked people standing over him to look pissed, but to my surprise, they looked... worried.

I caught looks exchanged between them, with one of them holding the same device used to drill into my mouth. 

I could see why they were worried. 

Kaz was sweating. 

Bad. 

The blue gown replacing his clothes was practically glued to him, his skin glistening under fluorescent light. 

He looked younger, more vulnerable, dark brown curls hanging in wet clumps against his forehead, half-lidded eyes clouded, like something had been injected into his pupils. Kaz himself didn't seem to notice his state. 

When one of them dared edge towards him, a shot in their hands, the boy sprang back against the pillows, lips curling into a snarl.

‚ÄúIf you *touch* me with that thing, I swear to fucking god, you‚Äôre dead. I will fucking kill you. Do you hear me?‚Äù

He must have had gusto in his tone because the figure backed away, nodding feebly. Kaz‚Äôs capture was different to mine. While I was treated like a prisoner, the orderlies around him seemed to be working under *his* command. The man cleared his throat. 

‚ÄúSir, to complete the procedure we must put you under anesthesia. It is a very painful process.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Kaz blinked rapidly, and when he was caught off guard, a needle was stuck inside his arm and quickly attached to an IV.

His eyes widened when he realized, and he tugged it like a child, his mouth opening and closing. ‚ÄúGet it out,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù Kaz‚Äôs cry went from an animalistic growl to a feeble whimper. 

Another figure appeared. ‚ÄúYour tooth has been destroyed, young man. It can see pieces of it in your saliva. There is no need to put on an act.""

He leaned over Kaz, prodding the boy in the forehead. ‚ÄúUnless you are being serious. I know you are prone to playing pranks on townspeople, which your subscribers enjoy.‚Äù The man's eyebrows twitched. He inspected the boy‚Äôs face.

‚ÄúHowever, I think you are being sincere. Which means you have been poisoned by your own faulty tooth.‚Äù

Kaz‚Äôs eyes widened. ‚ÄúElle was right?‚Äù

‚ÄúCorrect.‚Äù The man leaned back, displeasure creasing his voice. 

‚ÄúWe briefed you on it multiple times. You legally consented to its use, even showed enthusiasm. We‚Äôre worried about you, sir. Your personality has shifted.‚Äù

He studied Kaz as if he were a specimen, stroking a scalpel between long fingers. Kaz followed the motion with feverish eyes.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no secret you‚Äôve been different. You haven‚Äôt produced the kills outlined in your agreement. In fact, you haven‚Äôt killed anyone since you were fifteen.‚Äù He clucked his tongue. ‚ÄúWe worry. Your fans worry. Sponsors are pulling out.‚Äù

He stepped closer. ‚ÄúDid you know Luke Thompson quietly retracted his donation? Even your best friend has abandoned you. Kaz Isaacs is topping the poll to be removed from Darkroom, and what does that do to your reputation?‚Äù

His voice dropped. ‚ÄúWhere is the spark you had when you murdered your family?‚Äù

Kaz spat. A single globule struck the man‚Äôs face.

‚ÄúI have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about! I didn‚Äôt kill my family! I killed Jessa Pollux in ninth grade!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ makes more sense.‚Äù The man sighed, as if relieved. ‚ÄúMr. Delacroix, it appears our theories are correct. You‚Äôve been poisoned. Your tooth is sending signals that have regressed you to your temporary self. That is a problem.‚Äù

He signaled for the bed to recline further. Kaz strained, lunging against the restraints.

‚ÄúTemporary self?‚Äù Kaz gasped.

‚ÄúYes. We liked him at first. You were a wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing, perfect for viewers. Darkroom builds a steady audience by letting them watch Brightwood unfold.""

""Your fans want to see you rip the town apart. Instead, what we‚Äôve been given is pathetic. You had the chance to slice Annalise Duval‚Äôs throat, and you failed spectacularly.‚Äù

A cold shiver crawled down my spine. My classmate‚Äôs expression mirrored mine.

Kaz let out a raw cry. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?!‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, to put it simply, Mr. Delacroix.‚Äù

He lunged, the restraints snapping him back.

‚ÄúStop calling me that!‚Äù he shouted, wrenching at the Velcro, trying to rip out the IV.

The masked figures ignored him. Like they had with me, they set out steel instruments as if preparing for surgery. When screaming did not work, he lashed out with his feet, and two pairs of hands pinned them down.

‚ÄúWhat you need to understand, sir,‚Äù the man said, wrapping a hand around Kaz‚Äôs arm and slipping a second needle into his vein, his voice low, ‚Äúis that you are dying. If that faulty molar continues to send those signals, it will kill you.‚Äù

Kaz‚Äôs shriek was muffled beneath the man‚Äôs palm.

""You did that to Annalise.‚Äù Kaz‚Äôs voice slurred slightly, blinking rapidly. ‚Äú*You* fucked with her head, you fucking..."" his expression twisted, searching for an insult. 

""Asshole.""

To my surprise, the man's eyes darkened. 

He really *was* worried. 

‚ÄúI think you are mistaken, young man,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe did not touch Annalise Duval.‚Äù 

He got close, so close, Kaz tried to twist his head around.

‚ÄúYou, however? Mr Delacroix, how could you forget your most popular stream? Surely, you remember cracking the girl‚Äôs skull open when she was still conscious.‚Äù

When Kaz spat in his face, he straightened up. 

‚ÄúPut the kid under,‚Äù he ordered. ‚ÄúNow. I'm not losing my top influencer because a fucking faulty tooth turns him into a decent human being.‚Äù

He softened his tone when Kaz stopped struggling, his body going limp, the drugs beginning to take hold. 

I watched a bluish fluid fill the plastic tube protruding into his wrist. 

The man picked up a drill and held it  in front of Kaz‚Äôs flickering eyes struggling to stay open. ‚ÄúYou told us you were okay, that it was not hurting you‚Äîand you lied.‚Äù His voice grew firm, like a father. 

‚ÄúYou lied to everyone who trusted you. Your followers. Your sponsors.‚Äù

Kaz‚Äôs eyes fluttered, the bluish fluid draining the fight out of him, his struggles reduced to weak, half-hearted tugs against the restraints. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking‚Ä¶about?‚Äù

The man leaned in close, his voice low and soothing. 

‚ÄúJust sleep. I will fix everything.‚Äù

When Kaz went under, the man turned to his colleagues. 

‚ÄúThese fucking influencers expect to be paid when they can‚Äôt even follow a simple instruction. Kaz Isaacs was one of our best. If this is sabotage, they‚Äôre doing a great job of screwing with one of our prized content creators. The kid can‚Äôt even remember his real name.‚Äù

When the procedure started, I couldn‚Äôt look away.

The drilling noise began, and I cringed at the sound, like teeth grinding against tiny blades.

‚ÄúAh,‚Äù the man said. ‚ÄúIn the process of removing the faulty tooth, it‚Äôs badly damaged. In fact, I‚Äôm surprised the boy hasn‚Äôt been experiencing serious side effects. I‚Äôm glad we caught it early.‚Äù

He straightened up. Something was pinched between his thumb and forefinger.

‚ÄúSee? It‚Äôs singed on three corners. My general observation, without a full examination, is that we were sending too many signals and overwhelming it, causing significant damage.‚Äù

Another figure nodded grimly. ‚ÄúThat would explain the behavioral differences. It must have been agony, and the poor kid wouldn‚Äôt have realized it once regression had taken hold.‚Äù

She let out a quiet hiss. ‚ÄúMr. Delacroix must have been so scared.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù The main surgeon, still holding the tooth, nodded. He turned back to Kaz.

‚ÄúI will interpolate a new molar. This one should not have problems, and the boy should revert to his original state. Kaz Isaacs is valuable to Brightwood.‚Äù

He tugged off blood-stained gloves and pulled on new ones, pinching Kaz‚Äôs chin and forcing the unconscious boy to face him. ‚ÄúThis is your fault for not reporting symptoms.‚Äù

He let the kid‚Äôs head drop.

‚ÄúIf the tooth malfunctions again, put him in the Red Room with the others. I‚Äôll release a statement claiming he‚Ä¶‚Äù

The man sighed. ‚ÄúFuck. Make it up! I don‚Äôt know, say he‚Äôs taking a break from Darkroom. I‚Äôm sure his fans will do some killing of their own and upload it in protest, which will bring us a spike in views. After months in the Red Room, the face of Darkroom will be good as new, and we can put this behind us.‚Äù

He continued speaking, more to himself than to his colleagues, poking around in Kaz‚Äôs mouth. One of them, a woman this time, turned to the door.

‚ÄúRight. And for now?‚Äù

I ducked out of view before risking another peek.

The man was drilling again, using a tube to suck up saliva and blood dribbling from the boy‚Äôs mouth.

‚ÄúFor now, after surgery, we send him downstairs to undergo some significant personality changes. Viewers want a bad boy to root for. Call Luke, too.‚Äù

He sighed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure a familiar face will help remind him what he is and what he does.""

""Viewers do not want to see what they saw today, a pathetic child with no backbone, following around the resident crazy girl like a sheep. Once he started screaming, our viewer count dropped to one million. That‚Äôs our lowest in three years.‚Äù

He started drilling again, and Kaz‚Äôs body shuddered, his fingers forming a fist before going limp.

‚ÄúPeople want monsters. They want severed body parts and brains leaking on the sidewalk. Kaz Isaacs is too soft. However, his infatuation with Elle is‚Ä¶ well, it‚Äôs intriguing.‚Äù

Something ice-cold slipped down my spine.

Kaz‚Äôs body jolted again, his eyes flickering.

‚ÄúWe could do classic enemies to lovers. That will bring in the viewers. Then, of course, he brutally kills her, reclaiming his Darkroom crown.‚Äù

The man emphasized his words by stabbing his scalpel into the kid‚Äôs mouth.

He lifted his head and removed his mask, flashing perfect, pearly whites.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve known this kid for years, Phoebe. I doubt he needs electroshock to rattle his brain and tell him to kill. It‚Äôs rooted inside of him. Just like all of our Darkroom originals.‚Äù

Before the woman could reply, I was already backing away and catapulting myself into a run. I had to get out.

No.

My thoughts were feverish.

I had to find Annalise.

I found her in a room full of townspeople.

Mrs. Jenson was among them, but she didn‚Äôt look like my neighbor anymore.

Her skin was almost completely gone, flesh peeling from a skeletal mouth stretched into a horrific laugh that rattled her frame.

Mrs. Jenson‚Äôs eyes were wide open, staring forward at an oblivion only she could see. 

The townspeople around her were in various states of decay, and yet they kept laughing and laughing until I had to press my hands over my ears to block them out. Their newest addition was at the very back, and when I saw her, my stomach dropped.

The girl was giggling at the screen, her eyes empty, emptier than they had ever been.

Annalise‚Äôs lips were stretched into a cartoonish smile, and when I slapped her across the face, when I shook her, screaming at her to wake up, she didn‚Äôt move. Her body was like a mannequin.

When I grasped her hand, her skin was wet. Slimy. With every laugh, I noticed beads of sharp red slipping from her nose and mouth.

This was what I had heard in my bedroom when my reality had faltered.

It was the noise that had attracted me to the forest. 

I was hearing the sounds of the townspeople laughing themselves to death. And when death came, somehow, they didn‚Äôt stop. 

They kept going until their skin was rotting away, a laugh trapped inside a corpse. 

I tripped over three separate bodies trying to get to Annalise, and they were nothing but shredded flesh. 

With Annalise, she was only giggling, occasionally sputtering out hysterics, spewing bloody saliva. 

But soon it would be wracking her body. 

Grasping onto the girl's shoulders, like clinging onto her would snap her out of it, I knelt in front of Annalise Duval and promised I would be back. Then I left her.

The last door on the long winding hallway was surely the way out.

But when I was pulling it open, a hand was on my shoulder, yanking me back.

It was Kaz.

Well, it was mostly Kaz.

""Hey, sup, Elle!""

The first thing I noticed was his inability to stand up straight, and the gaping wound in his arm where he too had torn out his IV.

Kaz‚Äôs voice sounded off-kilter, and he was swaying from side to side, struggling to get a proper grasp of my shoulders. He was out of breath, one finger pressed into a piece of gauze hanging out of his mouth.

Still startlingly pale and just out of surgery, Kaz was somehow holding his old tooth down.

His lips were split into a bloody grin, rivulets of red beading down his chin.

I had no idea how he was standing, or coherently talking, because the last I had seen him the boy was practically brain-dead.

I found my voice, my gaze flicking to his blood-drenched hospital gown.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my blood,‚Äù he slurred. ‚ÄúI don't know whose blood it is! I just woke up, and I'm covered in blood! Whose blood? Who knows!‚Äù He idly licked his finger, immediately pulling a face. ‚ÄúOkay, that's mine. That is definitely my blood.‚Äù

I slapped him, snapping him out of it.

‚ÄúKaz. Focus.‚Äù

Kaz shook his head, his flickering eyes struggling to meet mine. Whatever was in his system, he was fighting it.

""Also, no time. No time‚Ä¶ nooo time‚Ä¶""

He kept repeating himself, reminding me of Annalise in the earlier days.

""If we‚Äôre‚Ä¶ if we‚Äôre going to knock your tooth out, we‚Äôre doing it now. Like, right now. Before I bleed out. But you need to promise me.""

Kaz grabbed me, pulling me toward him.

‚ÄúProhhhmiiseee meeeeeee.‚Äù

His fingernails dug into my flesh. ""You can‚Äôt let them take my tooth out, Elle.""

His expression darkened, and I glimpsed a glimmer of coherence before he snickered. ""Also, I‚Äôm, like, really high on anesthesia right now, so we gotta do this like now. I just gotta aim for, uhh, your mouth, right?""

Whatever was in his tooth was killing him.

I had to get it out at some point.

‚ÄúI promise.‚Äù I lied. ‚ÄúKnock it out.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood!‚Äù His mental state must have masked my real expression.

He was hopped up on wacky drugs, but somehow his hit sent me crumpling to the floor. This time I felt it dislodging, a writhing thing twitching in my mouth.

Kaz realized his mistake, dropping to his knees when my vision blurred. ""Elle, the walls are moving, and I can't carry you. Hey, now's not the time for sleep! Stay with me. Shit!""

A voice boomed, crackling through a speaker.

‚ÄúMr Delacroix, please stay where you are. This is for the good of your health.‚Äù

I was aware of Kaz dragging me, Brightwood mixing with another world slipping back into my mind. 

But once again I was caught inside an explosion of agony that contorted my thoughts into a nonsensical blur. 

Memories came over me, but this time they were pure clarity.

I was inside a coffee shop on a bustling street in the late evening.

The feathered reality of Brightwood had split apart, catapulting me back into the real world.

With no confusing filter over the memory, I could see groups of people: college kids and teenage girls gulping down coffee and typing on laptops.

The sight of it was overwhelming, my old life slamming into me. I had a brother: Nick.

I had a mother, and a father.

My own whisper echoed, and this time I could hear myself perfectly, my voice trembling.

""What do you want?""

I was still nameless, but a whole other life was unraveling before my eyes.

A life I had left behind for a town in the middle of nowhere, cut off from the outside world, with its macabre rules.

The foggy blur over the memory was gone, revealing two years ago, my younger self, and the identity of the blurry face sitting in front of me: a smirking sixteen-year-old kid, leaning on his fist, dark eyes completely hollowed out.

He held that same rectangular device, a cellphone, pointing the camera at me.

Placing the phone in front of him, he covered his eyes before revealing them.

""Peek-a-boo!""

1nlzxf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1nlzxf9/detailed_trip_report_chiang_mai_thailand_july_17/,"Detailed Trip Report - Chiang Mai, Thailand July 17 to Aug 15 , 2025","I was there for as a nomad for a month Nimman neighborhood and thought this may be useful for both nomads and tourist travellers.

# The Atmosphere

It is Thailand's 2nd largest city but it is far less hectic than Bangkok. To the west it‚Äôs rainforest as far as the Burmese border. Nimman, where I was, is trendy, wealthier, but not hectic or dead.

There are cafes, boutiques, coworking spaces, and night markets all clustered in one small neighbourhood.

It is even possible to not use any transport rent a scooter if you stick to Nimman like I did but that is something more for a nomad worker as opposed to a tourist.

Planes do actually fly very low over the city as the airport is very close to Nimman, so there is noise from that frequently. It is noticeable and something to bear in mind but not a massive deal breaker unless you have health or mental conditions affected by this.

# Food & Drink

* Regional specialties: Regional specialty is Khao Soi noodle soup that‚Äôs what you‚Äôll find all over. Personal favourites for it Kao Soy Nimman (Michelin-starred) and Pa Kiang Noodles Shop.
* One nimman One market street food: There is a food court inside One Nimman Plaza on the ground floor with ramen, Japanese curry, Hainanese chicken rice (Michelin-starred stall), pad thai, Peking duck rice, sweets like kanom krok, coconut ice cream, and longan juice all below ¬£3.
* Cafes and coworking: Yellow Coworking, Pai Yan Coffee, FOHHIDE, and Charlie Thai Tea (best Thai tea I‚Äôve ever had it‚Äôs ¬£2 a drink and it is something straight out of a high end cocktail bar). Craft coffee in Thailand is excellent and there is a growing culture of locally sources coffee, chocolate tea etc.
* Maya Mall: Has restaurants in the price range of ¬£5-10 per meal, although there is a more affordable street food style hall down below with numerous dessert stalls (bubble tea, Thai coconut sweets).
* Overall Variety: Thai focused on Northenr Thai > Japanese >Chinese hotpot > Vietnamese > Korean (BBQ included) > Western (pizzas, burgers, Italian) > Burmese> South Indian (including veg) > Other (Middle Eastern etc)

Both the quantity and quality of Japanese food in Chiang Mai especially curry rice, ramen, yakitori bars, Takoyaki, okonomiyaki, izayaka and sweets with matcha is phenomenal.

* Nightlife & drinking: There are crowded bars with students and locals, mainly weekends. As a nomad though I didn‚Äôt go.

# Gyms & Fitness

Besides Muay Thai weight lifting and cardio style gyms are more expensive in SE Asia with few costing less than ¬£50 and commonly up to ¬£100.

* Golden Hillside Gym: The exception at ¬£25/month. It has retro Nautilus machines (90s feeling) they are worn but all work. It gives a cool 'Arnold Golds gym' vibe but it was perfect value for money if you are more of a lifting person. It has 5 or so treadmills 4 or so bikes and does offer classes with a wood floor mirror studio and small kettle bell fake grass area
* Very difficult to find protein powder outside of gyms. Ordering online will cost you ¬£40 to ¬£50 slightly cheaper inside gyms but not by much. Even in Maya mall which is upsacle I struggled to find it.
* There are only a couple of ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô marketed low cal or high protein or vegan restaurants in Nimman but a lot of Thai food especially noodle soup dishes are already relatively healthy.
* Maya Mall Gym: Didn‚Äôt go but is around ¬£100 per month.

# Accommodation

* Golden Hillside Condo: Low cost, with the gym and pool (pool cannot be used without monthly occupancy). Noisy during day while refurbishment is in progress from 11 am to 4pm when I was there. Rooms are ok not super nice.
* Vienping Condo: Near Maya Mall. My room was renovated room so it was nicer but it is hard for me to tell what other airbnb in there would be like.

Laundry is convenient and affordable I got 7kg washed, ironed, picked up and delivered for ¬£12 at Foo Foo Laundry.

# Getting Around

* Your go-to taxi and bike taxi is Grab app. The ride fee is typically ¬£2-3 from Nimman to the old city city centre in a decent air conditioned aar. Food delivery charges are ¬£2 or under if you select the longer wait time option. Giving you room to tip.
* The area around yellow coworking space is a grid it is walkable but you need to pay attention since it is a 2 way road with thin to no pavements. The main rods almost always have pavements further away from the traffic. Working and eating there as a Nomad with my accommodation under 10 mins walk away was the main reason I never needed transport for a whole month. Other than to the airport or my day out at the Buhddist temple.

# Weather & Cleanliness

Weather is in 3-5 day cycles: Clear Pixar movie sunshine/blue skies at 30¬∞C, cloudy with light rain, and storms. Even with storms, Nimman is pretty clean (just modest dirt and vegetation on the road next to the kerb and drains. In terms of man made rubbish it is very clean.

On the clear sunny days if you have a balcony view towards the mountain behind Maya mall it look stunning. The contrast between the green forrest covered mountain and blue sky. 

# Culture & Sightseeing

I went to Wat Chediluang Varaviharn: Temple of over 600 years old.

Note: females are not allowed inside the city pillar shrine as one of the Buddhist traditions.

It has a 600 year old original temple then a newer payer hall with a huge golden Buddha. it gives you access to the manuscript and Buddhist museum which is a small building inside the compound.

Unfortunately though the manuscripts were kept upstairs and that area was closed off and it looks like it was permanent.

National Museum, Chiang Mai: Mostly Buddhist relics and some neolithic ones but the English translations are poor.

I didn‚Äôt go but there is Doi Pui Mountain: Trekking, shrines, and cable car in the vicinity.

Seen lots of adverts for the Safari and zoo but didn‚Äôt go.

Nimman one nimman night market has live music and craft and fashion stalls and delicious BBQ skewers.

# Safety

* Nimman and Chiang Mai were very safe. There even is an English-language tourist police hotline.
* City roads are sufficiently illuminated, but there are some residential areas that are not.
* Roughly 80% of restaurants are cash only even in Nimman. ATMs are \~¬£5 each withdrawal on Mastercard.

# Budget Snapshot (monthly)

* Airbnb: ¬£300-350
* Food & groceries: ¬£300 if you make breakfast at home but ¬£400+ if eating out 3 meals per day every day plus drinks/desserts
* eSIM: ¬£15-20
* Activities: ¬£150
* Coworking space: ¬£40 at yellow but can vary a bit
* Lifts: ¬£2-3 each ride

# Practical Bits

* Arrival: You need to transfer airports in Bangkok (Suvarnabhumi to Don Mueang) then Don Mueang to Chiang Mai. You get a complimentary 40 min transfer by shuttle bus for Suvarnabhumi to Don Mueang if you present your flight ticket.
* Internet: Both 5G and WiFi are excellent throughout from Airbnb, coworking and the esmi
* Grocery shopping: Maya Mall is no cheaper than home (Europe) in price - Crocs are ¬£75 Rimping Supermarket mall is reasonable for Western food.
* When you land you MUST buy thai green balm and mosquito repellent spray it on all of your exposed limbs. I learned the hard way.
* The locals have limited English. With the best Engilsh being in the 18-25 age group so it is ideal to learn a few Thai phrases for thank you, hello/goodbye etc.

# Community & Crowd

* Lots of Korean and Chinese tourists and some locals. But not crowded and over touristified and not dead. Everyone seemed well behaved though.
* CAMP coworking library (Maya Mall) was mostly locals. There was more expats at Yellow Coworking if you are into networking as a English speaker.

# Regrets & Lessons

* It wasn't worth daily excursions for Western breakfasts. Could have made eggs, bacon, and toast at home for so much less.
* Length of stay: 5-7 days is enough time for an overview for the average tourist. One month is ideal if you work remotely.

# TL;DR

It is relaxed, affordable, safe, and a foodie heaven , if you are in Nimman. Perfect for slow travelers and remote nomads, but if you are just a tourist traveler, 5-7 days will suffice due to lack of activities which are mainly Buddhist temples, the nearby nature and hikes and zoo/safari.",2,1758379214.0,solotravel,0,0.75,False
1nlzwz2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nlzwz2,"Mae Sariang, Thailand update - 4 pictures with captions","The town of Mai Sariang in Mae Hong Son province no longer has any budget, simple style guesthouses. Riverside Guesthouse closed years ago but the building is still there as seen in the first picture. North West Guesthouse is also long gone with nothing to replace it. Cheapest price accommodation seems to be about 500 baht although you get air con and bathroom. PS Riverview Guesthouse also has fridge in the room and free coffee for that price. Was told there was a hostel but couldn't find it. There doesn't seem any places with simple wooden fan rooms. 

There are hardly any tourists or travellers here now just some expats. Was told this was because the Mae Hong Son loop route had changed and many riders have stopped coming here. However a guesthouse owner said after the wet season ends there are still riders coming thru. Other reasons may be so many are obsessed with Pai, the view of the river in Mai Sariang has been obscured by a wall like maze of resorts, restaurants, hotels so you can't see the river from the street and the town has become unrecognizable from the sleepy village it used to be in earlier times.

Good news is around the corner from PS Riverview guesthouse a scooter rental place also rents good bicycles with gears for reasonable price and you don't have to leave any security. Nice ride to Salaween National park. For those on motorbike the Burma border is 50kms away and there is nice scenery along the way and around the border area.

1nlzw6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nlzw6x/does_aqua_tru_aqt_filters_replacement_water/,Does Aqua Tru AQT Filters Replacement Water Filter Live Up to the Hype? Review,"Testing out the AquaTru AQT Filters Replacement Reverse Osmosis Filter has been an intriguing journey. This specific model is crafted for AquaTru Countertop and Under-Sink Purification Systems, designed to deliver purified water that tastes impeccable and feels just right. Over the past couple of weeks, I‚Äôve integrated this filter into my daily routine‚Äîeverything from filling up my morning coffee brewer to topping off a water bottle for a midday run. Its performance has not gone unnoticed, but there‚Äôs plenty to break down when considering this product.

**Design and Build Quality**

The AquaTru AQT Filters Replacement impressed me with its straightforward design and compact build. Measuring approximately 10""D x 3""W x 3""H, it fits seamlessly into the AquaTru purification systems without requiring additional setup headaches. Despite its being lightweight‚Äîjust 13.8 ounces‚Äîits metal material construction feels sturdy and gives off confidence in its durability. One standout feature is its IAPMO certification, which adds an extra layer of trust and reassurance about its safety and efficiency. My favorite part? It promised to last either two years or filter 1,200 gallons, whichever came first, which is a serious perk for someone like me who hates frequent replacements.

**Ease of Installation and Usability**

Right from the unboxing to getting it installed, the process felt almost too simple. The filter snapped right into its place within seconds‚Äîno fumbling, no tools, just click, secure, and done. It‚Äôs optimized for AquaTru Classic and Connect systems, and since I‚Äôve been using the Classic, it blended right in without any compatibility issues. AquaTru reminds users explicitly to stick with their branded replacement filters to maintain proper functionality, which sounds a bit restrictive but ensures reliable performance.

Check [AQUA TRU AQT Filters Replacement Reverse Osmosis Filter](https://aquagroove.com/p/b077j8hmwp/) deals on Amazon now.

**Advantages**

- Certified by NSF Standards, the filter reduces harmful toxins like arsenic, lead, and Chromium 6 to incredibly fine levels, down to 1/10000 of a micron.  
- Durable lifespan, lasting up to two years or 1,200 gallons before requiring a replacement.  
- Compact size and lightweight construction fit nicely into the AquaTru systems without hassle.  
- Straightforward installation process makes it accessible even for beginners.  

**Areas for Improvement**

- The exclusive requirement to use AquaTru-branded filters might limit flexibility for users looking for budget alternatives.  
- Although sturdy, the lightweight build might feel less premium compared to some other filter materials.  

**Performance and Filtration Capability**

There‚Äôs no denying that this replacement filter packs a punch when it comes to water purification. After installing it, I immediately noticed a significant improvement in the water‚Äôs clarity and taste. Even my highly critical coworker (major water snob) gave it the nod of approval after trying a glass straight from my filter. It excels at eliminating PFAS alongside other toxic contaminants like nitrates, further extending its appeal to those focused on health-conscious choices. Plus, knowing it‚Äôs efficient enough to remove particles as tiny as 1/10000 of a micron is remarkable‚Äîand honestly a little mind-blowing.

**Filter Longevity and Maintenance**

While testing many home products often comes with constant upkeep, this filter‚Äôs longevity is a refreshing change. As highlighted earlier, it can function seamlessly for two years under normal usage. Over two weeks of regular use, it hasn‚Äôt clogged, leaked, or shown any hiccups, which is critical for people like me who forget about maintenance tasks until it‚Äôs too late. The provided user manual was quite helpful in explaining how to track the gallons filtered via AquaTru‚Äôs systems. 

**Competing Products**

In comparison to other reverse osmosis filters, like those by brands such as APEC and iSpring, the AquaTru model focuses heavily on user simplicity and system compatibility. Both APEC and iSpring offer broader range filtration solutions, which might work great for entire households rather than countertop machines. However, they often lean bulkier and costlier to maintain over the long haul. The AquaTru stands stronger when used in smaller living spaces or when portability is a preference.

**Affordable Quality**

Although pricing always plays a massive role in decision-making, I‚Äôve found the value to be justifiable here, considering the advanced filtration and extended lifespan. Some competitive options on the market might be marginally cheaper up front, but they need replacement or maintenance more frequently. To me, this filter represents smart spending with no sacrificing performance goals.

I've currently gotten back into the high life that is full time employment (sarcasm) and due to the nature of my job, it involves a lot of travelling, time away from family and also a constant pace that requires many hours working and less for my free time. 

However, in the free time I do have, I love to read. Its one of the few rare escapes I find in my life and the pleasure of engrossing myself in a world or character that captivates me is unlike any feeling I've felt. 

Anyways, hello. 

I'm looking for someone to generally chat about literature with. Someone who is enthusiastic and talktive. I find that talking about the books we read and gushing about characters and story archs helps cement our own enjoyment.

The genres I've been reading lately are definitely Sci Fi, Fantasy and Romance (I know, guilty pleasure as a guy) along with some horror on the side.

I'm open to book recommendations too as well as perhaps picking a book to read and reading it together in our own time then discussing a chapter we've read or something along those lines. In any case, a reading buddy would be greatly appreciated to help me focus, prevent a slump and captivate my passion for literature. 

I've also been interested in exploring some romantasy which is a usual change of pace from my usual liking towards more epic fantasy tales. Also, anything with dark romance related undertones with gritty character arcs and vivid storytelling.


A little about me, aside from reading I'm an avid fitness enthusiast and I keep fit and excercise pretty regularly. A healthy body makes a healthy mind, as they say. I don't typically read in public, however I'm probably not someone you'd expect to be reading on a busy train or in a tucked away coffee shop (maybe you can change that). I'm keen to talk, though I am much better at listening and offering my own thoughts instead of yapping endlessly (though if you yap, that's more than fine by me)

Hikes on tall peaks, vast hills and epic views are where you'll likely find me. Along with running along nature trails and trying aimlessly to beat my 5km run time. I like to travel too, whether it be exploring new cities, visiting museums and art galleries or simply just taking in the sights.

If you're interested in chatting, feel free to reach out and I'd be more than happy to talk.

I do have discord if you'd prefer to chat there too.",1,1758379054.0,Book_Buddies,0,1.0,False
1nlzuj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Accomplished_Fee8879/comments/1nlzuj4/trimtone_fat_burner_a_complete_guide_for_beginners/,Trimtone Fat Burner: A Complete Guide for Beginners,"If you‚Äôve been exploring fat burners, you‚Äôve probably come across [Trimtone](http://yourfitnessapp.com/trimtone-review/), a supplement designed specifically for women. It‚Äôs often marketed as a simple, once-a-day solution to boost metabolism, control cravings, and speed up fat loss. But if you‚Äôre new to fat burners, you may be wondering: *what exactly is Trimtone, how does it work, and is it safe for beginners?* This guide breaks it all down in plain language.

# What Is Trimtone?

Trimtone is a **natural fat burner** made with plant extracts, caffeine, and fiber. Unlike some supplements that require multiple doses throughout the day, Trimtone is designed for simplicity‚Äîjust one capsule in the morning with water. Its main selling point is that it helps women who struggle with appetite control and sluggish metabolism, offering an extra push to support diet and exercise goals.

# How Does Trimtone Work?

Trimtone‚Äôs formula focuses on three main approaches:

1. **Boosting Metabolism** ‚Äì Ingredients like caffeine, green tea extract, and grains of paradise stimulate thermogenesis, which means your body burns more calories even at rest.
2. **Suppressing Appetite** ‚Äì The fiber glucomannan expands in your stomach, helping you feel fuller for longer and reducing cravings between meals.
3. **Increasing Energy** ‚Äì With added caffeine, Trimtone provides a clean energy lift, which may improve focus and workout performance.

For beginners, this means Trimtone doesn‚Äôt replace a healthy lifestyle, but it can help make sticking to calorie goals a bit easier.

# Key Ingredients

* **Caffeine Anhydrous (120 mg)** ‚Äì A natural stimulant that increases energy, focus, and calorie burning.
* **Green Tea Extract** ‚Äì Rich in antioxidants (EGCG), it supports fat oxidation and overall health.
* **Green Coffee Bean Extract** ‚Äì Contains chlorogenic acids that may influence how the body processes carbs and fats.
* **Grains of Paradise** ‚Äì A spice from the ginger family that may activate brown fat, encouraging calorie burn.
* **Glucomannan** ‚Äì A dietary fiber that expands in your stomach to help control appetite.

# Benefits of Trimtone

* Easy to use: one capsule daily
* May increase calorie burning
* Helps reduce cravings
* Provides a natural energy boost
* Contains no unnecessary fillers

# Possible Side Effects

Because Trimtone contains caffeine, some beginners may experience:

* Jitters or nervousness
* Restlessness or difficulty sleeping (if taken late in the day)
* Mild digestive issues from glucomannan

These effects are usually mild and can be minimized by sticking to the recommended dosage and avoiding excess coffee or energy drinks while using Trimtone.

# Who Should and Shouldn‚Äôt Use Trimtone?

**Best suited for:**

* Women who want extra support alongside diet and exercise
* Those who struggle with cravings or low energy
* Beginners looking for a straightforward, once-a-day supplement

**Not recommended for:**

* People sensitive to caffeine
* Pregnant or breastfeeding women
* Anyone with heart problems, high blood pressure, or medical conditions without consulting a doctor

# Final Thoughts

Trimtone isn‚Äôt a magic pill, but for beginners, it‚Äôs one of the simpler fat burners to try. With its one-capsule formula, natural ingredients, and focus on metabolism and appetite control, it can provide a gentle boost in your weight-loss journey. Pair it with a balanced diet, regular exercise, and good sleep, and Trimtone may help you see faster, more sustainable results.",1,1758379022.0,u_Accomplished_Fee8879,0,1.0,False
1nlzue0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nlzue0,Bimster‚Äôs Gnome Book Royalties (estimated percentages),"Alright, here‚Äôs a breakdown of how this works with Amazon self publishing (it‚Äôs called Kindle Direct Publishing, even if it‚Äôs a paperback or a hardcover). I‚Äôll admit to buying Bimmie‚Äôs book on Kindle mostly for convenience and so I wouldn‚Äôt have a cursed artifact sitting on my bookshelf next to all my Gene Wolfe books.

As a writer, I‚Äôve looked into KDP for myself (every other person I know has suggested it to me), so I figured Screenwave was making about 60%. Here‚Äôs the proof for that.

Amazon lets you put an estimate of your page count and dimensions into the KDP price tool and see your potential royalties. Now, I put first the hardcover, at $19.99, into the tool and got an estimate of $5.19. However, if you take the cost per unit $6.80, subtract that from the price per unit $19.99, you get the profit for Amazon before royalties $13.19. Then calculate royalties and you get $7.91. So the $5.19 could be based on sales prices? Unsure. Either way, he/Screenwave make more per unit on a hardcover than a ebook costs.

For paperback, which is $11.99, the estimated profit works out to $4.89 with similar math (why? Lower cost per unit).

What‚Äôs the take away from all this? To quote AdmiralKird, that I‚Äôm a gigantic nerd. But also that James and company are making bank on the physical copies that they are selling presumably for him to get fans to own as part of their collection.

Because of the price and size of the book, I think he can get a 70% royalty on ebook sales. So about $2.79. So enjoy that Dunkin Donuts coffee I bought you, Bimmy.",4,1758379012.0,TheCinemassacreTruth,9,0.75,False

I'm driving up to attend a concert at the Madison Square Garden, planning to spend extra days in the city for... you've guessed it, food. 

5 breakfasts, 5 lunches, 5 dinners.

-------

1. Need a list of must-try places, concentrating on the following cuisines: Georgian, Lebanese, Uzbeki, Greek, Uygur, other variations of Mediterranean and Central/North Asian. Some Slavic, Hungarian, Latin American thrown in for a good measure. 

Looking specifically for legendary lamb, beef, duck based stuff. Also cheese pies, soups, hand pulled noodles, dumplings of all sorts. 

Dying to try the best birria in NYC. Dying for a good khachapuri. Big juicy dumplings. Hot meaty dolma. Mmm. Monumental roasted potatoes on the side that make you cry for your mama. Grab-and-go lobster or scallops for lunch. Any kind of curious fusion! Street food! Bakeries with savory delights and amazing coffee! Maybe something new and inventive, take a classic and put an irresistible twist on it kind of deal. Make it greasy! Make it flavorful! Make it full of soul!

I want to be blown away and get enough emotions to last me a year in the culinary desert that is NC.

Not really looking for: anything French, German, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, molecular, pretentious, sandwiches, burgers, pizza, vegan, too sweet, super crowded, touristy.

-------

2. Need to figure out where to stay, best area for a basecamp for 4 nights, considering the trip objectives. Preferably a safe-to-walk area, or just tell me to bring pepper spray and my best punches I guess.

-------

3. Bonus karma for a great suggestion where to leave my vechicle so I don't have to drag it into the city. Ubers and walking is how I plan to be getting around. Public transport is kind of confusing to me, and I'd rather not waste time trying to figure it out for such a short stay.

It was the first time I had ran Mothership and none of my players had played it. Here are the results. I am putting this in spoiler text just in case.

TL;DR: It was a thrilling adventure with an ending that allows each player to imagine their characters fate. I had an awesome time running it with little prep and the game ran fluidly.

I had three players. There was a marine, a scientist, and a teamster. I started the session with the team receiving a contract from the company to deliver some scientific supplies and maintenance equipment for the drilling machines. >!They met Sonya over the comms and she instructed them to dock. Once the got docked, she explained that there were a few issues. Only 75% of the ore they were to pick up was available. The other 25% was still down in the mine. They were not able to bring it up because the elevator had quick working last night. The other issue was that Mike who was head of the operation hadn't been seen since last night. !<He is the only one who can take stock of the delivery and sign off of the ore shipment going out. 

The teamster and the scientist agreed to go ahead and start unloading their cargo with the help of >!Morgan and Kantaro (who is smelling really ripe) !<while the marine decided he would see if he could help >!Ashraf with the elevator controls.!< >!The marine manages to get a success on the roll to fix the elevator and it begins to come back up.

So the marine enters the mess while the others are still going over paperwork and unloading the cargo. >!This is when he meets Dana and Prince. He chats with Dana a bit and then decides to pet Prince. Unfortunately Prince is not having any of this. He scratches and bites the marine for 1 damage. The table had a great laugh at this.!<

The party regroups in the workspace and this is when they meet >!Rosa and learn more about the events of the last month or so which includes the discovery of the goo, the arrival of Dr. Giovanni, and the strange actions of him and Mike yesterday. After some further questioning, they find out that Dr. Giovanni obtained a sample and has locked himself in docking bay 1. This is also when Sonya sends Morgan and Kantaro down the elevator to bring the rest of the ore up.!< The party decides to see if they can talk to >!Dr. Giovanni.!<

>!They try to reach him on the radio and intercom, but he doesn't respond. The marine decides to try and jury rig the airlock to gain access to the docking bay. They find that the doctor still isn't responding to them so the teamster climbs up on the ship and peers in through the cockpit. All he sees is the controls a small hallway with two doors, one of which is slightly ajar, and a ladder leading down presumably into the cargo area. The marine tries to jury rig the cargo ramp but is only able to get it to open about six inches.!< This is when things get really good.

>!They lift the scientist up so she can peer into the cargo area. She sees Dr. Giovanni as described except he gets down on all fours and starts running towards her. She asks the marine for his frag grenade and tosses it into the cargo hold and drops to the ground. The grenade goes off and smoke starts rolling out of the opening. Sonya gets on the radio asking what is going on. They tell her and she tells them that they need to get in there and put any fire out that they may have caused.!< If it reaches the fuel supply, the thing will blow and take out the station with it. 

>!They manage to find some fire extinguishers and a jack to open the cargo ramp about 3 feet.

The put out the fire in the cargo bay and check to see if there is any fire on the upper level. They find the washroom destroyed and the tape of the doctor's notes as outlined in the module. By this time the party has figured out the goo is adverse to water and find a half full jug of water (about 4 ""splashes worth"") that they take with them. They play the tape for Sonya. She agrees to!< open the airlock >!explaining that only Kantaro came back up the elevator without the ore. He had attacked Rosa but she was able to knock him out.!<

They enter the decompression chamber. They notice that they can hear the elevator running. >!It should be Morgan and Kantaro returning with the ore.

1nlzq9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActuallyReviewed/comments/1nlzq9h/why_is_arm_hammer_super_washing_soda_a_game/,Why Is ARM HAMMER Super Washing Soda a Game Changer in Cleaning,"There‚Äôs something oddly satisfying about finding a household product that truly pulls its weight across multiple chores. Testing out the ARM & HAMMER Super Washing Soda Household Cleaner has been quite an experience, especially considering its versatility. At first glance, you might think it‚Äôs just another laundry booster. But after weeks of integrating it into my cleaning routine, I have to say‚Äîit‚Äôs much more. And while there are certainly standout features, it‚Äôs not without a few quirks.

**Versatility for Every Task**  
What initially caught my attention with this product was its promise of versatility. From laundry care to general-purpose cleaning, this washing soda has been my go-to. On laundry day, I added a scoop alongside my usual detergent and noticed my whites looking noticeably brighter. Even stubborn coffee stains on some old towels seemed lighter. Beyond laundry, I tested it on multiple surfaces‚Äîkitchen sinks, stovetops, and even the slightly grimy bathtub. It handled them all. ARM & HAMMER Super Washing Soda also moonlights as a silver polish. An old silver bracelet that I hadn‚Äôt dared to wear because of tarnish now sparkles like new after a quick soak. If you‚Äôre someone who prioritizes a minimalistic cleaner cabinet, this product is worth considering.  

[Check ARM & HAMMER Super Washing Soda Household Cleaner price on Amazon.](https://info.senaar.com/p/b0029xnteu)

**Good Points**  
- Truly fragrance-free and phosphate-free, making it gentle for those sensitive to strong scents or unnecessary additives.  
- Enhances laundry detergent performance, saving the need for re-washing.  
- Excellent for various surfaces, from countertops to jewelry, making it multi-functional.  

**Effectiveness Meets Limitation**  
While it certainly excels in many areas, its highly alkaline nature has to be handled with care. This isn‚Äôt a grab-it-and-go product you toss anywhere without thought. For instance, I mistakenly tested it on a decorative tile surface in our guest bathroom. Who knew that wasn‚Äôt ideal? The high pH can damage sensitive materials like marble or aluminum, leaving behind dull spots. That being said, it‚Äôs easy to avoid such issues with a bit of research.  

**Caveats**  
- Not suitable for delicate or sensitive surfaces (e.g., aluminum, some natural stones).  
- Requires mixing or dissolving for many tasks, which might not suit everyone‚Äôs preference for ready-to-use products.  
- While odor-neutralizing, it leaves no added scent for those who enjoy fragrant cleaners.  

**Performance Compared to Alternatives**  
Comparing this washing soda to similar products, like baking soda and multi-purpose cleaners, some differences stand out. While both ARM & HAMMER Super Washing Soda and classic baking soda are natural and eco-friendly, this washing soda is significantly more powerful. It handles tougher stains and grime better. On the other hand, modern all-in-one cleaners often come pre-mixed and are quicker to apply, but they can‚Äôt match the raw effectiveness this product brings to tougher cleaning challenges.  

Another notable competitor in laundry performance is oxygen bleach. While this washing soda excels as a booster, oxygen bleach tends to be gentler on colors. However, washing soda wins in terms of cost-effectiveness, especially for large households.  

**Quality for Price**  
From a financial perspective, this product offers incredible value. Its versatility means fewer purchases for separate cleaning needs, which can add up over time. Instead of buying a separate laundry booster, jewelry polisher, and multi-purpose cleaner, this single box does it all. While some users might need to experiment to find the correct usage, once mastered, you can unlock its full potential. Given the results I‚Äôve seen in both laundry and household cleaning, this washing soda proves that high-quality products don‚Äôt have to come with an extravagant price tag.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

""Future Antony will handle it,"" I'd smugly declared, only for Future Antony (who, it turns out, was Present Antony, and quite annoyed) to discover that ""it"" was a particularly stubborn algorithm. Now, with the final lines of code shimmering on the screen, I leaned back, stretching a kink out of my neck, and glanced out the window.



The world outside felt incredibly, almost mockingly, alive. Below, the city sprawled, a tapestry of muted glow and vibrant streaks. Headlights and taillights painted fleeting crimson and amber lines on the wet asphalt, a silent, ceaseless ballet. The distant hum of the freeway, usually a dull drone, now seemed to throb with a low, rhythmic pulse, like the city's own nocturnal heartbeat. A faint, sweet scent of damp earth and something vaguely metallic‚Äîrain on concrete, perhaps‚Äîdrifted in through the barely ajar window, mingling with the stale air of my room. Even the moon, a sliver of silver hanging aloof in the inky sky, seemed to cast a knowing, almost mischievous, gaze upon the restless urban sprawl. It was a world that didn't care for sleep schedules, a world that thrived in the quiet hours, and for a moment, I envied its unburdened existence.



My gaze drifted back to my room, and the brief enchantment shattered. It was less a room and more an archaeological dig site. Empty coffee mugs formed precarious towers on my desk, surrounded by a scattering of crumpled energy bar wrappers, a forgotten textbook open to a page I'd long since abandoned, and a labyrinth of charging cables that seemed to have multiplied in the dark. Clothes, in various states of wear and disarray, formed soft, shapeless dunes on the floor, while a lone, forlorn sock lay stranded like a shipwreck survivor on the perilous sea of my carpet. The sheer monumental effort required to even begin cleaning it felt like a personal affront to my already exhausted brain. Why bother? The universe would just get messy again.



Closing the laptop with a definitive click, I decided to tackle a more pressing, and frankly, more human, duty: bathing. The bathroom, mercifully, was a sanctuary of relative order. Stepping under the shower, the warm water cascaded over me, a soothing balm against the mental static of brute-force coding. Each drop felt like it was washing away not just the grime, but the lingering stress, the self-imposed deadlines, and the ghost of that stubborn algorithm. My brain, usually a whirring engine of logic and problem-solving, finally found a moment of blissful, unthinking rest. I didn't want to leave. The warmth, the steam, the quiet hum of the water‚Äîit was a cocoon.



Then, the jarring intrusion. A shrill, insistent ring cut through the peaceful hiss of the shower. My phone. I froze, water still streaming down my face. Two in the morning. Who on earth? My mind immediately conjured a parade of well-meaning but utterly clueless colleagues, ready to pepper me with questions about the dry lab simulation, the presentation, the success (or lack thereof) of my algorithm. ""Was it a success?"" ""How did it go?"" ""Did you sleep?"" Their questions always felt so hollow, so utterly beside the point. I had no mood for it. The phone fell silent, and I let out a breath I hadn't realized I was holding.



Reluctantly, I stepped out, wrapped myself in a towel, and changed into the softest, most comfortable clothes I owned, already anticipating the sweet oblivion of sleep. I hadn't slept the night before, and the thought of a long, uninterrupted slumber was almost intoxicating. The moment I practically launched myself onto my bed, the phone shrieked again, making me question the very fabric of the universe. Before I could fully descend into a spiral of nihilistic despair, I glanced at the screen. ""Akira.""



The name hit me like a sudden, unexpected tidal wave of nostalgia. Images flashed through my mind: scraped knees and shared secrets, endless summer days, the taste of stolen mangoes, and the easy laughter that came with childhood friendship. A genuine, unbidden smile spread across my face, pulling at muscles I hadn't realized were stiff. I sat up, reaching for the thermos of coffee I'd brewed hours ago, pouring a lukewarm stream into a mug.



""Hello, is this Antony?"" Her voice, imbued with that familiar, almost melodic cadence, was a direct portal to a simpler time.



""Yeah, it is Antony,"" I said, my voice sounding far too energetic for my own ears, or the hour. ""How have you been?""



A soft, amused laugh drifted through the phone. ""Now you're asking me that?"" she feigned indignation, though the warmth in her tone betrayed her. ""When you never even thought about calling us? You never called after you left to study.""



""Sorry,"" I mumbled, taking a sip of the tepid coffee. ""I was kinda busy."" It wasn't a lie, not entirely. Life had become a blur of deadlines and data.



""Is that so?"" she said, a knowing quality in her voice that suggested she understood more than I'd let on. ""What were you doing before? Why didn't you pick up the call before?"" she pressed, her tone immediately shifting to playful interrogation.



""I was in my bath,"" I admitted, a small chuckle escaping me. ""Also, it's 2 AM here. I'm in America, remember?""



""It's 2 AM there?"" Her voice held a note of genuine surprise, and I wished I could see her face, imagine the slight widening of her eyes. ""You haven't adapted to sleep schedules yet, huh?"" she teased.



""Sleep schedule? What is that?"" I retorted, leaning into the joke. Her laughter, bright and clear, filled the silence on my end.



""Also,"" she added, after her laughter subsided, ""go check the light in your bathroom. You never close the lights off, do you?""



I paused, mug halfway to my lips. I looked towards the bathroom door, a quiet, almost overwhelming satisfaction blooming in my chest. There were still people who knew me. Not the algorithm-writing, dry-lab-simulating, presentation-giving Antony, but just‚Ä¶ me.



""Wait a second,"" I said, pushing off my desk and walking towards the bathroom. I heard a muffled male voice on her end, saying something I couldn't quite make out. Before I could ask, she spoke again, a sudden, bright ""Oh!"" in her voice, as if a thought had just clicked into place.



""I'm getting married next month,"" she announced, her voice brimming with uncontainable happiness.



My mind went utterly, completely blank. The world seemed to tilt on its axis for a few disorienting seconds. The distant hum of the city, the scent of damp earth, the lukewarm coffee ‚Äì everything faded into a dull, indistinct background.



""Hello?"" she said, her voice pulling me back from the precipice of my own stunned silence. ""Are you there?""



""Yeah,"" I managed, the word feeling thick and foreign on my tongue. ""I was just a little sleepy."" The lie tasted bitter, even to myself. Why had I said that?



""Sorry for calling you so late at night,"" she said, a hint of genuine apology in her tone. ""I forgot that time is different there.""



""It's alright,"" I said, sinking back into my chair, the coffee now forgotten.



""Anyway,"" she continued, her voice regaining its joyful lilt, ""Will you come?""



I looked at my calendar, a stark, empty grid on the wall. ""I probably won't be able to attend,"" I lied again, the words feeling heavy and hollow. ""I have some work to do.""



""Please,"" she pleaded, a soft urgency in her voice. ""You're one of my precious childhood friends.""



A laugh tried to escape me, a single, choked sound that died in my throat. No sound came out.



""I will try,"" I said instead, the words feeling like ash. ""Congrats on the good news, though. I wish you a happy, long life. If it becomes possible, I will surely come,"" I added, the promise feeling impossibly distant. ""It is very late right now here, I need to sleep.""



""Oh! Yeah,"" she said, her smile almost audible. ""Good night then‚Ä¶""



I looked at my coffee. It had grown completely cold.",1,1758378609.0,u_Logical_Jicama_8460,0,1.0,False

1nlzmng,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1nlzmng/detailed_trip_report_chiang_mai_thailand_july_17/,"Detailed Trip Report - Chiang Mai, Thailand July 17 to Aug 15 , 2025","I was there for as a nomad for a month Nimman neighborhood and thought this may be useful for both nomads and tourist travellers.

# The Atmosphere

It is Thailand's 2nd largest city but it is far less hectic than Bangkok. To the west it‚Äôs rainforest as far as the Burmese border. Nimman, where I was, is trendy, wealthier, but not hectic or dead.

There are cafes, boutiques, coworking spaces, and night markets all clustered in one small neighbourhood.

It is even possible to not use any transport rent a scooter if you stick to Nimman like I did but that is something more for a nomad worker as opposed to a tourist.

Planes do actually fly very low over the city as the airport is very close to Nimman, so there is noise from that frequently. It is noticeable and something to bear in mind but not a massive deal breaker unless you have health or mental conditions affected by this.

# Food & Drink

* Regional specialties: Regional specialty is Khao Soi noodle soup that‚Äôs what you‚Äôll find all over. Personal favourites for it Kao Soy Nimman (Michelin-starred) and Pa Kiang Noodles Shop.
* One nimman One market street food: There is a food court inside One Nimman Plaza on the ground floor with ramen, Japanese curry, Hainanese chicken rice (Michelin-starred stall), pad thai, Peking duck rice, sweets like kanom krok, coconut ice cream, and longan juice all below ¬£3.
* Cafes and coworking: Yellow Coworking, Pai Yan Coffee, FOHHIDE, and Charlie Thai Tea (best Thai tea I‚Äôve ever had it‚Äôs ¬£2 a drink and it is something straight out of a high end cocktail bar). Craft coffee in Thailand is excellent and there is a growing culture of locally sources coffee, chocolate tea etc.
* Maya Mall: Has restaurants in the price range of ¬£5-10 per meal, although there is a more affordable street food style hall down below with numerous dessert stalls (bubble tea, Thai coconut sweets).
* Overall Variety: Thai focused on Northenr Thai > Japanese >Chinese hotpot > Vietnamese > Korean (BBQ included) > Western (pizzas, burgers, Italian) > Burmese> South Indian (including veg) > Other (Middle Eastern etc)

Both the quantity and quality of Japanese food in Chiang Mai especially curry rice, ramen, yakitori bars, Takoyaki, okonomiyaki, izayaka and sweets with matcha is phenomenal.

* Nightlife & drinking: There are crowded bars with students and locals, mainly weekends. As a nomad though I didn‚Äôt go.

# Gyms & Fitness

Besides Muay Thai weight lifting and cardio style gyms are more expensive in SE Asia with few costing less than ¬£50 and commonly up to ¬£100.

* Golden Hillside Gym: The exception at ¬£25/month. It has retro Nautilus machines (90s feeling) they are worn but all work. It gives a cool 'Arnold Golds gym' vibe but it was perfect value for money if you are more of a lifting person. It has 5 or so treadmills 4 or so bikes and does offer classes with a wood floor mirror studio and small kettle bell fake grass area
* Very difficult to find protein powder outside of gyms. Ordering online will cost you ¬£40 to ¬£50 slightly cheaper inside gyms but not by much. Even in Maya mall which is upsacle I struggled to find it.
* There are only a couple of ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô marketed low cal or high protein or vegan restaurants in Nimman but a lot of Thai food especially noodle soup dishes are already relatively healthy.
* Maya Mall Gym: Didn‚Äôt go but is around ¬£100 per month.

# Accommodation

* Golden Hillside Condo: Low cost, with the gym and pool (pool cannot be used without monthly occupancy). Noisy during day while refurbishment is in progress from 11 am to 4pm when I was there. Rooms are ok not super nice.
* Vienping Condo: Near Maya Mall. My room was renovated room so it was nicer but it is hard for me to tell what other airbnb in there would be like.

Laundry is convenient and affordable I got 7kg washed, ironed, picked up and delivered for ¬£12 at Foo Foo Laundry.

# Getting Around

* Your go-to taxi and bike taxi is Grab app. The ride fee is typically ¬£2-3 from Nimman to the old city city centre in a decent air conditioned aar. Food delivery charges are ¬£2 or under if you select the longer wait time option. Giving you room to tip.
* The area around yellow coworking space is a grid it is walkable but you need to pay attention since it is a 2 way road with thin to no pavements. The main rods almost always have pavements further away from the traffic. Working and eating there as a Nomad with my accommodation under 10 mins walk away was the main reason I never needed transport for a whole month. Other than to the airport or my day out at the Buhddist temple.

# Weather & Cleanliness

Weather is in 3-5 day cycles: Clear Pixar movie sunshine/blue skies at 30¬∞C, cloudy with light rain, and storms. Even with storms, Nimman is pretty clean (just modest dirt and vegetation on the road next to the kerb and drains. In terms of man made rubbish it is very clean.

On the clear sunny days if you have a balcony view towards the mountain behind Maya mall it look stunning. The contrast between the green forrest covered mountain and blue sky. I took some video here

# Culture & Sightseeing

I went to Wat Chediluang Varaviharn: Temple of over 600 years old.

Note: females are not allowed inside the city pillar shrine as one of the Buddhist traditions.

It has a 600 year old original temple then a newer payer hall with a huge golden Buddha. it gives you access to the manuscript and Buddhist museum which is a small building inside the compound.

Unfortunately though the manuscripts were kept upstairs and that area was closed off and it looks like it was permanent.

National Museum, Chiang Mai: Mostly Buddhist relics and some neolithic ones but the English translations are poor.

I didn‚Äôt go but there is Doi Pui Mountain: Trekking, shrines, and cable car in the vicinity.

Seen lots of adverts for the Safari and zoo but didn‚Äôt go.

Nimman one nimman night market has live music and craft and fashion stalls and delicious BBQ skewers.

# Safety

* Nimman and Chiang Mai were very safe. There even is an English-language tourist police hotline.
* City roads are sufficiently illuminated, but there are some residential areas that are not.
* Roughly 80% of restaurants are cash only even in Nimman. ATMs are \~¬£5 each withdrawal on Mastercard.

# Budget Snapshot (monthly)

* Airbnb: ¬£300-350
* Food & groceries: ¬£300 if you make breakfast at home but ¬£400+ if eating out 3 meals per day every day plus drinks/desserts
* eSIM: ¬£15-20
* Activities: ¬£150
* Coworking space: ¬£40 at yellow but can vary a bit
* Lifts: ¬£2-3 each ride

# Practical Bits

* Arrival: You need to transfer airports in Bangkok (Suvarnabhumi to Don Mueang) then Don Mueang to Chiang Mai. You get a complimentary 40 min transfer by shuttle bus for Suvarnabhumi to Don Mueang if you present your flight ticket.
* Internet: Both 5G and WiFi are excellent throughout from Airbnb, coworking and the esmi
* Grocery shopping: Maya Mall is no cheaper than home (Europe) in price - Crocs are ¬£75 Rimping Supermarket mall is reasonable for Western food.
* When you land you MUST buy thai green balm and mosquito repellent spray it on all of your exposed limbs. I learned the hard way.
* The locals have limited English. With the best Engilsh being in the 18-25 age group so it is ideal to learn a few Thai phrases for thank you, hello/goodbye etc.

# Community & Crowd

* Lots of Korean and Chinese tourists and some locals. But not crowded and over touristified and not dead. Everyone seemed well behaved though.
* CAMP coworking library (Maya Mall) was mostly locals. There was more expats at Yellow Coworking if you are into networking as a English speaker.

# Regrets & Lessons

* It wasn't worth daily excursions for Western breakfasts. Could have made eggs, bacon, and toast at home for so much less.
* Length of stay: 5-7 days is enough time for an overview for the average tourist. One month is ideal if you work remotely.

# TL;DR

It is relaxed, affordable, safe, and a foodie heaven , if you are in Nimman. Perfect for slow travelers and remote nomads, but if you are just a tourist traveler, 5-7 days will suffice due to lack of activities which are mainly Buddhist temples, the nearby nature and hikes and zoo/safari.",3,1758378491.0,travel,1,1.0,False

He was extremely verbally abusive and had a say in anything I wanted to do. He went out of his way to control my schedule and ‚Äòallowed‚Äô me to have a night out once a month on his terms. At first he started sweet & was a very thoughtful partner but after 2 years, things started to change & slowly get worse. It was hard for me to understand my self worth & know that I needed to get out of it. Eventually I did, it was a very messy break up but overall the best decision I‚Äôve ever made, & my life has only improved since then. 

Now onto the confession. With such a messy break up, he proceeded to message me few times a week claiming I still had his stuff (which I didn‚Äôt, I would check) but then he did mention something that I did have, his spare key to his house. Now I had full intention on bringing it by & dropping it in his mailbox or hiding it on the front porch wherever he wanted it to be placed. But after telling him I did still have it, I proceed to get very hateful messages along the lines of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre such a bitch for keeping that, probably trying to plan out a robbery for revenge right?‚Äù & ‚ÄúI dare you to try and come over here, I will have a gun waiting for you to put a bullet between your eyes‚Äù. With those threatening messages he left me, I decided to reach out to his mom to leave the key with her for my safely. BUT not before I do something to harmless & petty right? 
My aunt works at a hardware store, really her idea but it was genius so I was here for it. She took the spare, made over 50 copies of this one key, proceeded to put a tags on each key of his name & phone number SO when it was found, the lucky person would get to call my exe to let him know he has dropped his house key. 
I LEFT THE KEYS EVERYWHERE. In a few fast food restaurants, target, local coffee shops, random parks, basically any place I remember I had the keys, I would simply leave one. This has went on for the last year & from what I‚Äôve heard, he has found only 20 from calls so far. He has no idea it‚Äôs me, he thinks it one of his family members that fucked it up. But I only have 10 keys left to hide & I‚Äôm hoping this will be a problem that goes on for at least 3 more years. 
Sometimes I do wonder if I had gone too far, but with what I went through & the emotional damage I am still healing from, this helps it heal a little faster. ",2,1758378274.0,confessions,13,0.55,False

\-Late 30's, short guy, never really hiked until a few years ago but I got into jogging and longer hikes (10-15 km) past few years and figured I could do something more intense

\-Been prepping for a month, minimum of 10-15 km hikes every day through conservation areas, tri-weekly 5 mile runs

\-Wanted to do K & P (Kingston and Pembroke) trail for a while now, it's an old railroad bed and I figured my shoes were well broken in (Hoka Speedgoat 5) and could handle it in around 3 days from Clarendon to Kingston (89 km to the end, but I'd stop at 11 km just outside of town)

\-Haven't pack hiked in decades, borrowed most of my gear from my brother (Archeopteryx pack, sleeping bag, iso burner, single man tent, etc). Planned spots to camp at, but that didn't exactly work out

**What Happened:**

I started bright and early around 830 after getting dropped off. I brought my mini schnauzer for the hike, he comes with me regularly already and usually doesn't have problems. Oh boy was that stupid. He added around 4 extra lbs for the food alone, not to mention my 4L water jug was getting burned through quickly having to water 2 people regularly.

First 10 km I realized I should have trained with more weight. It was unusually hot this year, and the sweaty feet were starting to ache already. I guessed my pack weighed around 15 lbs, turns out when I got back I weighed it, and even minus the food I ate, the pack alone was 29 lbs. That doesn't include the 4L of water either.

First campsite was supposed to be at \~34 km. By 25, I knew that wasn't happening, and started looking for somewhere to bed down for the night. Made it to 30 km and found a perfect spot, pitched the tent and made some tvp chili. Bandaged my blistered feet, wondering how they were so bad considering I had proper socks, broken in shoes, and really had only doubled my usual daily. I went through \~6.5 L of water, getting a refill in a small hamlet s. of Sharbot. I did NOT have any water purification with me, which would prove to be very stupid.

Got up early day 2, around 5:45 to a beautiful morning. Water was worrying me, as I only have about 500 ml after coffee and watering the dog, but Cole Lake wasn't that far & I figured I could make it. Feet hurt, but I was still making decent pace, and a good Samaritan watering his garden filled my 4L around 830 am. The stretch through Tichborne is beautiful, great views and rock cuts. The water was a double edged sword; critical to have, but using a 4L water jug meant adding another 8 lbs to my already heavy weight.

By noon, the sun was in full bore. Weather was supposed to cool down but that didn't happen, it was scorching. The sweat made my blisters continue to get worse, and every hour or so I'd feel the blisters pop, shooting pain though my feet and further slowing my pace. By 2:30, my pace had dropped from 4.8 km/h to 3 km/h. I realized i would probably not make it to Harrowsmith, and was basically limping. My dog started protesting too, as he was feeling the pain as well, constantly trying to lay down on the side of the trail when I needed to keep moving. I was giving him lots of treats and water, even dousing him to keep him cool, but it added more stops to an already delayed pace.

Around 3 pm I checked the map and I was 2.7 km from Verona. Between my mangled feet, poor exhausted dog, and sweltering late summer heat, I knew that was it. I didn't want to lodge in Verona so I decided to call it quits and called my ride to meet me in Verona. Even if I found a place to stay, I knew I couldn't make the pace the next day. 

Now began the last most brutal hike of my adult life. Shambling along, despairing at how slowly I was going, I limped forward a couple hundred meters at a time. I was inspired by a whip thin older man casually jogging the trail, clearly at complete ease. Thinking he might have started like me at some point, it inspired me to sack up and get to it. I kept the map open the whole time, utilizing my version of zeno's paradox; just get halfway to your destination, then the next halfway is only half that. I stumbled into Verona finally and flopped down at the gas station.

Taking off my shoes for the first time in hours, my socks were soaked in blood and pus. I had some previous Achilles heel blisters that had re-opened and bled all over the place. Max (my dog) flopped under the plastic chairs and slept until my ride arrived. I had covered 50 Km in 2 days, and while I DNF my plan, I learned a lot about my capabilities and can't wait to try again.

  
**What I Learned:**

1) I should have READ THIS SUB more! I didn't even weigh my pack before leaving. It was 30 lbs!! (Not including water) for a 3 day hike at most, way too much weight. I had been training with a 10 lb pack (at most), and this extra weight killed me.

2) While I love my dog to death, I felt terrible dragging him through those last few hours. Homeward Bound really lied to me, no way a 22lb dog could cross America. There's not a lot of info available on the web for dog hiking distance, and the harness really started to chafe him by the end. He might have to stay home unless I'm planning for shorter distances per day.

3) I wasn't as hungry as I thought I would be, either. I brought peanuts, gummy bears, tvp dried chili, and oatmeal. Barely ate 1/4 of the dried food, and got completely sick of peanuts on the first day. Normally I wouldn't eat at all on my training hikes, & this lack of experience added extra weight I didn't need.

4) I should have seasoned my feet better. I got lazy in my training, and wasn't pushing my limits. When I did, all the problems popped up and I might have been more prepared to handle the blisters and pain. My legs are not even sore, so at least that part held up. If I could have magically fixed all the foot pain, I feel I could have easily finished.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1nlzbhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dudeism/comments/1nlzbhs/abiding_freedom/,Abiding Freedom,"Hey Dudes!

I came upon a quote from Jean-Paul Sartre that hit home with me. He wrote: 

‚ÄúFreedom is what you do with what‚Äôs been done to you.‚Äù

I thought this to fit right in there with The Dude‚Äôs ethos. 

Unlike Walter, who‚Äôs living in the past (be it with Cynthia or within 3,000 years of beautiful tradition), or the Nihilists, who reject the past along with everything else, but then become petulant when things don‚Äôt work out their way, or the Big Lebowski and Maude who deny their identities (a trophy husband who has no money of his own and a trust fund baby living a bohemian life, respectively)‚Ä¶

The Dude accepts everything that happens to him, then makes the best choice he can given the limits of his situation. As Viktor Frankl would say, freedom isn‚Äôt freedom from limitations; freedom is freedom within one‚Äôs limitations. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a coincidence that one of the books on The Dude‚Äôs coffee table is Sartre‚Äôs ‚ÄúBeing and Nothingness‚Äù. The Dude gets it. On an existential level. 

The Dude‚Äôs free not because he‚Äôs exempt from the contingencies of existence. The Dude‚Äôs free because he accepts those contingencies. He knows he‚Äôs a deadbeat, as that goldbricking Lebowski labeled him. And how does he respond?

He abides, Dudes. He abides. 

I hope yer all abiding as well as you can,

Tried a lot of different recipes and today I tried an immersion brew with the pulsar. Regular grind for pour over, quick bloom + wdt, then filled to the top and let it sit for 8 minutes. All water was added with the distribution lid on.

My most enjoyable brew so far! Super sweet, no burnt tastes. Some florals, this coffee isn't that floral. I have a washed gesha I need to try this with.

1nlza2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1nlza2f/procrastination/,Procrastination.,"Even though there is really not much to procrastinate. It's kind of funny how I'm always trying to work  weeks ahead in class, but on the weekends I know what I need to do I just need to take a few hours to hype myself up first. I should really write out a list so that I don't forget anything. Even though it's mostly the basic stuff. Like laundry, cleaning, meal prepping. Pretty boring. I guess boring isn't bad though. Actually, my favorite holiday is just about here, so there's plenty to look forward to. 

I kinda hate that we meet only once a week. Is that silly? I get why, and I also get that I do have the ability to just show up and try to chat for a minute after school, I just feel weird doing that. I try to detach from everything because I know that I can't do it forever. It's better in the long run I think, but also maybe not even super necessary in the moment because I've never been too openly clingy to anyone, and it is good to live in the present. I don't know, lol. Lmaoooo I'm gonna be a weird for a second and admit that when you talk to me or praise me it's like nicotine and I can't even describe how amazing and completely consuming it feels lmaooooo. Sorry to be weird like that. I guess the feeling of being seen is good coming from anyone, but it's more than that with you. I still don't get why. 

I don't know. Back to being a semi-normal and functional human being. This week is gonna be awesome. My holiday, school, class. I wanna drone on and on about, and maybe I will at some point, or on Wednesday a little bit. Idk. I'm super excited because my aunt dropped off some new traditional clothes. So I need to look at ways to drape a dupatta and make sure that I have time to practice before the weekend Garba. I think I'm gonna slide in some extra little treats for myself this week. Coffee from that place near tops. Maybe make some chai at home, which I've been too lazy to do. I've obviously gotta paint my nails and practice my mehendi. If it fades before the weekend I'll just go over it. I really hope that my knee doesn't give out while I'm dancing. I'm pretty sure I won't be able to walk for a week afterward. It'll be worth it. I still need to call a doctor again though. 

FUCK. FUCK FUCK FUCK. I just realized that my financial aid does not cover this semester. I need to add submitting an appeal to my to do list. And I need to wait for my family because I need to have documentation for why I needed an extra semester. I hope it's not too late and that it goes through. Even if it does I'll still be down a couple hundred bucks. But it's better than being down over 4 grand. Why the fuck didn't I look into this before? I'm so fucking stupid.
