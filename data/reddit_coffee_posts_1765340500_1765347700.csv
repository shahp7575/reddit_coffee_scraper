Should I ask her directly or meet in person?,"I’ve been texting this girl for about a week straight. Nothing deep, nothing inappropriate, just casual stuff about life, random topics, jokes, etc. Normally, I’m against getting too attached this early because I prefer to get to know someone slowly, but I’m noticing that I am getting attached. Mostly because she sometimes texts me first, which isn’t something I’m used to.

Here’s the issue: I want clarity before this goes any further.

I don’t want to keep texting for weeks or months without knowing what she thinks about me. I don’t want to end up being the one who accidentally breaks someone’s heart, and I also don’t want to get friendzoned after getting emotionally invested. Basically, I want to know now whether she sees this as just a friendship or something with potential.

I’m interested in her romantically if she is, but if she only sees me as a friend, I’m totally fine with that too. I just don’t want to waste either of our time by sending mixed signals. I'm also trying to be as objective as possible in dealing with this situation. For context, i met this oerson through a friend group a couple of times, so I didn't just find this girl on the Internet.

My question is:
What’s the best way to bring this up?

Should I ask her directly over text?

**Gut feeling my (42F) husband (42m) is cheating with a parent in our kids scout troop and can’t focus or think of anything else**

&#x200B;


My (42F) husband (42M) is gone for the weekend chaperoning our kids on a scout outing…and I just can’t focus right now. I have a gut feeling telling me that he is having an affair with another parent (43F) in the troop two of our kids (14M, 12F) are in.

We’ve been married for 15 years, together for 17 years and have 3 kids (14M, 12F, 8M). In that time, I’ve never had any feeling that he wasn’t faithful until this week due to a comment from another parent at this month’s parent meeting. I don’t remember exactly how she said it, but the gist of it was that if she didn’t know better, she’d think my husband and this other parent really were married. This isn’t the first time those comments have been made, but it never bothered me when my husband told me about those comments in the past. But those comments were never said in front of me, and it triggered doubt that I just can’t overcome and made me question my trust in my husband.

We’ve known this other parent for years since her oldest (also 14M) has been in scouts and other activities with our oldest since they moved to the area about 7 years ago. She is married, but I don’t know how long they’ve been married. We never see her husband at awards nights, band concerts, or other events, and she’s made some comments in the past that make me wonder about how healthy her marriage is.

She is also a leader in the troop, and until they joined a mixed-gender troop pilot last year, were pretty much the only active leaders who could take the scouts on campouts and other activities. For anyone who isn’t familiar with scouting rules, a minimum of two-deep adult leadership is required for any meetings or outings, and the other adult leadership in the troop often had conflicts that prevented them from going. So if my husband and this other parent didn’t go, there would be no outing for our kids. There were two years where they were also the only two adults taking 4 scouts to the week-long summer camps.

He has also had her contact pinned on his phone because they text frequently. Those text usually seem to be about scouting-related stuff. Our kids and I are also pinned and at the top of his list…so I don’t think he’s prioritizing her over me.

There are more active leaders now that they did the mixed-gender pilot, but the other leaders are mostly women. My husband gets along with all of them pretty well, although they are the ones who make comments about them being married.

I tried talking to my sister (40F, Married) about this tonight, but she just fed into it. She wanted me to push for an open marriage like her so she could have a wingman. But…we’re completely different people, and I don’t want her lifestyle.

Am i overreacting? Or is there something there that I’m not seeing?

Update: First, thank you to everyone who has commented so far. I’ve had a night to sleep on this and think about it and some of the comments or questions I received.

First, I do plan to talk to my husband about this. He texted me this morning and wants to do a movie date night for the two of us tomorrow night when he gets back. Movie nights usually end with us having sex…

So I plan to talk to him about how that comment made me feel, and a few of you gave me some ways to approach the conversation that doesn’t come across as defensive or accusatory.

He’s told me about those comments in the past, and it always seemed like a joke. I guess hearing it directly in a way that I didn’t interpret as a joke sent my mind down this path.

I’m just not comfortable being direct about it and asking if he’s having an affair. Aside from the scout meetings, he’s home every night. And our kids are with him at the meetings.

Second, the parent I’m concerned about isn’t on this weekend’s outing. I’m Facebook friends with her, and she made some posts that confirm she isn’t there.

Third, my husband is not trying to keep me away from the troop. He’s been encouraging me to get involved, as have some of the other leaders from the girls troop they merged with for the pilot.

Update 2: Ugh…some of you are sick. DMing me and asking about sex life is fine… I’m a little uncomfortable talking about bedroom stuff. But you’re getting way too graphic. I’m not here to get you off.

>OOP:
It’s not that I can’t talk to my husband. I don’t think we’ve ever had communication problems in the past. But I don’t want to ask him in a way that accuses him of cheating because it’s just a gut feeling. I don’t have any proof, and I could create the situation I’m trying to avoid.

>Following up on my last comment here where I said I wish I could be that direct. I was tired and anxious last night when writing this post and my reply.

>There is a lot more than just directly asking him if he’s having an affair. I don’t have any proof, just a gut feeling. My mom did something like that to my dad when I was 15. He wasn’t cheating, but that accusation blew up their marriage and led to both of my parents cheating on each other. And I don’t want to end up like my mom or sister. So thats why I can’t be that direct.

>If I had real proof, it would be different.

**Update - 2 days later**

&#x200B;

My anxiety was in overdrive on Friday night when I posted that I had a gut feeling that my husband was having an affair. You can read the original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/zaA0RBrhVK

Thank you to everyone who left a comment or sent me a private message to talk. I’m especially thankful for the comments from anyone with a scouting background.

I had already planned a vacation day for today since I have vacation I have to use up before the end of the year, so I wanted to provide some updates.

I wanted to answer a few questions that have popped up on the other thread to add some context.

A few people asked why I wasn’t involved in scouting and if there were things going on in my personal life that made me feel this way. I was more involved in scouting when my oldest was a cub scout with my husband, but as my oldest crossed over into Boy Scouts, the time commitment increased. I also don’t drive because I never got my license in high school, so my husband had to pick up the slack on that. He really wants me to be more involved since our troop is now a mixed-gender troop and our daughter also joined.

My job also gets in the way of a lot of things. I teach a 4K program in a private childcare center. That’s normally a lot of work, and it’s year-round. My summer is busier because public schools are out and we have more kids. But this year has been harder than normal. We have a new curriculum, a new assessment we have to do on every kid, and the kids are harder because they’re either not prepared for my room or they have behavior challenges. I’m up until well after midnight most nights working on lesson plans or preparing for the next day’s activities. Although he tells me I shouldn’t work so hard if I’m not getting paid for it, my husband is mostly supportive of my job and will run errands for me and bring me coffee or lunch when I need it. Our local library will ask him questions about the books I put on hold for my classroom because he usually picks them up.

Some of you DMed me to ask about intimacy. I feel like my needs are being fulfilled. I wasn’t sure if his needs are since his sex drive has gone up over the last few years. He had some health issues and was put on high blood pressure medication about 5 years ago, and he worked hard to get off of them within a year. He lost weight and works out more.

After reading through a few other posts on here, I know this will come up. He does not go to a gym. He works out on our treadmill and with some dumbells in our basement.

But he has never complained to me about intimacy. He knows about some things in my past and doesn’t push. I’m sure he wants it more, but I’m not spontaneous and it’s hard to find time when you have 3 kids and a job that takes all your time. That said, I am quite pleased with our sex life.

My husband was on a weekend scout outing with two of our oldest kids when I made that post, and he didn’t get back until later yesterday afternoon. I had a chance to talk to him and the troop’s scoutmaster yesterday.

The scoutmaster called me yesterday afternoon because she had a question about the shirt sizes my kids needed for the new activity shirt they’re ordering, and my husband was out of cell service at that time. During that conversation, I mentioned that the “married couple” comment that was made at the last parent meeting made me uncomfortable. She understood and says she has been trying to stop that. I asked her some questions about my husband and this other parent, and she said that they’re more like brother and sister than a married couple. She says they joke around, but she hasn’t seen anything that looks like flirting between them. They will sit next to each other at meals when the adults eat together, but she doesn’t see anything that makes her think anything is going on.

I talked with my husband last night. I approached the conversation by raising my concern about the married couple comments. He understood and said that he didn’t like them either. He knows that I can have some anxiety issues.

I asked if I could look through his phone. He allowed me to. I looked at their text history, and I didn’t see anything that would concern me. Their texts were all about scouting, a few book recommendations, a text or two about crowdfunded backpacking or hiking gear, and a text thread about some advice for a car issue she was having last year when her husband wasn’t around.

He also let me look through his other apps. His job involved stuff with computers before he got laid off, so he had a few apps like Slack and WhatsApp. He showed me WhatsApp, and the only messages were with people that are his former coworkers. He also had Signal, which was locked with FaceID. He opened it without hesitation, and the only two conversations were with former coworkers who did something with computer security.

My husband also showed me his ipad and kindle. I didn’t see anything on his iPad that concerned me. When I looked at his kindle, I learned that he liked reading what he called “cozy romance novels” or “Hallmark movies in book form.” Our date nights usually involve a Hallmark movie or two, and he told me that he had to research books before borrowing them from the library or buying them on Amazon because he’s been surprised by how graphic some of the books get when the summary sounds extremely innocent.

After that, I asked him a question that I probably shouldn’t have. But the DMs I received and another reddit post here made me curious. I asked him if he masturbated. He said he did, and he does it in the shower. My husband takes long showers, so that filled in that gap.

Then I asked him who he thought about when he did that. He said he mostly thought about me. Sometimes he thought about two musicians/actresses. It feels weird to actually post their names in a thread so I won’t say their names, but one was a late 90’s pop star who is now an actress (and voiced a Disney princess) and the other is a violinist.

After a few moments of silence, he also admitted that he had a fantasy about that other parent and had thought of her in the shower.

I wasn’t thinking when I asked my next question. It just kind of came out. I asked if he was attracted to her. There were a few more moments of awkward silence before he said he was.

But he also said he recognized that attraction and set some hard boundaries for himself. He says he has kept his texts to scouting-related/adjacent topics and books (except for the one where he gave her car advice…that was just a text and he never went over there to help her because he was with me that entire day), doesn’t get into situations where he is alone with her, and just treats her like a friend. The only time he has been to her house is when he was picking her son up for scouting events, and he sat in the car in the driveway while our kids went to the door. He does not meet with her outside of scouting, and when we see them at school band concerts or other school events, we rarely talk with her.

He also said that he is more attracted to me than anyone else and that he has made a conscious choice to not act on any feelings besides the feelings he has for me.

Since I had asked him about other people, he also asked me if I had been attracted to anyone. I admitted that I think I am attracted to the parent of one of the kids I teach. He knows that I only speak to these parents for like 5 minutes a day in the chaos of drop off and pickup and that I don’t connect with parents on social media until after their kids are out of my class. He didn’t try to make me feel bad about it, and he said he only asked because I had asked that question of him.

So that is where we are at. I think I’m feeling insecure about myself because this other parent looks like I used to before I had kids. She’s skinny. She runs marathons and backpacks and shares some interests with my husband. But he’s enthusiastic about spending time with me and meeting all of my needs. And he’s home every night with me and has always had location sharing turned on for me so I can always see his location.

Update: I should clarify something here. When I asked the scoutmaster about my husband and this other parent, it was about how those married couple comments got started. She filled in the details about how they interact. But I never told the scoutmaster that I suspected him of cheating. Just that the comments that a 3rd parent made were making me uncomfortable. I told my husband that I had that a conversation about those comments with the Scoutmaster.

Update 2: I know the not driving thing is hard. And it’s not fair to my family. Can we please move on from that?

**Rice-Correct**

*Gonna be honest. It doesn’t sound like he’s cheating. It sounds like you both are honest with each other and have decent communication.
An unfortunate byproduct of honesty to direct questions and good communication is that sometimes, you might hear an answer that makes you feel a certain way. That’s what happened here.
We’re married. Not blind. We see other attractive people. It’s gonna happen. I know my husband finds some celebrities attractive because I’ve asked. This is fine. He’s probably never going to encounter them, and even if he did, I trust him. He’s not a cheater. I wouldn’t want to know, however, if he found one of our mutual acquaintances attractive. I’m not stupid. Some of them are! But I don’t want to hear him say it, so I don’t ask. And I don’t worry about it, because again, I trust him.
I think you need to learn to let all of this go. Go ahead and get involved in the scouting if you wish. Trust in the life you’ve built with your husband. He will find other people attractive now and then, as will you. But hot people don’t hold a candle to the one you’ve built a happy home and life with.*

**LittleCats_3**

*The only 2 things I would have a problem with are him masturbating to thoughts of her (that isn’t holding a hard boundary and is reinforcing sexual thoughts and fantasies about her), and what the other scoutmaster said about how they are always together. Creating healthy boundaries isn’t always sitting next to her for meals when there are other adults around, or having a close relationship where others would even joke about being a “married couple”. BOTH of those two things together is the problem. If he wasn’t attracted to her, and didn’t masturbate to thoughts of her then I wouldn’t have a problem with what the other scoutmaster said. He needs to create greater distance between them.
When he asked if you find anyone attractive and you admitted to being attracted to a parent of one of your students isn’t a fair comparison. He needs to imagine it’s a work colleague that you were with and only ate lunch with and still texted (even if innocently), one you fantasized about sexually and masturbated to.
No I don’t think he’s cheating, but this is a gray area that he needs to be careful with. There is a book called Not Just Friends by Shirley Glass that talks about emotional infidelity that you both should read. He’s still creating a closeness with her and then reinforcing those feelings thinking of her sexually. Our brains are powerful and can create intimacy with what we reinforce sexually.*



>OOP:
As I said in the last post, the current troop is one formed when Scouting America started a mixed gender pilot last year. My husband and the other parent were two of the most active leaders in the boys troop, and they were often the only two available to take the boys on campouts. So they worked very closely together for almost two years, and according to my husband, the married couple comments started because of how well they worked together.
What started this whole thing was when a different parent made a comment about it in front of me. My husband had told me about those comments in the past, but hearing it directly was different.





**LittleCats_3**

*Having someone randomly say your husband and a close friend are like a “married couple” is odd, and would have tripped my thoughts in the same way they tripped yours. I did read your first post, but this one really had the pertinent information in my opinion. So I do know that they’ve been close because of forced proximity being the two most involved scoutmasters. This other scoutmaster vs the parent, would have to actually be there to form this opinion about them, so they obviously aren’t always alone together.
My opinion is finding others attractive is normal, but we rarely need to create hard boundaries with someone we just find attractive. He felt the need to crate those boundaries, and I wish he had also talked to you about the boundaries and what was going on. He has taken this a step further and is also fantasizing about her sexually and masturbating to thoughts of her, which imo is not a hard boundary. I don’t think he needs to stop being a scoutmaster or stop being friendly with this woman, but he should stop eating sitting next to her, and he shouldn’t ever masturbate to thoughts of her again.
Most importantly he needs to start talking to you about these things.*

**Sub-UrbanMom**

*IMO I think the only 'yellow' flag is that ya'll rarely interact with her at school events - in other words 'when you are present'. If they are good friends there should be no reason to avoid each other. Not saying your husband is guilty but there might be some feelings on her part towards your husband that she avoids you. In other words: your husband sounds trustworthy, she does not. Tell your husband you trust him, but not her. He can be more careful when he interacts with her.*

>OOP:
she also seems distant at troop awards nights and parent meetings when I’m present too. she’ll sit on the opposite side of the room



**crazylady1260**

*That’s a huge red flag from both of them….yikes. He needs to separate from her at the troop things in respect for you…that’s emotional cheating especially if he’s mast. To her…*


>OOP:
I hadn’t really thought about her distance at other events until I heard this comment about them being like a married couple.

It’s the fact that I don’t know what they’re thinking when they stare is driving me up the wall , if they approached or I got approached then fine I can say oh you where interested. It’s the uncanny endless staring

I’m going insane bro 

Beauty is inherently very strange to me because from ages 18 to 20 I never left the house as in I was a complete hermit, no social contact, absolute isolation. Obviously my weight is also fluctuated, I have lost weight and it brought out my bone structure and a lot of other things for eg I lost baby fat, things of this sort. 

And last year I posted to Reddit assuming, and I genuinely thought I was the ugliest thing on earth, like genuinely. Obviously I was really chronically online at the time, that didn't help. So whatever perception I had was entirely skewed and I had no human to actually, gage what I was perceived as because I spoke to no one and was a complete hermit. So I assumed I was ugly, like fuck off ugly. I'm talking bottom two percent. Could you imagine my cognitive dissonance when people thought I was trolling on the subreddit? I got called a Raphaelite painting and of course the slew of modeling comments along with the infinitesimal amount of DMs. I just sat there in complete puzzlement, which it's been about a year and a half since then and since I ventured into the real world it's been a lot more aggressive in person. I don't really get sexually harassed or any of the negative sort, if that's what you're wondering. I guess my looks don't warrant that type of attention . It's more like awe / reverence/ intimidation/ shock or striking or just, you know, more like positive, I suppose. 

But I think it's specifically the city I live in. I don't know. I just feel really alone. I don't have any friends. I'm not with anybody. I try to use dating apps. It doesn't work. No one's serious on there. Nobody will even ask me for coffee bro. And there’s gonna be people from all places  reading this not understanding I live in LONDON. It’s not the same culture at all. The amount of foreign students who come here and find out real quick people here don’t socialise at all. 

I don't know. I mean, I could go into this forever but all I'm trying to say is having autism and dealing with this is absolute hell on earth. You know what I fucking wish? I wish to be a slightly above attractive woman who has a boyfriend who actually loves her, a degree that's actually respectable and a routine, like a job that pays good and she's good at. That is what I would have fucking wished for, not this hellscape that I'm currently living in where everything's a flop except for beauty. But does that even fucking matter? It just feels like it's rubbing it in my face. I don't know. And then I go out and it's like no one will ever approach. Though I understand with a lot of nuance why. Modern dating, certain movements , the death of third spaces, work not being appropriate places , the list goes on and on. No one will ever approach you and that's fine. And I live / born in a particularly very antisocial city so it's even worse, not in the culture. People are very aloof here and they literally just work and then they take the train home, that's it. But what I'm getting at is... It's diabolical, the staring with no action. It's driving me up a wall and I've now taken to wearing face masks in public. That is for me, it's like a stim at this point, like just wearing a face mask.

 I feel relieved. Though I still get fucking looked at, Jesus Christ. But at least then my face doesn't start twitching. I get literal tics. Now, I'm not saying I have Tourette's, but I get genuine tics. My spine goes ramrod straight. My eye actually starts uncontrollably twitching and watering. My head jerks.

I’m not sold I was colonized during the treatment, I suspect it was from antibiotics used earlier in the year to treat rosacea. 

Toward the end of my Rifaximin and Metronidazole for sibo, I started to get intermittent diarrhea and constipation, usually over a 4-5 day cycle. But then one day I had spicy food (oops, sichuan food) and suddenly developed the most deeply horrific diarrhea (??) that left me bed ridden and in shambles for 5-6 days. I’m not entirely sure it qualifies as diarrhea because it was like undigested chunks of food for two days (so effing unpleasant to pass with all the inflammation) and then mushy, oatmeal-y poo with tons of mucus and some blood for a few days, and then a taper off to constipation. 

Before the taper (in the throes of diarrhea) was when I spoke to my doctor who ordered a stool test. I picked up the test, but it was the week of thanksgiving so I waited to do it so the labs were open. It was around then that the loose stools (which were less painful by then, though I was essentially on a brat diet) stopped and I got intermittent constipation. This was when I took the stool test. After the test, I ended up with a full blown stop-up. 

And here I am. I haven’t gone in six days aside from one small, very incomplete bm after I pulled out all the stops: ginger tea, a 24 hour fast, 1000mg mag ox, 2 strong coffees and my prescribed adderall. The results came back today and I am positive for cdiff PCR and negative for toxin. I have elevated (abnormal at 126) calprotectin. 

1) I am really curious if I had a cdiff infection (the symptoms were nearly identical) and if I could have cleared my cdiff infection myself?
2) are there any explanations for my constipation that seems to not respond to 1000mg mag ox?
3) is there ANY benefit to treating cdiff without the active death diarrhea? I’m tempted to because I wonder if constipation is a symptom somehow (I’ve seen anecdotes of this being a lived experience for some people even if it’s not the norm)
4) could cdiff colonization cause methane dominant sibo?
5) I’m also losing a lot of hair which is a weird symptom and could be totally unrelated but had to mention it because it seems to correlate with gut issues.

He still doesn't know it's me pretending to be a voluptuous blonde who finds him irresistible, however we had a massive argument yesterday and I packed some things and am now staying in a hotel while I look for another place to live. I had a day off work yesterday and he ruined it. I woke up before him and found a coffee mug with the dregs of a red wine drinking session after I went to bed the night before. I had my suspicions before this but this confirmed to me he's back on the red wine. He is a sloppy unattractive drunk on red wine and I've told him this before.

Fast forward to today. He is blaming me (of course) for driving him to cheat and drink. I'll spare you the gorey details of the argument, suffice to say, I'm done. I didnt want it to end like this, I had planned to leave while he was away, having his imaginary tryst in Melbourne. I was a bit naughty though and suggested to him a few days ago, that I could get some time off work and come with him. He immediately emailed his AP (me), really upset that I might come and ruin his night of pleasure. So I played on it and watched him sweat for 2 days while I umm'ed and ahh'ed about whether I would like to go. I looked up the train timetable and told him of the available seats.

Anyway, he and his online lover (me) are still chatting and because she lives in Canada, I've suggested that he should come and visit me. The (pretend) hookup in Melbourne is with an (imaginary) friend of his online Canadian lover (me) and he still thinks it is going ahead on 28th December.

I know its wrong to keep this going, but I am going to until the grand finale on 28th when I decide how much of this to let him in on. I thought I might print all his emails and highlight the parts where he confides in his imaginary lver about things he's never told me, his wife. 

And I thought I would add all the billing receipts for the sexting site so he could see the more thst $6000 he has spent on sex chat and graphic photo swapping, while complaining about having no money, and have it sitting on the coffee table when he returns home.

I still haven't worked out the no show of the blonde escort ew thinks is going to knock on his hotel door and give him the best night of his life (his words).",3,1765346600.0,Infidelity,1,1.0,False
1piv318,https://www.reddit.com/r/chronicfatigue/comments/1piv318/cannot_function_without_9_hours_of_sleep/,Cannot function without 9 hours of sleep,"I’m posting because I really want to know if anyone else reacts **this severely** to even mild sleep deprivation, or if I should be pushing my doctors harder.

I consistently require **9 hours of sleep as my absolute minimum** to stay healthy. If I go below that, things go downhill fast.

**Crucial Point:** I have confirmed that the **only thing** that consistently triggers these severe illnesses for me is **lack of sleep**. No other factors—like dietary changes, intense exercise, or typical daily stress—cause this immediate, systemic breakdown.

# What Happens When I Get Less Sleep

**Initial Reaction (One Night):** If I get just **7–8 hours of sleep for a single night**, I feel immediate exhaustion and mild sickness. Specific symptoms include:

* My **eyes sting** and it becomes **painful to put in contact lenses.**
* My **gums will start bleeding**, and my **lips get chapped and bleed.**
* I'll have a **mini sore throat.**

**Full System Collapse (Cumulative Debt):** If I get **8 hours of sleep for just three nights in a row** (so, a total of \~3 hours of sleep debt), my body completely collapses and it takes a week to recover.

**Severe Symptoms:** It’s not just feeling tired. I develop:

* **Fever**
* **Severe Sore Throat**
* **Debilitating Nausea and Extreme Fatigue**
* **Intense body aches, especially in my back and neck.**

My doctors have suggested it might be an exaggerated **inflammatory response** to stress or lack of sleep, but it feels way beyond what’s typically described as “just stress.”

# My Concerning Reality & Medical Workup So Far

* **Background:** I’m a **23-year-old female**, normal BMI, eat healthy, and exercise regularly.
   * **Note on Sensitivity:** I have an unusual sensitivity to stimulants; for example, **one cup of coffee in the morning affects me for 18 hours.**
* **Extensive Testing:** I’ve seen **2 immunologists, an ENT, several primary care doctors, a hematologist, and sleep specialists.** I’ve had an extensive workup, including tests for common infections like EBV/mono – all negative or normal. My in-lab sleep study showed “textbook” sleep quality and efficiency.
* **Duration & Worsening:** This has been an ongoing issue for **4.5 years**, and the **sensitivity to lack of sleep gets worse every few months.**
* **Frequency/Severity:** In the **5 months since graduating college, I’ve had 12 intense viral illnesses.** Each one takes **at least a week** of being really sick in bed to recover.
   * **Contagion:** The viruses are **contagious** – others catch them from me – but most people recover in a couple of days, while I’m wiped out for much longer.
   * **Roommate Validation:** My **roommates hear how sick I get and are genuinely concerned.**
* **Recent Example:** I just got over a virus where I had a **103°F fever**, was **constantly coughing up phlegm**, **blowing my nose every 3-5 minutes**, had severe **back and neck pain**, and needed **11–12 hours of sleep per night** just to function.

# My Questions for the Community

1. **High Sleep Need/Severe Symptoms:** Has anyone else found that they need **9 hours of sleep just to stay healthy**, and experience this level of immediate physical breakdown from even minor sleep loss (like the **stinging eyes/bleeding lips**)? If so, what did you do about it?
2. **Underlying Cause:** Given the severity, the **worsening symptoms**, and the **stimulant sensitivity**, did anyone with a similar profile find an underlying medical issue? For example, an **autoimmune issue** or something that didn't show up on bloodwork?
3. **Building Resilience:** Any advice on building more “resilience” so I don’t crash so easily? Right now it feels like even small amounts of sleep debt flip a switch straight into “full-blown illness.”

The fact that a small deviation can trigger what feels like a serious illness makes normal life (work, travel, holidays, social events) extremely hard.

1piv2dd,https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1piv2dd/incoherent_rambling_on_soft_wet_plunder_go_beyond/,Incoherent Rambling on Soft & Wet & Plunder & Go Beyond,"**Plunder.** Without fully re-reading all of Jojolion I cannot find an origin for Plunder as a term. As far as I can tell the first use of the word Plunder, in an official piece of JJBA media, is in All Star Battle-R in Josuke's move list. So while Plunder is a nice term, Soft & Wet taking things away seems to be the exact same as when it holds an object in a soap bubble, just instead with something abstract. Using this logic one could argue holding physical objects counts as a 'Plunder', or that 'Plunder' simply does not exist at all. If there is a proper origin to Plunder as a term please source one.

**Josuke's Use of Plunder.** A major complaint of Jojolion is the disappearance of Plunder. Whether or not Josuke uses it to the fullest potential is one thing, but it never really left, taking a backseat at most during the Blue Hawaii arc, where there 3 more fights Josuke takes major part in. Plunder itself also has limitations, the soap bubble has to physically touch the person or object it wants to take something from or place something on. On non-stand users this would be fine since they can't see the bubbles but stand users will be able to see the bubbles and I think they won't want to be touching the enemies bubbles. Another limitation is that despite not technically being bubbles they still adhere the the physics of being bubbles, although seemingly more durable. That said Josuke is able to move and direct the bubbles through open air, but they don't seem especially fast, and I don't think we ever see it, but I think a strong wind would be able to blow a freely floating bubble away.

**Almost Every Major Use of Soap Bubbles and Plunder.** Josuke uses Plunder against Fun Fun Fun numerous times, to take sound and friction. Against California King Bed he once again Plunders sound to try and trick Daiya. In the Born this Way arc Josuke uses Plunder to move hair around, but once the fight starts he doesn't use Plunder once while fighting, this is because the crux of this fight was Josuke have to exhibit his physical prowess while trying to figure out the nature of the enemy stand. The freezing temperature also made his bubbles freeze and brittle. But after the fight is over Josuke uses a Plunder bubble to track Kei as the user by putting smells in it. During Shakedown Road Josuke tries to use his bubbles to find out whats inside the package but can't fit the bubbles inside without disturbed the package, but he does get the scent and sound of the contents using his bubbles, and he also uses his bubbles to carry the leaves and money to switch their places. 

Against I am a Rock he uses bubbles to separate himself from the stones digging into him, then Plunders the moisture from the chestnuts. Then he 'Plunders' the entirety of Yotsuyu, he then uses bubbles to keeps the pesticides from getting into him and to store words to speak from underwater. He also took the air from Yostuyu's lungs by putting bubbles inside him. When competing with Jobin he used Plunder to carry pheromones and heat to get an edge in the stag beetle battle, and to set off the sprinklers to escape later. Josuke also used bubbles to defend his beetle from damage, he also transported the car key in a bubble. When Josuke first gets in contact with Karera he uses a bubble to refract light so he can read her ID. Once he starts fighting the A. Phex brothers he uses bubbles to take fire from Karera's body. He places a bubble inside A. Phex brother 1's face which is the first use of a Killer Queen bubble. He takes nuts and bolts in bubbles and shoots them at the brothers, and he uses bubbles as a shield to block Schott key no.2's acid from touching his face and again another time to hold acid for later. 

Agaisnt Vitamin C Josuke uses bubbles once to seemingly try to stabilize himself as he becomes melty. We also see the second use of a Kira bubble when he destroys Damo's glasses. Josuke uses a bubble to put Hato outisde the the Higashikata home. Josuke also uses Plunder to transport his voice to Hato. Josefumi uses Plunder 3 different ways during this arc. The first time is to remove the black pepper from his ramen. The second time was when he removed the gap between the branches to graft them. The third time was when he put pieces of Locacaca in bubbles to feed to Kira. He also uses bubbles to make Aisho think some eyedrops work, he also uses them to break a branch while fighting the A. Phex brothers.

Blue Hawaii, this fight is the first one where Plunder wouldn't prove very useful. Josuke isn't very interested in harming the innocents anymore than he has to, while he probably could easily land a plunder bubble on a zombie they already auto track blindly toward him and thus would likely do nothing. This fight is similar to Born This Way in that Josuke has to use his physical prowess and ability in creative ways instead of fighting directly. Josuke does still Plunder in this fight, like when he carries coffee to splash on the kid and to inspect the to keep the tooth in the letter. He uses bubbles to carry a shovel up to himself, he also uses bubbles as a physical barrier so he can make physical contact without touching a zombie. Josuke uses Soft & Wet to burst a water bottle to make a shield, and also uses bubbles to lift a zombie off their bike so he can take it.

Against Brain Storm Josuke does Plunder some of the stand but this isn't very useful because it's a tiny swarming stand. Josuke also can't use plunder against Urban Guerilla because he spends most of the fight hiding. Soap bubbles are used to lift Yasuho and himself on seperate occasions. Most of this fight Josuke is trying to plant Killer Queen bubbles to get to Urban Guerilla. Josuke plunders gasoline and brings it underground to use there. Ozon Baby is probably the fight where Plunder attacks are least useful given the circumstances, even if Josuke used a plunder on Poor Tom that wouldn't stop the pressure increase which was the main threat. Josuke makes bubbles around himself and Mamezuku to guard against the increasing pressure. Josuke carries some poison berries to forcefeed Poor Tom, then Josuke layers bubbles inside themselves to play mind games with Poor Tom and make him deactivate his stand. And Josuke also uses bubbles to hold Doctor Wu to suffocate him at the very end of that fight.

Wonder of U. I don't think I even need to say why Plunder wouldn't be as useful here. Josuke uses bubbles to shield Yasuho from a car that hit her, and to give her a soft landing. Josuke also attempts to use bubbles to shield himself from the angry bystander before he died of a calamity. Once again Josuke attempts a bubble shield to protect from the piercing rain. He then pops two bubbles on a cops head to incapacitate him. Josuke places soap bubbles 'stored severel things spun at very high speeds' all around the room that he lured Wonder of U to, he also uses soap bubbles to push down on Dododo, De Dadada. Then the Go Beyond bubble shows up.

**Go Beyond and it's Power.**  Go Beyond is a soap bubble made of a string that is so infinitely small that it doesn't exist and therefore can overcome logic and reason. This is how it bypasses calamity. But Josuke seemingly has no way of aiming this bubble in any conventional manner. So while a Go Beyond bubble should be able to bypass the D4C Love Train barrier and GER RTZ and cause harm, it's unlikely Josuke will be able to get this hit Go Beyond on them. Also there is a Go Beyond bubble in chapter 1 and the ability is foreshadowed in chapters 70 and 100

**The Important Section (tldr).** Given the dubious nature of Plunder as a term (or until I'm proven wrong on that) Plunder in the way of simply carrying something abstract or a physical object in a bubble is used in almost every fight. Plunder does take a backseat around the Vitamin C and Blue Hawaii arc, due to the fact the stands and users don't accommodate for it's use. But it is still very much present and is traded off for Josuke being a lot more creative in the use of his stand and his own physical ability. Similar to how Giorno's hyper sense and damage reflection weren't used in battle in any meaningful way. Just that happened far earlier in part 5 and wasn't used in smaller ways like Plunder.

I'm still the same shape as when I was pregnant, I'm 93kg (218lbs) and it's mainly belly fat and a bit of junk in the trunk.

I've tried:

1. **Yogi / keto style diet** and walking 10,000 to 18,000 steps a day and eating raw food at 11am and cooked foods at 6pm. I got down to 88kg and plateaued, then started mucking up my diet by cooking to increase protein for my 11am meal to have post my big walks everyday. Shot back up to 93kg.
2. **Shake based diets** which caused dehydration and headaches. I worked with the lady I was buying the shakes and things from. She said I drank WAY too much coffee to lose weight. (\~3 standard lattes a day at the time, no sugar). Gave up due to the headaches and no weight change.
3. **Dietician:** said I wasn't eating enough and should aim for six small meals a day to prevent end-of-day binges. Said prolonged dieting had likely interrupted my BMR and I should ensure I was adding carbohydrates to my meals to feel fuller for longer. No change in weight, stopped because all day everyday seemed to be orientated around food.
4. **Mindy Pelz Fast Like a Girl** this suited me because I don't like eating anyway... I didn't lose any weight and I mucked it up twice and both events were incredibly painful. 1. MCT Oil is not for beginners. 2. I done a 24 hour fast and didn't have my post fast meal ready and thought I could break fast on a salad before going to buy the right food - I was incredibly wrong!
5. **Personal Trainer:** also said I wasn't eating enough and he has me calorie counting to increase my BMR. I'm always so sore and embarrassed during and after weight training. Struggling with tiny weights, doing not much for an hour followed by days of soreness. My mistake today was I was busy with Christmas shopping and had only had two cups of coffee for the day and rocked up to lift at 1pm and felt faint, nauseas and light-headed and went home 20 minutes later. I'm not done with this but I also don't see the path forwards.

I'm 35F and Mindy Pelz has pretty well struck fear into me that ""it's so hard to lose weight once you're past 40 and your hormones become menopausal"". So I'm trying like hell to lose weight now!

1piuyam,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1piuyam/aita_for_leaving_my_friends_wedding_dress/,AITA for leaving my friend's wedding dress shopping trip early after finding out at the dinner table I wasn't a bridesmaid?,"So I (32F) have known this friend (32F) since middle school. Let's call her Fran. We've drifted a bit over the years- life, distance, careers in different industries, my own healing journey- but I've always considered her a chosen sister. Any time we hung out, even if just once a year, always felt like old times. And even though we didn't talk all too much, I always valued her friendship.

Fran got engaged earlier this year. When I saw her in August, she asked me if I would be willing to fly out (\~3 hour flight) to go wedding dress shopping with her and her best friend from elementary school. During that convo, she told me I was the perfect person to go wedding dress shopping with, talked to me about what color her bridesmaids dresses should be (sage, not mint or emerald) and asked what we should do for her bachelorette. After coffee, she would even send me photos of outfits for the rehearsal dinner.

So I assumed I would be in the bridal party. Not that I think this is owed or expected, but because of how she was talking to me about her wedding.

I spent $500 on flights to go wedding dress shopping (in the middle of the government shutdown, mind you). There were two appointments for Saturday and one for Sunday. I came in Friday night, while the other girl was coming in Saturday morning.

Fast forward to after the Saturday appointments. There's seven of us (significant others, siblings). Her brother, at the pizza joint communal table, casually asks ""So what's your job in the wedding? I assume you're a bridesmaid"". And Fran goes, ""Oh.... she's actually not...."" in front of everyone. No private convo, no heads-up. A public no.

It was so awkward I still cringe thinking about it. Later that night, she said ""I just want to acknowledge how awkward my brother made dinner"". News flash, he didn't make it awkward. I basically told her I wasn't mad that I wasn't a bridesmaid, if I didn't make the cut it's fine, but it was the approach in which how I was told. I could have been told Friday night prior to the other girl coming in. I could have been told Saturday morning when we spent the whole morning together. But I wasn't. I wasn't told prior to booking a $500 flight and spending $100 on Ubers to get to her and celebrate her that weekend. This conversation evolved into her telling me ""she just can't come to me for big things anymore"" and she's felt extremely distant to me for years. YEARS.

So I'm sitting there like... then why am I here?

I was really hurt and spent the night and morning crying, so I booked an earlier flight home on Sunday and skipped the final dress appointment. I didn't want to show up puffy eyed and have it be awkward. As I left (obviously putting everything away), I texted her and her fiancé ""Woke up with a sore throat, decided to take an earlier flight home. Thanks for opening up your home to me"" and she responds HOURS later saying ""hope you feel better. thanks for coming up this weekend.""

Since then, radio silence. She didn't even text me a happy birthday or happy Thanksgiving.

For the record, I genuinely am not mad about not being a bridesmaid. I'm hurt because she let me fly out and emotionally show up for her, and then humiliated me in a public setting (and also insisted we go out to a bar AFTER dinner).

So, AITA for leaving early and not reaching out first?",14,1765346150.0,AITAH,15,0.89,False

So just for context, I am 1.5 months into my new job and have never talked to this lady. She sits nearby but we don't work with one another. 

So while I was getting my coffee I realised that she was going to go next and I apologised. 

Her: ""Wow you're so tall""

Me: Not looking, smiled and said ""yea I get that alot"". (Normal compliment so far so good.)

Her: ""Hey you look very much like a model. You should consider it""

Me: Gave a quick look behind, laughed and said nah cannot la. (Weird compliment, can't tell if serious but ok sure.)

Her: ""You're so young looking too, you look 22 or 23"" (If I had to guess shes in her mid to early 30s and I'm in my mid to late 20s.)

Me: I laugh again and now I turn around and we lock eyes. I tell her my age. (Where is this going? You're being too flirty.)

Her: She said while not breaking eye contact, ""haha omg you're so young, you should *really* try modelling."" (She actually emphasized on the really. Ok wtf is happening right now? Are you actually hitting on me?)

At this point the sexual tension is abit too heavy and getting too awkward for me so I thanked her and quickly made my way back to my desk. 

And I know what you're thinking: She's just being nice and making small talk. But it really didn't feel that way at all. Its not like the ""shuai ge"" you get from the drink stall auntie. Not one bit. I could really feel intent behind her compliments. Much like how a guy would go about hitting on a girl by complimenting her looks and body. And if the roles were reversed, it could definitely count as harrassment for a girl.

But on the other hand she is also european so it might just be a cultural thing. Am I overthinking or am I really being hit on? If so ima smash.

i’ve been at this store for a couple months now and since i’ve been here there’s things that i haven’t really able to say much about until a couple weeks ago. 

when i first got here and started closing i was told that we needed to fill the ice bins (after cleaning them even though i was told after you clean them at night you leave them empty), do the sandwiches and pastry cart and a bunch of other things for mornings. i didn’t raise my eye too much at first because we’re a slower store but i was still like “why can’t mornings do this?”. now because we’re a slower store we only have 2 person plays for 5+ hours at a time which means closes have been extremely difficult. 
ontop of 2 person closes, morning crew does essentially nothing much to help us out i feel. the trash in the back is constantly overflowing when i get to my shifts at like 14:00-16:00(2pm-4pm), there’s constantly messes on bar and minimal preps are done. i know mornings can be extremely busy but ive worked in the morning at this store. there’s more partners on the floor in the morning and they have the hands to be able to get this stuff done before i get in. especially when i’ve seen some baristas just chatting when i get on the floor. ontop of the trashes stuff like ovens and turn over are hardly ever done unless i get on the floor or if certain partners i trust at least started it. 

when i got to this store the refreshers + lemonade were dated wrong every single day i went in. they would date the refreshers like the teas and iced coffee and date it the night off and clean the containers and leave them empty at the end of the night. i told my manager it was a waste of product and it was wrong. i also had correct them on dating them in the fridge. the morning shift did not believe me at all and would not listen until her favorite barista told her how it was. (even though they could’ve checked the shelf life like where i said it was). 

there are shifts who just snap and are in general rude to my other coworkers (one literally made one of my coworkers cry on the floor yet the proxy manager and shift are blaming and trying to get my partner in trouble) and standing up for my partners is just insane to have to do. i feel like i shouldn’t have to tell grown adults to calm down and not be so rude to baristas? i thought we were adults here. 

ever since ive been at this store closing there’s one shift who has not liked any single one of the closes. everyday i hear complaint after complaint about stuff morning crew can easily do in the morning. she left nasty and rude notes towards my main closing shift for awhile and it got extremely out of hand. morning crew is constantly shit talking me and keeps trying to talk to me like we’re cool. i am cordial and respectful but it’s getting harder knowing i’ve had to call people out on standards and properly dating things yet my preps are constant complaints. it’s getting exhausting. 

this one barista keeps talking bad behind my back and keeps talking to me like i don’t know and it’s genuinely frustrating, i do not want to work with them. i can keep cordial and respectful for small periods of time but working with them really irritates me. 

i have partners on the floor i can talk to about this stuff but it doesn’t make it any less frustrating or upsetting to go to work.

im getting recognized for the work that i do for this store. i’m getting a promotion to shift. but i don’t know how long im gonna be able to stay at this store because of how rude most of these baristas and shifts are. it’s making me dread and hate going into work.

1piuurd,https://i.redd.it/ydkysr50fb6g1.png,Best Foods to Eat Before and After a Workout,"# Introduction

The selection of foods consumed before and after workouts is a crucial factor that significantly contributes to increasing energy, enhancing performance, and facilitating muscle recovery. It does not matter if your goal is to lose fat, build strength, or gain lean muscle; the nutrition around training is equally important as the workout itself. A lot of athletes, besides eating right, also use the most reliable [fitness and muscle-building supplements](https://evolvebiolabs.com/) to double their results. In this blog, you will find out about the best foods to consume before and after a workout, the impact of these foods on your body, and how to create meals that are in line with your fitness goals.

# 1. [**Why Pre- and Post-Workout Nutrition Matters**](https://medium.com/@evolvebiolabs07/pre-workout-vs-post-workout-nutrition-what-you-really-need-to-know-75873c2ca7f1)

Consuming proper foods prior to, and after your workout will fuel your body and help you perform better, aid in muscle recovery and growth, and help you get the most from every session.

* Pre-workout food provides energy to your body, delays fatigue, and maintains steady blood sugar levels. 
* Post-workout food helps rebuild muscle, diminishes soreness, and restores stored glycogen (energy).
* Eating appropriately can enhance performance, endurance, and recovery.
* In addition, eating appropriately can maximize the results, whether you are training for strength, fat loss, or endurance.

# 2. [**Best Foods to Eat Before a Workout**](https://medium.com/@evolvebiolabs07/pre-workout-nutrition-what-to-eat-before-a-workout-for-best-results-0f3c25456653)

Your pre-exercise meal should consist of easily digestible carbohydrate sources, a small amount of protein, and minimal fat (since fat slows digestion). Aim to eat 45–90 minutes before working out.

# 1. Bananas – The Quick Energy Booster

Bananas are a good source of quickly available carbohydrates and potassium, which facilitate the proper functioning of nerves and muscles. They give energy right away, which is why they are excellent before cardio or strength training sessions.

**Best paired with:** A spoon of peanut butter or whey protein shake.

# 2. Oatmeal – Slow and Steady Fuel

Oats are very high in fiber, and their digestion process takes a long time, giving you energy to last throughout the workout. Moreover, they are rich in B vitamins, which are known to provide good and fast energy from carbohydrate conversion.

**Best paired with:** Honey, berries, chia seeds, or Greek yogurt.

# 3. Whole-Grain Toast with Peanut Butter

A great combination of complex carbs and healthy fats that keeps you energized. This is ideal for morning workouts.

**Tip:** Add banana slices on top for extra carbs.

# 4. Greek Yogurt with Fruit

Greek yogurt delivers protein, whereas fruits offer carbohydrates. This combination will fuel your muscles and avoid a sudden crash in energy. 

**Best fruits:** Berries, apples, mango, pineapple.

# 5. Smoothies – Quick, Easy, and Light

Smoothies are great for anyone who wants a light yet filling snack.

**Great pre-workout smoothie mix:**

* Banana
* Oats
* Whey protein
* Berries
* Almond milk

# 6. Brown Rice with Chicken (For Heavy Training)

If you participate in vigorous physical activities or weight training, a light meal with carbohydrates and lean protein is optimal.

**Why:** Brown rice gives sustained energy while chicken supports muscle strength.

# 7. Black Coffee (Optional Energy Boost)

If you're looking for greater focus and stamina during your workout, coffee can help boost performance without adding calories.

**Tip:** Drink 30 minutes before a workout. Avoid taking on an empty stomach if you have acidity.

# 3. [**Best Foods to Eat After a Workout**](https://medium.com/@evolvebiolabs07/top-7-recovery-foods-after-a-hardcore-workout-08ea5663c4f7)

Post-workout nutrition is supposed to have top-notch protein, carbs, and a bit of healthy fat. To get the most out of your recovery, try to eat within 45 minutes of finishing your workout.

# 1. Eggs – The Perfect Recovery Food

Eggs are a source of complete protein and essential amino acids that help speed up muscle recovery. Eggs also support muscle growth.

**Best paired with:** Whole wheat toast or fruit for carbs.

# 2. Protein Shake with Fruit

A whey or plant-based recovery shake is an efficient, convenient option to enhance muscle recovery.

**Why add fruit?**

Fruits help restore glycogen and boost nutrient absorption.

**Best fruits:** Banana, mango, apple, berries.

# 3. Chicken Breast with Sweet Potatoes

A classic post-workout meal for muscle growth. 

**Benefits:**

* Chicken: lean protein for muscle repair
* Sweet potato: fast recovery carbs
* Rich in vitamins and antioxidants

# 4. Greek Yogurt with Honey

Greek yogurt is a source of protein and probiotics for muscle recovery and digestion. Honey provides natural sugar for energy replenishment.

# 5. Cottage Cheese (Paneer)

Paneer contains casein protein, which is slow-digesting, perfect for evening workouts.

**Tip:** Combine with fruit or a small serving of nuts.

# 6. Tuna or Salmon

Abundant in omega-3 fatty acids and lean protein.

**Benefits:**

* Reduces inflammation
* Supports muscle recovery
* Improves joint health

# 7. Quinoa Bowl

Quinoa is one of the richest plant-based options for post-workout nutrition.

**Why it's great:**

* High in protein
* Gluten-free
* Contains all essential amino acids
* Rich in fiber and minerals

# 4. Hydration: The Often-Ignored Key to Performance

Water plays a critical role in workout performance and recovery.

# What to drink before a workout:

* 1–2 glasses of water
* Add electrolytes if you're sweating heavily

# What to drink after a workout:

* Water
* Coconut water
* ORS (if dehydration is high)

# Meal Timing Tips for Best Performance

* Have a pre-workout meal 45–90 minutes before exercise: 
* If eating within 20–30 minutes of exercise, choose quick-digesting carbs. 
* Consume protein foods in the first 45 minutes after exercise. 
* Avoid heavy, oily meals before exercise. 
* Feeding for hydration should remain constant during the day. 

# Conclusion

The intake of proper food at the right times during and after exercise can coincide with the enhancement of performance, energy efficiency, and the recovery of muscles to a great extent. Opt for carbs before your workout to get energy, and eat proteins afterwards for the building and strengthening of your muscles. If you have adequate nutrition, your fitness objectives will become easier, quicker, and more successful.

**My (30f) husband (33m) accused me of murder, out of the blue. How do I salvage this?**



This is long and ridiculous. Sorry. My (30f) husband, Luke (33m), had a sister, Laura (29f). We were all close and saw each other 2-3 times a month, along with their parents. Almost 6 months ago, Laura fell down the stairs at their family home and died. It was a freak accident, there's a window on the half landing and she hit her head on the sill.

I was the last person to see her. I was there for less than 10 minutes and she was in her pyjamas making coffee. I didn't even stay for a drink, and I struggle with how such a brief and meaningless interaction could have been her last. She deserved so much more.

My husband and I have only been married for a year but we've been together for 4 and have known each other for 20+. When Laura's parents found her they called my husband straight away and we rushed over. We faced the whole thing as a family. In the days after, Luke started quizzing me. Exactly what we talked about, what she was wearing, where we were standing etc.

It progressed to saying I was providing conflicting information (on tiny details he was deliberately misunderstanding) and accusing me of withholding information because I couldn't tell him things like what pyjamas she was wearing. This escalated quickly but lasted for less than a week, as I lost my cool and made it clear that I was done answering questions. He didn't bring it up again and I wrote it off as a grief quirk. His behaviour was generally that of a normal, grieving person.

Last Friday, he outright accused me of murdering her, in front of his parents. Out of the blue. We were all stunned. There was an inquest which recently concluded, and there was never any doubt the verdict would be accidental death. He said it was completely obvious and he couldn't believe that no one else could see it. He claims I went through his phone and found his messages with Laura (I have absolutely no idea what messages he's talking about, I have never looked at his phone) and that I went over to confront her and things ""got out of hand"" and I pushed her downstairs.

By the end he was shouting about going to the police and getting the inquest overturned, and how I wasn't going to get away with it. Let me be clear - Laura and I had a great relationship. We all did. I have no idea where this has come from, other than these messages I haven't seen, and even then, I don't think there's anything I could ever see on someone's phone that would drive me to murder. It's just ridiculous.

He's been with his parents since this happened and will not talk to me at all. I've had some contact with his mum but she's not being very communicative. The last I heard, she didn't know what messages he was referring to either.

I am still completely stunned and I have no idea how to proceed. I made a commitment to be there for him always, and I understand that grief can manifest in strange ways, but part of me feels like my love for him died the second he called me a murderer and I don't know how we could possibly work through this. I also really don't want to be thought of in this way and I have no idea if he has said anything to people we know. I obviously haven't.

A brain tumour or psychotic break has crossed my mind and I suggested it to his mother, and she just said she'll talk to him. Other than the questions before, he hasn't been acting odd. Obviously he's been grieving, but he's seemed sane and sensible other than this. I feel like I'm going mad, does anyone have any advice at all?

Tl;Dr - My husband's sister died in a horrible accident, and my husband, for absolutely no reason other than some mystery messages, thinks I murdered her.

Edit: it has come to my attention that I accidentally used ""Laura's"" real name once in this post. Can I kindly ask that anyone who commented ""Who is (realname)?"" delete their comment as I really don't want this to bleed into my real life. For obvious reasons.



**Comments**



**Morall\_tach**

*Fuck no. You don't salvage this, you get a lawyer and get the fuck out. Best case scenario, he has just admitted to sending messages with his sister that he thinks would make you angry enough to kill her over them. I have some ideas about what those might be and they're all bad. How did the parents react when he did this?*



**Gladtobealive2020**

*And it his guilt/ fear of discovery of whatever is in those messages that is causing him to make these accusation, using anger as a defense mechanism.*



**HelloJunebug**

*What do you think the messages entailed?*



**destiny\_kane48**

*Incest?? IDK, I can't think of a single other thing it could be. The two of them insulting her wouldn't be enough. Honestly, them being incestuous kinda explains everything.*



**4Bforever**

*Initially I was thinking he was having an affair and his sister was helping him. But wouldn’t he then expect her to kill him and not the sister*



**Electronic\_Lock325**

*Well, OP said they were really close. Maybe he thinks she got angry at the sister for not telling her?*



**WonderfulPrior381**

*You need to get a lawyer to protect yourself in case he does go to the police. I would write down everything that you can remember that happened that day and keep it just in case. He may be having a psychotic break. As stated don’t talk to him or his immediate family or your friends without someone present or preferably by text or email. Save everything. You need to take his accusations seriously and cover your ass.*

>OOP: I was interviewed by the coroner's office after her death as I was the last person to see her. She died about 3 hours after I saw her, and I'd been to the supermarket and was home by that point. It's all verifiable and was a recorded interview.



**Grolschisgood**

*I think they mean record everything you remember about the day your soon to be ex accused you of murder.*

>OOP: I'm feeling so freaked out at the idea that he came up with this almost immediately after her death, and has either been sitting on it or planning his confrontation, that I'm basically trying to dissect the past 6 months.

**Can I force my husband to get a mental health assessment, and do I risk being arrested/prosecuted? We're in England - 1 day later**



I'm in a bizarre and complex situation with my husband. I have broken the law, and I feel I have no choice but to do so again for my safety. I don't know what type of solicitor I need or what the next steps should look like. We're in England, and I'll try not to editorialise too much.

My husband's sister died suddenly at the start of the year. Her death was an accident and there was no suggestion to the contrary. The inquest was recently concluded and a verdict of accidental death returned. I was the last person to see her, but her time of death, which was almost immediate due to her injury, was confirmed to be hours after I had left the house. All of this was verified at the time.

In the immediate aftermath, my husband behaved strangely and kept trying to trip up my story of the last time we saw each other, which was a brief interaction. Last week (months after this was first and last mentioned) he outright accused me of murder, in front of his parents. He says I saw his messages with his sister and confronted her, and that he's going to have the coroner decision overturned and have the police investigate. I haven't seen or heard from him since (today is day 9).

I posted for advice on reddit (I'm pretty desperate at this point) and it has spooked me, quite reasonably I think, but also led to me committing a crime and planning another.

My husband's icloud credentials were saved on an old iPad in his office, and I downloaded his backup last night. I have read all of his messages with his sister, and there is absolutely nothing like he describes. I understand this is illegal and I'm concerned about the possible ramifications. I am also waiting for a callback from a locksmith to change the locks on the home we own together, which I believe is also against the law.

So this leads to my actual questions:

I feel justified in what I've done for my safety, but is there a degree of pragmatism under the law for these issues because of the situation, or am I shooting myself in the foot?

I am resigned to the fact my relationship is over, but his parents don't seem to be taking this seriously and they're icing me out. I believe this is a serious mental health issue which may put people, namely me, at risk. Can I do anything about this when all I have is the fact I'm being accused of murder? I feel he needs to be detained and this should be investigated as a full blown psychotic break.

Sorry this is all a bit mental. In addition, what type of solicitor do I need? My understanding is that a coroner decision can't be appealed, is that correct? Are his accusations going to go anywhere? Can I protect myself from this or stop him escalating to telling others? We live in our hometown and everyone knows everyone, this could follow me forever and it's either a lie or a delusion. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

*You are jumping ahead of yourself and playing out situations that have not occurred*

*If your husband reports you to the police for accessing his data and you are subsequently arrested or taken in for questioning then obtain the services of a criminal solicitor for advice*

*With respect of changing locks/ending your marriage, seek a solicitor that deals with family law/divorce*

*If you feel that you are at risk from your husband talk to a domestic abuse helpline, if you feel you are at an immediate risk of harm then call the police*

*If you think your husband is mentally ill and presents a risk to himself or others call the police*

>OOP: What else can I do? He has blocked me everywhere, and we went from a normal couple dealing with the new normal 6 months after the death of his sister, to me being accused of murder over a family dinner because of messages which clearly don't exist, and it's been 9 days and I've heard nothing since.



**FloorPerson\_95**

*No-Firefighter-9257 is giving good advice here. OP you need to separate things out in your mind. Your only possible crime is accessing his backup. That would go through a process if it is reported and followed up on. The fact that your husband thinks you have committed murder is totally separate to this. Ultimately if your husband accuses you of murder then that goes through a process. This has not started. Your current questions seem to be (1) about mental health of your husband and (2) about changing locks*



**Dry\_Action1734**

*Changing the locks on your own house is not a crime. But he could then just have them changed again. So it may not be the most useful thing to do. Bit of an expensive back and forth. But maybe do as he’s been gone for a while, so he may not come back.*

*As for the icloud issue. Yes, it’s an offence under the Computer Misuse Act. Given the circumstances, it sounds extremely unlikely you’d be prosecuted. You did it to determine the extent of a health issue with a loved one to help you help them, so a prosecution is unlikely to be in the public interest as you described it. Just don’t take it any further and your divorce lawyer can advise whether it can be used in proceedings.*

*You can’t force a mental health check just because. As for being detained, I’m not too sure of the process, but afaik the police would need to see a real risk of danger to himself or someone else, not just taking your word for it. A mental health issue definitely doesn’t require detention just because it’s mental health related. Just contact the police, explain everything (maybe leave out icloud stuff for now), and express concern for your safety.*



**Ambry**

*I agree. Ultimately I hear of very, very few cases of partner related snooping that ever gets reported as a crime and OPs husband also has no reason to know about this unless he reports OP for murder and OP needs to use the evidence as a defence.*



**Update - 7 days later**



Firstly, thank you to those who helped me get to my husband's icloud backups through an old iPad. I wasn't expecting much from reddit, but I got valuable practical advice before my post was locked, and I appreciate it.

There were no crazy, or even suspicious messages. I've searched for over 100 terms and scrolled back over years. I saw a side of them both I wasn't expecting, but nothing that explains the claim I murdered Laura over their chats. Nothing to suggest he was cheating. Absolutely nothing to suggest incest. I repeat: NO INCEST. No weird gaps where deleted conversations or a switch to another app would fit. Just siblings making plans, sending memes, and gossiping. They said unexpectedly horrible stuff about a few people, but not me. It was a sort of relief but it raised more questions than it answered.

I sought legal advice, also from reddit, after posting here. Turns out my options are divorce him or sit down. I contacted my community mental health team, who said they'd reach out, but made it clear it wasn't urgent. I then called his mum and said that if I didn't hear from him by this weekend, I would get a solicitor and ask for a mental heath assessment as part of the divorce. In response, he made a ridiculous post to Facebook (which neither of us have used in years) and everything blew up. I'm going to try to keep this succinct.

On Friday night, he made a long accusation on Facebook, with new information. He said he'd been planning to leave me for months with his sister's support, and I found the messages, and murdered her. The coroner has reopened the case and the police are preparing to arrest me, and he needs to make sure people know before the trial stops him talking about it. It was well written and seemed vaguely plausable.

He messaged people links so it got some attention - we live in our hometown, and have a large circle of friends because we've been here all our lives. People I haven't spoken to since school were reaching out to me asking wtf was going on. It was madness.

In response, I posted the export of his entire conversation history with Laura, also to Facebook (when I finally got back in). I linked to the chat along with a post explaining my side, and noting that I had changed my ex's icloud and apple passwords, and that if he wanted them back, he should comment on my post and update his own, admitting that he was lying. He eventually did.

When I started getting messages about his post, I panicked, and changing his passwords seemed important to preserve everything because he'd know I had access. When I spoke to him the next morning it's clear he's not having a mental episode at all, but is claiming one because he's been caught in a big lie. As soon as he was outed, he called me, clearly drunk, begging and promising to explain everything if I deleted my post. I hung up and told him to call back the next day. He did (after many missed calls and texts), and he tried to bargain and guilt trip me with his mental health until it was clear the wrong people had seen his conversation. It's hard to describe but it seemed fake. It was too well rehearsed, and then this morning, when it was clear he was getting nowhere, he blocked me.

Begging for mercy and reciting facts about mental disorders doesn't align with someone in crisis with a sincere belief that someone murdered their sibling. The question of why he did all this remains unanswered, and he will not be getting his passwords until it is. The legal advice subreddit said this stuff is technically illegal but it's beneath a court to take action, so I'm going to count on that because I felt like I had no other choice at the time, and now I don't see any other way to get answers from him. I am desperate and it's all I've got.

So there we are. The relationship I have believed was my destiny since I was a teenager has boiled down to petty, convoluted and vindictive bullshit, played out on social media, for reasons still unknown. My hope for a brain tumour is fading and clearly tomorrow morning is going to be when I lawyer up and stop posting about this. I am mortified, I have no idea whether some people might believe him, and I still don't know why this all happened in the first place. Sorry I don't have a happier update, and thanks once again to everyone who offered advice.



**Comments**



**Even\_Budget2078**

*Wow, OP. I am so sorry. This is not the update I expected because it's even more bizarre. Can you provide more info on how people reacted and why he confessed to lying (without explaining why)? It was obvious his post was fake is that it? If he wanted a divorce, this is the dumbest way ever to go about it, I just can't understand his thinking at all. Again, I'm so sorry, what a nightmare for you.*

>OOP: He didn't react at all. He'd called me tens of times at that point and we'd had 5 conversations on the phone about it. He was laser focussed on me deleting the chat log from the get go, but when I made it clear that posting that comment and editing his original Facebook post was the only way to progress the conversation at all, he finally did it. Then he went silent publicly as far as I can see, but continued begging me behind the scenes.



**henicorina**

*What on earth is in those chats that he’s so desperate to keep people from seeing, and that would conceivably lead you to kill someone? Is there any chance they were using some kind of code or something?*

>OOP: I think it was the fact that it proved his story false, alongside the way they spoke about some people. It was really damaging stuff and I can see why he panicked, I hated to do it to him but I really couldn't think of anything else because so many people had questions.



**mckinnos**

*…um. Maybe I just read too many murder mystery novels, but does he have a good alibi for his sister’s death…????*



**scrappy8350**

*This. This crossed my mind first. Why is he so adamant on blaming his wife like he has to find a perpetrator to divert suspicion away himself?*



**twilightpigeon**

*The case had been ruled an accident by the medical examiner. So if he did do it it would be so dumb to reopen the case. Although he doesn't sound like he's the sharpest.*

**Update - 6 days later**

&#x200B;

As this was removed from relationship advice: Hi everyone. Me again. Both times I've posted here it has paid off hugely in terms of helping unravel this mess, so I hope it's third time lucky. For the past few weeks I've been trying to figure out why my husband suddenly accused me of murdering his sister, who died in an accident at home, 6 months ago. It still feels as ridiculous now as it did then. When Laura died we found out she had about £3k in hidden debt. It was odd because she was pretty open about her finances, but it wasn't out of character for her to overspend so I hadn't really thought about it since. A comment on my last post prompted me to look more closely at money stuff, and a message to my husband from Laura asking about a payment stuck out. I'd initially assumed it was about a car issue she'd had a few weeks before she died, but Luke definitely paid at the garage when they picked it up, because we talked about it after she dropped him home. It didn't occur to me when I first looked through. The messages supposedly proved I was a murderer so I had been looking for something scandalous. The message about payment was the only thing I had at that point, and I had no idea what it meant, so I took a chance. I told his mother I knew about the money, and that if he didn't get in touch with me that day, I would make sure everybody else did too. He called me straight away and asked me over to his parents' house to talk. He looked dreadful, and the first thing he asked me was whether I was happy now all of his friends hate him. I told him I don't give a fuck about his relationships and that I was there for answers. It turns my husband told the coroner's office that he was secretly helping Laura pay some of her debt because she was embarrassed and struggling to keep up with her lifestyle. I assume it didn't seem suspicious because her death was clearly an accident, and that's what they were investigating. In reality he took out loans and storecards in her name, and she somehow found out a few weeks before she died. Some guy he works with had apparently done it before and arranged it all, and if Laura hadn't found out, he claims they could have had it written off without her ever knowing. When she did find out, the guy left him high and dry (quelle surprise), and he had to pay it off. I'm inclined to believe that's the gist of what happened, but I am shocked my husband would do something this stupid. When she died so soon after, his brief and apparently genuine suspicion was that she had told me about it that day, and we argued and I'd killed her. He couldn't explain why I would kill someone because they were a victim of fraud, but according to him, he felt guilty in the immediate aftermath and his brain made it fit. I mostly believe this, but he tried launching into more weaponised therapy speak at that point, so I cut the topic off. A few months after his sister's death, Luke received a letter from a credit company (not even the police) saying he was being investigated. Laura didn't have much, so her debts (which were less than £10k even with the fraud) were mostly written off. Something obviously flagged against my husband during that process, I don't know how or why. When the letters got more threatening, he believed the investigation would reopen the inquest, and that he would be accused of fraud, perjury, and because of his previously unknown motive, possibly murder. He claims the only thing the company investigating him actually knows is that the fraud came from our address, so accusing me would make it impossible to prove because it would be a coin toss (his words) as to which one of us took out the credit in Laura's name. That was worth our entire marriage to him, and my reputation in the community we have been part of for our entire lives. He says self preservation kicked in and nothing else mattered when he thought about what could happen to him. When I asked him how his witness statement fits into his plan, because it proved he lied either way by acknowledging he knew about the debt and paying it, he froze for roughly a million years before saying he hadn't thought of that. Obviously my response was to ask why, if he hadn't thought of it, he specifically said it was a lie he needed to cover earlier in the conversation. Suddenly he's sobbing and his parents are rushing in to ask me to leave. I was in tears at this point asking how the fuck he could do this to me over something so stupid, and how much his parents knew about this (as his mum was pushing me out of their house). All she said was that she couldn't have this conversation with me. She was crying too but wouldn't say another word. I am now 99% sure the fucker was trying to frame me. Not for her death, but for the fraud. He was going to claim that he was lying for me in the coroner's interview right? If he wrapped it all up as quietly paying her off on my behalf then genuinely suspecting me of her murder, it would protect his reputation and point the finger at me. It just doesn't make sense any other way. Is my husband trying to frame me to weasel out of his actions, and how do I get to the bottom of this? I'm obviously open to theories because reddit is the only reason I got this far in the first place. That being said, please don't come up with conspiracies about Laura's death in the comments. It's upsetting. She was wearing shitty old slippers and walking upstairs with a cup of tea, and she slipped and hit her head on a windowsill. This was never a murder mystery, it was someone's life, and she died just because. Maybe a butterfly flapped its wings somewhere, I don't know, but it's hard enough to accept without having guesses shouted at me on the internet whilst my marriage falls apart.

Hey folks — thought I’d share how my first month trying out beermoney went (since there are so many “scam” posts, maybe this helps someone). I signed up on 2–3 sites aimed at NZ users, filled out all my profile details carefully to get matched. In total I did about 5–6 surveys a week — nothing crazy, maybe 20–30 mins per evening.

By the end of the month I got ~NZ$25-30 in gift-cards / vouchers — it’s not a lot, but for a few cups of coffee extra or small buys, it helps. It was a bit hit-and-miss (some weeks there were almost no survey invites). I’m treating it as “fun money,” not a job.

If other NZ folks are trying this — set realistic expectations, spread across 2–3 sites (so you don’t rely on one), and only do it for spare time",1,1765345614.0,BeermoneyNZ,1,1.0,False

Still trying to put fine touches on The Chairman's confrontation. It's gonna take a little bit. I've had comments and a couple of DMs of appreciation though, and I'm enjoying the writing.

======================================================  
**The automated carriage was not the most comfortable means of travelling, after some adjustment to the strange motion Karl found the speed exhilirating. Fred was clearly fascinated by the engineering involved, his eyes following the pilots management of various levers and switches with intense interest.**

**Karl was entirely pre-occupied with the human machinery at work beyond the vehicles' hull. As the fields rushed by, he could barely glimpse a worker for a moment, but as each paddy passed he saw that each matched a pattern. The labour carried on about them was in a clumsy unison. It's form was not mandated by any foreman he could determine, nor did the machines of their trade demand a certain pace, for machinery of any sort seemed scarce. The farm workers kept the rhythm of their labour by some other means.**

**Words left his mouth on a breath, barely audible.**

**MARX:** That's not in the book...

**ENGELS:** How do you suppose it works?

**Karl's head turned suddenly, Commander Luhai clutched his rifle in response to the sudden motion. He relaxed quickly but continued scanning both men from the passenger seat. Karl had barely heard himself, had Fred shared his thoughts so fluently?**

**MARX:** I'm sure there's an explanation in our theory somewhere, Fred.

**ENGELS:** Forgive me Karl, we are both clever men, but I doubt it. As an engineer myself, I can see how the large wheel steers the craft as a ship's rudder would. But the levers and pedals are **all** involved in the control of our speed, it's a bewildering labyrinth of function.

**MARX:** Ah, I see. Well, it certainly goes to show that an industrial base exists somewhere in Chinese society, doesn't it! No doubt there are sophisticated technical minds at this headquarters that might explain it to you. This Chairman I'm sure will have some experience of engineering!

**ENGELS:** I hope we will be able to see how it is constructed. Do you think they have socket wrenches yet?

**KARL:** Perhaps, we shall have to ask. Let's continue our observations for now.

**As Karl looked beyond the carriages threshold once more the rice fields gave way to a brief stretch of pasture, then an abrupt shudder gave out as the carriage crossed a sturdy wooden bridge after which the carriage slowed gently and came to a stop. Karl caught a glimpse of people washing sheets in the river when a uniformed figure intercepted his view.**

**SENTRY:** So it is true. Imperialist spies, and so close to our heartland.

**KARL:** We are not spies of any kind. We are scholars, and scientists.

**SENTRY:** It will become clear in time.

**COMMANDER LUHAI:** It is not for us to judge, comrade. I am to take them straight to the Chairman's Dining Room.

**SENTRY:** Ha, of course, Commander. Am I also invited?

**COMMANDER LUHAI:** Open the barrier, immediately.

**The sentry's realisation was immediate.**

**SENTRY:** Yes, sir. Forgive me.

**The carriage passed through the small settlement slowly, a brisk walk would have met it's pace. A trio of young children stared in awe at the two men in the back as they passed, the youngest of them gesturing to the elders and pulling at their sleeves.**

**A turn in the road was followed by another sentry post, which seemed to have been cleared in advance. Beyond, set upon a man made hill was the only building they had seen that boasted more than a single story; and the population of servicemen alone seemed to equal that of the village. As the carriage drew up to the steps that lead within, Karl glimpsed a stout figure on a balcony extending from the turret like structure to his right. The sunlight obscured details, and before Karl could raise his arms to shade his eyes, the figure tossed something, a cigarette perhaps, and retreated within.**

**Both militiamen left the vehicle to entreat the forward sentries.**

**ENGELS:** This Chairman runs a tight ship, it would seem. I would not say that all these men are equal, would you Karl?

**MARX:** Indeed, Fred. Though they are clearly organised, and united in purpose. But is this *truly* a revolutionary headquarters?

**ENGELS:** What gives you pause?

**MARX:** These are fighting men, but surely not an army. If this is the capital of the revolution, surely it would be better guarded? No cavalry or cannon can be seen.

**ENGELS:** Just because we can not see them, does not mean they are not there. You haven't gotten around to explaining how a revolution should be carried out yet, have you?

**MARX:** No. It's not in the book...

**The carriage door to Marx's left swung open.**

**COMMISSAR SU:** Welcome gentlemen. I am Commissar Su, Director of Communications. Please alight the vehicle and come with me.

**The melodic tones of femininity had left Karl and Fred stunned for a moment. As they turned toward the source they saw an immaculately uniformed figure no more than 4 feet and 10 inches tall. She looked no older than thirty.**

**COMMISSAR SU:** The Chairman will not have a meal served to this motor car, Doctors. Please come along.

**MARX:** Yes, of course madame we-

**COMMISSAR SU:** You may address me as Comrade Su or Commissar Su. Please do as I have instructed.

**Karl shuffled haphazardly as he raised his legs over the berth of the doorway and set his feet upon the tiles below. He rose to his feet and stepped aside as Fred followed suit.**

**COMMISSAR SU:** Ah, that won't do. Comrade Luhai, please remove our guests restraints.

**The Commander moved immediately to unfasten the cuffs around Karl and Fred's wrists. His deference to the diminutive figure was not lost on Karl.**

**COMMISSAR SU:** Thank you Comrade Commander, you may return to your assigned duties. Doctors, let us proceed.

**MARX:** Lead and we shall follow, Commissar.

**Her smile was curt, but sincere. Her pace was uncanny for a woman of her height, the two stout elders pounded a march into the building and across a foyer. As the trio advanced down a long corridor Commissar Su was met with salutes by each and every other occupant of the compound.** **With only 4 metres or so of the corridor remaining, she stopped at a door to their right, Karl tried not to seem short for breath. He failed.**

**COMMISSAR SU:** The Chairman is most looking forward to speaking with you, Doctors. If I may say so, I have not seen him so eager for a meeting in some time. First you will enjoy tea, as is Chinese custom, then dinner will be served.

**MARX**: May I..

**COMMISSAR SU:** I will answer your questions shortly, Doctor Marx. You are ""invited"" to use these washrooms to make yourselves ready. You must make do with the time you have, but I would advise you to bring as little Shaanxi hillside into the dining room as possible. The Chairman values hygiene and decorum in equal measure. He also prefers not to be kept waiting. Do not worry about making a mess, I will see that the facilities are cleaned after use What was your question Doctor Marx?

**MARX:** May I have some matches. I would very much like to smoke a cigar.

**COMMISSAR SU:** I do not doubt that The Chairman will gladly offer you a match. All the better to hurry along, yes?

**MARX:** I can't argue with that.

**The washroom was not luxurious, but it did have hot running water, in a rural community such as this that was quite remarkable. It seemed unlikely to Fred or Karl that this was something the villagers had been afforded. Fred had already begun cleaning his hands in one of three basins**

**ENGELS:** A remarkable young woman that commissar, don't you think.

**MARX:** Indeed, she seems to have no trouble taking charge. Do you think there are many like her here?

**ENGELS:** It would be a socialist principle to make it possible, wouldn't it?

**MARX:** I feel it would have to be, yes. There is a powerful class consciousness among these people, but not the sort I imagined. There is a troublingly strict hierarchy, but not through exploitation. The chain of command is bound by...

**ENGELS:** Purpose? Hope?

**MARX:** Hope? Idealism, totally inadequate. But more fundamental than cause or purpose. Solidarity, as a matter of principle, I think that is what I sense.

**The soap available bore no scent, but it was of good quality and lathered well. A set of brushes scraped the worst of the dirt from their shoes, but their jackets would need a thorough cleaning to be dinner worthy. Regardless, they had done their best, and Commissar Su's knuckles had struck the door.**

**Fred and Karl observed themselves in the mirrors mounted to the walls before they stepped back into the corridor. The Commissar assessed them both.**

**COMMISSAR SU**: Not optimal, but acceptable. Under the circumstances I am sure The Chairman will understand. This way, please.

**The Commissar opened both of the dual doors at the hallways end.**

**COMMISSAR SU:** Comrade Chairman, your guests have arrived.

**The voice that came from the far end of the hall was unique; a graceful instrument of instruction and command, it was as though each syllable had been chosen in ancient times for the moment then at hand.**

**THE CHAIRMAN:** As always, Comrade Director, your timing is perfect. Please show the Doctors to the lounge seating. The tea will be ready in 84 seconds.

**The Commissar wordlessly ushered the two men through the doors, gestured them to remove their jackets and took them to a nearby coat stand.**

**The room was large and well furnished, though by no means ostentatiously so. To call it a dining room was hardly the full picture, the seating they were guided to was plain to the eye but cosy and well kept, the table in the center was set for 3 and the closest corner housed a small library, shelved from floor to ceiling, 4 paces from the wall a writing desk of solid wood. Atop the desk was what appeared to be a writing machine that Karl had seen prototype drawings of back home.**

**THE CHAIRMAN:** There is a matchbook on the coffee table for you, Doctor Marx. Please take them all, my kerosene lighter serves me for cigarettes. The machine you are looking at is indeed a writing machine, of German production no less. In this era, the common name for the device is a typewriter.

**Karl looked toward the figure in the dimly lit reaches of the chamber, his back still turned on them. He reached for the matches and took his cigar from his pocket.**

**THE CHAIRMAN:** Comrade Su, I would prefer my guests and I are not disturbed for the remainder of the evening. Is there anything you require me to arrange before I stand relieved?

1piur4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dream/comments/1piur4q/multiple_dreams_about_girls_what_do_they_all_mean/,Multiple dreams about girls. What do they all mean?,"The first one was a while back after a party during which I hugged my former classmate [17f] (I [17m] couldn't believe it when my friends told me since im not attractive and she was the queen of our school). We barely talked in school but on the party we were talking and the last words of hers I remember were either 'I thought' or 'I was thinking' (both are told the same in my language)

The first one, I had to take of the shoes and but them in a bag before going into a store. Then when i came back i saw that the bag had another pair. Then this girl comes, tells me something i dont remember, i take out the shoes for her, she thanks me and we share our goodbyes, but it turned out we were going the same way and talks something. Next thing that happens, we're playing csgo together on Cache (i loved the map and still miss it)

Next one i faintly remember:
I was going somewhere, and passed a goth girl in a doorway (I'm not into goth). We looked back at eachother. Next thing I remember is I go talk to her and keep stuttering but we went and grabbed a coffee together 

The last one was tonight:
I was in a classroom with my best friend talking about some fuel station guy that did something (possibly PDF-file). Then the bell rings and he goes somewhere and I go sit next to the classroom. Then there's this girl that comes up to me (she's real and I'm not attracted to her irl) and says I look cute right off the bat. I'm shocked, don't know what to say. Then she says 'lets go for a walk' and i say 'sure'. We start walking and we walk in two different directions. When I notice, I quickly go back to her. Next thing I remember we are in some kind of kitchen, there's me, her and the friend from earlier. I'm pouring tea for everyone. There's exactly 7L left after I do. And me and my friend come back to talking about the fuel station guy.



Now, do these dreams have anything in common? I don't know what to think about them. What are they trying to say to me?",1,1765345481.0,Dream,0,1.0,False
1piur29,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1piur29/aita_for_wanting_no_contact_with_my_pregnant/,AITA for wanting no contact with my pregnant sister Part 2,"First Post, Part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/s/AY1EC6Xr4f

Pt 2. 

It felt like every time I was bonding with one of my sisters, Katie would come in and, what felt to me, was bribing them away from me. Stuff like, “Hey, do you wanna go get coffee?” or “Do you wanna go shopping with me?” Things kids are gonna say yes to. And it was always just one child at a time, and it was always a child I was hanging out with.

Another thing I noticed was that I talked about wanting to do multiple things, like trips that required a passport, events, or visiting new places. Katie would hear about these plans, whether I told her directly or she overheard. Then, within a week or less, she’d say stuff like, “Me and Emma are planning a go to that place,” and it’d be the exact place I wanted to go. I never really said anything about it; I’d just give helpful info like, “Did you know there’s one closer to us?” and that was it.

I feel like we need a bit of backstory here, but I’ll keep it short and simple. We have a cousin, Ashley (F19), who’s involved in this. Katie’s first love was really hard on her. After they broke up, that ex-boyfriend started dating Ashley. Katie actually caught him cheating on her with Ashley multiple times. Once Katie and that boy broke up, he and Ashley had a full-on relationship. 

This happened again when Katie broke up with another boyfriend this year. Ashley is currently with one of Katie’s exes for the second time. Katie was really upset about it, and I’ve always been there to support her through it. She’s wanted to do some pretty crazy, irrational things, but I’ve talked her out of it because it’s not worth the battle. 

I felt bad for her because I couldn’t imagine someone doing that to me, so I tried my best to support her through it, and I pretty much still do. Actually, Ashley kind of stopped talking to us and coming around. I think her guilty conscience weighs on her, and she just didn’t want to face the issue. Katie’s mom would definitely say something about it, so Ashley knew to keep her distance. 

So yeah, Katie has definitely been a victim of a family member dating her ex, twice, and I feel like Katie would never do that to someone because she knows exactly how it feels, how much it hurts, and how wrong it is to do that to someone you love and consider family.

So I found out that Katie is seeing James, and I had already made up my mind to do minimum contact with her because of it. The only time I’d talk to her would be about family stuff or the sisters. I wasn’t going to have normal conversations or be friends with her beyond that. I knew it was going to be hard for me to stick around, but at least I planned to keep minimum contact until they break up and James is out of the picture.

I kind of had this game plan, but it’s been really hard. There have been a lot of weird situations where I feel like I’m almost forced to confront it, but I still haven’t. I don’t want to fight because when we do, the whole family gets involved and it gets twisted. Somehow, I always end up being the bad guy, I’m too sensitive, making a fuss, and/or causing fights for no reason. I’m so tired of being in that position and being belittled, so it’s just not worth it. I’ll distance myself and avoid drama or arguments. I don’t want to argue or fight with her, but my feelings are definitely hurt. I feel a deep sense of betrayal, and it really upsets me.

The hard truth is, she never talked to me about it or asked how I feel, and she’s never admitted they’re together. Then Katie told me about another incident with James and Emma. Apparently, one night they were all drinking, and Emma and James slept together again. I remember telling Katie, “It’s so obvious they’re in love with each other, why won’t they just be together?” And she just got silent after that because Katie and James are technically dating now, whether they say it or not.

So today I find out from her and our shared sister that Katie is now pregnant with his (James’s) baby. She didn’t say it was him, but it’s definitely is. She spends almost every night at his house and is around him a lot, and he’s the only guy she’s seeing, (or at least I hope). So I can put two and two together and know she’s pregnant with his baby. She still hasn’t told me directly, but that’s okay. I don’t want to talk to her about it anyway. She’s very much against abortion so the baby will be coming. She said she’d know the gender by the end of the month, so I assume she’s about nine weeks along.

I don’t want anything to do with this. I don’t even want to be an aunt. I don’t want to talk to her or be around her. I don’t want to be around our shared sister either because it’s going to remind me and it feels like it’s being rubbed in my face. That’s just how I feel. And I don’t want to feel any of this. But I want us to be close. I don’t want to fight, I want a good relationship, but with all this, it feels impossible now. I love Katie and don’t want to stop talking to her, but I feel like I’ve reached a point where, for my own peace, I need to distance myself from her for now and see how I feel later in life.

But I really don’t want to. Obviously, there will have to be some kind of interaction unless I want to miss out on holidays, birthdays, and big events -and that’s not going to happen. I’ll have to see her at some point.

Today she brought this up this news and said we should hang out. Now, I really don’t know what to do She wants me to help her with her pregnancy, support her, and give her advice. I feel like I’m being put in a position where I either have to accept this situation or lose my relationship with my sister and I don’t want either of those things. So, would I be the asshole if I decided not to talk to her anymore? Or what do I do?

1piuoah,https://www.reddit.com/r/neurodiversity/comments/1piuoah/me/,Me,"I’m a 20y/o M college student, who has struggled with motivation my entire life. 

Mom & Dad have ADHD/Depression

Dad likely has anxiety— always worrying about the world (war, economy, etc.) however he’s a risk analyst so I suppose he has an excuse. 

Oldest brother has ADHD

Second oldest was born with failure to thrive. He has a lot of severe issues that basically make him do nothing with his life despite tons of support from family. Without his girlfriend who is also severely struggling he’d be completely homeless— no job, nothing. 

Third and last has diagnosed bipolar 2, having manic episodes about once every two months. He has diagnosed anxiety, adhd, depression, and autism.


In first grade I was diagnosed with ADHD. I was a good learner and social, but I was very hyperactive and my teachers discussed with my mom that it may be an issue…

I was put on Adderall, which killed all my creativity (drawing, coloring, building, etc.) and stopped my appetite almost entirely. My mom took me off of it and I never went back on anything my entire childhood all the way through high school.

In second grade, according to testing done at school I was reading at a college reading level, or according to the test “12.9+” meaning twelfth year of school, and beyond 9 months. My teacher had a conference with my mom and started crying real tears. She told her she didn’t know what to do with me. She said I sat in class reading books and when she would cold call me to see if I was paying attention I always knew the answer. She suggested we find some kind of alternative so that I wouldn’t just be sitting in class, or to bump me up a grade. They decided I could “run errands” which basically just meant I did small tasks during class to keep me busy. 

Flash forward to fifth grade. I was still an excellent reader and learner, but now we were charged with picking out books, and keeping log of how many chapters we read and ultimately finishing the book. I would pick books in the school library to check out, put them down at home and never touch them. I’d find my own books and read them instead even though my teacher said it should be a book from the library from a specific section. I didn’t care. This was my first real instance of feeling like I couldn’t be forced to do something I didn’t want to do. I had no kind of external motivation pushing me towards achieving a goal coming from the people around me/society.

Middle school I largely goofed off with my friends. I would finish my work in class early so that I could roam the halls and do what I wanted to do. I was still in “AIG” classes and was performing well, but I didn’t act like it. Anyways, it was middle school. 

High school came and covid hit. I went out and my grandmother had a stroke completely disabling her. I started caring for her and helping her rehabilitate. By my junior year I had decided to try and go back to school, so I enrolled. I lasted all of one month, maybe even less before I decided I couldn’t take it. I legitimately felt like I was imprisoned, with condescending wardens that controlled my every move. I transitioned to online learning and graduated with honors and about a semester worth of college credits. 

Flash forward to college. Despite my intelligence and knowing I CAN complete work on my own, and do it well, I have relied on cheating and AI for many courses where I could get away with because I simply could not convince myself to do the work. I sit at home, scroll on social media, watch pornography/masturbate, suppressed anxious feelings about the school work that’s not getting done, all until my s/o comes home and I try to go back to acting normal. I also feel pretty “normal” when I’m with my friends but I go right back to not wanting to do anything as soon as they’re gone or I’m by myself. 

I don’t know what I want to do with my future despite pretty much being done with my degree and minors, and having explored other subjects. I can’t even imagine what I want to do with my life— it’s almost just…nothing

I’ve always wanted more for myself and to do good and even great things, but the motivation just absolutely is not there. I can’t see a future with my girlfriend anymore despite the healthiness of our relationship. 

I started seeing a psychiatrist a few months ago and started on 300mg of Wellbutrin. Nothing happened. She added on the lowest dose of qelbree, also nothing however both have completely dried me out. I quit taking the qelbree and stopped the Wellbutrin today. 

I’m graduating in the summer and I’m not quite sure what to do to get my life on track. To start feeling motivated, and to have aspirations that make sense. 

I have tons of hobbies. I grind and brew fresh coffee using the pour over method every morning. I play piano and guitar (and collect a few too many guitars for someone my age) I do jiu jitsu, travel frequently, do photography professionally, and more. Yet, nothing seems to satisfy me. I can’t land on something that feels “right.” I can’t just open a coffee shop, or become a jiu jitsu black belt and open a school, or become a music teacher, or use my degree for what it’s intended for. I just have no desire nor motivation to do any of it. I’m interested but simultaneously feel unfulfilled by these things. I constantly crave more but can never get it. 

I’m not really sure what I should do, or what I can do. But I’d sure like to figure it out soon.

Still trying to put fine touches on The Chairman's confrontation. It's gonna take a little bit. I've had comments and a couple of DMs of appreciation though, and I'm enjoying the writing.

======================================================  
**The automated carriage was not the most comfortable means of travelling, after some adjustment to the strange motion Karl found the speed exhilirating. Fred was clearly fascinated by the engineering involved, his eyes following the pilots management of various levers and switches with intense interest.**

**Karl was entirely pre-occupied with the human machinery at work beyond the vehicles' hull. As the fields rushed by, he could barely glimpse a worker for a moment, but as each paddy passed he saw that each matched a pattern. The labour carried on about them was in a clumsy unison. It's form was not mandated by any foreman he could determine, nor did the machines of their trade demand a certain pace, for machinery of any sort seemed scarce. The farm workers kept the rhythm of their labour by some other means.**

**Words left his mouth on a breath, barely audible.**

**MARX:** That's not in the book...

**ENGELS:** How do you suppose it works?

**Karl's head turned suddenly, Commander Luhai clutched his rifle in response to the sudden motion. He relaxed quickly but continued scanning both men from the passenger seat. Karl had barely heard himself, had Fred shared his thoughts so fluently?**

**MARX:** I'm sure there's an explanation in our theory somewhere, Fred.

**ENGELS:** Forgive me Karl, we are both clever men, but I doubt it. As an engineer myself, I can see how the large wheel steers the craft as a ship's rudder would. But the levers and pedals are **all** involved in the control of our speed, it's a bewildering labyrinth of function.

**MARX:** Ah, I see. Well, it certainly goes to show that an industrial base exists somewhere in Chinese society, doesn't it! No doubt there are sophisticated technical minds at this headquarters that might explain it to you. This Chairman I'm sure will have some experience of engineering!

**ENGELS:** I hope we will be able to see how it is constructed. Do you think they have socket wrenches yet?

**KARL:** Perhaps, we shall have to ask. Let's continue our observations for now.

**As Karl looked beyond the carriages threshold once more the rice fields gave way to a brief stretch of pasture, then an abrupt shudder gave out as the carriage crossed a sturdy wooden bridge after which the carriage slowed gently and came to a stop. Karl caught a glimpse of people washing sheets in the river when a uniformed figure intercepted his view.**

**SENTRY:** So it is true. Imperialist spies, and so close to our heartland.

**KARL:** We are not spies of any kind. We are scholars, and scientists.

**SENTRY:** It will become clear in time.

**COMMANDER LUHAI:** It is not for us to judge, comrade. I am to take them straight to the Chairman's Dining Room.

**SENTRY:** Ha, of course, Commander. Am I also invited?

**COMMANDER LUHAI:** Open the barrier, immediately.

**The sentry's realisation was immediate.**

**SENTRY:** Yes, sir. Forgive me.

**The carriage passed through the small settlement slowly, a brisk walk would have met it's pace. A trio of young children stared in awe at the two men in the back as they passed, the youngest of them gesturing to the elders and pulling at their sleeves.**

**A turn in the road was followed by another sentry post, which seemed to have been cleared in advance. Beyond, set upon a man made hill was the only building they had seen that boasted more than a single story; and the population of servicemen alone seemed to equal that of the village. As the carriage drew up to the steps that lead within, Karl glimpsed a stout figure on a balcony extending from the turret like structure to his right. The sunlight obscured details, and before Karl could raise his arms to shade his eyes, the figure tossed something, a cigarette perhaps, and retreated within.**

**Both militiamen left the vehicle to entreat the forward sentries.**

**ENGELS:** This Chairman runs a tight ship, it would seem. I would not say that all these men are equal, would you Karl?

**MARX:** Indeed, Fred. Though they are clearly organised, and united in purpose. But is this *truly* a revolutionary headquarters?

**ENGELS:** What gives you pause?

**MARX:** These are fighting men, but surely not an army. If this is the capital of the revolution, surely it would be better guarded? No cavalry or cannon can be seen.

**ENGELS:** Just because we can not see them, does not mean they are not there. You haven't gotten around to explaining how a revolution should be carried out yet, have you?

**MARX:** No. It's not in the book...

**The carriage door to Marx's left swung open.**

**COMMISSAR SU:** Welcome gentlemen. I am Commissar Su, Director of Communications. Please alight the vehicle and come with me.

**The melodic tones of femininity had left Karl and Fred stunned for a moment. As they turned toward the source they saw an immaculately uniformed figure no more than 4 feet and 10 inches tall. She looked no older than thirty.**

**COMMISSAR SU:** The Chairman will not have a meal served to this motor car, Doctors. Please come along.

**MARX:** Yes, of course madame we-

**COMMISSAR SU:** You may address me as Comrade Su or Commissar Su. Please do as I have instructed.

**Karl shuffled haphazardly as he raised his legs over the berth of the doorway and set his feet upon the tiles below. He rose to his feet and stepped aside as Fred followed suit.**

**COMMISSAR SU:** Ah, that won't do. Comrade Luhai, please remove our guests restraints.

**The Commander moved immediately to unfasten the cuffs around Karl and Fred's wrists. His deference to the diminutive figure was not lost on Karl.**

**COMMISSAR SU:** Thank you Comrade Commander, you may return to your assigned duties. Doctors, let us proceed.

**MARX:** Lead and we shall follow, Commissar.

**Her smile was curt, but sincere. Her pace was uncanny for a woman of her height, the two stout elders pounded a march into the building and across a foyer. As the trio advanced down a long corridor Commissar Su was met with salutes by each and every other occupant of the compound.** **With only 4 metres or so of the corridor remaining, she stopped at a door to their right, Karl tried not to seem short for breath. He failed.**

**COMMISSAR SU:** The Chairman is most looking forward to speaking with you, Doctors. If I may say so, I have not seen him so eager for a meeting in some time. First you will enjoy tea, as is Chinese custom, then dinner will be served.

**MARX**: May I..

**COMMISSAR SU:** I will answer your questions shortly, Doctor Marx. You are ""invited"" to use these washrooms to make yourselves ready. You must make do with the time you have, but I would advise you to bring as little Shaanxi hillside into the dining room as possible. The Chairman values hygiene and decorum in equal measure. He also prefers not to be kept waiting. Do not worry about making a mess, I will see that the facilities are cleaned after use What was your question Doctor Marx?

**MARX:** May I have some matches. I would very much like to smoke a cigar.

**COMMISSAR SU:** I do not doubt that The Chairman will gladly offer you a match. All the better to hurry along, yes?

**MARX:** I can't argue with that.

**The washroom was not luxurious, but it did have hot running water, in a rural community such as this that was quite remarkable. It seemed unlikely to Fred or Karl that this was something the villagers had been afforded. Fred had already begun cleaning his hands in one of three basins**

**ENGELS:** A remarkable young woman that commissar, don't you think.

**MARX:** Indeed, she seems to have no trouble taking charge. Do you think there are many like her here?

**ENGELS:** It would be a socialist principle to make it possible, wouldn't it?

**MARX:** I feel it would have to be, yes. There is a powerful class consciousness among these people, but not the sort I imagined. There is a troublingly strict hierarchy, but not through exploitation. The chain of command is bound by...

**ENGELS:** Purpose? Hope?

**MARX:** Hope? Idealism, totally inadequate. But more fundamental than cause or purpose. Solidarity, as a matter of principle, I think that is what I sense.

**The soap available bore no scent, but it was of good quality and lathered well. A set of brushes scraped the worst of the dirt from their shoes, but their jackets would need a thorough cleaning to be dinner worthy. Regardless, they had done their best, and Commissar Su's knuckles had struck the door.**

**Fred and Karl observed themselves in the mirrors mounted to the walls before they stepped back into the corridor. The Commissar assessed them both.**

**COMMISSAR SU**: Not optimal, but acceptable. Under the circumstances I am sure The Chairman will understand. This way, please.

**The Commissar opened both of the dual doors at the hallways end.**

**COMMISSAR SU:** Comrade Chairman, your guests have arrived.

**The voice that came from the far end of the hall was unique; a graceful instrument of instruction and command, it was as though each syllable had been chosen in ancient times for the moment then at hand.**

**THE CHAIRMAN:** As always, Comrade Director, your timing is perfect. Please show the Doctors to the lounge seating. The tea will be ready in 84 seconds.

**The Commissar wordlessly ushered the two men through the doors, gestured them to remove their jackets and took them to a nearby coat stand.**

**The room was large and well furnished, though by no means ostentatiously so. To call it a dining room was hardly the full picture, the seating they were guided to was plain to the eye but cosy and well kept, the table in the center was set for 3 and the closest corner housed a small library, shelved from floor to ceiling, 4 paces from the wall a writing desk of solid wood. Atop the desk was what appeared to be a writing machine that Karl had seen prototype drawings of back home.**

**THE CHAIRMAN:** There is a matchbook on the coffee table for you, Doctor Marx. Please take them all, my kerosene lighter serves me for cigarettes. The machine you are looking at is indeed a writing machine, of German production no less. In this era, the common name for the device is a typewriter.

**Karl looked toward the figure in the dimly lit reaches of the chamber, his back still turned on them. He reached for the matches and took his cigar from his pocket.**

**THE CHAIRMAN:** Comrade Su, I would prefer my guests and I are not disturbed for the remainder of the evening. Is there anything you require me to arrange before I stand relieved?

**The light ringing of porcelain being stacked on a tray can be heard from the far end of the room.**

**COMMISSAR SU:** No Comrade Chairman, is there anything you require before I return to my duties?

**The Chairman had stepped into the light. The face was not what Karl had expected, wise but not wisened, almost joyful. The voice made sense now, balanced between extremes.**

**THE CHAIRMAN:** Your service to the people is beyond reproach, Jianming.

**COMMISSAR SU:** Thank you, Comrade Chairman. You honour me. I bid you all a good evening.

**The door closed quietly as The Chairman set the tea set upon the table, and placed a cup in reach of each of his guests. In a silence neither Karl or Fred dared to break, he poured the tea with the same grace he carried in his voice. He shifted the remaining chair slightly to better see both his guests and took his seat. His eyes met Karl's.**

Still trying to put fine touches on The Chairman's confrontation. It's gonna take a little bit. I've had comments and a couple of DMs of appreciation though, and I'm enjoying the writing.

======================================================  
**The automated carriage was not the most comfortable means of travelling, after some adjustment to the strange motion Karl found the speed exhilirating. Fred was clearly fascinated by the engineering involved, his eyes following the pilots management of various levers and switches with intense interest.**

**Karl was entirely pre-occupied with the human machinery at work beyond the vehicles' hull. As the fields rushed by, he could barely glimpse a worker for a moment, but as each paddy passed he saw that each matched a pattern. The labour carried on about them was in a clumsy unison. It's form was not mandated by any foreman he could determine, nor did the machines of their trade demand a certain pace, for machinery of any sort seemed scarce. The farm workers kept the rhythm of their labour by some other means.**

**Words left his mouth on a breath, barely audible.**

**MARX:** That's not in the book...

**ENGELS:** How do you suppose it works?

**Karl's head turned suddenly, Commander Luhai clutched his rifle in response to the sudden motion. He relaxed quickly but continued scanning both men from the passenger seat. Karl had barely heard himself, had Fred shared his thoughts so fluently?**

**MARX:** I'm sure there's an explanation in our theory somewhere, Fred.

**ENGELS:** Forgive me Karl, we are both clever men, but I doubt it. As an engineer myself, I can see how the large wheel steers the craft as a ship's rudder would. But the levers and pedals are **all** involved in the control of our speed, it's a bewildering labyrinth of function.

**MARX:** Ah, I see. Well, it certainly goes to show that an industrial base exists somewhere in Chinese society, doesn't it! No doubt there are sophisticated technical minds at this headquarters that might explain it to you. This Chairman I'm sure will have some experience of engineering!

**ENGELS:** I hope we will be able to see how it is constructed. Do you think they have socket wrenches yet?

**KARL:** Perhaps, we shall have to ask. Let's continue our observations for now.

**As Karl looked beyond the carriages threshold once more the rice fields gave way to a brief stretch of pasture, then an abrupt shudder gave out as the carriage crossed a sturdy wooden bridge after which the carriage slowed gently and came to a stop. Karl caught a glimpse of people washing sheets in the river when a uniformed figure intercepted his view.**

**SENTRY:** So it is true. Imperialist spies, and so close to our heartland.

**KARL:** We are not spies of any kind. We are scholars, and scientists.

**SENTRY:** It will become clear in time.

**COMMANDER LUHAI:** It is not for us to judge, comrade. I am to take them straight to the Chairman's Dining Room.

**SENTRY:** Ha, of course, Commander. Am I also invited?

**COMMANDER LUHAI:** Open the barrier, immediately.

**The sentry's realisation was immediate.**

**SENTRY:** Yes, sir. Forgive me.

**The carriage passed through the small settlement slowly, a brisk walk would have met it's pace. A trio of young children stared in awe at the two men in the back as they passed, the youngest of them gesturing to the elders and pulling at their sleeves.**

**A turn in the road was followed by another sentry post, which seemed to have been cleared in advance. Beyond, set upon a man made hill was the only building they had seen that boasted more than a single story; and the population of servicemen alone seemed to equal that of the village. As the carriage drew up to the steps that lead within, Karl glimpsed a stout figure on a balcony extending from the turret like structure to his right. The sunlight obscured details, and before Karl could raise his arms to shade his eyes, the figure tossed something, a cigarette perhaps, and retreated within.**

**Both militiamen left the vehicle to entreat the forward sentries.**

**ENGELS:** This Chairman runs a tight ship, it would seem. I would not say that all these men are equal, would you Karl?

**MARX:** Indeed, Fred. Though they are clearly organised, and united in purpose. But is this *truly* a revolutionary headquarters?

**ENGELS:** What gives you pause?

**MARX:** These are fighting men, but surely not an army. If this is the capital of the revolution, surely it would be better guarded? No cavalry or cannon can be seen.

**ENGELS:** Just because we can not see them, does not mean they are not there. You haven't gotten around to explaining how a revolution should be carried out yet, have you?

**MARX:** No. It's not in the book...

**The carriage door to Marx's left swung open.**

**COMMISSAR SU:** Welcome gentlemen. I am Commissar Su, Director of Communications. Please alight the vehicle and come with me.

**The melodic tones of femininity had left Karl and Fred stunned for a moment. As they turned toward the source they saw an immaculately uniformed figure no more than 4 feet and 10 inches tall. She looked no older than thirty.**

**COMMISSAR SU:** The Chairman will not have a meal served to this motor car, Doctors. Please come along.

**MARX:** Yes, of course madame we-

**COMMISSAR SU:** You may address me as Comrade Su or Commissar Su. Please do as I have instructed.

**Karl shuffled haphazardly as he raised his legs over the berth of the doorway and set his feet upon the tiles below. He rose to his feet and stepped aside as Fred followed suit.**

**COMMISSAR SU:** Ah, that won't do. Comrade Luhai, please remove our guests restraints.

**The Commander moved immediately to unfasten the cuffs around Karl and Fred's wrists. His deference to the diminutive figure was not lost on Karl.**

**COMMISSAR SU:** Thank you Comrade Commander, you may return to your assigned duties. Doctors, let us proceed.

**MARX:** Lead and we shall follow, Commissar.

**Her smile was curt, but sincere. Her pace was uncanny for a woman of her height, the two stout elders pounded a march into the building and across a foyer. As the trio advanced down a long corridor Commissar Su was met with salutes by each and every other occupant of the compound.** **With only 4 metres or so of the corridor remaining, she stopped at a door to their right, Karl tried not to seem short for breath. He failed.**

**COMMISSAR SU:** The Chairman is most looking forward to speaking with you, Doctors. If I may say so, I have not seen him so eager for a meeting in some time. First you will enjoy tea, as is Chinese custom, then dinner will be served.

**MARX**: May I..

**COMMISSAR SU:** I will answer your questions shortly, Doctor Marx. You are ""invited"" to use these washrooms to make yourselves ready. You must make do with the time you have, but I would advise you to bring as little Shaanxi hillside into the dining room as possible. The Chairman values hygiene and decorum in equal measure. He also prefers not to be kept waiting. Do not worry about making a mess, I will see that the facilities are cleaned after use What was your question Doctor Marx?

**MARX:** May I have some matches. I would very much like to smoke a cigar.

**COMMISSAR SU:** I do not doubt that The Chairman will gladly offer you a match. All the better to hurry along, yes?

**MARX:** I can't argue with that.

**The washroom was not luxurious, but it did have hot running water, in a rural community such as this that was quite remarkable. It seemed unlikely to Fred or Karl that this was something the villagers had been afforded. Fred had already begun cleaning his hands in one of three basins**

**ENGELS:** A remarkable young woman that commissar, don't you think.

**MARX:** Indeed, she seems to have no trouble taking charge. Do you think there are many like her here?

**ENGELS:** It would be a socialist principle to make it possible, wouldn't it?

**MARX:** I feel it would have to be, yes. There is a powerful class consciousness among these people, but not the sort I imagined. There is a troublingly strict hierarchy, but not through exploitation. The chain of command is bound by...

**ENGELS:** Purpose? Hope?

**MARX:** Hope? Idealism, totally inadequate. But more fundamental than cause or purpose. Solidarity, as a matter of principle, I think that is what I sense.

**The soap available bore no scent, but it was of good quality and lathered well. A set of brushes scraped the worst of the dirt from their shoes, but their jackets would need a thorough cleaning to be dinner worthy. Regardless, they had done their best, and Commissar Su's knuckles had struck the door.**

**Fred and Karl observed themselves in the mirrors mounted to the walls before they stepped back into the corridor. The Commissar assessed them both.**

**COMMISSAR SU**: Not optimal, but acceptable. Under the circumstances I am sure The Chairman will understand. This way, please.

**The Commissar opened both of the dual doors at the hallways end.**

**COMMISSAR SU:** Comrade Chairman, your guests have arrived.

**The voice that came from the far end of the hall was unique; a graceful instrument of instruction and command, it was as though each syllable had been chosen in ancient times for the moment then at hand.**

**THE CHAIRMAN:** As always, Comrade Director, your timing is perfect. Please show the Doctors to the lounge seating. The tea will be ready in 84 seconds.

**The Commissar wordlessly ushered the two men through the doors, gestured them to remove their jackets and took them to a nearby coat stand.**

**The room was large and well furnished, though by no means ostentatiously so. To call it a dining room was hardly the full picture, the seating they were guided to was plain to the eye but cosy and well kept, the table in the center was set for 3 and the closest corner housed a small library, shelved from floor to ceiling, 4 paces from the wall a writing desk of solid wood. Atop the desk was what appeared to be a writing machine that Karl had seen prototype drawings of back home.**

**THE CHAIRMAN:** There is a matchbook on the coffee table for you, Doctor Marx. Please take them all, my kerosene lighter serves me for cigarettes. The machine you are looking at is indeed a writing machine, of German production no less. In this era, the common name for the device is a typewriter.

**Karl looked toward the figure in the dimly lit reaches of the chamber, his back still turned on them. He reached for the matches and took his cigar from his pocket.**

**THE CHAIRMAN:** Comrade Su, I would prefer my guests and I are not disturbed for the remainder of the evening. Is there anything you require me to arrange before I stand relieved?

**The light ringing of porcelain being stacked on a tray can be heard from the far end of the room.**

**COMMISSAR SU:** No Comrade Chairman, is there anything you require before I return to my duties?

**The Chairman had stepped into the light. The face was not what Karl had expected, wise but not wisened, almost joyful. The voice made sense now, balanced between extremes.**

**THE CHAIRMAN:** Your service to the people is beyond reproach, Jianming.

**COMMISSAR SU:** Thank you, Comrade Chairman. You honour me. I bid you all a good evening.

**The door closed quietly as The Chairman set the tea set upon the table, and placed a cup in reach of each of his guests. In a silence neither Karl or Fred dared to break, he poured the tea with the same grace he carried in his voice. He shifted the remaining chair slightly to better see both his guests and took his seat. His eyes met Karl's.**

**THE CHAIRMAN:** Well, Doctor Marx, it is an honour to receive you. I suppose I have some explaining to do, don't I?

For example, we could talk about recent travels, future plans, travel tips, favorite experiences/places etc. If you were to go to a monthly meetup what would you like to talk about? Looking for cool ideas to incorporate into the club. Maybe like 1 yearly group trip, reading travel books, maybe a prompt where each person talks about their favorite country. 

Maybe the club would inspire people to travel to new places and just build community/connection. Some of the best people in the world are the other travelers I meet abroad, and would be cool to connect when I am not traveling. It seems like having a subscription and posting on the Meetup app could be an easy way to host events, but it seems like it would cost $200 for 6 months. Also maybe promoting on the local city reddit page could be a cheaper option.

Rowena knew the adults that fed her were not her parents. Parents didn’t have magical contracts that forced you to use your magical gifts for them, and they didn’t hurt you when you disobeyed. Slavery under magical contracts are also illegal in the Kingdom of Erisdale, which is prospering peacefully after a great continent-wide war.

Rowena’s owners don’t know, however, that she can see potential futures and anyone’s past that is not her own. She uses these powers to escape and break her contract and go on her own journey. She is going to find who she is, and keep her clairvoyance secret

Yet, Rowena’s attempts to uncover who she is drives her into direct conflict with those that threaten the peace and prove far more complicated than she could ever expect. Finding who you are after all, is simply not something you can solve with any kind of magic.

“Your father and mother are acting quickly,” said Gwen that morning as the trio assembled in the mansion's dining room for breakfast.

“We don’t know what Alastor or Forlana want. Well, we know Forlana wants Erisdale, but does Alastor want it?” Jess asked.

Rowena ate slowly, swallowing automatically as she forced the toast and butter down her throat. “We will find out. First, though, I need to talk to Frances.”

“It’s going to be fine, Wena,” said Jess.

“I don’t know. I’ve talked to Morgan and Hattie many times, but the last time I had an actual conversation with Archmage Frances, I was thirteen,” said Rowena.

“What are you so worried about? You’re not still angry at her, are you?” Jess asked.

“It’s the opposite,” said Rowena. She sighed and took a deep sip of her coffee. “Sorry, can we talk about something else?”

Gwen pursed her lips. “Wena, just to check. Have you had any visions?”

“Not related to this. Just one of an extremely distant future. It is annoying, I haven’t seen anything about this happening,” said Rowena.

“Could you try seeing into the past, though? To find out more about their plans?” Gwen asked.

Rowena blinked and grinned. “That’s a good idea. I’ll give it a shot after my meeting. How are things with Teutobal by the way?”

Gwen sighed, allowing herself to look a little dreamy-eyed in front of her friends. “I’m not sure how to describe it, but it’s been perfect. We do disagree, we do argue, and I daresay that our bethrothal was for practical reasons, but we are enjoying things. I am counting the days to our next date. We’re planning to go to a snowy retreat in the northern mountains with just a few servants attending.”

Jess crooned, “Awww, that sounds delightful.”

“I know. Have you two had a chance to go on a date?” Gwen asked.

Rowena felt her cheeks burn because no, she hadn’t had a chance to ask Jess on a date, even if she’d lost count of the situations that they’d been together that would probably count as dates.

“No, we have not,” said Jess. Rowena slowly turned her head to see Jess grinning at her with half-lidded eyes. “But we will rectify that soon, right Rowena?”

“We’re in hostile territory…” Rowena pursed her lips as Jess’s shoulders sagged. Coughing into her fist, the princess took a breath. “... with an entire brigade of guards. I think we can make a date happen. Would you be available for a walk in the gardens this evening?”

Jess blinked. “Wait, really?”

Rowena nodded to herself and to her girlfriend. “We’ll just need to be careful. Besides, I lost ten years of my life to kidnappers. I’m not wasting any more time.”

She smiled at Jess, took her hand, and, raising the fingers to her lips, kissed her knuckles gently. 

“Gods, I love you, Wena,” Jess whispered.

Rowena’s cheeks burned even brighter as Gwen giggled behind her hand.

\*\*\*

Rowena had sat down about ten minutes before the 9th hour when her mirror started to shake. Placing it on the vanity, she tapped it to activate the call, but it wasn’t who she expected.

“Morgan? Hattie?” Rowena stammered.

“Hey, Wena. We heard a little from Frances,” said Hattie.

Morgan waved at Hattie, smiling encouragingly. “We know you’re meeting mom soon. We just wanted to call you and let you know you got this.”

Rowena swallowed and blinked back suddenly moist eyes. “Thank you. I’ll let you know if I get any visions. Unfortunately, I haven’t got any of note.”

Morgan grimaced. “Figures. Just when you really want them.”

The princess groaned. “I know right?”

“Don’t forget to talk to your friends and your family,” said Hattie.

“Remember, you don’t have to take it all on by yourself,” said Morgan.

Rowena nodded. “Thank you. I’ll see you soon,” she said, to promise herself. She waved at her dear teachers, who waved back, and the image faded.

In what seemed like seconds later, her mirror glowed again, and a new face swam into view.

Archmage Frances was a little older than she’d last seen her, but that’s not what made Rowena do a double-take. She recognized that the mage was in her office, which she’d been in before. The background was filled with bookshelves and a pair of sword hooks where her estoc rested. Frances had a map that her hand mirror seemed to be put on top of, along with a book that she had open.

What Rowena found herself staring at was a golden circlet resting on Frances's head. It was made of the same gold that trimmed the official-looking White Order robes she wore.

“Good morning, Archmage Frances,” said Rowena, hoping she didn’t look underdressed. She hadn’t thought to put on anything ostentatious.

Frances put her book down and smiled, and Rowena found herself letting out a small breath. 

“Good morning, Rowena. Apologies for the getup. I have a number of important persons to ring given what I learnt from your mother and father.”

“I really should be the one saying sorry, Frances,” said Rowena, bowing her head.

Frances blinked. “Sorry about—Oh.”

Rowena took a breath. “I don’t know how to start, and this is really the worst time.”

“I’m still glad, and I know you’ll find the words. I’m not in a rush,” said Frances.

The princess smiled, wondering if she was reflecting Frances or just trying to make herself feel better. Whatever it was, it was working as Rowena could feel her pounding heartbeat soften.

“Frances, I’m sorry for blaming you for my kidnapping. You were doing your best. Things just… happened.”

“Oh, Rowena. Thank you,” said Frances, wiping her eyes with a hand. “You’re forgiven, though. I don’t blame you for blaming me. I very might have done the same in your situation.”

“I very much doubt that,” said Rowena, wincing at the wryness in her voice.

Frances opened her mouth before closing it, only to let out a small sigh. “Morgan and Hattie may have mentioned this, but mages sometimes struggle with strong emotions affecting their magic, leading them to go into a destructive situation called a Mage Trance. For a long time, I’ve struggled with anger, and even fell into a mage trance before because of it.”

Rowena’s jaw had dropped open. “No way,” she whispered.

“Oh yes. I still struggle with my anger and not letting it dictate my decisions. I still attend therapy,” said Frances.

“We’re all only human, or Alavari,” said Rowena in a quiet voice.

“Exactly.” Frances brushed back a lock of her hair. “If you don’t mind me asking, what brought this on, Rowena?”

The princess bowed her head. “Father and mother were part of it. They didn’t deliberately try to change my mind, but you were a frequent character in many of their stories. Tiamara was the other reason. She’s one of my best friends. I don’t want to be angry at her mother.” Rowena took a breath. “The events of yesterday, though, hammered it home for me. I challenged Alastor without thinking. I didn’t have time to assess what I knew and act carefully. I realize now that that must have been what you were facing when you were going to rescue me. You had limited time, imperfect information. You could only do what you thought was right.”

Frances nodded, her lips quirked in a wince. “I did have more time than you did, Rowena, and I am more experienced than you are.”

“You are, but now I understand that we’re human and we make mistakes. You’ve more than apologized for yours.” Rowena took a breath. “The thing is, I need your help once again. Erisdale needs the White Order to intercede, or we may have another war on our hands.”

“You are aware that as much as I personally want to help you, I’m not sure if the White Order can do so,” said Frances, a slight wince passing through her expression.

“Just hear me out,” Rowena said.

Frances leaned forward on her elbows. “Rowena, if need be, I will resign my position as Grandmaster and personally go to Erisdale to protect your family. I owe it to you, and your father and mother. I just want to let you know I’m not sure how much the Treaty of Athelda-Aoun will let us get involved .”

Rowena had to stop herself from gawking at Frances. She knew the archmage was close with her parents, and she had hoped that maybe her plea would save her. Yet, she didn’t expect Frances to say that.

“Isn’t the White Order everything to you?”

“My friends and family are everything, Rowena. Now, tell me what do you want,” said Frances.

The princess swallowed and sat up a little straighter.

“First, I’d like to ask if The White Order and the Lightning Battalion to deploy a peacekeeping force between Erisdale and Lapanteria,” said Rowena.

Frances gritted her teeth. “You know the treaty says both countries have to agree to this.”

“Are there any exceptions? Especially since Alastor is jeopardizing the treaty right now?” Rowena asked.

Frances shook her head, looking as frustrated as Rowena felt. “He’s technically not broken that treaty. Challenged it? Undermined it? Put himself in a position to break it and get maximum benefit? Yes, but not actually broken it. It only stipulates no war or offensive actions between Erisdale, Lapanteria, Erlenberg and Alavaria.”

“Alright, but can you mobilize your troops and mages in preparation for if this gets out of hand?” Rowena asked.

“Already done. I’ve got the Lightning Battalion standing by in Alavaria, ready to move out. From the reports I’ve gotten, Lapanteria’s not interfering with our branch offices, but I’m not deploying soldiers into that border area until we’re asked,” said Frances.

“Thank you. My second request is a bit more complicated. My father, mother and I have been trying to get in contact with King Sebastian but we’ve not been successful. Can the White Order try to contact him? Get him to stop Alastor?” Rowena asked.

Frances amber eyes crinkled with mischievous glee. “We’re not supposed to interfere with another country’s affairs. However, now that you ask, I think I have a way around this. King Sebastian was the one who signed the agreement with the White Order to help support Lapanteria’s rural communities. There’s no proxy and given his medical condition, it was high time we renegotiated. I can have an envoy approach the Crystal Palace and get him to speak to me.”

“That’s fantastic. Thank you,” said Rowena. She pursed her lips. “There is one more thing. It’s not a request, but a question.”

“Ask away,” said Frances in a cheerful tone.

“Why hasn’t anybody intervened in the Lapanterian-Roranoak conflict? I had a discussion with Root-King Eldecar, and it’s a bit strange that nobody, not even the White Order, has intervened in it,” said Rowena.

Frances' smile twitched before failing as she glanced over her shoulder. Waving her wand, Rowena heard her mumble a spell. “Are you in private?”

“Yes,” said Rowena, nodding slowly.

“The White Order has been assisting Roranoak for some time through humanitarian work. We’ve been doing so in secret and keeping it a secret even from Roranoak,” said Frances. 

Rowena flinched. “But why? I thought the Order was supposed to remain neutral?”

“We could hardly do nothing when Alastor is forcibly relocating civilians from their homes. However, to not start another continent-wide war, we could only do our best to save Roranoak lives and train up their mages. Remember, Roranoak doesn’t have a formal contract with the White Order. They have banned our mages and the Lightning Battalion from entering their borders,” said Frances.

Rowena mulled over this information, her fingers clenching and unclenching. “Do my father and mother know?”

“Yes. They didn’t like the subterfuge, but it was do something, or do nothing at all,” said Frances.

Rowena jumped to her feet, hands almost propelling her into her mirror. “Wait, then you might have intelligence on what Forlana was doing. Like, who is supporting her, and how she met Alastor.”

Frances almost shook her head, but paused. “There is something. Lady Veina’s involvement in the Roranoak-Lapanterian conflict occurred shortly after the failed assassination of Queen Ginger. We know now that it was Forlana, which tells us that Lapanteria may have been working with Forlana for some time.”

“How long? And are you certain?” Rowena asked.

“To an extent. We know when Lady Veina got involved with the fighting. We also know that Lapanteria wouldn’t just enlist a foreign mage without good reason. They have mages of their own and other magic-gifted nobles they could deploy. Yet, they sent Veina.” Frances leaned back, arms hugging herself. “Roranoak may have been a test for Forlana. Something she offered to do for Alastor as a third party to keep Lapanterian hands clean. It would explain why the conspiracy’s activities in Erisdale lessened. Forlana probably brought her supporters with her to Roranoak.”

“Could that also be where their power base is? Far away from where Erisdale can reach them?” Rowena asked.

Frances checked her map. “Alastor did grant Veina—Forlana, lands in that area and a castle.”

“Then that’s where her loyalists are.” Rowena took a breath. “I’m going to talk to Eldecar. If he agrees to it, can you organize a raid on the castle?”

“You want us to raid Lapanterian territory?” Frances squawked.

“I’m asking you to arrest people in disputed territory that Lapanteria itself declared are criminals, like the mage Benjamin, who has to be there,” said Rowena.

“I can have someone investigate if Benjamin and other suspects are there. You need to talk to Eldecar. I have to ask, though, why? Raiding that castle won’t stop a war.”

Rowena swallowed, thinking back to what she saw between Forlana and Alastor.

“Right now, Erisdale has no diplomatic means to stop Lapanteria from invading us if they wish. We only have the strength of our army. If we find evidence of them having incited war and harboring criminals, I might be able to persuade more allies to apply pressure,” said Rowena.

“I see. If it’s our only lead, I will pursue it. Just make sure to talk to Eldecar in case we do find something. Is there anything else, Rowena?”

Rowena was about to shake her head, but a thought occurred to her. “One last question.”

Frances giggled. “Go ahead.”

“I’ve… I’ve not had any visions of this event or anything related. Morgan and Hattie have been consulting texts but haven’t found anything. Is there a reason why I’m not having visions for this? I wouldn’t normally want a vision, but many times when I faced some danger, I saw something at least.”

Looking up at the ceiling, Frances’ gaze grew distant.

“There is a reason. Morgan and Hattie probably have considered it, but it’s not a pleasant reason, and so they are probably exploring other options first.” Frances looked Rowena in the eye. “Did you know there are ways to block scrying, Rowena?”

Rowena’s blood ran cold as she shook her head.

“Magical communication has become increasingly common after the war, and they rely on a form of scrying spell where you focus on seeing and hearing someone or something far in the distance. These communications are very valuable, particularly on the battlefield, so people have been working on figuring out a way to jam these signals.” Frances grimaced and crossed her arms. “Now, the practicality of these spells is debatable. It’s been found that you can temporarily disrupt or jam a spell, but then the other party can just recast it, and the link can be established quickly. Maintaining these spells is also incredibly magic-intensive.”

“My dreams—you think because they are a form of scrying that they might be affected? But I’m not seeing the now, I’m seeing the past or the future,” Rowena said.

“Yes, but you are still seeing a fixed point in space and time. Magic in Durannon may be fantastical and can do the impossible, but it doesn’t break the rules of energy and space, so much as creatively bends them. Now that does mean you might be able to counter this, but of course, if they are jamming you, that raises a far more troubling possibility,” said Frances.

Rowena blinked until her mind finally caught up. As the realization hit her, she felt like she was going to vomit.

“They know. They know about my visions.”

“We don’t know that for sure, Rowena, but I would be even more careful than you are now. Never go anywhere alone. Never accept any gifts that aren’t checked, never eat any food that isn’t tested.” Frances forced a smile on her face. “You know what danger you are in. Just remember that you are loved and people will support you.”

Rowena swallowed, but she did feel better. “Thank you, Frances. And I’m sorry again.”

“Apology accepted, and I’m sorry that I couldn’t be more help.”

“Don’t be. You’re doing everything you can,” said Rowena. She waved at the archmage who waved back as the image in the mirror faded.

\*\*\*

Sitting in the room with Jess and Gwen, Rowena gripped Tristelle in her hand as she closed her eyes. The scent of incense filled the room, emptying her mind and allowing her to focus.

To test Frances' realization, she was trying to cast her mind back to Forlana and Alastor’s meeting. She knew it had to be after the assassination attempt on her mother in Athelda-Aoun. She knew that shortly after, Forlana had moved to Roranoak. It wasn’t much, but she should be able to see something.

But what if Forlana was really blocking her visions? What would happen then? Would she be able to see Forlana and Alastor anyway? Or would she see nothing? Would she get hurt? Would it be painful—

Rowena shook her head, clasping tightly onto her sword as she channelled her power, but as the pink butterflies that represented her power materialized in the darkness, she knew her focus was off. All that was left was to see what she was going to see.

“What is he doing?” asked a voice she had heard not long ago.

Rowena opened her eyes. Alastor was several years younger, resplendent in a gold and purple striped cloak and a sleek black doublet. He didn’t wear—or to be exact, he had not acquired the careless smile that he had worn to his wedding. Rather, he was glaring across the table in a small sitting room.

The guards around him, two with swords and pistols, the other a mage with a staff, were all tensed as they glared at Benjamin.

Benjamin was holding onto a crystal ball that was topped by a circlet of gemstones. He had been mumbling something as he cast, but had stopped it at Alastor’s question.

Forlana rose to her feet. She’d been sitting at the table and wearing an orange dress that most would find scandalous, with how it exposed her shoulders and upper chest. Waltzing over to Alastor, she fixed his attention with a seductive smile and held onto it as she wrapped her bare arms around his right arm.

“That is my mentor, Benjamin, and that’s just a security device. It’s meant to prevent people from spying on us.”

“We could just cast the usual anti-listening charms,” said Alastor.

Forlana giggled, but Rowena noticed her grip on his arm tightened ever so slightly. “This one’s more effective  and foolproof.”

Alastor arched an eyebrow. Rowena wasn’t sure if it was how tightly Forlana seemed to press herself against Alastor or the reassuring smile Benjamin flashed towards him, but the prince nodded slowly. 

Benjamin went back to casting his spell, and suddenly, Rowena felt herself yanked back. A new magic glow, Benjamin’s green-tinted power all she could see as she reappeared back in the present. Blinking to get the glow of green out of his vision, Rowena seized Jess and Gwen’s supportive hands.

“They know, and yes, they are jamming me.

If you ever loved someone — or even just liked someone — then you know this feeling. 
In the peak heat of summer, after seeing that person, suddenly you feel like it’s autumn inside you.
October, November… the very start of the cold breeze, that soft harsh winter air. 
The season when leaves start falling from the trees, when everything feels like it’s changing — not 
in a sad way, but in a quiet, beautiful way. 
That’s the time when you feel something very different inside yourself. 
You feel energetic, full of positivity, and somehow everything starts to look romantic.
You want to enjoy everything with just one specific person.
Early in the morning, when you are alone, sometimes you feel empty or a little depressed. 
But when you’re with that person, suddenly you feel like waking up at 5 a.m. just to make coffee 
for them. 
You want to prepare breakfast in bed for your favorite person. 
Even if you don’t like cooking — you still cook, and you actually enjoy it when it’s for someone 
you love or care for more than anything.
You start noticing small details. 
You learn to watch the heat of the pan, the timing, the tiny things you never cared about before. 
And in that learning, in that effort, you feel something growing.
That’s when you realize: 
this is autumn living inside your soul.
You start to live life on full throttle. 
You breathe deeper. 
Everything feels different, yet somehow everything starts coming together. 
Your perspective changes — the world looks soft, warm, and meaningful.
And that exact moment… 
that’s when autumn begins — not outside, 
but in your life.🤍❤️",1,1765344782.0,writingcirclejerk,1,1.0,False

What do they mean?,"The first one was a while back after a party during which I hugged my former classmate [17f] (I [17m] couldn't believe it when my friends told me since im not attractive and she was the queen of our school). We barely talked in school but on the party we were talking and the last words of hers I remember were either 'I thought' or 'I was thinking' (both are told the same in my language)

The first one, I had to take of the shoes and but them in a bag before going into a store. Then when i came back i saw that the bag had another pair. Then this girl comes, tells me something i dont remember, i take out the shoes for her, she thanks me and we share our goodbyes, but it turned out we were going the same way and talks something. Next thing that happens, we're playing csgo together on Cache (i loved the map and still miss it)

Next one i faintly remember:
I was going somewhere, and passed a goth girl in a doorway (I'm not into goth). We looked back at eachother. Next thing I remember is I go talk to her and keep stuttering but we went and grabbed a coffee together 

The last one was tonight:
I was in a classroom with my best friend talking about some fuel station guy that did something (possibly PDF-file). Then the bell rings and he goes somewhere and I go sit next to the classroom. Then there's this girl that comes up to me (she's real and I'm not attracted to her irl) and says I look cute right off the bat. I'm shocked, don't know what to say. Then she says 'lets go for a walk' and i say 'sure'. We start walking and we walk in two different directions. When I notice, I quickly go back to her. Next thing I remember we are in some kind of kitchen, there's me, her and the friend from earlier. I'm pouring tea for everyone. There's exactly 7L left after I do. And me and my friend come back to talking about the fuel station guy.

Looking for something more than just small talk and surface-level connections, I seek depth and I seek substance. Something long term that ages like fine wine, not something short term that fizzles out like soda pop.

Consciously seeking kindred spirits. Perhaps even my forever and always. But hey, even that kind of solid connection is best founded on the grounds of *pakka* friendship, don't you think? Forever is a long time, might as-well spend it with your best friend for life.

I just want someone to call my own. To talk about anything and everything with, to chat the day away, watch movies / binge on shows with each other, explore the city and cute cafés together, A genuine connection of mind, body and soul. My person, us against the world.

I’m 29, fit body with a sharp mind and a creative soul. A lover of all things nature, food, and animals. I’ve got messy hair, a dimple on my left cheek, and eyes that see deeper than most.

Witty banter, endless memes, and conversations that go far beyond the surface. I don’t want just passion, I want emotion. I want romance. I want chemistry that sets us both on fire.

I want to be your favorite notification and your go to distraction. I want to make your heart skip a beat when you see my name pop up on your screen, make you smile from cheek to cheek and bite your lips at the same time.

For unless it's mad, passionate, extraordinary love, it's a waste of time. There are many mediocre things in life, love should not be one of them.

So how do we do this? Coffee in a cute café filled with gingerbread smells? A day spent talking till the lights come on? A Christmas movie marathon with fuzzy socks? Let’s connect. Let me get to know you.

Naturally, all this action piqued the curiosity of the young family's 4-year-old daughter, who took an interest in all the activity going on next door and spent much of each day watching the workers.

Eventually, the construction crew, a good-hearted bunch, took a liking to the little girl and adopted her as a sort of project mascot.They would chat with her and let her sit with them while they took coffee and lunch breaks.  They would give her little jobs to do here and there to make her feel important, and at the end of the first week, they presented her with a ""pay envelope"" containing $10.

The little girl took this money home to her mother who suggested that she take her $10 ""pay"" to the bank and start a savings account.  The teller at the bank was duly impressed and asked the little girl how she managed to earn her very own paycheck at such an early age.  

The little girl proudly replied, ""I worked last week with a real construction crew building the new house next door to us.""

""My heavens, young lady,"" said the teller, ""and will you be working on the same house again this week, too?""

I realized the problem wasn't the big projects. It was all the tiny, stupid things floating around in my head. I was treating my brain like a messy notepad, and it was totally slowing me down.


The 3-Step Fix: How to Get it Out or Fix it:


1. Use notebook: Keep a dedicated notebook or notes app open.

2. Write immediately: The moment a random task pops up (""Buy socks""), write it down immediately. No exceptions.

3. Repeat it untill it become daily habit.


The takeaway: You're not disorganized. You're just fighting unsecured mental clutter.

 Externalize the tasks, and give your brain a break.

I don’t want to sound ungrateful in this post, I’m just feeling frustrated and need to vent. 

My partner and I recently (around mid August) moved in with his mom and sister. His mom is relatively knowledgeable about gluten free things due to her job and has friends with celiacs. If she makes dinner for everyone, she’s usually pretty good about making sure everything is certified GF (using tamari sauce, any Thai sauces/seasonings are certified gf). 

However, there was an incident recently where she made a meal for the whole family and poured beer in a soup she was making. She stopped midway through because my partner asked what she was doing, but she never told me that she put it in the soup. I heard the entire incident from the adjacent room, and my partner came in to tell me that she had in fact but beer in the soup. I had to confront her the next day and politely say that I knew there was beer and I’ll be having something else for dinner but please don’t feel bad, etc etc. Well this situation made me start thinking about other times I’ve been potentially eating something with gluten but I don’t know because I just trust her to be aware of it? Idk. I also just realized that our cooking utensils (we brought them from our no gluten apartment here and now everyone in the household uses them) are wooden and may be contaminating any food prepared since she cooks things with gluten for herself and others more often. 

I’ve had a pretty noticeable uptick in stomach issues which has lead me to trying to cut out other potential allergens (coffee, eggs, milk) but my stomach issues keep getting worse even with dietary changes. I’m just feeling really stressed and sad about it because I feel awful asking someone to be “better” about something that they are doing out of kindness. Like I just feel weird asking someone who is already outside of their comfort zone to be better about the no gluten thing. How would yall navigate this?

I live in Indonesia and love trying the beans from local roasteries here.

Thing is, the flavours can be a bit all over the place. Especially natural process beans can have a lot of funk or be extremely wine-y. Roast levels tend to be a bit darker than the light roasts you’d find in Europe.

Recently I’ve been getting a bit frustrated with all the funk that the ZP6 brings out for these coffees. And sometimes the flavours go in all directions and there is a lack of body and balance.

I’m adjusting my recipes, brewers, temperatures and so on, but sometimes I feel like it’s in the grinder.

I brew with V60, Origami and Kalita Tsubame Wave, and sometimes AeroPress. Also considering getting a Hario Switch as I imagine it’s quite different to the other brewers I have.

I (30F, Vegetarian) have just started ADF as a 240 lbs person. My gut and digestion are at their weakest right now. I am avoiding binge eating or heavy food on non -fasting days. I am mostly surviving on fruit-milk shakes, coffee, tea, legume soups. 

I already have weak hair. I am scared hair loss will increase, if I don't take regular food. Right now, I am taking Vit B12 with biotin tablets alternate days. I am also taking calcium and Vit D3 tablet once a week. 

I am hoping to continue doing ADF for the sake of healthy life style, not just for weight loss. My questions are 

1) What changes can I incorporate in my daily routine to take care of my skin and hair. 

2) People who chose ADF as a 'way of living '  how is it going for you? Are you finding ADF easier than switching to normal diet, especially after reaching your target weight? 

Please help me with long-term tips and experiences which have worked for you.

In som ways I’m grateful the relationship happened because it brought a lot of stuff to light for me that has been probably screaming to be addressed for years - trauma, horrible coping mechanisms, extreme emotions dysregulatiin and I’m now flirting with an ADHD diagnosis and the ADHD is really throwing me through a loop and making me see my entire life completely differently, and although I know I have it now, this realization mixed with so much deep shame tied to my CPTSD….I have literally no self esteem left. It literally physically hurts so much. I’ve never felt so low and so much pain in my chest so consistently. But, my ex partner, is the opposite of someone who has CPTSD and ADHD and we had such a horrible time trying to live together, I’m literally still living in a triggered state (especially before my period), even though I moved out over 2 months ago. But he was such a particular person and does not understand how people can procrastinate, or not immediately put a clean dish away, or close every single cabinet immediately, that feeling of being in trouble and not good enough awoke so much Dee shit in me that I think is tied to both the CPTSD and adhd and I am living in an emotional flashback almost constantly now. I am feeling so much shame, so much self loathing, so much pain, and my ex probably doesn’t even fully realized how his words deeply cut me even if it was just “why would you not put the coffee mug away??” (His tone could be horrible at times). 

This is just such a difficult thing to navigate because I want to protect the fact that he is a good person and never had bad intentions we were just truly such a horrible match and hated so many things about each other but it was never abusive in any way, just kind of both miserable by the end. But I find myself wanting to appease to him knowing what he liked around the house etc, subconsciously. I think it comes from my mom and that she was very similar but was extremely emotionally neglectful, volatile and had constant outbursts of anger. So that’s where these emotional flashbacks are coming from I think. 

But this spot of the deepest DEEPEST amount of shame, loathing, confusion and lost-ness has me almost debilitated lately. I don’t want to really engage with anyone, I want to go to work, come home eat watch tv scroll and sleep and that’s it. I have no capacity for anything else. My therapist kept trying to push me on this is depression - I tried explaining to her that I’m telling you it’s not. I think it’s 30 years of undiagnosed and uncontrolled ADHD that has gotten 10 fold worse in the last 2 years and being shamed for it for the last year by my ex (neither of us knew I had ADHD but neither of us also knew why I was so ‘lazy’, low irritability, tired, etc constantly), and also finally addressing some serious CPTSD issues like my fawning and freezing. My life has gotten completely blown up. But I wanted to scream at her it’s not depression there’s a reason no SSRI has ever worked on me. I also got diagnosed with Lyme disease 3 months ago. So………yeah, the last half of this year has put me in a place of reflection and brutal honesty wit myself I’ve ever experienced and I do not see the light at the end of the tunnel yet. 

This rant was kind of all over the place but damn I really feel lik this is the only safe space Reddit page that exists.  I feel like I used to be such a cool laid back girl with so much confidence and cared so little what people thought of me, positive, etc, and now I’m grumpy and tired 24/7, so so so irritable, mad about everything, cry at the drop of a pen an internalize almost every single thing any person says to me and somehow twist it in my head to make it seem like that person was saying I’m not good enough in some way.

I read every single thread here on international travel and a lot of people opt for disposables. However, we've been exclusively cloth since birth and have a 100% leak rate the few times we've been in disposables, so I was really more anxious on dealing with something unknown on the plane/away from home... my thought process was if we had leaks and blow outs with disposables I'd need to do laundry anyway. 

Before I did it I had three concerns: (1) how much of my stash should i pack? (2) how to find a laundromat/keep the wash routine (3) can I travel internationally with a suitcase full of dirty diapers?

I found conflicting info on (1) and (2) and could not find answer to (3) anywhere. So I'm sharing what I did in case anyone wants to try cloth on plane trips:

  
(1) In total, I packed 24 prefolds, 4 workhorses, 6 covers, 30 wipes, two small wet bags, a full size laundry bag, and a mason jar with enough laundry powder for 3 loads --> this is almost my entire stash. I used packing cubes and packed diapers+my kid's clothes/toys + my clothes/shoes in one checked roller bag. I personally had to pack light to make it work but it did. 

On the plane we had 5 diapers for a 6.5h flight. We also brought a thing of disposable wipes. Kiddo (amazingly) slept the entire flight there, so we did a diaper change when we landed at the airport but not on the plane. On the way back 7 hour, we did two plane diaper changes. I used the workhorses on the plane which made it pretty easy. 

(2) I was nervous about finding a laundromat in an unknown city, but I noticed one our 2nd night out to dinner that was walking distance from our hotel. Did laundry one morning while my husband took little one to the park and then for a nap. I actually LOVED having \~3 hours to myself to get some work done and have a cup of coffee alone. I treated doing laundry as a break rather than chore.

Routine wise I did my two washes: warm then hot. We usually do a vinegar rinse too but I skipped it. No issues, everything got clean. 

(3) I scoured the internet for an answer to can you fly internationally/go through customs with a bag full of dirty cloth diapers. I did it and had no problems. As with most things it seems in retrospect like a silly thing to be so worried about it. 

  
Anyway, everyone makes different choices, but if you think you might prefer to travel with cloth on planes and internationally, I wanted to share a very positive experience!",9,1765342107.0,clothdiaps,0,0.92,False

I just wanna go to college and move on with my life but it’s like I’m stuck. I’ve gained weight from the lack of being mobile, I stay in my house and rarely have energy to clean. It’s days I have two red bulls and a coffee just to do household chores and cook meals. Random pains that give me ptsd, I still have no hair basically because I had to keep shaving it. Whenever it grew my scalp was just in a lot of pain due to nerve damage, I just started to let it grow despite the pain. I just wanna look like myself and feel like myself. 

Like yes remission is good but it doesn’t take away from the daily bs I experience. Shit I literally almost died last month. I went into septic shock with no reasoning as to why and was hospitalized for over a week and i’m still not healed from that. It completely wiped my immune system, I had .3 WBC when I got there and .5 when I left. So now I have to go every week for shots and blood work. I have a 3 year old child and she’s the reason I’m still here. I’m extremely depressed because I hate the life in living. I have zero support system and no matter what I say to doctors the help isn’t really there. Even the oncologist stop caring once that cancer is gone. 

I’m constantly having anxiety attacks/crying spells because regardless of being in remission it’s a huge ass mass still next to my heart which causes problems in itself even with no active cancer. I always feel pains that remind me of cancer, which basically triggers thoughts of going through it again. Thoughts about not making it to see my daughter go to school, graduate, get married etc is preventing me of enjoying the time we have together now.  Everyone my age is living life like normal 20 something year olds yet I feel like i’m fucking 50. I’ve accomplished a lot this year and I try to acknowledge that but the negative in my life is outweighing the positive. I’m tired of the pain, exhaustion and was failed by all my family, and friends and am completely alone besides the man I’ve been seeing so more times than not I feel like I don’t wanna be here anymore and just feel guilt as I watch others lose their lives to the same shit.

Along with other consumption habits such as coffee, energy drinks, or even tequila! However, I still may indulge even now and then, but clearly with caution. Vitamin B complex never ceases to amaze me, but I'm very methodical with my supplemental regime when eating or drinking junk foods, sugary drinks, and alcohol. After consuming these minimally on average and moderately during the holidays such as now, I take vitamin B complex volume based on my consumption rate. Through trial, I figured out that take vitamin B throughout the day periodically absorbs into the body much better than taking them any other way. Example, I've eaten cookies, cakes, and pies during this holiday season and it's not even Christmas week yet, but I make sure to take (2) every 4-6 hours maybe 2-3x that day, and when the intake is sufficient, I don't experience epilepsy at all that same day or the next day. So this is for someone who either is trying to break a habit, is engaging in a social event, or occasionally indulging. If you can these foods please do, but in the event that you do, vitamin B complex is your ally. I also take some magnesium for extra anit-seizure help if I happen to overdo it lol.

So my sort center I think is odd but pls correct if wrong. AR plus manual sort & used to be an FC?) also r goals of 120k normal for 1 sort? But we also squeeze in a middle shift that doesn't really get credit/ have numbers to meet idk

Ok so LONG post but felt necessary for the whole picture.. also I am a direct person & not the put ur head down & get out/cuts corners type. Anywhere I have worked I have tried to leave it better than it was by contributing in what ever I can.

So I'm going to try to be factual yet vague for obv reasons. I'm a woman that's over 35.... Student, & marriedw/kids. & This is my first time working in a warehouse, it's temp for now. I'm a very hard worker & naturally fast & efficient in any job I've had. And I'm just very confused by the sort center I work at. I was hired on at a large sortation center as a pt seasonal employee ,( day & evening shift every wknd & Mon. evening shift). My first day of training was a month ago.

The center is huge & says fulfillment center on the sign when you enter the parking area but it is actually a sortation center along w/another department that does returns I think? That area is small &we are told those are a different set of Amazon employees w/ the same address but different ""location"". Also we were told our center is different , larger & also a test facility. Idk.
So my 1st day on the floor another AA commented that our training group received poor training from the brand new trainers (yes it did feel that way). We weren't even given a full tour of the facility amongst other things like showing us how to cart wrangler/sortation in runouts. Ok so that being said I really would appreciate help on understanding what's going on/insight. So I don't really know the correct terminology for everything so bear w/me. My training group was told that we were hired to do 1 of 3 tasks - container build, cart wrangler, and container load I think? (Unsure of the last 1 but basically walking the filled pallets/carts from 1 spot to another per ur scanner & scanning the location/correct bar codes- also this one u are timed on & someone from my training group was pulled by management when she took too long to get her go cart to the correct location in the building. This was like her 1st week after training 😬

So I've only done the 1st 2 ( & fyi on my scanner I only have 2 options- container build & asset handler I think? - which is 4 cart wrangler). Ive done Cart wrangler only once and& walked 20k steps in a 4 hr sort lol. There was a nice AA that gave me tips but also seemed annoyed that I didn't wanna walk to the front to get coffee that I said I rly needed -because it was outside of our 15min break (that we all take @ the same time) & stated I'm not being labor tracked so take advantage (is this true?). Also in the 1st 2 wks I did container build in non con twice, 1 time cart wrangler & then the rest of the shifts I was in container build shoe sortation.
The 3rd wk I was put into the chutes/container build direct. When I went to scan in at that area for the 1st time, I recognized the PA as they were the PA from the 1st time I did non con. This PA I've only seen in the chutes since then so I think she was filling in at non con then.

So now these last 2 weeks: I've only been in the chutes or shoe sortation & I seem to be seeing the same PAs for the most part. Also I've worked more& picked up some shifts these last 2 wks. & I've talked to others from my training class & these last 2 wks we all seem to be getting a mixed bag but makes sense to me as to possibly why.

Also I've noticed the communication I've received from the PAs is all over the place. When asked why is my scanner doing this or that (assigning me to a lane w/no boxes to load but blue light is on for ex.) the PAs in the chutes say things like oh the system automatically does that. 🤔

The PAs in shoe sortation appear a little more transparent & say that they don't normally use the scanners to communicate and to pick a lane & they'll reassign u if needed.

Also PAs have a style. like the morning PAs seem more chill but I don't really like it in the chutes because I'm getting my scanner going off to go to lane 21 row 15 when I just finished loading a go cart& clearing a chute (swear they got a camera on me lol) & now I'm assigned to lane 1 @ the other end which is fine but other AAs seem to pick a lane/row & stay there. Even the girl from my training class said she rarely gets assigned new chutes except for maybe once or twice during the sort... I think i was reassigned like 10 times?! maybe more maybe less , I dunno but my scanner was going off a lot lol. It does make the shift go by fast though, i like that. And it's also annoying when there's an empty cart/pallet in front of a chute but the waterspider hasn't electronically ""opened""it on their end. Or cuz some AAs do this when they appear to claim a chute & aren't a waterspider for that day but want to claim the area or whatever 🙄

Now feedback from management:

From what I've read when I searched a bit on here- I'll receive communication from PAs when I'm doing well. So I'm maybe I'm not doing as good as i think? I do leave @4hrs sometimes or clock out early for a longer break when feet are really bad

I'm friendly/make small talk when I scan in w/the PA for that area & state that I'm new/anything to pay attention to etc? Same response- pick a lane or look out for areas w/blue lights.
Observations - the aforementioned PA from my 1st  non con shift doesn't say much but does seem to micro manage everyone via scanners it appears (non con & chutes). My 1st non con day I was chatting w/2 others. None of us had much to scan in. 2 of us were staying busy by opening up carts /closing the bottom half... The girl that was talking but not really doing anything else was reassigned to a completely different area within like 5 minutes during this interaction, it was the beginning of the shift too just fyi. Throughout that shift me & the other girl talked but worked hard the whole time. Towards the end of the shift I kept taking breaks to stretch my back/ankles or to drink water. The other girl said she felt nervous that we were going to get into trouble for talking/stopping too much. I stated that we had both loaded many things w/out the waterspiders/ guys (who were non existent until the end) & that I think it's fine because it seemed like we were just as productive as 3 AAs just by watching the other ppl on our row. That PA did come over right after this convo & said that we could work together but asked us to move to the other side & help the blue light lanes (this was the 1st time I learned of the blue lights)

Now in shoe sortation I'm very confused as of this last wk (Sunday actually) by the interaction.

The shoe sortation PAs, there's 2 PAs i see a lot (let's call these PAs in shoe sortation & that I've seen the most PA Paul &PA Carla- PA Carla I've seen in the chutes as PA too, don't have much to say about her, she's kinda just there i think but does help out some kinda?) & i think there's 1 that I thought was a PA but i think he's an AM.. this AM is on his laptop alot but ALL over the place. Actually all the PAs/AMs scoot around 24-7 on their mobile laptop desk thingys. Also on my 1st shift working w/PA Paul i asked him what to do/not do & it was basically pick a lane & hang out until it picks up (it was a rare slow shift & in the Morn.).

My 3rd or 4th shift w/PA Paul (which r now all evening shifts in shoe sort lately) & I think my 1st shift with this AM. I ask the same ? since evening shift seemed to do things different & the AM says just help out where needed/pick a lane or look for blue lights. I say ok. Also- AM seems nice& approachable :) so ya, Its the end of the 1st hr of shift & I've banged it out in this 1 lane w/just 1 other AA (other lanes mostly had 3 or 4 AAs).. The AM comes over & says hey I know I said pick wherever but can you keep doing exactly what you're doing but over in this lane? AM Takes me to that lane that is a cluster f. I work my butt off the rest of the shift but again the shift goes by fast.  Also that was the previous Sunday & many higher up leaders that we met in training were in the lanes & doing stuff too. Even the safety ops director came into my lane to help clear it & then gave me a tip about the skinny boxes & laughed at my joke while we worked. He seemed annoyed tho but i don't think anything to do w/me.
-also Every hr in shoe sortation (sometimes more) I walk over to the side & get a drink/stretch or both for maybe 1-3 minutes tops, but ya, it really helps, cuz again, I'm running on all cylinders (i finally don't feel guilty for not working out lately! & getting $!) -Also during this shift was the 1st time I noticed ppl upstairs. & 100% felt that watched feeling lol & glanced up when working & yep.

So no one has said anything to me during shifts, I've done a handful of them & this last week, saw PA Paul getting onto many AAs, mainly the ones standing & chatting. I chat with coworkers on these shifts & some shifts I'm not chatting at all because I don't know the person etc.

This last Sunday is PA Paul, PA Carla, & the same AM. It's getting close to break time, about 2.5 hours into the sort. I'm chatting with a fellow coworker after we just cleared the lane. Actually it looks like the slowest it's been all wk for evening shift & there appears to be only 2 maybe 3 lanes that were backed up.
I'm stretching while talking to my fellow coworker (who is also a very hard worker from my training class).. this was probably the longest I've stayed in an empty lane before moving around, maybe 5 min TOPS. usually i move within seconds. When I'm in the runout lanes (that's what they call them not shoe sortation ) or the chutes for direct build, I take more breaks than most for both, but I also work harder/faster & more efficient than most imo. But it's usually short spurts, taken  in front of PAs whoever, just trying to start a sustainable process on my body in this new role.
Now back to this last Sunday- PA Paul comes over & says we need to move lanes & that we shouldn't just be standing & talking & that it looks bad because the site supervisor is on property & watching. I was stunned. I'm all for operational/workplace confrontation but this felt like chaos/not fitting of the situation. Appreciate any insight esp on this*

PA Paul is also seen running all over the place this day & more than normal. Also I was very frustrated & upset by this otherwise why am I making this post? Well I was wanting to make 1 with some aforementioned stuff from prev wks but Sunday = do it. & I'm thrown because I was stretching but yes in an empty lane & talking. It took everything in me to not state that I do not change my work ethics or character based on ""who's looking"" & would easily make adjustments based on company wide, equally enforced policy.

Also any help me w/ terminology pls!
& what about rate? Only heard it mentioned once by an AA bragging in non con that his rate is always at 100 or above. But then again I can NEVER hear what's being said on the overhead & only occasionally at stand up depending on who's doing it. My rate is almost always high I think?

I've searched this group but everyone uses Amazon terminology so I'm clueless to what I'm reading lol.

Also  of note: I have another friend that works at a different location & is new. I think the location I work at does seem to care about the employees (I see AA complaints on the myvoice app) &then a few days later AAs thanking management for fixing said issues or management implementation of changes from an AAs good idea. Now not all complaints/issues but many esp regarding safety or inclusion or just really good ideas.
Thanks to whoever made it through my novel! Much appreciation 🩷

1pitk4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1pitk4l/scared_of_brain_fog/,Scared of brain fog,"Reading this sub had made me absolutely terrified to quit. I don’t drink caffeine because I enjoy it, I drink it because I fear making mistakes at work or not getting chores done at home. I fear forgetting to pay my rent, not passing the tests I need to take to be considered for a program that may allow me to get a new and better job. But I can’t do this anymore. I wish I had never read this sub at this point, because it has prevented me from what could’ve been an easy quit if I just said “y’know, I’m not having any coffee tomorrow”, and been done with it. Now, I’m not just a bit anxious from caffeine or keyed up sometimes, I’m hyper aware of how caffeine is affecting me which is probably causing placebo anxiety that isn’t even from the caffeine, feeling guilty when I drink it, doubting myself when I don’t, feeling worried whether I do or don’t drink caffeine. I genuinely feel like I need to give up this career opportunity. I have been working at my job store since 2022, and I find it would be a good and forgiving place to learn and adapt to life without caffeine, but because I will be starting this new program potentially in February + the onboarding process going on now, I feel trapped and like I’m stuck in a whirlwind of anxiety and feel like I’ve ruined my life path because I have to choose between this new opportunity or quitting caffeine. Perhaps I could defer the opportunity, but then I might just start consuming caffeine again and relapse and then maybe I’d have to defer again and back to square one. Is it possible for me to pursue this vocational program AND quit caffeine? Has anyone actually quit and not had brain fog for months on end?

I am not only discouraged about quitting caffeine but frankly just angry at myself for having consumed it as my lifeblood as an anorexic for years on end. I’m recovered now, but I’m sick of being reliant on a drug, and annoyed that nobody else seems to care or see how it effects them. I’m angry that without it I feel inhibited, so I’m forced to live tentatively stepping not knowing if I’m building a life that is sustainable for me if I quit.

I initially turned to this sub for support, but I’ve been obsessing over quitting caffeine yet never actually quitting for 2 years now and it’s turned into a legitimate pathology where I believe that my OCD has latched onto it as an obssssion and I don’t know what to do. I wish I could just stop drinking it, but it feels like plunging into the unknown. Every single day lately in my life has been this free falling feeling, and I just want a few months of stable comfort knowing I can quit, but I also don’t want to give up a chance to get out of retail and into a new job I might find more meaningful, as I have been similarly sitting on the fence about doing this program or going back to school for years as well.

1pitiv0,https://i.redd.it/v7qqi60a2b6g1.png,Why You’re Always Tired (and How to Fix It Naturally),"If you wake up tired, drag through the day, and crash every evening wondering why you have no energy left—this isn’t normal. It’s not just “getting older,” “being busy,” or “needing more coffee.” Chronic fatigue is the silent epidemic of modern life, and it’s time we stop accepting it as part of success.

Most people try to fix exhaustion by treating the symptom instead of the cause. They drink more caffeine, sleep in on weekends, or take energy supplements that only mask what’s really going on. But your body isn’t running out of willpower—it’s running out of balance.

The real reasons behind low energy are almost always biological. Poor sleep quality, nutrient deficiencies, dehydration, chronic stress, and unstable blood sugar all drain your energy reserves long before you realize it. The modern lifestyle—endless screens, late nights, skipped meals, and constant pressure—creates the perfect storm for fatigue. You’re not lazy. You’re running on an empty system.

Let’s start with the basics. Your energy comes from mitochondria—the tiny engines inside your cells. When they’re undernourished or overloaded with stress, your body slows down to protect itself. That’s why eating processed food, skipping meals, or surviving on caffeine leads to crashes instead of clarity. You’re forcing the system without ever refueling it.

Natural energy restoration isn’t about hacks—it’s about alignment. The human body is wired for rhythm: sunlight in the morning, nourishment throughout the day, and deep recovery at night. The moment you fight that rhythm, fatigue becomes inevitable.

Eat real food—foods that actually contain energy, not just calories. Think proteins that rebuild, fats that sustain, and complex carbs that stabilize your blood sugar instead of spiking it. Hydrate like it matters, because it does. Even mild dehydration can cut your focus and productivity in half. And if you want real rest, respect your sleep routine like you respect a business meeting—because your body repairs itself when you let it.

But the most overlooked energy killer? Mental fatigue. When your brain never stops working, your body never gets to recharge. Constant multitasking, stress, and digital noise drain your energy as effectively as skipping meals. That’s why stillness is now a performance strategy, not a luxury.

If you want to stop feeling tired all the time, stop chasing energy from outside sources. Build it from within. Eat with purpose. Move daily. Disconnect often. Sleep deeply. Your body doesn’t need another stimulant—it needs restoration.

Because true energy isn’t something you buy, it’s something you build.

Like, genuinely different. Not in a ""hey we added a new button"" way, but in a ""the entire game has changed"" way.

I wanted to share what I'm seeing on the ground because a lot of business owners (especially smaller ecommerce shops) are missing these shifts, and it's costing them sales. Not because their products suck, but because their CX is stuck in 2019.

  
**TL;DR:** Customer experience in 2025 is about personalization, speed, [omnichannel](https://www.kommunicate.io/omnichannel-messaging/) consistency, smart AI use, and keeping the human touch alive. Implement even 2-3 of these well and you'll see real results. Ignore them and you'll keep losing sales to competitors who ""just get it.""

# Why This Actually Matters Now

Look, I get it. Everyone talks about customer experience. But here's the reality check: 86% of people will literally pay MORE money for a better experience ([PwC data](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/business-transformation/library/2025-customer-experience-survey.html)). I've seen this firsthand - customers will abandon a cheaper competitor to buy from someone who just... gets it right.

Think about it. When's the last time you personally stuck with a clunky website when Amazon was right there?

# Here's What's Actually Working in 2025:

# 1. Personalization (But Not Creepy Personalization)

Remember when ""personalization"" meant slapping someone's first name in an email? Yeah, we're way past that.

Today's customers expect you to remember what they bought, what they looked at, and what they might actually want - without being weird about it. It's like when your favorite local shop owner remembers you like your coffee with less sugar. That feeling? That's what people want online.

The tech to do this exists. AI recommendation engines, smart segmentation - it's all accessible even for smaller stores. But most people aren't using it because they think it's complicated. It's not.

**Pro tip:** Start simple. Even a ""welcome back"" message with relevant product suggestions makes a huge difference.

# 2. Speed Isn't Optional Anymore

This one's brutal but true: 53% of mobile users bounce if your site takes more than 3 seconds to load (Google data). THREE SECONDS.

And checkout? If it feels like filling out a mortgage application, you've already lost them. 70% of shopping carts get abandoned because checkout is too damn complicated (Baymard Institute).

I've seen stores literally double their conversion rate just by streamlining checkout to one page and allowing guest purchases. No account creation, no 47 form fields. Just: name, address, payment, done.

# 3. Omnichannel Is the Baseline Now

Your customers aren't shopping in one place anymore. They're browsing on Instagram at lunch, checking reviews on their phone at night, and maybe completing the purchase on desktop the next day.

They expect everything to be synced. Cart items, wishlist, customer service conversations - all of it. If they message you on Instagram asking about shipping, and then you tell them something different on your website... trust gone.

# 4. AI + Humans (Not AI vs Humans)

AI chatbots are getting scary good. By 2025, they're handling 95% of basic customer interactions (Servion data). But here's the thing people get wrong: AI should handle the repetitive stuff so humans can focus on the complex, emotional stuff.

""Where's my order?"" → Bot handles instantly with tracking link  
""This product broke and I'm really frustrated"" → Human takes over

The companies doing this right are cutting costs by 30% while IMPROVING customer satisfaction. That's the sweet spot.

# 5. Voice Commerce Is Here (Whether You're Ready or Not)

Voice shopping is hitting $164 billion globally in 2025. That's not a typo.

But here's what most people miss: if your product descriptions are written for SEO robots, voice assistants won't understand them. You need to write how people actually talk.

Instead of ""Model 1245X Performance Athletic Footwear"" try ""comfortable running shoes for men."" Voice search queries are conversational.

# 6. Delivery Transparency > Fast Delivery

Everyone obsesses over ""same day delivery!"" but here's what I've learned: customers mostly just want to KNOW when their stuff is coming and TRUST that you're telling the truth.

62% expect free shipping within 3 days (Deloitte), sure. But 90% actively track their packages. They want updates. Real-time tracking via SMS or WhatsApp beats promising 2-day shipping and missing it.

Be honest about timelines. A late delivery doesn't just lose one sale - it loses future trust.

# 7. Privacy Isn't Just Legal Compliance

Data breaches are everywhere. Customers are paranoid, and rightfully so. 79% will stick with brands they trust with their data (Salesforce).

This means:

* Clear, readable privacy policies (not 50 pages of legal jargon)
* Secure payment gateways (not sketchy looking checkout pages)
* Not spamming their phone number you collected

Trust is earned slowly and lost instantly.

# 8. Community > Transactions

The brands winning right now aren't just selling products. They're building communities.

Starbucks doesn't sell coffee - they sell ""a third place between home and work.""  
Nike doesn't sell shoes - they sell ""just do it"" lifestyle.

You can do this at any scale. Instagram communities, Facebook groups, user-generated content - 79% of people say seeing other customers' photos influences their buying decisions (Stackla).

# 9. Sustainability Actually Matters Now

Gen Z and younger millennials will literally choose a more expensive product if it's sustainable. 77% prefer businesses committed to sustainability (IBM).

But here's the catch: they can smell BS from a mile away. ""Greenwashing"" (fake eco-friendly claims) will destroy your credibility. Show real action with eco-friendly packaging, recyclable options, actual supply chain transparency.

# 10. The Human Touch Still Wins

In a world of AI and automation, the human moments hit different.

I've seen this work:

* Handwritten thank you notes in packages
* Personal follow-up emails asking how the product worked out
* Actual empathy when things go wrong

Technology brings speed. Humans bring emotion and trust. You need both.

# 11. Subscriptions & Loyalty Programs Are Exploding

75% of consumers prefer brands with rewards programs (Accenture). And I'm not talking complicated point systems that require a PhD to understand.

Simple examples:

* Coffee/tea monthly subscriptions
* Points for purchases that actually convert to real discounts
* VIP early access to new products

Repeat customers are worth 10x more than one-time buyers. Build systems that encourage them to come back.

# 12. The Tech Side (Important If You're on Shopify)

If you're running an ecommerce store (especially on Shopify), implementing these trends requires actual development work. I'm talking:

* Speed optimization (every millisecond counts)
* Custom checkout flows
* [AI/chatbot integration](https://www.kommunicate.io/)
* Analytics setup for personalization

You can't just install a theme and hope for the best anymore. The stores crushing it in 2025 have invested in proper development that makes all this stuff actually work.

# The Bottom Line

Look, I've been doing this for 25 years. I've seen a lot of trends come and go. But this isn't a trend - it's a fundamental shift in expectations.

Customers in 2025 expect:

* Speed
* Personalization
* Consistency across platforms
* Privacy protection
* Real human connection when it matters
* Transparency
* Community

You don't need to implement everything overnight. Pick 2-3 of these and actually do them well. That's already ahead of 80% of your competition.

The stores that figure this out? They're not just surviving - they're thriving. The ones that ignore it? They're wondering why their traffic is up but sales are flat.

We don't really know each other well, we have never worked directly with each other but we always say hi and sometimes make small talk when we are around each other. 

I think he is super cute and sweet! We have given each other random compliments, one time he came up to me just to tell me we were matching (granted we wear a uniform lol but we were also wearing the same color sweater coincidentally) 

He has also helped me a couple times recently with random things that I can't really explain here, it was little stuff but I appreciated it. 

He's just a nice guy though, so I don't really know how to take any of these interactions? I also don't know him well enough to know if he's in a relationship. I think I catch him looking at me sometimes but also I accidentally look at him a lot so I'm worried I'm just being a weirdo and he's wondering wtf is wrong with me lol 

I have been thinking about if I am ever in a situation where I run into him in the parking lot or something, I might ask him if he wants to get a drink or coffee with me. I can't ask him while we are on the clock because of the nature of my job. Most of the people that work here are in college or just out of college, it's definitely not unheard of for coworkers here to date but they just have to be careful for privacy reasons if that makes sense. Also people come & go a lot, this is a starting point for many people including myself. 

So it feels like not a super big deal if I end up doing that, but I'm anxious and scared of rejection lol. If we  worked in the same department I wouldn't even consider it but even though we don't, we do run into each other a lot. ",2,1765340572.0,twentyagers,9,1.0,False

**Terminal Fleet, Chapter 2: Unending Nights**

The club is dark, humid and stained with the sweat of crammed, dance-twisting bodies, the bass so deep that it squeezes Lanis’ heart.

Day three, is it? What week? What does it matter? The numbing trance of the dance floor is her home, though occasionally she’s forced to leave to shoot back a drink or a protein packet, lingering in the clubs’ dark bathrooms just long enough to find a Fleet-strengthened vein or inhale some illicit substance. Anything that will help muffle her pain.

Sometimes, rarely, there are a few hours of horrible, necessary sleep. When she wakes it’s often in a tangle with some model-thin stranger with barely reactive pupils, which she dutifully checks. She leaves their bodies to their valiant metabolization of alcohol and drugs, slipping from sweat-stained sheets and into her dingy hotel’s communal showers. Thirty seconds of blasting cold water, all that she can afford given her meager Fleet discharge stipend, a quick change, the stranger gently or forcibly dragged from her room, and then she’s out into the city’s underbelly again.

Lanis doesn’t truly need the drugs to keep going; at least not the uppers. Which hasn’t stopped her from taking anything she can get her quick hands on. It’s not just a matter of her youth, or having the physical conditioning of a professional athlete: plenty of people in this city’s club scene are the same, and they still can’t match her. It’s the stamina that Fleet demanded, and the modifications that they implanted, that allow her to keep her going, night after night.

If only they could see how she’s using them now.

Still, even Lanis gets tired. And on this, her third day without sleep, if she’s being slightly honest with herself (an effort that she’d quite like to avoid), she might finally be running on fumes.

But that would mean sleep.

*Ugh*, *no*, she thinks. She bounces and pivots, staring at the gritty club’s ceiling with bloodshot eyes, and pushes the thought of sleep right back into the hole where it belongs. Time for another drink, that’s all. Maybe a stim. Anyway, it’s only two in the morning. The line outside is still growing longer in the drizzling neon rain, and the crowd inside is just now starting to become well and truly messed up.

She dances and stumbles through the sea of bodies to her beacon, the long fluorescent expanse of the club’s main bar. *Hey*! she mimes, pushing her body up into a position that, with the outfit she’s wearing, snug and black, usually gets a quicker response, even from the normally temptation-numbed bartenders.

She had never been to a club before two months ago, but if there’s one thing that can be said, as indisputably proven by Fleet command-track examinations, it’s that she’s a fast learner.

Her tactic works, the only price being the annoyed exasperation of the other clubbers. A little yelling, a little miming, a lip-biting wink, and she gets two shots of clear liquid that are near tasteless going down, though maybe that’s more due to her overwrought nerves than the alcohol. She closes her eyes and feels a dull warmth spread throughout her body.

*Ok. I'm ok.*

They snap open to a hoarse yelling in her ear.

“Hey I like your—"" the words are cut off by a growing surge in the music and a cheer from the crowd. Lanis turns to meet the eyes of another grinning wannabe model (do they let in any others here?), tall, earlobes full of crystals, eyes milky white with retinal implants. She’s already becoming bored with the type, the avant-garde young and the maybe rich and the searching-for-muses, but she’s feeling oddly generous after the two drinks, and she manages a half-hearted grin.

Of course, that encourages him, and he leans in, tall broad shoulders stooping down a bit. “Can I buy you a drink?” he asks, and “Why not?” she answers, because she could use a bit more time and alcohol until she gets back out there.

 

They retreat to a sound-dampened corner where a dozen others take inebriated respites among low couches, their voices heard with mild yelling instead of the hoarse roars needed elsewhere in the club. A ceiling funnel-fan gently wafts up the groups’ chain smoking, the light filtering through the haze like a sunset through lagoon water.

The stranger introduces himself, talking quickly, smiling frequently, as Lanis sips her drink. He points to his eyes: he’s been doing some modeling for the new Vennici III Iris models by Howett Corp, which are fully amazing, he says, so he’s getting this pair left in; not that they usually do that, but his aunt is a VP at the corp, so an exception has been made. Variable wavelength scanning, fully adjustable color, dilations on command—he begins to rattle off the technical specs before awkwardly stopping, in the way high people occasionally do, struck by a sudden bout of self reflection, and compliments her again.

“But the best part is, they let me appreciate how beautiful you are,"" he says, giving her a self-satisfied grin, all perfect teeth that glow purple in the club’s light. He brushes a hand, as if by accident, against Lanis’ exposed knee. ""And your work… It's gorgeous. Is it functional? Where did you have it done? Not Howett… Lingji Keji?”

Lanis has come to a hazy recognition, between her capacity to find sleeping partners and ability to skip club queues, that she might be vaguely attractive. It's not something that mattered at Fleet Academy. There, one’s worth was measured in mental stamina and AI integration scores.

In this case, however, he’s talking specifically about her head. It is, she admits, fairly striking. *If only he could see me bald, like I was before*, she thinks. Her hair’s grown in over the three months since she was expelled from Fleet, but the silver and gold interface still noticeably spills up from beneath the clinging black fabric at the back of her neck. It fans out from the base of her skull at the cervicomedullary junction, running beneath the occipital ridge to bloom at her temples.

“Fleet service,” Lanis says. She watches, curious, as the model’s perfect, wide smile falters, confused, and then spreads wider.

“Hah! Ok, but seriously. It's super cool. So, just decorative then?”

“Well, I suppose not as functional as it used to be, but definitely not decorative. I’m serious, you know. I was de-listed about... I don't know, a couple months back.” She lifts her chin in a challenge. “You can look if you like: neural shunt is still intact."" She taps a flat little emerald-looking jewel on her temple which slides open to reveal a metallic implant node. The model leans in, milky eyes narrowing. Lanis flits her eyes and the node retracts. ""A little fried now, but...” she trails off, scanning into the crowded darkness. She laughs instead of finishing, a high pitched titter with a manic edge to it.

“Whoa,” the eye model breathes, looking concerned and taken aback, his pupils dilating rapidly. “I like, almost don’t know if you’re joking now.”

Lanis shrugs.

“I’m not, but whatever. Look, I’m not going to fuck you, but if you want to dance I’m headed back out. Thanks for the drink,” Lanis says, patting the man on the shoulder. The eye-model grins lopsidedly, bafflement almost overridden by disappointment.

They end up dancing together for a while, the model gamely trying to change Lanis’ mind in regard to spending the night together. She even lets him make out with her for a while, lets him slide his hands over her muscle-taut body and tell her how beautiful she is. It's a bit nice to be touched, but she keeps laughing when he does it, in on some joke that he's not privy to, and eventually he drifts back off to the bar, ready to try his luck with someone who isn’t going to tease him with a bunch of nonsense about Fleet. Lanis smirks when he goes. She loses herself again in the beat, feet bouncing, eyes closed, anesthetizing her thoughts.

Another hour. Two. Three. The club will run for seventy-two hours straight, and Lanis’ intermission with the eye model marked hour thirty-five of her current long night. Her hyper-conditioned body has already long outlasted the original occupants of the dance floor, but at hour thirty-eight it needs another break. She realizes with annoyance that she’s hungry. *When did I last eat?* she wonders. *Alcohol has sugar. Do I actually ever need to eat again?* Her body groans in protest, and Lanis sighs.

She pushes through the crowd again, studiously avoiding any eye contact that could be mistaken as encouragement. Still, a hand makes a half-hearted pull at her waist, and she twists it in a shockingly firm grip, the owner gasping in pain as she walks away, aiming for the red-lit stairs at the back.

Three flights up, past couples or trios drinking or intertwined, and then onto the club’s covered rooftop, the city’s glowing towers rising around her like ancient obelisks of power. A heady rush of cool air greets her, and Lanis takes a deep pre-dawn breath, her body steaming like a furnace. There are fewer people here, hanging in clumps and clusters of form-fitting lovers and tattooed smokers. Sunrise is two hours away, and the rain is still coming down, soft and sweet, pattering on the industrial metal overhang.

She walks carefully, swaying only slightly, to a long row of bright-blinking vending machines. Some serve full hot meals, or coffee, or steamed pork buns, or changes of pre-worn schoolgirl underwear, but she’s only interested in the utilitarian Murkata-Heisin Corp branded protein-gel packets. Murkata-Heisin, makers of industrial heavy machinery, AI security logistics, DJ implants, and protein gel-pack vending machines.

*Maybe I can get a job with them*, Lanis thinks idly, as she punches in an order on the old machine. Not likely though, not with what Fleet has put on her record, even within a vending machine division. *Especially* at a megacorp like Murkata. Pushing the thought away, she tears open the packet and squeezes orange-flavored liquid protein into her mouth. *Damn that’s good*. She punches in an order for a second, then a third.

“You *are* ex-Fleet, aren’t you?” a woman’s voice says from behind her.

Lanis turns, the third gel pack dangling from her mouth. The woman who spoke leans against another vending machine, the one selling pre-worn underwear, her face illuminated by its pixelated animations. She has a stronger face than Lanis’ elfen one, a bit older and a bit less model-like than most of the others here, which Lanis finds immediately appealing. Her curly hair is discerningly disheveled, tousled in just the right way to show up the highlights of layered bright blue. And *God*, what is she wearing? Her outfit is outrageous even by the standards of the club, as if a business suit had been ripped apart by a pack of art-school wolves, who then raggedly replaced some of the tatters with transparent, glowing plastic. It accentuates the woman’s curves in a way that Lanis finds distressing.

“That is *quite* an outfit,” Lanis says, blinking and smiling oddly, unable to help herself.

“It’s bespoke. Very expensive.” The woman flashes a grin, then cocks her head. “Sorry for eavesdropping earlier. Well, no, I actually love eavesdropping, but some people find it rude.” She holds out a hand. “I’m Mirem.”

Lanis shakes her hand softly, her other hand still holding the third gel pack. “A pleasure, Mirem. I’m Lanis. And yes, I am. Ex-Fleet, that is. Had a bit of an incident though.” She winces, over-comically. “Turns out Fleet doesn't care much for non-functional parts. But I guess, who does?""

A moment of silence passes between them, rain echoing on the overhang, dull bass and laughter in the distance.

“Well, I’d say that we’re all a bit broken, in one way or another,” Mirem says slowly. She pauses, her face unreadable. ""But it’s a bit unusual for Fleet to discharge people Terra-side, isn’t it?""

Lanis runs a hand through her short hair, feeling the coolness of the implants. She shudders. Maybe it’s just the cold. ""I wouldn’t blame you for not believing me. It's funny, you know? Fleet told me not to go around advertising it. But I found that it doesn't really matter, because no one believes me. Not that I mind.""

""Well, can you really blame people? That would make you... how do I say this? Quite unique,” Mirem says, smiling.

Lanis holds up a hand, pensively ticking off the statistics: ""Right, so if Terra has about twenty billion… then I'd be about one in five million, if you were just going by my cohort.” She purses her lips, and raises her eyes to the obscured sky before meeting Mirem's eyes again. ""Very roughly, of course. Could be more or less though, depending on what service track I went into.""

She can see that Mirem doesn't really know what to make of her, but also that she hides it well. Some sort of training? Or maybe just practice.

""Well, at minimum I would *love* to buy you a drink. And, if you find yourself available, I have a proposition. Contact sent,” Mirem says.

A subtle blink tugs at the periphery of Lanis’ vision. She accepts the packet, gives it a scan.

“Versk Energy Corp. And you’re a… talent agent?” Lanis says, her brow furrowed.

The smile that has been tugging at the corner of Mirem’s mouth turns into a laugh.

“I guess you could put it like that. I’m a liaison between their engineering teams and various pilot associations, mainly pre corp-sponsorship in the second and third Arena tiers, but also some independent security outfits. We’ve had a few ex-Service member pilots, but I don’t think there’s ever been anyone from Fleet before. Could be *fascinating*.” Mirem readjusts herself, crossing her arms across her chest; it pushes her body out of her outfit in new, unexpected ways.

Lanis has only the vaguest notion of what the Arena entails. She had no interest in the games when she was younger, and Fleet training didn’t exactly leave much time for extracurriculars.

Whatever. It doesn’t really matter if she doesn’t know what Mirem is talking about, because her current rule of thumb, in willful opposition to the past eight years of her life, is that nothing really matters. However, an exception seems to be standing right in front of her. Mirem, Lanis has decided with an odd lurch to her heart, is stunningly beautiful.

Lanis holds Mirem’s gaze as she brings her gel packet to her mouth and squeezes it onto her tongue. She swallows, feeling the gummy, nutrient-rich acidity slide down her throat. Fleet training hammered in certain instincts. One is that boldness is rewarded more often than not.

“I’d be open to a pitch, if you came back to mine,” Lanis says, trying to project the old swagger of a command-track Fleet cadet.

Mirem laughs again, but it’s not unkind. She tilts her head, as if she’s considering it, brushing a strand of curly hair from her face. “You’re too drunk. Or high. I’d feel bad.”

Lanis sighs. She gestures to a Murkata-Heisin BAC reader sitting like an afterthought at the end of the vending machine row.

“Ok, my blood alcohol is a little high, I suppose, 0.12 by my reading. My Fleet implants, the ones they couldn't remove, include some high-end detox modules. So, if you’re really so concerned,” she rolls her eyes dramatically, “I’ll take it to .085. But not any less, I won’t let you be a total buzz kill. Give me ten seconds.”

She walks to the BAC reader and frowns as she initiates her body’s rarely-used detox protocols. She's done it before when someone tried to spike her drink, another time with a bad batch of injectables, but never with alcohol. *What a waste*.

She waits a few moments, then puts a finger into the BAC reader. A green 0.085 flashes across the screen. She watches Mirem's face as she does so, observing a subtle change, the idea that Lanis is lying about her ex-Fleet status diminishing. Her smile takes on a new meaning.

“Well, ok then,” Mirem says. “But not your place. You’re, what, only a few weeks out, from what I overheard? Just from looking at your outfit I bet you’re probably renting some crappy week-let. I wonder if it’s even been cleaned since you started on whatever little rampage you’re on.”

Lanis opens her mouth to defend herself — except that it’s all true — but Mirem waves her off and continues, a mischievous look playing on her face. “No. If you’re serious, then you’re coming back to my place.”

Lanis briefly considers the few, vague rules she had set out for herself two months earlier. Don’t take drugs from strangers. Don’t advertise that you’re ex-Fleet. Don’t go back to anyone else’s place. The first two rules have long since been broken, with increasing self-destructive recklessness.

I’ve been dreaming of opening a coffee shop since middle school, and over the past couple of years, I’ve been trying to narrow down my ideas. I’ve recently been thinking of Wilmington as a potential location, but I’d love to get some opinions from the public! 

My current idea is to open a more budget friendly cafe with a heavily themed atmosphere. I’ve always been a lover of D&D, Magic the Gathering, and various other tabletop games, so naturally I’m shooting towards a medieval tavern/wizard’s study theme. We’re looking to have mostly bakery items, no “meals,” and ofc everything would be themed. We’d have discounted gaming nights (think Friday Night Magic w 15% off drinks), board games that can be borrowed by sit-down customers, and nerdy trivia nights (Harry Potter, D&D, music, etc). While we would be themed, we would still sell quality coffee beverages, as I’ve worked as a barista my whole career and have a passion for it. Does this sound appealing to anyone?
