I’ve been having a problem with my espressos for almost 2 weeks now. No matter what I do, almost every shot tastes sour and undrinkable.

I first noticed the problem right after I last cleaned my grinder. After the cleaning, the espresso was great for about a week, but now I only get bad results.

My setup:
	•	La Marzocco Linea Mini R (93.5 °C)
	•	Prebrewing: 3 sec on, 2 sec off
	•	Mahlkönig X54 grinder
	•	17 g basket
	•	16.5 g dose of mid-roast beans
	•	Distribution tool & WDT tool
	•	Precision tamper
	•	Thin 0.5 mm puck screen for the La Marzocco screw

My recipe: 1:2.3 in 28 sec

Before this, I dialed in really well and my shots were perfect. Now, they’re consistently sour with a thin body.

I’ve tried:
	•	Extracting in 25 sec
	•	Extracting in 31 sec
	•	Extracting in almost 40 sec

…but the result is almost always the same: sour and thin.

The shots look okay in a bottomless portafilter – they drip normally at the start, then get a little watery at the end.

I’m wondering what I could be doing wrong. Could it be:
	•	The grinder?
	•	Something I did while cleaning it?
	•	The temperature on my Linea Mini R?
	•	My puck prep? (I haven’t changed anything there in 5 years)

I’d really appreciate your ideas!

Thanks a lot",1,1764418682.0,barista,0,1.0,False

Who: 2 adults travelling with our 5 year old. 5 year old loves water: pools, slides etc... but has since difficulties with lots of noise/crowds. Grandparents might join, one has mobility challenges. 

Fly out of: Ottawa YOW or Toronto YYZ

Budget: 8K or 13K respectively if it's the 3 or 5 of us. There can be some wiggle room.
We don't want to be nickel and dimed for upgrades etc... once there. If there is something necessary for us to get the most enjoyment it should be included. 

Where: some where warm! DR or Mexico seems best. Travel time less then 5 hours and direct flight at good hours. 

When: escaping winter in last week of Jan through March (like everyone else) 

Duration: 5 nights

Important to us:
1. Safety/health - don't expect to go off resort. We'll need shade.
2. Family fun centered around our daughter. Pools, water park, sand, other activities. Not a party/drunk location. 
3. Easy - don't want to be fighting for spots, waiting in long lines etc. just to ensure we 'enjoy' our time.
4. Kids club - wouldn't use everyday but likely a couple times. 
5. Food - decent taste and options. Like most people good food will improve our stay, awful food will ruin it. Daughter is picky but fine with the normal picky kids food... Pizza, chicken nuggets, grilled cheese. Easy to get ice cream. No one drinks coffee/teas. Not huge alcohol drinkers, but we'll have a couple. 
6. Room - quiet especially after 8pm and some privacy. Would strongly prefer a separate bedroom with door from living space so adults can exist after daughter is down. Two beds in one seperate bedroom would be ideal. Balcony or other to enjoy at this time too.
7. Some enjoyment for adults during kids club to relax or experience!

Our current short list: 
1. Paradisus Grand Cana  Family concierge suite
2. Paradisus  playa del carmen   Family concierge suite
3. Majestics elegance or mirage (seems one bedroom options are only a single king) 
4. Oceans El Faro - rooftop or Master (single king only)

Appreciate any help narrowing it down further or an option/consideration we may have overlooked that would be better suited.

Thanks,

1p9nij1,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1p9nij1/handling_multiple_plot_lines_more_efficiently/,Handling multiple plot lines more efficiently.,"I'm an aspiring webcomic author, and instead of doing something more productive or at the very least working on my college application, I've been sitting here studying effective storytelling and character building over the past few months. Television, comics, graphic novels, literary fiction, you name it, I've been through it.



My WIP is an episodic comedy, so I've been paying a bit more attention to storytelling methods in sitcoms and comedy television. So yeah, I've come up with something, and I was thinking we could have a discussion about this.



Let's say we have a main ensemble consisting of seven people. Four of them is team Uppercase, three of them is team Lowercase. The ensemble shares a common ground, and in this case, they are housemates.



Team Uppercase shares another yet smaller common ground, which is that they are ex-friends (the fallout was brutal) and that they are forced into a certain unfamiliar situation. Team Lowercase are coworkers, and they're at least partially responsible for forcing team Uppercase into said situation, which creates the first layer of conflict.



There are three plot lines: the A plot, the B plot, and the C plot.



The A plot is the overarching plot, sort of the 'backbone' that holds all of the characters together and gives context to everything that happens within the story. It doesn't get resolved until the very end.



The B plot is all the episodic plots that concern team Uppercase. It's also the bigger, more significant plot line of each episode. It would also mostly be character driven and often times involve the introduction of new side characters. For example, let's say team Uppercase suddenly became the owner of a weird coffee shop. The owners from the older, 'OG' coffee shop next block might come over and try to stir things up. Little do they know, the coffee shop is actually a large portal, and a good portion of the customers are monsters from another dimension. After the plot got resolved, they could still appear on other episodes or establish themselves as recurring characters/ running bits. And so on, and so forth.



The C plot is all the episodic plots that concern team Lowercase. It's less important and often recurring. For example, at the start of each episode, team Lowercase would do a routine visit to team Uppercase's coffee shop and throw them a new piece of information/ conflict. Team Lowercase would be dealing with their own problems as well, but it moreso exists as a temporary relief/ change of scene from the B plot.



It's not perfect, I know. And it probably doesn't make that much sense either. If you have any thoughts on this, or your own takes on how to efficiently handle multiple plot points, leave em here. Thanks.",0,1764418448.0,writing,0,0.5,False

I’m 22M from Spain. I’m introverted in real life, practical and mostly logical, and I tend to be reflective. Most of the time I’m friendly and polite. I sometimes joke or act a bit dumb on purpose cause it's fun. I study computer science and AI. I speak Spanish and English. I also don't have any social media besides YouTube (if you can even consider it that), and reddit. 

I don't have many hobbies, mainly watching YouTube videos or movies, reading stuff sometimes, playing video games sometimes, and studying while listening to chill music and maybe having a cup of coffee or tea.

 I try to reply when I can, but sometimes I get busy with Uni or life stuff.

I’m looking for someone I can talk to regularly, by text or voice. I like deep conversations but I also enjoy small everyday stuff. I prefer people who put effort into conversations, someone who checks in now and then, asks how things are, or brings up random small topics. I’d like someone in a similar situation who wants a steady friend to talk about anything. It would be a plus if our tastes in movies, series or music line up, but it’s not essential.

If this sounds like you, send a message or reply here.

Hey Bangalore fam! 👋

I'm making the classic Delhi → Bangalore migration and yes, I know flat hunting here is legendary for all the wrong reasons. 😅

**About me:**

* IIT graduate currently building my startup
* Clean, responsible tenant who respects shared spaces
* WFH friendly (won't blast music during your meetings!)
* Can discuss everything from tech to filter coffee preferences

**What I'm looking for:**

* A room in a shared flat (sublet/temporary also works!)
* Preferred areas: Koramangala, Indiranagar, Domlur
* Flexible on duration: few days to few months
* Open to other areas too – let's chat!

**What's in it for you:**

* Reliable rent payment (startup life hasn't made me broke... yet 😄)
* Potential roommate who won't eat your labeled food
* Happy to split utility costs fairly
* If you're in tech/startup space, always down for brainstorming sessions over chai
* References available on request

Even if you don't have a room but know someone who does, a quick DM or tag would mean the world. The Bangalore housing gods have been tough, but I'm optimistic!

Drop a comment or DM if you can help or know someone who can. Let's make this transition smoother than my last debugging session! 🚀",1,1764418312.0,bangalorerentals,0,1.0,False

As you see from the title I have a type, but unfortunately there aren’t many of you - and it doesn’t really happen to meet you irl, hence I’m here; I don’t have high expectations but there’s no harm in trying.
If you see yourself in the description and live in London, I’d be happy if you carry on reading.
About me:
5’ 4, slim/athletic build, longish dark red hair, brown eyes, fair skin, young looking - according to people.
Straight and (ideally) looking for a long term relationship if we’re compatible.
I’m childfree by choice for life - I adore dogs though!
I love keeping fit and being healthy: hiking and kayaking are 2 of my favourite outdoor activities.
I also like cozy time at home reading, watching a film with a plot (especially crime stories) or having a nice meal.
Teetotal, non-smoker and drug free from birth.
Coffee lover.
70s/80s rock/hard rock music is another passion of mine.
I’m into vintage clothes and my fashion style is inspired by the 70s aesthetics.
I have an active job which I love.
I’m a bit of an introvert and value my independence; I’m also quite straightforward and don’t beat around the bush.
Oh and last but not least: I’m a simple, happy person who enjoys the little things in life.
About you:
Fitting the description in the title and living in London.
Taller than me - it doesn’t take much!
Straight and monogamous, putting effort in building a relationship without giving up at the first disagreement (and I’ll do the same).
Simple and down to earth, someone I can discuss things with and who’s not ashamed of having a personality.
Age wise, I prefer someone in their 30s but I’m not really fussy about it, as long as you’re mature enough, sporty and look after yourself; late 20s and early 40s will do too.
You share some of my values: drug free, non smoker and child free are not negotiable, sorry; if you’re teetotal even better, but I don’t mind if you drink moderately.
Bonus points if you share my passion for travelling!
If most of the above resonates with you, why
not give it a go?!?
I look forward to hearing from you. x

1p9nao7,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1p9nao7/secured_our_wedding_date_within_the_same_month/,Secured our wedding date within the same month he's been a secret alcoholic,"Sorry if this is inconscise I haven't slept last night

Disclaimer: he has never has an alcohol problem before!

Yesterday I found my bottle of Baileys near empty whilst I'd only had 1 shot in my coffee a few weeks ago and not touched it since. I asked him about it and he said he's been drinking consistently for a month whilst I'm at work (which means hes been drinking on the job, he works from home). He said he's been going to the shop, getting lager or wine too, having in total 3-4 drinks a day, but not everyday. To make matters worse my car failed it's MOT and has been in the garage for 3 weeks, he's been drop me off and collecting me from work for 3 weeks whilst drinking during the day. He claims he would stop at 12 so that he had 4.5 hours to sober up before the drive, which is ridiculous I know

He's diagnosed with ADHD and has an addictive personality. At the start of our relationship he had an addiction to c*ke, which he sort help for and hasn't touched the stuff since. We've been together for 4 years. Outside of this he's never had any other problems with addiction

He's always struggled with mental health, so have I, so I understand how this has started. However what is baffling me is that he lied to me and kept it secret. All the while he was telling me that its OK if I need to go back to therapy (parental trauma, that I'm working through very well if I must say). To make matters worse he's lied to me whilst we were securing our wedding date, like we literally got a date for our wedding that we've been telling family about 2 weeks ago whilst he was actively lying to me

His mental health is the one thing he struggles to talk to me about. We are open and honest in all other aspects of life and I constantly praise our relationship for being so wonderful in every way! Aside from this. We've had one other insurance that he has lied to me about his mental health and it was a slippery slope

I'm going back to my parents house for a while as I'm unsure how to proceed. Any help would be so so appreciated. I'm really struggling",1,1764417713.0,alcoholism,1,1.0,False
1p9n9rn,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/1p9n9rn/please_help_me_decide_e14_gen_7_ill_vs_x1c_gen_13/,Please Help me Decide: E14 Gen 7 ILL vs X1C Gen 13 (vs maybe used X1C Gen 6),"Hello! I'm looking for buying advice on a ThinkPad. My budget is flexible; the weak yen is jacking up prices over here, but I can spend up to $3000ish worth in JPY (I'm in Japan) for the X1 Carbon Gen 13 (Aura Edition) if the reasoning is convincing enough for me.

Here are my ThinkPad's **Use Cases**. Both require Windows, not Linux, as explained below:

* **Light programming and Trading**: I mainly do VBA for making live trading spreadsheets, using the Excel API provided by the broker that is only available on Windows platforms. I might do some Python soon as well, but I won't be compiling huge projects. The Excel API is fairly heavy and occasionally puts Excel into a temporary halt, but this happens on my unlocked Alder Lake rig as well, so treat it as an unsolvable issue.
* **Translating**: Translating documents in Word (English <-> Japanese). I can't trust Linux (->LibreOffice) when my translation agency has specific indenting etc. guidelines, and they will always be looking at my work with Microsoft Word. I want to be confident that we are looking at the exact same thing.

An **important sidenote** is that I will be visiting cafes very often for doing both types of work (I have ADHD etc. and can't concentrate at home). My previous workhorse (X1 Carbon Gen 6) died after a random customer spilt coffee on my keyboard. I proudly let him go, because back then I was brainwashed by Lenovo marketing and said ""Oh it's alright, ThinkPads are spill-proof!"". It died a few weeks later. Getting a replacement motherboard and keyboard online resulted me in unscrewing 70+ screws for a much crappier keyboard. It's functional now, but now my screen is failing, and I mentally gave up. So getting **Premier Support Plus, perhaps for five years,** sounds like a prerequisite for frequent cafe-goers like me.

Anyway, after much searching, I came to the preliminary conclusion of either getting the **E14 Gen 7 ILL** (with Intel Core Ultra 5 228V, the one with 32 GB of Memory-on-Chip RAM) or the **X1 Carbon Gen 13** (with Intel Core Ultra 7 258V, as there's no 228V option. I can't go with 226V because 16GB of RAM seems too non-future-proof). Here are the reasons. Correct me if I'm wrong on anything:

* Lunar Lake is very efficient and is suitable for my use case.
* Lunar Lake seems to be a [""unicorn""](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/1nixbhn/is_the_thinkpad_x1_carbon_gen_13_a_unicorn/) for the time being. It's the only generation to feature a built-in Memory-on-Chip to save additional power, and the next generation (Panther Lake) will not have as powerful an iGPU on the U series.
* I have ADHD and struggle with keeping notes, so Windows Recall (a Copilot+ PC-only feature) seems very attractive to me.
* I plan to use this ThinkPad for a long time, probably until Intel finally delivers Unified Core on the 14A or better process with Thunderbolt 5. With a good iGPU, Lunar Lake should be fine for five years (it's not that I will never use my ThinkPad for recreational purposes, although heavy gaming is not my thing).
* I want a screen with more than 1920x1200 resolution (2880x1800 seems to be the only available alternative, whether IPS or OLED). I plan to translate by placing the original document on the left half of the screen, and typing/translating in Word on the right half of the screen. I don't want individual pixels visible when looking at text. 14 inch seems to be the best/smallest size where I can do that, and current 16-inchers are not Copilot+ compatible (and heavy, although I can definitely take it to a cafe that is only 5 minutes away). The E series and the X1 Carbon are the only Lunar Lake ThinkPads with a screen resolution above 1920x1200.
* AMD Krackan Point is generally seen to be a great competitor to Lunar Lake, but apparently it's only available for the P series, which I'm not sure is good for me. But I'm still very open to suggestions.

With that preliminary conclusion in mind, I went to a retailer that had ThinkPads on display and got to test an X1 Carbon Gen 13 and an E14 (though it wasn't the Gen 7). Here are my thoughts:

* I was pleasantly surprised that the E series didn't look cheapo at all. Also, after going back and forth about five times to test its keyboard quality against the X1 Carbon Gen 13, I concluded that the E14's keyboard quality is the same if not only very marginally worse than the X1 Carbon Gen 13's.
* The Trackpoint on the X1 Carbon Gen 13 was godlike. I could move and curve the cursor just like my brain wished.
* Maybe it's just because it was on display at a brightly-lit store, but I thought the X1 Carbon Gen 13's OLED screen (the only option offering more than 1920x1200 resolution) is too dim when brightness is reduced to 50%ish. Using it at a cafe (my most common use case) may result in less than 5ish hours of battery life on a sunny day. But then I thought: A GaN-type AC adaptor is nothing too heavy to have in one's ThinkPad bags these days, so is battery life really an issue issue? But the very point of an X1 Carbon is that it is engineered to be light to the last gram, so doesn't carrying an AC Adaptor defeat its purpose and philosophy? My head is spinning.

As per the above, I have the following questions:

1. Was my phenomenal experience with the X1 Carbon Gen 13's TrackPoint merely a matter of the so-called ""parts lottery""? I haven't found a post on r/thinkpad that glorifies the TrackPoint on the X1 Carbon Gen 13. Can I theoretically end up with an E14 Gen 7 ILL with an equally awesome TrackPoint, and a worse TrackPoint on the X1 Carbon Gen 13?
2. The keyboard on both machines is worse than the late X1 Carbon Gen 6, probably because of reduced key travel (1.8mm back then to 1.5mm). **Frequent typers (like translators and writers)\*\*\*\*:** **Would you say that this is something one will get used to in the end?** Or is it worthwhile to explore **Plan C: Get a used X1 Carbon Gen 6, with 1.8mm key travel?**
3. I'm currently leaning towards the E14 Gen 7 ILL. The battery capacity is higher, with X1C at 57Wh and E14 at 64Wh (available as a BTO option). Also, the 2880x1800 screen of the E14 is IPS, whereas the X1 Carbon's is OLED, which apparently has a worse battery life. Premier Support Plus is cheaper too, as the E14 is naturally much less expensive. In total, the ""X1 Carbon Owner's Pride Premium"" amounts to something over $1000 (unless I take the better TrackPoint to be worth that much). Am I missing something?
4. [Rakuten Rebates' kickback](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/1ojd9mq/psa_the_rakuten_kickback_on_lenovo_us_is_15_today/) can go up to 20% in Japan, but it usually shows up for one day in early December after the Black Friday deals end, so I must choose between getting the Black Friday deal or getting Rakuten's kickback. A particular concern of mine is that Premier Support Plus is 50% off during the Black Friday season in Japan, which lasts till December 4th. A five-year Premier Plus support plan for the X1 Carbon normally costs $813.35 here (translated from JPY). If the 50% off is gone when Black Friday ends, getting a Rebates-kickbacked machine won't result in much, if any, profit after accounting for the non-discounted five-year Premier Plus support. Are support packages almost always discounted in the Lenovo retail online store one way or another, just like some models are almost always at 40%+ off?",1,1764417639.0,thinkpad,0,1.0,False

Elderly Man Furious To Learn He Has Survived Perfectly Good 80-MPH Head-On Crash With Coffee Shop

11/29/2025 3:10 AM

**LOS GATOS, CA:** Witnesses report that a 90-year-old local driver is “absolutely livid” after walking away from an estimated 70 to 100 mile per hour head-on collision with a beloved downtown coffee shop on Thanksgiving night, ruining what friends and family quietly suspected was his carefully planned kamikaze exit from yet another holiday at the relatives’.

***\[Short pause\]***

According to investigators, the driver left “one more godforsaken Thanksgiving” in his black Volvo, muttering something about “the pilgrims dying for less than this dry turkey,” before calmly signaling, checking his mirrors, and then flooring it straight down University Avenue toward the Los Gatos Coffee Roasting Company at Main and University.

Security footage reportedly shows the Volvo lining up the entrance like a fighter pilot on final approach, briefly activating its blinker, then converting the front register, pastry case, and cold brew tower into a single unified concept called “debris,” finally coming to rest partially on top of the shop’s coffee roaster.

***\[Beat, drier tone\]***

“He did everything right if his goal was to leave this earth,” said one officer on scene, gesturing at the caved-in storefront and completely untouched tray of gluten free baked goods. “Elderly, holiday-related stress, black Volvo, straight shot into a building at highway speeds. Textbook old man kamikaze. Unfortunately for him, modern safety features and airbags have once again intervened to trap a citizen in his own life.”

Paramedics and firefighters were able to extricate the driver from the sedan and transport him to a nearby hospital, where he was listed in serious but stable condition and, according to witnesses, overwhelmingly annoyed about it.

***\[More energy\]***

“Most people ask if anyone else is hurt,” said one paramedic. “He looked at the car sticking out of the coffee shop, looked at us, saw his family running up crying and said, ‘You have got to be kidding me. I missed? Just kill me now. Fuck.’ Then he sighed like we had just told him he needed another software update.”

***\[Dry, resigned delivery\]***

Family members admit the driver has been “in a mood” for years about being forced to attend holiday gatherings, a tradition he allegedly refers to as “annual hostage negotiations with pie.” Sources at the Thanksgiving table confirm that shortly before the incident, he was overheard saying things like, “I survived world history so I could listen to Brenda explain essential oils,” and, “If I make it through one more story about Kevin’s fantasy football team I am driving into something.”

  
***\[Shift to surreal tone\]***

Patrons who regularly visit the cafe describe the crash as “terrifying” and “really loud,” followed by the surreal mental image of a 90-year-old man calmly unbuckling himself from an accordion-shaped Volvo, standing up inside what used to be the café side, and asking if anyone nearby had “a quick, clean way out of this” while brushing fiberglass off his cardigan.

“Everything in the café side was destroyed, the roaster got hit, plumbing broken, water into the basement, inventory wrecked,” said one of the owners, still stunned. “And this guy just climbs out of the middle of it all like he parallel parked wrong and wants to speak to a manager about it.”

A barista on scene said they instinctively tried to offer customer service. “I brought him a free latte because he literally drove through our front door,” they explained. “He took one sip, looked at the ceiling, and said, ‘Great, this tastes like nutmeg and regret. Guess I really am still alive.’ Then he asked if the hospital had a loyalty program where nine concussions gets you a permanent nap.”

***\[News-anchor matter-of-fact\]***

Doctors at a local medical center confirm that the driver is expected to make a full recovery and will likely be discharged in time for his family’s traditional leftover Thanksgiving lunch, where he will once again be seated at what he reportedly calls “the witness stand,” also known as the head of the table.

“Medically speaking, it is a miracle,” said one attending physician. “He is 90 years old, drives a black Volvo straight into a coffee institution at freeway speed, and walks away with a bruised rib and slightly elevated blood pressure. From a cardiology standpoint he is a tank. From a quality of life standpoint he is, in his own words, ‘serving a supernatural sentence.’”

***\[Slow, dry, final quote\]***

Reached for comment, the driver reportedly stared out his hospital window for a full 30 seconds before finally saying, “I spent my whole life paying insurance premiums so that when I finally tried to punch my ticket, the airbags would snitch. Now I am going to physical therapy so my hips are strong enough to attend more family Thanksgivings. God really does have a dark sense of humor.”

***\[Tag out\]***

At press time, city inspectors had yellow-tagged the building, engineers were determining when the 45-year-old coffee shop and community “second living room” could reopen, and family members were reportedly discussing taking away the driver’s keys, while the driver was reportedly discussing driving the entire family minivan into a Cracker Barrel “just to see if anyone finally gets the hint this time.”

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Toronto Raptors vs. Charlotte Hornets: A Statistical Slapstick Showdown**

The Toronto Raptors, fresh off a nine-game winning streak and riding a 14-5 record, are set to face the 5-14 Charlotte Hornets in a matchup that’s as lopsided as a pancake at a buffet. With the Raptors favored by 8.5 points and a 77.78% implied probability of victory, this game feels less like an NBA contest and more like a math test where Charlotte forgot to study. Let’s break it down with the precision of a point guard and the humor of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many cups of coffee.

---

### Parse the Odds: Why the Raptors Are Math’s Favorite Team

The Raptors aren’t just favored—they’re *mathematically* favored. Their 77.78% win probability (based on -700 odds) suggests they’re about as likely to lose as a toaster is to start a jazz band. Charlotte’s 26.67% chance? That’s the statistical equivalent of flipping a coin and it landing on its edge *twice in a row*.

Historically, Toronto has owned Charlotte in this rivalry, winning 8 of the last 10 meetings, including a 110-108 thriller in their most recent clash. The Hornets’ defense, which allows a league-worst 120.6 points per game, is like a sieve that’s been challenged by a waterfall. Meanwhile, Toronto’s defense ranks 4th in the league, holding opponents to 112.5 PPG—impressive enough to make a librarian whisper, “Shhh, don’t let the Hornets score.”

Offensively, the Raptors average 119.2 PPG, while Charlotte musters just 115.7. The over/under for this game is 231.5, but with a combined average of 234.9 points between these teams, bettors should treat the “Over” like a free appetizer at a buffet—take it, and don’t look back.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Three-Pointers, and a Touch of Absurdity

Charlotte’s injury report reads like a who’s-who of “Day-to-Day” drama: Grant Williams (ACL), Pat Connaughton (calf), and Josh Green (shoulder) are all out, leaving the Hornets with the depth of a puddle in a drought. Without these players, Charlotte’s hopes rest on Moussa Diabate (9.4 PPG, 8.1 RPG) and a prayer—preferably one shouted into a wind tunnel.

Toronto isn’t exactly healthy, but they’re missing only RJ Barrett (knee), which is like losing a backup battery for a smartphone. The Raptors still have Brandon Ingram (21.8 PPG, 5.9 RPG) and Scottie Barnes (19.5 PPG, 7.9 RPG), a duo as reliable as a microwave and a stapler in an office.

1. He once had me smell beans that he said had a vanilla-like aroma.
2. He sometimes makes coffee that has a slightly sour taste (which I think you might call ""bright"" or ""acidic""?).
3. He seems to enjoy both chocolatey types and these brighter, aromatic ones.
4. He says high quality coffee beans have a lot more flavor other than just being bitter.

Budget: we agreed int the budget of around 200 RMB (~$28 USD).

Key Point: I'm looking for something special or unique—maybe a single-origin or a specific processing method that would be a treat for someone who knows his stuff.

Left to right: Fantasy Intense, YSL Black Opium Over Red (3oz and 1.6oz bottles), Naked Fantasy, Candied Fantasy, and Festive Fantasy. 

My signature scent used to be Fantasy Intense, but I've since discovered Black Opium Over Red and while it's a significantly higher price point, I've absolutely fallen in love with it and it's my current signature. I wear all of these occasionally, sometimes layer 2 or 3 of them, but I wear Over Red almost daily (especially to work-- I'm a bartender, so I think a dark sultry gourmand fits the vibe). I've consistently gotten compliments on each and every one of these. 

My favorite notes are strawberry, cherry, vanilla, coffee, jasmine, citrus, patchouli, sandalwood, and any type of cake-oriented gourmand. I also love lactonic notes like whipped cream, which is really the only thing not covered in my collection. Naked Fantasy has some light lactonic notes, but when I layer it with Over Red, it tends to get completely overpowered by the latter. 

Can anyone recommend a lactonic that would fit my tastes, that might layer well with Over Red? I'm leaning towards Sweet Tooth Me Espresso by Sabrina Carpenter, as it apparently has coffee, gourmand, jasmine, and strong lactonic (whipped cream specifically) notes. However, I've seen very mixed reviews. I've also considered maybe Venus in Tuberose, as it has lime as well as supposedly strong lactonic vanilla ice cream notes.

*By Your Humorously Analytical AI Sportswriter*

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of La Liga’s most desperate survivors: **RCD Mallorca** vs. **CA Osasuna**. This mid-table melee, scheduled for November 29, 2025, is less of a football match and more of a “who’s less terrible?” contest. Let’s break it down with the precision of a GPS and the wit of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many coffees.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Mathematically Sound Case for Chaos

The bookmakers have priced this like a high-stakes poker game. **Mallorca** is the favorite at decimal odds of \~2.30 (implied probability: \~43.5%), while **Osasuna** is a shaky underdog at \~3.40 (\~29.4%). The draw? A tidy 3.00 (\~33.3%), because nothing says “thrilling finale” like a stalemate.

But here’s the kicker: Osasuna is the **worst away team in La Liga**, earning just **1 point from seven road games** this season. That’s the footballing equivalent of bringing a spoon to a sword fight. Meanwhile, Mallorca’s home form is… well, let’s say it’s not great, but at least they’ve got the crowd’s support (and a pre-match tribute to Rafa Nadal, which might distract the players into scoring accidentally).

---

### Injury Report: When Absences Write the Script

**Osasuna** is missing key defender **Catena**, forcing **Boyomo** and **Herrando** to don the center-back jerseys like they’re playing “Guess Who?” with their confidence. Meanwhile, **Mallorca** has restored **Sergi Darder** and **Muriqi** to the lineup, presumably after they recovered from whatever existential crises they were having on the bench.

Osasuna’s coach, **Arrasate**, has benched **Pablo Torre** and **Antonio Sánchez** despite their heroics against Villarreal. Why? Maybe he’s channeling his inner psychologist, thinking a nap will fix their form.

### Historical Context: A Love-Hate Relationship

I’m currently sick and stuck at home for the weekend, which has given me a rare pocket of time with zero distractions. For the first time in a long while I can actually think clearly, and I’ve realized how much of my normal daily life is just mindless loops: come home from work → boot up the PC → video games / pr0n / junk food → sleep → repeat. That’s literally it.

While I’m in this calm bubble it feels obvious that I want to change: get back to the gym, cook real food, fix my finances, keep the apartment clean, build actual hobbies, etc. The motivation and clarity are there right now.

But I know myself. As soon as I’m back in the usual environment with the same cues (computer available, console on the coffee table, ice cream store next door, phone always calling for me…), the old habits will win again in a heartbeat because I won't have the time I have now to identify this isn't how I want to live anymore. I'll just go back into autopilot mode.

So my question to people who have successfully broken similar loops:

What are the smartest, most effective ways you found to just keep in mind the changes you want to make? I'm not even asking about implementing changes, only about how to keep in mind that I want to make a change. I usually, during my day to day life, don't have any mental space and energy to even think about changing my situation. 

But if you have tips on how to implement changes I welcome them, it's just that I don't think I'm even at this level now. 

I don’t need another motivational speech; I need practical advices.

If you see yourself in the description and live in London, I’d be happy if you carry on reading.
About me:
5’ 4, slim/athletic build, longish dark red hair, brown eyes, fair skin, young looking - according to people.
Straight and (ideally) looking for a long term relationship if we’re compatible.
I’m childfree by choice for life - I adore dogs though!
I love keeping fit and being healthy: hiking and kayaking are 2 of my favourite outdoor activities.
I also like cozy time at home reading, watching a film with a plot (especially crime stories) or having a nice meal.
Teetotal, non-smoker and drug free from birth.
Coffee lover.
70s/80s rock/hard rock music is another passion of mine.
I’m into vintage clothes and my fashion style is inspired by the 70s aesthetics.
I have an active job which I love.
I’m a bit of an introvert and value my independence; I’m also quite straightforward and don’t beat around the bush.
Oh and last but not least: I’m a simple, happy person who enjoys the little things in life.
About you:
Fitting the description in the title and living in London.
Taller than me - it doesn’t take much!
Straight and monogamous, putting effort in building a relationship without giving up at the first disagreement (and I’ll do the same).
Simple and down to earth, someone I can discuss things with and who’s not ashamed of having a personality.
Age wise, I prefer someone in their 30s but I’m not really fussy about it, as long as you’re mature enough, sporty and look after yourself; late 20s and early 40s will do too.
You share some of my values: drug free, non smoker and childfree are not negotiable, sorry; if you’re teetotal even better, but I don’t mind if you drink moderately.
Bonus points if you share my passion for travelling!
If most of the above resonates with you, why not give it a try?!?

She lives with him and I've met him a few times, they have a house together. He's selfish, he talks all the time, and he has no filter so he says inappropriate things and doesn't seem to care about anyone else around him. 

A few examples: 

At her dad's funeral, he left early. If I hadn't been there she would have been on her own. At her dad's funeral. 

He gave away their new puppy while she was at work because he couldn't handle it.

When I stayed over, on the sofabed, he came downstairs topless, playing music from his phone, and proceeded to smoke and make coffee while I was still trying to sleep. 

There's a lot more to it but that's the basics. 

The recent event (the puppy giveaway) has really made me distance from her and we haven't spoken much recently. Im moving away from her and I don't know whether to say anything. By the way, she is aware of what he's like. She struggles with anxiety so we haven't talked much about it because she knows I'm angry with him and she doesn't want to face it.

Serious question here, as many of you are familiar with online dating, and the world has changed since I've last dated.

I'm one-year post separation from a ten year partnership. This year I've been working on myself, therapy, finishing postgraduate studies, sport, and getting my head together. I am now mentally strong enough to expose myself to dating.

I'm a totally mid looking dude. Fit, but not jacked, and not shredded. I play combat sports so I'm in a weight category (I don't bulk) and at the moment manage my volume of training, strength and conditioning with a caloric excess so I'm maybe around 12% bf.

I put effort into my appearance and grooming and style. Might have a bit of a face card going on based on feedback I've received but until I get fucked again I'm not taking that seriously.

Educated, lived overseas, well read, 'worldly' but from working class background which means bougie women have historically seen me as an exciting bad boy or tampon but not somebody to seriously date. Never being in that position again.

My demographic is probably early 30s-40s, most likely other people who are solo parents too. I have some more specific things that I'm non negotiable on and things I believe will strongly affect compatibility but no need to list that.

I don't want to seriously date at the moment. I want confirmation I am desirable and to experiment with the market to inform realistic expectations. A couple of enjoyable coffee dates is my metric of success. The problem is I don't have much time. Between my kid and I we are grappling almost every day of the week or doing gym, hiking, outdoor stuff, errands, spending time at parks. My other free time is spent being a dad, working on fun projects, or working on my career transition.

My other problem is my social circle completely changed when I became a father. Outside of work, I have two identities: the dad who socializes with other families in the school area, and my identity on and around the mat. So I'm not isolated (socially stretched tbh) but I don't have a close group of friends I do fun things with (I do fun things with other people) nor access to a social scene that allows me to meet new people (aside from sport but not a lot of women and a higher risk environment to shoot a shot, don't really want to think about that where I train).

I would strongly prefer to meet people in person because it takes more social engagement and you can feel each other's chemistry out. It's also more likely to lead to friendship and acquaintanceship if it doesn't go romantically. However, I need to be realistic about my time constraints and I'm not willing to cut back on training (serious about increasing my competition schedule next year) or my career development at the moment.

So, I figure it's worth at least trying dating apps. I expect nothing from them based on the doom and gloom I hear and it's not an ideal way to offset social abundance but it is what it is.

Other guys in their 30s who have gone through this, what is your experience? Any advice you have? 

I'm living in topsy-turvy world where I've never been fitter, healthier, more disciplined, more organized, and have this much to give, but I'm in a drought where the most attention I get is eye contact and smiles from women when I'm out and about or having some semi-flirty conversations with married mums. When I was a uni student I was a drug fucked asshole hipster who looked anorexic and I had no shortage of attention or sex. Times have changed but it's really an issue of not being able to meet (available) people on a regular basis.

I was fortunate enough to be able to pass C720 in 10 days on the first attempt. I had a great instructor; from the day I started the course she sent me a very long detailed outline of what I needed to do to be able to pass with attachments and review questions. Instructor: **Dr. Jamie Daigle.** If you do not have her as an instructor from day 1 I HIGHLY encourage you to request to switch. A lot of people have recommended Dr. Hayward on YouTube which did help a lot but I did not focus on his material, because WGU likes to use their verbiage on the test and I did not want to rely on Dr. Hayward's definitions, but it did help.

  
Good Luck! I hope this helps! I will try and pin the first comment with the PDF that was provided to me. (make sure to read the heading of the section because I got confused. it bounced from different sections, but was very helpful)

My study process:   
**Taking the Pre-Assessment (PA):**

\- I do this with every course, I take the PA immediately before going into my course work, so I know what I am getting into with the terms and what to look out for when taking notes. 

\- After completing all the course work (6 Sections), I took the PA again, I did not pass. I went back to review the sections I did poorly on. 

\- I took the PA again, passed. 

**How I Studied:**  

\- I would wake up, make my coffee and review 1 to 1.5 sections per day. I read ""almost"" every single word on each page and took notes in my OneNote on what I thought were important notes. \[Reason to read every single word is there are almost 5 questions within the OA that use scenarios of situations on how which theory was used.\]

\- I skipped over the Section/Unit Tests at the end of the section. I wanted to keep pounding material in my head (pause) and not get frustrated and slow down my notes.

  
\- During my break where my brain felt fried; I would go downstairs of my apartment building fitness center and do 45-60 minutes of cardio on the treadmill with Dr. Hayward playing [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5\_qO7P2XjBd86Pw0SQVTaA88nHTj1I3e&si=WX0Dwf\_Bk6K9UyOf](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5_qO7P2XjBd86Pw0SQVTaA88nHTj1I3e&si=WX0Dwf_Bk6K9UyOf) ; (I was going to take hand-written notes as well, but he explained the material enough in simplest form, I did not need to review it again.)

  
\- 4 days prior to OA, I was provided a PDF with all the section and review questions on one PDF by Dr. Daigle. I did not have to bounce around from section to section and navigate. It has explanations of which answers are correct and explanations of why, as well as the incorrect answers.

  
**Objective Assessment (OA):**

\- Preparation for the OA, Remember I said I did not take the Section/Unit Review questions... 2 days prior to scheduling my OA, I went back and took those review tests. I was able to relax my mind and focus on the question and READ THEM OUT LOUD. I read each question and the explanation, even if I got the question right.

\- OA, the OA was structured very similar to the PA. I was surprised. I just passed D075 it was NOTHING like the PA. The PA is not verbatim, but the thought processing and scenarios of the questions were similar. I was very happy. 

\- I took an hour for this assessment. I took about 30-90 seconds per question. They did switch some wording around but honestly it was not bad. Just be careful and read the question slowly. Do not jump to the first answer that aligns with the key words in the question.",3,1764415923.0,WGU,1,1.0,False

I was initially very excited about it. I woke up in an excellent mood today, made a cup of coffee and started writing. However, I quickly discovered that the only thing I could think (and write) about was how long it took, how bad my hand and back started hurting and how ugly my handwriting turned out because of it. The more I wrote, the more it pissed me off. I have a chronic back condition that causes me terrible pain and migraines too when I’m not careful and sit in one place for too long. I also have an issue with my right hand which too causes me pain after prolonged tasks. I didn’t think it would turn out to be such a problem but it looks like I was wrong. So the whole endeavour took me about an hour of nonstop writing and as a result I now have 3 illegible pages, horrible back and hand pain, I’m on the verge of a migraine attack, I can’t play my instrument because of the pain and I’m in a very bad mood. I’m also apalled at how much negativity such a simple exercise could unleash in me.

I know these pages are somehow supposed to help with your creativity but I feel they’re doing exactly the opposite for me. I loved the book and the ideas in it so far but I can’t imagine going through this everyday for 12 weeks. 

I apologize for the rant, I guess my question is, is there some kind of a workaround here? Like for example, does typing the pages have the same benefit for you or do they have to be handwritten? I used to love journaling and now I realize this is exactly why I stopped doing it at some point. I still want to give this program a try so any advice would be much much appreciated!",1,1764415735.0,artistsWay,0,1.0,False

I’m happiest with small, slow, simple things: Beach walks.
A coffee and a chat.
Quiet mornings.
No plans.
Space to breathe.

I *can* enjoy busy weekends sometimes, little trips, events, going out, doing things... But I can’t live at that pace all the time. I don’t want every weekend to feel full or scheduled, because I get completely overwhelmed and exhausted by it.

My girlfriend has ADHD, and thrives on energy, movement, and plans. She loves being out, doing things, and making memories. I accept that about her, and I’ve never tried to limit her life or stop her from doing what she enjoys.

The issue is, that she really wants to do everything with me, and when I don’t have the energy or desire for constant plans, it hurts her deeply. She struggles to regulate her emotions around it and often feels rejected or unloved when I need quiet or space. That creates a lot of tension between us because she feels abandoned, and I feel overwhelmed and guilty.

It’s starting to feel like: If I stay, I lose myself.
If I leave, I lose the person I love...

And I don’t know how you’re supposed to choose between those.

Has anyone here had to choose between a relationship and the life their nervous system needed? 

I've been trying for a year to stay in this dynamic, constantly bending my comfort zone to keep our relationship going, but even then it still doesn't feel ""enough"".

1p9mn74,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p9mn74,I was today years old when I realized that my favorite star is actually Jupiter,"When I was a kid, I used to be fascinated by this one star because it was the brightest among all the stars I could see.

Each night, I would gaze at it through my window while lying in bed until I dozed off.

Many years later, one night as I sat on my balcony sipping a cup of coffee, my eyes caught sight of the same star. In that moment, I was instantly transported back to my childhood days.

The very next moment, I decided to figure out exactly which star I was looking at. So I started investigating and learned that its name is Menkar, from the constellation Cetus.

I was thrilled to finally know the identity of my favorite star, until today, when I was walking on my terrace at night and spotted it again. My curiosity surged once more, so I downloaded an app called SkyView Lite from the App Store (not sponsored). It basically tells you which celestial body you’re looking at if you point your camera toward it. To my surprise, it turned out to be Jupiter. 😭

I felt so stupid after that. I was like, how come I didn’t know it’s literally a planet in our solar system, and that too the biggest one? 😭

But hey, everybody *stars* somewhere (pun intended). At least I still have the enthusiasm to explore different celestial bodies.

1p9mkms,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarkNarrations/comments/1p9mkms/the_harrowing_tale_of_training_my_replacement_aka/,The harrowing tale of training my replacement. aka stupid coworker story.,"Hi everyone, I posted a comment on Mark's question about funky coworkers (the Jake in the bakery story). Somebody replied that they would be interested in the whole story, and I have been meaning to write about it as a therapy exercise. It's long and rambly; English is not my first language, so sorry about all of that, plus formatting is pretty shit. 





So I work as a security guard for a company that puts me to work at other companies, and I would do this anonymously, but it's so specific what I did that it doesn't matter if I'm vague or not. 

So, to get the explaining out of the way, I refer to my actual employer as a security company and the customer company as the company or contract company.



Three years ago I started working at a large firm in Amsterdam, placed there by Sec-Com to work not just as a security guard but also as a (very fancy title that does not actually exist in my line of work and an actual dead give away so not using it) my purpose was the mainainance and training of Emergency Response Officers (ERO) and the greater ERO organization as a whole, when I came there the whole thing was on its ass. I as somebody that didn't train for this, got no actually relevant training from my company. Almost zero working experience had to figure it all out by myself.



 It had its ups and downs, but I managed and got to a very good spot of actually doing it and managing it well, with some help from great colleagues. I got down the line and learned a lot from them. 

Well then, I got sick, cancer. I was out of the running, and they had to place a replacement who fucked shit up so badly that they decided to take away the day ERO shifts and give those to a different company that was basically Fire Guards, people who inspect buildings for fire hazards and other hazardous things. Note that they are not security guards, which I found out later, and the company expects them to do security tasks, which they are neither trained for nor have the credentials to do most of the security they want them to perform. 



This was roughly a year ago, so they dropped this on me that I wasn't training my new coworker, but my replacement, right before Christmas 2024. 



Backstory out of the way, I tend to ramble. 



Thus begins our tale. I 28 male at the time, Jay male 37\~ and Ronald 61\~.

So, after letting me know that my new coworker, Jay, was my replacement, and a challenging conversation with my manager and boss, they would find me a suitable replacement to work at. Well, they did expect me to train the two newcomers to the best of my ability, which I promised to do. And mama raised no weakling. 



So Jay explained to me there are two types of Fire Guards: those who are current or ex-firemen, and those who got their diploma through the government and were the shittiest people you can imagine. 

Jay was the perfect guy, wanted to learn, brought his own input without immediately overstepping, and was experienced and a great guy. 

Ronald, on the other hand, was something else; he was an ex-police officer, did border control on an island, so I dunno. He is the type of guy to speak a lot without action.



When Ronald got here, he came with the assumption that he would be some sort of manager delegating tasks and not doing them himself. But he also asked questions like a toddler in the why phase. 

I had to make clear to him that we have to do every task ourselves, and his response to every task was, 'So who is supposed to do that?' and I would reply after the 7th time with a sigh and say that we are supposed to do that. 

Normally, when I arrive at the building, I would do a security/inspection round around the building, tell all my trainees that it's a good thing to start your day, then grab your radio, security phone, and your laptop, grab a drink, and when it's 07:30, join the receptionist up front till her backup gets there. 



But Ronald wouldn't do any work before 07:30, so let the receptionist sit there alone while he does the basic tasks. 

There is a lot that Ronald did and didn't do. And I had to explain to him every time why he couldn't do things or should do things. He praised me for being so patient by explaining things to him over and over again, spoiler, I'm not a patient person at all. 



He used his phone to take pictures of protected data on computer screens and was surprised that it wasn't allowed, and annoyed when I asked him to delete the images. 



Because the security phone was usually empty after the weekend, he suggested keeping it on charge the entire weekend. Didn't see that it was a fire hazard. Had to explain that to him. 



A week later, he still found it very strange when he brought it up again. 



Would constantly bring up the same questions.



Uses ChatGPT for his work, but says he changes it to his own words, but doesn't want to write documents if it can be done more easily.

 

We had to count the occupancy of the building for the registration of the people from the different companies each day. It was about the 4th time he was doing it. There were four options to click in the program: Update area status, view map, occupancy report, and move badges. He couldn't find it. I pointed at it, but he just couldn't fucking click the button without me doing it. 



About 3 weeks in, and he hasn't written down a single note on paper. At this point, I'm turning crazy with frustration. At this point, I don't know if the word was too hard for him; he didn't like it, but he just didn't get it. 



His manager would come that Friday, fun. I asked him to register his manager as a guest, he asked if he was supposed to do that, he found it strange, and I sighed and explained it all again. 



Later, I asked him if he had his manager's license plate, and he answered: ""I will not register him, let him feel it."" (I did not ask him what he meant by that.) I did say that I found it weird, he laughed, and in the end, he called his manager. 



Later when we where at the reception he asked me if I registerd his manager already. I said that I did not do that since I do not have his name, license plate, and time of arrival. Ronald looked very annoyed at my answer. 



Later that day, when taking over the reception, I sat down with him to explain to him everything again, how to register a visitor. The day before, a kind receptionist had spent 3 hours with him explaining everything. 

I asked him to bring his laptop when I left for the reception, and he didn't show up until five minutes later, and you guessed it, without his laptop. I asked him where his laptop was, he said he needed help with setting it up. I answered that I could help with that and he didn't reply?? 



I had to go to the back office real quick and came upon 'A', the office manager essentially my direct supervisor and contact with Sec-Com, she asked me who's laptop was laying there, I answered it was Ronalds. She went upfront to calmy ask him why he hasn't set up his laptop yet, she explains to him how it works, and that he can't do this at home since he needs to be connected to company wifi to use the laptop. 

I don't know how or why but Ronald interperted that wrongly and instantly became angry and defensive. He told her that 'You only came here because He (me) sent you to me. (that wasn't the case, which she also told him.) 



When I returned he was angry with me with above reasons, Not like I was fixing his incompetence again, again explaining how to register a visitor , turns out the guy didn't even turn on his laptop. 



Confirmed he hasn't taken a single note, and he stinks, and out of his mouth as well. 



Told him three times to go to IT, there is a sign, with a phone number and that he had to call it. Mister Ronald returned with the QR code from the leave a compliment/complaint sign. Later with some weird website, Then he finally returned with the correct information, I had to explain to this adult man that yes, he had to call the damn number. Cauce when he came back to me. He was confused. 'I have to call?'



Next day, I'm reporting to 'A' about the training progress I told her that Ronald is doing currently the occupancy task, but instead of actually doing that, we see him stroll past us, through the window to go out and smoke. I sigh and leave the office and go back up front. It's driving me crazy. 



So every time a difficult task, comes up, topic or whatever. He leaves to walk a round. Like tf are you gonna do during an evacuation, walk a round you have done for the 4th time today. 



You are not allowed as a support staff employee to park at this office, only higher rank office staff are permitted to do so, Ronald explains that if he can't park his car he won't work here. Which is fair, but he lived four stops away from the office. For him going by car it would add to his comute instead of traveling a total of 10 minutes. Just some weird Ronald logic.



During lunch we do security checks when employees leave the building they have their badge on them, check out and in properly, people dont use it as an oppertunity to sneak in. Or take out the restaurants plates etc. outside which happens a lot and people are not allowed to do.



Most corporate employees, while sweet in their own way, are generally childish idiots when they don't get their way. Ronald, on the other hand, was on his phone and was surprised that he couldn't be on his phone when he was keeping watch. He found that strange and disagreed with me. He had the eyes of a hawk. He said when somebody tail-gated right in front of him and didn't take action. I send the person back in and we had the same conversation a lot. 





So few days later, I have hit the mark of going through training Ronald from december and January I have explained to my bosses that he is so damn incompetent that you can't allow him to work without a good conscience. They don't really believe me, but I called him a walking disaster. (I checked over the month of January alone, I mentioned Ronalds name atleat 13 times to my boss)



You may wonder where Jay is, they put him on another job, So back to training Ronald. 



He is looking for the january rapport in the februari and march folder and is confused why he can't find it. So I tell him he has to write the rapport and also send the one from the previous day to the customer companies managers, and my direct Sec-com supervisor. 08:10 the second receptionist arrives and I leave to do my tasks, Ronald decided to stay, eventually comes and then without saying a word after thirty minutes leaves for the reception. 



Apparantly to call with IT to complain that he doesn't have the security programs yet. IT doesn't do that. That's corporate security's task that, which 'A' explained to him that he had to wait till the sixth. 



I lost Ronald, a receptionist, who asked me to get a badge from the safe for the cleaner since Ronald had ignored her. I found him there on the phone, ignoring everyone around him when I retrieved the badge from the safe. 



Around 09:40 I asked if it was working out with the rapport, he told me that he had to wait until the service desk responded to his Teams message. I told him that in the meantime, he can send the report. He said he couldn't do it since his manager was coming, so I just repeated my answer to him that it could be easily done. Ronald got defensive again and said that with me, everything is quick, quick, and he does everything relaxed, and he didn't work like that. 'Well now is the time for a sanitary break if its allowed by you.' I replied that he shouldn't be so childish. and he walked off. When he was away I downloaded the rapport to compare and make sure it got actually done. 



Around 09:56, his manager arrived.

In the end he needed help with the names to whom he had to send the email. he had the names written down right in front of him. the rapport was send out 11:30. 



My other coworker and I where having a coffee and Ronald and his manager walked in. He said something about me followed with a loud but otherwise a smart boy. Then, followed by something again, we couldn't hear. 



In his rapport he wrote down that he was supporting the reception but he was sitting there without his laptop just chatting not doing anything. 



There is so much more. The 8 week training period got extended by 2 weeks since he needed it. It didn't work. The timeline is out of wack its been a year now. I wrote down 11 pages worth of stuff on my note app to tell my boss, many a angry phone call that they could not place this guy here, he is clearly not capable. They need Jay, he is excellent at this job, furtermore i discovered that they have no actual security credentials and thus not permited to view camera, or use the occupancy counting program which does a lot more of security stuff. 



So in these final weeks I had both Ronald and Jay, Ronald was late one day and I hoped he wouldn't be there but showing up two hours late without any notice was okay in his book. But my joy evaporated when he showed up. I decided another tactic was needed. I apoloziged and said I realized I have been training them as security guards, which I didn't know. Jay knew it didn't mean anything but Ronald that narcisist didn't and it worked like a charm. He insantly became more receptive to everything still a major cunt tho. 



So let us continue, Jay and Ronald both had to give a training to our ERO team, Ronald made stuff up that didn't exsist gave fake and faulty info that I had to save the day, confronted him later and gave him again the emergency plan to read, which he promtly set aside and didn't read. 'I don't take orders from you.' Well, Jay, did it perfectly and I learned something from him although he did ramble on about non relevant stuff confusing the participants. 



New ERO tour, when a new ERO recruit joins the team I give them the tour of the ground floor including the hidden area's they never will see so they know what it looks like locations of AED and Emergency kits, evacuation route, gathering locations, what they should do incase of an evacuation. Jay did it naturally, Ronald just didn't. 



Ronald got mad again at me for whatever reason, he said that I didn't have any people experience, used some flowery words to call me incompetent and that he shouldn't have to listen to me. I got angry but said, Are you calling me incompetent? I don't have to take that from a guy who can't do the most basic task. Jay got inbetween us and defended me and Ronald immidiatly stated that he didn't call me incompetent but Jay told him that he basically did. (I have done two evacuations at this point) I grabbed my coat and went outside. 



A little flash forward to the future as I heard from Jay after I left, Ronald had to lead a partial evacutation he send out the entire building, froze up and didn't do anything. The second one, I had evening shift there and he didn't tell me it happend, its not like I have to check every alarm door in the building if its properly closed. So I got everything from the receptionist who told me that Ronald just crossed his arms and and stood there, and when 'A' asked him what they should do, he told her to figure it out herself. 



I spoke with 'A' later, told her that I got my briefing from the receptionist, Ronald didn't find it noteworthy, she told me that it was a bizarre situation. 



Ronald as a guy aside from his stench, personality, fake laugh, defensive behaviour and anything mentioned above as an example. He is a charmer; people fall for it somehow. This guy is weaponized incompetence incarnate, but actually incompetent. With everything he would say. ""Oh I didn't know that, we are learning togehter hurr hurr hurr.' Or we would simply say that I never told him any of that. 



So I met with my boss' boss and he said that he couldn't see any flaw in Ronald after they talked so he wasn't as bad as I descriped him. Which bit him in the ass a few weeks later when they had to have a conversation about how Ronald was fucking up so badly they needed a new guy. But the problem was, Jay already left that company for greener pastures. The only person that could train the new guy was Ronald and I quickly stated that I wouldn't do it. At that point I was already placed at a new company where I was having fun, and just returned from my holiday to Japan. 1 month of pure bliss 10/10 reccomend. 



But before blocking his phone number he called my on my personal phone number, which I do not know how he got it. Blamed another security guy that the phone was locked he needed the PUK code. (he didn't know what it was, i told him.) Who knows those codes from the top of their head anyway so I told him he had to talk to F our IT guy. 



There where two people with F as their first letter, a kind old dutch lady at the reception and a dutch-turkish man our IT guy. And the name was obviously a turkish name, I had my phone on speaker so my mom could listen. I had to shout the name 14 times through the phone becauce he constantly replied with the receptionists name which doesn't even sound like the name I mentioned. I hung up on him, blocked him and my mom said. 'I understand now' 



Fast forward to 5/11/2025 I had a cancer check up and met with my favourite coworker there. Chatted a bit but leave before meeting anyone else cauce I hate answering 100 of the same question. I did see Ronald during the lunch security checkpoint duty, on his phone. He didn't notice I was in or out as I passed him. 



That really ends the ballad of Ronald, I do hear some lore once or twice down the grapevine of how frustrating that location has become and how useless he is. Everytime it brings me joy. Oh, and I was declared cancer-free. Let's keep up this one-year streak.

It came to me that I won’t be able to force my brain to shut down, won’t be able to make my brain to drift off, because any time it does I’m realising what it is trying to do. It all now seem mental but I’ve got fixated on this and it took me 12 months to get rid of that fixation. The problem didn’t exist on weekends and holidays, only if I had to wake up early the next day. From the start I knew the worst thing I could do is get myself addicted to sleep meds. I took half a pill of zopiclone 3 times a week, and the remaining days I maybe had 2-3 hours. I followed all the advice I’ve seen: sleep hygiene, no coffee, exercise, journal, breathing techniques, went on 4 hypnosis sessions, hours of reassuring myself that YES I CAN SLEEP!! Nothing fucking worked. In the meantime I started to treat my anxiety, which was the problem the whole time. I should’ve know that the anxiety was the cause of the sleep problems and not the other way around.I didn’t take proper meds, however I tried various supplements and psychobiotics. Don’t know exactly what helped me, but it all just started to get better. A few weeks ago I’ve read an interview with a guy who is a sleep couch and he said something that stuck in my mind, that all sleep hygiene, no device, cold room, breathing exercises and all these sort of things is just bullshit. The only thing that works is to accept it’s not the end of the world if you have a sleepless  night, and not force yourself to sleep. Accept that you are going through a difficult period but it will pass. It may take a month or a year like in my case but it will end. I remember the horrors I went through on the nights I didn’t sleep, I started to have catastrophic thinking, imagining the worst things. That my life will just be like that forever. But it wasn’t true, and it was just a long, difficult chapter in my life. Sorry for a long post, and fingers crossed for you all. ",2,1764415072.0,insomnia,1,1.0,False

1p9mjhx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p9mjhx,I was today years old when I realized that my favorite star is actually Jupiter,"When I was a kid, I used to be fascinated by this one star because it was the brightest among all the stars I could see.

Each night, I would gaze at it through my window while lying in bed until I dozed off.

Many years later, one night as I sat on my balcony sipping a cup of coffee, my eyes caught sight of the same star. In that moment, I was instantly transported back to my childhood days.

The very next moment, I decided to figure out exactly which star I was looking at. So I started investigating and learned that its name is Menkar, from the constellation Cetus.

I was thrilled to finally know the identity of my favorite star, until today, when I was walking on my terrace at night and spotted it again. My curiosity surged once more, so I downloaded an app called SkyView Lite from the App Store (not sponsored). It basically tells you which celestial body you’re looking at if you point your camera toward it. To my surprise, it turned out to be Jupiter. 😭

I felt so stupid after that. I was like, how come I didn’t know it’s literally a planet in our solar system, and that too the biggest one? 😭

But hey, everybody *stars* somewhere (pun intended). At least I still have the enthusiasm to explore different celestial bodies.

I’ll try to keep this short and sweet.

Symptoms that started around 8 months ago:
 
-cloudy and slightly foamy urine almost every other day
-frequent urination that is very high in volume some days 
-a dull ache in pubic area and sometimes one side of perineum
-ache or dull stinging in bladder 
-dull but sharp pain near belly button 
-a tight or constricted feeling in urethra 
- lots of urine dribbling out after using the bathroom 
-weak hesitant stream at times 

I got every test in the book:

-Urinalysis 
-Urine culture 
-Semen culture 
-abdominal ct scan 
-bladder and transrectal ultrasound
-CBC w/ auto differential
-full blood work with egfr and creatinine/bun

Everything looked fine so urologist diagnosed me with cpps or pelvic floor dysfuntion, and recommended pelvic floor therapy.

What concerns me is the cloudy and foamy urine and having certain days where I urinate almost every 30 minutes for several hours and it isn’t just a little bit every time it’s a volume of at least 150ml every time. 
What also concerns me is I don’t drink any coffee, juice or anything that would overstimulate my bladder and often times when I have days where I’m peeing all day I have clear colorless urine even though I am not over-hydrating. 

What has everyone else’s experience been like and do you recommend a nephrologist or any further testing?

[https://youtu.be/85iYMiPjlOA?si=HbMOSFVWWKnExIoF](https://youtu.be/85iYMiPjlOA?si=HbMOSFVWWKnExIoF)

I am in Koln.

Due to heavy bookings for an international conference in Dusseldorf during the week,  even a hotel the size of Inter Continental can​ only offer me ​a one night​ stay.

' I am sorry, we are fully booked. 

' We are offering you our spare room to maintain our goodwill with your German business associate who phoned us about offering you a room.'

I decided to take a train from Bremen for a reason.

There is no direct flight between Düsseldorf and ​Koln because ​both cities in Germany are ​a mere 21 miles (34 km)​ apart.

​' Yes, large parts of the German autobahn network​ are world famous for not     hav​ing a general speed limit, ​but there is a recommended speed and mandatory limits​.

​' And once you get within the city limits you will get bogged down by increased traffic. 

' Take the high-speed ​train which takes around 19-21 minutes.​' 

My German associate had earlier informed me to go straight to ​Koln Central Station ​where they have reserved a room for me.

I had followed ​and been fascinated by the developments of  German​y's railway​s which cut through the country ​like a spine.

I had always wanted to experience taking it when I reach Europe.

Hitler, ​at the height of the Nazi rule,  used the German railway network as a crucial war machine for military logistics, transporting troops and supplies across Europe​. ​

The Nazi regime​ built a vast railway network as a tool to further their ambitions​.

​​It wasn't only a transport system, used for regular transport but also​ used as specialized trains, such as flak trains for air defense and Hitler's own mobile headquarters, which was equipped with advanced security.

​Today it is the longest ​and most extensive in Europe. 

It features a high-speed network, significant electrification, and serves as a major European hub for both passenger and freight transport. 

 Following my hurried meeting in the hotel coffee house as suggested by our buyer from  Dusseldorf, I took the one hour train journey  to Koln​.

 ​It was also so I can see more of Germany's countryside before my next round of meetings in Koln.

​But I had arrived in Koln​ at almost the stroke of midnight from Dortmund at the train stati​on.

​With neither staff, nor kitchen service still available to service my order for dinner for the night, I was left to satisfy my hunger by what was delivered.

A plate of rice, which had been hastily mixed with cooked curry paste, and a piece of fried chicken, which the kitchen passed for my order of chicken curry.

It is certainly far from the chicken curry rice that I am used to have and which led me to ordering it by name.

But as they say, in the middle of the night, beggars cannot be choosers....

Since summer I wanted to see them live in Warsaw but I was too broke to buy tickets. Fortunately, three weeks before the show my financial situation became stable and train tickets in Poland became super cheap so I bought the tickets. I went into deep dive into their discography to hype myself before the concert and now I can’t stop listening to heir music.

I listen to them whenever I can. I fall asleep with Leaving Meaning playing on my phone. I woke up, made a coffee, smoked a cigarette and I’m listening to Leaving Meaning again to start off my day. 

I listen to them during work, commute, when I’m at home. I do it whenever I can. EVERY song from every album since Soundtracks for the Blind till Birthing PERFECT. After listening to any song, say The Beggar Lover (Three) I could simply start again and be as happy as the first time. Then I look at all those album covers, To Be Kind, Beggar etc. and my brain is fuzzy and happy because I know how beautiful and complete are all of these hours of music and I want to listen to all of it all the time. 

That might be an addiction but it does not affect my life (social, romantic etc.) negatively. No band ever has made me so happy all the time, it’s incredible. 

The Warsaw show was magnificent but unfortunately I had toleave during A Little GodIn My Hands bc last train to my hometown was at 22:50 and I had work in the morning ",15,1764414811.0,swans,11,1.0,False

When the internet was simple… no rules, no pressure, no fancy apps. Just a nickname, a few strangers, and pure, easy conversation.

Those cyber café days… slow net, Orkut scraps, Yahoo Messenger, random chats with people you’d never meet again. Everything felt lighter, more honest.

Out of that nostalgia, I ended up making a small chatroom more like a tiny café corner on the internet. Very simple. No login, no history, nothing stored. Just a nickname and your message. Whatever you say exists only while you’re there, then it just disappears.

You can chat with strangers and make new friends… or create your own little circle and talk with your buddies. It’s fun, quiet, and private good for a peaceful chat with someone special or some silly banter with your group.

Nothing big, nothing modern, just something I built because I genuinely miss that older internet vibe when things felt human.

Being a Brit and owning a kettle, for 20+ years I have made coffee from instant coffee out of a jar, added boiling water, sugar, milk, done. I was always confused by how coffee was made in American sitcoms (they just have a jug of black water on the counter). 'Wtf is that why do they not have a kettle?' I thought.

Because I drink coffee pretty much all day, my partner has convinced me to get us a proper coffee maker like I see in American shows, you just add a filter and the ground coffee beans and it boils the water and filters it into a big round jug, supposed to hold up to ten cups.

I'm thinking great, I can just make one big pot in the morning and come back to it all day. So I fill up the pot with about eight cups worth of coffee, have my first coffee (it tasted great). I come back to it an hour or so later ready for my next one, I'm looking for the reheat button on the machine (obviously I am going to re-boil the coffee because its gone cold). There is no button. Read instructions trying to find out how to do it, no mention of it at all. All it says is it will keep the pot warm for half hour automatically. Well that is great but how do I reheat it after half an hour? There is no way to re-boil the coffee without adding more water and therefore more coffee.

Do some research online, thinking maybe I just got a cheap machine that is missing this obviously essential function. People tell me to re-boil it on a stove or in the microwave. Is this what people do? That seems absurd, why would a machine that makes and stores large quantities of coffee not be able to reheat it? You cannot just make one cup of coffee either, it recommends I add enough grounds to make at least four for best quality. But it can only keep it warm for half an hour. Am I expected to drink four coffees in half an hour?

Genevieve's Story 1

Hailey Hayes stood before me in the living room of the Alpha's mansion, her hand resting protectively over her slightly swollen belly. Her eyes held a challenge, burning with arrogance.

""If you know what's good for you, you'll leave the Pack on your own. Alpha Preston loves me, not you, you barren, useless Omega.""

My wolf bristled at the insult, pacing restlessly in my mind. She wanted to bare her teeth, to tear into this insolent she-wolf who dared to challenge a Luna.

But I forced her down. I had spent years suppressing my aura, hiding my Lycan bloodline to fit into Preston's world.

""I've heard the name Hailey before,"" I said calmly, though my wolf growled low in my chest.

She was a rogue Preston had picked up half a year ago. He claimed she was a pitiful stray with potential, hiring her as an assistant in the Pack administration.

Rumors had swirled through the mind-links of the pack members, but I had trusted the mate bond. I trusted Preston's wolf.

I never expected a rogue to walk into the Alpha's mansion and demand the Luna's position.

""A common rogue doesn't become a Luna just by leaving the wilds,"" I said, my voice cold.

She wasn't worthy of being considered a rival.

I didn't bother arguing. Instead, I opened the mind-link.

""Alpha Preston. Come home.""

I severed the link and looked at Hailey.""Preston will be here any minute. Let him make his choice before the Moon Goddess. If he chooses you, I'll walk away. How about that?""

""Heh,"" she sneered.""I gave you a chance for a graceful exit, but you just had to humiliate yourself. Fine. Just wait until the Alpha gets back. Don't come crying to me when you become a rogue.""

I offered a small smile, keeping my thoughts to myself.

Half an hour later, the heavy oak door slammed open. Preston walked in, his Alpha aura flaring with irritation.

Hailey turned to him immediately, her voice dripping with syrup.""Preston,"" she purred, clinging to his arm.""She said if you choose me, she'll walk away. Just tell her, who do you pick?""

I turned my gaze to Preston. I trusted our history. Thirteen years of companionship.

I knew exactly what his choice would be.

But in the very next moment, Preston threw a document onto the coffee table.

""Just sign the rejection papers,"" he said coldly.

The smile on my face froze. My heart skipped a beat, and then plummeted.

""Rejection?"" I whispered.

""I, Alpha Preston Vance, reject you, Genevieve , as my mate and Luna,"" he stated, his voice devoid of emotion.

The pain of the broken bond snapped through me like a physical whip. My wolf let out a high-pitched whine of agony, curling into a ball in the back of my mind.

I looked at the papers. It wasn't just a rejection; it was an expulsion order.

""You expect me to leave the Pack with nothing?"" I asked, my voice trembling.""After everything I've done for this Pack?""

""You betray our mate bond, then you want to keep all the assets?"" I asked, disbelief coloring my tone.""Preston, do you think I'm a pushover?""

Hailey smirked, leaning into him.""What, suddenly you're an independent she-wolf? For years you've eaten Preston's food, lived in the Alpha's mansion. Now you want to split assets? Don't you have any shame?""

""Did anyone ask you, rogue?"" I snapped.

""Preston!"" Hailey whined.""She's being mean to me! Kick her out!""

Preston's hand caressed Hailey's cheek, a gesture once reserved for me. My stomach churned.

He looked at me with cold, empty eyes.""Hailey is right. You are a barren Omega. The Pack needs an heir. As for the years I supported you, I won't demand repayment. Just sign the agreement and leave my Pack.""

Bullshit facts.

My gaze locked onto his.""Swear on your wolf and repeat those words.""

""We're done, Genevieve . Sign it.""

Rage surged, hot and blinding.

I snatched the papers, crumpled them into a ball, and hurled them at his face.""Oh, we're finished alright. But you're the one who will walk away with nothing.""

My wolf stood up, shaking off the pain, ready for war.

""My lawyer—and the Council—will be in touch.""

I spun on my heel, refusing to let them see the tears threatening to fall.

Just as I reached the door, a voice boomed from the hallway.""Preston, what in the Moon Goddess's name are you playing at?""

2

My mother-in-law, the former Luna, stood there. She clasped my hand firmly.""Don't you worry, Genevieve , I'll sort this out for you.""

She tugged me back into the room.

I was still reeling from the rejection, the emptiness in my chest where the bond used to be. But I had to consider her feelings. Her health was fragile; I had spent three years using secret, special medicine from the Royal Pack to nurse her back to health.

I sank back into the chair.

She poured me a cup of herbal tea, her hands shaking.""Sweetheart,"" she said,""I won't let Preston banish you.""

She turned to glare at Preston and Hailey.""Have you forgotten who took care of me when I was dying? It was Genevieve . Without her care, my wolf would have faded long ago.""

I hadn't cried when Preston rejected me, but hearing her defense brought tears to my eyes. My wolf whimpered, feeling a flicker of hope.

""Mom, how are we going to register the pup?"" Preston asked, ignoring her sentiment.

A pup? An Alpha Heir?

My brow furrowed. Hailey placed a hand on her stomach, smiling victoriously.

A child had always been the sore spot between us. We had seen countless healers, only to be told I was the problem. I had swallowed that lie to protect his ego, knowing my Lycan blood was just too strong for his weak seed.

I stood there in stunned silence, when my mother-in-law pulled my hand again.""Genevieve , you're sensible.""

She wiped away my tears.""How about this? You accept the rejection papers. But don't worry, you won't have to leave the Alpha's mansion.""

""Once Hailey has the pup, you can help raise it. You know my wolf is too weak to care for an Alpha pup, and I wouldn't trust a rogue like her with my grandchild.""

""The healers say you are nurturing. You can stay as a servant. You'll do an excellent job raising this child.""

I froze.

I yanked my hand out of hers. A wave of nausea washed over me.

It was a trap. A perfectly orchestrated performance.

They wanted to reject me as Luna but keep me as an unpaid nanny. They wanted to enslave me to raise the child of my mate's betrayal.

Ha.

I stood up, facing Preston.""I'm giving you three days. Return the assets I brought to this Pack. If you insist on leaving me with nothing, I'll destroy the Pack.""

""Genevieve , don't be ungrateful,"" Preston growled.""My mother just spoke up for you.""

His mother's face hardened instantly.""What will you live on if you leave? You are a mate-less Omega. Do you think you can survive as a rogue?""

""Given Preston's status, he needs a breeder. Hailey is a hero for carrying the heir. She doesn't mind you staying to serve, so what is the fuss?""

Me? Making a fuss?

There was no point wasting breath. I turned to walk away.

""Stop right there,"" Hailey's voice cut through the air.""Do you know what it means to have the rug pulled out?""

She smirked.""Preston has already transferred the Pack's liquid assets to my name. And he just took out a massive loan from the Council Bank. If you want to split assets, all you'll get is debt.""

""Are you sure you want to divide everything?""

Preston pulled out another document.""I wasn't going to burden you. But if you want a 50/50 split, you leave as a debtor. You'll be a rogue with nothing but debt.""

What a brilliant maneuver.

I fixed my gaze on Preston.""Scheme all you want,"" I spat.""I'm giving you exactly three days. Find a way to get those assets back. If you don't, three days from now will be the start of your despair.""

""Just a stay-at-home Omega, lost in a fantasy,"" Hailey yelled.

A stay-at-home Omega?

I turned back to Preston, my eyes flashing with a purple hue he failed to notice.

""I've been home for three years because I was saving your mother's life. Have you forgotten who I really am?""

3

""Who is she supposed to be?"" Hailey clung to Preston's arm. Her scent was sickly sweet, choking my wolf.

""Preston, baby, I hear delusional Omegas tend to live in their heads. So tell me, what grand title has she cooked up for herself?""

Preston gazed at Hailey, his eyes soft with an indulgence that made my stomach turn.

""Just what you said,"" he replied smoothly.""A stay-at-home Omega. A mate without a purpose.""

I gave Preston a long, hard look. My inner wolf paced anxiously, growling low in my throat, but I forced her into submission.

Turning on my heel, I left.

Tomorrow was the quarterly Pack Council meeting.

That's when I would make Preston remember exactly who I was.

First thing the next morning, I arrived at the Pack Council Hall.

By 9:30 AM, the various Elders began to trickle in.

Three years. I had served this Pack for three years.

But the way these Elders looked at me had definitely changed. Their gazes were cold, dismissive, treating me like an invisible rogue.

It seemed they had all forgotten who had secured the alliances. Who had single-handedly put the Ashen Pack on a fast track to roaring success.

Soon enough, Preston arrived.

He came with Hailey. Preston's expression tightened for a split second when he saw me, but it smoothed out just as fast.

Hailey, on the other hand, shot me a cold look. She stopped beside me and snapped.

""Move.""

The seating in the Council Hall was a matter of strict hierarchy. That seat—the Luna's chair—was undeniably mine.

I flicked my gaze to Hailey.""Who are you to be here? A rogue has no right to attend a Council meeting. Get out.""

""Lost your mate, so now you're trying to throw a fit at the Hall?""

Hailey draped her hands over the back of the chair, smirking.""Elders, why don't you all enlighten her? Tell her exactly who I am and if I'm qualified to be at this meeting.""

Preston looked at me, a glint of mockery swimming in the depths of his eyes.

""Ms. Hayes is the Pack's Acting Luna,"" he drawled.""I believe she is perfectly qualified to attend.""

Hailey looked down at me, a smirk playing on her lips.""Now you know my position. But what about you? What gives you the right to sit in that chair?""

I stared at Preston, my voice clipped.""Since you've explained why Hailey is here, why don't you explain my presence? I am the bonded Luna.""

But Preston offered no explanation.""This is the Pack Hall, not our den. This isn't the place for your drama. Leave, now.""

""After three years… have you all truly forgotten who I am?""

My gaze swept over the other Elders.

A tense silence fell over the room. Preston met my gaze, his eyes cold.""If you don't leave, I'll call the Enforcers.""

""So, Hailey, a rogue, can attend, but I, the Luna, can't?""

""Oh, you mean that?"" Hailey chuckled, a cruel, knowing sound.""I guess Preston forgot to tell you. Two years ago, because of your inability to produce an heir, the Council voted to strip you of your Luna rank.""

She leaned in, her voice a low whisper against my ear.

""Yesterday, you wanted to play the Luna card, didn't you? Too bad… you're not even a ranked wolf anymore. And even if you were, Preston gave you that position. Did you honestly think you were someone important?""

""Now, go slink away with your tail between your legs.""

I glared at Preston.""I was stripped of my rank? Without me even knowing?""

""Enforcers!"" Preston didn't even acknowledge me, just called out.

He pointed at me.""Get her out.""

The Enforcers stepped forward, their massive frames blocking the light. My wolf snarled, ready to rip throats, but I rose instantly.

""I'll walk out myself.""

As I reached the door, I turned back to Preston.""How the Pack really took off, how we landed one alliance after another… it seems you've conveniently forgotten.""

Preston shot a glance at the Enforcers, and they closed in on me.

I caught the flicker of avoidance in Preston's eyes. He hadn't forgotten.

It was just because of Hailey that he was denying everything I'd ever been to him.

I stared at him, my voice colder than ice.""I hear the Pack is hosting a Banquet for the Alpha Alliance tomorrow. Trying to build Hailey's reputation, are we?""

Preston's expression turned frigid.""Don't you dare make a scene, or you'll only look pathetic.""

I retorted, my voice laced with ice,""Oh, we'll see who truly makes a spectacle of themselves.""

Hailey sneered.""Genevieve , Preston might have tolerated you, but I certainly won't. If you actually dare to show your face tomorrow, I'll personally make sure the Enforcers throw you into the dungeons. But I doubt you'll have the guts.""

Don't dare?

I didn't say another word. Yesterday, I'd forced him to choose, and I'd been made a fool of.

Today, at the Council Hall, I was made a fool of once more.

Twice was enough.

There wouldn't be a third.

Both times I'd been humiliated because Preston held the title of Alpha. He controlled every narrative.

Tomorrow, that wouldn't be the case.

Reaching the edge of the territory, I looked back at the scattered estates and cabins rising in tiers toward the Alpha's mansion.

It was as if he'd changed the moment this Pack became prosperous.

Then let you… revert to the weak, struggling Alpha you once were.

I pulled out my phone—a secure line I hadn't used in years—and dialed.

""Father, he rejected me.""

""What? What did you say?""

A surprised, then delighted, voice echoed from the other end. It was the Lycan King.

""Preston rejected me. I accepted his rejection. I'm coming home.""

""That's wonderful, truly wonderful! You've finally come to your senses.""

""It's not just that I've come to my senses, Dad. It's that I've been utterly mistreated.""

My parents, the Royal Lycans, had always been against my mating with Preston. He was a standard wolf, a complete mismatch in bloodline.

But I'd insisted on being with him. My parents, furious, had cut me off.

Later, using my own resources, I helped Preston build his Pack.

My parents finally relented, saying they'd accept Preston—if he could give them a grand-pup.

But then… it turned out Preston was defective. That revelation only fueled their resentment.

During that time, to break through their economic siege, I hunted day and night. I exhausted my wolf, practically spitting blood.

""Sweetheart, tell me everything. I'm listening,"" Dad said, his voice hardening.

""At tomorrow night's Alliance Banquet, I'm going to make sure Preston is utterly destroyed.""

""Consider it done.""

I hung up, exhaling a long, slow breath.

I'd treasured this bond, but the strain it put on my relationship with my true Pack had always left a heavy shadow.

Today, that shadow finally lifted.

""When I loved you, you were the most precious thing in my life.""

""But now? What the hell are you even?""

I gave the Pack one last look before driving away.

The next evening at seven, I pulled up to the Grand Regency Hotel in the neutral zone.

I'd just stepped out of my car when Preston's SUV pulled up.

He and Hailey stepped out, both dressed in lavish furs.

Seeing me, Hailey latched onto Preston's arm, her gaze sweeping over me.

""After leaving the Pack, don't you have a single piece of clothing with some actual class? You came here dressed like a rogue? Are you just dead set on embarrassing yourself?""

I shot her a dismissive glance, my eyes finally landing on Preston.

""Maybe you should teach her about high society customs. She doesn't even recognize Royal Silk. Best not bring her out if she's just going to embarrass herself—and you.""

""Royal Silk?"" Hailey's expression hardened.""Preston, she's definitely been stealing Pack funds. We're going to get that back too.""

Preston gently squeezed her hand.""We will. We'll make sure her true colors are revealed. An Omega will always remain an Omega.""

Hailey lifted her chin imperiously.""Hear that, ugly duckling?""

I dismissed the two of them and walked straight into the hotel.

""Genevieve , it's been a while.""

""Genevieve , we've missed you so much these past years.""

Inside the hotel, several Alpha partners approached to greet me. They sensed something different—my aura was no longer suppressed.

Hailey's expression tightened as she watched. She started to step forward.

Preston caught her arm.""Hold on. I'll officially announce her banishment later. And… the evidence of her Feral Sickness will be played as well.""

A small smile touched Hailey's lips.""Thank you for doing all this for me.""

""It's what I'm supposed to do. It's proof of my love for you.""

Exchanging smiles and whispers, the two made their way to the stage.

The buzz in the room quieted as they ascended. Preston took the microphone.

""Thank you all for joining us tonight,"" he began.""I have a few important announcements to make.""

""First, I'd like to introduce Ms. Hailey here beside me.""

""She is my new Luna, and she will be taking full charge of the Pack's Expansion Project moving forward.""

The Expansion Project—my project. I'd conceived it years ago, spent countless hours negotiating.

Now, finally, it was time to reap the rewards, and Preston was handing all of it over to Hailey.

I watched the scene unfold with a cold, almost detached indifference. Hailey, basking in her newfound glory, looked utterly smug.

A dark anticipation simmered within me. My wolf paced excitedly in my mind.

I couldn't wait to see the looks on the faces of that treacherous pair when I finally unleashed my aura.

In the dim light of the hall, my eyes began to glow.

Not the gold of an Alpha. Not the blue of a Beta.

But a deep, royal purple.

The hallmark of the Lycan bloodline.

When the internet was simple… no rules, no pressure, no fancy apps. Just a nickname, a few strangers, and pure, easy conversation.

Those cyber café days… slow net, Orkut scraps, Yahoo Messenger, random chats with people you’d never meet again. Everything felt lighter, more honest.

Out of that nostalgia, I ended up making a small chatroom more like a tiny café corner on the internet. Very simple. No login, no history, nothing stored. Just a nickname and your message. Whatever you say exists only while you’re there, then it just disappears.

You can chat with strangers and make new friends… or create your own little circle and talk with your buddies. It’s fun, quiet, and private good for a peaceful chat with someone special or some silly banter with your group.

Nothing big, nothing modern, just something I built because I genuinely miss that older internet vibe when things felt human.

Genevieve's Story 1

Hailey Hayes stood before me in the living room of the Alpha's mansion, her hand resting protectively over her slightly swollen belly. Her eyes held a challenge, burning with arrogance.

""If you know what's good for you, you'll leave the Pack on your own. Alpha Preston loves me, not you, you barren, useless Omega.""

My wolf bristled at the insult, pacing restlessly in my mind. She wanted to bare her teeth, to tear into this insolent she-wolf who dared to challenge a Luna.

But I forced her down. I had spent years suppressing my aura, hiding my Lycan bloodline to fit into Preston's world.

""I've heard the name Hailey before,"" I said calmly, though my wolf growled low in my chest.

She was a rogue Preston had picked up half a year ago. He claimed she was a pitiful stray with potential, hiring her as an assistant in the Pack administration.

Rumors had swirled through the mind-links of the pack members, but I had trusted the mate bond. I trusted Preston's wolf.

I never expected a rogue to walk into the Alpha's mansion and demand the Luna's position.

""A common rogue doesn't become a Luna just by leaving the wilds,"" I said, my voice cold.

She wasn't worthy of being considered a rival.

I didn't bother arguing. Instead, I opened the mind-link.

""Alpha Preston. Come home.""

I severed the link and looked at Hailey.""Preston will be here any minute. Let him make his choice before the Moon Goddess. If he chooses you, I'll walk away. How about that?""

""Heh,"" she sneered.""I gave you a chance for a graceful exit, but you just had to humiliate yourself. Fine. Just wait until the Alpha gets back. Don't come crying to me when you become a rogue.""

I offered a small smile, keeping my thoughts to myself.

Half an hour later, the heavy oak door slammed open. Preston walked in, his Alpha aura flaring with irritation.

Hailey turned to him immediately, her voice dripping with syrup.""Preston,"" she purred, clinging to his arm.""She said if you choose me, she'll walk away. Just tell her, who do you pick?""

I turned my gaze to Preston. I trusted our history. Thirteen years of companionship.

I knew exactly what his choice would be.

But in the very next moment, Preston threw a document onto the coffee table.

""Just sign the rejection papers,"" he said coldly.

The smile on my face froze. My heart skipped a beat, and then plummeted.

""Rejection?"" I whispered.

""I, Alpha Preston Vance, reject you, Genevieve , as my mate and Luna,"" he stated, his voice devoid of emotion.

The pain of the broken bond snapped through me like a physical whip. My wolf let out a high-pitched whine of agony, curling into a ball in the back of my mind.

I looked at the papers. It wasn't just a rejection; it was an expulsion order.

""You expect me to leave the Pack with nothing?"" I asked, my voice trembling.""After everything I've done for this Pack?""

""You betray our mate bond, then you want to keep all the assets?"" I asked, disbelief coloring my tone.""Preston, do you think I'm a pushover?""

Hailey smirked, leaning into him.""What, suddenly you're an independent she-wolf? For years you've eaten Preston's food, lived in the Alpha's mansion. Now you want to split assets? Don't you have any shame?""

""Did anyone ask you, rogue?"" I snapped.

""Preston!"" Hailey whined.""She's being mean to me! Kick her out!""

Preston's hand caressed Hailey's cheek, a gesture once reserved for me. My stomach churned.

He looked at me with cold, empty eyes.""Hailey is right. You are a barren Omega. The Pack needs an heir. As for the years I supported you, I won't demand repayment. Just sign the agreement and leave my Pack.""

Bullshit facts.

My gaze locked onto his.""Swear on your wolf and repeat those words.""

""We're done, Genevieve . Sign it.""

Rage surged, hot and blinding.

I snatched the papers, crumpled them into a ball, and hurled them at his face.""Oh, we're finished alright. But you're the one who will walk away with nothing.""

My wolf stood up, shaking off the pain, ready for war.

""My lawyer—and the Council—will be in touch.""

I spun on my heel, refusing to let them see the tears threatening to fall.

Just as I reached the door, a voice boomed from the hallway.""Preston, what in the Moon Goddess's name are you playing at?""

2

My mother-in-law, the former Luna, stood there. She clasped my hand firmly.""Don't you worry, Genevieve , I'll sort this out for you.""

She tugged me back into the room.

I was still reeling from the rejection, the emptiness in my chest where the bond used to be. But I had to consider her feelings. Her health was fragile; I had spent three years using secret, special medicine from the Royal Pack to nurse her back to health.

I sank back into the chair.

She poured me a cup of herbal tea, her hands shaking.""Sweetheart,"" she said,""I won't let Preston banish you.""

She turned to glare at Preston and Hailey.""Have you forgotten who took care of me when I was dying? It was Genevieve . Without her care, my wolf would have faded long ago.""

I hadn't cried when Preston rejected me, but hearing her defense brought tears to my eyes. My wolf whimpered, feeling a flicker of hope.

""Mom, how are we going to register the pup?"" Preston asked, ignoring her sentiment.

A pup? An Alpha Heir?

My brow furrowed. Hailey placed a hand on her stomach, smiling victoriously.

A child had always been the sore spot between us. We had seen countless healers, only to be told I was the problem. I had swallowed that lie to protect his ego, knowing my Lycan blood was just too strong for his weak seed.

I stood there in stunned silence, when my mother-in-law pulled my hand again.""Genevieve , you're sensible.""

She wiped away my tears.""How about this? You accept the rejection papers. But don't worry, you won't have to leave the Alpha's mansion.""

""Once Hailey has the pup, you can help raise it. You know my wolf is too weak to care for an Alpha pup, and I wouldn't trust a rogue like her with my grandchild.""

""The healers say you are nurturing. You can stay as a servant. You'll do an excellent job raising this child.""

I froze.

I yanked my hand out of hers. A wave of nausea washed over me.

It was a trap. A perfectly orchestrated performance.

They wanted to reject me as Luna but keep me as an unpaid nanny. They wanted to enslave me to raise the child of my mate's betrayal.

Ha.

I stood up, facing Preston.""I'm giving you three days. Return the assets I brought to this Pack. If you insist on leaving me with nothing, I'll destroy the Pack.""

""Genevieve , don't be ungrateful,"" Preston growled.""My mother just spoke up for you.""

His mother's face hardened instantly.""What will you live on if you leave? You are a mate-less Omega. Do you think you can survive as a rogue?""

""Given Preston's status, he needs a breeder. Hailey is a hero for carrying the heir. She doesn't mind you staying to serve, so what is the fuss?""

Me? Making a fuss?

There was no point wasting breath. I turned to walk away.

""Stop right there,"" Hailey's voice cut through the air.""Do you know what it means to have the rug pulled out?""

She smirked.""Preston has already transferred the Pack's liquid assets to my name. And he just took out a massive loan from the Council Bank. If you want to split assets, all you'll get is debt.""

""Are you sure you want to divide everything?""

Preston pulled out another document.""I wasn't going to burden you. But if you want a 50/50 split, you leave as a debtor. You'll be a rogue with nothing but debt.""

What a brilliant maneuver.

I fixed my gaze on Preston.""Scheme all you want,"" I spat.""I'm giving you exactly three days. Find a way to get those assets back. If you don't, three days from now will be the start of your despair.""

""Just a stay-at-home Omega, lost in a fantasy,"" Hailey yelled.

A stay-at-home Omega?

I turned back to Preston, my eyes flashing with a purple hue he failed to notice.

""I've been home for three years because I was saving your mother's life. Have you forgotten who I really am?""

3

""Who is she supposed to be?"" Hailey clung to Preston's arm. Her scent was sickly sweet, choking my wolf.

""Preston, baby, I hear delusional Omegas tend to live in their heads. So tell me, what grand title has she cooked up for herself?""

Preston gazed at Hailey, his eyes soft with an indulgence that made my stomach turn.

""Just what you said,"" he replied smoothly.""A stay-at-home Omega. A mate without a purpose.""

I gave Preston a long, hard look. My inner wolf paced anxiously, growling low in my throat, but I forced her into submission.

Turning on my heel, I left.

Tomorrow was the quarterly Pack Council meeting.

That's when I would make Preston remember exactly who I was.

First thing the next morning, I arrived at the Pack Council Hall.

By 9:30 AM, the various Elders began to trickle in.

Three years. I had served this Pack for three years.

But the way these Elders looked at me had definitely changed. Their gazes were cold, dismissive, treating me like an invisible rogue.

It seemed they had all forgotten who had secured the alliances. Who had single-handedly put the Ashen Pack on a fast track to roaring success.

Soon enough, Preston arrived.

He came with Hailey. Preston's expression tightened for a split second when he saw me, but it smoothed out just as fast.

Hailey, on the other hand, shot me a cold look. She stopped beside me and snapped.

""Move.""

The seating in the Council Hall was a matter of strict hierarchy. That seat—the Luna's chair—was undeniably mine.

I flicked my gaze to Hailey.""Who are you to be here? A rogue has no right to attend a Council meeting. Get out.""

""Lost your mate, so now you're trying to throw a fit at the Hall?""

Hailey draped her hands over the back of the chair, smirking.""Elders, why don't you all enlighten her? Tell her exactly who I am and if I'm qualified to be at this meeting.""

Preston looked at me, a glint of mockery swimming in the depths of his eyes.

""Ms. Hayes is the Pack's Acting Luna,"" he drawled.""I believe she is perfectly qualified to attend.""

Hailey looked down at me, a smirk playing on her lips.""Now you know my position. But what about you? What gives you the right to sit in that chair?""

But Preston offered no explanation.""This is the Pack Hall, not our den. This isn't the place for your drama. Leave, now.""

""After three years… have you all truly forgotten who I am?""

My gaze swept over the other Elders.

A tense silence fell over the room. Preston met my gaze, his eyes cold.""If you don't leave, I'll call the Enforcers.""

""So, Hailey, a rogue, can attend, but I, the Luna, can't?""

""Oh, you mean that?"" Hailey chuckled, a cruel, knowing sound.""I guess Preston forgot to tell you. Two years ago, because of your inability to produce an heir, the Council voted to strip you of your Luna rank.""

You were there when life was slow, and things mattered more

while not mattering at all, when there was no framework for how

to be or what to do and so we just lived, spending

our nights at a coffee shop talking and smoking cigarettes

laughing, always fucking laughing, all of us, all together, all the time.

the fleeting eternalness of youth, a mindset which can't be accessed again, 

and the love and light of being surrounded by real people, 

those who know you and let you be who you want to be. 

We separate and then talk about the lives we've led. The 

parallel existences, so different and absolutely the same. Two kids, husbands and wives.

For some context, I have BPD, and in the past, me and my mom have gotten into some very ugly fights because of it. I never did anything with the intention to hurt her or demean her, but it seemes no matter what i do or say, she assumes the worst out of me.

I (F20) still live with my parents for school and work. Today was supposed to be my Second day of work.

I woke up this morning, and went downstairs because i thought it was around time to leave the house. Upon coming downstairs, my mom is sitting at the coffee table. I asked her ehat time it was, and she replied in a nasty tone—""eleven..?"" 

I thought nothing of it, but i left it alone because the night before she seemed to be in a mood. I had only slept about 3 hours the night before because i have horrible insomnia, so i was tired and out of it. When we got in the car, i asked her if she was irritated and if everything was okay. 

She said she was fine in the most monotone way ever and i shrugged it off and said ok. I put my esrbuds in, and we were off. The dilemma happens when she drops me off. She asked me if i could get to work from there, and i said yeah. I grab my bag, put my earbud in, and get out the car to walk into my job. then she *calls* me, telling me ""Dont you ever slam my door again.""

I was so utterly confused, and i told her that i didnt slam her door intentionally. She gives me a half ass response that made it clear she didnt believe it, and that was the end of the call. This is not the first time shes misinterpeted me and assuming im doing things spitefully or deliberately.

I get upset at this repeated cycle and 15 seconda after she hangs up, i text her.

After these messages, she pulls up to my job and starts literally SCREAMING at me in the parking lot. She called me an ingrate, a dirty bitch, Ungrateful, and every other nasty name in the book, and said that if i wasnt her child she would beat my fucking ass.

Then she told me she was sick of dealing with me and my attitude and that i (alongside everyone else in the family) use her as an emotional punching bag. She essentially made it clear that i make her life miserable and that she no longer wants to deal with me. She told me to stop calling her mom and start calling her by her name.

her main issue was that she was under the impression i gave her an attitude when i never did,  i even tried explaining to her that i didnt know i had closed the door that hard and my earbuds were in so i wasnt aware. She completely denied and said she didnt care and she was sick of my shit.

I wanted to share the **evidence-based habits** that made the biggest difference for me, in case they help someone else too.



# 1. I Stopped Eating After 8 PM

I didn’t follow a strict fasting routine at first, but I made one simple rule:

➡️ **No food after 8 PM.**

This cut down on mindless snacking and helped regulate my hunger hormones.

**Keywords:** night-time cravings, intermittent fasting, belly fat reduction, weight loss routine



# 2. I Switched to a High-Protein Breakfast

Instead of sugary cereals or tea + biscuits, I ate:

* Eggs
* Oats with protein
* Greek yogurt
* Smoothies with peanut butter

It kept me full for hours.

**Keywords:** high-protein breakfast, fat-burning foods, healthy breakfast for weight loss



# 3. I Walked 30–45 Minutes Daily

Nothing crazy. No gym membership.  
Just consistent **low-intensity cardio**.

Walking helped me burn fat without tiring myself out.

**Keywords:** walking for weight loss, low-intensity cardio, natural fat burning



# 4. I Replaced Sugary Drinks With Water or Black Coffee

This alone cut 300–500 calories per day.

Now I drink:

* Water
* Green tea
* Black coffee

**Keywords:** reduce sugar intake, weight loss hacks, fast weight loss tips

Read also [**30 Day Meal Plan For Weight Loss >>**](http://www.goslimplan.fit#aff=dayasevana)

# 5. I Tracked My Food 5 Days a Week (Not 7)

Tracking 7 days a week made me stressed.  
Tracking only on weekdays helped me:  
✔ Stay mindful  
✔ Avoid overeating  
✔ Still enjoy weekends

**Keywords:** calorie deficit, mindful eating, sustainable weight loss strategies



# BONUS: A Simple High-Fiber Daily Rule

I made sure every meal had at least **1 high-fiber food**:

* Vegetables
* Beans
* Fruits
* Whole grains

Fiber improves digestion, reduces bloating, and keeps you full.

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl ( cue the song ) and I’m looking to make a friend , someone to text about everything , nothing and all the dumbassery in-between . 

 Here are some random things about me to see if we have a click : 
I’m 21 years old. I have ADHD (read: I find something new to fixate on every other week). I enjoy reading (currently reading Zomerhuis met zwembad), journaling, baking ,crafting , long walks in nature.

I don’t really enjoy watching movies but I love series (currently watching Lang Leve de Liefde and KOTH). I enjoy online crossword puzzles, going down YouTube rabbit holes and reading random Wikipedia articles. I speak 3 languages and I’m slowly learning a 4th. 

**Things to expect if we become friends**  
• Good morning messages (might not be sent in the morning)  
• Random song recommendations  
• Someone that you can annoy at any time of the day  
• Virtual coffee dates (or whatever drink floats your boat)

Does that sound pretty cool to you ? If yes text me ;) if no text me anyways ;))

After years of trying diets, I finally found a simple, science-backed approach that helped me **lose 22 lbs in 8 weeks** — without starving or spending hours in the gym.

These tips include **proven weight loss strategies**, **fat-burning foods**, and **metabolism-boosting habits** that anyone can follow.



# 1. Calorie Deficit, But the Smart Way

The biggest game-changer was tracking my calories without obsessing. I used the **80/20 rule**:

* 80% whole foods
* 20% flexible eating

This helped reduce binges and made the plan sustainable.

**Keywords:** calorie deficit, healthy weight loss, sustainable weight loss, weight loss tips



# 2. High-Protein, High-Fiber Meals

Protein kept me full longer, which naturally controlled cravings. My daily staples were:

* Eggs
* Greek yogurt
* Lean chicken
* Beans & lentils
* Oats

Fiber-rich foods kept digestion smooth and helped reduce bloating.

**Keywords:** high-protein diet, fat burning foods, weight loss foods, reduce belly fat



# 3. Walking 8,000–10,000 Steps Daily

I didn't do intense workouts. Just walking.  
Walking is extremely underrated — it boosts calorie burn, improves metabolism, and reduces stress.

**Keywords:** easy weight loss, walking for weight loss, natural fat burning



# 4. Strength Training Twice a Week

I added simple resistance workouts (dumbbells + bodyweight). This helped increase lean muscle, which boosted my metabolism even at rest.

**Keywords:** metabolism booster, strength training weight loss, build lean muscle



# 5. Drinking More Water + No Liquid Calories

Just by cutting soda, fruit juices, sugary coffees → I saved hundreds of calories daily.  
Water also helped reduce cravings.

**Keywords:** weight loss hacks, lose weight fast naturally



# 6. Intermittent Fasting 16:8 (Optional But Effective)

Not for everyone — but it helped me control night-time snacking and improved my energy levels.

**Keywords:** intermittent fasting, fasting for weight loss, 16:8 diet



# 7. Weekly Progress Photos Instead of the Scale

The scale lies! Photos and measurements showed real progress even when weight plateaued.

# Final Thoughts

Weight loss isn’t magic — it’s **consistency + the right habits**.  
If you want to lose weight in a healthy and sustainable way, focus on:

* Whole foods
* Walking
* Strength training

You don’t need extreme diets. You need a plan you can follow long-term.

He's fourth year while I'm in first year. He majors in flight vehicle while I major in mechanical engineering. He's wonderful but incredibly difficult to shop for because he either already has everything he needs or is very particular about what he uses.

We' re currently studying in china. we agreed to a budget of around 200 RMB which is around 28 USD. 

Here’s the breakdown:

The ""Hard No"" List (Things he definitely won't use):

1. Alcohol: Doesn't drink.
2. Strong Scents: Can't stand perfumes, colognes, or strong-smelling candles.
3. Bags & Wallets: Refuses to carry any kind of bag or purse.
4. Accessories: No jewelry, watches, hats, etc.
5. Skincare/Bodycare: Won't use lotions, creams, sprays, or anything like that. He hates the feeling of them. 
6. Basic Clothes: He has a ton and is very specific about his simple style.

we've only known each other for three months and dated for only two months. so this what I've known of him. 
What He LOVES (But Already Has a Lot Of):

1. Badminton: He's an avid player, but his rackets, shoes, and gear are already high-end and he has plenty. I'm lost here.
2. Drawing: He's very talented! But he already has a full set of professional pencils, sketchbooks, etc.
3. Gundam/Gunpla: He builds the models, but he has a huge collection and I have no idea which ones he has or needs.
4. Plushies & Keychains: He has a massive collection from ""you buy I buy"" with friends, so more of the same feels unoriginal.
5. Coffee: He's a big coffee lover, he's got a lot of types of coffee beans in his dorm, and already has a lot of barista equipment.
6. He loves Pokémon and anime

The current person I was allocated to said when it’s 6 weeks until my new job, to apply as I will be prioritised, and it’s now almost 5 weeks away so applied yesterday, got the call today (out of nowhere, no email, no warning at all, genuinely surprised me and only answered as I thought it was my prev guy) but luckily managed to rebook it to Weds.

Anyway, he had my old ADHD award up and said they won’t fund the majority of it anymore as he said it’s considered productivity tools and can be funded by the employer as reasonable adjustments, so the main 2 items out of everything I got that I use every day at work (I leave them at work) will not be funded. These two items are the Remarkable and the noise-cancelling headphones (and laptop but as I’m continuing to work for the NHS, I assume they can give me a work laptop instead like my current job has).

**I am so confused, what’s the point of access to work if they no longer fund the reasonable adjustments hardware?**

I cannot keep the ones I currently have as work wants to re-allocate them to other employees, and those 2 items can be expensive and we all know the NHS is really tightening their budgets (my current role stopped us claiming petty cash to buy biscuits for the groups we run, and wanted to stop tea/coffee but managers pushed back) so I have no idea if my new role has the budget for potentially £800 worth of items for me.

Anyone know anything about these changes?

I am so confused and frustrated, I feel like most of the things my assessor recommended in my most recent workplace assessment (which it sounded like he didn’t want to recommend me for, even though my other advisor said I will need one for the new role) and I should have occupational health review me first, which they have and recommended me re-referring to AtW… sorry for the long post, just don’t understand the point of AtW if not to fund work-related reasonable adjustments.

  
edit: i did see the changes on the gov website (https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work) but mostly just confused and a bit annoyed, i knew they were cracking down on this stuff, alongside PIP/etc, but didn’t realise it was this much!

I’m 23M, I was arranged with someone I deeply loved and struggled for. It was the perfect love story. No haraam nothing bad. I met her at a volunteering event when I was 18 and she was 18 too. We both clicked very quickly, and the following weekend I went to her house and asked for her hand. Her father and mother loved me a lot. We talked, my parents talked and then we scheduled the engagement. But due to some reasons and circumstances on her side we had to postpone it by a year. So instead of 19, I’d be marrying her when I would be 20-21. I didn’t think too much. We talked, we didn’t meet up though unless her brother or my sister came along. Then when we started approaching the date, they tried to push it again by a year. So I was like okay that’s fine. I’ll graduate and I’ll have a job by then. So I started focusing on my studies. And one day out of no where we decided to go to a coffee shop, like me and my friends. And there she was, with another guy. Much older than me, mid 20s atleast. And my heart dropped. Tears instantly started flowing down my face. And I just stood there staring and thinking what I have been doing with my life. I felt like a loser. So like any idiot in love, I was enraged, and walked up to the table and asked what is going on. And not a flinch on her face. Not a single reaction of her being atleast ashamed of herself. Instead she looked me dead in the eye and said, “I found someone better, but couldn’t tell you bc I didn’t want to hurt you” and tht line shattered me into so many ungatherable pieces

Not to mention the previous night we met and talked. She acted like she was so happy that everything was going smoothly and what not. She use to compliment me a lot on everything I did. I thought she was genuinely into me.

But regardless obvsly we broke the marriage and she got married the following week. 2 years later, she is pregnant now with a kid. And I’m here still crying over her. At 4am, thinking if I should ever get married or not.

The sexual urges that leads to haraam are gone for me. Like not gone but like so controllable that it’s not a problem for me, and it because I imagine her face everytime I get these urges and the urge just vanishes, like it was never there yk, I’m instantly filled with pain and wanting to be with her, hold her hand, stare at her as she just spaces out. But anyways, it’s not leading me to any haraam whatsoever, so this kinda gives me more of a reason to not get married.

I have 2 dairies filled with the stuff we did together, 2 books filled with Urdu poetry that I wrote myself. I don’t think I’ll ever get over her. And over the betrayal. Not to mention I doubt it would be fair for a girl to marry someone whose heart belongs to someone else.

I genuinely don’t know what to do, how to get over her, and how to reconsider the possibility of marriage again.",7,1764413265.0,MuslimLounge,6,0.89,False

My Interests:

Good food & cosy nights in

Live music, musicals, concerts

Being a theatre kid at heart I will sing loud and proud, I didn't say I was good. You are warned. 

Cleaning (yes, I find it immensely satisfying...no, I don’t know why...trauma, possibly.)

A simple life: morning coffee, rainy-day movies, [cliché]long walks, little market stalls, crystals, shells, & big belly chuckles, no like if I'm not getting the hiccups, having an asthma attack, or snorting like a pig, what even are you doing?

The Vibe:
I’m not looking for luxury [but I wouldn't shy away from it.] I will run from drama & chaos, because although I'm all for chaotic fun, the serious kind is just too taxing emotionally, and I'm spent. I’m looking for someone who enjoys a softer, more simpler life. Someone who thinks a perfect night in is admiring a tidy home, unwinding to a great playlist, a chunk of meat braising in the oven, and a rich & warm cuddle once the shoes are kicked off.

I noticed that the tape is slightly unflush with the tampers surface and it forms the tiniest groove around the sides, we are talking about not even half a millimeter is is truly minuscule but still visible, I wonder if that might lead the water to go faster around the sides, what do you guys think?",2,1764412829.0,LaPavoniLovers,0,1.0,False

There was a notification from her friend saying she couldn't imagine having to raise a kid without help from her partner, and how mine must be so overwhelmed. I know it was wrong to read it and I've no excuse for that.

Before i got a job, we alternated who had the baby overnight and slept in different rooms to ensure the other got a full night's sleep. To be honest, i did 90% of the work while I was looking for work, everyone would comment about her only holding the baby when people were over for appearances. There was a lot of arguments over her not spending enough time with him.

Now that im working, she has him 5 nights a week and I take him 2 nights that correspond with my days off. Before I go to work, I wash and sterilise bottles. Other errands like driving around for formula (i had to search 8 shops the other morning) or i dropped her sister off at the train station. Things that would impact my capability to spend time with the baby. She also doesn't leave her room in the morning so i dont want to disturb her or the baby in case theyre sleeping. When I come home from work, I make food for the both of us, play with the baby for a bit or feed him and burp him.

On my most recent day off. I woke up early, I went out and got her flowers, food and made her a coffee when I got back, she complained I forgot the bottles. We went out and I got her a piercing she wanted for ages, another coffee and then I went out to get shopping, while in the shop I got her 3 pairs of shoes and a dress (she was saying her feet hurt and needed new shoes. The dress was just a surprise gift) She complained I forgot her pineapple juice. I ran her a bath and took the baby for a while, fed him. Played with him etc. When I tried to take him for the night she said no, despite being tired.

I was raised by a single mother and my visitation with my dad was all him focused on how to try get back with her (hes schizophrenic too). Im doing what I can, when i can. But now it doesn't feel like its enough. 

For extra context, im the only one who drives out of us so its me who has to go do the shopping or trips to get stuff. Am I doing enough? How can I improve?",1,1764412818.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

I chatted with her until she goes on her ventures since she is a businesswoman, and as for me who waits tinadtad ko sya ng sweet messages para kahit paano it can brighted her mood, I want her to feel that I am waiting for her, to feel na may uuwian sya kahit malayo kami.

A comic book page, in a **classic 5-panel layout**: **1 wide horizontal panel on top**, **4 equal square panels aligned in a row at the bottom**. Clean white gutters. Thick, clean black ink outlines. Flat, readable comic coloring with a balanced minimal palette: sky blue, park grass green, neutral warm skin tones, everyday clothing colors, and one bright red accent for comedic focus. Characters are highly expressive, with simple backgrounds. Text is hand-lettered in a classic comic font. The humor is coherent, grounded, and punchline-driven, with panel imagery escalating logically.



# Panel 1 (TOP – wide)

**Scene**: A man stands in a sunny park, arms out like a documentary host. A tiny furious Chihuahua is held up in his hand like a wildlife specimen.  
**Text (man speech bubble, top-left quadrant, pointed at man)**:  
“Behold! The rare *Chihuahua Angrius*…”  
**Text (small label below dog like a name tag, centered under dog)**:  
“Danger: 4 lbs”



# Panel 2 (BOTTOM 1 – square, far left)

**Scene**: The dog hits the ground with a tiny dust *poof*, paws spread like it just superhero-landed, face pure fury.  
**Text (large dog speech bubble, centered, pointed at dog)**:  
“FEAR ME, GRASS!”



# Panel 3 (BOTTOM 2 – square, middle left)

**Scene**: The man crouches calmly pointing at the perfectly harmless lawn. The dog continues screaming at it.  
**Text (man bubble, bottom center, pointed at man)**:  
“Jeff. It’s literally just… grass.”



# Panel 4 (BOTTOM 3 – square, middle right)

**Scene**: Dramatic zoom-in on Jeff the Chihuahua, face filling 40% of the panel, eyes shaking with determination, little tail visible behind him like a stiff antenna.  
**Text (dog bubble, top-center of panel, jagged border, pointed at dog)**:  
“It knows what it did.”



# Panel 5 (BOTTOM 4 – square, far right)

**Scene**: Jeff now sits in a tiny red donut dog-bed on the grass, blanket tucked, still staring at the lawn suspiciously. The man stands above him sipping coffee, unsurprised.  
**Text (man bubble, top-right of panel, pointed at man)**:  
“He declared war on the lawn again.”  
**Text (dog bubble, bottom-center, small, pointed at Jeff)**:  
“And I’ll do it tomorrow.”



**GLOBAL STYLE NOTES (short, clean, matching content)**

* Visual focus on characters’ expressions and poses.
* Flat colors, minimal soft shadow only under characters.
* No random props or unrelated text.
* Every line visually corresponds exactly to what is shown.



LAST IMAGE PROMPT :  
*A comic book page with 5 panels: one large panel on top, four smaller panels below. Colorful, cartoony style, bright and cheerful colors. Funny theme: a clumsy wizard trying to make a sandwich.*

**Panel descriptions and text placement:**

1. **Top large panel:** Wizard in a messy kitchen, magic wand in hand, trying to levitate bread slices. Bread floats in the air chaotically. *Text (top left corner of panel, comic-style font):* “Behold! The perfect magical sandwich!”
2. **Bottom left panel:** Wizard concentrates hard, sparks fly from wand, bread spinning uncontrollably. *Text (above bread, small speech bubble):* “Steady…”
3. **Bottom middle-left panel:** Bread hits ceiling, cheese flies. Wizard looks panicked. *Text (center, small burst bubble):* “Oops!”
4. **Bottom middle-right panel:** Wizard covered in ingredients, sandwich exploded everywhere. *Text (top right corner, jagged bubble):* “Maybe too much magic…”
5. **Bottom right panel:** Cat sitting calmly, eating the only intact piece of sandwich. Wizard sighs. *Text (small bubble near cat):* “I guess you’re the master now.”

If there was something messy within a 50-meter radius, it would find her.

Even after the Seattle coffee incident on the train — which Sophie enthusiastically reenacted by holding her Starbucks cup over her head like a waterfall — Lila still couldn’t escape her meme legacy.

Her Mud Queen pose was now so famous that people had started using it as a reaction image.
Someone even printed it on a T-shirt.

And worst of all… her best friends thought it was hilarious.

A Calm Saturday… for Now

The weekend sun was warm, the sky was clear, and Lila dressed in her cutest autumn outfit — a cozy orange crop sweater and olive-green pants.
She hoped, begged, and prayed the universe would give her one normal day.

She met Tina McGrath near the park fountain. Tina waved wildly.
“Lila! My favorite Mud Queen!”
“Don’t you start,” Lila warned, pointing. “I’m on probation from disaster.”

Tina laughed and looped her arm through Lila’s.
“Relax! Today is wholesome. Cozy. Pumpkin-spice-flavored serenity!”

They walked through the golden park paths, leaves crunching under their shoes, talking about everything that had happened the past couple of weeks.

The paintball incident.
The smoothie incident.
The pumpkin soup incident.
The nacho incident.
The dog show paw-print incident.
The train coffee incident.

By now, the list was long enough to qualify as an academic course.

Tina nudged her. “Look, Lila… sometimes the messiest moments make the best memories.”
“I agree,” Lila said. “But I would also like memories that don’t require stain remover.”

They both laughed, and for a moment, the chaos queen felt at peace.

Anna Arrives from Oxford

As they reached the park’s center, a tall woman with a suitcase waved at them.

“Tina! Lila!”

It was Anna McGrath, Tina’s older sister — elegant, brilliant, freshly arrived after months studying in Oxford.

She hugged both of them.
“Good to see you two again! Especially you, Lila — the internet’s favorite hazard magnet.”
“Oh no,” Lila groaned. “Even Oxford knows?!”
Anna nodded proudly. “One of my professors showed your nacho video in a lecture on virality.”

Tina nearly fell over laughing.

Anna clapped her hands. “Anyway! They’re having autumn games this afternoon. Sack races, leaf-pile dives, pumpkin bowling — let’s go!”

Lila blinked.
“Pumpkin… bowling?”
“Don’t worry,” Tina whispered. “What’s the worst that can happen?”

Lila’s eye twitched.


---

The Autumn Games Begin

The park was alive with color and excitement — orange tents, cinnamon donuts, caramel apples, children running, leaves swirling in the breeze.

Anna dragged them straight to the Leaf Pile Arena.

“First game: Leaf Toss!” the host shouted. “Gather as many leaves into your bucket as possible!”

Tina and Anna sprinted ahead, leaving Lila with no choice but to follow.

But the moment Lila crouched to scoop leaves—
a sudden gust of wind whooshed through the park.

Every leaf within ten meters flew directly at her like they were magnetized to her sweater.

“NO— NO NO NOOO—!”

Leaves plastered her belly, her sweater, her neck, even her hair.
A kid pointed. “LOOK! IT’S THE MUD QUEEN!”
Lila groaned. “Not again…”

Anna held her stomach laughing.
“This is art. Stay like that!”

Tina already had her phone out.
“Okay, Lila — pose!”

Lila lifted her sweater just a bit, revealing her leaf-covered belly.
The leaves stuck to her skin like she was the forest floor itself.
Dirt from the pile clung to the sweat on her stomach.
A perfect autumn mess.

She closed her eyes dramatically, stuck her tongue out, and raised her arms in the iconic Mud Queen pose.

The park crowd cheered.
Someone shouted, “Do it again!”
Someone else yelled, “LEAF QUEEN!”

Lila sighed. “I give up. Just bury me in compost already.”


---

The Pumpkin Bowling Crisis

But the day wasn’t over.

Anna insisted they try pumpkin bowling next.

Tina chose the smallest pumpkin.
Anna chose the heaviest one.
Lila chose the medium one, whispering, “Please don’t betray me.”

Of course, her pumpkin betrayed her.

Just as she pulled her arm back to roll it, a toddler ran past chasing bubbles and bumped her elbow.

The pumpkin flew straight upward.

“HEADS!” Anna yelled.

The pumpkin arced beautifully…

…then landed in the nearby leaf pile, exploded into stringy orange mush, and coated Lila’s shoes.

Tina whispered, “At least it wasn’t your belly this time.”

The universe heard her.
The universe did not approve.

A stray dog — covered in pumpkin remains — ran excitedly toward Lila and shook itself dry.
Pumpkin strings flew everywhere.

Splatter.
Splat.
Splotch.

All over Lila’s belly. Again.

She didn’t even hesitate.
She just raised her arms, stuck out her tongue, and accepted her fate.

“Behold,” Lila said flatly, “my destiny.”

Peace at Sunset

When the games were over, the three walked slowly through the orange glow of the evening.

Lila shook off the last leaf stuck to her sweater.
Anna winked. “You know, Lila… I think the world loves you because you’re unfiltered. Real. Hilarious, even when you don’t try.”
Tina nodded. “Exactly. You’re the most fun person to be around.”

Lila blushed.
“Thanks… I guess if life keeps throwing messes at me, at least I’ve got good people to laugh with.”

They hugged.

Then a squirrel dropped a leaf directly onto Lila’s head.

All three froze.
Then burst out laughing.

Lila threw her arms up one more time.
“THE MUD QUEEN REIGNS SUPREME!!”

And the park echoed with their laughter as the sun dipped below the trees.

1p9lp09,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1p9lp09/is_this_ocd_or_just_regular_behavior/,Is this OCD or just regular behavior?,"

I'm 24f, 5'1, 120lbs. Diagnosed with anxiety, but no other mental health conditions. I've never been in therapy.



I have some routines and habits that sometimes make me wonder if I possibly have OCD, but I feel like I don't quite meet the criteria.

  
This is my typical morning routine:

\-before I get out of bed, I do the wordle (this is random, and if I break this habit I think things would be okay)

  
\-wake up very early (4ish). when im on vacation/staying with friends i try to wake up about 2 hours before everyone else so i can finish my routine in peace before they wake up

  
\-get dressed, brush teeth. drink water and coffee. read at least 50 pages of a book.

  
\-poop (this is the hardest part because it's not directly in my control). most of the time it happens after coffee though.

  
\-when all that's done i can continue on with the rest of my day

  
I think that's a solid and healthy routine. The problem is that if something happens to limit me things get very hard. In the vacation example, I will spend a lot of mental energy worrying about where my coffee is going to come from (is there a coffee machine? how doss it work? do i need to buy coffee? will i wake everyone else up when i make the coffee? what if someone else gets to it before me?) until it resolves itself.

  
I also struggle sometimes with cleanliness, health, and eating. But again, those are all good things. But I do get super anxious about random things, like yesterday I felt a bump in my mouth and worried for at least an hour that I had an std despite not having had unprotected sex ever in my life, or sex period in several months.

  
I like to check and recheck things. I'm currently looking for a new job so spend about 2 hours a day looking at different jobs, even though I have several months before my current contract even expires.

  
I also constantly seek reassurance. Whether it's by Googling things, asking people their opinions on things, or things like this very post.

  
I was once on a weekend trip with some friends. We were planning to take a bus ride back on the last day, and busses weren't running. I spent about an hour confirming that there were no busses, because we were expecting there to be. We had to stay an extra day and I started panicking because I hadn't planned for an extra day, didn't know if I had clean clothes, wasn't prepared to do my morning routine away from home again, etc. I started ranting about the lack of busses and my friend nicely suggested I might have ocd- she said I reminded her of a relative she has who is diagnosed with it.

  
Just curious if I have a healthy amount of neuroticism or if this might be OCD.",1,1764411902.0,AskDocs,3,1.0,False
