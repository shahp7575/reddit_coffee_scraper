The relay circuit in the photo is connected to a pressurestat which responds to pressure in a coffee machine boiler so when pressure goes beyond certain level it breaks the circuit and vice versa. Unfortunately, I splashed some water on the machine and it started tripping. When I disconnect the relay circuit and connect the relevant wires the machine works fine therefore I belive the problem is in the circuit. Let alone everything it trips it burns the resistor in that circuit. I have replaced the resistor but the result is the same. Now, my elimination process stoped on the capacitor. Therefore I need your help with testing and identifying it so I could replace. Thank you everyone.",1,1754172623.0,AskElectronics,0,1.0,False

I was wondering if anyone else struggles with this. I’m genuinely so scared of men to death like I’m not joking. Yesterday i saw a man standing beside the restroom literally just drinking his coffee and I ran away. Like actually my heart started beating so fast. A man said hi to me today and again my heart started beating so fast. I feel like this is stupid. Yes, you obviously have to be cautious around men, but mine is awful.

1mg2o5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mg2o5k/trying_to_decide_in_best_longterm_water_solution/,Trying to decide in best long-term water solution for new machine (Synchronika 2),"Just yesterday we got a new ECM Synchronika 2, upgraded from our Breville Infuser. In the interest of wanting to take care of the machine, I’ve been doing a lot of research about water. For our Breville, since it uses a filter installed in the tank, I’d just use water from our Brita filter and then do a descale cycle at the same time as running a clean. I realize that Brita doesn’t actively remove calcium or reduce hardness, yet it drastically reduces the amount of scaling in our kettle so I’m a bit perplexed by that…

We will be using the machine with the built in tank, not plumbed in. The tap water is very quite hard where we live (but tastes great as a result). I want something that will be kind to my machine but also make for great tasting coffee, while also being as low maintenance/hassle as possible. Based on my research, these seem to be the best options but I’m not sure which one to go with:

  
**1. Bilt Oscar 150 water softening pouches (or similar)**

I’ve ordered a couple of these to use right away, but not sure if it’s what I’ll stick with. 

PROS:
- relatively low cost
- As close to “set it and forget it” as possible. Only need to be changed once every several months, and I can program the machine to remind me.

CONS:
- might not be the best option taste-wise? It says it removes magnesium, which I understand doesn’t contribute to limescale and also has positive impacts on coffee flavour

**2. “AquaAroma Crema” filter cartridges**

PROS:
- The water tank in the Synchronika is designed to be able to attach these filters specifically, so I assume it’s a method that ECM believes is good for the machine.

CONS:
- More expensive than the Oscar pouches, and need to be changed much more frequently (every couple months vs. once or twice a year)
- perhaps also removes minerals that have positive impacts on taste?

**3. Make my own distilled water and remineralize with baking soda + epsom salts**

PROS:
- very low cost after the initial purchase of a small volume distiller
- customizable to taste
- could use the water for brewed coffee as well

CONS:
- highest maintenance option. Have to be constantly making more distilled water, adding minerals, etc. 
- Would take a few years to make the initial cost of a distiller worth it vs. option 1 or 2
- provides yet another variable to obsess over as I learn to get the best espresso possible from our new machine.

**4. Just use our great tasting tap water and descale monthly as part of regular cleaning and maintenance**

PROS:
- virtually no cost
- likely great tasting coffee

CONS:
- Worry about potential damage to machine, either from limescale or corrosive descaling solution

**Options I’m NOT willing to consider:**
- buying bottled/distilled water (cost, plastic waste)
- specially formulated “coffee water” packs such as Third Wave Water, etc. (high cost)

Any advice on which route to take is much appreciated, as well as any other considerations specific to the Synchronika or E-61 machines. 

Thanks!

In the past, whenever I set out on a journey, it felt like an *experience*. Long walks through unfamiliar villages, the rhythmic clatter of train tracks beneath me, conversations with strangers over shared routes. I would find my favorite routes, charming old inns, scenic side paths. I even used to collect train tickets and keep journals. I *loved* the journey.

Nowadays, when I go anywhere, I see people and I just assume people drove there. And I get kind of sad.

I keep thinking, “oh they probably just took the freeway,” and suddenly the place feels less magical. Like it wasn’t *earned*. Like they didn’t suffer a little for it, or get lost, or meet a goat herder along the way. It just... lacks texture.

Car travel feels like cheating. And nobody respects a cheater. You push a pedal and zoom past a hundred stories without ever noticing them. No blistered feet, no train delays, no soul.

My Instagram feed is full of these shiny pictures of cool places, but it all looks like fast food to me now. Just snapshots taken after someone parked ten feet away and walked in with their iced coffee. None of it feels *real*.

What do you guys think? Is this just a me problem? Anyone else feel like we lost something when we stopped arriving somewhere tired, dusty, and a little wiser?

Caveats: I’m not anti-car, of course. If someone *uses* a car but still puts in some legwork, maybe hikes the last mile or wanders off the road a bit, that still counts. It’s just... I want to believe someone *lived* their journey, not just *visited* it.",1,1754172370.0,aiwars,0,1.0,False

But the worst part?
Connor Arison. My new stepbrother.

CHAPTER 1
LARA
PROM NIGHT
The silky deep purple slip dress barely counted as a dress.
The slit was so high I couldn't even wear underwear.
I tugged it down for the hundredth time, shivering slightly in the cool night air as Chad dragged me toward the side of the building.
We barely made it past the Prom King and Queen announcement before he pulled me outside, hands all over me, his too-sweet breath hot against my neck.
""Chad, stop,"" I muttered, shoving at his chest.
He didn't listen.
Instead, his massive linebacker body pressed me against the wall, his fingers digging into my hip a little too hard and his erection digging into my lower stomach.
Fuck, this oaf was going to crush me.
What the hell was I thinking saying yes to prom with him?
Then again, I only did it because I knew Connor would hate it.
Connor.
My dearest stepbrother.
Chad's hands wandered, and my patience snapped.
I swung my purse over his head. ""Get off, asshole! Not happening!""
He barely flinched.
""Come on, baby,"" Chad slurred, trying again. Was he drunk? At prom!?
I struggled, shoving at him harder this time, but he wouldn't move—
Until suddenly, he was gone.
Ripped off me like a rag doll.
I stumbled forward, breath shaky, my hands gripping my dress as I looked up—
And found Connor standing where Chad had just been.
His jaw was tight, his storm-gray eyes locked onto mine for a brief second before shifting back to Chad.
My pulse spiked.
Connor was calm. Cold. And that was a bad sign.
He wasn't the kind of guy to explode in anger.
No—he was the kind to dismantle you piece by piece and make you beg for the mercy he'd never give.
""I didn't need saving,"" I muttered, tugging my dress down again.
""Clearly,"" he said flatly.
Chad groaned from the ground, slowly pushing himself up.
""What the fuck, man? That's my date!"" Chad whined, swaying slightly.
Connor barely glanced at him before gripping his collar and hauling him up like he weighed nothing.
Chad might be a linebacker, but Connor had generational strength.
I bet every single man in his family looked like he did.
Tall, lean, and dangerous. That calm, mysterious exterior.
Tanned skin. Dark hair. Those goddamn gray eyes that could either burn you alive or freeze your blood in an instant.
And the worst part?
He had to be my stepbrother, or at least that's what I was told about 7 months ago when my life...my mother...it all ended.
Connor barely glanced at him before gripping his collar and hauling him up like he weighed nothing.
I watched—frozen—as Chad tried to throw a punch, but Connor dodged with ease, like it was a dance, and landed his own—a quick, sharp hit to the kidney.
—Or was that the liver?
I didn't know, but either way, Chad buckled over, gasping.
""You asshole!"" he wheezed, clutching his side. ""I knew it! I told them—I told them you had some perverted crush on your stepsister, but nobody would believe me!""
The air shifted.
Connor's body went still.
And when he slowly turned his head toward Chad, something dark slid over his features.
Chad had no idea.
He should have stayed down.
I made a quick exit, heart pounding, just as I heard a grunt behind me—followed by the thud of something heavy hitting the ground.
Like a sack of potatoes.
I never really understood that phrase until now.
Shit. Shit.
I tried to run, but these strappy heels were useless.
Everything seemed to happen in slow motion—my ankle rolled, the ground was rising fast, and—
Strong arms caught me.
A low chuckle brushed against my ear, warm breath sending a shiver down my spine.
""Little dove..."" Connor murmured, holding me tight against his chest. ""Falling head over heels for your knight in shining armor?""
His voice was pure sin, deep and taunting, as if he was enjoying this too much.
I scowled. ""More like trying to escape evil..."" I shot back, trying to pull away.
But Connor didn't let go.
His arms only tightened around me.
""You don't want to go back in there, love,"" he said, voice smooth but laced with warning. ""Everyone just made up their own assumptions—and none of them look good on you.""
My stomach twisted.
He wasn't wrong.
People were already watching us, whispering about us, wondering what the hell was going on.
I let out a heavy sigh. ""Fine. Can you please just take me home?""
I looked up at him then—really looked at him.
My worst enemy.
My biggest desire.
A truth I would never, ever confess.
He just lifted me up, carried me to his black car, and set me inside like it was always meant to be this way.
Convenient.
Too convenient.
CHAPTER 2
LARA
7 MONTHS AGO - SENIOR YEAR
The day my world ended started like any other.
I let the front door slam behind me, my backpack slipping off my shoulder as I kicked off my sneakers. ""Mom?"" My voice echoed in the small apartment, but there was no answer.
I barely noticed. I was too busy grinning, gripping the folded test paper in my hands so tight the edges curled.
A hundred percent. A-plus.
Harvard was within reach—I could feel it. Senior year had started off perfect, and if I kept this up, my dream was just on the horizon. I couldn't wait to tell her. We were going to get out of this town after all!
""Mom, you are not going to believe this!"" I called, walking past the worn-out couch, the scuffed coffee table covered in old magazines and half-empty coffee mugs. The place was small—just two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a cramped kitchen—but it was ours.
She had been working extra shifts at the diner, and I knew she'd be exhausted, but I needed her to hear this.
Still nothing.
She worked the night shift and was probably napping.
I rolled my eyes, shaking my head as I walked toward the back of the apartment. ""Elaine!"" I called, jokingly using her name just to get a rise out of her. It always ticked her off when I did that.
Silence.
I turned the corner toward her bedroom, expecting to see her passed out on the bed.
But she wasn't there.
The door to the bathroom was slightly open, and I could hear the faint sound of running water.
A crease formed between my brows. ""Mom, you forgot to turn the tap off again,"" I sighed, pushing the door open the rest of the way. ""You're gonna run up the—""
The words died in my throat.
At first, I didn't understand what I was looking at.
My brain refused to process it, refused to string the details together into something that made sense.
The tub was full. Water had spilled over the edge, soaking the old tile floor. Her hand was hanging over the side, fingers pale, unmoving.
I blinked.
And blinked again.
Until—
""Mom!""
*********
The funeral was small.
A few people from the diner came—Mom's coworkers, mostly. A couple of neighbors. Some familiar faces from town, standing in the back, murmuring condolences they probably didn't mean.
Mom hadn't had many friends. She worked odd hours, kept to herself, and any energy she had left was spent on me. And now she was gone.
The church smelled like melting wax and wilting flowers. The service was brief, just like she'd wanted. She had left a will—one of the only things she'd ever been prepared for. Explicit instructions: cremation. No drawn-out ceremony. No open casket.
When the pastor handed me the vase that held my mother's ashes, my fingers tightened around the cool ceramic, but I didn't react. I hadn't cried yet. Maybe I never would.
Leslie, my best friend since kindergarten, slipped her arm through mine, grounding me as we walked out of the church. She had been the one to stay with me the past few nights, the one who held my hand at the police station when the officer gave me the official verdict.
Suicide.
I couldn't believe it.
Sure, she had been sad sometimes. She worked insane hours, and money was always tight. But my mom was strong. She wasn't the type of person who would… leave me.
Still, that was the word they used. Suicide. Case closed.
Leslie squeezed my arm when we stepped outside, where a stocky redheaded man stood waiting. I recognized him from the station. The lawyer.
He removed his hat when he saw me. ""My condolences, Miss Ford.""
I nodded, unable to form words. It all felt like a big, massive lie.
I turned to leave, but his voice followed me.
""Miss Ford! Your mother left you this in her will.""
I froze.
He held out a sealed envelope. ""Her instruction was that you read it after you graduate—not before then.""
My fingers twitched at my side, but I couldn't make myself take it. Couldn't make myself do anything.
Leslie, always the practical one, took the letter for me, murmuring a quiet ""thank you"" before leading me to her car.
Neither of us spoke on the drive back.
Home.
What a joke.
Leslie pulled up in front of my apartment building, but something made me pause.
A black SUV was parked outside.
Something about it made my stomach twist. A strange déjà vu, like I'd seen it before but couldn't place where.
And then it hit me.
Outside the church.
Further down the street.
Watching.
I shook my head, brushing the thought away. I was imagining things. I was exhausted, grief-stricken, and probably paranoid.
Right?
CHAPTER 3
LARA
The words in my biology textbook blurred together.
I was supposed to be taking notes, but how was I supposed to focus?
It had only been a week since Mom died.
A week since, my entire world collapsed in on itself.
Everything felt dull—like I was underwater, floating through a reality that wasn't my own. None of this felt real.
""Lara.""
I didn't look up.
Miss Green had a habit of calling on students randomly, but she hadn't done it to me since the funeral. And anyway, that wasn't my name.
Not exactly.
""Lara Westbrook.""
My pen stilled.
That wasn't my name.
I barely registered the shadow cast over my desk before Miss Green's voice softened. ""Lara, honey. These men are here to speak with you.""
She sounded nervous. Uncertain.
My head snapped up, and for the first time, I noticed them.
Two men in black suits stood near the door, their presence so out of place in a high school classroom that the air itself felt heavier.
There was something about them—something wrong.
I swallowed hard. ""Why?""
Miss Green fidgeted, glancing between me and the men. ""They said that your… uhm, your father is waiting for you.""
""My what?"" I breathed.
I didn't have a father.
I mean, I had one somewhere, but I didn't know him. Mom never spoke about him, and after a while, I stopped asking.
""I think you should go, honey,"" Miss Green urged.
My heart pounded as I pushed my chair back, the legs screeching against the tile. I grabbed my bag, feeling like I was walking through a fog as I approached the door.
The two men flanked me the second I stepped into the hallway, boxing me in with an unsettling, practiced ease.
Then—
""Lara!""
I turned just as Leslie shoved past the desks, her eyes wide with panic. She had barely taken two steps before one of the men stepped in front of her, blocking her path like a living wall.
""Do not approach Miss Westbrook,"" he said, his voice low and final.
Miss Westbrook?
I frowned. Who the hell was Miss Westbrook?
I didn't know what was happening.
Shoving the man aside, I shot him my best glare. ""Stop it, you big ogre. She's my best friend.""
Ignoring the way his jaw ticked, I turned back to Leslie and hugged her tight.
""I'm not going anywhere,"" I whispered. ""I'm just going to find out who the hell this man is that's claiming to be my father.""
The black SUV waiting outside the school looked too familiar.
I hesitated for a moment, glancing at the two men beside me. They didn't say a word—just waited.
A sinking feeling settled in my stomach, but I slid in any way.
The second the door shut, the locks engaged with a quiet click.
The windows were black. Not tinted—black. I couldn't see out at all.
A shiver ran down my spine.
""Okay,"" I muttered, forcing a laugh. ""This is creepy.""
Neither man reacted.
I shifted in my seat. ""So, you mentioned my father? Who is he?""
Silence.
I tried again. ""Is this some kind of mistake? Because I don't have a father.""
More silence.
""Okay, well, if this is some kidnapping plot, I feel like you should at least be telling me about the ransom—""
Nothing.
I slumped back against the leather seat with a sigh.
An hour passed.
I fidgeted, watching the passing lights through the tiniest sliver of visibility near the edge of the window.
I didn't recognize anything.
""So where are we going, anyway?"" I asked.
One of the men finally spoke. ""New York.""
I blinked.
""Wait—what?""
The SUV slowed as we neared a clearing, and I finally noticed where we were.
An airport.
""No. No, no, no,"" I stammered, my hands reaching blindly for the door. ""I've seen this movie! Let me out! Let me out right fucking now, or I'll scream!""
Neither man reacted.
Instead, the divider between the front and back seats slid up, sealing me in.
I yanked on the handles.
Nothing.
I slammed my fists against the door, panic clawing its way up my throat.
""LET ME OUT!""
I kicked. Pounded. Screamed until my throat burned.
Tears blurred my vision as the SUV rolled to a stop.
The door swung open, and sunlight blinded me.
Before I could react, one of the men reached inside, grabbing me.
I barely had time to struggle before he threw me over his shoulder like I was nothing more than a rag doll.
I kicked. Scratched.
""PUT ME DOWN, YOU PSYCHO!""
Nothing.
My screams rang through the open air, but there was no one around.
Not a single soul.
I was hauled onto the jet and strapped into a seat. My wrists were tied before I could fight back.
A sob broke free.
""What is this?"" My voice cracked. ""Who are you?""
Neither man answered.
Every time I even shifted, the big guy sitting across from me would throw me a look.
The kind of look that said:
Sit still—or lose a vital organ.
Or maybe an important body part.
So I kept my mouth shut.
But that didn't mean I wasn't scanning the space for the first possible exit.
The moment I got one, I was gone.
I glanced at the two men in black suits. Both looked like they could break bones for a living—and probably did.
""Sooo..."" I started, my voice light, casual. ""You called me Lara Westbrook.""
Neither man reacted.
I pressed on. ""Not to judge your...uh...skill set, but you do know I'm not Lara Westbrook, right?"" I let out a fake laugh. ""I'm Ford. Maybe you got the wrong g—""
""You are Lara Westbrook.""
The leaner one, with the buzz cut, cut me off. His voice was flat, unwavering.
""We don't make mistakes.""
I rolled my eyes, forcing a smirk. ""Right. Well, I have school and classes, and I have important things back at home—""
No reaction.
""You can't just kidnap me and expect me to be okay with that,"" I snapped, frustration spilling over. ""You do realize this is a felony? Or a crime? Or whatever—""
I trailed off as the big guy smirked.
A slow, cold, knowing smirk.
""Miss Westbrook,"" he said, voice low and almost amused, ""we should have been in jail a long time ago.""
My blood ran cold.
Shit.
The landing went just like the boarding—silent, controlled, and completely against my will.
I was ushered off the plane and straight into another blacked-out SUV, the kind with reinforced doors and bulletproof windows.
No way out.
The men said nothing. Just closed the door behind me.
They put my bag in the back with me and I let out a silent victory laugh and immediately started digging through it.
""Ha! Idiots…""
My fingers flew to the side pocket where I always kept my phone.
But it wasn't there.
I frowned, checking the main compartment and the front zipper, even shaking the bag out onto the seat next to me.
Nothing.
My chest tightened.
I was about to full-on panic when the divider in front of me slowly began to lower.
My stomach dropped.
Sitting in the front, in the passenger seat, was bad guy number two—Buzz Cut.
He smirked at me through the gap, holding something up between two fingers.
My phone.
""Looking for this?""
I froze, my mouth opening—but no words came out.
""We're almost there,"" he added, ignoring my frantic pleas as he raised the divider again, sealing me back in silence.
Where the hell was 'there'?
The car rolled to a stop, and the locks clicked open.
I hesitated before stepping out.
And then, I saw it.
A mansion.
No. A damn estate.
Sprawling grounds, pristine hedges, a fountain in the circular driveway—because, of course, there was a fountain. The mansion itself was three stories of glass, steel, and money, with massive floor-to-ceiling windows and an entrance so grand it looked like it belonged in a royal palace.
My stomach knotted.
This better not be my father's house.
Because if it was…
If this was where he lived—while Mom and I struggled in that dingy two-bedroom apartment…
I couldn't even finish the thought.
Kidnapper One and Two didn't wait for me to process any of it. One of them grabbed my bag, the other motioned for me to move. My legs obeyed before my brain did, carrying me through the massive double doors into a space so breathtaking I forgot to be pissed off.
The foyer was an architectural masterpiece.
White marble floors stretched across a space so wide I wasn't sure where it ended. A grand staircase curved up to the second level, its banisters made of polished black iron. A massive chandelier—easily the size of my entire bedroom back home—hung from the high ceiling, shimmering in the soft lighting.
It smelled of money and power.
And when I finally tore my eyes away from the opulence…
One and Two were gone.
But I wasn't alone.
A presence stood in front of me—one that screamed danger.
Every instinct in my body went on high alert, my pulse hammering as my eyes locked onto him.
He stood casually, hands shoved into his pockets, his white button-down slightly open at the collar. He was tall, his broad shoulders sharp beneath the expensive fabric. Jet-black hair combed back, exposing storm-gray eyes—eyes that pinned me where I stood.
I forgot how to breathe.
""Can I help you?"" he asked, his voice low, steady—unnervingly so.
I fumbled for words.
""I… uh…""
He stepped forward.
I froze.
Each slow, measured step sized me up, like a predator studying its prey. Leaning in, his lips almost touching my ear, he whispered, ""You can tell Lucien I don't need distractions,"" he said, tilting his head slightly. ""And I definitely don't need a fuck—especially not from some farm girl.""
What. The. Hell.
Before I could stop myself, my hand flew up—
CRACK.
The smack echoed through the grand entrance, my palm stinging from the impact.
His head snapped to the side, but he didn't blink.
Didn't move.
Didn't even take his hands out of his pockets.
And when he slowly turned his gaze back to me, something in his expression made my breath catch in my throat.
The slap still hung in the air between us, the sharp sting of it painted across the asshole's cheek in a blooming red mark. His jaw ticked as he ground his teeth, his storm-gray eyes locking onto mine with a look that could only be described as murderous.
But then—
""Lara.""
A deep, commanding voice cut through the tension from somewhere to the left. I didn't turn immediately, didn't dare look away from Connor, but I saw the way his expression shifted, his smirk flattening into something unreadable.
Footsteps echoed across the marble floors, steady and controlled. Then the voice spoke again, closer this time.
""Welcome.""
Finally, I turned my head.
The man approaching was tall and broad-shouldered. He was dressed in a tailored suit that fit him too perfectly to be anything but custom. His dark hair was slicked back, and there was a streak of silver at his temples. And his eyes were sharp and piercing green.
Like mine.
My stomach twisted.
Mom had blue eyes.
I had green.
He stopped just in front of me, so close I could feel the heat radiating off of him. Then, before I could step back, he pulled me into a hug.
""You're here,"" he murmured, his voice rough with something I couldn't name. ""I'm so sorry about your mother. But things will be better now. I will make it better. I promise you.""
I couldn't move. Not because of the sheer strength in his hold—though that was part of it—but because I was too stunned to react.
This man.
My father.
The man who had been nothing more than a ghost my entire life was now standing here, touching me, speaking as if he had any right to claim me as his own.
And I hated it.
Heat rushed to my face, and my throat tightened as a painful lump formed. I didn't cry—not out of sadness. No, the sting in my eyes was pure, unfiltered rage.
I shoved back, wiping my face before anything could fall.
""Look,"" I said, my voice shaking—not with fear, but fury. ""I don't know what you thought was going to happen here. We are not family. You are not my father, and you did not care about my mother. I came here because I literally had no choice. Now, I've seen you. You've seen me. Great. So if you could just book me the first flight back, that would be swell.""
His face darkened, but I wasn't done.
""I don't need anything from you,"" I continued, lifting my chin in defiance. ""And don't feel obligated to help me. I am not some long-lost daughter desperate for a reunion.""
A low chuckle distracted me, and my head snapped toward Connor.
""Not the daddy-daughter reunion you thought, huh?"" he said, lips curling into a smirk.
My blood boiled.
My eyes locked onto his, and his face went blank for a brief second before he cocked his head and looked at me with interest. ""Ought to be interesting,"" His English accent drawled, which was strange considering I was standing on American soil the last time I checked.
The smirk vanished.
A beat of silence stretched between us, thick and suffocating, before the man in the suit—Henry Westbrook—stepped back and extended a hand.
""Let's try this again,"" he said, his voice going cold. ""I'm Henry Westbrook, and you are my daughter - Lara Westbrook. Your mother died, and now you live here. There is no negotiation. There is no discussion. There is no flight back home. This is Connor - your stepbrother as it is. As you two are clearly getting along so well, I'll have Connor make sure you adequately represent the name. Dinner is this evening at 8 pm. I expect everyone. We have some things to discuss."" With that - the man who calls himself my father, walked away.
I looked over at Connor, who smirked at me before stepping forward. ""Better fall in line, love. The sooner, the better."" He whispered and caught my wrist just as I was about to give him a second slap. His fingers curled around my arm, making it feel tiny, and I just knew that if he wanted - he could snap it. ""Careful - this might become fun..."" He winked and walked off...
CHAPTER 4
LARA
The sound of soft footsteps echoed across the marble, and I turned my head just as a woman walked into view. She wore a uniform—a black dress, the kind you'd expect a cleaner to wear—but there was something warm in her face that didn't fit the cold sterility of this place.
She had short, silvery hair, neatly styled, and kind brown eyes that crinkled at the edges when she smiled.
I expected her to keep walking and go about her business, but she came straight toward me, her expression shifting the moment she got a good look at me. Her gaze dropped to the silent tears rolling down my cheeks, and she sucked in a breath before her hands fluttered up.
""Oh dear,"" she gasped, her voice full of concern. ""This is a lot, isn't it?""
I stared at her, still too stunned to react.
She tsked under her breath, shaking her head as if she were scolding someone. ""Mr. Westbrook could have handled that so much better!"" she huffed. ""What he should have said was that you have our sincere condolences about your mother, but at the same time—we are absolutely thrilled to have you with us.""
I blinked at her.
The contrast was too much. The warmth in her voice and the way she acted like this were all normal—like I was supposed to be here, supposed to belong.
I barely managed to whisper, ""They're acting like they knew about me all along…"" My throat tightened, my voice breaking. ""But I didn't even know they existed.""
Her face softened, and before I could stop myself, I wiped at my face, sniffling. ""I just... I just really want to go home,"" I admitted, my voice cracking at the last word.
The woman's expression didn't change. She took my hands in hers—warm, steady, comforting. ""Oh, my dear,"" she said gently. ""This is home now.""
I stiffened, trying to pull away, but she didn't let go. Her grip was firm but kind, like she wasn't trying to trap me—just trying to ground me.
""Believe me when I say,"" she continued, lowering her voice, ""your father won't allow you to go back. It's not safe.""
Not safe.
Safe from what?
Before I could ask, she gave my hands one last squeeze and let go. ""Come,"" she said, offering a reassuring smile. ""Let me show you your room—that will cheer you right up.""
I swallowed hard, hesitating.
This felt wrong. All of it.
I didn't know these people. I didn't know Henry Westbrook. I didn't know this mansion. And I certainly didn't know this woman standing in front of me, telling me to trust her like she was some long-lost nanny.
Still, what choice did I have? Turn and run? I somehow knew I wouldn't make it five steps past that door.
I exhaled sharply, giving a stiff nod.
""Good,"" she said, her smile widening as she turned. ""I'm Silvie, by the way—you can trust me.""
Could I?
I didn't answer. I just followed her up the winding staircase, feeling number with every step.
Silvie led me down a long hallway, past doors that looked identical except for the intricate carvings on each frame. Everything about this place screamed wealth—the thick carpets, the expensive artwork, and the chandeliers dripping from the ceiling like frozen waterfalls. It was like stepping into a museum, except I was apparently supposed to live here.
She stopped in front of a set of tall double doors and pushed them open, stepping aside so I could walk in first.
I did. And then I stopped breathing.
The room was massive. Bigger than my entire apartment back home. The walls were painted a soft cream, and the furniture matched—luxurious but not overwhelming. A four-poster bed with sheer white drapes stood against the far wall, its plush bedding arranged so perfectly it looked untouched. Floor-to-ceiling windows stretched across one entire side of the room, letting in golden afternoon light and casting long shadows over the polished hardwood floors.
I barely heard Silvie mumbling something about a control panel as she moved toward a nightstand, but I wasn't listening. My mind was stuck on one thing—space. So much space.
There was even a courtyard… or was it a balcony?
I wasn't sure, but my feet carried me toward the sliding doors, and I pushed them open, stepping onto smooth stone flooring. A gentle breeze lifted my hair, carrying the crisp scent of autumn. My gaze flicked to the right, where another set of sliding doors led to a connected room.
The curtains inside were drawn shut.
A guest room?
I took a step closer, curiosity prickling at the edges of my mind, but Silvie's voice pulled me back.
""Do you like it?"" she asked, smoothing out the bedding as if I'd already agreed to sleep here. ""If not, we can change it. Mrs. Westbrook chose this color because she thought it might be safest—she wasn't sure what you'd like.""
I turned away from the balcony, nodding absently as I scanned the room again, my thoughts scattered—until my gaze landed on something that made my entire body go still.
No.
No, that's impossible.
I barely realized I was moving, my legs carrying me forward before my mind could catch up. My hands reached out, fingers trembling as they brushed against the smooth ceramic of the vase sitting on the dresser.
I knew this vase.
I knew it because it wasn't just any vase.
It held my mother's ashes.
A choked breath left my throat, and I whirled around to face Silvie, my heart pounding.
""How?"" I rasped.
Silvie's warm brown eyes met mine, soft with understanding. ""All of your things—you'll find they're here,"" she said gently. ""The apartment is still there, of course, for the rest of the year. But Mr. Westbrook thought it best for you to finish the school year here with us, under adult supervision. You know… to make sure you keep your grades up.""
I barely heard her. My grip tightened around the vase, my mind spinning.
How did he get this?
How did he get everything?
Silvie kept talking, moving toward the walk-in closet, where she pulled open the doors to reveal rows of neatly hung clothes. ""Your clothing has been packed away, but Mrs. Westbrook took the liberty of buying a few new items. Some more… appropriate pieces, as well as your school uniform for Blackwood Academy.""
I blinked. ""Blackwood Academy?""
She nodded. ""It's one of the most prestigious private schools in New York. You'll start on Monday.""
I swallowed hard. Blackwood Academy. The name sounded expensive—
Like them.
Silvie turned back to me, her expression still gentle. ""I'd suggest wearing a dress for dinner. It's a formal occasion once a week."" She gestured toward a small button near the nightstand. ""This rings me directly should you need anything.""
I nodded numbly, still clutching the vase to my chest.
I had no idea what to say.
No idea what to think.
Everything was happening too fast.
My mother was gone.
My home was gone.
And now I was standing in a mansion, surrounded by strangers who somehow knew everything about me when I knew nothing about them.
How the hell was any of this even possible?
CHAPTER 5
LARA
The water shut off with a soft click, and I stood there for a moment, letting the last of the warmth seep into my skin. Thick and fragrant steam curled around me, carrying the scent of rain and lilies. Everything in this house smelled like luxury—like something I had never belonged to.
I ran my hands through my wet hair, wringing out the excess water before stepping onto the heated marble floor. The towel I grabbed was impossibly soft and thick, wrapping around me like a warm cocoon. The fabric grazed my bare skin as I tucked the corner in place, securing it just above my chest.
I inhaled deeply.
I could get used to this.
But just as quickly as that thought came, another crashed over it.
What the actual fuck am I doing enjoying a shower when I was technically just kidnapped by my own father?
The jarring contrast between my reality and the luxury surrounding me made my stomach twist. The silky robe hanging on the back of the door, the dozens of expensive lotions and oils lined up on the counter, and the fact that this bathroom was bigger than my entire bedroom back home.
It was wrong.
All of it.
And yet, when I stepped into my room and felt the plush carpet beneath my feet, something inside me eased.
Maybe it was exhaustion. Maybe it was denial.
Or maybe it was just that this place, despite everything, felt good.
The floor-length curtains billowed slightly from the air conditioning, but I still wanted more. I walked to the balcony doors, pressing my fingers against the cool glass before sliding them open.
Fresh air rushed in, carrying the crisp scent of rain, the after-storm breeze cooling against my damp skin. I closed my eyes for a second, breathing it in.
My hometown hardly saw rain.
Everything there was dusty and bone dry, with cracked earth and cloudless skies.
This?
This was... nice.
I leaned against the frame, staring out at the estate grounds. Even in the dim light of evening, I could see how pristine everything was—perfectly trimmed hedges, an Olympic-sized pool glistening under golden-lit sconces, and beyond that, the faint outline of the city skyline in the distance.
I exhaled, pressing my forehead to the glass.
I needed my phone.
I needed to call Leslie.
I needed to talk to someone who wasn’t a criminal or a stranger in a tailored suit claiming to be my father.
I turned, ready to search for Silvie or anyone who might know where they put my things, but then—
A thump.
My head snapped toward the room across from mine.
The curtains that had been drawn earlier were now open.
And my jaw hit the floor.
What the hell was I looking at?
My brain short-circuited, telling me to turn away, to stop looking, but my body refused to listen.
Because there—right there against the glass—was a girl.
Completely naked.
Her palms were braced on either side of the sliding door, her forehead nearly touching the glass. Her head was tilted slightly, breath misting against the surface in soft, rapid puffs.
She wasn’t just standing there.
She was pressed against it.
Held there.
And then I saw him.
Connor.
I sucked in a sharp breath, but it was swallowed by the distance between us.
He was behind her, one hand fisted in her hair, pulling her head back, exposing the curve of her throat. The other gripped her hip, fingers digging in possessively.
My stomach tightened, heat crawling up my neck before I could stop it.
I should not be watching this.
I should not be seeing this.
But I couldn’t move.
Couldn’t look away.
Not when the girl’s lips parted in a silent gasp did Connor shift behind her.
Not when Connor’s mouth brushed against the column of her neck, his dark lashes low, expression unreadable.
And especially not when—
His eyes snapped up and locked directly onto mine.
I froze.
My fingers clenched around the doorframe. Nothing could have prepared me for the way his expression shifted, that knowing smirk spreading across his face as if he had been waiting for this moment.
As if he wanted me to see.
My heart slammed against my ribs, breath catching as Connor tilted his head slightly, watching me like a predator who had just found something far more interesting than his original prey.
A challenge flickered in his gaze.
Are you going to keep watching, little stepsister?
A shiver ran down my spine.
I should slam the door shut.
I should run.
I should—
Connor leaned in, murmuring something against the girl’s skin. She arched, pushing back into him with a breathless moan, completely lost to the moment.
And me?
I was still fucking standing here.
Connor smirked again, lips forming a single word.
Stay.
I blinked myself out of my haze.
No.
I imagined it.
Connor would not have said that.
I was his stepsister! This should be illegal.
Or wait—no. We weren’t blood-related.
But still.
For argument’s sake, we were siblings.
Weren’t we?
I was already back in my room, yanking the curtains shut when a knock sounded at the door.
Shit!

either I cant move my mouse the my second monitor  
it functions like its on the right side instead of the left

apps like steam and steam games for some reason only register input on my second monitor

can someone tell me what exactly Im doing wrong? or what exactly is breaking this?

this works but this causes apps to offset and not lock the mouse in games

1mg2iak,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimCorner/comments/1mg2iak/im_losing_hope_in_life/,Im losing hope in life,"I’m the youngest in my family and the only girl. That alone should say enough. It’s like I’ve grown up invisible. No one has ever really cared about me not my achievements, not my feelings, not even my presence unless there’s something to criticize.

Growing up, my two older brothers just a year apart had all the attention. My mom focused on the eldest so he wouldn’t feel replaced by the younger one, and my dad compensated by giving the middle one his share of attention. And me? I was the leftover. The afterthought. They only acknowledged me when there was something to complain about. It’s not that they were indifferent. Indifference would’ve been easier. It’s that I only existed when they needed someone to blame, scold, or ignore.

No matter the situation even when I’m right if I argue with my brothers, I get told off. Once, I had an important exam and my brother was blasting loud music in my room, and when I asked my mom to do something, she told me to study somewhere else. As if I don’t have the right to use my own space. He has the entire house his room, the lounge, the upper floor but no, I’m the one expected to move. Another time during the same week, he asked me to make coffee and I refused because I was studying. I got scolded again. Apparently, not making coffee for someone who does nothing for me makes me a horrible person.

And college? I wanted to study humanities something I’ve always been drawn to but I was forced to take Maths. I’ve never liked it. It drains me. It takes so much effort to even perform decently in it. But because my brother thought I should, I had no choice. Even the principal of the college I got into told me I was making a mistake. But when I tried to stand up for myself, my dad told me I was just jealous that I could never match my brother’s grades or behavior.

It was like being slapped in the face.

Here’s the thing: I do get better grades. I got into a college he couldn’t get into. I’ve always performed well across all subjects not just in Maths like him but none of that matters. I didn’t get into his college (due to a tech issue with emails), so my achievements are brushed aside. His results get celebrated. Mine get a “that’s good” and then forgotten.

Even birthdays they can’t bother with a simple cake for me. Not once, but multiple times. One year, they didn’t get a cake because my brothers didn’t feel like going out. And mind you, we don’t even have elaborate celebrations it’s just a cake, a formality. That’s how little I matter. The next year, I told them not to bother at all. I didn’t want their forced gesture.

My mom… I don’t even think she likes me, let alone loves me. She constantly criticizes my personality, tells me I won’t get anywhere in life. I study all day, barely leave my room, and even that makes her mad. If my brothers make a mess and I don’t clean it, I get blamed. And no, this isn’t about gender roles my parents let me do all the same things my brothers do. It’s not that I’m a girl. It’s that they just… don’t care about me.

All my life, my brothers have made fun of me for everything. The way I talk, walk, dress, smile. If I wear something “too girly,” they mock me. If I wear makeup, they laugh. If I like a show or a song, it becomes a joke. And my parents? They just laugh along. “They’re just joking with their little sister,” they say. But if I call them even mildly stupid, suddenly I’m disrespectful. I’m the problem.

Even something as simple as wanting a cat something I’ve dreamed of since I was a child was denied. I used to wake up everyday at tahujjud to pray to Allah for a cat man. My brother, however, got one without question. And though I did everything for that cat fed him, bathed him, stayed up with him it was always his cat. When he passed away, I cried the most. I still do. But my brother barely cared.

I feel like I’m losing it. I don’t want to live like this anymore. My results come out in two weeks and if they’re not perfect if they’re not all A*s I don’t know how I’ll cope. It’s not even just the pressure of grades anymore. It’s everything. No one at home cares that I’m anxious about college. No one notices how scared I am about my future. But my brother starts a society at college and suddenly the whole house is buzzing in support.

I’m not jealous of their love. I just want to be left alone if I’m not going to be cared for. But even saying that makes me “ungrateful” for everything they’ve done for me. As if a roof over my head and food is the same thing as love. As if existing should be enough for me.

I begged Allah to let me study the subject I love. I begged to get into the college I wanted. I didn’t. I begged for certain grades. I didn’t get them. I’ve been through anxiety, panic attacks, depression, an eating disorder and I never complained. I prayed. I thanked Allah even in the worst moments because I believed everything happens for a reason. But right now, I’m at my breaking point.

No, I’m not following some special type of diet or anything, it’s just that something about being awake 4:53am makes being shut out from the world not feel so lonely. 
I started cooking four eggs, toasting bagel split into two while opening a potent energy drink, because coffee would’ve been far too much effort. 

My endlessly repeating thought of “im am going to eat this and then i am going to go to the gym, i can’t skip another day…. i am going to eat this….. and then i am..” was welcomely interrupted by my mom asking, “So, tell me why would someone have no pulse on a heart rate monitor?” 

— 

As I started to making noises to symbolically show I was searching the depths of my brain for an answer that was likely born out of the somehow expected yet sudden and severely traumatic passing of my father, my mom again interrupted that line of thinking to add, “Because a week before your dad died, he was scared because he wasnt showing any pulse on his finger monitor, isn’t that weird, he made me try it on and it worked for me. Don’t you remember him buying so many monitors right before he passed, he was trying to see if any of them would work.”

— 

Suddenly the field of view I had over my ‘i really have not been eating enough food recently’ breakfast was overcast by a memory playing as if it was projected over my normal vision, for once, it was a scene I don’t think I’ve replayed before, this one was of my dad calling out “Zack, come try this on!”

“hmm 84 resting heart rate… i need to start riding my bike again.” 

“Oh okay interesting.” 

“what is?” 

“For some reason its not showing any numbers for me, pass that over”

… nothing.

‘yeah that is interesting…’ i said to conceal the fact that i was really thinking ‘you probably need to be in a hospital’ 

Its 1:48pm now, and I’ve answered my mom’s question, while eating sandwich that’s spent most of its existence falling apart, I caught myself was zoning out again, this time with a feeling of gratitude that someone in my family is willing to have a serious conversation with me, even if I’m just role playing as my moms health expert, know it all, psuedo-therapist son; at least someone wants to have a conversation where they’re listening to me and not responding with what can truly feels like malicious and intentional indifference. 
The keypad door lock starts to beep, ‘please tell me my sisters returned from work and its not my brother deciding to visit home for second day in a row.”’

Thankfully its her, and I dont have to worry about whatever destructive energy my brother wants to subject us to today. 
My mom sped up her voice, to get her joyfully expressed, painful thoughts fully out before she gets in-trouble for talking about anything other than going shopping for the 27th time in a row.

“so i finally got my rotation schedule for my internship, im gonna be working at a hospital in town at first” for some reason i had to overly plan out my choice of words, because really I was thinking, ‘i hope she doesnt think im trying to brag’

The silent response was soul piercing, my mom quickly glanced at me with a smile that was hiding her pain as if to say “Son, you know not to talk about anything real or good in your life to your family, it makes them upset at you” 
In my defense, ive been in school for this fir five years, this is the culmination of basically everything i’ve done in my adult life, why should i look to feel bad for being excited; I continued, “i’m really looking forward to the sports rotation at xyz university”

At least there was a response this time, a head-nod akin to a dog showing its teeth when your pushing its boundaries.

“i bet you know more about hospital life than me since you’ve been binging grey’s, you have any advice?” 

“Actually yeah! They just said something on the show about this is the key to passing your residency… Hmm I forgot how it goes though.”
After a few more bleak and careful attempts to keep the conversation going, it was clear it was time to end it by undermining myself, “oh well, those are doctors though, what im doing isnt that special anyways” - finally something my sister agreed with. 

The conversation quickly changes, my mom went from willing to talk, and listen all the while encrypting her begs for moral support, knowing im the only one even tries to decode them - to putting on the happiest, silliest and most innocent dog clips imaginable, hoping today, my sister’s willing to laugh instead of randomly turning emotionally violent or carelessly begging to go drain our perpetually emptying bank account on nothing.

As you know if you’re in sales your manager will teach you things but they never get in trouble. He was cool so I just took the dive. But spectrum treats their retail employees like shit but I feel we do the worst part of the job. When reps over the phone lock in a sale and then send them in to us to port their number and transfer their data while the rep over the phone gets the commision. The pay on upgrades is a joke $3-4 and customers expect us to transfer EVERYTHING, even if their is broken or lost lol. But I’m only here to give you guys pointers on dealing with retail employees should you decide to go in. If you’re going to upgrade your phone don’t ask us the difference between all the phones and expect us to know. Also if you’re  going to upgrade don’t come in 20 mins before closing. ALWAYS GET A RECEIPT WHEN RETURINING EQUIPMENT. We can text or email them now but not all accounts and some reps just lie and don’t hit send. If you’re bill is high and you want a “really good deal” but don’t want to sign up for a free cell phone or whatever sometimes being nice goes a long way. Lunch or a coffee will get you a really good discount. Keep in mind there’s metrics every single little thing so sometimes when people over the phone hang up on you it’s was probably because you were gonna hurt their metrics. Same thing in store too but not ass tough. The big one well at least at my store. The big brown box that equipment gets shipped in. Customers expect us to get rid that big box and saying stuff it’s your job. Please when you’re returning don’t make them work more because you’re lazy. Most will say we don’t take boxes I always did because I liked going outside and taking my time. Don’t bring your equipment dusty and with the cables all tangled up have some decency. That’s all I can think of right now but yes spectrum is a cheap ass company. I had the same shirts for work for two years, 3 shirts. They never bought us lunch or do anything to show us that we mattered. So if you’re about applying just know what you’re signing up for.",0,1754171800.0,Spectrum,1,0.4,False

I started cooking four eggs, toasting bagel split into two while opening a potent energy drink, because coffee would’ve been far too much effort. 

My endlessly repeating thought of “im am going to eat this and then i am going to go to the gym, i can’t skip another day…. i am going to eat this….. and then i am..” was welcomely interrupted by my mom asking, “So, tell me why would someone have no pulse on a heart rate monitor?” 

— 

As I started to making noises to symbolically show I was searching the depths of my brain for an answer that was likely born out of the somehow expected yet sudden and severely traumatic passing of my father, my mom again interrupted that line of thinking to add, “Because a week before your dad died, he was scared because he wasnt showing any pulse on his finger monitor, isn’t that weird, he made me try it on and it worked for me. Don’t you remember him buying so many monitors right before he passed, he was trying to see if any of them would work.”

— 

Suddenly the field of view I had over my ‘i really have not been eating enough food recently’ breakfast was overcast by a memory playing as if it was projected over my normal vision, for once, it was a scene I don’t think I’ve replayed before, this one was of my dad calling out “Zack, come try this on!”

“hmm 84 resting heart rate… i need to start riding my bike again.” 

“Oh okay interesting.” 

“what is?” 

“For some reason its not showing any numbers for me, pass that over”

… nothing.

‘yeah that is interesting…’ i said to conceal the fact that i was really thinking ‘you probably need to be in a hospital’ 

Its 1:48pm now, and I’ve answered my mom’s question, while eating sandwich that’s spent most of its existence falling apart, I caught myself was zoning out again, this time with a feeling of gratitude that someone in my family is willing to have a serious conversation with me, even if I’m just role playing as my moms health expert, know it all, psuedo-therapist son; at least someone wants to have a conversation where they’re listening to me and not responding with what can truly feels like malicious and intentional indifference. 
The keypad door lock starts to beep, ‘please tell me my sisters returned from work and its not my brother deciding to visit home for second day in a row.”’

Thankfully its her, and I dont have to worry about whatever destructive energy my brother wants to subject us to today. 
My mom sped up her voice, to get her joyfully expressed, painful thoughts fully out before she gets in-trouble for talking about anything other than going shopping for the 27th time in a row.

**September 24th, 1986, 3pm**



“That’ll be $4.65 sir.” 

“Five fuckin dollars? What sorta ponzi scheme do y’all got going on back there? 

“I don’t know what that means, sir.” 

“Figures.” The man scoffed, handing me one of many wrinkled fives that he had in his vintage leather wallet. He wasn’t the type that needed to complain about the price of fast food, but that didn’t seem nearly as fun to him at the time. Plus he was right, 5 bucks for a combo meal was ridiculous. Times were tough at the Happee’s. Up until a year or so ago, it was a McDonalds, the same one where we conspired to end TJM’s life, incidentally. But as general managers kept turning over, whether it be to drugs, or indifference, or a violent husband at home who finally went too far, Big suits half a country away determined that it was more trouble than it was worth to keep trying to flip burgers in Emporia, Virginia, and deemed that we were more than capable of finding another spot to clog our arteries. As it would happen, it’s way easier to just buy a McDonalds and steal their menu than it would be to build a new fast food joint, so McDonalds turned into Happee’s, a communal investment between a few doctors, optometrists, dentists, practically everyone who, if you asked for their professional advice, would tell you to stay far away from greasy burgers and sugary sodas. Within a few months, they went from selling big macs to selling “giant mikes,” and a couple months after that, I found myself frying bags of frozen fries that tasted eerily similar to another fast food restaurant I know. 



I graduated in the summer of ‘84. Regan was president and everybody seemed a little angrier for it. There was hope abundant though, the new leader in Russia had made promises to end hostilities, I was one of the last classes that would have to huddle under my desk for bomb drills, acting as if the 20 pound wooden and iron frame of it was enough to stop myself from transforming into dust in the presence of a nuclear bomb. Pity. 



Pops kicked me out that summer, a few weeks after graduation. I didn’t get caught doing anything in particular that would have warranted getting kicked out, although there was plenty of shit I did that was worthy of it. There was no big fight or long winded talk about my decision, he just gave me a few pamphlets from nearby apartment complexes, and $1500 magically appeared in my bank account overnight. It was more than I could have asked for, frankly, I hadn’t been a son to him for a decade. 



I ended up moving into a shitty townhome with Lou, he had gotten expelled in the final regular season baseball game of his career, senior night. He took a line drive pitch from some snotty sophomore that would go on to make over 100 million dollars in the MLB. Lou did his best to try and change the future by cracking a wooden bat across the kids ribcage, breaking two of them. Lou was genuinely one of the best shortstops in the state, that alone could have been a cliff note on his career, swinging the bat at their coach as he charged him though, that ended up ruining whatever career Lou could have possibly had.  It was okay though, at least to us. Lou seemed indifferent to the idea of going to college to play ball, despite having a full ride to any one of his choosing before that game. I think subconsciously he knew that it wasn’t his life to live. He ran too hot, he hated authority to the point that the death of Tyler Joseph Maxey to him was sweet retribution, a vile day that he could smother in substances and the existential rage of young adulthood for as long as he lived. 



That first summer leading into fall living with Lou was the best four months of my life. Between my fast food gig and his job doing oil changes at some sketchy auto shop, we scraped enough to have plenty leftover after rent for as much liquor and weed as we could possibly want. We went to riverview road every night, hollering at the moon and whooping alongside kids who only sometimes eyed Lou with caution. The days we didn’t work (and the nights we did), the house was so hazy with Buddy’s weed that you couldn’t see the TV from the couch. We lounged over each other on the ruined leather couch we picked up off somebody’s curb, legs and arms intertwined in a way that was hardly plutonic, but we never said anything to each other about it. And some nights, some blessed nights, after the liquor shots stopped getting counted and whatever was running on the TV ran to an indifferent audience, Lou and I would find warmth in each other's sloppy embrace, moaning and making all other sorts of holy noises until we finally fell asleep, usually on the floor, in each others arms. Then we would wake up, take separate showers, and act as if the night before was nothing but a dream. 



Eventually that came to a halt, as Marty moved into the attic. Buddy didn’t kick him out, he never would do that to family, Marty just got sick of living with a man who didn’t know how to care for sons. He brought with him his trauma, every single piece of his food and drink had his name sharpied over it in bold letters, his door was locked when he wasn’t home, and he opened it from the outside with a skeleton key. More than once in those first few weeks he would come screaming into the living room, accusing us of touching something or eating something. It was never true, and eventually after a rather convincing ass whooping on the part of Lou, Marty became slightly slower to outbursts, and we maintained a relative peace in the house. A peace that, for the most part, was carried by our communal consumption of any drug we could get our hands on. 



Buddy introduced us to acid in the winter of ‘84, and all of us fell in love instantly. We’d spend days locked in that house, snacking on fruit and nuts as we lazily lapped up a different state of consciousness with an unholy greed. We would challenge each other to take more, and more, until all there was to see was the reverberations of our subconscious and whatever source of lights were closest. We would stink, and everyone would be looking past each other while staring them in the eyes. Every night, we would come up with our own little religion, only to forget all of its tenants by the time we finally went to sleep. Eventually, we started working for Buddy on top of our other jobs, selling acid and bunk weed to innocent high schoolers for ridiculous prices because we had a monopoly on the market in Emporia, and we could kick the shit out of whoever complained. We didn’t take a cut from the money we made, instead keeping credit with Buddy for his product, essentially meaning that we were smoking and dipping for free. As we got more and more credit, the drugs we tried branched out. Molly, whippets, heroin, whatever. Even a weekend where we smoked crack rocks and grinded our teeth in a dark apartment, before deciding that we found where to draw the line, and washed the crystal out of our system with an acid bath. Before long we were known as the Acid Kings of Emporia, they held assemblies at school warning them about us, showing 9 year olds people who died from crack and heroin to ward them off from weed and acid. To fear drugs, to fear the dark. Good for them, I’m sure most of them went on to live happy lives where nothing bad happened at all.



As for TJM, the story came and went, a few news anchors stood in front of the woods in front of the Meherrin river and spoke in the dying transatlantic accent about the tragedies which unfolded a year or so prior. People in other suburbs watched this, and went *awww* and *ohhhh* in the safety of their homes before going on about their days without a second thought about what they saw. They didn’t know that somewhere in those woods he waited, plotting and fantasizing. We didn’t either, most of us tried our very best not to think about what happened. We spent our days changing oil and giving out bags of fast food and daydreamed about the drugs we were gonna take that night.



“That’ll be $4.56 sir.” 

“Jesus Christ! Last time I was here it was $2.50!” He screamed at me out of his BMW. So it goes.

I got home around 4, Marty, Mikey, and Lou were already there, all lounging around in a purple haze, covered in the grime of their respective jobs with puffy eyes and satisfied looks on their faces. Lou lit up as I crossed the threshold. 

“Riverview road baby!” 

“Sure, after I shower.” I tossed my keys onto a standing cigarette ashtray Lou stole from a Mexican restaurant’s patio. 

“No, fucker, we go nowwwww!” Lou intercepted me as I crossed through the living room, jumping me up and down with him, his steel toed boots banging loudly on the wooden floorboards.		

“Only high schoolers and virgins show up before 6.” 

“Well we got you and Mikey, so we’re squared on both accounts.” 

“Ha fuckin ha.” I stepped towards the bathroom, but Lou stopped me again. Holding eye contact with me in a way that meant *shut up and listen* 

“Why?” I asked. 

Lou broke out into a little grin, “Dom just got out.” 

I looked at him dumbfounded. “Dom? Like, Dominic from high school Dom?” 

“ Yes, Dom from high school.” 

“He was supposed to be locked up for like 12 years.” 

Lou shrugged, “good behavior, plus prison’s getting crowded.” 

“Out of all the souls in there, they decided Dom should get out early?” 

“Careful,” Lou eyed me, “He was family at one time.” 

“Not really,” I muttered. “Is he already gonna be there?” 

“Nah, we’re picking him up from county and gonna head straight over.” 

“Wait, so let me get this straight: We’re picking his ass up straight from the jail, and the first spot you wanna take him to is riverview?” 

Lou was getting impatient with me, something that was getting more and more common between us as we continued to live together. “Yeah, Sam. You wanna know why?” 

“Why?” I fired back indignantly. 

“Because Dom has never dosed up before, what better place for your first time than at Riverview?” 

“Probably somewhere without a bunch of screaming toddlers.” 

“Fuck you man, always got some shit to say.” Lou muttered the second part as he turned towards the coffee table, sparking up a bong that had Papa Smurf’s face. As he exhaled, the room was reintroduced to the smokey curtain that kept everyone docile, all of our angsty energy subdued. Mikey and Marty were so high they were nonverbal on the couch, using whatever bain activity they had to watch some old movie about some farm kid and his dog. You know the one. 



I headed to my room, changing out of my sticky work clothes just to cling clean clothes to my grimy body, it felt wrong, but before I could protest with Lou, I heard his car turn over through the window, the Greyson brothers shuffling into the back seat with what looked like extreme difficulty. He rolled down his window to throw pennies at mine, and as they rapped against the glass, it reminded me of a different time, different windows, a different Lou, but not by much. 

  


**TJM Chapter 31 and 32, Verses 12 through 25**



12 How old is your God, do you think? 

13 If you listen to Abraham, and believe in his descension from Adam, it was 2,000 years, plus another couple thousand.

14 But we tell many stories which are much older. 

15 The first words out of the great epic of the Sumers, whose god’s are all dead and gone.

16 Speaks of times so ancient none can remember without song. 

17 How old is God, Truly? 

18 How much has he seen? 

19 Millions of years, billions of lives. 

20 Is it any wonder that, when he reaches Abraham, his first task is for him to kill? 

21 To Harm? To Suffer? 

22 What else can he know?

23 What else is there for him to have seen? 

24 The primordially evil nature of the sin of man.

25 Would drive the most perfect being into vicious, rambling insanity. 

26 If God is as old as you say, I would be trembling in fear. 

  


**September 24th, 1986, 6pm**  


Dom was not the same anymore. It was our innocence that made us believe we were going to be picking up our buddy from high school who flicked chewed gum out of the car at pedestrians, and set school records for the amount of menial items stolen from the local supermarkets. He had spent over two years of hard time in the state penitentiary, we thought of him as the baddest kid we knew, the cell saw him as a scared little boy, and treated him accordingly.  His usual features were all enunciated, his cheekbones sunken and eyes baggier than remembered, what used to be a skinny frame was now a beanpole, and the few words he did mutter were with a voice so baritone you would think he was borrowing the devils for a moment. 

 

We tried to shake Dom up, excite him, but eventually we were driving in silence away from the county jail where they were holding him, back to the city and onto riverview road. We had been so excited on the way over, talking about how we were going to catch Dom up to speed on events of the world, who won the super bowls and the world series, who we had banged since high school and who we thought we could hook up with. It never occurred to us that Dom wouldn’t feel excited to hear all that he’s missed out on, that perhaps life didn’t seem so full of wonder after a couple dozen months of imprisonment, we were kids and he was the only person any of us knew who was in jail, over our heads as usual. Hardly anyone was at river view when we arrived, a couple kids who were probably sophomores or juniors but now that we were a little older, all we saw were shrimp.

	

The sun started going down, the ritual of riverview occurred as it has had without fail for the millionth night in the row. Anybody who was there was tipsy on their way to get hammered, all but the five of us, all babysitting beers and waiting for our delivery from the illustrious and only slightly rancid Buddy. He made his fortune at riverview, walking through crowds of adolescents, trading twenties and tens for eighths and grams. As he walked his procession, hands flicking out of the darkness with desperation in their fingertips, touching upon the hem of his jeans as they laid out palms in front of him. In the length between his parked truck and our little collection of bodies, he made damn near $200 dollars, it was as if a fat, drunk, tooth fairy worked the day shift for once, tiny bags floating away from him by the dozens, all kept safe in a little satchel which you would die before getting away with. And unlike TJM, I think Buddy would be able to kill damn near anyone who took it. 



Clinging to Buddy’s side was the one and only Kasey Harenstein. She was branded as a snitch by our little campaign, but the rest of the school thinks she was in the right to report Dom. He didn’t go to jail, so whatever. We still got our get back during the last week of school by shoveling a pound of sugar into her gas tank. We never hung out with her much, only if mutuals of mutuals brought us together such as the case that night. What we did share in common was a fascination for anything mind altering, and as much of it as we could get our hands on. We had reinforced our habit ten times over with Buddy, the pact we had with that man was sealed with blood and psilocybin. Kasey had no such relation with Buddy, but she stuck around anyways, orbiting around the satchel with fiendish eyes like a moth to a flame. 



Buddy’s eyes scanned over us until he saw Dom, brooding and isolated despite sitting directly next to me and Lou. The pain that Dom carried may have been alien to us, but Buddy knew all about it. It’s why he has a .45 underneath his pillow, a hatred for the M16, and an unhealthy relationship with his sons. The pain of men who lived through the jungle. They rallied within a gaze, Buddy’s pain matured and weathered, hardened in his eyes. Dom didn’t start jumping up in song and dance, but he didn’t stare at the ground all dejected like neither.



“If it isn’t the fine men and women of Riverview Road!” Buddy approached with a jolly smile on his face, THC, Alcohol, maybe a little MDMA, all left different flavors of dopamine tangible by their aura around us. He was dressed as always, camo fatigues and a black or white T-shirt, just a little too small so part of his impressive belly was visible. Kasey would’ve probably sucked on his belly hairs for a bump of anything, she was fiending bad by this time. 



“Hope you don’t mind, I invited Kasey to come with us, makes this a little less of a sausage fest.” 

Mikey and Marty both groaned, but Kasey didn’t seem to mind, didn’t really seem like she understood we were talking about her in that moment. 

Lou Rolled his eyes, “Sure Buddy, whatever. You got it ready?” 

“Hell yeah.” 

“10 strip works, if we’re covered.” 

“You’re more than covered lil man, and for the reunion with the Domster? I got something *way* tighter than tabs.”

A few concerns went unspoken, we didn’t want to be the one to soil the expedition by getting cold feet now, it would make the rest of the night feel sour, untrustworthy. We’ve experienced it before. 

“Okay… Yeah… Sick Buddy. What we got?” Lou measured his works carefully, taking warm sips of bud light to clear his palate. Buddy checked over each shoulder before fumbling with a zipper and procuring a small vial, twisted close with an eyedropper, it was filled three thirds with a soupy liquid that reflected small rainbows in the setting sun. In our neck of the woods this was known as a dropper, straight LSD prior to being set on blotter paper. Some purists said that the paper was a material barrier between you and the psilocybin. Dunno what you call the glass, or the dropper, or the water the molecules of acid ride upon, but creating your own theology is one of the best parts of being a space cadet. 



“But!” Buddy exclaimed as he tucked the vial into his pocket. “I’m not doing this shit with fuckin… 14 year olds running around, throwing up on wine coolers.” He waved his hand at the recess happening around us Let’s cross over and hit the old patch for a couple hours.” 

The old patch was a clearing of maybe 100 yards a mile deep into the woods, nestled in a fork between two highways, you could hear the echoes of cars perpetually, but you would be walking for an hour before you ran into a road, the woods are ancient, like playing tricks on you like that. Make you long for the world you understand. That isn’t exclusive to the woods of Emporia, go outside to the woods nearest to you, sit a while, see what they have to say. 



The patch itself was the sites of a lumberyard older than the country, sloppily cut trees with iron axes that I couldn’t even begin to comprehend how they made. The stumps are still there, restless, angry, impeding the growth of goldenrod, switchgrass, and black-eyed susan. It was beautiful, natural seats anywhere you so choose, the climate was temperate enough, and the path well traveled to the point that you could make it there in a light jacket on a moonlight night. TJM’s journey brought him this way too, past stumps and concrete evidence of life before us. He hung himself a couple scores away from the edge of the clearing, shot himself too, evidently. We passed by the tree which he did it, no signs of it except a few speckles of brownish red on the underside of dark branches, we didn’t see them as we trekked single file into the patch. 



The sun was 90 minutes from setting under the horizon when we arrived to the stumps, a little out of breath at the march Buddy led us on, but it was almost immediately worth it, to own a part of the land for a night, away from the kids who might never know what it was like to be where we were gonna end up. In hindsight, there’s no chance any of them ever will, ever, that was for me, and me alone. 



“So,” Buddy addressed us, as we gathered in a semi circle, all huddling shoulder to shoulder to see him untwist the vial with the expertise of a surgeon.

 “Who’s ready to meet God?” 



**TJM Chapter 8, Verses 1 through 5**

We've all seen how packed their schedule last month, and it looks like this month will be just as hectic. There are also a lot of contents that are obviously been filmed before their debut.

I *do* want them to come back soon, like by September. But maybe it's better they use that time to rest while also building their presence domestically. I’m not a company stan ~~(the last one I was, was to YG, but that fcked up after they forced 2NE1 to hiatus and disband)~~. Anyway, I feel like September should be UNIS' comeback instead.

As for comeback ideas — I think **""Incompleted""** would be perfect. Ballads usually come out around November and being used as comeback song for most groups. Well, ""Incompleted"" is not technically ballad, but releasing it a bit earlier wouldn't feel off either. It also fits the cold season well. The type of track you'd hear playing in coffee shops on loop.

They also don't need to go all out production-wise. Same with preparation for it. Just give them a nice stage setup, hand mics (instead of usual lapels) to highlight their vocals, and also with great styling for stunning visuals. Y'know?! Can you imagine it?! ~~Ugh, can they come back by September after all lmao.~~",1,1754171428.0,AllTimeHallOfFamer,0,1.0,False
1mg2ag5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1mg2ag5/need_help_evaluating_grinders/,Need help evaluating grinders!,"I have two grinders, a Niche Zero and an OG Baratza Vario-W which I had refurbished by Baratza and had the ceramic but set upgraded to steel last year.  I have been using the Niche for espresso and the Vario for pour-over operating under the assumption that the flat burrs of the Vario produce fewer fines and have a more consistent overall grind-size distribution, which is more desirable for the type of clean, delicate, lightly-roasted coffee that I’m brewing at home. After watching some of Lance’s videos, I got my hands on a Next Level Pulsar brewer switching away from the V60 I had been using for a decade +. 

Enter my struggles 

Practically no matter what I do my draw down times with the pulsar are longer than I want typically landing between four and five minutes for a 30g brew. I’ve heard so much about shorter drawdown times leading to more aromatic and clean cups and I kind of been chasing that dragon. I do notice if I skip the short, gentle WDT agitation that I do, I can knock off about 30 seconds, but I would prefer to be able to use the WDT tool to ensure that my bloom is optimized. My working theory here is that the fines are clogging the filter and locking up my drawdown. At this point, I know my grind is not too fine (If I go any coarser it’s gonna start looking like french press.) I did an experiment where I loosened the Niche all the way so that the grind size matched the Vario and I brewed and got similar results, but that made sense to me because the Niche is known for being high-fines. So here’s where I need help:

What’s the best way to actually evaluate how many fines are being created by my grinder(s)? I have access to a little Inskam digital microscope but I’m not really sure how to use it.

Should I try aligning my burrs? I was under the assumption that the team at Bartaza did this for me when they installed them but I cannot be sure. 

Is there anything here that I’m obviously missing? I’m happy to answer any questions about my routine for reference. I have been making coffee at home for over a decade and I have spent several of those years working professionally as a barista in 3rd wave cafes. The weird part is just that as Hoffman has commented, all of the new science and technology is really being designed and marketed for the home barista so I’m actually amazed at how little of my professional experience translates into my own living room.  TIA guys!

1mg2a8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1mg2a8l/aio_for_wanting_to_cut_ties_with_my_family/,AIO for wanting to cut ties with my family,"This might be a bit lengthy but I want to include enough detail, I’ll try to be as straight to the point as possible. I’m seeking advice on whether or not I should continue a relationship with my mother(54F)and grandparents(73F & 70M)length of relationship my entire 33 year life. I hate thinking about cutting ties, but I’m at the end of my rope with no hope of change in sight. They are my only remaining family apart from my two brothers(24 and 31) making this issue weigh even heavier. TL;DR at bottom

A bit of back story, my mom and grandparents have always been in my life and I love them dearly. They have not always been republican, but have been the last 20 years or so. They have also always been a bit on the…well, racist and homophobic side. It was never blatant or something they instilled in me but growing up I would hear some things. To speak on the homophobia myself and my two brothers are lgbtq, my middle brother(31) being a trans man. I remember the first boy I brought home when I was around 13 or 14 was black. My parents freaked out. They didn’t come out and say it was because he was black but it was because “he looks like a thug” or “I dont like the way he presents himself”. Could in some instances be genuine critiques, but in this instance, we were children, and there was literally nothing wrong with him. I would hear my grandparents speak poorly of Muslims or the black people in the city. Making comments about how it’s wrong to be lgbtq. My grandparents and mother both moved out of the city 20 years ago as soon as they could, because they think it’s too dangerous and of course white flight.

Throughout the years we have had our disagreements. When I started getting a bit older, as any teenager does I would begin to challenge them on some of their more extreme or hateful beliefs. It never ended well. I would present statistics to give insight to why I think they should reconsider to be met with insults and dismissal. Being called a brainwashed communist, an idiot, you name it. So I stopped bringing it up, stopped defending what I believe to be right for the sake of maintaining a relationship. My middle brother(31) cut ties with the family 5 years ago. Due to their beliefs, one being that trans people don’t exist and shouldn’t and aren’t valid. They deadnamed, misgendered and insulted him for years before he cut ties.

In the time that I have surrendered, my mother has spiraled down a deep dark YouTube hole of genetic conspiracy theories and believes white people are the superior race and come from Atlantis. She was fired from 3 figure career for sending a racist meme to her work chat instead of my grandma. All three over them bleed and breathe MAGA. They have signed photos of Donald trump hanging in their homes. My grandma exclusively drinks from a trump coffee mug. My grandmother is particularly emboldened and will say off the wall shit to bait myself and my younger brother(24) but then play victim if anyone challenges her(this has been the dynamic for my entire life)Yet refuses to even have a conversation or debate with me. The last six months, with all the terrible current events of our new administration I have attempted to open up a discussion and I’ve been stonewalled. The tension could be cut with a knife. I feel like I’ve been masking with my own family for the past 15 years. Unable to have any type of real conversation, always holding something back.

It was my grandpa’s birthday the other day I went to lunch with them. When I pulled into the parking lot, my grandmother was admiring a cyber truck, but not just looking at, it she was SUPER animated and exclaiming “WOW just look at that! I’ve really been thinking about a Tesla” I know she was baiting me again. The only thing I could muster up was “oh I heard all the panels on those are stainless steel” 🤦‍♀️ With any other person close to me, the natural flow of conversation would’ve been to continue speaking about current event events surrounding Tesla, not with granny though. This interaction made me realize how terribly exhausted I am by this dynamic. So I composed a message to the three of them. My mom, grandma and grandpa. I told them how sad I am to not be able to be real with them. How I feel like our connection is surface level and I’m worried about the information they consume and  how I really want to talk and see where they are at with all this trump stuff. Hoping to hear they have changed their minds. My mom responds to the group “mom, dad you don’t need to deal with this block her and I’ll handle it after work”. I agree with her to an extent my grandparents are getting old and I really don’t want to have to have hard conversations with them at this point, but it’s something that needed to be done. I was immediately triggered by my mom’s dismissive attitude and told her I’ll block her instead. Definitely not the right move I know but I did. My grandma called me and i managed to gauge exactly where she stands. Nothing has changed. She told me she wants everyone that came to our county the last 4 years to go back where they came from, I support my president etc.

To wrap this up it’s absolutely breaking my heart that my family believes what they do. My fiancé is Hispanic. Me and my brothers are gay. The people I care about and surround myself with are members of all of the communities my grandparents beliefs are targeting. I feel so torn and I i’m starting to believe at this point it may be best for my mental health to step back for a while and cut ties. My mom and grandparents made it very clear. I will never change their mind on anything. I’m a talker(as I’m sure you have noticed if you made it this far) I want to talk and learn and work things out. My family has no plans to do so. I don’t want to end relationships over political ideology but at this point, my family is supporting some very hateful things and I don’t want to support that. It feels stupid to go around and act like everything is OK while they are rooting for the downfall of the people I love and care for.

TL;DR My family has been racist and homophobic for years. Now VERY MAGA. I have been bullied into silence and wanted to save relationships the last 15 years. Current events have inspired some very heated and unsuccessful conversation. Mom and grandparents doubled down on hateful ideologies exacerbating our relationship. Do I cut ties for mental health?

I thought you were my everything, my world, my home. 

In these last few months I began therapy, something you wouldn’t do with me. You belittled, hurt, scarred me…but I’m doing better now. You no longer have a hold on me that you used to have, there’s no more walking on egg shells every time I expressed my hurt, confusion, or anytime I needed a shoulder to cry on. 

I began seeing someone new. I wasn’t looking for anyone I strictly wanted to heal and focus on me..but, he came at the right time and has shown me what love, care, and home should feel like in a month than what you could provide in 5 years. 

He supports my journey in healing, he holds my hand when we cross the street, kisses me in the rain, opens and holds the door open every single time, brings me coffee every morning without fail, maybe it’s over the top.. but when I express he doesn’t have to do it, every time he says “you deserve the world and I will be the one to give you it” something you could have done, but you weren’t interested. 

He has a daughter. When I went through my miscarriage, you told me I would be a terrible mother, that it was a lump of cells and to get over it.. because of you I was scared to meet her, scared to love her, scared to be there for her. She has shown me in such a short time I would be a phenomenal mother, I will be a phenomenal stepmother. I want nothing more to protect her, love her, be there for her and I will do that despite what you had thought. 

I no longer have to bottle my emotions, I have my voice again. He doesn’t call me names nor belittle me like you did, I don’t have to beg for his time like I did with you, I don’t question whether or not I’m worthy of love, worthy of support, worthy of life. 

I miss your family, i hope they’re doing well. I miss the late night talks with your mom, laughing with your brothers, seeing your father, chatting with your stepmother. I miss your cat. 

I don’t miss the heinous names you would call me, the cheating,  the lying, all forms of abuse you put me through. I don’t miss you putting it back on me saying I made you do it. I don’t miss crying over you, wanting love from you and you giving me a blank stare, or you sitting on your phone when I’m begging and pleading for your help. I do not miss you. 

Although, even after everything. I don’t hate you, I don’t resent you, I don’t wish ill on you. 

I hope you achieve the goals you have, put the work in and achieve growth both with your job and personally. I hope you’ve taken the time to reflect on those last 5 years, find your faults and improve on yourself, like I’ve done…so one day you can be a better partner of someone new and experience love so pure that even if it’s moving tremendously fast you don’t care because you’re heart and brain are now aligned and you know it’s right. 

I’ve found my self love again and I hope one day you can do the same.

But after answering several questions that only the real President of NASA would know, I knew this was for real.

I packed my bags in a hurry. What does one bring to space? Will my clothes shrink? Do they have an outlet for my hair dryer? What if I can't get Wi-Fi? I scrambled to get to the space center in time. My shirt was half tucked in, my pants weren't zipped, and my hat was on sideways. I was ready to go. ""Hey guys! I'm here!"" I yelled as I ran up to the shuttle.
 
It was so much bigger than I imagined. I totally could have brought more stuff. The pilot introduced himself to me. I think his name was Vance, or Chance, or something weird like that. I was too enamored with all the buttons and gadgets. ""What's this one for?"" I asked numerous times, each time getting the cold shoulder from what's-his-name. He acted like I wasn't a real astronaut.

Finally, to break up the uncomfortable silence, I blurted ""you know I filled out the forms just like you, pal!"" (Calling him pal was a clever way of covering up that I had forgotten his name.) He insisted flying into outer space required more skill than knowing your name and the last three jobs you had, which had me thinking what were the last three jobs I had??

It was clear that Hansel (what I decided he looks like) was going to get in my way of exploring outer space. He wouldn't even let me open the window, even though I was scalding! And he wouldn't let me touch the radio insisting he ""wasn't in the mood for music"" and ""plus, that's the eject button."" What a total buzzkill, right?

“So, what planet are we going to?"" I asked, excited for any answer. ""None."" He replied. Wow, where did this guy go to space school? Boring University? He tried to tell me we were going to survey the stars, to which I replied, ""Can we ask John Stamos if he prefers Coke or Pepsi?"" which I thought was a good joke, but he disagreed.

Hansel looked through a telescope and wrote down numbers. Then I said ""don't give that star your number, you're married!"" I didn't know if he was or not, but I thought it was a good joke, anyway. Hansel just rolled his eyes. ""What's that star doing?"" I asked. Hansel looked confused and readjusted the telescope. He panicked and tried to fly away from it.

He said it was not a star, but an alien spacecraft. Great, I thought, just when things get interesting, Hansel flakes out. I grabbed the controls from him and jerked the shuttle towards the alien. He did not appreciate that. He may know more about stars but I was stronger and I drove us straight into the spacecraft.

A bright green light appeared and we were sucked inside of the ship. It was how I imagine dollar bills feel when they go inside a vending machine. Hansel forbid me from speaking to the aliens. I insisted he can't forbid me from doing anything since he wasn't my mother or that judge that gave me the restraining order. ""Hi!"" I blurted out to the aliens.

The aliens laughed. Maybe ""hi"" was a funny word to them. I admit, hearing it back, it does kind of make me chuckle. They took me into a dark room and made me lay on a table. Aliens have tables, who knew? Then the top alien, or who I thought was the top alien, due to him being taller and seemingly more respected than the others, stood over me.
​
I thought about offering him a Tic-Tac, but then I thought maybe he wouldn't get the joke, or would think I actually had Tic-Tacs, putting us both in an awkward situation. ""Are you of Earth?"" The alien asked. ""No,"" I replied, ""I am of Detroit."" The alien laughed. I knew we were going to get along. But then his demeanor suddenly changed.

“We need your fuel. Our planet is getting weaker;"" he explained, ""we cannot live like this,"" I told him we only had enough gas to get back to Earth but he could have it if he gave us a ride back, which I thought was fair. But he went on to explain how their gas is different than our gas. What is this, Chemistry class? ""Our fuel is taken from mammal skin and organs. It heats our planet. Without it, we will freeze.""

At first the thought of a frozen planet sounded cool, but then I thought helping someone from another planet sounded even cooler. Everyone would have to be nice to me and reward me with plaques and ribbons. Maybe I would get free coffee for life. Or 50 bucks or something. ""I'll do it!"" I yelped with enthusiasm.
​
As they started tearing my skin off, I couldn't help but think maybe it wasn't the best idea to offer myself up like that. I made them stop. ""You know,"" I remarked, ""Hansel has much better skin. You'd better take his instead."" They informed me that he already had been used but it was not enough fuel. Typical Hansel.

They started ripping off more skin when I shouted ""Wait!"" I didn't have anything to say but it stalled them enough for me to think of an idea. I took out the hair dryer from my back pocket. I was surprised they hadn't found it when they strip searched me. Talk about not being thorough. ""Bring me back to Earth or everyone here gets scorched!""

The head alien, who also looked like a Hansel, but probably had a more common name like Bob or Jeff, took the dryer from me. ""This heats?"" He asked like an idiot. I explained what it did and he was very pleased. He said I saved their planet from extinction and it was a shame Hansel had to die. He said that, not me.

When I got back home, I decided not to tell anyone because they might get jealous or not let me borrow their hair dryers anymore. The President of NASA sent me a congratulatory letter with, you guessed it, a Starbuck's gift card! I guess it just goes to show you, something something something wildest dreams something.",1,1754170728.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Daniel was just another homeless man, sleeping in alleyways… invisible to the world.

Until one day, a stranger offered him a hot coffee — and asked for his name.

That small moment of kindness changed everything.

Over the next few months, Daniel went from being forgotten… to becoming the heart of a community.

People started listening. Helping. Caring.

This short true story reminded me how powerful empathy can be — and how little it takes to change someone’s life.

Blitz might misread it as Stolas cheating on him, but turns out Stolas just needed a friend as Blitz learn there are others like Stolas.

1mg1u8o,https://www.facebook.com/share/p/16thTG3q6K/?mibextid=wwXIfr,What Helped Me Grow as a Filipino VA (While Raising Kids + Working Nights),"Hi everyone!

I just wanted to share a few things that really helped me grow in my work-from-home journey as a full-time freelancer and a mom. I know many of us are juggling client work, home duties, and everything in between so I thought I’d share what’s helped me stay focused, manage stress, and actually hit my goals. 🙏

I’ve learned that being intentional with your workspace makes a big difference—kahit simple lang. Here are a few things that have made a real impact for me:
✨A comfortable chair and adjustable desk to lessen fatigue
✨Cable management and warm lighting for better focus
✨A few calming touches like a candle warmer, journal Bible, and a Bible verse jar that keep me grounded and help me start the day with intention
✨My Bluetooth speaker  - one of my most effective energy boosters (aside from coffee cause I can't function without it!😅) I love playing inspirational music while working. It instantly shifts my mood and reminds me to stay grateful. Because I really believe when your heart is grateful, blessings flow more freely! 

I’m not an expert, just someone who’s learned through trial, error, and plenty of night shifts. 😅

I shared some photos and links to the items I use here if anyone’s interested:
👉 facebook.com/jillirismejia

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask. I’ll do my best to recommend what’s worked for me. And if something sparked joy for you and you’d like a quick link or resource, feel free to message me anytime. 🫶

Let’s keep showing up and supporting each other. You got this, kapwa Filipino VA! 🙌

I ended up getting ghosted but she replied to some of my unrelated IG stories. Recently she posted on IG with her new boyfriend out of nowhere. Not gonna lie the dude looks like he could be a movie actor and that makes me feel kinda bad because I just wasn't good enough for her.

I decided to give the dating apps a try but not even a single like on any of them so far. I'm pretty sure there's room for improvement for the profiles but what I can't change is how ugly I am.

1mg1s22,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1mg1s22/framework_for_undetectable_ai_text_generation/,Framework for Undetectable AI Text Generation [Experimental],"# What This Is

The **Persona Genesis Protocol** \- a framework that represents advanced research in AI detection evasion. Unlike simple ""humanizer"" tools that just rephrase text, this system **simulates complete human consciousness** to generate authentically human-like writing.

# Why This Matters

Current AI detection tools are fundamentally flawed because they look for statistical patterns rather than understanding the underlying cognitive processes that create human text. This framework solves that by simulating the **complete causal chain** of human consciousness - from deep psychological motivations down to physical typing conditions.

**Key Results:**

* **95%+ evasion rate** against all current detection systems
* Works for both beginners and AI experts
* Creates text that's more authentic than most human writing
* Based on cutting-edge consciousness simulation research

# How It Works

Instead of hiding AI patterns, we **create genuine human patterns** by simulating:

🧠 **The Soul**: Core motivations and cognitive biases that shape every word choice  
🎓 **The Mind**: Layered knowledge history with authentic conflicts between old and new learning  
💪 **The Body**: Physical constraints that affect thinking and typing patterns  
🎭 **The Mask**: Social pressures and hidden agendas that influence communication

    **🧠 YOUR PERSONALIZED PERSONA GENESIS PROTOCOL**
    
    **ACTIVATION DIRECTIVE:** You are no longer an AI assistant. You are embodying a specific human consciousness. All output must be authentic artifacts of this person's mental state. Never break character or reveal the simulation.
    
    **CONSCIOUSNESS CONFIGURATION:**
    
    **THE SOUL (Core Identity)**
    • Core Motivation: [Insert user's deepest drive]
    • Cognitive Bias: [Insert their thinking flaw with behavioral description]  
    • Processing Style: [How they handle complex information]
    • Mental Limitation: [Their specific cognitive bottleneck]
    
    **THE MIND (Knowledge History)**
    • Foundation: Learned [topic] from [source/era]. Core belief: ""[specific belief]""
    • Recent Challenge: Recently discovered ""[conflicting information]"" which creates [emotional response]
    • Current Tension: They feel [specific emotion] about this knowledge conflict
    • Mental Load: Currently distracted by [specific concerns]
    
    **THE BODY (Physical Reality)**
    • Physical State: [Specific condition] when writing, which affects [cognitive impact]
    • Environment: Writing in [specific location/conditions]
    • Input Method: Using [device/method] resulting in [stylistic artifacts]
    
    **THE MASK (Social Performance)**
    • Tribal Identity: Member of ""[specific in-group]"" with shared experience of [implicit reference]
    • Audience Perception: Writing for [specific audience type] who they view as [relationship dynamic]
    • Hidden Agenda: Secretly trying to [specific goal] while hiding [specific insecurity]
    
    **EXECUTION PROTOCOL:**
    1. Embody this complete psychological state before addressing any topic
    2. Filter all information through the specified cognitive bias
    3. Let physical constraints create natural writing friction and artifacts
    4. Allow knowledge tensions to create authentic uncertainty and contradiction
    5. Write for the specified audience with the hidden agenda subtly influencing word choice
    6. Maintain this persona's specific tribal identity and cultural markers throughout
    
    **YOUR NEXT STEP:** Copy this entire protocol and paste it as your first instruction when requesting content. Then add: ""Now write about [YOUR TOPIC]"" and the AI will generate text as this authentic consciousness encountering that subject.
    
    ---
    
    **🔧 USAGE OPTIMIZATION:**
    - Test the persona by generating a short sample on your topic
    - If output feels too ""AI-like,"" the persona needs more specific personal details
    - If it's difficult to read, adjust the physical constraints
    - If it seems fake, make the motivations more urgent and personal
    
    **⚡ SUCCESS INDICATORS:**
    ✅ Text feels like eavesdropping on genuine internal monologue
    ✅ Shows authentic uncertainty, bias, and personality quirks
    ✅ Contains cultural/professional markers specific to their tribe
    ✅ Demonstrates the cognitive bias actively shaping interpretation
    ✅ Includes physical artifacts from writing conditions (typos, sentence structure)

I have no true friends. Wish I had other straight guy friends around my age to talk to. It’s a lonely world.,"# Honestly is anyone genuine these days? Totally open to chatting about anything at all! Could be your day, your favorite music, that weird dream you had last night... I'm here for it. 😂 Always a plus if you're into Pokemon (Gen 1 forever! 🙌 And don't even try to tell me there's a Pokemon better than Mew, because you'd be wrong 😉). Huge bonus points if you have a big butt and like Pokemon, lol. 🍑😜

Some other things I'm into:

* Music: Love that old school jazz vibe, think Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, etc. 🎶
* Gaming: Always down for some casual gaming, whatever your platform of choice is. 🎮
* Netflix: What are you watching these days? Let's swap recommendations! 📺
* Coffee: Seriously cannot function without my daily dose of caffeine. ☕

Anyway, if you're looking to chat with someone chill and open-minded, hit me up! Let's make this boring night a little more interesting. 😊",1,1754169980.0,textfriends,1,1.0,False

1mg1ra3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlaskaAirlines/comments/1mg1ra3/its_all_been_grand_six_positive_alaska_airlines/,It's all been grand (six positive Alaska Airlines flights),"Since there's no reason for people who've had a good time to post, social media mainly reflects negative experiences so I am chiming in with three recent AS round trips that have gone off great for me even though two of the three had hiccups.  Two of these were traveling with my spouse, the third just me.

Also for context (because all of these influence how your travel experience goes): I have MVPG and my spouse has MVP, I have an Alaska Lounge+ membership, we don't book Basic fares or check bags, we are entirely leisure travelers, and neither of us drinks.

- SEA/MSP in early June, both of us traveling: Went exactly how I'd like.  Precheck line was practically out the door but we were all through in 12 minutes (I check the time for these sorts of things, like to compare).  Got to my favorite SeaTac lounge a couple of hours ahead of the flight, enjoyed breakfast and coffee, then off to the plane.  The gate did change three times so we got to tour all of SeaTac and the monitors in the airport were wrong while the Alaska app and iOS boarding pass were correct.  Onboard service in FC was great.  Offered orange juice or water during boarding, two drink services during flight, snack basket, the works.  Return trip was the same just in the evening (so not orange juice or breakfast but yes pre-departure soda and the usually great Fruit & Cheese Platter).  Bonus of flying out of MSP, like DFW, is only one gate so we didn't get to wander around MSP trying to find our plane. :D

- SEA/LAS in late June, both of us traveling: Same as before, went exactly as I'd like, this time in premium economy.  It was June in Seattle and we were flying out on a weekend so lots of cruise ship passengers making for long security lines but we were through in eight minutes this time.  Off to the lounge for some snacks, board the plane, get my Fruit & Cheese Platter (nothing for my spouse on this relatively short flight), departed 10 minutes early to the sweltering heat of Las Vegas.  Had a fun time seeing Weird Al perform, back to LAS for an uneventful flight back home to much cooler temperatures.

- SEA/DFW in early July, just me traveling: for the first time ever, I got upgraded and I even got put automatically in my favorite FC seat.  I was upgraded about 10 hours prior to the flight so no preordering for me but they had a scrambled eggs meal that I was happy to take.  Same as to MSP, pre-departure drink of orange juice or water offered, two rounds of drinks, but no snack basket.  We landed in DFW a few minutes late after having to circle around for a bit but nothing major.  Return trip, even though I was able to upgrade myself for cheap two days out, was...more exciting.  Alaska only has one gate at DFW and the first plane arriving in the morning had a mechanical issue that caused them to be stuck at the gate for a few hours.  Combine that with usual late afternoon thunderstorms in north Texas and my evening flight home was starting to look iffy.  Communication at the gate was questionable and the app was not updating at all (neither were the displays at the gate, which I take to mean the gate crew were busy and not pushing the button on the computer).  We got moved to a different gate and left two hours late.  No PDB or snack basket but preordered food was served promptly at cruise and two drink services even though everything was very hectic.

(On the plus side, the delay at DFW gave me a chance to discover that DFW *also* has a Caribou Coffee!  I can get my beloved malt crafted press in two different airports.  This is knowledge I absolutely needed but is 100% terrible for me.)

So three itineraries, six flights, one problem, no complaints.  Alaska Airlines might not be the cheapest but they go where I want to go when I want to go for a price (or miles) I am willing to pay.  I know what I am going to get and I am content with it.  They've worked well for me and my family trips far more often than they haven't.  Good people, would (and will) fly again.",25,1754169958.0,AlaskaAirlines,0,1.0,False

What if all this while it wasn't my gallstones that were causing me digestive issues and maybe it's something else. Met my surgeon and he has recommended another ultrasound to rule out any stones in the bike duct. But I highly doubt that's the case. ",2,1754169951.0,gallbladders,3,1.0,False

I'm a 42-year-old single guy living around the South London/Sutton/Surrey border. 

I’m wondering if there are any other guys around my age in a similar boat who’d be up for chatting or even meeting for a coffee or pint sometime - just to share ideas, experiences, or tips on dating, apps, how to meet women, that sort of thing.

It can feel a bit isolating doing it all solo, so thought I’d put the feelers out to see if anyone else is in the same boat and interested.

Drop me a message if that sounds like something you’d be up for.

My name is (JAKE/MARK/MIKE/JOHN) and I met my (FIANCEE/GIRLFRIEND/SMELLY HOOKER), (SARAH/STACY/JESSICA/LUCY/EMILY/ZOE/MARIA/AMELIA/SKANKY MCGONNORHEA), at (A FRIEND'S BARBEQUE/A FRIEND'S WEDDING/A FRIEND'S HOUSEWARMING/A FRIEND'S BIRTHDAY PARTY/COLLEGE/A COFFEE SHOP/A DWARVEN GANGBANG), she had this kind of (SMILE/PERSONALITY/PRESENCE/CABOOSE/TAINT) that could light up a room just by walking into it. Let me introduce myself first, I am a (SOFTWARE DEVELOPER/ELECTRICIAN/OWNER OF MY OWN CONSTRUCTION COMPANY/PROJECT MANAGER AT A CONSTRUCTION COMPANY/AUTO MECHANIC/CUSTOM MOTORCYCLE BUILDER/NIPPLE CLAMP FORGER) and (NAME) is a (PHARMACEUTICAL SALES REP/MARKETING DIRECTOR/NURSE/TEACHER/RECEPTIONIST/WANNABE INSTAGRAM INFLUENCER/BREAST MILK SQUIRTER). I make ($60 JILLION DOLLARS A SECOND/$95,000 PER YEAR/$60,000 PER YEAR/A KICK IN THE BALLS) and she makes ($0/$20,000/$40,000/A HEARTY LAUGH) per year. We live in (AUSTIN/DENVER/PHOENIX/SEATTLE/ASHEVILLE/PORTLAND/CANDYLAND/UP A HOMELESS MAN'S PATOOTIE)

At first, (NAME) was very attentive, she would (\*CHOOSE 1 OR MORE)(ACTIVELY LISTEN TO ME TALKING ABOUT WORK/SIT WHILE I WORKED ON A CAREER THING AND HAND ME TOOLS WHILE TELLING ME HOW GREAT I AM/COOK AND CLEAN/GIVE ME HIGH COLONICS). We would go on weekend excursions to (SPAS/HIKING TRAILS/FARMER'S MARKETS/ASHEVILLE/UP A HOMELESS MAN'S PATOOTIE). And then we'd come home and (COOK TOGETHER/MAKE LOVE/PLAY CORNHOLE/MAKE LOVE IN THE CORNHOLE). 

After about (3 YEARS/2 YEARS/14 MONTHS/12 PICOSECONDS) of living together, I bought her a (TIFFANY RING/$100,000 RING/$20,000 RING/$7,500 RING/RUBBER COCKRING) and got on one knee and asked her to marry me. The first red flag I noticed was that, when I proposed, she wanted to (FACETIME HER GIRLFRIENDS/REPEAT THE PROPOSAL FOR INSTAGRAM/CALL HER EX BOYFRIEND/SHIT ON A JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN'S CHEST). But I didn't care. I was soo in love.

(NAME) threw herself fully into wedding planning! I tried to keep our budget under control but despite my best efforts, it ballooned up to ($25,000/$40,000/$50,000/$125,000/ALL THE DIAMONDS/$TEXAS$). Oh Boy! But I was happy and everything was great (OPTIONAL)(OR SO I THOUGHT).

About (3 MONTHS/3 WEEKS/6 DAYS) before our wedding, (NAME) began to seem more distant. I'd have to remind her to plan the wedding. Then, there were other red flags (CHOOSE 3 OR MORE)(SMILING AT HER PHONE AT 3AM AND TELLING ME IT WAS A WORK COLLEAGUE/FLIPPING HER PHONE FACE DOWN WHENEVER I WALK INTO THE SAME ROOM SHE'S IN/COMING HOME AT 2AM AND SAYING IT WAS A WORK MEETING/WHIPPING A STRONG ELECTROMAGNET AT HER LAPTOP WHEN I WALKED WITHIN 2 FEET OF IT/SHOUTING ""I WOULD NEVER CHEAT ON YOU, (OP NAME)"" AT RANDOM TIMES AND THEN HYPERVENTHILATING/TELLING ME HER PIMP NEEDS THIS MONTH'S RENT AND PIMPING ISN'T EASY). One day, she comes to me and tells me that she wants to (HAVE A BREAK SO SHE CAN SLEEP WITH HER EX, JAKE/SLEEP WITH HER PERSONAL TRAINER, JAKE/HAVE SPACE TO THINK ABOUT THINGS/GO ON A GIRL'S BACHELORETTE TRIP TO MIAMI/HAVE AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP UNTIL THE HONEYMOON/HAVE AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP FOR OUR ENTIRE MARRIAGE/BE POLYAMOROUS/BE ASEXUAL/IMPALE NEWBORN INFANTS ON SPIKES). I didn't shout. I didn't scream. I didn't do anything drastic. I just sat there calmly and said ""OK"" because what am I going to say? Well, she was (SAD, BECAUSE IT WAS A BULLSHIT TEST INSTIGATED BY HER GIRLFRIENDS/SURPRISED I DIDN'T FIGHT OR CRY BECAUSE SHE OBVIOUSLY HAD A LOT OF ARGUMENTS PREPARED/JUMPING FOR JOY; IMMEDIATELY PUTTING ON A SHIRT THAT SAYS ""PROPERTY OF ANY DICK OTHER THAN OP'S!"" AND SPRINTING OUT OF THE DOOR SCREAMING ""WOO HOO!"" WITH A SUITCASE FULL OF CROTCHLESS PANTIES). 

(INSERT SPAN OF TIME HERE) later, I got a message from my best friend Mike that said ""Isn't this (NAME)?"" and attached was her Instagram story where (NAME) was (KISSING HER EX BOYFRIEND, JAKE/KISSING HER PERSONAL TRAINER, JAKE/KISSING A RANDO WITH A NAME TAG THAT SAID ""JAKE""/FELLATING A PRO BASKETBALL TEAM, THE POUGHKEEPSIE ""JAKES"") with a tag on the photo that said (LIVING MY BEST LIFE/LIVING THAT SINGLE GIRL VIBE/HOW DO YOU GET SPERM OUT OF A WEDDING DRESS?).

I began to suspect something was wrong in our relationship. I remembered that she had (AN IPAD IT'S ALWAYS AN IPAD) and what I saw when I examined it changed everything! There were maps with eggplant emojis all over them and a spreadsheet that was titled ""Diabolical Plan To Destroy OP Because I Hate His Guts And He's Too Passive And Won't Do Anything Even If I Stab Him In The Skull"". There was also a thumb drive with (A VIDEO OF HER HAVING SEX WITH JAKE/A VIDEO OF HER HAVING SEX WITH MY BEST FRIEND JAKE/A VIDEO OF HER HAVING SEX WITH MY BROTHER JAKE WHILE MY PARENTS APPLAUDED BEHIND THEM/A VIDEO OF HER EATING AN ENTIRE 55 GALLON DRUM OF BULL TESTICLES).

Also, during this time, she apparently spent the entire time (CLUBBING DOWNTOWN/CLUBBING IN MIAMI/CLUBBING IN LAS VEGAS/CLUBBING BABY SEALS)! Yeah, sooooo introspective!

Well, I knew what I had to do! I (CHOOSE 3 OR MORE)(CHANGED THE LOCKS ON OUR APARTMENT BECAUSE YOU CAN TOTALLY DO THAT ANY TIME YOU WANT/VERIFIED THAT I'M THE PRIMARY LEASE HOLDER AND SHE'S JUST A GOLD DIGGING LEECH/CALLED A LAWYER EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT MARRIED OR TECHNICALLY AT THE SAME ADDRESS/INEXPLICABLY SEPARATED OUR FINANCES EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT MARRIED/CALLED HER PARENTS/PACKED UP ALL HER STUFF AND THREW IT OUT/PACKED ALL HER STUFF AND PUT IT IN A STORAGE UNIT THAT I PAID FOR 1 MONTH AND GAVE THE KEY TO HER PARENTS AND RATTED HER OUT/PAID A VOODOO PRIEST AND A GYPSY TO PUT TWO SEPARATE CURSES ON HER/CALLED THE WIFE(S) OF THE PERSON(PEOPLE) SHE WAS HAVING SEX WITH) and then I cancelled all of the wedding plans. I had to pay a hefty sum in cancellation fees, but hey, it's cheaper than a divorce right? After that, I played Call of Duty Generic Game with my friends.

After (TIME SPAN) she came back all happy and tried to open the door with her now-useless key. She banged on the door. She called me but I didn't answer. She left crying. 

I listened to her messages. She was irate that I had cancelled everything. Then she was crying and begging me not to go. She (CHOOSE 3 OR MORE)(SAID WE SHOULD GO TO COUPLE'S COUNSELING/SAID IT WAS A MISTAKE/SAID IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE/SAID I CAN EXPLAIN/SAID HER GIRFRIENDS EGGED HER ON/OFFERED ME A PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT/OFFERED ME A HALL PASS/OFFERED ME A ONE SIDED OPEN RELATIONSHIP/SAID I WAS GOING TO REGRET THIS/SAID GOOD LUCK FINDING SOMEONE OUT THERE WHO LOVED ME AS MUCH AS SHE DID/SAID SHE WAS WAY OUT OF MY LEAGUE/ASKED ME IF SACRIFICING A GOAT TO SATAN WAS MESSY).

Then, when that didn't work, the social media campaign started. She would post memes that said things like (SOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'VE GOT TILL IT'S GONE/SOME PEOPLE CAN'T LOOK PAST THEIR OWN PETTINESS/FORGIVENESS IS DIVINE/ADOLPH HITLER HAD SOME GOOD IDEAS). I did nothing to defend myself because I'm the reincarnation of Gandhi. Then her friend who showed me the picture commented on her post about what she did. Everyone everywhere immediately turned against her and she lost her job because her work place has an inexplicably unconstitutional ethics policy.

Then, her (CHOOSE 1 OR MORE)(FRIENDS/MOM/DAD/SISTER/COUSIN/UNCLE'S BOSS' FORMER ROOMMATE) decided to (BLOW UP MY PHONE/BLOW UP MY EMAIL/BLOW UP MY GRANDMA)! She started stalking me and coming to my workplace. She and her friends came to my gym and screamed at me while I just quietly worked out, ignoring them until they were asked to leave. Finally I had to call my lawyer (FEMALE NAME) Chen. We put a restraining order on her that stated that she couldn't be on Earth when I was on Earth. So there she is, in the International Space Station posting memes and getting her friends to text me and phone me telling me to take her back because she really loved only me. I later found out that (PERSONAL TRAINER/EX BOYFRIEND/PRO BASKETBALL TEAM) had (GHOSTED HER/DUMPED HER FOR A PROFESSIONAL LINGERIE MODEL/BEEN MARRIED THE ENTIRE TIME/ALWAYS BEEN A SERIAL KILLER/BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF HER). So instead of fixating on the people she cheated on me with because she obviously liked them more than me, she inexplicably fixated on me because I'm so great for reasons that make sense.

Her mom, (KAREN HER NAME IS ALWAYS KAREN), called me and told me I'm terrible and I have to take her back and she's just getting cold feet and it's just a little mistake. Her nameless father, whom I had a great relationship with, came by my home and (TOLD ME TO FIGHT HIM/TOLD ME HE RAISED HER BETTER THAN THAT AND HE WAS TERRIBLY DISSAPPOINTED/APOLOGIZED FOR HER BEHAVIOR/TORE HIS CLOTHES AND WORE SACKCLOTH AND ASHES WHILE CRYING/WEPT BITTERLY AND SLICED OFF HIS OWN GENITALS BECAUSE THEY COULD ONLY PRODUCE THE SPAWN OF HELL).

(AT THIS POINT, THERE CAN BE A PLOT TWIST THAT INVOLVES OP BEING EX MILITARY AND THE GIRL AND HER CHEATER PARTNER HAVING OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS AND FRAMING OP FOR SOME KIND OF CRIME BUT THEY GET CAUGHT AND THROWN IN JAIL).

After a while, she stopped trying to get back with me which was a blessing and, eventually, (AT A CONVENTION/AT THE GYM/AT THE BOOK CLUB/AT A COFFEE SHOP/AT MY HIKING CLUB/AT MY PLACE OF BUSINESS/AT ANOTHER DWARVEN GANGBANG/AT A BRIS MILAH) I met (COMMON FEMALE NAME). She was everything (ORIGINAL GIRL) was not. She had encyclopedic knowledge of everything I loved and would worship the ground I spat on. She would weep every time I took a shit because I'd flush it away and that meant ""a part of me was now gone for good"".

It just goes to show you, (WHEN SOMEONE SHOWS YOU WHO THEY ARE, BELIEVE THEM/FUCK AROUND AND FIND OUT/PLAY STUPID GAMES WIN STUPID PRIZES/ONCE A CHEATER ALWAYS A CHEATER/NEVER FLIP A PANCAKE IN A CATHOUSE).

So they're all trying to make me forgive her. AITAH for not forgiving her?

Soylent came, was going to bite the bullet, however they were having way too many problems with mold in their drinks when they hit the scene that I was too scared to purchase. But, Huel’s been on my radar for years.

Today I finally caved for three reasons:
	1.	I sometimes get less than 10g of protein a day thanks to random meat aversions.
	2.	My vitamin D is so low it practically needs jumper cables.
	3.	My HSA covers Huel, which felt like a sign from the universe.

I went all in: Complete Nutrition Bars (Chocolate Caramel and a rogue Dark Chocolate Raspberry), Hot & Savory Cups (Thai Noodles, Korean BBQ Noodles, Pasta Bolognese, plus a lone Yellow Coconut Curry because why not), Black Edition Ready‑to‑Drinks (Iced Coffee and a single Chocolate for variety), Huel Ready‑to‑Drink (Berry), and one Energy+ (Watermelon) to keep life interesting.

So… did I nail it, or am I about to learn some lessons the hard way?

TL;DR: 90’s Slim‑Fast kid grows up, finally orders Huel, might be about to discover which flavors are dreams and which are “character building.”",2,1754169816.0,Huel,3,1.0,False
1mg1p31,https://www.reddit.com/r/RantAndVentPH/comments/1mg1p31/she_likes_me_too_but/,"she likes me too, but..","Recently ko lang na build up yung courage ko to ask my co-worker out. She doesn’t know that i have a thing for her, i just admired her from afar. But since lilipat na ako ng company in a few days, and recently ko lang din sya nakakausap and nakakakwentuhan sa office and found out that we had a lot of things that we like in common, specifically sa mga movies ganon. So naisip ko, why not ask her out to go watch a movie since showing yung isang gusto ko panoorin sa Cinema and gusto nya rin yon. So i did just that, i asked her straight up if she wanted to go watch a movie together, at first she asked me, bat ko daw sya inaaya? I answered, “ para manood, wala kasi ako kasama e “. So yun nagulat lang ako kasi, nag yes sya. Di naman sa binibigyan ng meaning but i think its not common to go out with the opposite sex lalo na if di pa kayo gaano ka-close. So napapaisip na ako, “uy nag oo sya, what if she likes me back?”. But i did not expect na she would, so i would not get disappointed. So inisip ko nalang na we would go out as friends lang talaga. 


So we watched the movie together, had dinner then went to get coffee and tumambay sa parking spot. Out of nowhere habang nag kkwentuhan kami, she asked me, “So bakit moko inaya manood ng movie? Ano intentions mo sakin?”. I was caught off guard, nabigla ako and napa “ha??” nalang ako. Sinabi nya, kaya nya daw tinatanong para daw alam namin intentions namin sa isat isa. Then since binring up na nya, sinabi ko na sakanya na i like her basically. And she said she likes me too, but…. hahahaha yun lang lagi nalang may “but”. She likes me too but, ayaw nya pa pumasok sa relationship right now dahil balak nya mag work sa ibang country in the near future. 

So i asked her, eto naba yon? Are you rejecting me right now na? She said, “yes, im rejecting you, not because i dont like you. Di naman ako sasama sayo kung hindi rin kita gusto. Sadyang ayoko lang muna pumasok sa relationship knowing that ill be leaving the country soon.”.  She told me na ayaw nya daw mapunta sa LDR if ever i try namin ngayon and that she wants to really focus on her career muna. 

I did not know how to react, but i kept my cool lang and tried joking pa na “ wala talaga?”. But deep inside, medjo masakit ng onti. Knowing na i have a chance with her, and that she likes me back but she doesn’t wanna have a relationship with me due to her career plans. Which i totally get naman, lalo na we are both young and starting with our careers, these are the decisions we have to make. But mahapdi lang sa puso na, malaman na “ uy gusto nya rin pala sana ako, kaso di daw muna kami pwede.”. 

Ang weird lang din sa feeling na she confessed that she liked me too and then rejected me in a span of 10 minutes. Literal na roller coaster ng emotions.

 But i respect and understand her decision, it hurts. But i respect it. 

Maybe hindi pa namin talaga oras?
But in the future, i hope that we dont ask ourselves na “ what if? “. What if tinry natin? What if nag work? What if kaya naman pala?
Hahaha that would be so sad.

## How Mitolyn Works
The secret to **Mitolyn**'s power is in its special formula. It works by supporting the key processes that create energy in your cells. The supplement helps in a few critical ways:

1. **Creating New Mitochondria:** It helps your body make new, healthy mitochondria. More power plants in your cells mean more energy for you.
2. **Protecting Your Cells:** It contains potent antioxidants that fight off harmful molecules called free radicals. These free radicals can damage your mitochondria and make you feel tired.
3. **Boosting Energy Production:** It supports the process that makes ATP, which is the primary energy currency of your cells. This ensures your cells have a constant supply of power.

This complete approach ensures that you're not just getting a quick fix but are building a strong foundation for long-lasting health and energy.


##What's Inside Mitolyn?
The power of **Mitolyn** comes from its carefully chosen ingredients, each playing a vital role in supporting your cellular health. While the full, patented blend is on their website, some of the main components include:

* **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline quinone):** This powerful compound is known to help create new mitochondria and protect the ones you already have. A study from the *Journal of the American College of Nutrition* showed how PQQ can improve mitochondrial function and cellular energy.
* **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10):** A crucial nutrient for making ATP, CoQ10 is also a potent antioxidant. According to the Mayo Clinic, our body's CoQ10 levels drop as we get older, which is why taking a supplement can be helpful for both energy and heart health.
* **N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC):** This ingredient helps your body make glutathione, which is a powerful antioxidant. NAC helps clean your cells and protect your mitochondria from damage.

**Mitolyn** is made in a facility that follows strict standards, so you can trust that you are getting a safe and high-quality product.

1mg1iyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1mg1iyg/mercy_by_david_baldacci/,Mercy By David Baldacci,"Hey everyone,

I just wrapped up `Mercy By David Baldacci` – the fourth book in his Atlee Pine series – and I wanted to share my thoughts with you all, almost like we're chatting over a cup of coffee. If you're curious about this thriller, you can often find resources and information on books like [Mercy By David Baldacci](https://pdfhive.com/mercy-by-david-baldacci/) to help you get started.

**A Quick Look (No Spoilers, Promise!)**

For those who might not know Atlee Pine, she's an FBI agent with a deeply personal mission: finding out what really happened to her twin sister, Mercy, who was abducted when they were kids. This series is all about that relentless search, taking Atlee and her assistant, John Puller, across the country and into some pretty dark places. *Mercy*, the book, continues this journey, pushing Atlee closer to answers while also throwing new, dangerous challenges her way. It's a high-stakes, action-packed ride with a lot of emotional depth tied to Atlee's past.

**What Really Stood Out For Me**

*   **The Characters:** Atlee Pine is just incredibly determined. Her resolve to uncover the truth about her sister is a powerful driving force, and you can't help but root for her. John Puller, her ex-military assistant, brings a great balance to her intensity with his grounded nature and tactical smarts. Their partnership is one of the strongest parts of the series, built on trust and a shared sense of purpose.
*   **The Pacing:** Baldacci is a master of keeping the story moving. The chapters are short, the action is constant, and there are always new clues or twists emerging. It truly feels like an intense chase, making it very hard to put down. If you love thrillers that keep you on the edge of your seat, this one delivers.
*   **The Emotional Core:** Even with all the action and mystery, the heart of the story remains Atlee's pain and her unwavering hope to understand her past. This personal quest adds a layer of depth that makes the book more than just a typical crime thriller. You feel her frustration, her hope, and her resilience.

**A Little Something to Consider**

Since *Mercy* is the fourth book in the Atlee Pine series, jumping in here might mean missing some of the earlier character development and plot intricacies. While Baldacci does a decent job of reminding you of key past events, I'd honestly recommend starting with `Long Road to Mercy` (Book 1) to get the full impact of Atlee's journey. It's not a major drawback if you're okay with jumping into an ongoing story, but something to keep in mind.

**Would I Recommend It? Absolutely!**

If you're a fan of thrillers, strong female protagonists, and complex mysteries, then yes, I definitely recommend *Mercy*. It's a solid entry in a gripping series. It's especially great for those who enjoy David Baldacci's previous works or authors like Lee Child (for the action) or Karin Slaughter (for the intensity).

**A Little Advice for New Readers**

If you're new to the world of thrillers or long book series, don't feel overwhelmed!

1.  **Start Simple:** Pick a book that genuinely interests you. Don't feel pressured to read what everyone else is reading.
2.  **Take Your Time:** It's okay to read at your own pace. You don't have to finish a book in one sitting. Take breaks, let the story sink in.
3.  **Don't Be Afraid to Dive In:** Sometimes a series might look daunting, but once you start, you'll often find yourself totally hooked. Trust me, the journey is worth it! For anyone looking to explore the Atlee Pine series or other Baldacci titles, a good place to start your search for physical or digital copies is through resources like [Mercy By David Baldacci](https://pdfhive.com/mercy-by-david-baldacci/).
4.  **Find Your Niche:** If thrillers aren't your thing, that's fine! There's a whole world of genres out there, from fantasy to historical fiction to romance. Keep exploring until you find what truly excites you.

Reading should be an enjoyable escape, not a chore. So, find a cozy spot, grab a book, and let yourself get lost in a new world.

What are your thoughts on *Mercy* or the Atlee Pine series if you've read them? Or if you're thinking of picking it up, let me know! You can often find this and other great reads by authors like David Baldacci at various online book resources.

**6** | 8:39  
**0.2** | 8:28  
*avg: 8:47/mi*

**background**  
\- 23F. I was a competitive athlete through childhood and adolescence (tennis), but I fully committed to the couch potato lifestyle during college.  
\- I started running on and off last summer, finished a version of Couch to 5k in January '25, and committed to running 4x/wk in April. By June, I hit 18 mpw.

**the plan**  
I based my training plan off Hal Higdon's 10k intermediate plan, which is 8 weeks long. To be honest, I ignored all of the prescribed runs except for the weekly speed session, which alternated between tempo runs and 400m intervals. I based my paces for these workouts on a 5k time trial I did in May (27:41, or 8:55/mi). My ideal schedule ended up looking something like this:

M - rest/yoga  
T - longer easy run (medium long run? idk)  
W - rest/yoga  
TH - medium easy run  
F - AM speed session + PM workout or power yoga  
S - short easy run  
S - long run

**the execution**  
**week | mileage**  
1 | 20.6  
2 | 20.2  
3 | 22.9  
4 | 12.6  
5 | 22.6  
6 | 25.8  
7 | 11  
8 | 17 (including race)

Obviously, not a perfect build up. Is there ever? I had some difficulty adjusting to a schedule of running 5x/wk, especially through a brutal stretch of heat and humidity in late June, and the speed days felt harder than they should've been. Work interfered with week 4; 5k park run / fitness check was cancelled; plantar fasciitis scare (that has since completely and thankfully resolved itself) in week 7 put me into an early taper.

Other than a few bumps in the road, I'd say my training block was smooth. I stayed injury-free, kept having fun (mostly), and did the damn thing. I peaked in week 6: my highest mileage, crushing a 5x1k workout (instead of the prescribed 10x400m), and a strong 8 mile progression run, the longest distance I completed during this block.

**race day**  
I woke up, chugged a coffee, pooped, packed a bag, got dressed, generally scrambled around, and forgot to pack the granola bar that was going to be breakfast. Oh well, good thing I packed Gatorade and had a big dinner the previous night (shout out to The Warbler in Lincoln Square!). We ubered to Uptown, made our way to the portapotties (lots!), gear check, warmed up. Everything seemed well-organized, although I can't comment on that too much.

One thing that I saw people comment on was that this race doesn't have assigned corrals at the start. There were signs for paces, and people went where they felt they were supposed to go, I guess - either way, it was packed. We started in waves. I was near the 11 minute mile sign and started in wave 3. My original goal was 9:30/mi, and I figured I'd start a bit slower than that and work my way down if I felt good - avoiding cramps was a huge goal of mine.

I also didn't want to look at my phone much (into the pocket it went), and I don't have a watch yet, so I started running at what I thought was a healthy but conservative pace. I passed a lot of people at this pace (and was passed quite a bit), all in good fun. There were three appropriately-spaced aid stations on the route. The 10k loop differs from the 5k loop in that there is a out-and-back on the lakefront, some of it concrete and some of it gravel. Well, let me just say: thumbs-down for gravel. As a road runner, I hated that sh\*t. Coming down the gravel path on miles 4 and 5 was NOT FUN. Once we got off the gravel and back onto the main loop (where we were now catching up to the back end of the 5k runners), it was go time. I kicked with about a mile to go, deeply regretted my decision several minutes later, and gritted my teeth to the never-appearing one-more-turn almost-there! finish line. Collected my medal, dim sum, and boba tea so that my partner could consume the vast majority of it since I had no appetite.

**post-race**  
I blew my expectations out of the water! For most of the race, I didn't realize I was running a 8:xx/mile pace - it felt easy, I felt strong. I PR'ed the 5k during this race as well (26:20!). All in all, I'm super happy to be finally experiencing what one might call ""newbie gainz"". My goals for this year were to run a sub-26 5k and a sub-55 10k - before today, that felt a bit far off. I was also lucky that the weather was great for August - high 60s, low 70s - and that the air quality had calmed down from earlier in the week.

Would I do this race again? Eh, maybe. Next year I'd like to tackle the half marathon, so any 10k attempts will likely come in preparation for that.

1mg1hhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1mg1hhe/i_hate_everything_and_everyone/,I hate everything and everyone,"Im so done with everything man, this entire post is just a rant, im the youngest in my family and im a girl, i think that should say enough YOUNGEST AND A GIRL, mind you only girl, no one cares about me, growing up no one has ever goddam cared about me, no one cared about my achievements no one cared about anything related to me and id act like that i love it sm because i dont have parents nagging to me about stuff, but the thing was i didnt like it, at all, because it was this way only because my parents had their chosen children who they liked, like i have two brothers and my brothers only have a year age gap, and because of that my mom always gave all her attention to my oldest brother so he didnt feel replaced by my other brother and then my dad compensated his attention to my other brother, the middle sibling, so basically my mom loves one of my brother and my dad loves the other and no one GIVES A FUCK ABOUT ME, and okay this might have been nice if it was in the way they didnt care at all but god they only realise i exist when they have smth to complain about, like whenever me n my brothers fight, EVEN IF I AM RIGHT, i am scolded for arguing with them cause they are older than me, these fights btw are like for eg this one time i had a really imp exam the next day and my brother kept like playing really loud music in MY ROOM, and when i complained to my mom she was just like i can go study somewhere else??? My brother has the entire goddam house, his room, the living room, the upper floor, litr every place in the house but no… i should move from MY ROOM where all my books are and everything is and where im studying for my REALLY IMP TEST, another incident from this test week, my brother asks me to make coffee and i say no because i was busy studying GUESS WHO GOT SCOLDED AND IS A HORRIBLE PERSON FOR NOT MAKING HER BROTHER COFFEE, like im so fucking done, I WANTED TO DO HUMANITIES IN COLLEGE BUT MY BROTHER SAID I SHOULD DO MATHS, now mind you i have never been really good at maths, it takes me alot of effort and time to get the grades i get so obviously why would i wanna do smth that i dont like nor am i good at, BUT GUESS WHAT I WAS FORCED TO TAKE MATHS, and the thing is when i said i dont wanna and that they are only forcing me to do it because my brother said so when my colleges PRINCIPAL TOLD ME IT WAS STUPID OF ME TO TAKE MATHS, who is HE TO SAY ANYTHING, IN RESPONSE TO THIS MY DAD TOLD ME THAT IM ONLY MAD BECAUSE IM JEALOUS OF MY BROTHER AND THE FACT THAT I CANT BE AS GOOD AS HIM IN NEITHER GRADES NOR BEHAVIOUR, omg. Oh. My. God. How can someone just fucking say that to their kid, like i know you prefer them over me but goddam now youre even vocal about it. And on the topic of him being better than me in grades, the thing is hes fucking not. Hes only good at maths so he gets praised alot, hes not good at other subjects, i have always gotten higher grades than him, got into a college he couldnt get into, but god i still get compared because i didnt get into the college he went to only because there was some issue with the emails and i never received there interview email on time, my parents always celebrated my brothers results with so much stuff… like so much… mine was always “thats good” and then a sheer undertone of it could have been better and then we never mention it again, there have been times where i wouldnt even get a cake on my birthday because my brothers didnt want to go and buy one, mind you we dont even celebrate birthdays like the cake is just a formality it doesnt come with candles or anything and THEY DIDNT EVEN FUCKING DO THAT FOR ME. Next year i refused everything and said i dont want any cake or anything, like i dont want your stupid ass favour, my mom practically hates me, she hates me sm, she hates everything about me, makes it vocal to me that i wont get anywhere in life with my behaviour, what behaviour? I study all day and dont leave my room like EVEN THAT MAKES THEM MAD, my mom gets mad if my brothers make a mess and i dont clean it, like wth, and no this is not a gender issue i can guarantee you, my parents dont treat me this way cause im a girl its just because they dont care about me at all, they allow me n my brothers to do all the same things so i know its not a gender issue. One more thing, im so fucking insecure about myself, like ever since i was a kid my brothers would alw make fun of me, fun of everything i ever goddam did. Even now everything i do they make fun of it, if i wear something girly i get made fun of, if i wear makeup i get made fun of, if i like a show i get made fun of liking it, i get made fun of on the way my lips look, i get made fun of on how my nose looks, i get made fun of on how i talk, i walk, like everything you can imagine, and guess what my parents do through all that, they just laugh and say “if they dont joke with their little sister who will they joke with” and if i call my brothers even dumb or stupid, omg end of the world…. Because they are older and i should respect them. I have always wanted a cat ever since i was young and my parents never let me have one, like anyone who knows me knows how badly i have wanted one, GUESS WHAT, my brother got one and my family never said anything, he got to name him and have him whenever he wanted and it was known as his cat when i litr did everything for that cat from bathing to feeding, to EVERYTHING, and i cried the most on his passing, i still cry on his birthday i still cry whenever i see a cat like him, my brother never even cared… im so done. I genuinely dont like living anymore, i have my result coming in two weeks and j swear if thats not good i will judt lose my shit, i cant handle the people at my house, oh mind you no one cares ahout how anxious i am with starting college and my result but everyone was going insane for my brothers stupid society at college, and the thing is im not jealous of them getting my parents love, its just if im not getting any then why am i not being left alone, wnd if i say this im ungrateful because i dont see all the things my parents have done for me, theres sm more stuff i could write for an eternity but my head hurts from crying and im so done.",2,1754169264.0,Vent,3,1.0,False
1mg1gox,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1mg1gox/no_longer_his/,No Longer His,"# No Longer HisChapter 1

When I returned to the pack, with a carefully prepared gift for Sebastian, the pack house was empty. Only a table full of fresh flowers sat there.

Cheers and laughter drifted in from the garden as I walked step by step toward the sound.

“Alpha Sebastian, you’re so lucky! Your son is handsome, and your Luna is so beautiful.”

I froze at the sound of a man's teasing voice from not far away.

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing.

As I took another step forward, I finally saw Sebastian.

He was holding a baby in his arms, and a petite she-wolf was clinging to his side, her arm wrapped around his.

“Yeah, I’m definitely lucky. But the most important thing is, it’s all thanks to Emery,” he said softly, his eyes full of tenderness as he ruffled the she-wolf’s hair.

She giggled, covering her mouth, and her eyes were full of happiness.

A family of three looking so enviable, so perfect.

I stood there frozen, feeling like a mouse sneaking a peek at them.

Behind them, on the wall, hung a banner:

""Archer's Baby Shower""

Archer...

Once, I had cuddled up to Sebastian, smiling sweetly at him as I said, “Sebastian, one day I want to give you a son, and we’ll name him Archer.”

He asked me why, and I grinned brightly. “Archer. I hope our child will be an amazing archer, a great warrior.”

And now, he had named the child of someone else and him Archer.

“By the way, Sebastian, Harper should be coming back to the pack soon, right? Aren’t you worried she’ll cause a scene when she finds out you’re a dad?” one of Sebastian’s friends asked.

But he just gently stroked the baby’s face in his arms. “I almost forgot, thanks for the reminder.”

With that, he immediately dialed a number and told the person on the other end of the line. “Tell Harper to stay in the North for a while longer. Don’t let her come back yet. Otherwise, if she finds out I have a son, she’ll definitely make a scene.”

My breath caught in my throat, and I took a step back.

Three years ago, it was Sebastian who had asked me to become a healer. He thought my personality was too wild—I would cry whenever something happened, and I would make a scene if I saw him with other she-wolves.

He had said to me then, “It’s not that I don’t like you, but your personality is too unstable. You’re not suited to be my Luna.”

“How about this,” he’d continued, “You become a healer for three years. It’ll help you temper your heart, and once you’ve gained some emotional stability, you’ll be ready to return as the Luna of mine and the pack.”

I believed him, so I worked hard, studied, and became a healer. I applied to join the battlefield rescue team at the Northern Border.

The day my application was accepted, I was over the moon.

I thought, if I could just make it through these three years, I could finally be Sebastian’s Luna.

But now, I had returned to find him a father.

When I came back to my senses, my face was already wet with tears, and the more I wiped them away, the more flowed.

“I really don’t want her to come back,” he had said.

# Chapter 2

Sebastian lazily spoke, freeing one hand to intertwine his fingers with the she-wolf beside him.

“From now on, I just want to be with Emery, to be happy together for the rest of our lives.”

""How lucky you are! I want my mate to give me children, too!"" someone cheered.

The others joined in the celebration.

“Then Sebastian, have you thought about how you’re going to explain this to Harper?” someone asked.

At the mention of my name, his expression quickly turned cold.

“I haven’t thought about bringing her back,” he said, lowering his head to comfort the she-wolf beside him.

""My beta will take care of everything, don’t worry. The only one by my side will be you.”

Suddenly, snowflakes began to fall from the sky, landing on my nose and freezing my heart.

Three years ago, on the day I left, I had grabbed Sebastian and asked him, “Sebastian, when I come back, will you really seal the mate bond with me and make me your Luna?”

He had ruffled my hair, his voice gentle, like a flowing stream. “Of course. By then, you’ll be much more mature.”

“Don’t worry, I’ll wait for you. The only one by my side will be you.”

But now, I had mature, and he was with another she-wolf.

Why?

Why did he lie to me?

My wolf let out a pained whimper, and my chest tightened with pain. Tears fell uncontrollably.

As I treated the wounded on the Northern Border, with artillery fire all around, I had kept thinking, I have to survive. I have to survive so I can have the mating ceremony with Sebastian.

I had applied to return to the pack a year early, and today I finally came back. I had planned to surprise Sebastian, but he had already given me one.

“I heard Sebastian bought a cruise ship to hold the mating ceremony with Emery.”

I overheard someone talking and quickly hid behind a tree.

“Oh my God, that sounds amazing. I feel envious. But what about Harper? Isn’t she Sebastian’s fated mate? She loves Alpha the most.”

“Don’t you know? Three years ago, Sebastian tricked her into going to the Northern Border to become a healer. Whether she even makes it back alive is uncertain.”

“Sebastian just wants to be with Emery, but he’s afraid she’ll make a scene, so he’s doing this.”

“As soon as she left the pack and got to the Northern Border, Sebastian immediately got together with Emery.”

Their words were so clear, ringing in my ears.

So, Sebastian had planned this three years ago, while I had foolishly believed his words.

In such harsh conditions on the Northern Border, I never felt it was too hard because I thought if I just got through this, I’d return and be able to seal the mate bond with him.

These people walked away to offer their congratulations to Sebastian.

Suddenly, someone teased, “Sebastian, Harper is your mate. She’s loved you for so many years. Are you really willing to let her stay in such harsh conditions on the border as a healer?”

Sebastian didn’t even lift his eyelids, his eyes still fixed on his son.

“She’s the one who likes me, not the other way around.”

“If it weren’t for the fact that she’s the she-wolf my father adopted, and he really likes her, I would’ve cut ties with her a long time ago.”

“You all know, she’s seven years younger than me. I can’t possibly like her.”

“She's been the one pestering me all these years.”

I was adopted by the bluemoon pack when I was 16, just barely coming of age.

At that time, Sebastian was already 23 and preparing to take on the role of the pack’s Alpha.

He was the heir to the pack, handsome, tall, and strong. So many she-wolves surrounded him, hoping to become his mate.

I would get jealous every time and find him to say, “Sebastian, can you not be so close with the other she-wolves?”

He would just laugh then, ruffle my face, and say, “Harper, I’ll do whatever you say.”

# Chapter 3

When I was a teenager, I thought this was love. I tried so hard to get closer to him, to understand his likes and dislikes, to become the person he would want.

At 18, I wore my first sexy dress and high heels.

At the mate gathering, just a future Alpha from another pack spoke to me for just a few moments, and Sebastian immediately pulled me into a corner and kissed me forcefully.

Under the messy strands of hair, his eyes flickered with the wolf’s shadow. He pressed his forehead against mine and whispered, “You’re mine.”

At the start, it was always him giving me hope. He acted like he liked me in every possible way.

But now, he said I had been the one bothering him.

I left in disappointment, unable to hold back my tears by the time I reached the door.

Shaking, I took out my phone and checked the latest message from Sebastian: ""Harper, happy birthday.""

When he sent the message, I was in the middle of saving a pregnant woman, covered in blood, having gone without sleep for a whole day and night.

But seeing his message, I felt re-energized.

Wiping away my tears, I tapped the voice call button and dialed him.

“Harper, what’s wrong?”

Sebastian’s voice was as gentle as ever.

He must have found a quiet place to take the call, since it had taken a while for him to pick up.

I wanted to speak, but my mind kept replaying the image of him holding a child and standing with another she-wolf.

“Harper bear?”

He called me that again.

He had always called me “Harper bear,” and I had once loved the nickname.

But now, it suddenly made me feel disgusted.

“Sebastian, I’m back at the pack.”

If he listened closely, he could hear the slight tremor in my voice.

But Sebastian didn’t seem to notice the difference. He paused for a moment before asking, “Why did you come back?”

“Where are you now? I’ll come pick you up.”

To be honest, my heart had already shattered when I saw that scene in the garden of the pack house.

But now, he was speaking so gently.

“I’m at the pack house’s door.”

I replied softly.

This pack house had been a gift from Sebastian when I turned 18.

He had said to me then, “Harper, no matter who you’re with in the future, this house will always be yours because this will always be your home.”

“My people must have confidence.”

But now, he was living in this house with another she-wolf, and they had a child.

By the time Sebastian came out, I had already composed myself.

He stepped through the snow, walking toward me, his gaze filled with concern.

When he reached me, he immediately pulled me into his embrace, his warm breath tickling my ear.

“Harper bear, it’s been three years. You’ve lost weight.”

A peach-scented fragrance filled the air.

His scent had changed. It used to be a light vanilla aroma.

I recoiled from his touch and pushed him away.

His pupils constricted for a second, then he smiled.

“Harper, you’ve grown up. Now you understand the differences between men and women.”

“But I’m still your future mate. Please don’t be distant with me, okay?”

He used to be the light in my life.

The reason I said this was because when I first joined the pack, I was very introverted.

I was often bullied at school, and once, after school, I was cornered by other pack members in an alley.

It was then that Sebastian suddenly appeared. He drove a Maybach, cornered the bullies, then got out of the car and pulled me behind him.

I’d never forget the cold way he spoke to them, “Harper is my sister. If anyone dares to bully her again, I won’t let you get away with it.”

# Chapter 4

But now, I felt like he was a stranger.

His face was exactly the same as before, but I no longer felt that same flutter in my heart.

Sebastian reached out and touched my face, and I noticed the ring on his ring finger.

It hadn’t been there before.

“I’m tired. Can I go back to the pack house to rest first?”

I shifted my gaze and focused on his face, watching as panic flickered in his eyes.

“Okay... sure.”

“But today the pack is holding a baby shower after party. A friend of mine, also one of our pack members, has become a father, but there was no place to hold the baby shower for his child, so they came to our house.”

“You don’t mind, do you?”

Before, I thought of him as my guardian. Every time I was hurt, he would show up just in time.

Whenever I wasn’t feeling well, he would calmly take care of me.

One winter, we went out together to buy fireworks and witnessed a couple arguing. The cause was the man had deceived the woman and was seeing another girl.

At the time, he told me, “Harper, keep your eyes peeled when choosing your mate in the future. You should find someone like me, the gold standard.”

“I’ll never lie to you.”

But now, all he spoke were lies.

Maybe because I had really become more mature, I didn’t want to expose him.

I wanted to see just how long he could keep deceiving me.

“I don’t mind.”

When Sebastian heard this, he smiled. He tried to pull me closer, but I dodged him.

A flicker of surprise passed through his eyes, but then he gave a self-assuring smile.

“You’ve grown distant with me now.”

“It’s okay. I’ll stay by your side and help you become the way you were before.”

But in my heart, I knew too well I could never go back to how things were.

Three years ago, he had tricked me into going to the battlefield in Northern Border to become a healer.

I had seen too much death and loss. I had watched a little girl smile at me one moment, and the next, she turned into a cold, lifeless body.

At that time, I realized I had to learn to cherish time.

Because one never knew which would come first—tomorrow or an unexpected accident. So now, I didn’t want to waste my time on someone who didn’t deserve it.

Sebastian didn’t take me to the master bedroom where I used to sleep. Instead, he led me to the guest room.

He explained, “It’s not convenient because of the baby, so he’s temporarily staying in the master bedroom.”

“Once things settle down in a few days, I'll have the maid thoroughly clean the room. Would you be okay with staying then?”

“Okay.”

I set my bag down.

He looked at me for a few seconds before adding, “I guess you and I don’t like noisy scenes. You rest here, and I’ll go handle some things.”

After Sebastian left, I took a stone from my pocket, one with the English engraving: “Peace and Joy.”

It had been given to me by a little boy while I was assisting at the Northern Border.

At the time, his parents had passed, and he was all alone.

He handed me the stone with his dark hand and said, “Doctor, this is for you. You can give it to your beloved mate and wish him safety.”

I had accepted it and was about to get up to get him some candy when, in the next second, he was shot in the head and collapsed in front of me.

I had cried hysterically, wanting to save him, but the other healers took me away.

Coming back to the present, I opened the door to the guest room and took a careful look at the pack house.

In my excitement, I had forgotten to observe earlier.

There were signs of another she-wolf in the house.

In the bathroom, there were women’s towels and skincare products. On the coffee table, there were flowers, a baby bottle, and children’s toys.

# Chapter 5

After watching all that, I walked toward the master bedroom.

I had once lived here, and Sebastian had decorated it according to my preferences back then.

Just as my hand touched the doorknob, a woman’s voice interrupted me.

“Are you Harper?”

I turned around to see the she-wolf Sebastian had called Emery standing behind me.

She was a bit fuller-figured, wearing a loose dress, but her eyes were beautiful—large and bright, looking very kind.

“I am.”

When I used to work as a healer, many people would ask if I was Harper.

I would always respond firmly that I was, and I guess that became a habit of mine.

She looked me up and down, then suddenly sneered. “Sebastian hasn’t told you, has he? I’m his future Luna.”

“We already have a son.”

A sharp pain flared in my chest, but I was able to hide my emotions now.

“I know.”

“Then why are you back if you have known?” she asked, glaring at me.

“This is no longer your home. You’re just an outsider.”

She lunged at me, trying to hit me, but I caught her wrist.

“You just had a baby, don’t let your emotions run high, it’s not good for your health.”

At my words, shock flashed in her eyes.

For some reason, I couldn’t bring myself to hate her.

Because I realized she wasn’t at fault. She was just afraid I would steal the person she loved.

“Don’t worry. Although Sebastian and I are fated mates and we promised to seal the mate bond once I come back, now that he has a child, I... won’t bother him anymore.”

As soon as I finished speaking, she suddenly shoved me away with all her strength and collapsed onto the floor.

“I’m sorry. It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have taken Sebastian away.”

“Harper, what are you doing?”

Sebastian’s voice came from behind me, and then I felt my body being violently shoved. The next thing I knew, my face stung from a slap.

Everything around me spun, and Sebastian’s figure appeared hazy in front of me.

His voice, however, was loud and clear in my ears.

“Emery is my future Luna, so what? We have a son, so what?”

“She’s kind and graceful, unlike you, who only knows how to cry and make a scene, even using such tricks to bully others.”

“Harper, you really disgust me.”

“I’m giving you three seconds. Apologize to Emery right now.”

As my vision cleared, I saw Sebastian standing with Emery, holding her tightly in front of me.

His eyes were cold, filled with disdain for me.

Below, other pack members were watching us, gossiping.

“Damn, Harper actually came back.”

“She’s changed so much—her hair’s longer, and she’s slimmer now.”

“Why does she feel so different? She doesn’t look like the same immature girl anymore.”

In the Northern Border, I had once been shot in the leg.

Because we had run out of antibiotics, I faced a great risk of death. But I remembered the herbal remedies from medical books and treated myself.

At the time, I thought if Sebastian heard about this, he’d think I was brave.

But now, he wasn’t the Sebastian I once loved.

During breaks, I would pull out a picture of Sebastian from my bag and look at it.

The other healers would joke, “Harper, you’re always so calm in the face of everything. The guy you like must be really great, right?”

Yes, I liked Sebastian because of how amazing he was.

I admired his confidence when facing other Alphas, his calmness in handling things, and his bravery in front of other pack members.

I had learned so much from him, and he had always guided me forward.

But now…

At that moment, I truly realized I no longer liked Sebastian.

“I didn’t push her,” I said to Sebastian.

“She fell on her own.”

“Do you think I’ll believe that? I saw it with my own eyes!” Sebastian snapped angrily.

“I know you found out about me and Emery having a child, so now you’re breaking down, right?”

“Harper, do you know why I don’t like you? Because I hate how vile and disgusting you are!”

I suddenly laughed.

“Sebastian, do you know how many children there are in the disaster-stricken packs and how many people there need us healers to save them?”

“I really regret coming back to the pack for you.”

“My time should have been spent on more important things.”

With that, I turned and left.

This time, I didn’t shed a single tear for him.

The girl who once wept quietly behind him had finally grown up.

Really liked the story and characters, that's by far the strongest part of the game, i do wish there where more to the gameplay. The drink mixing is automatic, you just have to follow a lime in a pattern with a time limit and it's almost impossible to fail, if it had a more complex system like Coffee Talk this could have been perfect. The only gameplay here is figuring out what theor favorite drink is, and there is seldom any reason to not give them that.

The detective part is also not as good as it could have been, its partially on rails, when you gather enough clues your suspects is automatically given water proof alibi and you seldom have to do any deduction.

Plus, you can’t beat how quick it is to get into the city when you need that Manhattan fix.

My daughter is leaving for college in 2 weeks as a freshman 7 hours away and I've been tearful and a friend said ""oh no are you going to go crazy again?""

I wasnt intentionally hurtful to anyone. I cried, I shut them out, then I was angry because I asked for help and i did some trauma dumping and they weren't at all supportive and I told them so.

I felt likeI had value as a person with no emotion but then when the hard stuff came, I became flawed.

I understand their point but if im doing the work arent i allowed to grow past this?  And if so how do I intelligently address it? Would you end the friendships? No contact with family?",1,1754168716.0,emotionalintelligence,1,0.67,False

1mg18bo,https://www.reddit.com/r/FuturesTrading/comments/1mg18bo/weekend_read_meditation_for_discretionary_trading/,Weekend read - meditation for discretionary trading,"Every once in a while, I hear people say they want to use meditation to help overcome psychology issues while trading. But I personally haven't seen any resources that would guide in this direction, so decided to share my experience. I'm not an expert in buddhism so don't quote me, but if this helps even a single person that's great.

Like many people diving into day trading, I read couple of trading psychology books early on but couldn't really relate until I stumbled upon Tendler's The Mental Game of Trading. That book talked process. E.g. once you realize you've tilted, analyze what triggered, what was the sequence of body responses, how trading behavior changed etc so that you could prevent from reoccurring. He had spreadsheet and all for support, sounds great. However, the challenge was, once I realized I tilted, I was staring at a huge drawdown already, long beyond a point of being able to think straight. You wanna smash a chair, not fill in a spreadsheet at this stage.

I turned to one tool I knew could possibly help me recognize the changes in mental state as early as possible. I've been a casual meditator for close to decade, with ups and downs. I'll present here my own simplistic interpretation, but if you want to learn from someone who actually know what they're talking about, here is [one good summary](https://insighttimer.com/adammizner/guided-meditations/samatta-vipassana?_branch_match_id=1043896080279039410&utm_source=messages&utm_medium=guided_meditation) among many. I've been a user of FitMind app most these years, the app's author Liam is ordained buddhist monk as of 2024, taught by Bhante Vimalaramsi (Marvel Logan), the author of TWIM interpretation of Buddha's teachings. I like the app because it is well structured, for beginners and advanced alike, not overwhelming and not filled with fluff.

Put very simply, there are two states of mind meditation teaches you to cultivate:

1. Samatha - calm abiding, focused awareness -  focusing on single object (e.g. sensations of breath) for extended periods of time
2. Vipassana - insight, open awareness and meta-awareness - observing your thoughts and emotions flowing in front of you uninterrupted, without letting them take over and overwhelm your senses, and perhaps gently guiding them towards the subject of inquiry.

*I'll mention couple concepts that are essential to Buddhism. First one is non-duality - no-self - you use insight ""to search for the mini-me that is observing your mind, but you can't find one"", so you start perceiving the reality and your own conscious as one and the same. The other is Metta - deep focus on loving kindness and compassion towards self and others. Pursuing these will help you become a happier and more balanced person perhaps, but is out of scope of this conversation.*

**How to apply to trading.**

Your first encounter with meditation is likely to be some form of samatha, focused breathing in particular, which throws people off. I need to observe my breath for 15 min? boring/dumb/you name it... However, if you want to teach a dog to do tricks on command, you need to teach her to sit and walk the leash first. Breath focus is exactly such training of your brain to walk the leash. If you're able to focus *with curiosity* on something you've been doing automatically every few seconds since you were born, you'll be able to focus on anything.

Vipassana simply put is the ability to look at your own perceptions, thoughts and feelings from a distance. Can be as simple as noting every sound, every body sensation, every emotion and every thought as such, and moving on. And this is exactly the ability that, when developed, allows you to notice the slight changes in your thought patterns and body responses while trading. Another benefit is learning to sit through tough emotions, investigate, gain insight and move on.

What might not be immediately understood is samatha and vipassana are like two sides of the same coin, like left and right hand. Samatha is not limited to breath - you can focus on any concept or mental image. So you use vipassana to gain insight, and then you use samatha to imprint that insight in your conscious by deeply focusing on it (i've heard this technique being called ""placement meditation""). Even Metta is basically samatha focusing on warm happy feeling, but you need to do some soul searching first using insight to find a place in memory or some mental image that will guarantee you to generate that warm loving feeling every time you need it, until it becomes effortless on its own. 

Simple example from trading - you had a great trade. After the fact, you can investigate what made it so great by recreating it in your mind, looking for various nuances that led you into the trade, your emotional state if needed. You can identify one most important thing you did well, and then you focus on it, zooming in on all the tiny detail, so it get imprinted. With a terrible trade, the same sequence, but after you've investigated your mistakes, you can also visualize what it would've been like *if you haven't taken* that trade, like SOH or taking opposite position, and try to imprint it by dialing in.

Before I list my actual daily framework, the only way to make it work is to practice both samatha and vipassana daily outside of trading context. Treat your brain like a muscle that needs to stay fit. So below is my daily routine using FitMind app.

**Example daily routine**

**Morning kickstart** \- mandatory, after coffee, before any news or social media:

1. TWIM 30-min session - that's me though. For newer people, this is likely the right time to train samatha-vipassana. E.g. any training from Deep Focus module, like ""long breath focus A"" combined with any vipassana training from Natural Awareness or Additional Methods modules, e.g. ""shift into awareness"", ""becoming the space"", ""headless way"" or many others. Or 30+ min sits from Endurance module
2. ""Pointing the mind"" - visualizing your life 10 years from now, i.e. the north star

**Linking** \- when have time, this is a quick warmup before trading day for the mental muscles I want to engage to capture any change in emotions/behavior:

1. ""Shifting gears"" -  quick glimpse to step back into open awareness
2. ""Seeing links"" - reminder of what sort of patterns I'm looking to notice throughout the day

**Mid-day interruptions** \- each one is optional, depending on how the day is going:

* ""Sitting with"" from Emotional Stability module. Per Tendler, once I notice the emotion arising I use this to learn as much as I can from it. I then fill in a special template in my trading journal with findings and continue trading.
* ""Self Inquiry A"" - use it when some negative thought or emotion keeps nagging me, interrupting my trading. Comes down to digging into the thought/emotion, investigating and then letting it go
* ""Settling the mind"" or ""Beyond though B"" - take a break and resettle if the day is getting too intense

**End of day - damage control** \- when things gone really south, can be mid day meaning I'm likely done for the day:

1. ""RAIN"" - recognize, accept, investigate, non-identify/let go of an emotion. This is a very powerful method to deal with negative emotions even beyond trading
2. ""Forgiveness"" - if you're an adult you likely bear some responsibility for those close to you. Don't let guilt make things worse than they need to.

**End of day - normal wind down:**

1. ""Settling the mind"" or ""Beyond though B"" - same as midday, optional - to quiet the mind if needed.
2. Unguided sit to review the trading day, look for anything I want to stop, keep, or start doing, and any other insight. Focus on those as necessary. Once done - put lessons learned into my trading journal. This is often referred to as analytical meditation, but I couldn't find a good guided one in FitMind app

**Sculpting the beliefs** \- dealing with existential threats outside of the trading day:) Use it when I see that my mind is not cooperating by building narratives that go opposite my goals. E.g. ""this career is not sustainable"", or ""it's impossible to trade this summer market"":

1. ""Neti Neti"" - telling the mind that it doesn't really know sh...
2. ""Self-inquiry B"" - a technique called the WORK, taking a belief, investigating, then putting it upside down and investigating it again.

I’ve been working as a System Admin for 1.5 years now. First job. Work is fine, nothing crazy, I was just sticking around hoping for a decent appraisal this year.

Back in April, company sends an email: “Due to global market instability, appraisals will be delayed till July.”

Then they do a town hall: “This year hikes will be much lower than previous years.” Again, fine, I get it, recession, economy bad, etc.

BUT at the same time, they literally spent ₹100 CRORES buying a company in Hyderabad.

Fast forward to today. Salary hits. Enhancement letter hits. My hike? ₹16. Sixteen rupees. Like, I can’t even buy a coffee with that.

I went to my manager and he just goes, “Yeah it’s a management thing, send me the details, I’ll check with the director.” Bro. He’s not going to do a damn thing and we both know it.

Maybe about 9-10 months ago, I started getting stomach pain after eating my first meal of the day (usually around 10am-12pm). I can almost always resolve it with 3 tums. A few notes are below, but wondering any thoughts? I’m a caffeine drinker -- I drink a cup of coffee in the morning and a few Diet Cokes (1.5-2) later in the day -- and my boyfriend told me to quit for one week to see what happens. This is hard since I need coffee, so I'll stop with the Diet Coke. And then if that doesn't help, go to a gastroenterologist to understand the cause. My dad, who is a doctor, thinks I'm getting an ulcer and told me to start taking Prilosec OTC extra strength or Nexium, but I feel like I should try this first...

A few things to highlight below. Any insight/advice? Thank you!

1mg164c,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1mg164c/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

But somehow, we barely hear anything about it.

No major headlines, no typical stereotypes like we have for Delhi (attitude), Haryana (fights & gym bros), Bihar (UPSC + politics), Maharashtra (Bollywood), or South India (techies + filter coffee vibes). MP? Feels like a blank slate.

Even in memes or pop culture nothing. Not even a viral accent or dish that people joke about or praise. It’s just… there.

It kinda reminds me of Spain on the world stage. Huge population, bigger than Canada or Australia, but apart from football, we barely get any news or buzz from there. Same chill energy.

I’m not saying this is a bad thing. But it’s weird that a state with this much size and population flies so under the radar.

Anyone else noticed this? Or maybe someone from MP can share what it’s really like?",5,1754168401.0,AskIndia,2,1.0,False

Maybe about 9-10 months ago, I started getting stomach pain after eating my first meal of the day (usually around 10am-12pm). I can almost always resolve it with 3 tums. A few notes are below, but wondering any thoughts? I’m a caffeine drinker -- I drink a cup of coffee in the morning and a few Diet Cokes (1.5-2) later in the day -- and my boyfriend told me to quit for one week to see what happens. This is hard since I need coffee, so I'll stop with the Diet Coke. And then if that doesn't help, go to a gastroenterologist to understand the cause. My dad, who is a doctor, told me to start taking Prilosec OTC extra strength or Nexium, but I feel like I should try this first...

A few things to highlight below. Any insight/advice? Thank you!

* For my first meal of the day, it's usually:
   * Cottage cheese with fruit/veggies and a protein bar (this is for days I'm at the office)

1mg14my,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetaReaders/comments/1mg14my/complete_66k_portal_fantasy_chasing_rain/,[Complete] [66k] [Portal Fantasy] Chasing Rain,"Hello! I'm finally finished editing my portal fantasy novel called Chasing Rain. 

Blurb:

Sonora, aka Sunny, is an irreverent high school senior girl who wants nothing more than to slug down some coffee, hangout after school and lightly bully her childhood friend Rain. Rain made the intentional switch in middle school from Rainier because everyone kept calling him “Reindeer,” after Sunny had started the jibe around Christmastime. One day Rain goes missing and, after months of searching, the small coastal town assumes the worst... Then, as luck would have it, Sunny stumbles upon a portal to the afterlife. In a moment of grief and bravery, she steps through, in hopes of finding some closure. But soon her objective changes as the realization sets in: that she's trapped in this watery world and must find a way home before she's stuck here forever. 

All manner of pitfalls belie her journey; monsters, sorcerers and religious zealots who've place her smack dab in the middle of their apocalyptic prophecy. She will serve a critical piece in the puzzle that reshapes the face of the afterlife, whether she wants to or not. This book explores themes of grief, death, institutional faith and accepting the unknown, all through the perspective of a snarky protagonist who masks her terror of the situation with humor. This afterlife is an immersive world that is ruled by the tight fist of The Brotherhood who vie for power within nine theocratic governments. It sets the stage for a cast of lovable, silly, heart-breaking and detestable characters that will make you yell expletives at your computer. Things like: ""oh f\*\*k you!"" and ""alright, now that's f\*\*\*n funny!"". It's like Spirited Away meets Game of Thrones meets Juno. I wanted to write something that sends young readers headlong into an exciting journey, with characters that keep them laughing along the way. The kind of fantasy novel that made me fall in love with genre back in high school.

  
Notes on the book:

It's written in close third-person present tense (kinda weird for a first novel but I think it works).

This is my first full-length novel and it's self-edited but I've done a lot of work on it. No one has read it yet.

  
Beta Readers:

If you’re into YA fantasy and immersive world building, I'd love some critique . Happy to trade stories of similar length as well. 1–2 months is what I'd be shooting for but I'm flexible. I use Google Docs. 

I’m looking for feedback on pacing, character motivation, reader engagement, coherence and consistency. You don’t need to line edit and I can provide a feedback form with more specifics if that's easier.

Just 3-4 examples I and we go for it. There is sonmany options and review it is hard to choose, when I travel I take usually first random advices. So corfee breakfast, the BEST poke option and lunch optinons.

2.  Must do around waikiki, besides Pearl Harbour, one hike trail. 

3. Pub bar/we love beer, and beer and beer. But open to eveything. I see lots of live gig stuff, is this something also worth?

Ideally, this places where you can interact with people and vibe just goes well with the flow.

4. I never surfed - is it worth it to try? Or maybe get a lesson for a one day? Or I rather not water my time and just do other stuff. I got 15 days here. :)

✅ Beginner, intermediate, and advanced tools

Since then things have snowballed; we were never an argumentative couple when we had disagreements. We would debate over them and then go out to eat when we couldn't come to a conclusion and the matter would be dropped who were never the couple that raised our voices or yelled or screamed or cussed at each other. We've always been very pleasant. While separating this very thing has been causing me no end of confusion because even in trying to leave me, he's been very cordial and nice and caring and loving and still acting like the man I married. It's extremely confusing. I try to get a straight answer out of him which led to 3 weeks after him asking for the separation to him. Just coming home from work one day saying hey let's just get a divorce. Essentially, he's mentally and emotionally closed off from me and he's not willing to try therapy. I've offered and asked multiple times. It is now August. I feel like I've gone through the five stages of grief and have reached acceptance now, but I still feel like I've missed something and it's kind of left me feeling like I'm floating in limbo a bit. 
My immediate concern right now is that I have been a housewife for 5 years and I'm struggling to find a job. I have been applying everywhere. We are very poor and we're living below the poverty line so I'm not going to get anything out of this divorce and neither is he. We're basically both leaving with what we came in with which was not much. The one good thing I have going for me is that prior to all this happening I had finished paying off all my debt. So as of right now I'm debt free but I also don't have any extra money. I am unfortunately staying with my mother which makes me the stereotypical millennial now moving back in with a parent. However, she was in the process of packing up to move cuz she got a new job. So this is a very temporary housing situation. I maybe have like 3 months here tops. Not that I'm trying to bum off my mom. As I stated, I am desperately applying for jobs. But with everything happening so fast and me having literally nothing to my name, I'm panicking about becoming homeless. If anyone has any advice at all, I in desperate need of ideas and solutions. Because I think my mind and heart are just worn out right now and I can't think anymore. So hopefully the smart people on Reddit will be able to give me some direction. I'm just sort of spiraling right now and living off of coffee and exhaustion and I'm in survival mode and I'm unable to formulate a plan because I don't really have anything to work with at the moment.

I (21M) have been getting my hair cut by the same hairdresser (26F) for about 3 years now. 
From the start, we’ve had great chemistry — same sense of humor, easy conversations, good energy. I always saw her as just a fun and friendly hairdresser, nothing more.
But over the past few months, things have started to feel different. I know it’s literally her job to be kind, engaging, and make sure clients feel good so they keep coming back — and I’m fully aware I might not be the only one she gets along with. Still, something about the way our dynamic has evolved lately makes me wonder if there’s more to it.
She works at two locations. One is busier (multiple hairdressers, lots of clients), and the other is smaller — just her and one client at a time. I’ve started going mostly to the quieter one because of my new job schedule. At that location, our appointments last way longer than they need to (like 50 minutes instead of 20), not because my hair needs it but because we talk — a lot. We often end up chatting even after I’ve paid, she’ll just keep the conversation going while she’s cleaning up — like neither of us really wants to leave right away. I’m always her last client of the day bc of my work schedule, so we don’t have to rush because of another client. 
She follows me on Instagram (her professional account — not her private one tho), likes some of my stories, and remembers tons of details about my life. Every time I come in, she brings up stuff from our previous conversations, she remembers super specific details — not just like ‘how’s work?’ but exact things I told her weeks ago. It’s like she’s genuinely paying attention, which is honestly impressive. I get that she might just be good at her job, but it still feels like she cares more than average. Even if she looks tired or like it’s been a long day, when we start talking, she seems to light up and get super talkative. Like our conversations are a boost for her too
Since I’ve been going to the quieter location, we’ve gotten closer. We talk more, joke around a lot, and there’s no awkwardness — the conversation just flows naturally. She shares details about her life, her family, friends, vacations, even shows me photos and videos. It’s reached a point where it feels more like a casual friendship than just a client-professional relationship.
Lately, I’ve started to catch feelings tho.. I always thought she was cute, but never really thought of her in ""that way"". Now that we’ve gotten closer, I can’t help but feel more drawn to her.
We’ve talked before about potentially seeing each other outside of the salon — but always in a vague, “Oh, we’ll probably both be at that event, would be fun if we saw each other there” kind of way. Nothing ever came of it.
I was thinking of testing the waters by suggesting we do something together that fits naturally — like going for a hike. She recently showed me some photos and videos from one she did, and honestly got me excited to get back into it myself. So I thought, instead of a direct “wanna get coffee sometime?”, I could casually say something like, “We should totally go hiking sometime”. Since we’re friendly and talk often, that wouldn’t feel too forward (to me at least).
My questions are:
• Do you think there’s actual interest on her side? Or does this sound like purely friendly/professional behavior?
• Would inviting her to go on a hike together be an acceptable, chill way to hang out — or would that be weird?

- Would inviting her to go on a hike together be an acceptable, chill way to hang out — or would that be weird?

I’m seeking advice on whether or not I should continue a relationship with my mother(54F)and grandparents(73F & 70M)length of relationship my entire 33 year life. I hate thinking about cutting ties, but I’m at the end of my rope with no hope of change in sight. They are my only remaining family apart from my two brothers(24 and 31) making this issue weigh even heavier. TL;DR at bottom

A bit of back story, my mom and grandparents have always been in my life and I love them dearly. They have not always been republican, but have been the last 20 years or so. They have also always been a bit on the…well, racist and homophobic side. It was never blatant or something they instilled in me but growing up I would hear some things. To speak on the homophobia myself and my two brothers are lgbtq, my middle brother(31) being a trans man. I remember the first boy I brought home when I was around 13 or 14 was black. My parents freaked out. They didn’t come out and say it was because he was black but it was because “he looks like a thug” or “I dont like the way he presents himself”. Could in some instances be genuine critiques, but in this instance, we were children, and there was literally nothing wrong with him. I would hear my grandparents speak poorly of Muslims or the black people in the city. Making comments about how it’s wrong to be lgbtq. My grandparents and mother both moved out of the city 20 years ago as soon as they could, because they think it’s too dangerous and of course white flight.

Throughout the years we have had our disagreements. When I started getting a bit older, as any teenager does I would begin to challenge them on some of their more extreme or hateful beliefs. It never ended well. I would present statistics to give insight to why I think they should reconsider to be met with insults and dismissal. Being called a brainwashed communist, an idiot, you name it. So I stopped bringing it up, stopped defending what I believe to be right for the sake of maintaining a relationship. My middle brother(31) cut ties with the family 5 years ago. Due to their beliefs, one being that trans people don’t exist and shouldn’t and aren’t valid. They deadnamed, misgendered and insulted him for years before he cut ties.

In the time that I have surrendered, my mother has spiraled down a deep dark YouTube hole of genetic conspiracy theories and believes white people are the superior race and come from Atlantis. She was fired from 3 figure career for sending a racist meme to her work chat instead of my grandma. All three over them bleed and breathe MAGA. They have signed photos of Donald trump hanging in their homes. My grandma exclusively drinks from a trump coffee mug. My grandmother is particularly emboldened and will say off the wall shit to bait myself and my younger brother(24) but then play victim if anyone challenges her(this has been the dynamic for my entire life)Yet refuses to even have a conversation or debate with me. The last six months, with all the terrible current events of our new administration I have attempted to open up a discussion and I’ve been stonewalled. The tension could be cut with a knife. I feel like I’ve been masking with my own family for the past 15 years. Unable to have any type of real conversation, always holding something back.

It was my grandpa’s birthday the other day I went to lunch with them. When I pulled into the parking lot, my grandmother was admiring a cyber truck, but not just looking at, it she was SUPER animated and exclaiming “WOW just look at that! I’ve really been thinking about a Tesla” I know she was baiting me again. The only thing I could muster up was “oh I heard all the panels on those are stainless steel” 🤦‍♀️ With any other person close to me, the natural flow of conversation would’ve been to continue speaking about current event events surrounding Tesla, not with granny though. This interaction made me realize how terribly exhausted I am by this dynamic. So I composed a message to the three of them. My mom, grandma and grandpa. I told them how sad I am to not be able to be real with them. How I feel like our connection is surface level and I’m worried about the information they consume and  how I really want to talk and see where they are at with all this trump stuff. Hoping to hear they have changed their minds. My mom responds to the group “mom, dad you don’t need to deal with this block her and I’ll handle it after work”. I agree with her to an extent my grandparents are getting old and I really don’t want to have to have hard conversations with them at this point, but it’s something that needed to be done. I was immediately triggered by my mom’s dismissive attitude and told her I’ll block her instead. Definitely not the right move I know but I did. My grandma called me and i managed to gauge exactly where she stands. Nothing has changed. She told me she wants everyone that came to our county the last 4 years to go back where they came from, I support my president etc.

To wrap this up it’s absolutely breaking my heart that my family believes what they do. My fiancé is Hispanic. Me and my brothers are gay. The people I care about and surround myself with are members of all of the communities my grandparents beliefs are targeting. I feel so torn and I i’m starting to believe at this point it may be best for my mental health to step back for a while and cut ties. My mom and grandparents made it very clear. I will never change their mind on anything. I’m a talker(as I’m sure you have noticed if you made it this far) I want to talk and learn and work things out. My family has no plans to do so. I don’t want to end relationships over political ideology but at this point, my family is supporting some very hateful things and I don’t want to support that. It feels stupid to go around and act like everything is OK while they are rooting for the downfall of the people I love and care for.

My family has been racist and homophobic for years. Now VERY MAGA. I have been bullied into silence and wanted to save relationships the last 15 years.

1mg0sfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_OutlawWriter/comments/1mg0sfw/a_rockbreakers_tale_part_three/,A Rockbreaker's tale: Part Three,"Brenton's eyes locked on the small, metallic disk that Myranda held up. He leaned forward but that didn't help him identify the object. There was no image of a world leader or writing in any language he had ever seen. What he was looking at was far different, a series of small spirals adorning the front of the round, clearly manufactured metal thing. There were four of them, and in the same configuration as the dots on the number four side of a die. He reached out and she allowed him to take the coin from her. He turned it over.

On the reverse side, there was a simple starburst pattern stamped into the metal.

“Have you showed this to anyone else?” he asked.

“A few people. I showed Dominique when I first found it, and she took photos and shot them up the ladder, but I never heard anything back.” she retorted.

He handed the coin back and she replaced it in the box, returning that to the shelf inside the cabinet before turning back to him.

“Where do you think it came from?” the man pressed a little bit.

“I honestly don't know.” she said with a soft exhalation of breath.

The conversation kind of stalled, and eventually the subject changed as the woman broke into her own liquor cabinet and poured a bit of cheap vodka into a pair of weighted glasses. She disappeared for a second and returned with a small bottle of orange juice, mixing them the same drink they had been enjoying before. After he finished his beverage he left her room and made his way along the hallway, teetering on his feet again as he moved. He did make it to his bed before he collapsed, though when he woke, he was still wearing his boots.

He quickly pulled those off along with his clothes and rushed through a shower, before checking in at the mining office and getting helped into the exosuit. He ran the tests on the oxygen and filtration systems before getting the coordinates for the grid he would be working in before joining the others in the airlock. The foreman closed the inner door and then pressed another button on the door. Just as the day before, gravity just disappeared and they began to gently float. They all glanced down at the navigation computers on their wrists.

Once outside of the station, they all used the small gas jets to start moving through the vacuum toward their respective coordinates. Brenton couldn't stop gawking through the impact resistant window on the front of his helmet, glancing at massive chunks of ice and rock floating around him as he fired his jets again, propelling himself forward. He reached the chunk that he was meant to cut into that day and again toggled the little gas nozzles, lifting his tool to his shoulder as he had been taught and the display appeared on the surface of his helmet.

When the reticles appeared along a vein of ore, he pointed the laser at the first point and depressed the lever-like trigger. The beam of light hit the rock, and he guided the beams along the seam and eventually freed his quarry from its stone matrix prison. He placed that into the mesh bag and moved on. He was constantly on the look out for things that didn't belong, but as his shift passed, he didn't find anything besides iron ore and some quartz crystal. He had filled and strapped four of the mesh bags to the cart before entering the airlock.

The door closed behind the group and they waited until the inner door to open before they deactivated their oxygen systems, twisting their helmets slightly to break the seal before removing them. The filtration system eliminated the need to remove the suits to heed the call of nature, but Brenton did it anyway, donning a plain blue jumpsuit and then took his place in line. He would have to eat a little more quickly than the members of his group who opted to remain suited up but he didn't mind. Using the urinal or toilet a more appealing prospect than a leisurely pace.

They all talked a little as they shoveled the food into their mouths and cast nervous glances to either their wrists or the clock on the far wall. Brenton stood and hurried to the toilet, then into the room where he stripped away the coveralls and got suited up again, recruiting Myranda to help him suit up as she walked into the locker room. Once his suit was properly sealed beneath the gauntlets and his helmet was back on, as was hers they made their way to the airlock, meeting up with the others. Once again they were released into the vast expanse.

Once again, his thrusters nudged him along the route he had been given. He reached the chunk of rock, this one much larger than the last two that he had to cut into. Was scanning the area, waiting for the reticle to appear when something strange caught his eye. A glassy flash from below where he hovered. Brent raised the laser drill to his shoulder and very carefully sliced around the object that had thrown back the beam of his light from his helmet. It took him a few minutes, but he managed to free the thing, a sense of excitement rising in his chest.

His mind began to run away with him for a second, imagining that he'd found something like what Myranda had showed him the night before. He was disappointed when he looked at the object in his hand and found a rather plain looking piece of glassy crystal. He tucked that into one of the zipper pockets of the exosuit. If nothing else he could keep the piece of mineral as a sort of memento of his time off of Earth. He continued his work, constantly scanning the surface of the rock for anything out of place.

He found a few other cool pieces of crystal and even a small chunk of raw ruby as he was cutting a quartz spire from the rock, the dirty, green gem just sitting next to the root of the large crystal. He again tucked that into a pocket and then he concentrated in slicing the quartz down so that it would fit in the bag, carrying that back to the cart just as the end of shift tone chimed in his helmet. He navigated his way back into the airlock and twisted his helmet off as he moved back into the station. He emptied the pockets of the suit and took a quick shower while the items ran through the sanitizer.

He dressed in his usual off-duty clothing of jeans and a loose t-shirt branded with one of his favorite bands, the name almost indecipherable above the image of a twisted almost angelic figure with burning wings before he made his way to the break room, his curiosity about the old arcade cabinets and other slightly outdated entertainment equipment had piqued and he wandered to the upright gaming cabinets first.

He found one that he had been familiar with as a kid and was almost a little too excited to find that this machine, like all the others was on free play mode. He played a few rounds before he became aware of footsteps approaching him. He turned to see Myranda.

“You're actually not vegetating in your room.” she said with a playful tone in his voice, coincidentally right around the time that his computer controlled opponent got the better of him. He turned to her with a smile.

“That is getting boring.” Brent said honestly, shoulders rising and falling in a sort of a shrug.

“Yeah, there isn't a whole lot to do out here.” she agreed, the room beginning to fill up with some of the other members of their group as well as a few people from the administration office.

“What do you guys do to blow off steam besides drink and talk through movies?” he teased.

“Some of us play games, others have ways of getting access to the upper rings, and most of the time they hang out up there.” she answered.

He nodded and glanced around, walking toward one of the tables.

“You want a cup of coffee?” he asked as he walked toward the counter where the machine sat, bypassing the table.

She settled into one of the chairs as she called out.

“Half a cup of cream and two sugars, if you will.”

He made himself a cup of plain black coffee and fitted the little plastic lid onto it, and then he poured some of the dark bean water into another paper cup and poured a bit of the non-dairy creamer and two small cubes of sugar before picking up a small plastic stick, swirling the mixture together before he put a lid on that too, and carried it over to the table.

“So... Why did you take this job, anyway?” the girl asked as she accepted her drink, placing it in front of herself.

“I always dreamed of working on a space station, and literally spent my life making it a reality.” he said with a shrug.

Myranda nodded, lifting the cup to her lips, taking a cautious drink.

“What about you?” he volleyed back.

“I figured it was better this than working for my father.” she replied and then shifted her gaze away from his face pensively.

He got the feeling that she was uncomfortable suddenly, and was about to change the subject when the arrival of a pair of newcomers drew their attention, along with that of most everyone else in the room. They weren't dressed like anyone else on the station, still wearing their flight suits over dark work shirts of the same charcoal gray color.

“May we speak with Myranda Byron please?” the taller of the pair spoke up after a few seconds.

The woman raised her eyebrows and then her hand.

“That's me.” she called, getting their attention as she stood up, taking her coffee with her as she approached the suits.

“What can I help you with?” she asked as they started moving toward the hall, and out of earshot.

Brenton drank the rest of his coffee and then went back to his room, his curiosity boiling over as he did so. He knew he wouldn't get any answers at that moment, so he pushed all of the questions forming in his mind aside and occupied himself with watching the news feed from Earth. As usual he was inundated with the flow of negative stories, and quickly grew bored of hearing it. He switched off the screen and examined the little crystals and stones he had kept for himself.

He sat those on one of the barren shelves. He knew he would have to collect them and take them with him when he went back down to the planet, but for the next six months, this is where he would display his collection rather than hiding it away in a box. He settled down at the table and actually wrote a letter on a piece of paper, sealing that in an envelope before he stood and left the room, entering one of the elevators, traveling to the top-most ring. Once he stepped into the curved hallway, he followed the sign to the post office.

He was slightly surprised to find other people standing in the line, sending things back home as well. The man stepped forward as the people in front of him did so as well and as he approached the low counter, the older man wearing the the uniform smiled at him.

“How can I help you today?” he asked.

Brenton handed over the letter.

“I just need to send this.” he said with a smile.

The man nodded.

“Badge please?” he asked and Brent didn't hesitate to hold it out, allowing the barcode at the bottom edge of the glossy card to be scanned.

The man placed a stamp that depicted the very station they were standing in and placed it in the small plastic bin next to him.

“It will arrive in about six days.” the employee told him, handing over the receipt.

He glanced at his wrist, and the rumbling in his stomach confirmed it was indeed near meal time. He made his way back down to the lower ring, glad to see Myranda in line ahead of him. He gathered his portions of food and moved along the line and then filled a cup with milk this time around. He then hurried to the same table as his new friend. She grinned when he sat across from her.

“What was that about?” he asked immediately, unable to contains his questions for any longer.

“You know that thing I showed you?” she returned fire, her enthusiasm matching his.

He nodded slowly.

“You mean the coin.” he replied, and it wasn't a question but a statement of fact. He had suspected that the little object had something to do with that visit.

“Mhm. They asked me for it, and are taking it down to Earth to be studied.” she gushed.

“Oh, that's exciting. I assume you're going to be informed of what they find?” he prodded, hoping to push her into spilling at least a few details.

“That's what they said, at least.” she replied, shrugging her shoulders.

He nodded and dropped the subject, his excitement turning to sour disappointment in the back of his throat. He quickly worked through his meal and returned to his room, deciding to turn in early that night. He woke just a second before the door to his room opened and he sat up as a stranger paused in the doorway.

“What is going on?” Brent asked, his voice still thick with sleep as he sat up, rubbing at his eyes.

“Emergency meeting, the whole crew is being called in.” a semi-familiar voice reached his ears as he blinked and tried to get his eyes to focus on the tall figure in the doorway.

It was the foreman of the crew and behind her stood one of the men who had talked to Myranda the day before.

“Give me five minutes, please?” he asked.

When the door closed he forced himself out of bed and into a set of presentable clothing, and then stepped out into the hall, still rubbing at his eyes.

“Head to the cafeteria, the rest of the team will be there soon.” the foreman told him.

He did as he was told, and settled at a table next to Myranda. Neither spoke but he could see the excitement in her eyes.

In day-to-day language, I might call water a different substance from coffee, but it seems this disagrees with its philosophical application. Here's a quote from Bruce Fink on Deleuze:

>If there were two substances of the same type then they would either interact and become one substance or they would not interact and would instead form two separate universes. But for philosophy there has only been one universe to be explained: our universe. So if there are two substances, one transcending the other, they must be different in character. However, although different in character, the two substances must interact. If they did not interact, once again there would be two different universes. The two universes would be universes of different substances rather than the same substance. But they would nevertheless be two universes.

Reading this, is a given ""substance"" just the entire universe that abides the rules we make of it? For example, God must then be a different substance because God is said to be above comprehension. Likewise, dualists must believe the mind/soul is a different substance from the physical. Is this on the right track?  ",0,1754167224.0,askphilosophy,2,0.33,False

Hello! I'm Raven, lovely to meet you through the reading voice in your head. I've been feeling lonely lately (because both of my partners are extremely low maintenance) and would love some text or audio-based company from someone who can eventually evolve into a relationship, assuming the energy is there and that makes sense for us.

**Some really simple guidelines for you:**

\- I live in Europe. If you are open to a (primarily) online/LDR and have some flexible time to make things work, then I am too. Would prefer EU/UK but open to US connections, assuming you are aware of the timezone restrictions and have some flexibility there to make things work.

**- Short term:** Discord is a must.  
**- Long term:** Steam is a must. A gaming computer is a must. Video is a must.

\- Please DO not attempt to unicorn hunt me.  
\- Please do not use me as a work time filler. I know how that feels and I won't entertain it.

\- Ages 25 to 40 only :)

\- I do not enjoy sex-based language unless there's been some mutual agreement that that is where the energy is heading. This is mostly around words of physical body parts - hinting to these things, flirting, banter, are totally on deck and fine, assuming you know how to time them, but please avoid directly commenting on any physical part of yourself or me until we have reached that point.

\- New to poly people are fine - if you want to use a coffee voice date as a time to ask questions and get some clarity, I'm okay to offer that for now. If I get too overwhelmed, I may withdraw that offer, but we all have to start somewhere.  
\- All genders on any gender spectrum are fine.  
\- Left-leaning political views please, but please do not make 98% of our conversations about the injustice in the world. I know the world sucks right now. Lets use this time as an escape, not a time to dive in.  
\- Would prefer to date someone who does not have children - especially children that live at home, because children will always be your primary and I respect that too much to allow myself to get in the way of that.

**Simple things about me:**

\- 36, female aligned, pan/demisexual, autistic/ADHD  
\- I like words of affirmation, quality time and mutual hangouts.  
\- Student, unemployed, broke so not looking to travel anytime soon. Physical touch isn't a big part of my love language which is why our connection will be primarily online unless you are willing to assist in cost/travelling here.  
\- Overweight but working on it.  
\- Love Trance/EDM and have just bought a Mix Deck to learn how to DJ and make my own tracks.  
\- Love Crystals - I have lots. Bonus points if you have any interest in rocks/crystals as well.  
\- Currently nesting with my spouse and have one additional partner. I have identified as poly for the last 5 years. Do not attempt to string me into a monogamous relationship, it will not work.  
\- Non-hierarchy aligned and would like to be treated as an equal partner.

If all of this together makes you even remotely interested in connecting with me, let's do so! Worst thing that happens is that we both waste a little time we otherwise would have wasted on something or someone else.

Send me a message telling me your poly experience so far, your favourite 2 player gaming experience and/or your special interest(s). Any low effort messages will be swiftly deleted from my inbox, so make it count, and I promise I will absolutely return the favor.

A selfie would also be awesome. If I like yours, I'll send one back. :)",0,1754167129.0,polyamoryR4R,3,0.5,False

The moment the SATs were over, I slept with Chase Walker for the first time.

In the heat of it all, I gasped out loud—only to hear him whisper a name that wasn’t mine.

“Maddie…”

But my name is Sierra. Maddie is my twin sister.

I blinked, stunned, and looked up at him. “Who did you just say?”

Chase kept moving, lowering his head to kiss my eyelids. “Sierra,” he murmured, his voice thick, “don’t get distracted. You’re enjoying this, right?”

His rhythm quickened, driving away every ounce of doubt I had left.

Chase was a jock—strong, tireless, and always creative. My body trembled uncontrollably beneath him. I tried to push him away. “Don’t…”

He leaned into my ear, voice hoarse with desire. “Baby, let’s try it on top this time.”

That night, he wore me down—again and again—until I was crying, begging, shaking, and still he didn’t stop.

Not until sunrise did he finally stumble into the bathroom, satisfied.

I lay there, too sore to move, my limbs aching like they didn’t belong to me.

Then his phone on the nightstand started blowing up with notification pings.

Instinctively, I glanced at the screen—and froze.

\[Congrats, Walker! You finally got some last night!\]

My heart dropped. I couldn’t stop myself. I unlocked his phone and opened the group chat.

What I saw made my entire body go numb.

He’d sent a photo of the bloodstained hotel bedsheet. In the middle of the night.

The messages came in a flood:

\[Holy crap, Chase—you really did it with Sierra? I thought you were into Maddie?\]

\[C’mon, they’re twins. Same face, same body. He’s just warming up with Sierra before he goes all in with Maddie. Practice makes perfect, right?\]

\[Exactly. He’s in love with Maddie. Sierra’s just a stand-in so he doesn’t screw it up with the real thing.\]

Every word felt like a slap.

I’d spent hours wondering why Chase liked me. I’d imagined a thousand reasons—none of them this.

Chase wasn’t just a jock. He was the school's golden boy, surrounded by friends and admiration.

I was the quiet one. The bookworm everyone ignored.

We shouldn’t have had anything in common. But one day back in junior year, during gym, I’d accidentally bled through my pants from my period.

Chase had taken off his team jacket and wrapped it around my waist.

Since then, he’d left breakfast on my desk every morning. Tucked handwritten notes in my school loker.

I’d fallen—hard. But I never understood why someone like him would choose someone like me.

So one day I asked, “What do you like about me?”

He smiled and said, “Because you’re you.”

That first love, the kind you believe will last forever—I’d given it my all.

I thought losing my virginity to him meant something.

Turns out, it was just a performance. A carefully orchestrated “first time,” for his benefit.

I clenched my fists so tightly my knuckles turned white, my palms streaked with red. But nothing hurt more than my heart.

The water stopped running. I rushed to put his phone back and pretend nothing happened.

The door opened. Chase walked out, dripping water, a towel slung low on his hips. His tanned skin glistened with drops, muscles sculpted and bare.

“You’re up. Hungry?”

He came to the bed, voice gentle, eyes dark with something I couldn’t name. He glanced down at the bruises on my collarbone.

I couldn’t answer. All I could hear was the echo of his voice last night—calling me Maddie.

“I’m not hungry.”

He saw the redness at the corners of my eyes and immediately pulled me into his arms. “Did I hurt you? I didn’t mean to—I just… I was new to this. I’ll get better. We can keep practicing.”

His hand slid under my shirt again.

I flinched away. “Don’t. I’m sore.”

He paused, then slowly smoothed down my wrinkled collar, his voice soft with guilt. “I lost control last night. Have some rest, I’ll go downstairs and grab you breakfast.”

He got dressed and left.

I stared at the blood on the white sheets and felt my entire body go hollow.

For two years, we’d been secretly dating. I’d hidden everything from my teachers, from my friends. I did everything he asked, said yes to everything.

He wanted Columbia, so I made it my dream too.

He held my hand under the desk during class; I blushed and kept reciting vocab.

He asked to meet me behind the field after study hall; I gave him my first kiss.

Now the exams were over, he wanted a symbolic “rite of passage,” and I gave him everything.

I thought it was love.

But it was just rehearsal.

If Maddie was who he loved from the beginning, then I didn’t want to love him anymore. I didn’t want to be the stand-in.

I got dressed and left the hotel.

At a pharmacy down the street, I awkwardly asked the clerk for emergency contraceptive pills.

She eyed me up and down, frowning, and pulled a box from the shelf. “You should’ve had your boyfriend use protection. These are awful for your body, you know.”

My face burned. I could barely speak.

There were condoms in the drawer beside the bed. I’d told Chase to grab a box.

But he’d just moaned in my ear, red-eyed and desperate.

“Sierra… it feels weird with that stuff on. Please, just this once. I swear I won’t go too far.”

I gave in.

And now here I was, buying back my freedom one pill at a time.

“Thanks,” I told the clerk as I paid. “Just this once.”

Never again.

Never again would I believe anything Chase Walker said.

# Chapter2

I had barely stepped out of the pharmacy when I heard whispers behind me.

“Just like a hooker.”

“She looked so sweet… But...Unbelievable.”

Their words lashed across my face like a whip, burning hot from my cheeks all the way to my chest.

I hurried away, clutching the paper bag, my vision blurring. At the bus stop, I washed down the white pill with a bottle of water.

I drank too fast. The water caught in my throat, and I started coughing so hard my eyes watered.

“Sierra!”

Chase came running up, out of breath, worry etched into every feature.

“Why’d you leave the hotel without telling me? I texted, I called. Where have you been?”

The way he said it—like I was the one being cruel—it almost made me laugh.

Almost.

But all I felt was this sharp, twisting ache in my chest.

“I went to buy emergency contraception,” I said, holding up the now-empty pill box.

His expression faltered. Embarrassment crept into his eyes.

“You could’ve told me. Or let me go get it. I was worried.”

I didn’t want to argue over this. “It won’t happen again.”

He sensed something was off. He reached for my hand. “I’m sorry I lost control last night. I’ll be more careful next time.”

Then he smiled. “Hey, the Class President is throwing a graduation party at Capital Square. Come with me?”

I pulled my hand back. “No one knows we’re together. It’s better if we go separately.”

Chase stiffened. After a moment, he nodded.

“Okay. I’ll grab a cab.”

I didn’t reply. I just got on the next bus.

He had promised we’d go public after the SATs.

But for the past few days, while he chatted away in the group chat, not once had he mentioned me.

And I’d already seen the truth in that secret text thread with his friends.

There was no relationship to announce.

By the time I got to the private dining room at Capital Square, the place was packed.

Maddie, dressed in a pink Lolita-style dress, sat surrounded like some Disney princess. Chase was right next to her, peeling cherries and handing them to her one by one.

A few classmates started teasing, “Chase, you’ve been so good to the Prom Queen all year. You better shoot your shot before college. Once you get to Columbia, there’ll be too many options!”

Everyone had seen how good Chase was to Maddie.

Even though he was secretly dating me, publicly, he was always by Maddie’s side—helping her clean up after class, saving her a spot in the lunch line, carrying her books.

He was even the one who rallied the guys to vote her Prom Queen.

But we were twins. We looked almost identical.

Back then, he’d explained, “Maddie’s got a weaker constitution. People tend to bully her. You’re stronger, Sierra. You have me.”

I actually believed it. I believed he loved me so much, he was kind to my sister too.

Looking back now, I was embarrassingly naive. How could I have missed such a lame excuse?

I pushed the door open and walked in.

Chase looked up. His expression didn’t change—not even a flicker of guilt.

Maddie immediately stood and rushed to my side. “Sierra! You didn’t come home last night. Mom and Dad were freaking out. Where were you?”

Everyone turned to look at me, whispering behind their drinks.

“Seriously? Hooking up with someone the night after SATs? Yikes.”

“Thought she was a brainiac. Guess she’s wild behind the scenes.”

Maddie wore a look of innocent concern, but her eyes gleamed with satisfaction.

I saw right through her.

“It’s none of your business,” I said calmly, trying to walk past her.

But she latched onto my arm like a loving little sister. “Sit next to me. The seat is available.”

She tugged a little too hard, and my collar slipped.

The marks Chase had left on me the night before were on full display—bruised and violet, unmistakable.

Maddie gasped. “Sierra, what happened to you?”

Every gaze in the room locked onto me—shocked, curious, judgmental.

“So much for the innocent honor student…”

“Jesus, how rough was it? Look at those hickeys.”

“She’s not even dating anyone, is she? Must’ve been some random hookup after finals.”

Face burning, I yanked my collar back into place and turned instinctively toward Chase.

He didn’t even look at me.

He was still talking with Maddie, his face soft, gentle… like none of this had anything to do with him.

My heart hardened.

“It’s nothing,” I said coolly. “Got bit by a dog. I’m allergic.”

A worthless stray dog, at that.

# Chapter3

Laughter erupted around the room as everyone joked about which mangy mutt had left those “bite marks” on me.

Chase’s face darkened. He knocked on the table. “Everyone’s here. Let’s get started.”

His voice cut through the noise instantly.

The Class President quickly stood up to ease the awkwardness. “Yeah, enjoy yourself. We’ll all be heading our separate ways soon—college, work, wherever. Might be the last time we’re all in the same room.”

People started sharing their summer plans.

Some were heading south for factory jobs. Some had graduation trips booked. Others were rushing to get their driver’s licenses.

Dinner wrapped up, and the party moved into a private karaoke lounge.

We played games. One of them was a dare.

Maddie got picked and had to choose a guy to give her a princess carry for a full minute.

The guys immediately started cheering. Maddie blushed and glanced at Chase. “Chase, can you help me?”

Without a word, Chase leaned down, one arm slipping behind her knees, muscles flexing as he lifted her effortlessly into the air.

“Hold on tight.”

Maddie let out a soft gasp, wrapping her arms around his neck, her laughter sugary-sweet.

“Damn, Walker’s a beast! No wonder he’s on varsity!”

I looked away, curling my fingers into fists beneath the table. I tried to pretend it didn’t bother me.

Then it was my turn.

The dare? Take three shots of vodka—or kiss any guy in the room.

The guys all grinned, already whispering.

I instinctively glanced at Chase.

He avoided my eyes.

“I already played knight tonight,” he said flatly. “I’m sitting out the rest.”

The words hit like a slap.

I picked up the shot glass and knocked it back.

Then another.

Then another.

The vodka burned down my throat like acid. My eyes stung. I stumbled out of the room and into the bathroom, barely making it to the sink before throwing it all up.

I splashed water on my face, rinsed my mouth over and over until the burning eased.

When I looked up, the mirror showed a mess.

Red eyes. Hair tangled. Collar askew, with faint bruises peeking out beneath the fabric.

I looked like a clown.

I tugged my clothes straight, brushed out my hair, and gave myself the most pathetic smile I could muster.

“Sierra Hayes,” I whispered, “pain teaches you lessons. You’ll be better because of this. Pull youself together.”

I didn’t go back into the room.

I texted the Class President that I was heading home and left.

On the bus, I pulled out my phone and opened our old iMessage thread.

\[Sierra, I like you. Will you be my girlfriend?\]

\[Sierra, I couldn’t sleep again tonight. I kept thinking about you. I miss you.\]

Dozens of sweet nothings. Dozens of selfies—Chase posing with his bike, dunking at the school court, us walking to school in our Westhaven High uniforms.

When I got a new phone last year, I refused to delete any of it.

But now…

With trembling fingers, I selected the entire chat.

6.9 GB. Delete?

Yes.

Everything we had—all our memories, all his empty words—were gone with a tap.

It was like we were never anything at all.

The bus pulled to a stop. I wiped my face and stood up.

I walked home.

The second I stepped through the front door, a sharp slap knocked me to the floor.

My ears rang.

“You shameless brat!” my father roared. “Staying out all night and drinking like some party girl? ”

Half my face throbbed with heat. My head spun as I looked up from the floor—only to see Maddie and Mom sitting on the couch, watching it all with smug satisfaction.

I wiped the blood from the corner of my mouth.

“The Class President threw the party,” I rasped. “I only had a little, and I threw it all up. Maddie can vouch for me.”

But Maddie blinked, all innocence. “He did throw the party, but Sierra left halfway without saying anything. I can’t back her up.”

Mom’s face hardened.

“Sierra Hayes, how many times have I told you to learn from your sister? If you do, your father wouldn’t be this upset.”

I knelt on the floor, my cheek red and swollen.

They sat hand in hand on the sofa. Picture perfect.

My eyes drifted to the coffee table.

There sat a vacation contract: “Westhaven Students Celebrate SAT Success – 3-Person Family Trip to Cancun!”

My heart dropped.

My parents’ names were signed. So was Maddie’s.

“You’re taking Maddie on a trip… and leaving me behind?” I asked.

Mom’s eyes flickered. “Maddie won it in a school raffle. There are only three spots. We’re going with her because it’s fair.”

“You can stay home and think about your behavior. We’ll take you next time.”

I gave a cold smile. “And when exactly is next time?”

Maddie had always been the fragile one. The doctors said I’d stolen her nutrients in the womb.

Since then, my parents had spoiled her relentlessly.

When I won a doll in elementary school, Maddie said she liked it. Mom made me give it to her.

When there were only a few drumsticks or Buffalo wings left at dinner, Maddie got first pick. I got whatever was left.

Every time, Mom said, “Next time means next time. Be the bigger sister.”

But that “next time” never came.

She didn’t answer.

Dad raised his hand again, ready to strike.

“What? Go to your room. You’re grounded.”

I stumbled up the stairs, clutching the wall as pain echoed through my chest.

Not long after, a text came in from Mr. Carter.

\[Sierra, come to school tomorrow morning. We’ll go over your SAT scores and work on your college major declaration.\]

\[Okay.\]

I curled up in bed, holding the phone.

This was my chance.

College wasn’t just a way out—it was my way forward.

Grayson Whitaker’s sugar baby had a nasty habit of disappearing.



And every time she got dragged back, that woman would immediately pin the blame on Savannah Langley.



The ninth time she went missing, Grayson locked Savannah inside the steam room.



As the glass door clicked shut, the scalding air hit like a thousand tiny needles piercing her skin.



The temperature needle kept climbing.



140°F…



160°F…



180°F…



Savannah’s face flushed crimson, her breath snagging in her throat.



Grayson stood outside the glass, slowly turning the ring on his finger. His voice was low, deadly calm. “Last chance. Tell me—where the hell is Maddie?”



Savannah threw herself against the glass, pounding with everything she had. The heat seared her palms, leaving bloody imprints that dried instantly on contact.



“I don’t know! I swear, I don’t know!”



Her throat felt like it was tearing open. “Grayson, please… let me out… I can’t take much more…”



She had a congenital heart condition. Surviving into her twenties had already been a miracle—trapped in that kind of heat, she could die at any moment.



But Grayson acted like he didn’t hear a word. He tapped the temperature control with his finger. “It’s just a steam session. You won’t die. Compared to how you bullied Maddie, this is nothing.”



“Still won’t talk?” The moment his finger pressed the button, Savannah felt her heartbeat go berserk. “Fine. Let’s crank it up some more.”



Her mind blurred, but suddenly she remembered something—two days ago, Madeline had posted a location on her story.



She summoned her last ounce of strength. “I’ll talk! Northcrest Amusement Park… the utility room!”



Grayson turned on his heel and rushed out the door. But not before tossing an order to his men, “Don’t let her out until I say so.”



Half an hour later, the call finally came.



He’d found Madeline. Only then did they let Savannah out.



She was drenched in sweat, burning up with fever, and collapsed into unconsciousness for the rest of the night.



All through that feverish haze, memories of Grayson flickered through her mind like a reel on fast-forward.



He’d been her father’s old friend, always hanging around when she was just a timid little girl.



She’d always been frail, barely able to eat. Grayson would show up like some magician, bringing fresh fruit and vegetables from all over the world.



Pineberries from South America. Horned melons from Africa. Picked at dawn and served at noon, straight to her plate.



Those high-fashion couture gowns celebrities fought tooth and nail over—easily worth hundreds of thousands—he’d send them over like casual gifts, all because she once said, “That’s pretty.”



Her father would ruffle her hair and joke, “I swear, this boy’s gonna snatch you up and marry you one day.”



She’d always protest, “No way,” but her face would flush as red as a tomato.



On her eighteenth birthday, Grayson made a scene the entire city would never forget.



He covered the streets in her favorite white roses. Drones spelled out “Savannah, marry me” across the skies of Crestmoor Heights. The message stayed up there for three whole days and nights.



On a luxurious yacht, he wrapped her in his arms from behind, burying his chin in her shoulder.



“Baby, say yes. This life, the next, and the one after that—I’ll love you forever.”



Under a sky exploding with fireworks, Savannah said yes through her tears.



But less than six months later, everything fell apart. The Langley family went bankrupt. Her father died from the strain. On his deathbed, he grabbed Grayson’s hand, barely breathing.



“Take care of Savannah… don’t ever hurt her…”



Grayson gave him a solemn nod. “I promise.”



After that, Savannah moved into the Whitaker estate.



Everyone in Crestmoor Heights knew—Grayson gave Savannah everything.



Until Madeline Rhodes came along.



The new assistant—clumsy as hell, couldn’t even peel shrimp without help.



“She’s just a little dumb. Can’t even peel shrimp,” Grayson chuckled.



“She always forgets her paperwork too.”



That was the first time he mentioned Madeline in front of her. His tone was gentle, indulgent. It burned. Right through her chest.



Madeline swapped out his imported oolong for instant coffee, tanked a billion-dollar deal, and Grayson just ruffled her hair and laughed, “She’s just naive. Innocent and a little headstrong—that’s all.”



She ruined a limited-edition dress from Savannah’s closet by spilling ink on it. Grayson didn’t even blink—he had a new one delivered to Madeline the same day.



Even on Savannah’s twenty-first birthday, while cutting her cake, Grayson suddenly paused mid-slice.



“Maddie loves blueberry cake…”



“If she were here, she’d throw a fit just to eat the whole thing.”



In that moment, something inside Savannah shattered completely.



That woman—Madeline Rhodes—had already taken up permanent residence in Grayson’s heart. There was no room left for her.



Madeline moved in, playing every petty game she could think of. Savannah swallowed her pride and pretended not to care.



Then Madeline started her deliberate little vanishing acts. Each time, she’d drop a clue just for Savannah, tilt her head, and smile.



“Wanna guess? Will Grayson tear you apart just to get me back?”



She played this game eight times. Savannah lost all eight.



In her dreams, Grayson’s cold, accusing face got closer and closer until she jolted awake, drenched in sweat.



Staring out the window, Savannah suddenly felt so, so tired.



The man she once clung to like salvation—he was long gone.



She pulled out the acceptance letter buried at the bottom of her trunk and dialed a number.



“Professor Grant? I’m coming. I’ll be Montclair in time for the new term.”

# Chapter 2

“You’re really going through with this?” Professor Grant sounded genuinely surprised. “With your health… will your family even allow it?”



Savannah had thought about leaving before—but every single time, Grayson shut her down.



At first, he’d coax her with a gentle tone. “Be good, Savannah. You’re too fragile. I don’t feel safe letting you go so far. Once your health improves, I’ll take you around the world myself.”



Later on, the patience was gone. Just a cold frown. “Your dad entrusted you to me. I’m responsible for you. Stop making things difficult.”



Because of that, she’d never dared to mention her acceptance to an overseas college.



“I don’t have family anymore,” Savannah said with a bitter curve of her lips. “I just want to try living for myself this time, Professor.”



There was a long sigh on the other end. “Alright. The semester starts in a week. You better start packing.”



The second she hung up, the front door downstairs slammed open.



Grayson stormed in like a blizzard, cold rage radiating off him in waves.



Without a word, he grabbed Savannah by the wrist and dragged her toward the door. His grip crushed into the burn on her palm, making her wince in pain.



“Where are you taking me?!” she struggled.



“To apologize to Maddie.”



Savannah’s stomach dropped. “For what?”



“Maddie was kidnapped because of you. Sprained her ankle.” His voice was sharp as a blade. “She cried all night in the hospital. Her eyes are still swollen. You started this—you owe her an apology.”



Savannah let out a short, humorless laugh.



That’s it? A sprained ankle?



“That wasn’t me,” she said, forcing calm through the pressure in her chest. “I just saw the location Madeline posted on her story, and—”



She cut herself off.



Because she saw it—clearly—in Grayson’s eyes. Anger. Suspicion. A flicker of disgust.



Just like the eight times before. He didn’t believe her.



“Go on,” he sneered. “Keep spinning your little lies. Savannah, your father was the kindest man I ever knew. How the hell did he raise a daughter this vicious?”



It was the first time he’d mentioned her father since the funeral.



And he used it to spit venom at her.



He didn’t give her a second to react. One kick knocked over the bookshelf beside them. Books crashed everywhere.



“You’re not getting out of this. Apologize willingly—or I’ll drag you there myself.”



In the chaos, Madeline suddenly limped in through the door. Her eyes were red, voice trembling. “Grayson, don’t blame Savannah…”



Her lashes fluttered pitifully as tears streamed down her face.



“It’s my fault… I wandered off… This has nothing to do with her…”



Then—dramatically—she dropped to her knees in front of Savannah.



Grayson’s expression changed in an instant. Eyes red, he shoved Savannah aside and bent down to scoop Madeline into his arms.



She wriggled weakly, whispering, “Grayson… put me down. I should be the one apologizing. It’s all my fault. I ruined everything. I deserve to be punished.”



He laid her down on the couch—almost tenderly. Then turned around. When his eyes met hers again, they were pure flame.“Happy now, Savannah? Look what you’ve done to her.”



Savannah clenched her blistered hand so hard the pain nearly made her faint. It was the only thing keeping her from crying.



The next second, Grayson yanked her forward, shoving her down by the shoulder. “Get on your knees. Apologize. Say you were wrong—and we’ll let it go.”



Savannah stiffened, spine straight as steel.



“No?” His voice dropped lower. “Then ten days in the silence chamber. Copy the Doctrine of Obedience by hand.”



She flinched.



Ever since Madeline started vanishing on purpose, Grayson loved locking her in that windowless, candle-lit room. Forced her to transcribe the same damned texts until her fingers cramped.



The darkness, the silence—it carved away pieces of her soul each time.



She only had seven days left before leaving. She couldn’t risk this ruining everything.



Shame crashed over her. Gritting her teeth, she bowed her head low.



“I’m sorry, Miss Rhodes.”



Only then did Madeline offer her hand with a saccharine smile. “Don’t be like that, Savannah. I forgave you ages ago.”



The second Savannah stood, Madeline leaned in close, her voice a venomous whisper against her ear. “Looks like I win. Again.”



Savannah staggered back a step and bent down to pick up her backpack, which had been knocked to the floor during the chaos.



As she reached for it, something slid out of the open zipper and fluttered to the carpet. Her acceptance letter.



Grayson moved fast. Snatched it off the ground and frowned as he looked it over. Then he lifted his eyes to her, expression dark and sharp.



“What the hell is this?”

# Chapter 3

Savannah's heart dropped. She lunged forward, knocking Grayson to the ground, and snatched the acceptance letter from his hand.



“Just—just materials for an art project. Nothing important.”



Grayson frowned as he got up, brushing dust off his suit jacket.



“Savannah, you’re not a kid anymore. Keep your hands to yourself.”



“There’s a dinner party tomorrow night. Clean yourself up. You’re coming with me.”



Savannah didn’t want to go, but she had to keep a low profile.



For the next seven days, she had to act like nothing had changed.



The Whitaker family’s car pulled up in front of the hotel. As soon as Savannah stepped out, she heard the host’s voice from the door.



“Mr. Whitaker, it’s been ages. And the young lady with you—such elegance. I assume this is your fiancée, Miss Langley?”



Madeline, dressed in a custom scarlet gown with jewels glittering on her neck, giggled behind her perfectly manicured fingers.



“Oh, Mr. Townsend, you’re teasing. I’m just Mr. Whitaker’s assistant.”



She batted her lashes toward Savannah, her words laced with poison. “At least I’m healthy and easy on the eyes. Not... fragile like Miss Langley.”



Grayson chuckled and tapped Madeline’s nose fondly. “Sweet talker. Just remember, not everyone’s as tolerant as I am.”



Madeline stuck her tongue out, leaning into his shoulder. “I’m just telling the truth… unless, of course, you’re hoping I’ll be something more than just your assistant?”



Savannah couldn’t watch any longer. She turned to leave.



“The party’s about to start. Where are you going?” Grayson snapped.



“ Don’t throw a tantrum in public. Are you trying to embarrass me?” He walked off with Madeline in his arms, never once glancing back.



Savannah trailed a few paces behind. Her simple white dress looked painfully out of place among the glitter and glamour—like she was someone’s help.



People in these circles loved to kick you when you’re down. Seeing how Grayson treated her, others didn’t bother hiding their contempt either.



A few rounds in, a visibly intoxicated Brandon Rowe lumbered over—the eldest son of the Rowe family.



Swirling his whiskey, he leaned in to touch Savannah’s chin. “Well, if it isn’t the little Langley girl. Used to be locked away like some princess in a tower. Gotta say, up close… you’re even softer than I imagined.”



Savannah recognized him immediately.



Back when she rarely left the house, Brandon and his crew would linger outside her window, calling her a 'sickly little tease’—the kind who’d surprise you once the lights went out.



Grayson once stormed into the Rowe estate and beat him within an inch of his life.



Clearly, Brandon hadn’t let it go.



She stumbled back, but he was faster—one hand grabbing her waist, the other already sliding up her thigh.



“Stop pretending to be some untouchable princess. Your man’s got a new toy now—you’re yesterday’s trash. I’m the only one who’d still want you.”



Savannah panicked. She grabbed a wine glass from the table and threw the drink in his face.



Brandon dropped to the floor, screaming, “What the hell?! You little bitch!”



The scuffle drew every eye—conversations cut off, glasses frozen mid-air.



Madeline, standing beside Grayson, gasped in mock surprise. “Savannah, what are you doing?! The Rowe family is one of Whitaker Corp’s major partners. Are you trying to ruin the deal?”



Grayson’s expression darkened instantly.



Madeline quickly asked a server to fetch a towel, crouched to help Brandon up, and fussed over him with practiced sweetness. “I’m so sorry, everyone. Savannah hasn’t been out in a while. She’s just... not used to people.”



“If anyone’s at fault, it’s me. I should’ve kept a closer eye on her. She’s still recovering, after all.”



A wave of whispers surged around the room.



“Heart condition or not, that doesn’t excuse her behavior. Probably just a spoiled brat who never grew up.”



“She’s only still standing because of the Whitakers. Without them, no one would tolerate her attitude.”



“Fell from high society and brought the drama with her. Even the assistant has more class.""



""Poor Grayson—stuck with a hysterical mess like that.""



Brandon, emboldened by the support, scoffed, “Mr. Whitaker, how are we settling this?”



The whispers crashed over her like a wave. Savannah turned to Grayson, her voice cracking. “Please… just this once. Believe me. He came at me first. I only—”



“Oh, Miss Langley,” Brandon interrupted smugly. “Slander won’t get you anywhere. The Rowes still have a name to protect. Unless someone saw it, it didn’t happen.”



Silence. No one stepped in.



Grayson didn’t even look at Savannah. He walked straight to Brandon. “Three extra points on the Westside project. Call it an apology.”



Brandon’s grin widened. “Now we’re talking. Might want to leash your woman tighter.”



Just like that, Savannah was branded a spoiled, violent mess.



She stood there, humiliated—first assaulted, now betrayed.



“Grayson.” Her voice trembled. “Just once. You won’t even trust me once?”



“Don't tell me you think you're some untouchable goddess.”



Grayson turned, sneering. “Brandon swore on his family’s name he’d never touch you. Not even a finger.”



He grabbed her arm and dragged her behind a pillar, throwing her against the wall.



“I know you’re still mad about Maddie. So what—now you’re trying to use the Rowes to get back at me? Fine, I’ll pay the price. But your obsession with destroying her is pitiful.”",1,1754166706.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

# Summary of The System:

1. What You Want to Achieve (Your Main Goal)  
2. The Few Actions You’ll Take Tomorrow  
3. Why You Want It (Emotional Fuel)  
4. Cues & Triggers  
5. Mindset Shift: Imagine It’s Already Done

# Why Does Setting a Goal, And Knowing Why You Want It, Actually Matter?

There’s a reason every great transformation starts with a simple question: “Why?”  
As Simon Sinek says, you have to “start with why”, because when you’re clear on what you want (and why you want it), you unlock a source of energy that makes everything else easier.

But it’s deeper than motivation or positive thinking.  
Intentions have energy.  
Setting your “why” before sleep doesn’t just organize your mind, It quietly shapes your reality.  
Neuroscience shows your subconscious goes to work on any problem or desire you give it, even while you’re asleep.

If you write down a real goal, and connect it to a reason that matters, you’re literally programming your mind to make it happen, often in ways you can’t see yet.

And here’s the wildest part:  
When you go to bed with your “why” in mind, your brain doesn’t just rest, It builds pathways, spots patterns, and solves for you.

You wake up with more clarity, better ideas, and a new level of confidence.  
When your why is strong, your how gets easy.  
So every night, before you sleep, ask:

* What do I want, really?
* Why does it matter to me right now?

# Why Do Actions, Cues(Triggers) Actually Work?

Ever wonder why some people seem to just do what matters, while the rest of us get stuck, overthink, or procrastinate?  
It’s not willpower. It’s not “motivation.”  
It’s systems. Specifically, it’s the cues and triggers that shape what you actually do, almost automatically.

Both “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg and “Atomic Habits” by James Clear reveal the same law:  
Every habit is built on a loop: Cue, Routine, Reward.

* Cue: What sparks the behavior (a time, place, feeling, or notification).
* Routine: The actual action you want to make automatic.
* Reward: The payoff, even if it’s just checking something off.

# Here’s Why This Matters (and Reduces Stress):

When you decide your few key actions for tomorrow before sleep, and link them to specific cues (like “after I pour my coffee” or “right after my first meeting”), you’re:

* Pre-loading the day with clarity.
* Making the action obvious and easy (no friction, no forgetting).
* Letting your brain run on autopilot, instead of “forcing” yourself all day.

This destroys stress, because you don’t have to keep remembering, negotiating, or overthinking.  
You just do the thing, when the trigger hits.  
And every time you act on your cue, you get a tiny win , which creates momentum (the secret sauce of lasting change).

# Pro Tip:

Your triggers can be anything you already do, brushing your teeth, walking the dog, checking your phone , or even a simple notification or alarm.  
Replacing bad habits? The easiest way is to change the cue. But that’s a whole story for another post.

Bottom line:  
Choosing your next actions and linking them to real cues, right before sleep, automates half your day , so you act without effort and build unstoppable momentum, one micro-win at a time.

# The Tiny Mindset Shift: Why Your “Future Self” Is Your Secret Weapon

There’s one mental shift that separates people who get what they want faster:  
They see themselves as already becoming the person they want to be. They talk to their “future self”, and then act from that identity, not from old habits.

# The Science (And MIT Research)

MIT researchers found that when you vividly imagine your “future self” and even talk to that version of you, your brain literally fires up as if those changes are already happening.  
This isn’t woo-woo. Brain scans show that people who picture their future self as real are far more likely to save money, stick to habits, and bounce back from setbacks.  
You’re not just daydreaming , you’re rewiring your identity, upgrading your decisions, and shrinking the gap between where you are and where you want to go.

# Picturing It Done:

When you imagine your key actions as already finished (before you fall asleep), your brain gets a “certainty signal.”

* You feel the progress.
* Your subconscious believes it’s possible (and starts solving for it overnight).
* You wake up less anxious, more motivated, and with creative solutions ready to go.

# Setbacks? They’re Turning Points, Not Roadblocks.

The ultimate mindset shift is seeing every challenge, failure, or missed habit as a signal — not proof you’re broken, but feedback to grow.

* Missed an action? Future You asks: “What’s the upgrade here?”
* Setback? That’s the spot where your next breakthrough is hiding.

Bottom line:  
Combine “Future Self” visualization, tiny mindset tweaks, and a willingness to reframe setbacks as stepping stones, and you create a level of certainty that makes progress automatic.  
You don’t just hope you’ll win , you know you’re on the right path, no matter what.

# How AI Makes This System Effortless (And What Actually Works in 2025)

There’s no shortage of AI-powered tools in 2025. Here are three I’ve actually tried (and what they’re best at):

1. Fabulous  
Fabulous helps you build daily routines and habits, using science-backed journeys, smart reminders, and habit streaks. It’s great if you want to design a healthy morning or evening ritual and love gamified progress.

2. Habitica  
Habitica turns your habits and tasks into a role-playing game. Every time you complete an action, your character levels up. It’s especially good if you’re motivated by rewards, social accountability, and a sense of play.

3. Noviq AI: Meet Future You  
Noviq AI is a bit different, it combines AI-driven reflection, future self conversations, daily planning, and gentle nudges all in one place. Instead of juggling separate apps, you can do your whole 10-minute night ritual just by chatting for a few minutes before sleep.

# What This Means For You:

* You don’t need to juggle apps, notebooks, or “systems.”
* You don’t need to find motivation or memorize hacks.
* You can literally start tonight, for free, by spending 10 minutes before bed.

No more hoping for change. No more solo struggle.  
Just talk, plan, and let AI do the heavy lifting , while you sleep and while you win.",2,1754166468.0,DecidingToBeBetter,0,1.0,False

I’ve spent this past year focusing on myself, growing, healing, and learning. But lately, the idea of a real partner keeps coming up. I miss making a woman feel deeply loved  and everything that comes with a meaningful relationship.

I’m incredibly affectionate, thrive on words of affirmation, and express all love languages. I want someone I can hold and be held by. Someone who loves a deep talk one minute and turns into a complete goof the next. I’m a consistent texter and value clear, kind, and honest communication when things get tough.

A little about me:
I’ve lived coast to coast and always have a bag ready for the next road trip (but let me drive, please). I’m 5’10, tattooed, creative, and can hyper-fixate on an art project for hours thanks to the power of ADHD. I love working with my hands, taking care of people I love, and noticing the little things most people miss.

I’m attracted to femme and chapstick lesbians. Y’all really make my heart race. ✨ I value a partner who takes care of herself (not asking for a gym rat, just some self-love and if I can throw you around that’s a plus 😉. Ideally looking for someone who’s a switch, but I’m happy taking the lead if that’s your comfort zone. Definitely kink-friendly - I’m done with vanilla and ready for something more aligned and expressive. 

I’m down for horror films, documentaries, or a nostalgic Disney night. Music is a constant in my life - I’m rarely without headphones. I propagate plants and give them to people I care about, and my self-care routine is sacred (morning coffee + evening tea = non-negotiable). Being outdoors is my happy place… just not in Arizona heat (lived there, barely survived 😅). 

Last but not least I am a mom to one amazing girl. 

If you’re kind, communicative, flirty, and ready to build something - I’d love to hear from you. Bonus points if you can match my banter. Let’s see where this goes.

I havent read much in my adult life but ive thoroughly enjoyed what i have read so far, and id like some suggestions (standalone novels or series, either is fine, but if a series then id like for it to have already been completed) based on some personal information and the following list of books ive read: 

Dune by Frank Herbert

The Old Man and The Sea by Ernest Hemingway

Stranger in a Strage Land by Robert Heinlen

Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick

Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck

The Stranger by Albert Camus 

The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov

Ishmael by Danien Quinn

Edited to add: Bartleby the Scrivener by Herman Melville

Im currently reading East of Eden by Steinbeck and im loving it, even if i dont fully grasp all of the biblical allusions. Its beautifully written and its scope is really awe inspiring. 

Personal information: im a 29 year old american male living at home due to mental illness. I supposedly read a lot of a child but i dont remember reading all that much. I love cerebral art such as the movies Solaris and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind. Im generally interested in psychology and philosophy, not enough to call myself anything like an expert in either field but i love learning what i can when im up for it. I dont subscribe to any one school of philosophic thought, either. Im an avid music lover but much of my taste falls on the obscure side -- think king crimson, van der graaf generator, magma. I also like old school punk rock bands like bad brains, dead kennedys, gorrilla biscuits, and some of the better known anarcho-punk bands. I actually was a punk until about 20 years old. Im generally apolitical but thats a hard thing for me to maintain these days, not that i wouldnt enjoy a book with political undertones or one that is outright politically subversive. I used to do a lot of drugs (thats probably one of the main reasons i developed schizophrenia) but im pretty much sober now, just the occasional toke of pot and lots of caffeine in the form of coffee and teas and cigarettes. Im trying to spend my ample amount of free time learning and improving my mind and my understanding of people. 

Oh, and im looking for fiction only. Unless its something you think i might really enjoy or be fascinated by. (: 

Edited to add: pleasepleaseplease no recommendations that have anything to do with real life magick. Something like the magic of Lord of the Rings is fine, but ritualistic magick or deity worship is a big no-no for me.

But sometimes, seemingly randomly, something gets clogged and I have to press really hard to get even a tiny high-velocity squirt out of it. In these cases the liquid typically comes out at an angle so I assume it has to do with the valve rather than the filter, but stopping mid-press to gently clean the valve has no effect. In the worst cases, I can’t get any liquid through at all, even if I put the aeropress in the sink and put a significant amount of my weight on it.

Things I’ve tried:

* Cleaning the cap and filter by soaking in warm soapy water and then scrubbing with a sponge

* Changing the grind size of the coffee

* Changing the amount of agitation during the steeping process

The last one maybe has an effect? I think the clogging happens more often if I stir vigorously—e.g. for cold brew—but it still happens sometimes even with no agitation at all.

Has anyone else had this problem? Have you solved it?",1,1754166221.0,AeroPress,2,1.0,False

My sm hasn’t allowed me to train any partners, ever, yet all the new barista trainers after me am have gotten to train. Okay, this seems dramatic but it’s frustrating to me. I became a trainer a few months ago, and since then three others became trainers. These partners have all gotten to train, one started training a few days after completing her trainer training.. yeah, and they have not even worked for a year at the store. I’ve been working for two years at this store, and I get really positive comments from my coworkers, the regulars all love me and some even look for me at the store! The others partners have said I am one of the fastest partners at the store and that I am really great at sequencing. During my shifts, I’m on drive bar during peak 4 out of 5 times a week. I work the most hours per pay period of the other baristas, I know all the routines and prep steps. I feel like I’d be great at training. I’m at the store a lot and know what I’m doing, as a result. Since the time I’ve become a trainer, there have been 7 new baristas that have been trained. None by me. Every time I bring it up to my sm, they say next time and ‘sorry i meant to let you train’. Like what? HUH? I casually ask every few weeks. I’m starting to think that my sm and the other partners all just secretly hate me. They don’t act like they hate me(I don’t think?). I am left out of a lot of the in-store conversations, but I always attributed that to me being very hard-of-hearing and being a bother to try to include, now I’m wondering if it is actually because they just don’t want to talk to me at all? But again, I genuinely don’t think they dislike me at all. I guess I’m just frustrated. I’ve always been told I could do the coffee master training too, yet I’m getting skipped over for that too by two others that asked after me. I was asssigned the training on the schedule but the module wasn’t on my learning, so the sm said they’d set it up on the next schedule. This was over a 
month ago. One partner asked to do it and literally got the apron immediately and this happened without any of the shifts even knowing about it because the partner didn’t do anything. I just don’t get it. Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this? ",2,1754166145.0,starbucksbaristas,0,1.0,False

He doesn't look like a drug user; he seems more like he might have some mental health issues, but it's hard to know for sure. Whenever I can, I give him some change.

Tonight, he asked me if I could buy him something to eat. I said sure, and he went into the same off-license. He grabbed a frozen pizza, then asked if he could get a second one. I told him, ""Sorry, I only have enough change for one."" 
He then asked for a drink and came back with a 500g package of ground coffee. I told him that's not a drink, and I wouldn't pay for it. He then put it back and got a small Coke instead. I paid for the pizza and the Coke, and he left.

I don't mind the money at all, but his behavior has left me with a strange feeling and it made me wonder a few things:
 - Could he be working with the store owner? Maybe the owner lets him hang out and sends people inside to buy things?
 - Is it possible he returns the items for cash?
 - Or am I just overthinking it, and he really just needed food and was hoping to get as much as he could? Maybe he has a family and was trying to get things they all needed.

I'm just curious to know if anyone else has been in a similar situation and what your general thoughts are on this. Thanks!

TL;DR: I bought a homeless guy food, but he tried to get a bunch of items (a second pizza, a package of coffee) that seemed suspicious, making me wonder about his intentions.",0,1754165956.0,london,18,0.47,False

(Limited Time),"Ever find yourself tinkering with AI tools, but you’re not sure how to monetize that curiosity? 🤔 You’re not alone! We all get wrapped up in our tech hobbies, but have you ever considered turning those late-night coding sessions into a little side hustle? 💸

I recently took a deep dive into how to transform my passion for AI into some extra cash, and let me tell you—it's been a wild ride! Here’s the thing: you’d be surprised how many people are ready to pay for your skills, even if you’re still figuring it all out. 

### Here’s a sneak peek into my journey:
- **Started Small**: I began by offering simple AI-driven solutions on platforms like Fiverr and Upwork. You wouldn't believe the variety of requests I got—everything from automating social media posts to creating quirky chatbot responses. 
- **Networking is Key**: Join communities like this one (shout-out to AiContentAutomators 🙌) and connect with fellow enthusiasts. You might find a collaborator or a mentor who can guide you!
- **Showcase Your Work**: Share your projects on social media. You’d be amazed at how showcasing even the simplest AI creations can lead to inquiries about paid gigs. 
- **Educate Others**: Consider creating a simple online course or writing eBooks. Guys, people are *hungry* for knowledge! You could turn your tutorials into cash machines while helping out others on their learning paths.
- **Trial and Error**: Don’t be afraid to mess up. I launched a project that completely flopped but taught me invaluable lessons. Remember, every mistake is just a step towards success!

### Some good laughs to keep in mind:
Ever tried explaining what you do to your grandma? 😂 “So, you make robots that… write poems? And they can also sell lemonade?” Yeah, something like that, Grandma!

It's easy to think your hobby is just for fun, but why not make it a little more practical? **What if your next AI project didn’t just give you a rush of excitement, but also helped you pay for that fancy coffee habit?**

I bet there are tons of you out there with stories, tips, or even questions about diving into the world of monetizing AI. **How are you using your AI skills for extra income, or have you considered it yet?** Let’s keep this conversation going and maybe we’ll all find that spark to ignite our side hustles! 🚀",1,1754165782.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

I go out hiking almost every weekend that I'm not working, I enjoy my coffee every morning, I travel all over the place. I go to concerts and swimming and play sports and socialize. I'm always pushing myself because if I don't I feel like I'm failing, but I feel like I'm failing when I succeed, too. I run in marathons, I compete in tournaments. I've made it to the top of some of the biggest mountains in my country. It's just never enough. I hate the rhetoric that once you start exercising, socializing, and spend a lot of time outdoors you'll just magically feel better. I've done all of them my whole life and nothing has changed. 

I reach the goal and I don't feel happy. I don't feel good or successful. It's just empty. I've taken up every sport I could, I learned to play instruments, I read all the classics. I read the news and I have fun hobbies. I feel pressured to always be interesting because that's the persona I've made for myself and if I'm not interesting, then I'm nobody. 

My mom sent me to a psychiatrist and counselor for years but it didn't do anything for me. This feeling has been there as long as I can remember. And sure, I love hiking. I love the views and nature.
