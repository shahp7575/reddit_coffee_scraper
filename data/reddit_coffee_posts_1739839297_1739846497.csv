I want to share a drink that could transform your mornings, especially if you’re managing diabetes or striving for a flatter stomach. This powerful, natural detox drink consists of simple ingredients: **apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, and water**. When consumed on an empty stomach, it can kickstart your metabolism, stabilize blood sugar levels, and aid in weight management. Let’s dive into the details of how it works, its benefits, and how you can incorporate it into your daily routine.

**1. Morning Rituals for a Healthier Start**

Starting your day with warm water, coffee, or tea can stimulate digestion and prepare your body for the day ahead. This preps your nervous system and digestive enzymes for optimal functionality, setting the stage for the apple cider vinegar and lemon juice drink to work even better.

**2. How Apple Cider Vinegar Works for Diabetes**

Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is a powerhouse ingredient that has been used for centuries. Its acetic acid content:

* **Improves Insulin Sensitivity**: Helps your body use insulin more effectively, reducing blood sugar spikes.
* **Regulates Blood Sugar**: Consuming diluted ACV before meals can lower post-meal glucose levels.
* **Speeds Up Metabolism**: Promotes fat breakdown and enhances calorie burning.
* **Suppresses Appetite**: Keeps you feeling full longer, reducing unnecessary snacking.

**3. Lemon Juice’s Role in Detox and Immunity**

Lemon juice is another vital ingredient packed with vitamin C, antioxidants, and enzymes. Its benefits include:

* **Cleanses the Blood and GI Tract**: Lemon juice acts as a gentle diuretic, helping flush out toxins.
* **Supports Digestion**: Encourages stomach acid production, aiding in better nutrient absorption.
* **Boosts Immunity**: Vitamin C strengthens your body’s defenses against illnesses.
* **Alleviates Bloating**: Reduces water retention and promotes a flatter stomach.

**4. The Recipe**

Here’s how you can prepare this diabetes-friendly detox drink:

1.     Place a few fresh mint leaves in a pitcher and crush them lightly to release their aroma.

2.     Add 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar.

3.     Squeeze the juice of half a lemon into the mix.

4.     Add 1 cup of water (warm or cold, depending on your preference).

5.     (Optional) Add a natural sweetener like stevia or monk fruit for taste.

6.     Stir well and enjoy!

**5. Customizing the Drink**

If you’d like to enhance the flavor, consider adding:

* **Lemongrass**: Adds a fresh, citrusy aroma.
* **Cinnamon**: Regulates blood sugar and adds a sweet-spicy flavor.
* **Pepper**: Improves nutrient absorption.
* **Cucumber Slices**: Adds a refreshing twist.

**6. The Science Behind Apple Cider Vinegar**

Apple cider vinegar is made by fermenting apple sugars into alcohol and then converting it into acetic acid. Acetic acid has been studied for its:

* **Anti-diabetic properties**: Helps lower fasting blood sugar levels.
* **Anti-cholesterol effects**: Reduces LDL (bad cholesterol) and triglycerides over time.
* **Antioxidant features**: Protects cells from oxidative stress and damage.

**7. Why Lemon Juice Complements Apple Cider Vinegar**

Lemon juice doubles the vitamin C content and adds to the drink’s overall benefits. It also contributes to:

* **Improved Skin Health**: Collagen production is boosted, keeping your skin youthful.
* **Reduced Aging Effects**: Antioxidants fight free radicals that cause premature aging.
* **Weight Loss**: Lemons can curb appetite and promote fat breakdown.

**8. Precautions for Safe Consumption**

While this drink offers numerous benefits, it’s essential to consume it correctly:

* Always dilute apple cider vinegar with water to prevent tooth enamel erosion.
* Limit the drink to once a day to avoid overconsumption of acidic ingredients.
* If you dislike the taste, consider using **apple cider vinegar gummies** as an alternative.

**9. Supports Weight Loss Goals**

Apple cider vinegar is not a magic potion for weight loss, but it can assist when combined with:

* **Intermittent Fasting**: Enhances fat-burning during fasting periods.
* **Daily Exercise**: Amplifies metabolism and calorie burning.
* **Low-Carb Diet**: Stabilizes blood sugar levels and reduces cravings.

**10. Improves Heart Health**

Consuming apple cider vinegar regularly has been linked to lower cholesterol and improved cardiovascular health, reducing risks associated with diabetes, such as hypertension and heart disease.

**11. Anti-Inflammatory Effects**

Both apple cider vinegar and lemon juice help reduce inflammation in the body, which is crucial for preventing diabetes-related complications.

**12. Easy to Incorporate**

This drink is not only easy to prepare but also versatile. You can have it as a standalone morning drink or pair it with a light breakfast for a balanced start to your day.

**13. Alternative Ingredients**

If you’re not a fan of lemons, lime juice works just as well. Lime has a similar nutrient profile and provides the same benefits, with a slightly more tangy flavor.

**14. Hydration Boost**

Adding this drink to your routine encourages better hydration. Staying hydrated is critical for managing diabetes and overall health.

**15. Regular Usage Yields Better Results**

Consistency is key. Drinking this detox juice daily is more effective than sporadic consumption. Even small amounts of ACV and lemon juice can lead to noticeable improvements over time.

**16. A Word of Caution**

Overconsumption of apple cider vinegar can lead to:

* Enamel erosion.
* Reduced potassium levels.
* Digestive discomfort. Moderation is crucial to enjoy the benefits without adverse effects.

**17. Perfect for a Morning Detox**

The combination of apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, and water cleanses your system, helping you feel lighter and more energetic throughout the day.

**18. Cost-Effective Solution**

This drink is affordable, making it an excellent addition to your daily health regimen without breaking the bank.

**19. Boosts Mental Clarity**

Starting your day with a detox drink like this may enhance mental focus and clarity by reducing inflammation and improving gut health.

**20. Simple Yet Powerful**

Though it’s easy to make, the benefits of this drink are significant. From managing blood sugar to promoting weight loss, it’s a natural remedy worth trying.

Incorporating this juice into your morning routine can be a game-changer for diabetics and anyone looking to enhance their health. Try it for ten days, and let the results speak for themselves!

My painter highly recommended SW Duration Flat and told me that SW Duration Flat has a higher sheen that a regular Flat and was supposed to be similar to a true Matte in durability and sheen.

I've slightly rubbed a monitor cable down the wall when connecting to my PC and it created scuff marks all along the side of the wall. Not a golf club, or mallet, or anything ridiculous.. A monitor cable...

The coverage was also horrible, it took the painter like 1 coat of primer + 4 coats of SW Duration to cover over the previous colour. They were painting a lighter colour (swiss coffee) over a dark blue wall, but I feel like it shouldn't take effectively 5 coats of paint and primer.

I also don't know why people say that Duration Flat = Almost Matte, and Duration Matte = Almost Eggshell. Sherwin says that the Gloss/Sheen of Flat is 3 and Matte is 6 (60/85) which is nowhere near the Gloss/Sheen of a regular Matte or Eggshell respectively.",1,1739846138.0,paint,1,1.0,False

I tried giving her expressed milk in a bottle hoping she would calm but it's not always the case 🥲 I find myself getting anxious and rushing back home as soon as she starts crying.

Should I wait a little longer until she's a bit older to take her outside or are there any tips?

I just saw a post of someone being like ""what do I say when someone calls me skinny"" and several of the comments are things like ""just tell them 'yea and you're so fat' 😈"" hmm wonder why you'd suggest that? It's almost like u are admitting that you KNOW fat shaming stings worse and is an actual genuine insult, even in the conversation where you're pretending that skinny shaming is somehow equal. If someone called me skinny, I'd be saying thank u lmfao. When I was a kid I was underweight and I was skinny shamed for years. I'd much rather go back to that. I developed an eating disorder just trying desperately to go back to that and to get that high once again from the attention people gave me for my thinness because it was always either overly positive, jealousy, or concern for my well-being. Those are all good things. Yea maybe if you're deeply anorexic and never wanna recover then you're annoyed by people's concern for you, but it is not a negative insult that they called u skinny. Being ""fat"" is a whole different ballgame, especially for women. Dude any woman over like BMI 20 gets considered fat in America I think, unless their fat is veeeery conveniently stored in the right places. The moment I reached a healthy bmi, my life took a dark turn. Slowly I went from people being amazed whenever I ate a pizza and begging me to eat more, to people suggesting I put the pizza down and recommending me intermittent fasting and keto diets. Did I mention the part where I've dealt w eating disorders? Yea. Not much more needs to be said. Fat shaming is used to control people and make them smaller yes physically but mentally. It's a tactic to destroy a person's confidence and a covert way of basically telling them they should d1e tbh because restrictive ed's are very very deadly. So can we stop the lies pls?? There's not a single magically naturally skinny person who can never gain weight btw. They're always eating in deficit or at maintenance and not making a true effort to fatten up because subconsciously, people don't wanna be fat. It's so fucking easy to go no exercise and eat high caloric food in surplus like crumbl cookies and fries ect ect and I promise these magically skinny people plaguedddd by genetics would suddenly see a change and be fat like they lie and pretend to dream of lmfao. If gaining weight was genuinely so difficult, then there wouldn't be an obesity epidemic. People aren't fat because they purposefully scarf down billions of calories at will. It's because they're not active enough and are eating in a surplus, even a mild surplus, consistently. Which is so easy to do in America especially like some coffees at Starbucks have like 800 calories in just the coffee. So no I will never ever believe that someone is just gifted by the lord and skinny is their natural body type and they're trying sooo hard to gain. They ain't.",0,1739845970.0,Vent,1,0.5,False
1is257i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1is257i/the_body_in_the_rig/,The Body in the Rig,"

If you’re reading this, I need you to believe me. I know how it’s going to sound—crazy, impossible—but I swear on everything I have left that it’s real. Something is out here on the road with me. It’s watching me, stalking me, and I don’t know how much longer I can keep running from it.

I’m writing this because I need someone—anyone—to understand what’s happening. Maybe you’ll think I’ve lost my mind. Maybe you’ll think this is just some trucker’s tall tale, spun out of too many sleepless nights and too much coffee. But if you’ve ever felt like something was watching you from the dark, like there was a shadow just out of sight that didn’t belong there… then maybe you’ll believe me.

My name is Jack Turner. I’ve been driving rigs for almost ten years now, ever since my divorce. Long-haul trucking seemed like a good way to get away from everything—my ex-wife, the house we used to share, the memories I couldn’t stand to look at anymore. Out here on the road, it’s just me and the hum of the engine. No one to answer to, no one to disappoint.

At least, that’s how it used to be.

Lately, though… something’s changed. It started a couple of weeks ago—small things at first. Feeling like someone was watching me when I stopped at rest areas late at night. Seeing shadows move in my mirrors when there shouldn’t have been anything there. Hearing whispers on my CB radio that cut out as soon as I tried to respond.

I told myself it was just fatigue—too many hours behind the wheel, too little sleep—but deep down, I knew better. Something wasn’t right.

And then… then I found him.


It was a little past 2 a.m., somewhere on Highway 287 between Amarillo and the middle of nowhere. The road was dead quiet except for my truck rumbling along in the dark. That stretch of highway always gave me the creeps—too empty, too still—but tonight it felt worse than usual. Like the darkness itself was pressing in around me.

That’s when I saw it: a big rig pulled off to the side of the road up ahead, its hazard lights blinking weakly in the distance like they were struggling to stay alive.

Normally, I’d just keep driving. Truckers break down all the time—it’s part of the job—and most of us know better than to stop for strangers in the middle of nowhere. But something about this rig made me slow down.

Maybe it was the way it was parked—crooked and half-jammed into the shoulder like whoever was driving had barely managed to pull over before stopping. Maybe it was curiosity or guilt—I’d been helped out plenty of times myself when my truck broke down—but whatever it was, I found myself easing onto the shoulder and killing my engine.

The air outside was cold and sharp, with that faint metallic tang you get before a storm rolls in. My boots crunched on gravel as I approached the rig, its hazard lights casting everything in an eerie orange glow.

""Hey!"" I called out, my voice sounding too loud in the stillness. ""You alright in there?""

No answer.

I climbed up onto the step and knocked on the driver’s side door. The window was cracked open just enough for me to hear… something. A faint whispering sound, like static or wind rushing through a tunnel.

""Hello?"" I tried again, leaning closer to peer inside.

That’s when I saw him.

The driver was slumped forward against the steering wheel, his head tilted at an awkward angle like he’d fallen asleep—or worse. His face was hidden by shadows, but even from here I could tell something wasn’t right.

""Shit,"" I muttered under my breath. ""Hey! You okay?""

Still nothing.

I hesitated for a moment before pulling open the door. The whispering sound grew louder as it swung wide—like a radio stuck between stations—but there wasn’t any music playing inside. Just silence… and him.

The smell hit me first: sour and metallic, with an undercurrent of something sweet that made my stomach churn. The kind of smell you don’t forget once you’ve smelled it—the smell of death.

The driver didn’t move as I climbed into the cab, my boots sticking slightly to something on the floor that glistened faintly in the dim light. Blood? No… it was blacker than blood, thicker too, like oil or tar.

""Jesus,"" I whispered, reaching out to shake his shoulder gently. His skin was cold—ice cold—and stiff under my hand.

That’s when his head lolled back.

I stumbled backward with a yelp, nearly tripping over myself as his face came into view. His eyes were wide open but completely black—no whites, no pupils, just endless voids staring back at me. His mouth hung open too, frozen mid-scream as if he’d died in absolute terror.

But it wasn’t just his eyes or his expression that sent chills racing down my spine—it was what had happened to his skin. It looked… wrong. Cracked and splintered like old asphalt baking under a summer sun, with faint veins of glowing orange running through it like molten lava.

And then there were the symbols.

They were carved into his arms and chest—dozens of them—glowing faintly with that same orange light as his veins. Spirals, jagged lines, shapes that didn’t make any sense no matter how long I stared at them. They looked alive somehow—shifting slightly when I blinked as if they were trying to rearrange themselves into something legible.

""What… what is this?"" My voice came out shaky as I backed away toward the door.

That’s when I noticed it: his logbook sitting open on the dashboard next to an old pen with dried black ink crusted on its tip. The pages were covered in writing—not neat rows of numbers or notes but frantic scrawls that spiraled across every inch of paper like a madman had taken over his hand.

And then one line caught my eye:

""It sees me.""

The words were scratched deep into the paper over and over again until they tore through to the next page beneath them.

A low hum filled my ears as I stared at those words—a sound that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere all at once. My vision blurred for a moment as if something was pressing down on me, suffocating me without touching me.

I stumbled out of the cab gasping for air and nearly fell onto my knees beside my truck. The whispering sound followed me outside now—louder than before—as if whatever had been inside that cab wasn’t content staying there anymore.

I didn’t look back as I scrambled into my own rig and slammed the door shut behind me. My hands shook as I fumbled with the keys until finally—the engine roared to life.

The whispering stopped immediately.

For one brief moment, everything felt normal again—the hum of my engine drowning out whatever nightmare had just unfolded behind me.

But then… then my radio crackled to life.

At first, it was just static—a soft hiss that sent chills crawling up my spine—but then came a voice: low and distorted but unmistakably human.

""You shouldn’t have stopped.""

If you’ve made it this far, I’m guessing you’re either curious or crazy enough to keep reading. Either way, I need you to understand something: I didn’t ask for this. I didn’t ask to be dragged into whatever nightmare I’ve stumbled into. All I did was stop to check on a guy who looked like he needed help. That’s it. And now… now my life is unraveling faster than I can hold it together.

After I found that trucker—after I saw his face, those symbols carved into his ski n—I thought I could just drive away and forget about it. Pretend it never happened. But you can’t unsee something like that. You can’t unfeel the way the air around him felt heavy, like it was alive and pressing down on me. And you sure as hell can’t ignore the whispers that followed me out of that rig.

I tried, though. God knows I tried.

For the first few hours after I left, I convinced myself it was just shock messing with my head. That maybe the guy had some kind of rare disease or… or maybe he’d been part of some weird cult. People do crazy shit out here on the road—you hear stories all the time. But deep down, I knew it wasn’t that simple.

The whispers didn’t stop.

At first, they were faint—just a soft hiss at the edge of my hearing, like static on a bad radio signal. But as the miles rolled by, they got louder. Clearer. They weren’t just noise anymore—they were voices. Dozens of them, overlapping and murmuring things I couldn’t quite make out. And sometimes… sometimes they said my name.

I turned off my CB radio, thinking maybe it was picking up interference from somewhere, but it didn’t help. The voices weren’t coming from the radio—they were coming from *everywhere.* From the hum of my engine, from the wind rushing past my windows, from inside my own goddamn head.

And then there were the shadows.

I started seeing them in my mirrors not long after I crossed into New Mexico—a flicker of movement here, a dark shape darting across the road there. At first, I thought it was just my eyes playing tricks on me—too many hours behind the wheel—but then one of them got close enough for me to see it clearly.

It wasn’t human.

I don’t even know how to describe it properly—it was like a smear of darkness that didn’t belong in this world. Its edges were wrong somehow, like they were fraying or dissolving into nothingness. And its eyes… God, its eyes were just empty holes that seemed to suck in all the light around them.

It didn’t do anything—just stood there at the edge of the road watching me as I drove past—but its presence left me shaking so badly I had to pull over for a minute to catch my breath.

That’s when I realized this wasn’t going away.


The next few days were a blur of sleepless nights and mounting paranoia. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that trucker’s face—or worse, those shifting symbols carved into his skin. Every time I tried to eat or drink something, it tasted wrong—like ash or metal. And every time I thought about calling someone for help—a friend, a doctor—I stopped myself because… what would I even say?

""Hi, yeah, so there’s this thing following me and whispering in my ear all night long? Oh, and by the way, I think it might be turning me insane?""

Yeah. That’d go over well.

But then came last night—the night everything changed.


It happened at another lonely stretch of highway just outside Albuquerque. The whispers had been getting louder all evening—so loud that I could barely hear myself think—and the shadows had started appearing more frequently too. They weren’t just hanging back at the edges anymore—they were keeping pace with my truck now, flitting alongside me like predators circling their prey.

And then… then my headlights went out.

One second they were illuminating the road ahead like normal; the next they flickered and died completely, plunging me into total darkness. My heart jumped into my throat as panic set in—I slammed on the brakes and fumbled for my flashlight in the glove box—but before I could even turn it on… he appeared.

At first, he was just a silhouette standing in front of my truck—a tall figure cloaked in shadow with no discernible features except for two faintly glowing eyes that seemed to pierce right through me. But as he stepped closer into what little light remained from my dashboard display… his form began to shift.

The air around me felt heavier with each passing second, like it was pressing down on my chest. My flashlight trembled in my hand, its weak beam barely cutting through the oppressive darkness. The thing—*he*—stood there, shifting and writhing like a living oil slick, his glowing eyes boring into me.

Then his voice......

""Jack Turner,"" he said again, his voice a symphony of whispers and echoes. ""You’ve been busy."" 

I swallowed hard. My throat felt dry as sandpaper. ""What… what do you want?"" I managed to croak out.

He tilted his head, the movement almost birdlike, as if he were studying me from some strange angle I couldn’t comprehend. Then he let out a low laugh—a sound like gravel rolling down a metal chute. ""Oh, Jack,"" he said, his tone dripping with mock pity. ""Sweet, simple Jack. Always so quick to ask the wrong questions.""

I froze, unsure how to respond. My instincts screamed at me to run, but my legs wouldn’t move. It was like they were rooted to the ground—or maybe I was just too terrified to try.

""You’re adorable when you’re scared,"" he continued with a grin that spread across one of his many faces—a grin that didn’t belong on anything remotely human. ""All wide-eyed and trembling like a kid caught sneaking cookies before dinner."" He leaned in closer, his shifting form looming over me like a storm cloud. ""But let’s be honest—you’ve got bigger problems than crumbs on your shirt.""

""What… what are you?"" I stammered.

His grin widened impossibly, stretching across several faces at once until it looked like his entire body was smirking at me. ""Oh, come on now,"" he said with mock exasperation, throwing up one of his many hands—or what passed for a hand in that moment. ""You’ve already figured that out, haven’t you? Or did all those little whispers and shadows go right over your head?""

I opened my mouth to respond, but no words came out. He didn’t wait for me to try again.

""I’m *that thing,* Jack,"" he said with a dramatic flourish, gesturing toward himself as if presenting an award-winning performance. ""The bump in the night. The shadow in the corner of your eye that you pretend isn’t there."" His voice dropped lower, colder. ""*The part of you that knows better but ignores it anyway.*""

He straightened up again, his form shifting into something taller and more imposing as he loomed over me like a nightmare given flesh. ""But if you’re looking for something more poetic,"" he added with a sly grin, ""you can call me… an artist.""

""An artist?"" I echoed dumbly.

""That’s right!"" he said brightly, clapping his hands together in mock enthusiasm. The sound echoed unnaturally in the stillness around us. ""And guess what? You’re my next masterpiece!""

My stomach dropped like I’d just driven off a cliff. ""What do you mean?"" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

""Oh, don’t play dumb now,"" he said with a roll of one of his many eyes—or maybe all of them at once; it was hard to tell when they kept shifting around his body like fireflies trapped in tar. ""You’ve been feeling it already, haven’t you? The whispers? The shadows? That little itch at the back of your mind telling you something’s *wrong?*"" He leaned in closer again until I could feel the cold radiating off him like an open grave. ""That’s just the warm-up act.""

I tried to step back, but my legs still wouldn’t move. ""Why me?"" I asked desperately.

""Why not?"" he shot back instantly with a shrug that rippled through his entire form like liquid mercury. ""You stopped when no one else would. You *looked.* And now…"" He paused for dramatic effect before leaning in even closer until his face—or one of them—was inches from mine. ""*Now you’re interesting.*""

I shuddered as his words sank in, but he wasn’t finished yet.

""Oh, don’t look so glum!"" he said cheerfully, slapping me on the shoulder with a hand that felt far too solid for something so… wrong. ""Most people go their whole lives without ever being noticed by something as important as me."" He stepped back slightly and spread his arms wide as if addressing an invisible audience. ""*Congratulations,* Jack! You’ve officially graduated from boring little nobody to star of your very own horror story!""

His laughter filled the air around us—loud and echoing and utterly devoid of warmth—and I felt my stomach twist into knots.

""But don’t worry,"" he added after a moment, his tone softening into something almost comforting—but not quite. ""I’m not going to kill you… yet."" He tapped one long finger against what might have been his chin if it weren’t constantly dissolving into shadow and reforming again elsewhere on his body. ""No no no… That would be too easy.""

He leaned in one last time until I could feel his cold breath on my face—if whatever came out of him could even be called breath—and whispered: ""*I’m going to make you special.*""

And then he was gone.

One moment he was standing there in front of me; the next he dissolved into smoke and shadows that melted into the darkness around us like they’d never been there at all.

For a long time after that, I just stood there staring at the empty road ahead of me, my flashlight still clutched uselessly in my hand.

Special.

The word echoed in my mind over and over again until it didn’t sound like a word anymore—just some alien concept that didn’t belong in this world or any other.

Whatever this thing was… whatever it wanted… I knew one thing for sure:

I wasn’t going to survive it.

What the hell is happening?

I know that you people know about this kind of thing that's why I'm here. Does anyone have any idea what the hell that thing is and what it's talking about?

1is23a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/fican/comments/1is23a2/just_hit_spouse_fi_about_to_implement_the_plan/,Just hit Spouse FI - about to implement the plan!!,"Hey folks,

After a long journey since around 2014-15, I have pulled the trigger on becoming FI. I’m 44 and my partner is 42 -we both live in a big metro in Alberta. I gave my supervisor my notice last week. I believe my last day of work will be on March 28th…Still working out the details on the last day and my transition plan.

The journey here: I moved to Alberta at the end of 2012 for my first professional job. about a year later I met my partner, who immigrated from South America to be with me. We discovered FI  around 2014/15 and have been working towards the school ever since. I've worked in a management role since I arrived and have worked my way up to a senior leadership role, which I just  stepped down from. so I've had the luck of having a high paying job throughout this time.  My partner, as a community of immigrant, struggled at first but has definitely found her stride and has moved into a managerial role herself.

My partner, given how hard she has worked to move up the corporate ladder as an immigrant to Canada, doesn't want to stop working yet. She wants to work a couple more years and build up her DB pension a bit more. This means I'm becoming spouse-FI.

Here is a breakdown on my assets/portfolio:



||
||
|TFSA|199,404|
|RRSP|139,841|
|FHSA|9,979|
|Non-Reg|847,851|
|Non-reg 2|7,214|
|**Total**|**1,204,289**|



ETF breakdown 



VXC - 37%

XEQT - 19%

HEQT - 15%

VDY - 15%

XDG - 7%

ZPR - 4%

USCC - 3%

I also own a 2-bedroom worth around $200,00, which is currently rented out. I own another condo outside of Canada (in a beautiful tropical location!!) worth around $130,000, also rented out. Both properties fully paid off. The former, after deductions, produces around $900/month and the latter around $650/month. Note: all assets are in CAD.

I have a DB pension that will pay me $3,600/month when I turn 65 for the rest of my life. CPP will pay me around $580/month and I would expect to receive around the max OAS of around $615 (give or take). All these are indexed to inflation, though my DB pension isn’t fully indexed (only 60% of Canada CPI). My partner also has a DB pension - we estimated that it will produce her with around $1,300/month at age 65 if she were to resign today, but as mentioned above, she wants to work a few more years to bump this up.  She will likely receive half of the OAS amount because she immigrated to Canada mid-career and we expect her to receive a similar CPP amount to mine. Her investment portfolio is above $500k with a similar breakdown to mine.

My portfolio produces around $2,100/month in dividends. My two properties produce around 1,200-1,300/month, totally a total of around $3,300-3,400/month. This will be my monthly income. My partner will be taking care of the rent, utilities and internet costs moving forward. I will be responsible for groceries and home insurance. I believe this will amount to around $550-650/month, leaving $2650 for the remainder of the month for things like my gym membership, going out for coffee and int’l travel. We are pretty frugal and don’t need the luxury lifestyle. Once my partner resigns, we will likely move to a lower cost country where we will spend $2,500-3,000 to live a very comfortable lifestyle. We both speak additional languages fluently (Spanish, Portuguese and English)...

The current portfolio setup strives to strike a balance between global growth ETFs and dividend/income funds to help fund a modest lifestyle during my first few years of FI. I don’t plan on selling any units and just living off the dividend/income I mentioned above. I have a small covered call ETF position that helps create higher income and I’m fine with losing a bit of the upside to receive some of this income in the early days of FI.

In terms of what is next, I will likely do some international slow travel to celebrate and decompress from a very stressful career. I plan on starting a small business, one with a partner and the other more of a side hustle project with little to no startup costs. This will provide me with the purpose I need but help me set my own work schedule and strive for a balance with health and other personal and social goals.

So that is the plan! I’m excited to finish up my last day at work so that I can truly detach from the grind and slow life down a few notches while I decompress and re-energize for what comes next.

I would love to hear from others who have recently hit FI and have transitioned into their new lives. What have they learned? What surprised them? How has their overall health improved etc.? Let’s keep the conversation going!:)

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1is21av,https://www.reddit.com/r/Telomina_gaming/comments/1is21av/a_swedish_city_library_for_your_sims/,A Swedish City Library for your Sims #TheSimsCreatorProgram,"Hello everyone!  
^(find the build in the Sims 4 gallery searching for #telomina) 

So, as some might know already. I am not in the EA creator program thanks to my Sims build. I do however occasionally like to build something I feel is missing in my game, and then I have inspiration from somewhere. This time, it is a Swedish city library, called ""The Garage Library"". This is a library I used to visit but don't anymore since there was some serious disturbances. So if the library seems chaotic to you when playing (with pretty bad folk music, or a surprisingly chillaxing jazz), then I have captured its essence. 

I hope you enjoy the lot if you download it!  


[outside from the street view](https://preview.redd.it/gw1slcgo3tje1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f23c80d263a45227ec38a1b40870e41ab775a9e)

I decided to place this library in Ravenwood, since there was a good sized lot that fit the purpose. I am not super detailed-oriented in my builds, so feel free to improve on the landscaping outside (there are images on google of the place). 

[the play area](https://preview.redd.it/drys92ed4tje1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=364f8ddae9a5a0bc3c521c2633fc3f6db836b784)

The interior is open and spacious, but the shelves are placed in a way that you can still get a sense of privacy, if you manage to get a free spot. Since this is a convivial lot that encourages groups of people to come together it's not a ""quiet place"", and it has a designated area for kids.   


[Bottom floor pc stations \(yes they work on bar counters, unfortunately they are on those irl too\)](https://preview.redd.it/pz8qlbcs5tje1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=670fdf6546f14aa55d1ad4a54216b062cea7e038)

There are several computers, some in open spaces for quick business, if anyone needs a quick google search or contact the authorities, or print paper (irl that is). But upstairs you find a more quiet spot for intense studies.

[the quiet study spot has 4 desks, 2 with laptops](https://preview.redd.it/beks7y5m4tje1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=e50f5653fe997fe2bb7e9a2638c93d41793628cb)

  
The library even has a coffee shop, feel free to order yourself something nice, perhaps a cake to that? You can sit at any seat besides the computer seats while you eat & drink.

[a coffee station, not sure how to make the baristas stay tho](https://preview.redd.it/vco6n1gx4tje1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=877e3de2857cb232a0df20c1f9bf7ee8822812ac)

Adding some vending machines to replace the borrow-and -return and staff desk that you can find in the real library. 

Did someone say... a stage? Yes, this library even have special events some evenings! The regular library business might have closed then if you need a ticket for the event. 

[Eclectic selection of chairs, and a stage, aaaand a screen](https://preview.redd.it/ss4o8x516tje1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=72717aba037c6a9b93201c786133d1b998a67f87)

At the upstairs you can enjoy some hobbies, or... spy-equipment as well. As the library also have a skill & hobby section. At this library irl you can even borrow home tools like electric drills, or a full tool box!

In the Sims library there is also 2 sets of chess boards, mainly because this was a requirement in Sims for a library.

I don't have many people in my life period and the ones I do have I can't talk to about this. This is going to be long and I apologize for that in advance but I want to be as clear and open as possible in hopes someone can give me some advice. Or even just a different perspective than my weird brain can as I tend to overanalyze everything. And it bounces back and forth at random because my thoughts are all over so apologies for that as well. 

I met this guy awhile back. He isn't just any guy. He is the most beautiful man I've ever met. In every way. He completes me in almost every way possible and so often it seems that we are the same person. He is a mirror image to me in terms of likes, dislikes, values, desires, just about everything. But he is beautiful. His soul is so beautiful to me. And he is so absolutely handsome to me. I don't even want to look at anyone else. I've been in relationships and I've dated. Have not had the best track record in that department. I always get hurt in some way. And I leave. I've been through enough that I don't stay for any crap anymore. It took a long time to heal from past issues and I was doing so well for the past few years. I did not really want a relationship and have been clear about this to everyone else in my life.Ive always been better off alone.

 Anyways I posted something on Reddit, which is how I met (online) and connected with the guy. I was pulled to him like a magnet. He was literally smack dab in the middle of like 60 messages. I didn't talk to the ones before or after him but for some reason, I actually opened his full message and talked to him. We were both so enamored and were compatible on a crazy level. We eventually shifted to texting. The energy was so beautiful and amazing. We were beautiful together. And he was all I wanted. We were all each other wanted. We talked for a while before deciding to meet in the real world. He told me he had lots of free time and could come to me since we live like 45-55 minutes away. We both like driving so it wasn't a big deal. We ended up meeting half way, like 30 minutes for us both. We met and grew closer. After a bit of time I asked if I could get a hotel on his days off so we could be together and have our first sleepover. He was so excited and so we did. It was two days of euphoric bliss. We did everything together, kept physical contact of some sort the entire time and it was beautiful. 

Before leaving, I asked where his family, in particular his grandmother who he helps care for, thought he was and he said he didn't have to explain anything to anyone. Then said she knew he was with me. Anyways we moved on with day to day, at some point I was waiting for the next time we would see each other. But things kept happening..his uncle got sick. Then he got sick. Then he was getting better. His next days off he took some family out. I asked about getting together and he said he still had phlegm and didn't want me to get sick. And I keep dropping these hints always waiting. I brought up Valentines Day a few times thinking ok..this is the one day of the year to be here for me, with me. He insisted he would make the plans and to be patient and so I was.

 Then he got roped into working the second night so we were on just for V.Day. I was a little bummed but ok, i can deal with it. The night before he said he was going to come as soon as he could in the morning because he was so excited to see me. I was stoked.

The day of his sister came into town from out of state which I did not realize. I knew there was a family dinner on Sunday but I thought she lived here so it wasn't a big deal. And he kept texting, telling me he was trying to get out of there. For hours. In the end he said he wanted to reschedule and said his sister had planned this is advance. And he hadnt seen her in months. Like I was rude for expecting him to leave and go anywhere. I don't know if he even booked anything. I am thinking he had no intention of seeing me. I was so excited for this day because I knew I would get to see him. No, just hurt again. I mean it's just a bullshit holiday anyways, I guess? If it wasn't, he would have done anything to be together. Not used his family as an excuse.

 All the names before..queen, baby, etc have all been reduced to hun and an occasional honey. He now says I knew he was a family man when we met. He told me that after but I loved it because he talked about building our life together and thought I was a part of that..he spoke of our family we were building. He was always telling me he wanted to protect me and take care of me(not financially, like emotionally) and he would treat me the way I should have always been treated and I would never be hurt again. Now he keeps disappearing on me.

 A few weeks ago I questioned things because most men tell at least someone in their life they have a gf. He didn't, said he was private and didn't have to tell anyone anything, this was his life. He also before has said I was his life, was his everything, ""as it should be"". Anyways me questioning started a little something and he disappeared. I tried texting and calling and nothing for days. I called one night and told him i would be at our halfway spot the next morning and to please meet me so we could talk face to face. He didn't. Didn't reply.

 I called and texted. I was breaking down because I thought it was over and he was ghosting me. I begged him to please come and talk. Finally after waiting at this park for 3 hours he text and said he wasn't coming and I was making him uncomfortable rushing him to talk? And got defensive over the ghosting comment because he ""took time to think about things"". Most people say they need to take a minute so you aren't just wondering what is going on. I asked him to not disappear and he said ""IM NOT DISAPPEARING"". That was the 4th worst day of my life..i ended up having a panic attack and throwing up all over myself and my car, draining my battery and having to wait 3 hours for roadside assistance..i was there 6 hours that day. Complete breakdown. 

And I don't break over men. Ever. I walk away. Or run away. Anyways we somewhat worked things out and went kinda back to normal. Mostly. I still have felt so disconnected from him. I just needed anything. Any time. So many times asking for a halfway meet for an hour getting coffee or anything. Any of the beautiful promises that were made in the beginning. I would take 5 minutes being able to look into his eyes..then I would be able to see and know what is real. And I can't have even that.

 Then the V.Day thing happened. He came back and said the reason I probably feel ""hidden"" is because his grandmother gets jealous and selfish and has ruined his past relationships. That he has a life but not allowed to have time of his own. He basically alluded to that being why I was hidden or whatever. So there may be lies involved, idk. Basically a complete 360 from what he said in the beginning. Idk what is going on. He tells me partial information and it leaves me in a constant confused state. The last I heard was around 7pm on V.Day that his sister was gonna help him figure this out. I asked if it was about his grandma? No reply. And I haven't heard from him since.  

I am so hurt. I just want time with my bf. What happened to him? Everything has changed so much and I don't understand. I have fallen in love with this beautiful man but I would rather just cut me loose if he doesn't feel the same. I don't want him to keep me dangling out of pity, especiallybecauseof my past.

 In a perfect world he would be what he was before. I want him to be the loving bf he was. But I don't know what to do. In all my life I have never felt for another person what I feel for him. And I see him the way he was still and if it is all misunderstandings and he has been just going through alot with his family I don't want to walk away. I wish he would have told me all of it at the beginning, just as I threw all my negative out there for him. Also something I've never in my life done with anyone. I would have been there for him and we would have avoided so much drama. I truly see a life with him. He asked me about forever a few times and I am still on board for that. But only if he still really wants me. I don't want this emotional hurt, it is so foreign to me and I don't know how to process it. I'm not use to feeling any of this.

 I am starting to feel like maybe I am just a game? And I cant do head games. And he doesn't even know I am across the country at this moment because of an emergency. I've really needed him to help me not be alone through something serious. But it seems like the universe makes it happen like this and I have to struggle alone, like always. He said so many beautiful things and this is one of them..never having to go through life alone. I don't want a text only bf. And there is no ""long distance"". We live less than an hour apart. How does someone go from being willing to drive anywhere at anytime to be with you during all their free time because you are their #1 priority, their ""life"" to…making excuses about long distance relationships and having no time and not being allowed to see me? Why did he even pursue me to begin with? 

And that is why I've begun to think he isn't into me. Or maybe I've got it confused again and he was hopeful the grandma wouldn't be a problem or interfere. Omg I just don't know what to think. Or do. I can't concentrate on anything and cry randomly. And have to lie to my daughter about why I randomly burst into tears because I don't want her to think negatively before she even meets him. 

I would literally give a limb at this moment to be able to sit down and have a face to face conversation about everything and find out where we stand. No matter what he decides. I just can't handle this. But I can't keep chasing him down when he ignores me and disappears. I won't play those games anymore, they push me too far and I can not sink that far down. But I have a feeling if I don't reach out and beg him to talk to me, again just like last time, I will never hear from him again. It makes me feel sick to my stomach. I've tried being patient but he never tells me for what. If he is sincere about what he is dealing with, then he needs to decide if I'm important enough to fight for. Or if he is gonna let her ruin another relationship for him. He goes from at one point freaking out over how he can't lose me to just... idk? He keeps saying opening up about his family would scare me away. It wouldnt. I dont get scared away. But he is starting to lose me. All of this is pushing me to points i cant go to..pushing me away.. not being there…the changes…the different stories…and as much as i already do feel and as much as I want him, I cant stay if this doesnt stop. Even though I am trying so hard..to be patient and hope he is sincere.

 On V.Day I asked him if he was in love. At least that would tell me he does or doesnt want this. He didnt reply. And then I did, disgustingly, tell him via text since that is all I have lately, that I have fallen in love with him. He ignored that too. There is so much I can and want to say to give the full picture. But it is too much. I just want him back. The him that he was. If that was the real him. And if it wasnt the real him, I just wish he would be honest. My head is so twisted and confused I dont know what to think about anything. 

And if you do offer insight or advice, please..be respectful towards him. Regardless of how things have unfolded between us, I truly have love for this man and do not want anyone bashing him. I'm not perfect and have made mistakes, especially trying to push him away. Just please be respectful!   

 Missing any angles or being ghosted now that we are going on 4 days? Maybe he is trying to get rid of me nicely? I dont want to walk away but he is pushing me that way. I have never cared so deeply or felt anything even close for someone in a romantic sense. I have always been mildly annoyed at men calling a woman ""queen""..I not only allow him to call me that but I actually really adored it. I adored being his queen, his delicate treasure that he needed to protect and take care of. THAT is how hard I have fallen for him.  

Fuck, I am so lost. I miss him and just want him back..my beautiful, sweet, loving man. Help? Any advice. All advice. Its possible I have gotten things mixed up and there are just alot of misunderstandings.. If so, what then?  I need to make him understand this needs to stop happening and these things are hurtful, we should be working together. Or maybe I am just being a pathetic, sad bitch that needs to just go back to what I am good at. Being alone.

# The Problem with “Dumb” Search

Early in my career, I built a recipe recommendation app that matched keywords like “chicken” to recipes containing “chicken.” It failed spectacularly. Users searching for “quick weeknight meals” didn’t care about keywords — they wanted *context*: meals under 30 minutes, minimal cleanup, kid-friendly. Traditional search couldn’t bridge that gap.

Vector search changes this. Instead of treating data as strings, it maps everything — text, images, user behavior — into **numerical vectors** that capture meaning. For example, “quick weeknight meals,” “30-minute dinners,” and “easy family recipes” cluster closely in vector space, even with zero overlapping keywords. This is how AI starts to “think” like us .

# What This Article Is About

This article is my try to dives into how vector search is revolutionizing AI’s ability to discover patterns, relationships, and insights at unprecedented speed and precision. By moving beyond rigid keyword matching, vector search enables machines to understand context, infer intent, and retrieve results with human-like intuition. Through Python code examples, system design diagrams, and industry use cases (like accelerating drug discovery and personalizing content feeds), we’ll explore how this technology makes AI systems faster, more adaptable.

# So, What Vector Search Really is ?

Imagine you’re in a music store. Instead of searching for songs by title (like “Bohemian Rhapsody”), you hum a tune. The clerk matches your hum to songs with similar *melodic patterns*, even if they’re in different genres. Vector search works the same way: it finds data based on *semantic patterns*, not exact keywords.

Vector search maps data (text, images, etc.) into high-dimensional numerical vectors. Similarity is measured using distance metrics (e.g., cosine similarity).

# Use below code to understand vector space in a very simpler way

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
    import numpy as np  
    
    # Mock embeddings: [sweetness, crunchiness]  
    fruits = {  
        ""Apple"": [0.9, 0.8],  
        ""Banana"": [0.95, 0.2],  
        ""Carrot"": [0.3, 0.95],  
        ""Grapes"": [0.85, 0.1]  
    }  
    
    # Plotting  
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))  
    for fruit, vec in fruits.items():  
        plt.scatter(vec[0], vec[1], label=fruit)  
    plt.xlabel(""Sweetness →""), plt.ylabel(""Crunchiness →"")  
    plt.title(""Fruit Vector Space"")  
    plt.legend()  
    plt.grid(True)  
    plt.show()  

Banana and Grapes cluster near high sweetness, while Carrot stands out with crunchiness.

# Can We Implement Vector Search Ourselves?

**Yes!** Let’s build a minimal vector search engine using pure Python:

    import numpy as np  
    from collections import defaultdict  
    
    class VectorSearch:  
        def __init__(self):  
            self.index = defaultdict(list)  
    
        def add_vector(self, id: int, vector: list):  
            self.index[id] = np.array(vector)  
    
        def search(self, query_vec: list, k=3):  
            query = np.array(query_vec)  
            distances = {}  
            for id, vec in self.index.items():  
                # Euclidean distance  
                distances[id] = np.linalg.norm(vec - query)  
            # Return top K closest  
            return sorted(distances.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])[:k]  
    
    # Example usage  
    engine = VectorSearch()  
    engine.add_vector(1, [0.9, 0.8])  # Apple  
    engine.add_vector(2, [0.95, 0.2])  # Banana  
    engine.add_vector(3, [0.3, 0.95])  # Carrot  
    
    query = [0.88, 0.15]  # Sweet, not crunchy  
    results = engine.search(query, k=2)  
    print(f""Top matches: {results}"")  # Output: [(2, 0.07), (1, 0.15)] → Banana, Apple  

**Key Limitations:**

* Brute-force search (O(n) time) — impractical for large datasets.
* No dimensionality reduction or indexing.

# The Mechanics of Smarter, Faster Discovery

# Step 1: Teaching Machines to “Understand” (Embeddings)

Vector search begins with **embedding models**, which convert data into dense numerical representations. Let’s encode product reviews using Python’s `sentence-transformers`:

    from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
    
    model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
    reviews = [
        ""This blender is loud but crushes ice perfectly."", 
        ""Silent coffee grinder with inconsistent grind size."",
        ""Powerful juicer that’s easy to clean.""
    ]
    embeddings = model.encode(reviews)
    
    print(f""Embedding shape: {embeddings.shape}"")  # (3, 384)

Despite no shared keywords, the first and third reviews (“blender” and “juicer”) will be neighbors in vector space because both emphasize *functionality* over noise levels .

# Step 2: Speed Without Sacrifice (Indexing)

Raw vectors are useless without efficient retrieval. Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms like HNSW balance speed and accuracy. Here’s a FAISS implementation:

    import faiss
    
    dimension = 384
    index = faiss.IndexHNSWFlat(dimension, 32)  # 32=neighbor connections for speed
    index.add(embeddings)
    
    # Find similar products to a query
    query = model.encode([""Compact kitchen appliance for smoothies""])
    distances, indices = index.search(query, k=2)
    print([reviews[i] for i in indices[0]])  # Returns blender and juicer reviews

This code retrieves results in milliseconds, even with billions of vectors — a game-changer for real-time apps like live customer support .

# Step 3: Hybrid Intelligence

Pure vector search can miss exact matches (e.g., SKU codes). Hybrid systems merge vector and keyword techniques. Below is a Mermaid diagram of a real-time product search architecture I designed for an e-commerce client:

Based on my experience, this system boosted conversion rates by 22% by blending semantic understanding with business rules.

# Now, let’s understand Popular Vector Search Algorithms

# a) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Brute-force exact search.

    from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors  
    
    # Mock dataset  
    X = np.array([[0.9, 0.8], [0.95, 0.2], [0.3, 0.95]])  
    knn = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=2, metric='euclidean')  
    knn.fit(X)  
    
    # Query  
    distances, indices = knn.kneighbors([[0.88, 0.15]])  
    print(f""Indices: {indices}, Distances: {distances}"")  # Matches Banana (index 1)  

# b) Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)

Trade accuracy for speed. **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)** example using `hnswlib`:

    import hnswlib  
    
    # Build index  
    dim = 2  
    index = hnswlib.Index(space='l2', dim=dim)  
    index.init_index(max_elements=1000, ef_construction=200, M=16)  
    index.add_items(X)  
    
    # Search  
    labels, distances = index.knn_query([[0.88, 0.15]], k=2)  
    print(f""HNSW matches: {labels}"")  # [1, 0] → Banana, Apple  

# c) IVF (Inverted File Index)

Partitions data into clusters.

    import faiss  
    
    # IVF example  
    quantizer = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dim)  
    index_ivf = faiss.IndexIVFFlat(quantizer, dim, 2)  # 2 clusters  
    index_ivf.train(X)  
    index_ivf.add(X)  
    
    # Search  
    index_ivf.nprobe = 1  # Search 1 cluster  
    D, I = index_ivf.search(np.array([[0.88, 0.15]]).astype('float32'), k=2)  
    print(f""IVF matches: {I}"")  # [1, 0]  

# 4. Advanced Vector Search

# a) Multimodal Search

Combine text and image vectors:

    # Mock CLIP-like embeddings  
    text_embedding = [0.4, 0.6]  
    image_embedding = [0.38, 0.58]  
    
    # Concatenate or average  
    multimodal_vec = np.concatenate([text_embedding, image_embedding])  
    
    # Search across both modalities  
    class MultimodalIndex:  
        def __init__(self):  
            self.texts = []  
            self.images = []  
    
        def add(self, text_vec, image_vec):  
            self.texts.append(text_vec)  
            self.images.append(image_vec)  
    
        def search(self, query_vec, alpha=0.5):  
            # Weighted sum  
            scores = [alpha * np.dot(query_vec, t) + (1-alpha) * np.dot(query_vec, i)  
                      for t, i in zip(self.texts, self.images)]  
            return sorted(enumerate(scores), key=lambda x: -x[1])  

# b) Hybrid Search

Combine vector + keyword search using reciprocal rank fusion:

    def hybrid_search(vector_results, keyword_results, weight=0.7):  
        combined = {}  
        for rank, (id, _) in enumerate(vector_results):  
            combined[id] = combined.get(id, 0) + (1 - rank/10) * weight  
        for rank, (id, _) in enumerate(keyword_results):  
            combined[id] = combined.get(id, 0) + (1 - rank/10) * (1 - weight)  
        return sorted(combined.items(), key=lambda x: -x[1])  
    
    # Example  
    vector_results = [(2, 0.1), (1, 0.2)]  # Banana, Apple  
    keyword_results = [(3, 0.9), (1, 0.8)]  # Carrot, Apple  
    print(hybrid_search(vector_results, keyword_results))  # Apple (1) ranks highest

I'd like to discuss my history and ongoing issues both as a way to vent and to get some advice. Additionally, if anyone else is experiencing/searching this, know you are not alone! (Also, writing this in such a way, so that those searching just like how I was searching, can find it)

[30M]
In early December 2024, I noticed some unusual urinary issues

* Slight burning sensation when peeing (and i do mean slight.)
* Urinary Frequency (I felt like I had to go alot more)
* Little Discharge (looking back this should have been a bigger clue)
* Sensitive penis head

At first, I had thought these were problems with frequent masturbation (I know, stupid) and decided to give it some time to heal. It did not. Two weeks later I ordered an the extended STD test from Quest; positive for chlamydia. I went to Urgent Care, told the Doctor, was prescribed a week of doxy, and took it religiously. This was 3rd week of December.

During the doxy and for about a week after, I was fine. Then the following symptoms have appeared

* Constant sensation of urine stuck in urethra/penis. This feeling occurs right at the head as if there is just a little bit of liquid that needs to come out.
* Frequent urination (but this is really to try to get rid of the one above)
* Feeling of discharge coming from the penis tip. This I attribute to the urine sensation. I have checked underwear but never see any evidence.
* Tingling sensation inside the urethra. Only at the tip and like inside but on the bottom if that makes sense

About a week later, (mid January), I began panicking thinking there was something else wrong, after all I did the treatment. I read on here to test for Mgen and went and ordered that as well. Next day, went back to UrgentCare and told them my recurrent symptoms. Mistakenly told them what I thought (the Mgen) and was prescribed moxi. I took the whole course of antibiotics even though the test came back negative for mgen. Should also add, they did a NAAT for chlamydia and tested negative for chlamydia.

A week after that, I managed to get an appointment with a urologist, who told me that I would have to wait 2-3 months in severe cases to heal, and was sent on my way. (Would 2-4 weeks of symptomatic chlamydia be considered severe?) In the interim, I was prescribed Mirabegron to help with frequent urination. I also took a urine culture which was negative for bacteria (however, I was still on the moxi so that should be taken into account)

It has now officially been 2 months since then. For the last 2 weeks, I have been doing pelvic floor stretches (found a Youtube video and follow along), and tried some mindfulness (I'll be honest, I don't know how to do this, in the quiet I think about the constant ""wet"" feeling)

All to say, my current symptoms have remained. The 4 mentioned above are the only ones. I have no pain whatsoever. (Closest thing I can say to pain, is a testicle ache but only when I sleep on my side) I have begun monitoring my fluid intake (58 floz/1.5 L) and the times I pee (not the amount, don't know how you do that) as well. While I can hold it for 3-4 hours, the tingling and wet sensation drives me crazy, and sometimes I decide to go a bit sooner. In terms of diets, I don't drink alcohol,tea,or coffee and have not been eating spicy food. Habit wise, I have put a pause on masturbation, and going for 20 minute walks every day.

I have an upcoming appointment with a different urologist to get a second opinion and also because this symptom is hell.

My game plan is the following:

* Another full STD Panel. I will specify that I want MGen/MHominis, Ureaplasma (didn't have this test), Yeast exam, Gardnerella (read men can have this here)
* UTI test (rare in men, but you never know)
* Swab test.
* PSA Test (given my age, this might be harder)
* Urine culture (this time i will not be on antibiotics) and Semen Culture
* Prostate check
* Bladder and (Urethra if possible) ultrasounds
* Urodynamics / Cystoscopy? (Could this be a stricture?)

Thank you very much!

Anything else I am missing? I'd like to try and rule out any other issues. If you think it's something else, I'd love to hear what else it could be to bring up with my doctor.

Lastly, I have a question that's driving me crazy. If you ""milk"" your penis, is there supposed to be a clear liquid drop (more like less of a drop) that comes out/becomes visible?

I’d find myself pushing them off until the afternoon—or sometimes even the next day—simply because they felt overwhelming or just plain boring. Then I came across an article on life hacks hub about the “eat the frog” method. In a nutshell, it means you knock out your hardest or most dreaded task first thing in the morning.

For the past two weeks, I've been giving it a shot, and wow, it’s made a huge difference.

The first few days were definitely challenging, but once I finished that big task, I felt an incredible sense of relief and accomplishment. By noon, I was like, “Phew, the worst is over!” and the rest of my day felt so much lighter. Even my evenings are calmer now because I'm not carrying around that nagging worry.

I was so impressed with how much this simple change boosted my productivity and eased my stress that I even wrote a quick blog post about it on LifeHacksHub. Now, I’m curious—has anyone else tried this? If you also tackle your hardest tasks early, how has it worked out for you? Or maybe you’ve got other morning routines or hacks that help kick-start your day? I’d love to hear your stories and tips! (I’m always on the lookout for ways to improve my routine 😊).",2,1739844727.0,productivity,2,0.67,False

[Aren’t we too old for this?]  [Flirty] [Friends to Lovers] [Confessions] [Sleepy Listener] [Chatty Speaker] [SFW],"**Note:** A4A means truly A4A, all are welcome to make it their own, please feel welcome to edit slightly to make the script fit your desired gendered-preferences. This includes tweaking lines about any physical bodies to better fit whatever you’re going for. This script is SFW, but still intended for an adult audience. 

Any monetization is fine by me, but send links if you do use my work. 

**Word count:** 1,500

**Summary:** 
You and an old friend decide to play truth or dare where it becomes more and more obvious that the truth you both are dancing around is that you have feelings for each other. 

*(italics)* - Unvoiced notes & stage direction/sounds 
**(…)** - silence for listener response 

**Script Below:**

“Oh, come on. It’s not *that* late yet… it’s what time….? (*laughs*) It’s not even nine. I know it’s been a few years since you’ve had to pull an all-nighter but we were night owls once.”

“And it’s a Friday! We both know you’re not working tomorrow, so please... rally a little? Don’t fade on me just yet.” 

(*Laughs*) “You’re totally falling asleep on me. And don’t even pretend you weren’t. You know I’m right. I wouldn’t even want you trying to get home like this, you’ll either have to spend the night on my couch or let me help you wake up a little. What? I’d worry for you otherwise. Come on, just say you’ll stick around a little longer.”

“Good. You want another drink? I can grab you another beer. Or maybe coffee…?” 

“Your eyes are literally already closed. I know you’re tired. And you were the one who always said it’s never too late for coffee. Especially when you need it, and well… you need it.”

(*laughs*) “Okay fine… maybe we can find another way to keep you awake… maybe we could play a game?”

“Hmmm… (*thinking aloud*) what kind of game? Oh, want to play Truth or Dare?”

“No… we’re not *too old* to still play it. Anyone can play it. Besides, maybe it’ll be a good excuse for me to get you moving to wake up a little. You are already half asleep on my couch as it is.” 

“If you want, I’ll even let you go first… I pick Truth.” 

**(…)**

“Hey! That’s not fair- I thought we’d agreed earlier that we would not be talking about my love life tonight? You can’t-“

“Okay, okay. Fine. You’re right. It’s truth or dare. I said ‘truth’ but going forward, can we set some ground rules?”

“Yeah. I mean, we’re friends, I know I don’t really have to worry about this but let’s just say ‘no stupid dares’. We’re not teenagers anymore. So for instance if you dared me to go streaking around the block, I’m not going to do it. I don’t really think you’d ask that, but I’m not going to ask you to do that either. And for truth… I’ll answer it this time but *maybe* we get one skip. And if I say “skip” you can’t ask about it again. Okay?”

**(…)**

“Okay good. So, right…  since you asked, it didn’t work out. I know I usually don’t tell you about when I go on dates and it was stupid of me. It was kind of the first one I’d had in a little while and I guess I got a little excited, but yeah… We didn’t really *click*. So, does that answer your question?”

“Okay. Moving on - truth or dare?”

**(…)**

“Of course you picked truth! I might have actually dared you to do something that would help wake you up. And we can’t have that now can we? Alright, then okay. Tell me… what’s your type?” 

“Come on, I never bug you with questions about your love life. But you started it, so let’s see how you like it.” 

**(…)**

“You can’t just say you don’t have a type. Everyone has a type. Maybe it’s not something as superficial as hair color or height, but when you’re swiping on an app, what catches your eye?”

“Alright, yeah, the apps suck. Let me rephrase, what is it that makes you like someone?” 

**(…)** 

“Of course you would say something totally cheesy like ‘kind eyes’ - who doesn’t have kind eyes? *Ugh* - why did I even waste a question? Let’s prove my point- do I have kind eyes?”

**(…)**

“Alright, alright. Fine, that’s a different question. It’s your turn then. Give me a dare.” 

**(…)**

*(Laughs.)* “I know I said no stupid dares… I should have seen this coming… No, don’t give me that look. It’s not stupid. I’ll do it. You just better not fall asleep on me. Just move over, let me sit up next to you…”

*(The rustle of fabric as the speaker sits on the couch.)*

“Just shift over a little… I don’t know if I’m any good at giving shoulder massages, but tell me if it hurts. Okay?” 

*(Optional sound effects: hands over fabric for duration of massage.)*

“How long should I go for the dare? It can’t be too long, this game is supposed to keep you awake.”

**(…)**

“Until it’s my turn again? Okay… I’m assuming that means you are picking Truth again, right? Yeah, real surprise.” 

“So I do have kind eyes… *(laughs)* that wasn’t what I was going to ask. So I still get another question…. So tell me, what’s your perfect date?” 

“Not like a first date. Like a *real* date… with someone you already really like.” 

**(…)**

“Yeah… *(listening along)* … okay… No, it’s nothing, it’s just kind of really cute… like you’ve actually thought about this before. Have you ever gotten to do that with someone? I mean… it’s not like you couldn’t. A lot of people would really be into going on a date like that… I mean, I think it sounds really nice…” 

“So, you haven’t yet… still saving it for someone special then. I think they’d know just by that date alone how much they mean to you.” 

“Okay… I can say I’ve completed my dare. Massage over. And you’re still awake. So, let’s go with Truth. Hit me with it.”

**(…)**

“Nope. *Skip.* I told you about my date the other day so we could drop it and move on. I don’t need to go into *why* we didn’t really click. I was really excited about it and then I wasn’t. Let’s leave it at that. It doesn’t matter. Ask another question.” 

**(…)**

“Ha, it’s okay. I like this question. I wouldn’t have asked it if I didn’t. My perfect date… oh! I know. Okay, okay, don’t laugh. This is one of those things that I’ve never done but I’ve had it in my head for about as long as I can remember. You know that little French bistro in town? It’s been there for as long as I’ve lived here at least. And it’s not even anything too fancy, but I’ve always thought of it as this great romantic spot. I’d want to go on a nice night, get a spot on their patio under the fairy-lights where it’s not too loud. We’d split a bottle of wine, maybe some crème brûlée, and talk for hours. *That* is pretty much all I’d want.”

**(…)**

“Well, *yeah,* I mean, I could do that with anyone but I haven’t. I don’t want to do that with just anyone. I’d want to do that with- with someone special. Someone that I would actually *want* to talk to for hours. Otherwise it’d be a pretty poor date.”

“Your turn. Truth or dare?”

**(…)**

“About time you picked Dare. I’ve got one. And this one’s going to be a challenge for you. I dare you to look me in the eye for thirty seconds straight without flinching.” 

**(…)**

“I’m totally serious. Thirty seconds feels a lot longer when it’s something like this. And your eyelids have been getting heavier and heavier the later it gets. So… are you up for it?”

**(…)**

*(Optional: click for timer start.)* 

“You’re allowed to blink. It’s not a staring contest. Just look into my eyes. That’s all… yeah, like that.” 

*(a moment of silence)* 

“Is it… umm, a little warm in here?”

*(another beat.)*

“I didn’t flinch. And I’m not the one doing the dare, by the way… yeah, you’re good.”

*(Timer goes off.)*

“Come on… I’m not- I can’t help it. I didn’t even think-“ *(breath hitches)* “I know I asked for this but… you were just staring at me, and - it just made me, uhh, a little nervous? I guess? I swear I’m fine.” 

**(…)**

“The Dare is over. You don’t have to keep looking at me like that now… Oh, *ha, ha!* you think it’s just hilarious to get me uh, … flustered…”

“I’m *not* blushing. It’s just warm in here. I can crack the window…” 

**(…)**

“Umm… Dare- no, actually Truth. Let’s go with Truth.” 

**(…)**

“No, skip!”

“I know I said we only get one skip… and *yeah* I get that this is a totally different question, you’re right, but-“

“I mean, you know already, right? That’s what this is all about, isn’t it? I know I’m kind of obvious… I don’t know of anyone else I’d want to rope into coming over on a Friday night. Even half asleep, I’m just so happy you’re here… You don’t need to rub it in my face.” 

**(…)**

“What do you mean? You don’t… you don’t know? Then, why did you ask? That wasn’t-“ (*sighs.*) “You really want to know if there’s someone I’m interested in?” 

“Interested is umm… kind of an understatement. I didn’t click with my date the other day because the whole time I was sitting there just thinking about how they weren’t you.” 

“You really can’t be this dense…” 

*(Speaker kisses listener.)*

*(whispers)* “I hope that was okay…” 

“Oh-“ *(Listener pulls speaker in for another kiss. A longer kiss.)*

*(breathy)* “So, you uh… you want this? I mean… us? To be-“

*(More kissing.)*

“You have no idea how long I’ve wanted this…”

*Italian Cheese Roll - same with their regular cheese roll, but herbs ang toppings instead of sugar. I like this one better than the regular cheese roll. Medyo pang-adult palate lang siya - I would not have liked this if I was a kid lol.

*Banana Crunch - sakto lang yung banana bread, pero na-elevate siya nung parang crunchy cookie bread crust on top. Ito yung next fave ko after ng Milky Cheesy Donut.

*Coffee Bun - Ok naman yung lasa overall, palpak lang yung texture. Akala ko parang coffee sauce yung sa taas, no - design lang pala lol. May parang crumbly an coffee flavored bread sa ilalim nung bun, pero sumasama/dumidikit sya sa wrapper. Kaya medyo hassle kainin.

You guys know my proclivity for back roads. It's been a great hang with cool people. A perfect spot to land. Got some work done. Had some good conversations. All in all... A real good time.

Last night kinda late... Me, ""I'm thinking about heading out. Unless you've got something else to do around here."" ""Not at the moment, but I will in a couple weeks. I'm going to Orlando tomorrow."" Shows me maps on his phone. ""Perfect. What time are you leaving in the morning?"" ""Six."" ""Ok, I'll get my gear packed tonight and be ready to go at six."" We stand around and shoot the shit for a while. Both retire to our respective rooms.

Gear packed. Clean clothes laid out for the morning. Movies watched. Smoke. Sleep.

Alarm goes off at five am. One snooze. Get up. Clean clothes on. Last few things packed. Kitchen. Coffee. Brief reddit post. Smoke. Bathroom. I hear dude moving through the house. Gear up. Check surroundings for anything I'm leaving behind. Out the door. Car.  ""Morning."" ""Morning."" Gear in car. Me in car. 'On the road again...'

Stop at a gas station. Dude, ""Breakfast stop."" ""Cool!"" While waiting around while he pumps gas, ""Here, take this with you.""  Tosses me a jar of resin concentrate. ""Nice! Thanks man!"" Inside gas station.

A smoked sausage egg and cheese biscuit. Whatever he got. Up to the register. ""You need smokes?"" ""Yep."" Me to cashier, ""A pack of Lucky Strike short reds please."" Back out to car. Hit the road.

Eat. Smoke. Shoot the shit. Dab pen. More shooting the shit. We get to the place he's working today. Gas station across street. Thanks on both sides. ""You got cash app? Let me give you some money. X amount good?"" ""That'll work."" Brief chat about more work in the near future. More thanks. Me out. Gear out. 

Inside gas station. Gallon of water. Out. Head to onramp...

'There's no on ramp here.' Maps. Two mile walk. Gas station. More coffee. Out around back. Smoke. Coffee. 'How am I gonna smoke this concentrate?' Google 'cause I don't know what these damn kids are into these days. 😆 Figure it out. 'Where's a smoke shop?' Maps. 'Right next door. Not bad.' Inside smoke shop.

Looking for a straw and a torch. Dude wasn't picking up what I was putting down. Nice guy. Obviously the fault is on my end. I roll the dice... ""For dabs."" ""Oh, for dabs? These are for dabs."" I have my gear on. It's pretty obvious I'm not rolling in cash. ""How much do you want to spend?"" ""Cheap."" ""Like fifty bucks?"" ""Yeah."" My newbie self walks out $65 later with something that will serve my purposes while still being backpack friendly. Outside. Instructions. New rig and contraband in pack, kinda buried but accessible.

'There's curb here. Not a very good place for cars to pull over.' Maps. .9 miles to end of curb. Walk. End of curb. Gear down. Thumb out.  Spy a Wendy's across the street. 'I am kinda hungry. Fuck it. I'm in no hurry.' Gear up. Cross street. Eat. Bathroom, mainly to load this new toy I have. They told me to be prepared when I was a boy scout. 😁 Out. Back across street. Gear down. 'To quote Chris Stapleton... Might as well get stoned. It definitely makes hitchhiking better.' Substance abuse handled. Thumb out.

I waited there for hours. Nice calm spot. Steady cars, but with enough of a pause that your arm doesn't get tired. Some guy came out of the rear window of a car going by and said, ""Get the fuck out of Florida!"" 'Yeah. No shit. I'm on my way out now.' This is cracking me up. I've been smiling like the young hippy kid in a tie-dye I was thirty years ago. Now I'm laughing at the absurdly of this young dumb fuck telling a traveler to get the fuck out of Florida.Two minutes later. Hear a honk. Look over.

A van pulled over a ways away. Dude is waving me over. Gear up. Over to van. Passenger door opens before I get there. Gotta appreciate that. Brief hellos. Gear in back. Me and water jug in front. (Fucking cottonmouth.) Brief talk. Dude tells me he's from Cuba, reaches into his center console and pulls out one of several bags of white powder.

Now I'm not saying any powder is good. And I definitely don't recommend doing hard drugs. Especially out here... But I've built things like hospitals and then spent thousands on some really good rocks. Butter crack we used to call it. You know... the really good shit. 

So when a Cuban guy says it's cocaine and it's really clean, and you can tell by looking at it it's definitely some clean shit, he says it's totally free for you if you want it, you're thinking, 'Cocaine from a Cuban? Aren't those *the* cocaine guys?'... 

You take it and get the fucking job done...

Nah. Just fucking with you! 😆😆😆 I politely declined with a bit of, ""I did a lot of that when I was younger. I'm too old now."" 😆

We shoot the shit. He drops me a few miles up the road. Asks if I need cigaros, food, beer, anything? ""I'm good man. Thank you!"" Check the time. It's been twenty-five minutes since I started hitchhiking. 'That weed is fire!' as the whippersnappers say. 😆.

Back out to road. Gear down. Thumb out. 'Might as well get familiar with this new toy...' I'm starting to pace when there's a break in the cars. 'Gotta keep moving to stay moving.' A work van pulles over. Takes me to the 50/502(?) split. Gear down. Thumb out. 

I'm stoned as a creek rock. I love the weed, but I don't typically operate on this level. Grinning my ass off. It's all I can do to keep from laughing hysterically. I'm trying to find the 'good enough smile that someone will want to take me with them, but not obviously fucked up smile... Fuck iiiiiiiit. The world needs more smiles!' 

Get picked up by a guy going to Titusville. Takes me up the 1 as far as he's going. Right to the post office where I had the only time I called a woman a cunt. And in public no less. Anf it was the head of the post office. (That fuckin' !!#!#$!&?@!#!$!&!) 

Sorry. So I got my gear on grabbed my water jug, and promptly got the fuck out of there. Bus stop nearby. 'I don't remember the routes up here. Might as well drop this gear smoke a cigarette and figure out what I'm doing next.'

Bus in forty minutes. It would take the same amount of time to walk there, but that three mile walk earlier is setting in a little. I'm hanging on the wrong side of the street. The back of the bus stop bench is blocking most of the wind coming off the water. The sun is shining on the front of me. This is the spot to sit. That other side where I have to catch the bus looks brutal. (Granted, I just put my hoody on when I got here. It's not that cold.)

About thirty minutes later I cross the street. Go in Dunkin Donuts looking for a bathroom. ""We do, but there for paying customers only."" ""That's fine. I'll grab a coffee."" ""Yeah, over there on your left."" ""Thanks!"" Obvious where we're going here...

Out To counter. ""You don't have to get something if you don't want anything. It's just to discourage.. from wreckin' the place."" ""Yeah. I get it."" ""Enjoy your trip and stay safe out there!"" ""Thank you! Have a good one!"" ""You too! Thanks!""

Side note: While I am well provisioned, so far I've had a Mike's harder lemonade and two Tylenol for dinner. I think that lemonade might be catching up with me at this point. 😆 'Will he go get another one? He did say he does drink some times...'

Bus. I figured out how to see where a bus goes on it's complete route. Get off early at a library next to a dollar general. Charge phones. Groceries. Across street. Into woods. Gear down. Tent up. Me and gear inside. Tango with Mike... 'Kinda hungry...  ",8,1739844576.0,vagabond,1,0.83,False

The Murder Machine Dance Party was a spectacle Yvian would never forget. Alas, all good things must come to an end. After one hour, two minutes, and thirty seven seconds, the Peacekeeper units all stopped. They went back to what they were doing as if nothing had happened. Eighty million comm requests cut off all at once.

Several more comm requests remained. Most of them were Lissa's problem. There was a sizeable staff of administrators in charge of running the Pixen Technocracy, and they all wanted to talk to the boss. There was also a reporter. Danil Starlancer from *Spacedock Weekly*. Yvian didn't know how he'd found out about their return so quickly, but he wanted an interview. Yvian shuddered at the thought. Fortunately, public relations was also Lissa's problem.

The last comm request was from Warmaster Scathach. Yvian answered that one herself. ""Scargiver!"" the Warmaster shouted. ""Call them off!""

""What?"" Scargiver was what Scathach called Mims. She looped him into the call. ""It's for you.""

""This is Mims,"" the human said. ""What's going on?""

""Your machines are massacring the Empire,"" Scathach growled. ""They're laying waste to Starfang as we speak! Call them back!""

Yvian took another look at her sensor feed. The Peacekeeper presence was pretty light. There were a dozen Peacekeeper Queenships, half a million Peacekeeper Stinger units, and another couple million conventional warships. More than enough to protect the sector, but much less than she usually saw. The rest must be in Vrrl space.

""You should do as he says,"" Exodus cut in and advised. ""My Peacekeepers stopped killing while they were celebrating your return, but they've resumed their extermination. They'll extinguish all life on Starfang Prime in a matter of hours.""

The human blinked, then swore. ""Can you talk to them?""

""It will be better if they hear it from you,"" said the Genocide. ""I'll patch you through to them.""

Mims nodded, then spoke. ""Attention all Peacekeeper units. This is Mims. I want everyone in Vrrl space to drop what you're doing and come back to Empty Night Sector. Do it now. Mims out.""

The human waited a moment, then asked, ""Exodus? They doing it?""

""Check for yourself,"" said the Genocide. ""I'm not your errand boy.""

Mims grunted. ""Kilroy?""

""This unit is not your errand boy either, Big Daddy Mims,"" the Peacekeeper informed him. His eyes were a steady blue. Yvian didn't blame him. Kilroy had been clinging to the idea that he was standard for a long time. Suddenly finding himself different and alone was not something he'd shake off in a minute. At least his eyes weren't flashing or glowing black. If he had enough wherewithal to sass the human, he'd probably be alright. Eventually.

""Just check please, Kilroy,"" Yvian ordered.

""Scargiver?"" She heard Scathach on the other frequency. ""Is it done?""

""Hold on a second, Warmaster,"" Mims told him.

""The message was received, Captain Mother Yvian,"" Kilroy reported. ""All units are returning to this sector."" His eyes flashed red. ""The units are very angry, Captain Mother Yvian. They very much want to continue murdering the meatbags.""

""Good to know,"" said Yvian. ""Thanks, Kilroy."" She nodded at Mims.

The human spoke on the comm. ""You still there, Scathach?""

""I'm here,"" the Warmaster growled. ""Have the Peacekeepers stopped?""

""Yeah,"" he told him. ""They're on their way here as we speak."" He frowned. ""We're coming to meet you. Is there anything else that can't wait til we get there?""

""No."" The Warmaster chuffed. ""Nothing I want to share on open comms.""

""Then we'll see you in a few hours,"" said the human. ""Mims out.""

""Captain Mother Yvian,"" Kilroy spoke up. ""This unit has a matter that must be attended to.""

""Understood,"" Yvian told him. Crunch, he looked miserable. ""We've got you covered.""

""Thank you."" Kilroy didn't run off at two hundred kilometers per hour this time. He trudged off the bridge with slow heavy steps. Yvian was tempted to follow him. Try to comfort him somehow. She shook her head. It wouldn't help. Kilroy needed to be alone.

""I love you, Kilroy,"" she whispered. ""I'm here if you need me.""

Kilroy didn't answer. Yvian hadn't expected him to. She knew he'd heard, and that was enough. She checked the sensors again. The *Dream of the Lady* was on course for Shipyard 71. The Warmaster's destroyer was still docked there. The rest of the sector was full of ships and activity, but nothing that would constitute a threat. There wasn't anything left to do but wait.

""Mims?"" Yvian asked. ""Can you take charge for a bit? I have to... I have to take care of something.""

""Lot of that going around today, Captain."" The human shrugged. ""Go ahead. I'll call you if something important happens.""

""Thanks."" Yvian made her way to her quarters. She switched off her wrist console's comm connections. She set it to record. She sat there, silent. She didn't know what to say.

Yuriko thought she was dead. Or at least, she had. The human woman was the only connection Yvian had outside of her ship. She was the closest Yvian had come to love. She'd rejected Yvian in the end, but... Yvian sighed.

Yvian erased the several minutes of silence she'd recorded. She tried again. ""Yuriko, it's um... me. Yvian. I'm alive. I'm sorry. I didn't... If I'd known... If I knew my death was going to faked I would have warned you.""

Yvian's eyes were watering. She switched the console to record audio only. ""I'm sorry, Yuriko. You were right not to want me. You were right. What I do is dangerous. I could die at any time. I just wish..."" She choked back a sob. ""I just miss you, I guess. I'm so tired of being so alone.""

Yvian closed her eyes, centered herself. It didn't make her feel better, but she got her breathing back under control. ""So much has happened. There's so much I want to tell you. But I can't. I can't tell you anything."" She let out a shuddering breath. ""I don't think you'd want to hear it anyway. It was all just for fun, right? You don't... You don't want to love me. I'm sorry, Yuriko. I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I just... I just wanted you to know that I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. I would have liked to love you if I could. You know. But you were right. You were right and I'm sorry.""

Yvian turned off the recording. She cried for a while. Then she pulled herself together and walked down to engineering. Engineering was a big space, but it was so full of consoles and equipment that it felt small. Three reactors took up the center of the room. Big cylindrical things, covered in cables and conduits. Smaller reserve generators took up one side of the room. On the other side were the Nodes. There were three of them.

Nodes were quantum technology. Like the Jumpdrive. They used quantum resonance to ignore distance, allowing instant communication. Yvian moved to the Node on the left. She switched it to the configuration that led to Black Mesa Station. She uploaded her message. She reset the Node and made her way back to the bridge.

Kilroy returned an hour later. Yvian could guess what he had been doing. He'd fabricated a hat band to add to his fancy fedora. Most Peacekeepers did not have hat bands. The only other one she'd seen belonged to Peacekeeper unit Ender Zhukov, the non-standard unit that served as the general of the Peacekeepers. Zhukov's band had been white. Kilroy's was the same shade of blue as his eyes. Lissa had asked about it, but Kilroy had refused to explain.

They reached Shipyard 71 a few hours later. Shipyard 71 was a barebones sort of place. The Peacekeepers had built it quick and dirty, using a pre-fab station kit of Krog design. Like everything else from the Krog, it was well made and aesthetically pleasing. The station was a ninety kilometer long rectangle, but it had sweeping curves where the edges would be. Dozens of Pixen battlecruisers were docked inside, as well as Warmaster Scathach's Pridewing class destroyer.

The *Dream of the Lady* docked without incident. The crew disembarked to find the docking bay filled with Peacekeeper units. Yvian could see more Peacekeepers lining the corridor through the open bay door. Each of the machines was holding a black cane with a white tip. The moment Yvian stepped off the ramp, old timey human music began to play. The Peacekeepers danced.

""Puttin' on the Ritz?"" Mims muttered. ""Really?""

The units heard him. Their eyes were flashing yellow. With perfect synchronicity, they twirled their canes and tapped their feet. The Peacekeepers hadn't left enough space to squeeze into the corridor. Yvian and her crew had no choice but to stand and watch. When the song completed, the machines snapped upright. They raised their canes high. Their eyes glowed white. The Anthem of the Machines started playing.

Mims made his body rigid, then pressed a fist to his heart. So did Kilroy. Lissa and Scarrend followed suit a moment later. Yvian gave them a quizzical look. Mims glowered and jerked his head at Yvian. Oh. Right. He was standing at attention. She should, too. Yvian stood straight and pressed a fist to her chest.

When the Anthem was finally over, the Peacekeepers let out a big cheer. Lissa grinned and waved at them. Mims gave a respectful nod. Only now did the machines open a path to the corridor. They stood at attention, fists pressed against the part of their chassis that would hold their hearts if they were meatbags.

Peacekeeper units lined the hallways all the way down to the conference room where the Warmaster was waiting. Yvian and the crew had to walk single file to avoid brushing up against them. The machines held their salute for the entire trip, silent statues with glowing white eyes. It was sweet, but kind of disturbing. Very Peacekeeper-like.

The conference room was a modest space. There was a long rectangular table in the center of the room. Another smaller table stood against a bulkhead. There were coffee and snacks on it. The walls, floor, and ceiling were plain steel, but someone had hung a banner against the far wall. The banner was blue, with the symbol of the Homestar at its center in gold.

Two Vrrl were waiting inside the conference room. Warmaster Scathach was in his usual stance, feet spread, all four hands tucked behind his back. He wore a black leather skirt, a leather vest, and a cape made of scalps. He was trying and failing to be his usual picture of composure. Scathach looked haggard. His white fur and red mane were matted, and the three scars tracing down his face looked angrier than usual.

The other Vrrl looked familiar, but Yvian didn't know from where. He was big, as big as Scathach. His fur was orange with black stripes. His mane was bone white. The creature wore the same skirt and vest as Scathach, but his scalp cape had bones threaded through it that clinked when he moved. A polished skull hung from a chain around his neck. The skull had once belonged to a sapient, but Yvian wasn't sure what species. The back of it was oddly elongated.

Scathach moved before Yvian could ponder the matter further. He dropped all pretense of calm, rushing forward with a thunderous shout. ""Scarrend!""

Scarrend moved to meet him. The two of them embraced in a crushing hug. ""My son!"" Scathach cried. They nuzzled their cheeks against each other. Yvian heard rumbling purrs. After a few moments, Scathach set Scarrend down. Then he hugged him again. ""I thought you were dead.""

""A necessary ruse, father."" Scarrend wiped at his eyes. Scathach was crying openly. Yvian noticed the orange Vrrl watching the two of them with quiet approval. ""One I was not expecting. I would have warned you if I could.""

""It's better that you didn't,"" the Warmaster told him. ""There are few things as convincing as honest grief.""

""True."" Scarrend nodded. He was still purring. ""It is good to smell you again, father.""

""Words cannot express how pleased I am to smell you, son."" Scathach clapped all four hands on Scarrend and stepped back. He straightened, placing his hands back behind his back. ""We'll catch up later, but for now there is other business to attend to.""

""Indeed,"" the orange Vrrl rumbled. He stepped closer, running the back of one hand across his cheek. Then he rubbed the same hand across Lissa's cheek. ""Ms. Kiver. I am gratified that you live. Every time I smell you, you seem less like food.""

""Emperor Tybert,"" Lissa smiled at him. ""It's good to see you too.""

""It's just Tybert now,"" the Vrrl told her. Rage flashed across his face, replaced by calm just as quickly. He shook his head. ""The Vrrl Starfang Empire has fallen. I am Emperor no more.""",11,1739844504.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Internship season is more than just a summer gig—it's your golden opportunity to land that dream job before you even graduate. 

Internship season is here, and let’s be honest—you're not just in it for the summer experience. You want that full-time offer. You want to take this opportunity and turn it into a launchpad for your career. But here's the kicker: Not all internships are created equal. Some companies treat interns like future hires, while others just need an extra pair of hands. So how do you position yourself as a must-hire employee and not just a temporary summer gig?

We’ve gathered insights from professionals across industries to help you navigate your internship like a pro. Whether you’re an engineering student, a business major, or diving into data science, these actionable tips will help you stand out, impress your managers, and increase your chances of securing that coveted job offer.

# 1. Find Out If the Company Offers Full-Time Roles

Before you even step foot into your internship, you need to determine whether the company uses internships as a hiring pipeline. How? Ask directly. During the interview or onboarding process, simply say:

*“Does this internship have the potential to turn into a full-time role?”*

If the answer is yes, great—you know what you’re working toward. If not, you can still make valuable connections and gain experience, but you may want to explore other opportunities after the summer.

# 2. Prepare Before Day One

First impressions start before you even log in or step into the office. Take the initiative to research the company, its products, and its technologies. If possible, reach out to your manager before your start date to introduce yourself and express enthusiasm for the role. This simple step shows initiative and gets you on their radar early.

# 3. Stand Out During Your Internship

So, you’ve landed the internship. Now what? Here's how to set yourself apart:

# A. Be Likable and Build Relationships

It’s not just about technical skills—soft skills matter. A hiring manager told us that given a choice between a technically brilliant but grumpy intern and a socially adept intern with solid (but not superstar) skills, they’d choose the latter every time.

* Be enthusiastic and engaged.
* Put your phone away during meetings.
* Be someone people enjoy working with—collaborate, communicate, and contribute positively to the team culture.

# B. Take Ownership and Be Proactive

Don’t just complete tasks—own them.

* Set up regular 1:1s with your manager.
* Clarify expectations and understand success metrics.
* Keep a record of your projects and accomplishments.
* Always ask for feedback—and apply it.

Showing initiative and tracking your work makes it easier for your manager to advocate for you when it’s decision time.

# C. Network Beyond Your Immediate Team

Your internship isn’t just about your specific tasks—it’s about growing your network.

* Schedule coffee chats with employees from different departments.
* Be intentional—ask thoughtful questions and learn from their career paths.
* Keep a concise and engaging ‘About Me’ slide to introduce yourself.

The more people who know and like you, the more advocates you’ll have when it’s time to convert your internship into a job offer.

# 4. Make It Clear You Want a Full-Time Role

Here’s where many interns drop the ball: they assume their manager knows they want a full-time role. Don’t leave it to chance. Make it clear.

* During your check-ins, ask: *“What does it take to qualify for a return offer?”*
* Understand the evaluation process and what “exceeds expectations” means.
* At the end of your internship, explicitly express your interest in staying with the company.

Some managers don’t realize their interns want to stay—spell it out for them.

# 5. Even If You Don’t Get an Offer, Stay Connected

Not getting a return offer isn’t the end of the road. The relationships you’ve built during your internship can lead to opportunities in the future.

* Keep in touch with your manager and colleagues.
* Follow up with a thank-you email.
* Stay engaged on LinkedIn and continue networking.

Companies change, hiring needs evolve, and you never know when a past internship connection might lead to your next big opportunity.

Your internship is more than just a summer job—it’s a golden opportunity to set yourself up for long-term career success. By taking initiative, networking intentionally, and making your intentions clear, you can significantly increase your chances of securing that full-time offer. And even if you don’t, the skills, relationships, and experience you gain will be invaluable as you move forward in your career.

Now, go out there and make your internship count!



# FAQ: Everything You Need to Know About Turning an Internship into a Full-Time Job

# 1. How early should I start asking about full-time opportunities?

Start gathering information during your first few weeks. In your first 1:1 with your manager, ask about the potential for a return offer and what you need to do to earn one.

# 2. What should I do if my internship doesn’t guarantee full-time roles?

Still give it your best. Impress people, build strong relationships, and maintain a good reputation. Even if they don’t have a position now, they might in the future—or refer you elsewhere.

# 3. How do I make myself more memorable as an intern?

Be proactive, show enthusiasm, take initiative, and contribute to the team culture. Engage in networking and demonstrate that you’re invested in the company’s success.

# 4. How do I ask my manager for a full-time job without sounding desperate?

Frame it as a professional interest. Say something like: *“I really enjoy working here, and I’d love to continue contributing to the team. What steps should I take to be considered for a full-time role?”*

# 5. What if I don’t get an offer?

It’s not a failure! Maintain your connections, seek feedback, and use the experience to strengthen your resume. Often, an internship at one company can lead to full-time opportunities elsewhere.",1,1739844242.0,stem_jobs,0,1.0,False

The label on ON Protein says 1 scoop (about 32g). Well, 32g is slightly over 2tbsp. 

Turns out I already have a coffee scoop/funnel that's 2tbsp, awesome! Well, being me I tested it, and it only filled up the ON provided scoop halfway. So, I grabbed a 1TBSP measure out of my drawer, and 2 of those only filled the provided scoop halfway.

So, is the serving size based on WEIGHT and not volume? Is the provided serving scoop wrong? (Maybe a way to make you use the product faster and therfore buy more often?) ",0,1739844190.0,Supplements,1,0.5,False

1is1gaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1is1gaf/seating_for_floating_dinner/,seating for floating dinner?,"Hi all! My fiance and I are opting for a floating dinner instead of a traditional sit down for our backyard wedding of 150 guests. We're hoping it'll be like a 4.5 hour long ""cocktail hour."" We plan to have light appetizers passed around during the first hour, along with grazing tables (one for meat eaters, one for vegetarians) and a salsa/guac/chips station (our catered food is mexican). After the initial hour, we will open up the larger taco station and will continue with the passed appetizers. Eventually, the grazing tables will be replaced by dessert/coffee tables.

We're choosing this format because we find that we prefer to not be tied down to specific seat at a wedding, and prefer to mingle openly/wander about (as do most of our guests--big lively families, lol). 

The conundrum here comes with seating--we're obviously not doing assigned seating, and will instead put out about 12 round tables throughout the property (even mix of 48"" and 60""--some under the tent near the dance floor, some out on the lawn further away from the hubbub). This will accommodate between 85-90 chairs. We also have 10 hi-top tables scattered about, particularly near the main bar/food area and the dance floor/2nd bar, but without chairs. Additionally, we have 3 different ""lounge"" areas that consist of deck/patio furniture (benches, couches, lounge chairs etc) and one HUUUGE picnic table that accommodates like 20 people. Does this seem like enough seating? Most often people mention that older people need to sit, but 75% of our guests are under the age of 35. 

  
We're hoping that most people will be mingling/dancing, so we personally feel like 90 chairs, plus the various lounge areas, plus the picnic bench = enough seating. Moreover, we'll have 150 chairs on site since we need that many for the ceremony, so we can always pull more out if need be. However, my mom thinks that we need to display one chair for every guest (in addition to all the lounge spaces). Should it be fine as is, or is she right?  If she's right, could just adding chairs to the hi top tables work?

I don’t know if this is pro/Revenge or a cry for therapy or what but it's something. (sorry for the grammar English is my second langue)

Growing up every summer my dad would take the 12+ hour drive from our state to drop us off at my grandparents for the summer and pick us back up near the end of summer. 12+ HOURS of you and four little baby chicks fighting over imaginary territory lines and continuously asking an endless number of questions and never knowing what peace is. That was what my dad put himself through every year till we were all old enough in his mind to be on our own. So, what is a short-tempered man that's losing his hair by the hour going to do with his beloved little baby chicks that won't shut up even if paid? He came up with a game.

 The  game went like this. In the beginning of the trip he would give us a riddle of some sort and we each got 3 turns to figure it out and if we said anything else that was a point against the talker and they were down a life. We could whisper or pass notes. And what do we get if we won? We got to go and eat at the ever elusive and classy *El McDonalds*. Back then this was gold to us, what we would do for a trip to *El McDonalds*! We won some and we lost most.

Get the game? Perfect! Now for the riddle that started this whole thing. Now my memory is fuzzy on HOW he said it in Spanish but it ruffly translates to ""**With what do you think** a flea bites"". 12+ hours Mark and none of us got it.  We struggled, we put our little bird heads together and tried to ask our cousins and multiple times we were wrong. What was the answer? His exacted words were ""You ***think*** with your head"".  I still call BS but whatever. We were so dumb struck we stayed quite as anger filled our little veins. For a whole YEAR he held that over us repeatedly telling us ""You got to be careful with the words you use"" ""pay attention to the words you use to agree with"" and pretty much just rubbing it in our face. This started a war of the words, instead of bringing us together in order to take this man down it divided us as we each wanted to be the ones to do it. For YEARS we tried to beat that man at the word game. None of us was sneaky or clever enough to get one past him. And we all gave up slowly- 

Till he went too far.

The year was 2005- that year we saw the first trailer for the movie ""Chicken little"". To us it was ""OMG so life like"", ""look at the animation"", "" that looks sooo cool"", and every little giddy thing that came to mind. We started to chirp and chirp around my dad and begged him to take us to see the movie. It was after all so ""life like"" and ""one of a kind"" to us back then. Now the movie theaters was a whole hour and a half away from our house and still a long drive back then just to see a movie. BUT after hours of endless chirping for weeks on end he finally relented to take us to see the movies. His words were ""If you behave, don't fight, keep your rooms clean, and help in the ranch I will take you to go see the movies"" Mark believe me when I tell you ***WE WERE ANGELS SENT FROM F#CKING ABOVE FOR A WHOLE @$$ MONTH***. I remember my parents getting so many complements from so many people about how well behaved and quite we were. **ANGELS, I TELL YOU**. After all that it was finally time, we got up early and dressed nicely for our trip to the movies. He asked us on our way if we wanted to stop by *El McDonalds* to eat before seeing the movies and we all said no because we wanted to save room for movie popcorn and candy. We passed four *El McDonalds* on the way and we always said no and after an hour and a half we made it to the movies, and we were so excited as we pulled up and all the pretty light were on, and we waited for our dad to say we could get out. Then it happened-

Dad- OK, we here we are. You guys see the movies?

All of us nodding our little heads - Yes!!!!

Dad- Ok, you saw the movies. Let's go home.

US- ????......

We thought he was joking as he pulled out the parking lot, we thought he would say ""just kidding"" and pull back into the parking lot-but he never did. I remember seeing the look in my siblings faces as I am 100% sure we all had a flash back to the stupid riddle and the year he kept rubbing it in our face ""be careful of the words"". We were quite the whole way back. And you know what Mark? This man had the audacity to pull into El McDonalds and get himself a coke. On that day our thirst for revenge was rekindled. **NO ONE** was safe, we used words against our friends, strangers, the mail man, our poor mom and anyone we could use as practice. But it was of no use as that old man was too strong and despite his lack of the proper English vocabulary, he never let us win. We began to lose hope once more.

AND THEN A MIRCLE HAPPENED.

For the first time we were not going to be dropped off at our grandparents for the summer and got to stay home because he had to go on a two week business trip and couldn't get the time to drop us off. We were a little upset we wouldn't be able to play in my uncles pool but ok. We begged our dad for a pool before he left till the day he left and I begged once more. He relented and said ""OK fine, dig a hole in the back and I'll fill it up with water once I get back"" and then he left that night. And that night as I happily went to bed thinking about the hole I was going to dig I noticed something. He never said how big or deep it had to be. He didn't **SAY HOW BIG IT** ***COULD*** **BE**. For two weeks I woke up with the sun and went to sleep with the sun. My siblings gave up halfway through the first day thinking we would get in trouble but because mom never stopped me and just sent me siblings to bring me food and water I kept doing at it.  Trouble?! I wasn't scared! This was a War of the Words! NO SUCH THING AS TROUBLE!  By the nearing end of the two weeks I dug a pretty big hole and was proud of it.  I can proudly say it was 12FT X 20FT and was 4FT on one end and gradually went to 6ft on the other. I had to use a ladder to get out. I went as far as flatting the dirt that piled up so he couldn't cover my hole up when he got back. At the end of the two weeks my dad came home late in the night. I happily ran into his arms reminding him of his promise and he tiredly said, ""ok ok- I'll fill it up in the morning"" and I smiled and went to bed praying my mom wouldn't tell him a thing and she didn't.

The next morning I heard the most beautiful scream of "" HIJO DE TU -"". I smiled. I was ready for the belt or to be grounded or shipped off to military school. I won and that was all that mattered. I waited for him to call me, but he never did and I ended up falling back to sleep. When I woke up there was breakfast on the table, my mom was smiling and my dad was nowhere to be seen. I wanted to ask where he was but then I heard his truck pull up and saw something blue in the back. After eating I went to do my chores around the ranch and saw him putting a tarp down with his friends  and starting to fill the hole with water. He smiled and told all his friends ""That's the one"" as he pointed at my and the all laughed. It took the hole day and night for the ""pool"" to properly fill.  We played to our hearts content that summer and the pool slowly turned into a pond for the ducks.

 But after that day the word game became OUR game. I lost most but I managed to get a few good ones in. He once managed to trick me with Spanish and English words that I had a younger half-sister in Mexico I never knew I had and he was going to go pick her up for Christmas at the end of the year to join us and I should make her feel welcomed. He got my whole family to make me believe that. For a whole year they convinced me I had a half-sister born out of a one night stand and she was coming to live in the USA. I spent that whole year getting gifts for her hoping to welcome her and make her feel at home and so that she would have lots of gifts under the tree when she came and wouldn't be scared. When December came he really did go to Mexico to pick up a kid, only it wasn't his kid, it was the next door neighbor daughter.  This poor girl was so confused when I hugged her and took her to our house to show her all the gifts under the tree that were for her.  They still tell that story every Christmas and that girl calls me her American sister.

The game continued till we got too busy with life and we only ever play it half heartly or just bring out the stories of it when family gathers. It wasn't until recently that is.

My dad recently got home sick for Mexico and said he wanted to see Mexico and we planned a trip there in 2022, restrictions lighten and the boarders were pretty much deserted still.  So we made sure we had everything , I didn't really want to go but my parents are starting to get too old to drive 12+ hours nonstop, so I went to help with the drive and say hi to family. For WEEKS he looked forward to going back to his home town and kept talking about the place he wanted to see and so on and so on. He made sure his passport was UpToDate, his papers were good and he had money to spend and a months' worth of new clothes packed. We take the 12+ hour drive from hell (  A LOT of things happened from ill omen birds to slashed tires) from our state to the boarder. I could feel the old man get giddy with every inch closer we got.  And finely we had to get off and talk to the people to get permission to get in the country. I remember it was 3AM and I wasn't allowed to pass the red and blue line to get a cup of coffee (still mad about that), all the paperwork was good and the passports passed and we were ready to go but wait what's this? The tags? The tags to my dad's truck expired the day before and none of us noticed. So unless we wanted to walk the rest of the way there we would not be allowed in. I felt so bad as my dad got back in the truck with my mom as he wondered how he forgot about the tags and he looked longingly to Mexico, it was right there, he was so close… and then I opened my big mouth.

Me- Hey Pa, you wanted to see Mexico, right? Well, there it is, you see it. Now let's go home.

The truck went quiet. My mom and dad slowly turned to me and my mom shocked looks from me to my dad and then my dad looks like he remembered something from way back and he busts out laughing and we pull out and head home. We stop by El McDonalds and eat and now the word game is back in full swing. Only now it's my dad and I VS my sibling's kids. And so far, we have yet to lose.



Some say our games are cruel and petty, but we know where the lines are drawn and who is a real player.  And yes, it is mean and petty but it's also fun. I'm not sure if it’s turned into a prank type of game now were you use words to deceive one another but it keeps my old man on his toes and giddy.  I'm even planning a grand slam for 2026 Christmas. No way I'm letting these young ones win.

 

Well Mark I hope this got a chuckle out of you and yours.  With love and care OP

# Episode 16: Oh Sh*t Moments

Number Ranking: 10/10

Tier Rank: S

I don’t know if it’s me but Bob kind of sounds weird throughout the entire episode. Like his voice is different. Doesn’t take anything away from the episode, just thought I would point that out. Also, I have to point out, Bob is definitely not the worst host. I’m not gonna say who is my least favorite, but it’s definitely not Bob. Immediately out the gate this episode is making me laugh. Wade opens up, saying the world is stealing his hair, teenagers are stealing his wife, his house is stealing his water, absolute banger of an opening. Molly needing more mud made me chuckle. Wade is a man who owns five toilets. God, the most toilets I’ve ever seen inside of the house is 2. Who the fuck needs 5 toilets? “The spickedy spookedy inside the backedy backedy”, floors me. This episode started the “my dogs are fine, thanks for asking” bit. The unholy shit story is just another Bob banger. I come back to this episode JUST for this story. Loved Mark's meatloaf story gets me to chuckle. I unironically want to try the sugar free gummy bears. The sugar free gummy bears stories are always so fucking funny. I love how Wade describes drinking juice as “drained it”. Wade’s apple juice story was also funny. I had a similar experience with my appendicitis. I too thought it was gas and sat on the toilet. Writhed in pain all night long. Stayed up all night due to the pain. Ended up on the couch crying. Doctors told me I was so close to bursting. No tumor though. Nn rocks in the pee pee. Cannonball sized kidney stone is scary and comical. The bad news worse news bit was funny. Man, this episode just kept getting shittier and shittier. Blasting shit back to the past. The whole medieval time and the shitaceous period bit is something I think of. The whole Lycasin and NEOZORB talk was great. Man. What a shitty episode. Literally, like 80% of this episode was shit. It’s just one of the best episodes, hands down. I come back to this episode often, Bob’s shit story will always never not be funny.

# Episode 17: How Dare You

Number Ranking: 9/10

Tier Rank: A

Mark describing the beds as delicious was funny. PEEN HOUSE, PEEN HOUSE, PEEN HOUSE! How come Mark hasn’t held up to his end of the stick when he said he would move back if Wade won? The “two wrongs make a wrwrongongong”, is so fucking funny. The hot-chocolate story is one that I think of occasionally. I remember working in a retail store. I would buy a single gallon of purified water to drink from over the course of the week. Even though I would put my name on it I found out my managers were using my gallon of water to fill up the coffee pots. Boy was I mad. There was this girl in one of my classes who asked the teacher to use the restroom.The teacher said no and the girl kept saying it was an emergency. He persisted and she ended up swapping out her period pad in the middle of class. Pulled out the used one, threw it in the trash, grabbed a new one and left the class to put on the new one. Class was very awkward when she came back. As someone who was in the lower brass section (I was a baritone) it is very true that tuba’s (and the lower brass section in general) kinda just fuck around. If my band director called me out (I was first chair baritone for a brief moment in time) I don’t know what I would’ve done. Wade stepping up and teaching a class is such a mood. Mark talking about shot put and discus reminds me of my Junior year where the entire off season was forced to join. I had never done shot put or discus before. I remember that I was at a meet and I was throwing a discus and one of the staff members came up to me in the middle of my throws just to tell me I needed to throw it farther. Not in a trying to give me advice kinda a way and more in a him not knowing why I was at the meet sorta way. I felt like shit after that. Hearing Wade being blunt with his shitty professor and getting an A hits my currently-in-college heart so hard. He did what I imagine doing in my mind sometimes. I haven’t had professors that unfair, but goddamn have I dealt with some annoying professors. Holy shit, Bob and Wade talking about their terrible work bathroom stories reminds me of another personal anecdote. I worked in retail during high school and a bit of college and the worst day of work was when some pissed, shit, and came all over the men’s restroom. That particular day I walked into work with another coworker hosing down the men’s restroom because they found the shit log that was left on the floor. They were almost done by the time I got there so thank God I didn’t have to clean that up. Later that evening I went to take out all of the trash in the building. I get to the bathroom and start getting the trash. I noticed some clear liquid on part of the trashcan and wall that had gotten on my hands. I thought it was some left over water from the shit hosing that was done hours prior. I went to grab a paper towel and noticed that the one I grabbed was already wet. I throw it away and grab another. Still wet. At this point I noticed my hands were getting slippier and slippier between my fingers. Examining the clear liquid closer and I had the sudden horrific realization. It’s semen. And it’s on my hands. Frantically I start trying to wash my hands from the slippery feeling on my hands. It won’t go away. After a while of washing under hot water bi go to dry my hands. The paper towels were still wet. I open up the paper towel dispenser to see what the fuck is up. When I opened the dispenser I saw the ENTIRE paper towel roll was drenched and now there is a distinct odor in the air. Piss. I leaned in closer to the piss covered paper towel roll to see if that was the source of the stench. Yep, definitely piss. At this point my brain was already fried with the thought of another man’s potential descendants being on my hands, I now realize that not only was that the case but now my hands are covered in the same guys PISS. I almost broke down. I went out to the other sink in the break room, washed my hands for about 10 minutes and went to my manager to tell them about the terrible war crimes I just dealt with in the men’s restroom. They got someone else to go start cleaning up the bathroom and I wore latex gloves for the rest of the shift. I. Wanted. To. Die. Customers fucking suck. While I wouldn’t argue this is one of the best episode compared to some of the others, this is an episode I relate to heavily. Quality episode.

# Episode 18: Dreams & Nightmares

Number Ranking: 6.5/10

Tier Rank: D

As a college student I appreciate the small talk at the beginning. Imagine not being able to imagine. Bob can’t, what a nerd!! Seriously tho, I couldn’t imagine not being able to imagine visually. I looked up the imagine apple image and I’m a complete 1. I can imagine a 3d hyper realistic rotating apple. I’m the complete opposite of aphantastic. I do not often have dreams that I remember tho. And if I do remember it’s usually too vague. I remember nightmares more often than just regular dreams. Maybe it’s because I’m only a junior in college I do have many memories related to each year of school. I honestly thought this was the episode where Wade coined the “fuck your dreams, fuck your nightmares. Kinda disappointed it wasn’t.

So, as the title suggests, I'm 20 right now with around a $20,000 NW total. Not amazing, I suppose, with my goals (I wanted to be at around $50,000 by this point in my plan at 14, but I have lost a lot on bad investments or failed businesses), I am currently working in marketing in around 6 countries, so no real ties to any countries, global investment (just because it's a passion project of mine) and entrepreneurship (started businesses in a variety of industries), US citizen currently living in Albania moving to Armenia in the near future to lower taxes - current ""consistent"" return (past performance) in investments @ \~70% (expected returns nearer to 20% YoY in developing markets), have nearly 0 lifestyle creep (live on less than $1,000/month), set to make around $60,000/year personally - hope to increase pay at around a 20%/year rate with businesses growing as fast as they are, to achieve a minimum $ of income into investments of $10,000/month by the age of 23, without increasing expenses - then after 23, slight lifestyle creep as I plan to start dating at that point (so, doubling my budget per year to $24,000).

  
With that said, am I insane for holding this high a standard for myself, or am I just doing what it takes? I'm sure some of this will be confirmation bias/motivation however my parents consistently tell me I'm not spending enough ""to live"" and increasingly I feel as if I'm perhaps a social outcast in the peer groups I'm in (though also I'm sure most of the FIRE community feels this way), I still spend time to do things I enjoy. I've been to 27 countries, I've immigrated around to different countries as one of my hobbies is passport collection which has pushed me over $1,000/month in 2 months since 2023 (though I've quickly been sure to budget down from $1,000/month the next few months after that). I do definitely have stress, but who wouldn't working 100 hour weeks and having very little socialization? I'm trying my best to still have a life while working, and I do alright as I tend to work at a coffee shop or outside and talk with people when they approach me (pro tip I guess for still being productive while being a social person) - and that helps my productivity but I can't help feeling like I'm extremely weird and perhaps losing a lot of the understanding of social norms I once had. I also definitely am quicker to become angry with particularly my parents when the topic of money does come up as they were the ones who taught me to live frugally, but I guess that's just being a Jew for you. Prying.

Any advice you all could grant me would be massively appreciated.

1is12mn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1is12mn/cant_let_go/,Can't Let Go,"I met this guy on Tinder a year ago. We had coffee for the first date and I didn't really feel any connection. However, a few days later he texted me and asked me out again. Since he lived less than 10 minutes from me, we spent a lot of time together over the next few months and I started falling hard for him. On our second date he mentioned possibly moving from Atlanta to LA for his work, but made it seem like it was unlikely. We'll after a nice night together, the next morning he told me he was moving in less than a month. I was shattered inside, but played it off that I understood he had to do what's best for him professionally. While he was in Atlanta he never liked to call what we were doing dating, but just ""having fun"" since he isn't really the relationship type. In fact, his last relationship was a decade ago. However, I felt like we were growing closer and closer. Fast forward, he slept at my place the day before his flight and I drove him to the airport. My head told me I couldn't do the long distance thing and to just let him go, but my heart said otherwise. I've visited him every few months since May 2024 and usually stay 4 days.  We've talked about what this ""situationship"" is and he just basically sees it as FWB, but he cares for me. He doesn't want to be official and openly admits to hooking up and frequently at that. He says he feels I'm getting emotionally dependent in him and truthfully I am. I've tried to see other people, but I can't let this guy go. It hurts so much. I feel like I'm just living for that next flight to vist him. I know he doesn't want anything more serious and that I deserve better, but I can't see my life without him. I know it's toxic.

We are the youngest in the building where we work and naturally became friends because of this and started hanging out regularly outside of work. 

In december my husband attacked me. Not trying to go into details but I thought I was going to die. When I called her crying she went off on me. Telling me how she told me to leave him before, how this isn’t good for my daughter and how i’m setting a bad example for her. She understands my situation and knows I can’t just leave with my daughter, I have no access to my money, no family to turn to- it’s just a very hard situation and I have been slowly putting away unnoticeable amounts of money and hoping things go well when I leave in 5 months. 

Sitting there in the hospital, alone, it really got me thinking about how one sided our friendship has been. She is always talking about how she’s a healer, and always attracts broken people and is always “fixing them.” 

She met a man in the summer, and he slapped her, I told her to block his number and she continues to see him and I have always been a safe space for her after she chose to stay. She asked me once after the incident if I was “okay.” She also just got her own apartment(not saying she’s obligated to invite me to stay, but to get so mad- knowing I’d have nowhere for me and my daughter who she calls her niece to go.) 

If i’m wearing a nice outfit, she won’t compliment me but will say something like “Why did wear those shoes with that outfit” Never just a straight up, “you look nice today.” 

I have bought her lunch and brought her coffee at least once a month- she has not offered to buy or bring me anything but will do for other people on her floor. 

You get the picture. 

This past january I made a resolution to myself to stop being such a push over. I stopped greeting her with enthusiasm like she does me, I brought in donuts for my floor and did not text her to come get one, when she started venting about her relationship I asked her why she was still with him when she’s known him less than a year and has 0 ties. I started answering her texts with reacts, not laughing at her jokes when I didn’t find them funny. She texted me yesterday asking if I was okay because I seemed weird. 

These seem like such petty things, and they are. I’m being petty and probably immature, but i’m tired of giving love when it’s never received. I’ve wiped too many tears to be so alone. ",9,1739842495.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

I finally decided to pull the trigger but I’m seeing some advantages of micra: smaller, heat up time and may fit and look better.

The context:

Mini can fit at my counter; I have the space. Right now I have a Profitec Go (single boiler) and a Eureka Libra Grinder. But I think micra would look better.

Routine:

I make one capuccino in the morning and three ocasional shots during the day. Almost never have to do a lot of coffee in a row. 

Price: 

In my county the Micra costs just 1228 more than the Mini, but it’s still 1.2k more.

I like the timer at the Mini and I’m used to it at my Profitec. I don’t care too much about pre infusion. Can’t decide. Micra can save me some money and space; Mini was an old dream.

Say I 100% had to repair these. All the time in the world to bend them back in to place. What should I do?  
I took them to a shop today and obviously they said if they pulled on it with their typical tools it would snap. I understand that, they don't have all day to sit and tweak a wheel back in to shape, but i do. So with time on my side, what would you consider reasonable to get these wheels back in to shape? There's not really any replacement part available for these wheels as it's a 2 piece (1 solid barrel + face welded to it)  
Yea maybe they might end up permanently out of balance or a bit wobbly, but i have to at least try. Or if anything at least to make them look presentable and use as decor. They would make for a sweet coffee table at least!

My best friend and I will be sailing on the Valor 9.29-10.4 for my birthday (10.3). We will be embarking in NOLA and our ports are Cozumel and Progresso, Yucatán. It will be our second cruise (both with Carnival), but it’s our first time sailing by ourselves - the first trip was planned out, paid for, etc. by family and friends. We want to make sure we do things correctly to maximize our experience. We sailed last on the Dream in 2015, so I imagine some things have changed. 

Questions we have so far:
1. How do we select a dining time? It shows it has been selected for us, but I don’t know how to see that and wasn’t given an option to select a time when booking.
2. Is the Cheers package worth it? We aren’t big alcohol drinkers, but we do enjoy coffee and soda.
3. Any must-recommend excursions? We are looking at lazy river tubing, cavern swim, and ruins in Progresso (all one excursion) but not really sure what to do in Cozumel.
4. Will there be a formal night on a five-night cruise? From what I’ve read, it seems to be on the second night of the cruise. Just want to be sure that is correct.
5. Anything that we absolutely need to pack? I am already prescribed Scopolamine and Phenergan for nausea for my gastroparesis, but was planning on bringing basic OTCs as well. I know you can’t bring surge protectors, but extension cords are fine?
6. Our last night of the cruise is my birthday. What should we do to live it up? It will be a sea day.

1is0rw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/comments/1is0rw8/my_postbotox_daily_updates/,My Post-Botox Daily Updates,"Hi everyone! I am 5 months post-botox and my life is changed! I wanted to post my notes from right after botox which gave a play by play of my progress as it came. There was a post very similar to this which I read which encouraged me to make a botox appointment and I want to do the same for others who are scared/nervous to start the process. 

July 2024: Decided I was going to start the process of getting botox. Im in Georgia and I read on this sub about Emory having an ENT that would do the procedure. I did some research on this doctor (Dr. Andrew Tkaczuk, more on him later). I was totally prepared to have to make an appointment with my primary care doctor to get a referral until I realized on Emorys website you can just book an appointment yourself! Had I known this, I may have booked sooner. So PSA: you may be able to book a consult on your own without the embarrassing talk with your primary care doctor. 

  
August 13, 2024: Consult appointment 

My first appointment at Emory. I met Dr. T and his staff and they instantly eased my nerves. His nurse asked me what I was there for and I told her I couldn't burp and she said ""Oh, RCPD! Got it!"" I could not believe that someone on earth was face to face with me and knew was RCPD was. Dr. T was amazing, listened to my concerns, agreed to botox, and explained that he had done hundreds of injections. It was simple and I didn't have to explain myself or justify why I needed it. He talked to me about availability and scheduled a tentative date. (He does all his procedures on Fridays FYI). I left the appointment and instantly started sobbing in the car with tears of joy. I felt weight lifted off my shoulders that after years of horrible symptoms and being told I was crazy that someone finally acknowledged me and RCPD. I know some of you can probably relate to this feeling. 

  
September 15, 2024: Surgery, AKA, the most life changing day of my life

Surgery was like any surgery. Pre-op took forever, early morning driving to the hospital, getting the IV, etc. etc. Obviously its not fun, but don't let this scare you away from the procedure. Bring a book and read to pass the time and just chill. Its part of the process but it was in no way scary. 

Now is where I will insert notes from my first week: 

Day 1: 

* Automatically I could tell something changed when I woke up from surgery (sore/pokey feeling in throat)
* No microburps today and felt totally fine all day! Went out to dinner and no one knew I had surgery that morning. 
* I did not get intubated because they said I was healthy enough to just do oxygen through the nose throughout while under GA. I think that’s why I didn’t have the typical intubation feelings like scratchy throat or nausea. for reference I am 24F and otherwise healthy in terms of past medical history. Maybe ask your doctor about this to avoid anesthesia/intubation symptoms on top of Botox symptoms. The Nasal cannula was super easy. 

  


Day 2: 

* Some gurgles, but significantly less than I normally get after having coffee, which is a major plus!
* Small micro burp after breakfast while talking. It came out of no where while talking and it caught me by such a surprise that I didn’t get a chance to feel what I felt like 
* Able to release some small bubble of air by turning head side to side or sticking chin in and out. No audible sound yet
* Family is anticipating burps but I'm trying to not put pressure on it

  


Day 3: 

* woke up and drank coffee. No painful gurgles (!!!!!) and 10-15 microburps when I tried different neck stretches (stuck my chin out, in, and looked to the right). Felt so great to drink and enjoy a coffee! 
* Microburps between bites during breakfast and lunch. I noticed they came a lot more when I stood up after sitting down? Also when I was laying on the couch and sat up slightly. Sometimes hiccups would turn into microburps too. 
* Tried Gingerale today and I would say it was not a success. Although I was able to microburp like crazy, it wasn’t enough to release air and the gurgles started. Luckily I wasn’t going anywhere so I had nothing to lose and just dealt with the gurgles as usual. (I will admit they were not nearly as loud and painful as prebotox gurgles). 
* Went to yoga and when I came home I had my first deep burp! Still small but actually felt slightly relieving (not just tiny pops of air). I was so happy! Definitely recommend yoga during this time. 
* Still no slow swallow. I’m worried that it’s coming later but since I only got 50 units of Botox maybe I will avoid that? 

  


Day 4: 

* Still no slow swallow, so thats a plus
* Lots of burps when drinking a Gingerale! 
* Some difficulty getting air out when going on my walk when I wasn't totally ""focussed"" (relaxed, closing my eyes, feeling sensations, adjusting neck posture). Definitely too afraid to go on a run at this point because exercise seems to feel like I have burps getting caught. 
* Burps are starting to taste weird
* Every gurgle turns into a small burp at the top of the gurgle

  


Day 5:

* Giant burps after carbonation and meals and some even feel satisfying! I legitimately felt air deflating from my stomach 
* Some hyper salivation starting...
* Slow swallow at dinner time which basically felt like throat tightening and needing to double swallow to get food down. 

  


Day 6:

* today was the first “rough” day where the hypersalivation caused a lot of gurgles
* Giant gurgles, some of which turned into burps 
* Some slow swallow kicked in during meals. Had to eat very slowly and take sips between bites. I probably didn’t eat as much as I normally would because of this. Don't overthink it. Just take small bites and eat slow. watch TV during meals to distract yourself because if you let it weird you out the throat tightening can be a little scary. 
* Overall the amount of swallowing from the hypersalivation caused some nausea, but I pushed through and kept practicing every time I felt a burp coming on to make sure I didn’t lose it (refused to lay down  and let the burps come despite nausea)

  


Day 7 (1 week post botox): 

* Slow swallow essentially gone
* Found out that pressing tongue to top of mouth helps for closed mouth burping and making GIANT burps (more like silent air bubbles like what normal burpers do to be discrete)
* today I actually found myself craving carbonation after a meal to help me burp
* It’s still hard to burp at a restaurant when I’m around others (silently or without moving my neck/chin too obviously) 
* Nausea comes in waves but I make myself keep pushing through! Keep up with the carbonation because its all about muscle memory!

  
Month 1-2:

* continued pushing carbonation and practicing at home 
* Some regurgitation of food/liquid happened when I burped with my head tilted down (ex: folding laundry) which I choked on. That was a scary moment for sure. 
* Burping like CRAZY! Probably 100 times a day or more, pretty much every time I swallowed. More than my husband who is a normal burper
* Went to a beer-fest and cried to my mom on the phone about how happy I was. That is an example of an activity which I would not have been able to participate in before or would be in serious pain. I realized how much of life I missed out on before. 



Months 3-4

* Burping about as much as my husband, probably half as much as before which is a plus!
* Learned how to burp more discretely
* No more regurgitation
* Occasionally had days/moments that I was particularly anxious (job interview) where I lost my ability to burp (gurgles came back). I obviously PANICKED. I thought many times ""this is the day it ends"" but it always came back! Often times the moments where I was nervous/anxious and lost the ability to burp once I got home and could relax I would burp like crazy. So if this happens to you, don't lose hope! It's probably just anxiety. 

  
Overall Tip:

\- Push through the disgusting burps in the beginning, because at first they really are gross and may remind you of throwing up. But if you don't use it, you will lose it. There were times where I was nauseous after dinner and would just want to lay down flat and avoid burping, but I forced myself every night to sit upright and drink carbonation and let the burps come, regurgitation and all, because I was determined to only have the procedure once. Emetophobia is really powerful over our minds, but my determination to have a normal life outweighed it and I am so thankful it did!

Fence/garden ideas and cat problems,"I need suggestions for fence/garden ideas. I have completely neglected my backyard for a few years for several reasons but I want to redo it. We have a major cat problem, my nextdoor neighbor has around 10+ cats and they keep breeding, they keep crapping in my yard. I've tried citrus peels, coffee grounds, cayenne, motion sensor sprinklers, nothing works and my neighbor won't do anything about it. My main problem with the cats is my dogs LOVE to eat their poop. The cats are not taken care of, my neighbor just feeds them so I'm afraid my dogs may get sick.

So my idea is along the east side of my property along the concrete wall I would like to do ""raised garden bed"" along the fence which I added a picture of. High enough so my dogs can't jump on it to reach cat poop. I would also like to cut down how much grass there is to give the cats less space to poop and it is more noticeable for me to clean up. The problem is the wood fence on the south side of my property my husband said we cant do a ""retainer wall"" or ""raised garden bed"" in that side of the property because it is a wood fence and we are above my south neighbor. Please send any ideas my way. I'm tired of my backyard looking like crap and being full of cat crap.

Recently, their services have been terrible.  I purchased Economy seats + Comfort package which includes food, drinks, and checked bags.  All in, just under $700 RT.  Previously, on international flights, the drinks were unlimited.  Which makes sense, you have a cabin full of people you want to keep happy for 10+ hours.  This last trip, they gave ONE complementary drink and it was during the meal.  Again, I paid for the package that included drinks.  I asked for a coffee, they wanted to charge.  Level has resorted to nickel-and-diming so hard, I don't think I'll fly with them again.

I usually woke up before her to start the coffee maker, moving quietly in the dark as if that would soften my presence. I knew she was waiting for me to wake her, and I loved being the first part of her day. It meant everything to me that she always wanted to begin her mornings in my arms.

We’d stand in the kitchen, the lights still off, watching the sun rise as we talked—sometimes softly, sometimes about nothing in particular—right up until the last seconds before I had to leave for work. The thought of continuing those conversations carried me through the monotony of my day, right until I pulled back into the driveway. I’d switch off my headlights, just in case she’d fallen asleep on the couch waiting for me to come home.

When I came through the door, she would greet me with a warm embrace and eventually offer dinner in a Tupperware container, making sure I ate. We would continue talking throughout the night, recapping our days, discussing friends, family, co-workers, and anything we had seen online recently. She always listened to me, and I did the same for her—at least, I hope I was as good a listener as she was.

I never felt fulfilled in my job, and I often found myself drifting into stressful topics that led to moments of silent dismay. I tried not to let it bother me too much. I always wanted children with her, but I felt we needed to build up our savings a bit more first. Although our new house was small, I dreamed of adding an extension to create more space for a family, especially since we had enough land to make it possible. At times, I felt responsible for our challenges, as if she deserved better than the difficulties we faced.

To counter these feelings, I would put on her favorite childhood show, *The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh*. She would light up whenever we watched it, and its wholesomeness always cheered me up too. Many nights, we would fall asleep with it playing in the background, only to wake up and repeat our routine the next day.

One day, when I came home from work and opened the door, she was standing there with a look I recognized immediately.

Looking down at the floor, as if afraid I might say no, she asked, “Can we get a dog?”

As much as I wanted to say, “Who’s going to walk it? And clean up after it?” I knew she had me, and I would do anything she wanted. She worked from home, and we didn’t have any pets. I had a feeling this was going to come up sooner or later.

The next couple of nights were spent researching breeds and local shelters, and it was so much fun. We reminisced about childhood pets, shared our fond memories with them, and discussed what we should be cautious of as we embarked on this venture. It felt like we were little kids who couldn’t sleep the night before Christmas.

We visited a few shelters, and it seemed like she was on the verge of tears because we couldn’t take home every animal we saw. Most of the dogs weren’t quite what we were looking for, but we kept searching. After visiting our third shelter, we found her. She was lying in her kennel with a polite, matter-of-fact demeanor, as if we were intruding on her tiny space—her home, however small it was. She had a blue merle coat, and according to the kennel employee, she was a rough collie and Labrador mix, about a year and a half old. She immediately stood up to greet my wife when she offered her scent, gently licking her hand. She was so sweet. The only problem was that we were short on time due to prior plans. We had only intended to visit, and if we found a dog, we planned to arrange the adoption for the weekend.

But this was different. Despite all our “research,” we decided to take a chance, canceled our plans, and brought her home. When we pulled into the driveway and parked, she was hesitant to leave her kennel. We had to carry it into our little living room, open the door, and eventually, she cautiously made her way out into the kitchen, where my wife had placed a small bowl of food for her. By the end of the night, she was lying on the floor of our bedroom upstairs. She felt safe with us, and we felt safe with her.

The next day was a Friday, and fortunately for both of us, we had the day off. The morning started out normally, except I had a little helper who made sure my once-silent routine was now loudly observed. I took her out into our large yard, and I had never seen anything happier. She had so much space to explore and looked so curious and free. Every plant and bug was a new discovery as we soaked in the cool late-summer morning. Once she had finished her business, the late riser was waiting for us in the kitchen with her coffee. Our new guest felt much more comfortable, and we were both excited to welcome her into our lives.

After a short game of fetch, my wife grabbed the car keys and excitedly said she wanted to run out to get some treats and a couple more toys. I laughed and took on the babysitter role as she waved to us while backing down the driveway.

An hour passed, and I began to feel a little concerned, but I figured she might have stopped to pick up breakfast. After two hours had gone by with no word from her, I had already called and texted. When three or four hours had passed, I was calling her every minute. The calls went straight to voicemail. As the sun began to set, I sat on the front porch, staring down the driveway, waiting for any sign of headlights. I called my sister, but she lived an hour away and had to work. She told me she would come by as soon as she got off. Our little guest was just happy to be able to run around and get some attention, which greatly helped in the midst of our growing concern.

When I first saw the headlights coming down our driveway, I shot up and jumped down the steps. I had never felt such a rush of relief. The weight of fear had been like a barbell strapped to my back, impossible to lift.

But as the car turned, I noticed the lights on top. It was black and white, and a surge of anger and embarrassment flooded me. The back of my neck burned white-hot. I couldn’t comprehend why this was happening. All she had done was go to the store.

Two state troopers pulled up next to me, their car coming to a quiet stop. They stepped out in unison, their movements precise and deliberate. The passenger-side trooper didn’t say a word as he approached. Gently, he placed an arm around my shoulders, steadying me as I knelt in the yard. His voice was soft, almost a whisper, as he asked, “Can we go inside?”

I still remember the faint glint of their name tags catching the light, momentarily piercing through my hollow stare. One read Murphy, the other Lancaster.

As she was merging onto a highway, a drunk driver, speeding and switching lanes recklessly, hit her. The impact knocked her off the shoulder of the road and into a tree. She died on impact.

My sister arrived at the house shortly after. One of the troopers gently took her outside to break the news, while the other stayed with me in the front room. They remained until she could compose herself, then left their contact information with her before returning to their duties.

Meanwhile, I hadn’t moved from the chair in the living room. I couldn’t move, and I didn’t want to. My sister draped a blanket around me and refused to leave my side. I wept and occasionally vomited into a bucket she had placed next to me. I neither ate nor slept that night. My sister lit candles in the living room, surrounding me in their glow, and tried to coax our little friend out from her hiding spot under our bed upstairs to feed her.

I still remember the darkness of that night. It should have poured rain, but instead, it was a warm, still evening. The silence was suffocating. The candles’ flames danced in my eyes whenever I chose to open them. The only sound came from my sister, who had fallen asleep on the couch next to me. Her somber snoring broke the stillness, a stark contrast to the silent despair that kept me wide awake.

As the sun began to rise, casting a gentle light through the windows like a tranquil alarm, fatigue finally began to overtake me. My heavy eyes started to close, pulling me into what felt like a new nightmare. But then, I felt a wet sensation on my hand, which hung limply over the arm of the chair.

I sat up slightly, rubbed the gunk from my eyes, and leaned over to see our little guest. And it all started over again—not the weeping of loss, but the ache of what could have been and what would always stay with me. She had her tennis ball with her, and it felt as though she was saying, “I’m still here.”

That’s when I chose her name. I wanted her to share in the love I had for the one person I had always wanted to spend every second with. That’s when I named her Bonnie.

# Entry Two

My mornings were no longer silent. Bonnie had grown accustomed to being fed at a specific time, and she made sure I knew it. It felt like she practically dragged me out of bed and into the kitchen. My once quiet, careful morning routine had turned into a laid-back shuffle to serve her beloved breakfast, always followed by a little conversation between us. Sometimes, it feels like she knows she's the reason I get up each morning, keeping me going when I otherwise wouldn't.

Our morning walks around the property have become the only reason I leave the house. After my workplace found out what happened, they put me on leave to sort things out. It was a kind gesture, but honestly, I don't have any desire to go back. Everything I did for that job was for a greater purpose, and now that purpose is gone. I'll find something different when the time comes.

My sister calls frequently and visits often, usually staying more than one night. Her presence has become familiar, and it shows with Bonnie. She joins us on our walks, which is refreshing, even if it doesn't fix everything. I know she cares, but I also know nothing can really make it better.

When she stays over, she usually gets up before me to give me a little more time to stay in bed. She tends to overfeed Bonnie and play with her in a patronizing way. I can tell Bonnie isn't a fan, but I suppose the company is appreciated. Still, every night I see ghosts, and I can't shake the feeling of hearing her voice calling for me down the hall. It taunts me, reminding me of a wound that will never heal.

One evening, after dinner, I took Bonnie for her usual walk. Normally, we stay within view of the house, but I decided to go a little farther into the woods. I figured it couldn’t hurt as long as I remembered the way back. Bonnie led the way, per usual, and we made our way through some tall grass onto a rough dirt path shaded by the tree line. We heard a rustling sound nearby, and I assumed it was a squirrel or a rabbit. The silence that followed was deafening, but when the crickets started chirping again, we continued onward. The shadows cast by the trees made me think about returning during the day to escape the heat and harsh sunlight.

As we moved deeper, the rustling returned, this time closer. Bonnie stopped, and so did I. She sensed something was nearby but didn’t bark. Instead, she backed up toward me, her tail brushing against my legs. The crickets resumed, but Bonnie stayed still.

A coyote burst out of the bushes, startling both of us. Bonnie barked but didn’t advance. The coyote stood its ground, glaring at us, even taking a few steps forward. Fear crept in. What if there were more? What if they went after Bonnie? I quickly leashed her and retreated back towards the house.

Once we got home, I felt a little embarrassed by the encounter, though I’m not sure why. Bonnie seemed fine, so to lift her spirits, I decided to play with her for a while. She always told me that fetch was her favorite game, though she’s shown me a few others. I knew we had to get some playtime in before my sister came and insisted we go to bed. I hate when she gets in between us.

# Entry Three

My sister has pretty much made herself at home, settling into our old living room. I guess it’s fine, but every time I get a moment alone with Bonnie, our time is interrupted by a phone call—from guess who. She usually comes over on Wednesdays and stays until Sunday morning. Having someone around can be nice, but I can tell Bonnie’s starting to get tired of her, and honestly, so am I. She’s just always there. And while I’m grateful for her help, I’m also looking forward to when she gives me some space.

I’ve connected with Bonnie in a way my sister wouldn’t understand. I don’t think she needs to be here all the time. I’m doing a little better, but my sister keeps insisting something’s still wrong. She always says, *""I just don’t want anything else to happen, as long as I can help it.""* Everything is fine. The fact that she doesn’t believe me only makes me more upset. I’m tired of being treated like a child.

Our morning walks have become my only escape from her constant presence. I still think about returning to that shaded area in the woods where the trees block out the light, but I’m not sure I’m ready yet. My sister usually watches us from the kitchen window—I can always feel her there, like a shadow. Still, I’m glad I’m getting out of bed more often than before.

Recently, after one of our morning walks, my sister excitedly told me about a local dog park she wanted to take me to. I wasn’t thrilled about the idea. I don’t trust other people’s dogs around Bonnie, but she was insistent. She really wanted me to leave the house—it’s been a while since I have, and she’s been the one bringing in groceries while I spend most nights lost in thought.

Apparently, my reluctance was obvious, because she gave me an ultimatum: if I went to the dog park, she’d leave me alone for the rest of the week, at least until Sunday. If I didn’t, she’d come back on Thursday. I knew she was trying to be considerate, so I figured, why not?

It was a short drive across town. I sat next to Bonnie in the back seat, trying to keep her calm because of my sister’s erratic driving. I could tell she was stressed, but I knew this wouldn’t take long, and we could get back to our routine.

We pulled into a small parking lot next to the dog park. It wasn’t too bad—small, but luckily not crowded. I kept Bonnie leashed; I didn’t want her getting too close to anyone’s dog. Most people were leaning against the fence near the parking lot, barely paying attention to their dogs, while a few were playing in a small area. My sister rubbed my back, making me jump. She offered to walk Bonnie, but I refused to give up the leash.

A bright yellow tennis ball landed at my feet, and just as I reached down to pick it up, Bonnie grabbed it. I laughed and tried to take it from her mouth when I noticed a pretty Saluki dog standing in front of us, curiously sniffing Bonnie. They exchanged sniffs under my watchful eye, and I kept a firm grip on the leash, ready to pull Bonnie away if anything went wrong. Just then, someone called out,

*""Winnie!""*

When I looked up, I froze. A woman with shoulder-length strawberry-blonde hair was walking toward us. She wore round, wire-frame glasses, and her bright blue eyes met mine as she smiled. Her cheeks flushed slightly, and she brushed her hair back before pointing at the leash.

*""You don’t have to leash them inside the gates,""* she said. *""I understand though! You never know how these things will go. What’s her name?""*

I could hardly speak, but luckily, my sister chimed in. She told her Bonnie’s name and complimented her dog for being “cute and fluffy.” Then, doing me a favor, she said she had left something in the car, adding, *“Take care of my brother while I’m gone.”*

Her name was Amy, and she worked as a dental assistant in town. She had a special fondness for long walks with her dog, whose name was inspired by a favorite childhood character.

Before I knew it, I found out she was free this Saturday. I don’t know why, but I’m excited, even though I feel like I shouldn’t be. When I told my sister, she almost jumped out of the driver’s seat in excitement. She even promised to babysit Bonnie. I just hope she treats Bonnie well while I’m gone.

# Entry Four

When I finally had some time to myself, I started to think more about what I had gotten myself into. I’m not ready to go on a date with anyone right now. I just thought it would be nice to spend time with someone besides my sister for a change.

I haven’t been this nervous in a long time, and I wasn’t sure I was ready for something like this. It felt too soon. I figured I’d let a few days pass and maybe come up with an excuse to get out of it.

Even after some time, I couldn’t shake the feeling that what I was doing was wrong. I still felt like I was making a mistake. I didn’t know what to do until my sister called me on Wednesday. As much as she annoys me sometimes, she knows how to calm me down. She reminded me that this didn’t have to be anything serious if I didn’t want it to be, and I shouldn’t feel bad about being attracted to someone. She even extended the time before she’d check in on me again, which made me feel better. Honestly, I just wanted to get through it and return to spending time with Bonnie.

As the week went on, I just felt worse. I almost came up with an excuse—like pretending I was sick or saying something came up with my family—but I knew if I went through with it, it wouldn’t be so bad, and I’d finally get the space I needed. I checked in with Amy the day before, and she seemed excited. Up until then, our communication had been light—just a few funny exchanges about dog memes.

I barely slept the night before, but not for the usual reasons. My sister came over a couple of hours early, and I guess she helped lift my mood a little. It felt like I was gearing up for something big, like I was supposed to win some kind of race.

She helped with the dishes while I got dressed. Bonnie helped me pick out a nice shirt, which gave me a little confidence—I could feel her cheering me on. But the guilt hit me hard when I realized I was about to leave her behind. I couldn’t shake the feeling that my sister wouldn’t take good care of her. I should’ve just come up with an excuse.

When it was time to leave, it felt like I was saying goodbye for good. I backed out of the driveway, waving to my sister and Bonnie. I could see the sadness in Bonnie’s eyes—she didn’t even come to the car. I kept telling myself it would all be over soon.

Amy and I had agreed to meet at a coffee shop and then take a walk in a nearby park. Before I had decided to have a fit, it seemed like a good idea to get to know her better. Now, I regretted it. Still, I felt the need to show up early so I wouldn’t keep her waiting—it seemed like the right thing to do.

I found a table in the corner, feeling out of place as other people worked on their laptops or met with friends. It was the waiting that was the hardest part, like I was an outsider looking in. The quiet hum of conversations around me broke when she finally walked through the door.

She was dressed nicely, with her makeup done and her hair styled. Instinctively, I sat up straighter and checked my breath. I don’t know why I hadn’t eaten anything yet. She spotted me and came over for an awkward side-hug before sitting down. I offered to get her a drink while she got settled. She politely declined at first, but I insisted.

She asked for a cappuccino, and since I only drink coffee at home, I panicked and ordered the same thing. I admitted I didn’t know much about coffee, and she laughed. We talked about small things: where we went to school, childhood interests, favorite movies or shows.

It felt good to have a normal conversation, even though I hadn’t really watched much since everything happened with Bonnie. Amy told me she got Winnie during a tough time in her life too. I didn’t go into detail about what happened to me—I just called it a *""tough time.""* But when I mentioned how important Bonnie was to me, I started choking up. I excused myself to the bathroom, but I’m pretty sure she noticed.

When I came back, she placed her hand on mine and said, *“Pets are family, but they always feel like good friends at first.”* It made me feel a little better, but she didn’t really understand how much Bonnie means to me. Honestly, her comment felt like a bit of a reach.

We kept talking about Bonnie and Winnie. She shared her favorite games to play with Winnie, and I mentioned a few of mine, but she didn’t seem that interested. I noticed her looking away and making odd expressions as I spoke. I wasn’t sure why. I hadn’t reacted that way when she was talking.

She quickly changed the subject to the weather, and we decided to head to the park for a walk. It was a beautiful fall afternoon—golden leaves, bright sunshine, and a gentle breeze. The summer humidity was gone, making the day feel perfect. I was even more excited because I knew I was closer to going home to Bonnie.

As we walked, Amy talked about how fascinating she found the connection between dogs and humans. She thought it was strange how dogs follow and rely on humans through a leader-follower relationship. In the wild, there isn’t an alpha dog—they hunt and live in packs as a family unit.

That idea stuck with me. I told her how I used to really want a family, how important it was to me at one point. It felt like something I had held close but then lost. I wasn’t sure anymore if it was something I still wanted.

We walked around the park a couple of times, sharing funny family stories and laughing together. Time slipped by, and before I knew it, the sun was setting. I felt like I was almost at the finish line. She mentioned needing to check on Winnie and said she’d text me later. We said our goodbyes, and I walked to my car, feeling lighter.

On the drive home, I could feel the pressure on the accelerator—I couldn’t wait to see Bonnie and tell my sister how it went. As soon as I pulled up, Bonnie ran out to greet me saying *“Please don’t leave again!”* I told my sister about the date, and she hugged me so tightly it felt like she was squeezing all the tension out of me. She said she was proud of me, but had to head home soon, though Bonnie still needed to go out. In that moment, I couldn’t have been happier.

I grabbed Bonnie’s leash, and we waved goodbye from the porch as we rounded the house, heading toward the field where the trees covered the sky. I felt unstoppable. It was a full moon that night, and I wanted to see the moonlight spill through the canopy as we listened to the crickets and watched the fireflies flicker in the dark.

But when we reached the tree-covered area, the crickets had fallen silent, and the fireflies seemed too shy to show themselves. It was a bit disappointing. I hadn’t expected much, but I had hoped for more. The night was still beautiful, though—clouds had rolled in, making it darker than I’d imagined.

As we stood there, I felt a strange silence settle over us. It felt familiar in a way I couldn’t quite place. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up, and a sense of discomfort filled the air. There was this unshakable feeling of danger, like something was watching us.

Bonnie’s fur bristled, and she positioned herself in front of me, feet wide apart, alert and protective. I sensed something too, and just like before, the bushes across from us rustled. This time, a coyote burst out—but not in the cautious way it had before. It leapt at us with aggression, baring its fangs. Bonnie, usually so brave, tucked her tail and retreated behind me.

Without thinking, I scooped her up, adrenaline fueling my strength, and ran back toward the house as fast as I could, fear propelling me forward.

When we got back to the house, Bonnie hid under the kitchen table for most of the night and when I went to sleep she slept underneath the bed. I was humiliated. I don’t know why I thought anything good could have come from going back there. I don’t know why I couldn’t have protected her when it counted. I know that I will never allow that to happen again. I know that I have learned what was needed to protect our family.

# Entry Five

Good morning, Dr. Meier,

It has been quite some time since we last spoke, and I wanted to reach out to express my concerns about my brother, Nick. I deeply respect the importance of client confidentiality in supporting his healing, but I am genuinely worried about his well-being.

After Nick lost Bonnie, I may have been too involved in trying to support him. It felt strange when he named their newly adopted dog ""Bonnie"" so soon after her passing. I understood his desire to preserve her memory, but it seemed like an unfair burden to place on another animal that couldn’t understand its significance.

I gently suggested other names, but Nick was adamant about naming her Bonnie. At first, it seemed to help him cope, especially during times when I couldn’t be there. Knowing that this new Bonnie gave him a reason to get outside offered some reassurance, as I feared he might otherwise retreat entirely.

I know I can be pushy, but I felt compelled to encourage him to leave the house and stay active. I worried about him isolating himself and feared the worst. I just wanted to help him in any way I could.

When Nick met Amy, I was thrilled. Seeing him connect with someone on a personal level gave me hope. It was a relief to know he had someone else besides me to lean on.

However, I’ve grown increasingly worried about his attachment to the new Bonnie. He seems overly protective of her and dislikes when I interact with her in ways he doesn’t approve of, which happens often. He claims to know her “favorite games” but never explains them. I’ve overheard him having long, detailed conversations with her, but he goes silent the moment he realizes I’m nearby. It often feels like he’s discussing something about me with her.

Recently, I witnessed something concerning. Through the kitchen window, I saw him walking Bonnie. He let her off the leash, then sat on the ground in a posture mimicking a dog. Suddenly, he sprinted across the yard on all fours, chasing her. As strange as it sounds, he was surprisingly fast, almost catching up to her.

When I visited him recently, something felt very off. Normally, he greets me at the front porch, but this time, he didn’t. I waited, then checked the front door, which was unlocked. Inside, the house was in disarray—uncleaned and foul-smelling, like urine. After calling for him multiple times, he entered through the front door with Bonnie following. Her fur was unkempt, and she desperately needed a bath. Nick looked similarly disheveled—his clothes were dirty, and he clearly hadn’t shaved in some time.

I tried to talk to him, but he ignored me, focusing on feeding Bonnie by pouring food directly on the floor. I attempted to clean up a bit, preparing to mop the floors at least, but he angrily dumped the bucket of water outside, saying Bonnie would get upset if I cleaned. He told me to leave it alone, so I played along, sensing he wasn’t in the right state of mind.

We sat in the living room—me on an unstained ottoman and him in a filthy chair. I tried making conversation, hoping he’d share something about what was going on, but he wouldn’t budge. He eventually told me he didn’t need me checking on him anymore. He said he was fine and didn’t need “babysitting.”

His dismissal upset me, and I admit I reacted emotionally. I demanded to know what was going on, saying I couldn’t bear to lose him after already losing a sister-in-law. This triggered an angry outburst. He began yelling, clenching his fists—behavior I’m familiar with as his sibling—but something about his cadence felt off.

When Nick stood up to leave the room, I hoped he might calm down. Instead, Bonnie began barking, mirroring his agitation. She bared her teeth and, without warning, lunged at me. Nick grabbed her just in time, making it clear that I needed to leave immediately.

I don’t want to get my brother or Bonnie into trouble, but I believe it’s time to reach out to him and encourage him to speak with you. Please let me know if you hear from him.

Thank you,  
Millie Robertson

# Entry Six

Good Morning,

As a precautionary measure before notifying local authorities for a welfare check on Mr. Nick Robertson, I am submitting the following entry from our journaling system, which is required for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder.

I have been working with Mr. Robertson to navigate the grieving process, but I am concerned that I have not been successful in helping him fully process his recent traumatic experiences or rebuild trust within his immediate family.

Please review the attached journal entry and ensure it is placed into records accessible to the police, should the need arise.

Thank you,  
Dr. Meier

I have found true happiness living with Bonnie and our family. Together, we have claimed this land, and with time, our numbers will grow. Bonnie has shown me my true purpose, and I will never allow anything—or anyone—to stand in the way of that. I’ve proven my loyalty to Bonnie time and time again as we’ve ventured to the farthest reaches of our home.

The forest, where the trees weave their shadows, belongs to us now. When the coyote appeared, I made my presence known. It challenged me, but I responded with a message that its kind will never forget. They now know their place, and some have even fallen in line, following me with a loyalty you could never understand. I lead them, and they obey—unlike you.

I am more complete than I’ve ever been. The past means nothing. The only thing that matters is what I have now, and I have everything I need. I don’t need you, and I never did. You were supposed to help me, but all I ever saw was your selfishness, your hollow attempts to justify your work. You don’t care about me. You only care about your job, about pretending to help people. But you don’t. You never did.

I know you’ll send others after us once you read this. We will endure no matter what. This land—our land—has outgrown its boundaries, and now our home stretches far beyond where you think it ends. We will thrive, and you will wither. Your weakness has always been your downfall.

# Entry Seven

**Martinsburgh Police Department Report**  
**Case Number:** 078221  
**Date:** 11/17/2026

On November 14th, 2025, at approximately 1530 hours, I was dispatched to (STREET ADDRESS REDACTED FOR PRIVACY) for a welfare check on the occupant, Nicholas ROBERTSON. Upon arrival, OFC LANCASTER and I met with Millie L. ROBERTSON, who was waiting for us outside the residence.

We spoke with Ms. ROBERTSON briefly to understand the situation involving Mr. ROBERTSON. After our conversation, we approached the front door of the residence. Attempting to look through the windows on the front porch proved ineffective due to heavy dirt and grime obscuring the glass.

We knocked on the door, announcing our presence, but received no response. Ms. ROBERTSON attempted to open the door, which was unlocked. As she did, we heard a disturbance around the side of the house. Moments later, approximately twenty dogs came running into view. The dogs were barking aggressively and behaving erratically. OFC LANCASTER and I retreated from the porch to call for backup and animal control. Although the dogs were difficult to manage, none of them bit anyone on the scene.

Once backup officers arrived, efforts were made to distract and corral the dogs, allowing us to safely re-approach the house. Upon opening the front door, we were met by an additional dozen dogs rushing out of the home. The scene inside was chaotic and unsanitary, with dried dirt and feces covering the walls and floors as well as unknown animal remains scattered throughout. The home appeared to be in complete disrepair.

Ms. ROBERTSON became visibly upset and began calling out for her brother while moving through the home. Despite our attempts to keep her outside to ensure her safety, she insisted on searching for him. She eventually ran upstairs, where we followed to remove her from the premises for further investigation.

The upstairs bedroom was in slightly better condition than the rest of the house. While securing the area and escorting Ms. ROBERTSON outside, OFC LANCASTER observed a large torn-apart box on the bedroom floor. Printed on the side of the box was the name “Novatek.”

OFC LANCASTER conducted a quick search on his phone to learn more about Novatek. The results revealed an article about a Japanese man who had gained widespread attention for commissioning an incredibly lifelike dog costume from the company. The photos accompanying the article showed a costume so detailed it was nearly impossible to distinguish it from a real animal, complete with synthetic fur, anatomically accurate features, and lifelike movements. OFC LANCASTER shared this information with me, and it was at this moment we realized that one of the dogs on the premises was likely Mr. ROBERTSON.

OFC LANCASTER and I quickly exited the home and returned to the front yard, where most of the dogs had already escaped containment. They were seen running across the open field behind the house and into a distant tree line. Among the fleeing dogs, one stopped momentarily, stood upright on its hind legs, and then disappeared into the forest.

# Epilogue

Hello Dr. Meier,

I’ve tried reaching out to you through calls and texts as much as I could after everything that happened. First, I want to sincerely apologize for the media fallout following the investigation into my brother’s home. We’re doing our best to restore the property and eventually put it on the market, though it seems like it will be a long time before anyone feels comfortable purchasing it.

That said, I would feel a lot better if I could hear from you. I understand if you’ve been avoiding my attempts to reach out—I wouldn’t blame you. I feel responsible for so much of this and just want to find a way to make things right.

There’s something I need to bring to your attention as well. When I searched my brother’s house the day he disappeared, I found an address written on a piece of paper taped to his old refrigerator. When I looked it up, I discovered it was tied to your name. I hope it’s an old or temporary residence because I don’t believe my brother has any reason to seek you out—or at least, I haven’t seen any signs of hostility toward you. If you’ve experienced anything unusual, please let me know as soon as you can.

I’ve also heard unsettling reports from friends about hunters being attacked by wild dogs in the woods. One story mentioned a creature moving so quickly and violently it didn’t seem like anything they’d ever seen. I’m hoping these are just exaggerated tales. Still, I hear howling in the woods around my home. Some nights it feels louder and closer, like it’s calling out to me—or maybe coming for me. Either way, I know there’s no place for me there anymore.

Please take care,

now here’s the problem. as of last year he has suddenly changed his demeanour entirely. from playing his ps5 way to much and ignoring me, and belittling me and pushing our baby away and not meeting her demands, and ignoring her crying all together. he never does any chores, and never cooks anymore. he always uses the excuse “my stomach is cramping” or “my head hurts” but then go straight back to the video games and eating noodles for the rest of the night while i take care of my baby. 
he has also lately been controlling and abusive towards me. i would post a picture of my face on instagram and he would go into my account and delete it and call me a sl*t and say im trying to get boys attention. or when i wear a low cut dress with a low-ish hemline he says im fishing to get r@ped. he also has all of my social media accounts, and steals my phone all the time and goes through it without my permission. 
i have absolutely nothing to hide, and have no problem with him going through my phone but it’s the fact he never asks to do anything and does it all to get a rise out of me. 

if i don’t answer him when he calls me, he will accuse me of ignoring him/being ignorant (i am 50% deaf). he knows i am deaf and have trouble hearing but he says im being an ignorant bi*ch anyway. he controls who i talk to and who i meet up with. 
i am not allowed to sleep over at my mums with my baby or see her during the night. i have a curfew he has set. i am not allowed to meet up with friends because he doesn’t want to look after our baby because he finds her crying “too loud and irritating”. i am not allowed to express my emotions fairly because i am “snitching” on him, even though i never even mention his name and just say “i am upset, and i want someone to talk to”. if i don’t do what he says, he tells me to k*ll myself and go h@ng myself and that i didn’t deserve to be born or that i am worthless.

he has even gone as far as smashing my phone and my other belongings. i have spent over $2000 on new phones because he keeps on breaking them on me every time he doesn’t get his own way. 

his dad (my FIL) is an absolutely amazing person. he is kind, thoughtful and honest. he cares about my interests and his granddaughter deeply. every single time blake is around his dad, he acts like he’s never done anything wrong in his life. always acting nice and cooking for him and making him coffee and doing good gestures, all the while im sitting with the baby absolutely tired as hell, while he is strutting around while knowing he is a monster behind closed doors. 

blake has even gone as far as choking me because i wouldn’t let him go through my phone (i changed the password and locked the apps). 

am i wrong for wanting to leave him, but feeling bad for leaving his dad because he will be heartbroken? ",8,1739840892.0,abusiverelationships,4,0.91,False

Now, I’m back after having tested the samples.

It’s important to note that, while I initially chose the fragrances based on notes, I make a point of not double-checking when I test, going in as blindly as possible. Now, on to the reviews!

“Azo Gold” – *warm honey amber with woody undertones and notes of rice flour, red champaka, incense & golden caramel*

I tested this freebie first, and it was admittedly hard to pint down. At times it surprised me with its similarities to… “El Baile de los Muertos,” of all perfumes! It seemed to share a top note that I can only describe as “sweet lacquer,” before settling into a comforting spice mélange (much warmer and more inviting than Arakis, though).

Color me absolutely *shocked* when I saw that “honey amber” was a highlighted note, as both honey (usually cloying) and amber (powdery) are notes I stay away from. I think the red champaka/champaca (I’m not sure how it’s spelled at this point) and incense are doing heavy lifting here to ground this and keep it from becoming a pourable sugar fest. If you missed EBdlM, then I genuinely recommend that you check this one out when it’s formally released in March.

Rating: **4**/5 – frankincense, myrrh, and *gold*

“Nag Champa” – *(unpublished; presumably a solinote)*

I dreaded this one, so I figured I test a little bit on my arm to stop being a big baby. The reason? My mom has often burned incense, and I’ve typically enjoyed the smells—but one time, there was something in the smell that was so… sweetly astringent? I don’t know how else to explain it, but it nearly made me sick. My mom checked the variety pack and realized the one she burned was called “nag champa.”

I have stayed away from nag champa ever since.

Luckily, the aroma from this perfume didn’t make me sick; but there is a quality that reminds me of my perceived astringency (I suppose) in sage, another note I dislike. Almost like it’s alcohol without the fun.

If you like nag champa incense, though, I wouldn’t listen to my review. However, I don’t see anywhere on Pulp’s site where this is being sold, or even anticipated, so I’m not sure if this is a one-off or not.

Rating: **2**/5 – yeah… no

“Ballet Arabesque” – *dark rum, dulce de leche, roasted chestnuts, rockrose resin, Moroccan bakhoor, black vanilla bean, spikenard, oakmoss, & coffee CO2*

Coffee! Coffee-coffee-coffee-coffee-COFFFFEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!! AAARRRGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The opening is such an exaggerated coffee scent that it’s almost savory. Forget additives, forget even freshly-brewed—this stuff is *actively percolating!* Eventually some sweetness and some spice (like nutmeg) come forth through the hours this takes to mellow, but this is long-lasting and energizing. Prior to trying this, I would’ve said that CocoaPink “Coffee” was my favorite coffee perfume. I think this one surpassed it.

This is for coffee lovers. This is for the Agent Coopers of the world.

Rating: **5**/5 – “I’ve had I can’t tell you how many cups of coffee in my life, and this… is one of the best.”

“Ghostwood Forest” – *cherry pie from the Double-R Diner, Douglas fir, fresh PacNW forest air, cozy sweaters & coffee as “black as midnight on a moonless night”*

After such a coffee explosion, of course I had to try the actual *Twin Peaks* themed fragrance next! I didn’t remember the notes at all, but going by the name assumed this would be coniferous. Imagine my surprise when it was so… fruity.

I couldn’t immediately discern what the fruit was, though. Grape? Pomegranate? Cranberry? I didn’t think it was cherry, because it lacked an almond nuance that is usually cloying for me (why I avoid cherries in perfume—and marzipan, and anything remotely related to almonds). The fruitiness has immense staying power, lasting for hours and hours, though it eventually takes on a medicinal edge. Medicinal, and vaguely… roasted? Like sticks used for roasting marshmallows, rather than the marshmallows themselves. Like the remnants of the fire at the Packard Mill…

Then I looked at the notes and saw it: cherry pie. Of *course* there was a cherry pie note! I’m impressed it didn’t make me queasy—and further surprised I even bought this (my love for *Twin Peaks* knows no bounds, I guess). The cozy sweaters & coffee are coming together to singe the wood notes, definitely. More and more, this one is growing on me.

Rating: **4**/5 – “He met the devil. The devil took the form of fire. Fire is the devil hiding like a coward in the smoke.”

“Casting the Runes” – *hot toddies around a roaring bonfire, rum-spiked nog, cardamom, nutmeg & hot cocoa*

When I opened the vial, I was absolutely, positively, completely *unprepared* for how sweet it was. It hit like an icing avalanche, making me lean back to avoid the aroma. Probably the “sweetest” fragrance I own is a sample of Solstice Scents “Owl Creek Aleworks” (the opening toffee is starting to be a little much for me, so I’m not planning to FS it), and the opening of “Casting the Runes” batted that one out of the park.

I started to wonder why I had actually purchased this one. Surely if I’d thought it would be this cloying, I wouldn’t have even chosen it, right? Fortunately, on skin the sweetness mellows eventually into… something vaguely spicy and resinous. But it’s quiet. Almost unbelievably so, compared to the opening. It’s like a sugared extinction burst, wasting all its energy in the opening—I was left kind of bummed in the end, to be honest. And wishing I was wearing “Ballet Arabesque,” instead.

Rating: **2**/5 – spontaneous sugar dump in the ocean

“Ensnare” – *rich dark oud, labdanum, maple sugar sweets, and a line of black salt at the door*

And here, with the last sample, is where I found it: the elusive Pulp scrubber. Oh, I had to take this off my skin 30 seconds after applying. It was one of the most burnt, acrid perfumes I’ve ever smelled. Like a wet bonfire. I’ve had “kindling” fragrances before, and they haven’t bothered me as much as this one. There isn’t a speck of sweetness to be had here, the maple candies are completely MIA.

“Labdanum” and “rockrose resin” (“Ballet Arabesque”) are the same thing, from what I understand, and I loved BA. So I don’t think that is the culprit. I also do, in fact, like oud—that doesn’t usually smell like a bonfire on me. Is it the salt? Is that what’s ruining it?

Rating: **0**/5 – expel

And so ends the testing for my Pulp Fragrance order! I had a runaway surprise hit with “Ballet Arabesque,” I didn’t think I’d love it *that* much. And there were a few surprises to be had (including one negative one at the end). But hopefully I’ll be able to find new homes for the ones I’m not keeping… and if you missed the boat for EBdlM, I really do encourage you to check out “Azo Gold” when it releases.",16,1739840241.0,Indiemakeupandmore,2,1.0,False

Hi, I'm feeling overwhelmed and trapped, and I could really use some perspective. 



My relationship with my mum has been difficult, to put it lightly. At the beginning of the year it got to the point where I told her family therapy was the only way I would be open to trying to ""resolve things"". She refused at first, but when I stuck to my boundary on that being the only way I will engage with her, she agreed she would ""if that's what it takes"" & to let her know when & where, but stated she wasn’t happy about it. When I said I needed time to think about it, she replied ""this is what you wanted, and now you need time, I give up!”

I was hesitant as since I initially proposed therapy, her emotional abuse has escalated, & I don't believe she genuinely wants to change, she just wants to regain control. 

Last year, I went low-contact with her, only arranging visits with my brothers and taking them for days out instead of going round. This wasn't sustainable & eventually I resumed visiting them at home, initially not interacting with my mum. I found out my older brother (11) was suicidal, so I fought to get him help because my mum is neglectful, avoidant & was minimizing the situation. This was retraumatizing but I'm glad I was there & advocated for him. That’s when I resumed contact, which she mistook for reconciliation. I guess I went back to pretending everything was ok, albeit more boundaried.

Conflict was reignited at the beginning of the year as she pretended she didn't see my relationship status of my first same sex relationship. She admitted it, making it about how much it hurt finding out publicly. I said I might've told her if she responded better when I came out to her, as she basically asked why I was telling her and said I don't need to go round telling everyone. She denies ever saying that, that I misunderstood, she meant something else, etc. One message she sent was ""I don't give a shit what you are"".

When I next saw my brothers, my eldest brother was telling me that my mum doesn't care that I was with my ex & questioned me in such a way that parrotted my mum & triggered an emotional flashback.

Last week, my grandad told me to meet him for a coffee, which I was correct in thinking would be about my mum. He told me he was only getting involved now as my 11 year old brother has been crying himself to sleep every night over this. Bare in mind I have been parentified & my mum has been using weaponizing my siblings and trying to guilt trip me with them.

The next day my mum messaged me saying ""grandad told me you had a chat. I understand how you feel about the family therapy but obviously neither of us has the spare money to pay for it"" (I told my grandad I expect her to pay half & would get back to her with the fee, as I found a local service with a sliding-scale. I told him I pay for my own therapy but I didn't say I couldn't afford it-not to say that I can, but I would make it work) ""I really want to discuss things with you so we can resolve the situation as I have no idea how you have come to the conclusion that I reacted badly to you coming out. I really do think it's one big misunderstanding we can resolve by talking"" (again, I've explained it's not just one situation I misunderstood that can be ""resolved"" in one conversation, when she can't even have a healthy conversation via text) ""Therefore I was wondering if you would be willing to meet up on your terms. You say the time & place & if you feel more comfortable you are welcome to bring a friend along for support. I really don't want to argue with you, I just want the chance to sort this out."" 

I think that message speaks for itself. The gaslighting has also began to make me question my memory, but I'm trying to remind myself that it's not just about that, it's our entire relationship, the emotional neglect, invalidation, gaslighting, entitlement, contempt.

A couple days later my older brother phoned me up & confided in me that he's upset that me & my mum aren't ""friends"". We were on the phone for half an hour & it consisted of him asking why we fell out, asking to know at least one reason why, saying he needs to know why so he knows why he's crying every night, suggesting we go for a coffee with my mum to try to sort it out, etc. He doesn't take no for an answer & pushes boundaries, which I find incredibly difficult. I hate that he's now parentified. I hate that my mum told them her narrative (which I told her was inappropriate, & she obviously didn't respond well too). I hate that I'm causing the pain. I can't explain how much that conversation broke my heart.

Since my mum messaged, & I had that conversation with my brother, I'm wondering if I should just try to go back to being friendly & pretending everything is fine, as the pain, pushback & pressure I'm causing is unbearable.

I feel powerless and destabilized by her pattern of denial and gaslighting. Every time I seem to stabilize, & my therapy sessions aren't taken over by processing ongoing trauma, something with her knocks me back into the cycle. I’ve lost most of my support system and now only have one close friend and my therapist. 

I feel like I'm at one of the lowest points in my life, it feels like everything is falling apart & it's all my fault, even though I know my needs matter too.

I’ve now started grinding my own coffee beans using a hand me down coffee grinder (nothing too fancy) and i’ve started using the double wall puck (if that’s the right term) and made sure not to leave any gaps for channelling. Yet my coffee pulls so oddly at times. Sometimes it’s all just white. Sometimes when it pours there’s some black, which is momentarily, and then quickly changes to white and the end result is a weak coffee.


I really want to learn to make a good espresso so any advice or suggestions would be really appreciated. What is it that i’m doing wrong?

While these networks offer convenience, they also come with serious security risks. Hackers and cybercriminals often target unsecured public networks to steal personal information, financial details, and sensitive data. Fortunately, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) can protect you from these threats by encrypting your internet connection and keeping your online activities private.

# The Dangers of Public Wi-Fi

Using public Wi-Fi without protection exposes you to several risks, including:

* **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks** – Hackers intercept data between you and the website or service you're accessing.
* **Unencrypted Connections** – Many public Wi-Fi networks lack proper encryption, making it easy for cybercriminals to spy on your online activity.
* **Malware Distribution** – Some public hotspots are infected with malware that can compromise your device.
* **Fake Wi-Fi Networks** – Cybercriminals set up fake networks to trick users into connecting and stealing their data.

# How a VPN Enhances Your Security on Public Wi-Fi

A VPN is one of the best tools to stay safe when using public Wi-Fi. It creates a secure, encrypted tunnel for your internet traffic, preventing hackers and third parties from spying on your online activities. Here’s how a VPN protects you:

# 1. Encrypts Your Internet Traffic

When you connect to public Wi-Fi through a VPN, all your data is encrypted. Even if someone tries to intercept your connection, they won’t be able to read your information. This keeps sensitive details like passwords, banking information, and private messages secure.

# 2. Hides Your IP Address

A VPN masks your real IP address and assigns you a new one, preventing websites, hackers, and even the network provider from tracking your location and online behavior. This anonymity helps keep your personal data safe.

# 3. Protects Against Cyber Threats

Hackers often lurk on public Wi-Fi, looking for vulnerable users. A VPN acts as a shield, blocking unauthorized access and reducing the risk of cyberattacks like phishing and malware infections.

# 4. Allows Secure Access to Work and Personal Accounts

Many businesses require remote employees to use a secure connection when accessing company resources. A VPN ensures safe communication between your device and work servers, keeping confidential business information protected.

# 5. Prevents Data Throttling and Monitoring

Some public Wi-Fi providers track users’ online activities and may even throttle bandwidth for certain services. A VPN prevents this by encrypting your traffic, making it impossible for network providers to see what you're doing online.

# 6. Enables Safe Online Transactions

Shopping or banking on public Wi-Fi without protection is risky. A VPN ensures that your financial transactions remain private and secure, protecting your payment details from cybercriminals.

# Stay Secure Wherever You Go

Public Wi-Fi is convenient, but without the right protection, it can put your sensitive information at risk. By using a VPN, you can browse the internet safely, keep your data private, and avoid cyber threats. Choosing a reliable **VPN service provider** ensures you get the best encryption, security features, and performance, giving you peace of mind every time you connect to a public network.",1,1739839652.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

“Wha-“, I jolted upwards in bed, letting out a gasp that was more like a breath of air being sucked down.

I woke up twenty minutes later than usual. Most days, I’m already out of bed before my alarm even goes off, but today was different—*I was just exhausted*.

“Great,” I groaned, fumbling to silence the alarm that had been blaring for God knows how long.

I dragged myself out of bed, starting my morning ritual—the same routine I’ve followed almost every day for over a decade now: shit, shower, shave, coffee. As I was getting dressed for work, my phone *buzzed* with a text from my supervisor, Trevor.

“*Meet*.”

That was it—just one word, as vague as ever. But I knew better than to expect anything good from it. The last time I’d received one of Trevor’s cryptic “*meet*” messages, it had led to a tirade of a staff meeting about supposed missed deadlines caused by ‘*recent budget cuts’*. He tore into us hard, and the silence afterward was deafening. I’d felt like a failure that day—until Amanda, one of the chief financial officers and a work friend, quietly reassured me that we’d been ahead of schedule.

Still, Trevor’s tirade left a sour taste.  So much so, I stopped trusting him.

As I headed out the door, another text came in—this time from my wife, Brenna:

“*Good morning, sleepyhead! Had to leave early :( Things are crazy at the hospital rn. Thinking of grabbing steak tonight at Billy’s. You in*?”

I smiled at her message; the thought of a date night lifted my spirits. Maybe today won’t be so bad after all.

“*Sounds like a date ;) Good morning to you too. I love you and can’t wait to see you later*,” I replied before starting my car.

As my engine warmed up, I took a sip of my coffee, enjoying the rare sunshine peeking through the grey Midwest sky. The weather around here is usually bleak—overcast skies, freezing temperatures, and constant rain, the usual. But today, the sunshine felt like a gift. With good weather appearing imminent, a steak dinner date tonight, and Brenna’s beautiful face on my mind, I let myself believe.

*Nothing could ruin this, not even Trevor.*

I pulled out of the driveway and heard a *ding* notification ring from my phone. I presumed it was Brenna replying.

The drive to work, as usual, was long and uneventful—thirty-five minutes of alternating between civilization and isolation. The first ten minutes took me through Fredtown, the town in which I resided. The remaining twenty-five minutes were spent on a winding road cutting through the dense wilderness, with nothing but pine trees and silence for company.

Fredtown itself was... ‘*unique*’. The city was dominated by federal employees—military personnel, high-level researchers, and even agents from organizations we couldn’t even begin to guess. Crime here was laughably low too. The common running joke amongst townspeople was that jaywalking could land you in federal prison.

I made my way to the edge of town before continuing onward into the scenic part of my drive. Though beautiful, the forest had an eerie quality, especially at night here. Maybe it was just my nerves, but I always felt like something was watching me the closer I got to work.

As I approached my destination, the forest opened up, revealing the sprawling field that housed the facility. The plant stretched out about a mile or two in radius, a fortress of steel and concrete amidst the trees. I parked in my usual spot several rows back from the electrified fence that guarded this place.

This wasn’t just your *ordinary power grid*—it was the *centerpiece* of our nation’s push for groundbreaking energy solutions. From solar to experimental technologies, it has many of the revolutionary changes that you have seen within the last thirty to forty years. Everything was being developed here under the watchful eye of the Department of Energy. It was my job to oversee research and administration, but even after a decade, I still didn’t fully understand this place.

Sure, I followed orders, studied data, and ran tests they assigned me, but the bigger picture was more complicated than that. My most recent project now, for example, involved designing containment protocols for massive surges of electrical power. On the surface, it seemed practical—preventing equipment damage or accidents from occurring. But when I dug into the specifics, I realized the scale of it was absurd: the system they wanted could handle a surge powerful enough to supply energy to the entire state of California *for three million years*.

Not only was it impossible for any known capable technology we currently had to prevent that kind of surge all at once, but they *specifically* wanted it for this site.

It also seems the more I try to dig, the more I find that I cannot even access the needed information due to insufficient levels of clearance. This was concerning as I was only one position down from the Head Supervisor of this sight. All of it didn’t add up and it seems they are willing to pay us for our ignorance\*. And our ignorance they have\*.

For a moment, I sat there, letting the engine idle as I prepared mentally for my day. That’s when I remembered the text I’d received earlier. I fished my phone out of the center console, and I unlocked it. What had felt like the start of a promising day evaporated the second I saw the message. *It wasn’t Brenna*.

*The sender was an unknown number*.

“*They have escaped, you must find me*.”

My stomach dropped. Just as I was trying to process what I’d seen, another line popped up on the screen:

“*Before they kill us all*.”

Confusion joined the fear now gripping me. *What the actual fuck did I just read*?

For a few seconds, I couldn’t think straight. Was this some kind of prank? A sick joke from one of my coworkers? If it was, they’d picked the worst possible day for it.

But... what if it wasn’t a joke? And what did they mean by '*kill'*? This was a power grid, not some black-site facility. Sure, the place had its mysteries, but nothing about it screamed *serious danger*.

I shook my head, trying to rationalize it. *It’s just a prank*, I told myself, though the creeping unease of the ominous message lingered. I sat there for another minute, collecting myself once more. I glanced into the rearview mirror to adjust my hair and wipe the sweat from my face…

Something caught my eye.

*A figure*—just beyond the tree line.

I quickly snapped my head in that direction, but whatever it was... *it was gone*.

“What the-?” I mouthed looking around me now to see if there was anything else.

*What was that*? My eyes darted back to the same spot in the tree line. *Am I losing it*? I tried to rationalize what I’d seen—maybe it was security or an employee taking an ‘*unauthorized smoke break’*. But why would anyone be standing out there, just beyond the perimeter?

I took a deep breath, forcing myself to look composed in the overhead mirror. I reached into my coat pocket and took a quick swig from the flask I kept hidden. Confidence in liquid form, though it didn’t do much to calm the growing knot in my stomach. I set it in my glove compartment, as they canister only had a bit left.

As I stepped out of the car, my paranoia only intensified. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was... *wrong*.

In the reflection of my car’s side mirror, I noticed something in my peripheral view. *The figure*. This time, it stood a row back in the parking lot, still as a statue. I froze, pretending not to notice. My eyes flicked to the mirror again, trying to make out any details—but just like before, it vanished.

My heart was now beating out my chest. Every instinct screamed at me to get back in the car and drive far, far away, but I forced myself to stay calm. If anyone else saw me like this, they’d think I was high, crazy, or both.

I walked toward the facility, trying my best to act normal. My eyes darted to the mirrors of parked cars as I moved through the lot, scanning for any sign of the figure. And just like before, it only was visible in the corners of my vision.

It wasn’t following me in a conventional way either. At one glance, it was a few rows back. With another glance, it was closer—*just one row away*. Each time I looked directly at it, it was gone. For what felt like an eternity, I played this game of cat and mouse. By the time I was only twenty or so feet away from the gate, my nerves were completely shot.

Relief washed over me as I approached the entrance of the facility’s gate, the sight of armed guards offered some small measure of comfort. Randy, the old but good-natured security guard, waved me over with his usual easy smile. Randy and I were close, and I always made sure to start a conversation with him anytime I could. Today, however, I wanted to get inside as quickly as possible. I tried my best to keep up the performance.

“Hey there, boss man,” he greeted, though his expression shifted to mild concern as he noticed my uneasy demeanor. “You alright? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I hesitated, debating whether to tell him. But what could I say? *I think I’m being stalked by a shadowy figure that doesn’t move when I look at it. Yeah, right*. Instead, I forced a weak smile and deflected. “Just some stuff at home with Brenna. Nothing I can’t handle.”

“Ah, good ole’ marriage drama. I get it,” Randy chuckled, “Just so you know, though—if I find out you’re giving her a hard time, I’ll bury your ass six feet under.” He grinned, his laugh easing some of the tension.

I smiled back, but my unwavering feeling of unease lingered.

I handed Randy my work ID, but I noticed the figure from earlier was gone. *Where did it disappear to now*? The security gate and its surroundings are generally an open area, intentionally that way too. It was only about twenty feet behind me from when I last saw him…

“You sure you alright there, boss?” Randy looked up after handing me my ID back to see me glancing back to the parking lot.

“…Yeah,” I finally spoke after a minute of gathering myself.

I waited for the gates to buzz open. As they did and I walked in, the sense of safety replaced the dread that I was feeling, knowing I would be fine in the facility. As the gate closed behind me, I glanced back one more time and saw movement from the tree line again. It had almost looked like--well maybe the fear was getting to me, but it almost looked like I could see a *couple more figures* in the tree line, sitting there before walking back and fading into the forest.

I made my way to the nearest security station, home to what we liked to call our ""*finest*."" I explained to them what I’d seen. The desk guard leaned back in his chair, unimpressed, and replied in a condescending tone, “We’ll send someone to check it out. Probably just a homeless guy or a junkie trying to camp out.”

I even showed them the messages I had received.

They reassured me nothing real would happen as, “*No one was dumb enough to try and attack federally protected property on U.S. soil, especially when it housed military personnel*”

Translation: *They won’t do anything anytime soon—if at all*.

Still, I had no better options. I wasn’t in immediate danger and my priority was to get to work. I left the security station, entered the main administrative building, and headed straight for my office.

**NEW MESSAGE ALERT**

To: ------------------------------

Time: 8:34 AM CT

*Good afternoon, Mr. (REDACTED), you have a scheduled meeting with Mr. Trevor (REDACTED) at 10:30 AM CT in Conference Room C. Please be advised: attendance at this meeting is mandatory and of high priority.*

*THIS MESSAGE IS AN AUTOMATED RESPONSE.*

The email glared across my laptop screen. I stared at it, distracted by the morning’s events playing over and over in my head like a broken record.

*No one else saw anything—not even Randy*, I thought.

I resolved to focus on work. I logged into the system and began my work: three daily safety checks of the entire grid. On a normal day, all sensors read green, signaling everything was running as expected. Occasionally though, a sensor flashed yellow or orange to indicate a minor error, which was logged and addressed by yours truly.

I then noticed sector 7-B was flashing yellow. *Perfect*, I thought. Though annoying, the problem was manageable and quick to resolve.

But then, as if fate had sensed my day wasn’t hard enough, the indicator started flashing red.

Red meant only one thing: *a serious fuck up*. It wasn’t just a problem; *it was my problem*. Red alerts always required immediate on-site attention, and usually, that meant the next twenty-four hours of my life were stuck fixing it.

I groaned, muttering a string of curses under my breath. Any hope of enjoying my night out with Brenna was now gone. I was pissed.

Still, a part of me welcomed the distraction. At least this gave me something worthwhile to focus on instead of the unsettling shit I’d seen earlier.

I left the corporate building and made the short walk over to the massive hangar that housed part of the grid. It was only about ten minutes away, but it felt a lot longer. The campus was sprawling, with four buildings dedicated to the grid and a handful of others for miscellaneous site operations.

When I reached the hangar entrance, I braced myself for what was sure to be an unpleasant encounter. Inside, I found Mike, the lead engineer—or as I often referred to him in my head, *the lead grunt*.

Mike and I didn’t exactly see eye to eye. Our relationship could best be described as… *toxically professional*. Every interaction with him felt like a test from God. He had a habit of pushing back against anything that came from administration—*especially if it came from me*.

The tension between us was fueled by our vastly different backgrounds. Mike was ex-military, a hard-ass with years of experience in various feats of engineering, which included the B-2 (though that was from the rumor mill). He considered my seven years of college a waste of time.

*His favorite line*?

“*You could’ve joined the military, learned everything faster, and fixed your shitty attitude debt free*.”

Technically, as his boss, I could’ve pulled strings to get him fired, but I’d never do it. As much as he annoyed me, Mike was damn good at his job—*one of the best*. Letting him go would’ve been a dumb, emotional move. But that didn’t stop me from occasionally finding ways to get him back, like enrolling him in HR’s behavior management classes.

“Hey, Mike,” I called out, trying to keep my tone normal, “We’ve got a red alert in 7-B.”

He glanced up from whatever he was working on and smirked, “Oh, great. Another problem. What’d you guys do this time?”

*Here we go again*, I thought, already regretting my decision to come here.

“Listen, let’s skip the formalities, you already know I’ll be stuck here for the next twenty-four hours, so don’t go busting my balls here.”

“Relax, don’t get your pretty pink panties in a twist, I already sent a couple of my best down, they’ll be back any minute now.”

Mike paused, a flicker of worry crossing his face before quickly retreating behind his usual demeanor.

“...That was a few minutes ago, and I still haven’t heard a thing,” he finally said, his tone laced with irritation rather than genuine concern.

Mike wasn’t one to care about others either, it seemed, often giving the cold shoulder and even disregarding safety for results. It was something I’d called him out on more times than I could count, but he’d always brushed it off as no big deal.

“I don’t got time for fucking around either, last thing I need is you up my ass even more than it is right now,” he mumbled, as he went back to working on his project.

I bit back my irritation, forcing a neutral tone. “I’m just the messenger, Mike. Let me know what you find when they get back.”

But even as I said it, I was already over it. His constant attitude was grating on me, and I made a mental note to send someone else next time. *Today’s already bad enough without this bullshit*, I thought.

Just as I was walking back to my office to continue on with my day, I heard it—*the sound that marked the beginning of the end.*

Coming from the distance where 7-B was housed, a scream tore through the air, distant but unmistakable. It was *raw, guttural, and filled with such primal terror* that it didn’t even seem human. It froze me in place, my blood running cold. I turned back toward Mike, who was already looking in the direction of Sector 7-B. His expression was unreadable at first, but as the seconds passed, the same fear I was feeling began to creep into his features. He tried to hide it, but it was there, undeniable.

“What the hell?” Mike muttered low and intense.

He took a step forward, then hesitated, his hand clenching into a fist. “I told them not to—” he grumbled angrily, but his words cut off as we both saw it.

Emerging from the direction of Sector 7-B was a person. At first, it was nothing more than a slow-moving silhouette, but then the smell of iron and salt hit my nostrils. I gagged and doubled over at the mere smell of it, causing my stomach to rise into my throat. I caught myself on a workbench as I held back the urge to vomit. *What was that*? The sound of shuffling feet echoed unnervingly and unrhythmic against the cold metal walls. Then, as the figure approached the overhead light that illuminated him, we saw one of the engineers Mike had sent to check the sector appeared…

*At least what was left of him*…

His body was drenched in blood, a gruesome painting of crimson streaks and gore laid out. His left arm was severed cleanly at the shoulder, while his right ended in a jagged stump where his hand should have been, oozing thick, dark fluid. Half of his jaw hung lifeless from one side of his face. Fractured bone and dangling tendons twitched in areas where it had been exposed. Below, he was disemboweled from the sternum down, his innards dragging beneath him. It was coiling around his legs as he staggered forward, nearly tripping on them. His eyes were wide, bloodshot, and glistened with terror, as if he had seen Hell for himself. He staggered forward, driven by sheer will or some desperate instinct to reach safety.

“Holy.. wh-what the fu- wha- ho-” Mike said in a quivering voice.

We just stared at the current reality unraveled before us.

Then, as if flood doors opened, the hangar exploded into chaos. Engineers screamed, scattering like startled birds, while frantic calls for medevac filled the air in the mix. I saw a few sprinting to the nearest Red Phone to place the call.

Mike snapped out of his hypnosis, rushing toward the mangled engineer.

“JESUS FUCKING- BAILEY, we need to get medevac for you, where did the others go?” his voice barely holding together as he looked up and tried calling to the other engineers, “DOES ANYONE SEE THE OTHERS?!”

He whipped around to face me, his expression a mix of terror and urgency.

“Go and get one of the guards, tell them to radio this in and to lock down the hangar” Mike barked to me as I stood there.

His voice broke my trance. I nodded and turned to run, ready to call in a *Code Purple*.

Hangar employees began to creep towards the hallway leading to Sector 7-B, their faces held with dread. A few dared to step in, their movements slow and deliberate, as if trying not to provoke something unseen.

Then a faint sound interrupted us as it drifted from deeper inside Sector 7-B—*whistling*.

But it wasn’t normal. Something was wrong with it. The tune was off, *warped, inhuman*. A haunting, disjointed version of *Yankee Doodle* echoed through the air, its cadence crawling under my skin.

The PA system kicked on with the accompaniment of red-blaring sirens buzzing throughout the place, jump-scaring everyone, including me.

The robotic voice began its repeating message.

“*This is an emergency broadcast alert, please remain calm and find a place of secure shelter. Protocol 999 will be taking place. Do not let anyone into facilities, lock all doors, and close all blinds until the conclusion of this broadcast. If you are outside, seek immediate shelter. This is an emerge*\-”

I turned back to Mike, my heart pounding in my chest. The fear in his eyes mirrored my own. And then the whistling came again—*louder* than before. It was threading its way through the screams, alarms, and the general, frantic chaos around us. The warped *Yankee Doodle* grew closer.

I grabbed Mike’s shoulder, “We need to get out of here!” I shouted, realizing whatever that was, couldn’t be good.

“Bailey is in no shape to move right now!” his voice horse and panic-stricken.

“Mike, we have to go, we can’t take him—*not like this*!”

He hesitated, torn between survival and loyalty. We both knew the truth—*Bailey was beyond saving*. Even if a medevac arrived in time, how could anyone save someone who’d been so gruesomely ripped apart like this?

Mike made his decision. He knelt beside Bailey, whispering something in his ear. I couldn’t hear the words, but I saw his lips tremble. A single tear slid down his face before he noticed me watching. He wiped it away quickly, and then stood and turned to me, his face hardening.

“Let’s go!”

I bolted towards the entrance, Mike close in pursuit. Around us, others fled in a panic, some ahead of us, others trailing behind. The chaos of the hangar spilled out into the open as we ran, but the sound of that unnatural whistling followed us, growing with every step no matter how far we ran in the opposite direction.

We made it to the entrance with no problem. As we did so, we heard more violent screams erupting from behind us. We turned back and saw limbs from various people thrown into the air. In front of us rushed armed security, military personnel, and other trained professionals responding to the incident inside.

Just then Mike turned to me, “Where are we going?”

I had no idea what to do now. To be honest, I thought about just leaving him and booking it towards my car to get the hell out of this place. However, I knew the entrance to get in or out was locked down during *Protocol 999*.

I glanced over to the gate and saw the same scene being played out as it was from behind us.

*There was no escape now*.

“Let’s head to my office” I said.

We had about a couple minutes worth of running, however, our prime years of athletic endurance were far behind us. If only I had just used that six-month membership to our local gym that work had provided for free annually…

Just as it felt like my heart would explode, I spotted somewhere to hide and pointed to Mike to rest there. We hid in the hedges, hoping the thick cover of brush would hide our location from any impending danger.

As I’m writing this, we are still hiding. I tried calling 911 and they told me to sit tight as they tried to contact federal support as they had no jurisdiction on our property. Hopefully, help would get here sooner than later.

I looked up after a moment and noticed Mike sitting there with a thousand-yard stare glued to the nearest rock he saw on the ground. His appearance sunk in sadness, instead of shock like mine. It was something I wasn’t familiar with seeing from him. After all, this guy was made of bricks, physically and emotionally.

Just as I was about to check on him, a piercing scream erupted nearby, cutting through me like a knife. Mike broke his locked gaze and whipped his head toward me. Before either of us could process what to do, more agonizing wails tore through the air behind us—*closer this time*. Ten feet, maybe less.

Then, sickening noises replaced the screams—*tearing flesh, snapping tendons, and the squelch* of something unknown happening nearby. Each sound burrowed into my brain, leaving scars I knew would never heal.

Silence fell hard. Not comforting either—it was heavy with anticipation for what would happen next. My body felt weak, trembling. We sat frozen, wide-eyed and pale. Neither of us spoke, too paralyzed to even form a thought. The bushes weren’t safe. *We had to move*.

I was about to suggest the idea when Mike seemed to make his own decision. Slowly, he leaned forward and parted the dense shrubbery, just enough to peek through. His movements were deliberate, and careful, trying to remain unseen by whatever might be out there. I watched as his expression shifted. At first, it was confusion. Then his face went entirely still, his breath caught, and he moved back while the brush fell back into place.

“What’s wrong?” I whispered just loud enough so he could hear me, but he just sat there.

Concerned I spoke up a little louder.

“Mike... Mike, you gotta talk to me here man. What’s going on out there? Is it that bad?”

Finally, he spoke, his voice eerily calm,

Hi, I'm feeling overwhelmed and trapped, and I could really use some perspective. 



My relationship with my mum has been difficult, to put it lightly. At the beginning of the year it got to the point where I told her family therapy was the only way I would be open to trying to ""resolve things"". She refused at first, but when I stuck to my boundary on that being the only way I will engage with her, she agreed she would ""if that's what it takes"" & to let her know when & where, but stated she wasn’t happy about it. When I said I needed time to think about it, she replied ""this is what you wanted, and now you need time, I give up!”

I was hesitant as since I initially proposed therapy, her emotional abuse has escalated, & I don't believe she genuinely wants to change, she just wants to regain control. 

Last year, I went low-contact with her, only arranging visits with my brothers and taking them for days out instead of going round. This wasn't sustainable & eventually I resumed visiting them at home, initially not interacting with my mum. I found out my older brother (11) was suicidal, so I fought to get him help because my mum is neglectful, avoidant & was minimizing the situation. This was retraumatizing but I'm glad I was there & advocated for him. That’s when I resumed contact, which she mistook for reconciliation. I guess I went back to pretending everything was ok, albeit more boundaried.

Conflict was reignited at the beginning of the year as she pretended she didn't see my relationship status of my first same sex relationship. She admitted it, making it about how much it hurt finding out publicly. I said I might've told her if she responded better when I came out to her, as she basically asked why I was telling her and said I don't need to go round telling everyone. She denies ever saying that, that I misunderstood, she meant something else, etc. One message she sent was ""I don't give a shit what you are"".

When I next saw my brothers, my eldest brother was telling me that my mum doesn't care that I was with my ex & questioned me in such a way that parrotted my mum & triggered an emotional flashback.

Last week, my grandad told me to meet him for a coffee, which I was correct in thinking would be about my mum. He told me he was only getting involved now as my 11 year old brother has been crying himself to sleep every night over this. Bare in mind I have been parentified & my mum has been using weaponizing my siblings and trying to guilt trip me with them.

The next day my mum messaged me saying ""grandad told me you had a chat. I understand how you feel about the family therapy but obviously neither of us has the spare money to pay for it"" (I told my grandad I expect her to pay half & would get back to her with the fee, as I found a local service with a sliding-scale. I told him I pay for my own therapy but I didn't say I couldn't afford it-not to say that I can, but I would make it work) ""I really want to discuss things with you so we can resolve the situation as I have no idea how you have come to the conclusion that I reacted badly to you coming out. I really do think it's one big misunderstanding we can resolve by talking"" (again, I've explained it's not just one situation I misunderstood that can be ""resolved"" in one conversation, when she can't even have a healthy conversation via text) ""Therefore I was wondering if you would be willing to meet up on your terms. You say the time & place & if you feel more comfortable you are welcome to bring a friend along for support. I really don't want to argue with you, I just want the chance to sort this out."" 

I think that message speaks for itself. The gaslighting has also began to make me question my memory, but I'm trying to remind myself that it's not just about that, it's our entire relationship, the emotional neglect, invalidation, gaslighting, entitlement, contempt.

A couple days later my older brother phoned me up & confided in me that he's upset that me & my mum aren't ""friends"". We were on the phone for half an hour & it consisted of him asking why we fell out, asking to know at least one reason why, saying he needs to know why so he knows why he's crying every night, suggesting we go for a coffee with my mum to try to sort it out, etc. He doesn't take no for an answer & pushes boundaries, which I find incredibly difficult. I hate that he's now parentified. I hate that my mum told them her narrative (which I told her was inappropriate, & she obviously didn't respond well too). I hate that I'm causing the pain. I can't explain how much that conversation broke my heart.

Since my mum messaged, & I had that conversation with my brother, I'm wondering if I should just try to go back to being friendly & pretending everything is fine, as the pain, pushback & pressure I'm causing is unbearable.

I feel powerless and destabilized by her pattern of denial and gaslighting. Every time I seem to stabilize, & my therapy sessions aren't taken over by processing ongoing trauma, something with her knocks me back into the cycle. I’ve lost most of my support system and now only have one close friend and my therapist. 

I feel like I'm at one of the lowest points in my life, it feels like everything is falling apart & it's all my fault, even though I know my needs matter too.
